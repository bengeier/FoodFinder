{"text":"I LOVE this place. It's fun and friendly and the food is really good. Juicy, flavourful burgers that come with many different toppings. Great fries ( I prefer the Waffle fries which unfortunately are an extra 2$). The menu is extensive and I've yet to tray anything but the burgers 'cuz they just call to me  but that have mac and cheese choices as well as other diner faves.
The place does get a little loud but thats ok, it's a gathering place after all. 
I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Fun for the family and they actually make pretty good burgers that you can customize to your taste. They also make great milkshakes. Lots of other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Avoid! Went with my sister, waited almost 30 minutes to be seated (because \"the kitchen was behind\", there were plenty of seats available) even though we were told 5-10. Host never returned even though more people came in after us. 

When we sat down we were greeted by a rude waiter who was also covering the drink / milkshake / sundae station. We both ordered Pepsis. He came back about 10 minutes later with a Pepsi and a glass of water. Took another 5 to get that fixed.

By the time we ordered I had finished my drink and decided to see how long it would take to get a refill without asking - timed 35 minutes, after which I ended up asking another waitress because our waiter was MIA. Shortly after we got our food. 

My burger was barely edible - the meat was decent but the bun smelled and tasted too gluten-y, I ended up not eating the bun. I also ordered a poutine for an extra $3. It was the Susie-Q fries, cheese curds and sauce. It was so cold it seemed like it came straight out of the walk in. Because our waiter never returned to ask how everything was, I ended up asking the first person I saw for a new one (ended up being the manager or something) and got the replacement in about 5 minutes. The poutine was bland. I didn't even finish it.

As far as the restaurant itself, my sister had a broken seat (akin to a rocking chair, the seat of her side of the mini-booth wasn't bolted down). The music was a mixture of modern pop (top 40) and Christmas (even though it has already passed). The bar area is too close to the mini-booths - a large group came in and were practically standing on us while waiting for their seats. 

All in all I paid 18.17$ after tax. The food was bad but the service was worse. Even McDonalds is better."}
{"text":"Such a fun and friendly atmosphere! Have been several times for drinks with friends and always enjoy great drinks and friendly service, along with the fun of playing music from the actual jukebox. They switch up the music options available, so it's always a fun time.

During the summer they have 'puppies on the patio' every Saturday afternoon. I haven't made it yet, but I'm always looking for places my dog can come join the fun. Definitely on my to do list! Along with trying the Sunday brunch!

Overall, such a unique, fun concept. I would highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"It was Dyngus Day.  We had trawled down the Detroit Shoreway.  My husband had waited 25 minutes for a beer at Happy Dog.  Someone else had spilled beer into my shoes.  We had eaten a delicious pastrami sandwich courtesy of Spice.  We had been shot with so many squirt guns because I do not own red clothing.  We had shouted so many greetings to so many perfect strangers.  We had met Guitarman--Cleveland's very own superhero.  He is out there fighting negative g-forces with his positive vibes.

Anyway--all that was left was pierogies.  Jukebox has them, they're reasonably priced, and they're fantastic.  They even have vegan ones with vegan sauces to dip them in.  Good beer list, sausages, baskets of saurkraut, nicely decorated, very cool and friendly staff.  There is nothing to not love about this place especially on Dyngus Day."}
{"text":"The bar is small and has a nice trendy/local vibe. I am giving 3 stars because a waitress never came to get my order although there are signs stating someone will come over. We had to leave our seats to flag down a bar tender. Also, the air conditioning was off during a hot/humid day, the beers were over priced ($10 for 2 beers) and two patrons came into the bar with dogs. I understand that dog friendly places are a plus to some people but not me. I would not go out of my way to stop by here again."}
{"text":"Nice place.  Clean.  Friendly staff.  The menu reads, \"take a look at the JUKEBOOK to learn about some of the bands\", but there is no JUKEBOOK yet.  I will check back next time I go."}
{"text":"This Resto has a very cool 50s theme which is fun....They make the best Resto Mac n Cheese ever...The friends I were with ordered the Burger and Fries....out of the world.....
Cold beer and great table service....My only draw back is the little kids are allowed to run around like a McDonalds Play Zone, which makes adult time a bit noisy.
Other than that, I've been 4-5 times and will continue to return...."}
{"text":"2hours!? We thought this place was just an attraction because of the 50s styled diner theme but you know what? ... It was all that and more! The music playing on the jukebox/photo-booth was just loud enough for us to hear each other chew cos' she's a loud chewer. Tons of variety on the menu from make-your-own burger to poutines to milkshakes to etc. It was delish! Definitely coming back just for the ambiance and the food. 

The service? It's okay. Food came pretty fast despite what others say. 

Next time you're there, look for the greaser in a leather jacket sippin on a cherry soda pop. That's me, cos' The Cobras we'll be headin' back! ;)"}
{"text":"Love the fun 50s ambiance. The burgers and fries are great and I'm able to get a burger served in a lettuce leaf if I don't feel like a bun. If can get messy, but it's a delicious mess."}
{"text":"Great beer selection & food. A little expensive, but a fun place."}
{"text":"Jukebox is a safe bet when you're in the west island and in the mood for good comfort food.
Service is prompt, portions are generous and prices are totally reasonable.
They make one of the best veggie burgers in town - IMO."}
{"text":"Ugh is all I think of. The service was terrible and there's nothing like being frustrated to ruin even some good food and good friends. The menu is very limited which is fine since it a small local bar,  and while the pierogis are undeniably tasty, the kielbasa was not. There was a DJ there who I HOPE no one was paying! He was so bad, loved just showing off LOUDLY over the microphone and being obnoxious."}
{"text":"Love it!  No longer living in Cleveland, however this was a must visit on my recent return.  Overjoyed to share the place with my father.  I knew he'd love the bevs and the perogies.  My boyfriend and I met neighborhood friends here over the winter and it was memorable and comfy. Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Jukebox was worth travelling almost 2 hours from Lasalle to the West Island and getting lost for half an hour and walking forever. It really was. We almost gave up and turned back and went downtown but I'm glad we didn't! 
I ordered the buffalo chicken poutine and a banana split milkshake (which was delicious), one of my friends ordered a burger(not quite sure which burger but he said it was delicious!) with a side of poutine and a cheesecake milkshake and my other friend ordered a chilli cheese dog and a side of poutine with a chocolate milkshake(I think). SO filling, I couldn't finish my food so I brought the rest home. We really wanted to order a desert, but we were way too full.
Jukebox is worth the try and the long distance. The atmosphere is beautiful and breathtaking. It felt like it came right out of the 50's. I will definitely go back, no doit about it. 
But it would be really cool if they opened one downtown(my only complaint)."}
{"text":"Was told about this burger place by my mom who had attended with my sister. Gave it a try last night. I gotta say after hearing what my mom and sister said I was expecting a lot. 
Could have been better but my burger was still very good and I really enjoyed the fries. I will certainly attend this place again and try a different burger."}
{"text":"1st time & definitely won't be the last!!!! We ordered the poutine burger & chaplin franky burger.
Everything was delicious.
Also did a takeout for some friends for chili & brownies for desserts 
Thumbs up all the way around.
Waiter was George..whom to quote Tina Turner is
\"Simply the best\"!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood hangout. Friendly the minute you walk in the door. Try the pierogis, tons of flavors. Plus, it's dog friendly!"}
{"text":"Their portions are enormous! The veggie burgers are very good and surprisingly they have a lot of vegetarian options. Also, the interior decor is very nice. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We are regular customers at this establishment and the wait staff and ownership are very unpleasant. We have a recurring issue where we prefer to have a 1/4 pound hamburger patty with a whole wheat bun. We offered to pay a supplement but nevertheless they  continue to refuse our request. We will stop coming here and spend at other restaurants who appreciate our presence."}
{"text":"The layout is neat and clean as you walk-in. They commited well to the retro diner decor theme and they also have flat screens and a bar for sports enthusiasts. We selected the booth seating area... to my surprise the seat cushion moved completely out of place. No problem, we just moved over one booth, right? Wrong! The entire seat cushion of the other booth was busted too, but it was a little more manageable- (you just can't move -at all- while seated). So finally the seating situation is under control, so I went to wash my hands for the meal. The bathroom was basically brand new with all the updated features, such as scented spray sensors- oddly it smelt overwhleming like piss! When I say piss, I mean farm piss smell. So I looked around briefly... it was the beginning of the night and everything appeared to be clean, and the bathroom had hardly been used- so there was clearly deeper issues causing the washroom to smell like a urinal abused by a group of farm animals with bad aim. Alright, so I got the hell out the washroom and concentrated on removing this urine incident from my nose. Reset... So I went for the full experience, which would be a burger and a shake. The shake (6$) was fantastic with pieces of fudge brownie at the bottom. I recommend sharing between 2 people- it is a meal in itself. Two burgers were chosen: the Sammy D and the Elvis, both on their classic Jukebox white bun (they are said to be \"home-baked\"-nice). I should mention that they ground their own quality beef, as well, which is thoughtful. My critique about the burgers: If I order a preconfigured burger that has warm caramelised onions or warm chili, don't put the cold tomato and raw ring of oinions in the burger, too! I would have liked more of what I payed for (carmelized onions and mushrooms then the other tag-along toppings). The burger is great, though! Tastes like a solid homemade burger. Ours were cooked medium, borderline medium rare, which I'm sure they weren't going for. They were really juicy. Curly fries were tasty and could've been better if they weren't so cold and overly crunchy (made it unplesant to eat a lot of pieces). The traditional coleslaw was good- tasted and looks like fresh coleslaw made in-house. I rate this resto two stars for overall dining experience, the burger 3.5 stars(could easily be 4 with better execution) and the chocolate shake a solid 4-5 stars. Within a 1km walking distance, you can choose burgers from: A&W, Wendy's, Five Guys or Madisons; therefore, the war for your burger buck IS ON in the 'burbs! So, if I was struck again with the taste for a burger in that area, what would I chose? Easy, Jukebox. Why? It's truly the only ALL fresh burger (from the bun to beef patty and toppings) you can buy. And I don't mind paying 12$ for \"a\" burger, because it's actually real food. BTW one burger is good for two kids or a coed couple. I would only order one burger next-time. And I probably won't eat-in. I would takeout and pass on the retro timecapsule (which is done well), but too-family-resto-ee for my sanity. For the record, this place is not trying to be Johnny Rockets, the shake and the burgers are much more fresh and of higher quality. And this place is not expensive for families- you just have to know how to order. Burgers and shakes are good for two-don't be shy- ask for an extra glass and a proper knife and portion your food- because this restaurant isn't looking after your wasteline. Obesity wasn't an issue in the 60's."}
{"text":"Checked JUKEBOX out for the first time and it is pretty rad. The jukebox is awesome - it's not full of top 40 hits - but bands like Cake, Band of Horses, Neutral Milk Hotel, Talking Heads, etc. There wasn't a single song played that night that I had to roll my eyes at and judge a stranger harshly for.  Bonus, the bar gives you tokens so you're not even spending your laundry quarters on it.  The decor of the place is simple with sweet punches of interest, like the music poster nook and the collage in the bathroom.  I didn't order any food but some one in the group ordered yummy looking blueberry perogies (that I think were vegan).  I wish their patio was larger but that's my only complaint."}
{"text":"Bad! Our second visit and we were just as disappointed as the first time. Maybe even worse. My hamburger must have been cooked and reheated several times because when I got it, it was burnt all around the outer edge. The only part that was edible was a loonie size circle in the middle of the burger. I sent it back and of course my family was all done eating by the time I got my new burger. Tried it twice, never again!"}
{"text":"I love this bar. The juke box is free and the selections change monthly. It hosts a selection that has something for everyone, which is nice. I'm glad to see that snobbish music tastes are dropped in favor of stocking a great variety, although you will find plenty of critically acclaimed choices. The bourbon drink is a must have - it's like an updated old-fashioned."}
{"text":"This is a place you want to like, but it just doesn't seem to be doing it yet.  Self-disclosure: I was a little put off because I wasn't given any jukebox tokens after buying drinks.  Did they think I wasn't cool enough?  Even when bartenders passed some tokens out to people at their tables we weren't given any.  There were only about 20 people there.  So on to my review.  It's a new bar so of course it is going to look new, but it just looks too new.  It looks like the finished product on an episode of Bar Rescue.  I would say it looks more like a franchise coffee or sandwich shop than a bar.  Is this a franchise?  The furniture and woodwork and concert flyer pictures on the wall look very standardized and franchise-ish. The bathroom is nice though.  The draft list on jukebox-like signs looks good, and the bottled beer selection is good.  Maybe it will get better with age or some changes to the interior design.  Also, you might find yourself at the mercy of those fortunate to get jukebox tokens.  Hearing some sappy ELO song can really kill the mood."}
{"text":"Pretty cool little spot. We were under the impression it was a restaurant too, think I read some false info somewhere about the menu. They only have perogies which were $7 for 3. We thought that was a little steep considering you can get a dozen for $6 at the west side market. And they were not that good, dough was too tough and chewy. But service was great and moscow mule wonderful...  will be back for drinks not food!"}
{"text":"We've been there a few times; willing to give the place another shot but, that's it.  The sweet potato fries were a disaster, the burger was nothing special and I'm sorry but the milkshake was average, at best, but the real problem is the noise level.  Intolerable; we couldn't have a conversation .  Not worth the money."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a mean burger, an elevated mac n cheese or just a classic milkshake, this is the place for you. The food is excellent. The decor is really cute with obvious 50s diner influences. One down side is that it's quite loud. However, thats never turned off from enjoying my time there."}
{"text":"Jukebox is one of my favorite burger places to dine at. Very fun atmosphere and the staff is very friendly. 
I've gone there countless times and I always go for the Humphrey burger with bacon. You can also choose your choice of bun. (Rye, Sweet Yeast, Pumpernickel, and more)

They also offer a great selection of milkshakes. You can't go wrong with a hot fudge milkshake!
The desserts are amazing, their chocolate cake is very rich and moist. The cookie they serve is warm and topped with your choice of soft or hard ice cream along with a generous drizzle of chocolate sauce. I omit the chocolate sauce, but that's just my preference. 

I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Everyone is super nice and its a great place for a chill night out. I also recommend doing the music trivia, DJ Tone Def is always a riot!"}
{"text":"Nice cute little joint. Really, really good burger but my curly fries were cold. The wife had the turkey patty and sweet potato fries and they were both fantastic. The service was really good. The young lady was very helpful when we ordered and her recommendation were spot on. Drinks are a bit small considering soft drink costs next to nothing on tap. Place was busy, mostly families and everyone seemed to be happy. Service was quick considering how busy it was. I will happily come back but the fries better be hot next time! I would have liked to give three and a half stars but that doesn't seem to be an option."}
{"text":"Nice-looking not nice to eat!!
Do not order mac & cheese worst I've ever had. Out of the three meals I've had here only good one was the spicy chicken wrap.
Fries or just okay nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"I was really unimpressed with the brunch experience this morning. The waiters were really nice but the food took way too long. You get food truck service and sizes with restaurant prices. I couldn't believe when I saw they charge $9-$10 for cocktails and the food comes in a little cardboard tray like what you get on a foodtruck. I love foodtrucks but I also don't pay regular restaurant prices for a foodtruck portion, they are too completely joyful experiences when done right. I don't mind the $10 charge for a drink if I am in an upscale restaurant but I am not sure where they are going with the concept here. Both brunch items we tried were lacking flavor and not worth the cost and the wait. We had the waffle sandwich which had not peach flavor as they described on the menu and my friend had the pierogis and she was really disappointed with the portions. 

I really wish I would have liked this place but they are going too far with the upcharges. I may go back if a friend wants to go just to play pinpong. I thought the ping pong table was pretty cool and I give them 3 stars for that."}
{"text":"Finally! A casual laid back bar in the Ohio City area that isn't on W 25th. I am so happy that they are building up Hingetown. I wish this area existed when I lived in Ohio City a few years ago. 

I loved the vibe of this bar. The decor fits perfectly with the music theme. The draft list is awesome and what they don't have on draft will mostly be made up by their bottle selection. I ordered the 5Rabbit Agave beer- I can't find this beer anywhere else in Cleveland. With each draft I ordered I also received a token to pick a song from the Jukebox. 

This bar isn't a place to come if you want a sit down meal. They only offer pierogies and popcorn. I ordered the Spicy Chicken- Black Bean- Cheddar and Onion pierogies with the siracha sour cream and regular sour cream and found them to be delicious! The spice level was perfect.

Our waitress was great too! She was attentive to our table as well as being very prompt. I recommend this place to anyone who wants a fun bar but doesn't want to deal with the craziness of W 25th.

*Happy Hour is until 9pm!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there for the first time and it was great. The waiter helped me find something I would like (slightly picky) and the dessert pierogis were fantastic!"}
{"text":"I found this a very good place to have a burger with friends. 

The food tastes very good, based on what I ate and the looks and comments my friends had. Service excellent, though the staff was so busy you almost needed a lasso in order to get their attention. 

The ambiance is fun, and loud. Not excessive loudness, but not quiet. Not a place for a quiet meal. Anyone heading to a diner called \"Jukebox  Burger\" expecting quiet needs a reality adjustment. 

The prices seem reasonable for the quality and quantity of food you get. And with wireless payment machines they bring to the table, paying is easy and comfortable. 

All in all, I recommend it. ."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a cosy place to grab a drink,  listen to some tunes and eat some delicious perogies, look no more.

Named after the juke box near their bar that has a ton of music options from all eras and genres (tokens available upon request). Jukebox offers a variety of vegetarian/vegan friendly options and are known for their perogies and trivia nights. The beer list solid selection, the bartenders/servers are extremely tentative and friendly, and they have a large outdoor patio to enjoy. 

Trivia night is a blast in a glass! The host we had was hilarious and rambunctious. The energy is contagious. It may be considered a dive bar but they make the most out of it."}
{"text":"The burgers are not very good, kinda dry and lacks taste for 15$... mcdonalds burgers are tastier and jucier. Also, the mac and cheese apparently had \"home made sauce\" but wierdly enough, it tastes just like good old kraft dinner. We went cause it was featured in Mtlblog, the decor is really cool though. Burger de ville is wayyyyy better!!"}
{"text":"One of my go to places to take anyone when they say their craving something different. Jukebox has a greasy vibe friendly staff and amazing food ! Anytime I've eaten here weather in a large group or on a date staff was friendly and always had great recommendations. There are so many different sides that you can choose from to go along with your massive burger that I'd be surprised if you can finish your whole plate. I tend to stick to the curly fries when I eat here but the onion rings or Mac and cheese are also great sides. Whatever burger you get is sure to leave you full but if somehow you still have room left try a delicious milkshake or my favourite the white chocolate  macadamian nut cookie for dessert. You definitely gotta taste this place !"}
{"text":"Since the West Island lacks a great deal of good places to enjoy a great burger, aside from the typical fast food chains. Over the years I've eaten at Jukebox, since it's been about a year or two I haven't eaten there I've noticed one big thing that changed. Their quality! It has drastically deteriorated. 
On the bright side, the retro decor is bang on in sticking to a classic retro style. Comfy tables, with comfy banquets. 

Now details about the food. 

Just a few days ago my friend and I decided to go to Jukebox, we were craving a good burger. Sadly, I couldn't think of anywhere else to do. We've ordered two different burgers, one with regular fries and the other with curly fries. As for the drinks.. Both had Sprite. Bonus points for Jukebox since they carry the entire like of Coca Cola, including orange Fanta! Sadly, their soft drinks tasted quite flat and watery. 

My friend ordered the Dean Cheese, 1/2lb of meat with the choice of cheese. You can choose the cheese of your choice. *Some have an additional cost. The burger was by no means 1/2lb of meat. It was a little pancake that felt dry and overcooked.  All the burgers come all dressed. Pickles, onions, lettuce, and a minuscule amount of mayo. No Ketchup. 
The buger was very good in size and a beyond generous amount of curly fries. Sadly, they were clearly not cooked to order and had been sitting under a heating lamp for quite sometime. They felt soggy and dry. 

I had the Franky burger, which is an all dressed regular 1/4lb meat burger.  The bun was pale white, overly light and fluffy. The meat patty was dry as well and it lacked warmth. Basically it was warm--ish. 
As for my regular fries... GREASY! Wow.. For each fry that I've picked up with my fingers, I was shinning of greasy. They also felt quite soggy and overly greasy with a unpleasant  batter or greasy batter to them. I didn't enjoy them.
Since the fries were served on a huge pile on top of each other, they've managed to get very soggy. A bonus point for not being salty! 

As for the service.. It was just \"OK\" I find many of their employees lack the interest of working there, and it shows. When I politely asked for mayo, I was given a plastic bottle of Hellman's  mayo that you purchase at the supermarket. Hmmmm..  When I politely mentioned that my Fanta lacked bubbles, our waiter said.. \"Ok, what do you want then?\" I politely asked for a Sprite. Another bonus point, you have one free refill. Only on fountain drinks. If you order drinks by the bottle, be ready to pay a lot more. Overpriced if you ask me. 

As for their desserts. They lack flavour everywhere. Their ice cream is fluffy, light, with a terrible vanilla after taste. Their brownies.. Clearly filled with dark food colouring since the taste of chocolate simply was not there. 

For two people who ate only one burger each and two drinks at the price of $37.00 It was far too overpriced! There are many other burger joints who do have a stronger focus on their quality, customers, and value. I will be steering away from Jukebox and driving further to Chez Tousignant in Little Italy which is far better quality, great customer service and a better value for the quality. Their soft serve ice cream is outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"When I want to hang out with my local friends, away from the 25th buzz I head here.  Alex's spot has great feel.  Cool jukebox and interior, love the back nook for our random Ohio City Game's meetings or for reconnecting with friends. Add pierogies and a great beer selection and this should be everyone's go to, to get away from it all."}
{"text":"Very nice place... Good Vibe... Lovely atmosphere... Decoration and setup is simply beautiful. The service was great... We had fun. Very family friendly and kids friendly. The food is not the best in town but value for money is excellent."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the years, for soccer parties and just with a couple of friends too. Actually, this is our go-to place with 2 friends of mine, not entirely sure why, as the food isn't amazing or anything, its more of a tradition thing now I guess. 

Anyways, on to the food. Came here last weekend for a late lunch with these 2 said friends. I ordered the fried chicken Roquet burger (bacon, Monterrey Jack cheese and onion rings), my friend got a beef Roquet burger with a side of pulled pork mac n cheese and my other friend got the mac n cheese hot dog. Everyone enjoyed their meals, but none of us were able to eat everything. Although my burger was good and the fried chicken excellent, the burger overall was dry and lacked in flavour (I had to add mayo to try and make it less dry). The fries were good, as was the mac and cheese. Everything was good in general, but nothing more and nothing memorable."}
{"text":"Burger is good maybe better than good but not outstanding. Toppings are on point the jelepeno Iwere actually a bit hot. Bun was very good. Fries were limp and over cooked poor at best. Staff got it right just attentive enough but not too much. I can see why Poutine is popular here no one knows how to make correct fries here."}
{"text":"Nasty, nasty place. Don't go. The atmosphere is such a cute vibrant idea but that's where the thrill stops. For and service and price are all"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite bar in Cleveland: great selection of liquors and beers; uniquely amazing and expansive jukebox that also happens to be free (ask bartenders for tokens); double win with consistently a laid back vibe and a solid crowd. 

Customer service is always efficient and friendly. 

Excellent music but thankfully no karaoke or dancing-- just good conversation and a relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere, good service, and great food.
Staff is friendly and helpful.  I had, the prierogi, what the bartender recommend and it was so good."}
{"text":"A group of 6 friends had a hilariously fun night here last night during Music Trivia. The host was so much fun that everyone was participating in things like \"tequila halftime\", song mash-up trivia and limbo.It was like a cozy college party but with people from age 21 to 65, all looking for a good time. Our server was great despite how crowded it was and the beer menu was interesting with something for all (even Abita root beer for our DD) 

The end of the night went badly when I realized the stone in my deceased grandmother's ring fell out and so many friendly people tried to help find with no luck. I was seriously bummed b/c it's all I have of hers but then the bar called this morning and said they found it. The bartender refused to take any money and said we should just be sure to come back. Without a doubt we will as this is the exact kind of place you want to hang out if you are down for some crazy non-pretentious good times."}
{"text":"This is a 50's type diner.  The menu looked incredible. The food was about. 3 out of 5. The burgers were just a bit on the dry side but tasted fine.  The onions ring were very good but were battered and not breaded. This could just be a matter of personal taste.

The service was excellent. Establishment is clean and bright."}
{"text":"I had time to kill so I met a friend for a cocktail.  It was packed as the Indian's playoffs were on television.  I ordered a cocktail and for the life of me i don't recall what it was but it was disgusting.  I ordered another drink and it was much better.  The bartender was very outgoing and friendly...I just think the recipe they were pushing as a special was not very tasty.  We did order perogies that were delicious! I'd return if I found myself in the area again.  The patrons were very friendly."}
{"text":"It's perfectly fine. The jukebox is good but it could be better. The beer selection is good but it could be better. The only thing that needs major improvement is staff training. If you are going to have an extensive beer selection, I expect your Saturday night bartenders to be well versed on the beers you serve."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday afternoon.

Wow- what great burgers! and huge portions!

Service was not the best that's why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars- but the food was really good.

I had the hot rod and the wife had the gleason which she could not finish- I was happy to help! 

The burgers are probably twice the size of Five Guys ones. Don't get the gleason unless you are pretty hungry!

For the people who think it is overpriced/expensive- get real- this is a restaurant, not McDonalds. Just for fun I checked Jack Astors... they have burgers at $14 and shakes at $5. Uhh... that's the same price.

The only slight complaint I would have was the service was ok but not great- they had baby chairs but did not offer it even though I was holding a baby, so I went and got it myself, and  they could not substitute our kids ice cream for a small milkshake because they only have one size... so we got the shake anyhow... and boy am I glad we did... delicious! 

Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while and boy did the food take a turn for the worst. I ordered the Franky it's a reg burger with poutine as the side. The burger was over cooked and dry/tasteless I had to drench it in ketchup and a bit of mustard to be able to eat it...spoilers I didn't finish it. Did the poutine come to the rescue...No! It was just awful, fries were mushy and the gravy meh a bit on the salty side. As for service our waiter was ok had a few jokes but no drink refills or anything like that. There was a ton of kids tonight and they were playing with the Jukebox, couldn't really hear the music but stuff like that doesn't bother me for those who are allergic to kids beware."}
{"text":"Sure people come here for the rotating craft beers on tap. And of course people come here for the love of classic music whether in the jukebox or when you get to bring your own on vinyl night.  But I am in love with all of the non-traditional pierogies!  Peppered beef, loaded potato, bacon mac, spicy chicken and black bean, buffalo chickpea, mushroom sauerkraut, black bean sweet potato, taco, and this month's special, Reuben.  And they have a full list of non-traditional pierogi sauces to go with them.  But wait there's more...they also have rotating dessert pierogies!  This month is a cherry pie pierogi.  This place has my little Polish heart."}
{"text":"This local bar is the kind of place that I wish I had in my own neighborhood. My friend and I were lucky to have this place directly above our Airbnb over the past weekend. It's basically everything you could ask for: extremely nice bartenders, cool rock and roll posters on the walls (duh, Jukebox), an actual physical jukebox to play music on, a huge patio, and plenty of televisions for the sports loving Cleveland crowd. 

The vibe is very chill and welcoming, and I personally loved the daily themes they had every night. My friend and I took advantage of \"pierogi night\" while we watched baseball with the locals, but I laughed when I saw they had \"pizza bagel night\" among other themed nights there! Sadly, we missed out on the PUPPIES (!!!) that came in one night too. There are a few food options for the vegan and vegetarian crowd which is a plus in my book. 

One negative that I'm not holding against Jukebox by any means but it should be mentioned: I did get into an argument with one of the sports fans at the bar who thought it was cool to belligerent trash talk a woman because I was wearing an opposing team's hat. I wished at that moment that one of their staff members could have stepped in as it really made me feel uncomfortable, but instead just got a lot of stares from everyone. I'm guessing nothing was said because he was probably a local. Hopefully my experience that night is not something that regularly happens to everyone watching sports there.

I'd say this bar is a reason to come back to Hingetown and explore the neighborhood more on a future trip to Cleveland. Looking forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"This is bar far my favorite bar in the Cleveland area. Always has a great draft list, personality, bites and events to enjoy (i.e. trivia and what other bar do know hosts yoga on Sundays with brunch following??!) hello! It's amazing! So you should totally go sit on their patio sometime."}
{"text":"A bit late (8-9 pm) in the West Island and dining options disappear pretty quickly.

 We came here, the place is pretty busy with mostly young suburban kids.
I found the burgers a tad pricey (most are $14-16 with fries and no drink)

The saving grace was the small quarter pound burgers with a glass bottled Coke for $10.
Good deal, good burger, nothing amazing. The fries were decent too.

If you're starving though, it's probably best to get the larger burgers, but by then, you're paying $20 for a burger, fries and a drink.

The decor and ambiance were OK, it would probably get on my nerves if I went here too often, too much vinyl and chrome."}
{"text":"The Jukebox is a casual neighborhood bar/restaurant that offers up good craft beer, small plates and of course great music from its jukebox. We had the local beer from Platform Brewery, the Speed Merchant White IPA infused with Blood Orange, which I had never seen around town, and it was very good indeed, Ordered the Pierogies with cheese & black beans at half price during happy hour and the food was fresh & tasty for sure. The bartender & server were very attentive and made us feel welcome. There is a Music Trivia contest on Tuesday evenings that seems like it would be fun. Only downside to this lovely visit, is that street parking is scant at best, we were lucky that a space opened up just as we arrived. I would highly recommend a visit to this fun spot. Cheers!"}
{"text":"The food is great. The service is excellent. The food is served quickly and the waiters are very friendly. The dining area is nice. The decor is awesome. The prices are acceptable. It's not too expensive. You must drop by if you're in the area and are craving some good junk food!"}
{"text":"4.5 for this super chill neighborhood bar. When we arrived, my friend said that it was cozy and unpretentious yet at the same time, cool. Lots of exposed brick and good ambiance. They sell local/Ohio drafts and have a pretty decent selection. Great place to relax with friends or watch a game. The variety of tables also helps divide the space up helpfully - there's a booth in the back, long tables to the side, and smaller ones in the middle. It definitely is very social but doesn't get crazy.

The snacks are interesting - they sell pierogies, and twists on pierogies (corned beef, holiday themed ones, etc) Kind of pricy at 3 for $7, but mine was delicious. You get a choice of 2 dipping sauces too. They also sell sauerkraut straight up as a snack. ?

There is a jukebox, as the namesake suggests... 4 songs to the dollar, but it's kind of confusing because the songs don't play in the order you select them. Really great mix of music, except you won't find any top 40 or pop here. But, you might find Nas' NY STATE OF MIND! 

I'm looking forward to spending time on their awesome back patio!"}
{"text":"This was a great place to eat - it has a great atmosphere although a bit noisy but there are distractions so we were fine with it. The food was excellent and filling. All in all a very satisfying outing. Highly recommended especially for the young crowd."}
{"text":"Jukebox feels like a more intimate \"hangout-y\" kind of place than many of the other bars off W25.  The music is very good and lives up to their self-imposed expectations. More than once I was curious to find out the names of the bands playing. 

Great drink selection as well--seemed like a good mix of cheaper stuff and craft beer.  Happy hr menu had $4 craft beer.  They have a small food menu too, really just for snacks while drinking.  Mushroom and kraut pierogis ftw.

Happy hour goes from 5-8, which is huge if you don't leave work at a typical time. 

The attention to detail is apparent in everything from the music to the layout.  They've done a nice job creating a unique space in a fairly saturated area.  Worth a trip!"}
{"text":"Cheesy looking place... 50's decor but it works for me! I was there for their lunch special. 2 burgers, 2 fries and all the soda you can drink for under 30$. Great deal. And now for the main event, the BURGER! Big and sloppy, juice oozing down the side of my hands. Yum Yum! The taste of the beef really comes through as great quality. I had the Elvis which has caramelized onions, mushrooms and Swiss cheese. They really won me over. In my never ending quest to find the best burger in Montreal, this one took me to the West Island and didn't disappoint. Give it a try."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem, as not many people seem to know about it. I came here once after Harness Cycle (they are right next door). Everyone here is EXTREMELY NICE and it's a place where everyone knows each other, nice to see.

I ordered the Buffalo chicken pierogi's, and they are to die for. SO TASTY. I'm looking forward to coming back. Apparently they have brunch on the weekends...yum."}
{"text":"Jukebox's theme is the old 70's 80's style. They have a really beautiful location and it's usually busy for supper & lunch time. Although their food is a little expensive. They serve quality ground beef for their patties, you can even see the process through a window in the back which I find is cool. However, their most iconic food is the milkshake. They are delicious and are pretty big. Recommend trying this restaurant. Specially if you enjoy American food!"}
{"text":"This is a bit like Johnny Rockets ( with 50's diner decor), but that's where the comparison ends. Jukebox let's you can make your own burgers. Choose your patty, choose your bun and then the toppings. It all goes towards a great result. Don't forget to match your meal  with a root beer float or a chocolate fudge milkshake for the full experience. They also have sweet  potato fries as an alternative from the regular fries or Suzie Q's. As for service, it  was great. One criticism is that the music was a tad loud--make sure you like classic rock and roll. In the end, it's a nice treat for some nostalgia and  very family friendly. It is not the place for a \"quiet\"  romantic dinner unless you wish to seduce with a delicious burger."}
{"text":"The place is all right, looks like an old fashion dinner but you feel like your going to gain 10 pounds just looking at the menu.  The food is decent and classic"}
{"text":"Cute place, good music, great food!  My daughter and I were looking for place to grab a quick bite, prior to attending a play nearby.  As always, we consulted Yelp and found Jukebox.  We were not disappointed!  We arrived during Happy Hour, all appetizers are $2 off and there are also drink specials.  I ordered the Sangria, which was really good, and my daughter had a raspberry IPA, which she enjoyed as well.  The food!  I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was.  We ordered a variety.  The meat and cheese boat was filled with salami, cheddar, mozzarella, jalapenos, pickled onions, cured pork, crostini, housemade juke nuts, and olives.  The buffalo chicken dip was tasty too, serve piping hot with toasted Cleveland Bagels, and celery.  The pierogis were pretty good too.  I also ordered the portobello mushroom sandwich which was excellent.  Marinated and grilled mushroom, fresh mozzarella, balsamic dressing on a fresh bun.  The bartenders were super nice, very personable, and attentive.  All-in-all we had a great time."}
{"text":"I love this place. Everything. The staff, the food selection, the vibe, the wine, the beer, the late night menu.. Love. Good for vegans and gluten free. Good for lovers of fun."}
{"text":"Super chill place to have a few drinks. I went on a Saturday afternoon and there was a nice crowd at the time. Very comfortable seating and feel with a nice bar area to watch a game where things aren't too crazy. There are a decent amount of different drafts (we went during Cleveland beer week and I tried a few I have never had.) Our server gave us tokens for the jukebox-- very fun idea. I had dinner reservations already for that night, or else I would have tried their pierogis. I had no idea they even served food but they have a wide variety of different pierogis to try and they are only 3 for $7. I can't wait to go back and try them with a delicious draft!"}
{"text":"This is a cool neighborhood bar, lots of regulars. Big outdoor patio. They have a good menu too, pierogis and burgers mainly. There are a few places within walking distance so you can park once and hit them all."}
{"text":"Great for Saturday happy hour. Friendly environment and just a great selection. The food is a good for lunch or snack. We will prob be back very very soon!"}
{"text":"Came here 4 times now over the last 6 months and every time it was great.
Came on Saturday night and the place was packed. 
Waited 10 minutes for a table for 4. 
Many reserved seatings. 
Very popular place.

Yes it is pricey but for the mountainous portions you get it makes sense.

A lot of families here with tons of kids who seem to love this concept and love the jukebox where they choose the music themselves.
The restaurant's look is impeccable with a 50's style (plenty of pictures on here to see).
You really feel like you've stepped into a time warp and landed in the movie Grease!
 I was actually seated with Sandy so I was quite happy!

The menu is quite exhaustive so maybe prepare in advance!

The table near us ordered a JJB Challenge which is a $60 one foot high mountain of food, which, if finished in less than 60 minutes is free! 
I asked the waiter where the people that finished it where buried... 3 teens ordered it and could hardly go through it...
Is it possible one person can eat this in 60 minutes? I would love to see that! Or maybe not. Might be more suited for 4 adults!

Our waiter was fine with me but might have been bothered by one at our table that was a bit too complicated about something so simple as hot dogs and burgers. The waiter made a joke which I thought was needed, funny guy!

Ordered as appetizers the chicken wings (which are huge!) and Chilli nachos which were nasty good!

I had the \"Porky Pig\" which is a delicious messy nasty good burger on a pumpernickel patty (the patties and sides are your choice!) with a side of mash potatoes.

Love their milkshakes too.

Even vegetarians can find a burger here!

Our self-described connoisseur of fine hot-dogs thought his bun was hard so discarded it, I ended up eating it, the bottom of the bun was lightly toasted...picky little boy. 
Also got mad about the fact that they don't put ketchup or mustard in his burger and that he had to do that himself with the bottles in front of him.
 \"This is outrageous!\" 
he screamed at our waiter and ran out!
(This last part might of been part of a nightmare I had)
Well at least he liked his chocolate sunday!

He thought this place was gimmicky.

I think it's a wonderful concept.

This is my review so my opinion wins!

Great place, good nasty food, pricier than regular boring burger joints with no concept.
Worth every penny.

Even their washrooms are beautiful.

One negative note is the music wasn't loud enough and at 7h30pm they put the hockey game on with the audio which just killed the whole vibe! Thanks Debby Downer!"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp and then was also recommended to check it out by a bartender at another Prosperity Social Social club and while here on Cleveland I have to say it was probably my favorite place all thanks to the. Hill vibe and people that worked there (and also the best pierogies bit more on that later).

The bartender John was super nice and made it a fun place to be, as were the local patrons that frequented the place. Good selection of local beers, all which I really enjoyed.

Okay, the pierogies.

OMG.

Pierogies are my favorite food as I am part Ukrainian, and very surprisingly, the original potato and farmers cheese pierogies I had here were my favorite from the trip - seriously. They reminded me of the pierogies we'd make homemade growing up. I could've devoured way more but held myself to he 3 I was served with an order.

I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Cleveland as it's \"over the bridge\" and away from the regular downtown spot. Too bad I'm leaving tomorrow or else I'd come again!"}
{"text":"I had a good burger with a bacon poutine! So good! I will say is a must go when you want a good burger for a good price! Burger with fries starts at 6.95$ so cheaper than macdonals"}
{"text":"I've been here for drinking good times on many a nights but I want to review for the non-drinkers.  I couldn't drink when I swung by to meet some friends yesterday (my day was not done).  They offered me a few great options with a smile.  I ended up asking for coffee and they put on a fresh pot just for me, without question.  They refilled my cup three times without me having to get anyone's attention.  It's not like coffee is going to be that big ticket that brings in the tips.  It's not like anyone not ordering alcohol is going to have a big tab at all, for that matter.  But they didn't bat an eye.  This is important because I don't feel like I have to be the odd man out at this joint if I'm not drinking.  I always liked this place as a townie joint.  I like it even more now that I know the service is top notch for even the non-drinkers out there.  Great work Jukebox!"}
{"text":"Not divey but not trying to hard.  A great casual experience from a tiny bar with a big heart.  Friendly staff, decent drink prices, and don't even think of not grabbing one of their signature, full-sized pizza bagels.  Oh and they have a beautiful AC/DC pinball machine that has a surprisingly addictive charm."}
{"text":"If you're anything but a hard-core hipster who wants to relax and enjoy good music, this is not your place.  From the bull dyke bartender with an attitude problem, to the thick-rim glassed assholes who purposely swatted my friend's drink off the table and then pretended that it just fell, I would say there are many other places in town that will happily cater to you.  If this is the future generation of America, we are seriously in trouble."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday and had the meat and cheese tray along with the buffalo chicken dip for an appetizer and then a meatball sub for my meal. Everything was excellently prepared and tasty! Our waiter was very kind and even took a few extra seconds for introductions to get to know us all. This is definitely the place that you want to go back to again, and again."}
{"text":"Johnny Rockets in Canada?!? Not too impress with Jukebox. We ordered appetizer - Mac & cheese with meatballs... Waitress came back and said they had ran out of meatballs?!?! Burger joint running out of meatballs?!?! Does not make sense?!?! Thats a first!  We ended up ordering Mac & Cheese with hot dog... we we got our appetizer, the waitress asked us \"did u need plates?\"... DUH?!?! OMG!!! did she want us to use the paper table mats?!?! This Mac & Cheese was  THE most salty dish I ever!!!!

I had the Elvis burger.... It was avg. I had better burgers that this. When the waitress was refilling our drink, she spilt the drink on my friend! When she spilt the drink the waitress and didn't say a word! WTF?!! She finally came back with more paper towels. 

You'd think they'd comp something, but NO!"}
{"text":"Bigger doesn't always mean better. Don't get me wrong: the burgers were not bad. Not by a long shot. We don't need a burger, however, that casts a shadow over your dinner guest.....or do we??? I found the ambiance fun bordering on cheesy. The burger itself was good - not great. I did, however really enjoy the desserts. They have May-West or Joe-Louis ice cream sandwiches amongst other things. I chose the latter and was happy I did. In the end, the place is OK. Not worth going out of your way for. It tastes dangerously close to a chain restaurant that you might find in small town Ontario or in the States somewhere. Its lacking something..."}
{"text":"To say I was unimpressed would be an understatement. This establishments saving grace was our second waitress.

We walk in and ask for a table of 3, the hostess takes us to a booth and we ask to be seated elsewhere. She instead lowers the blind so we aren't blinded by the sun. After a  five minutes of the sun beating the back of my husbands head and no waiter coming to see us we flag down the hostess as she seats someone else. We ask for another table and we are told they will clean on for us and then we will be reseated. Only then does our waiter come over. We tell him we are moving and he leaves.

We get our new seats and out waitress is quick. She takes our drink order and leaves us with the menu. After a few minutes she comes back empty handed and informs is the bar is back logged and would be a few minutes for our drinks (soft drinks and a juice). She asks if we would like to place our order and we do. She's very well informed about the menu and sides etc.

It didn't take long for us to get our food but upon inspection of my fries (my inspection I literally mean looking at them) you could see that the fries which were supposed to be \"curly\" are limp, cold, and undercooked.

By the time the waitress came back to see us and I told her of the problem I had eaten half my burger. They sent out replacement fries (straight) on the house while they made a new batch of curly. By the time the curly fries came I had finished the burger. The thought from the kitchen/manager to send free fries was nice but does it matter when my fries come after I'm done eating? 

The burger was above average but below epic. My husband wasn't too impressed with his food either but his thoughts on the dipping sauces with the fries was \"store bought\" and the onion rings tasted frozen. 

I will not be back."}
{"text":"Love this place in Cleveland. It is kinda a dive bar but better because the food is top notch and they have games. It's in a good location and the vibe is real local. You don't get too many tourists here which is nice. It stays open till a good hour and a great place to have a gathering or party."}
{"text":"The vibe is great the prices are fine. The highlight fir me is TRIVIA TRIVIA TRIVIA.  The trivia is definitely to hard for me to ever win but the host is a complete delight.  He is fun, upbeat, and friendly. 

I hate that the only thing on the menu is perogi.  I need much more to eat with my libations and most of the options have meat in them. Also seating is limited. But all the bartenders are great and quick."}
{"text":"Came because heard people talking about this place. Won't return but nice place. 

Cute concept decor brings you back to the 50's. 
Great service. 
Milkshakes were great
Burgers were ok but nothing more and I wouldn't come back for them. 
Onion rings were great. 
Mac n cheese if you like American cheese with BBQ sauce ribs is ok."}
{"text":"What a cool little bar! Went here for an event and I thought the food was really tasty, the decor nice, and the staff very friendly! We tried pierogies, sausage and sauerkraut. We even came back to try some more delicious pierogies and have a craft beer at the bar. They also have some great songs on the jukebox, both old and new ones. 

 I would definitely recommend you check this place out! I know I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I thought it was just another burger place but it was pretty good, I'd go again, fun feeling atmosphere and waiting staff. Just remember, it's a burger.... And the Poutine burger is awesome"}
{"text":"The tunes were great and man o man the drinks are fantastic i cant wait o be back- it was great to sit and talk and feel comfy about drinking. the bartender was nice and sweet actually very amazing for helping out picking drinks!"}
{"text":"After reading some previous reviews I came to this place skeptically after being in my Yelp bookmark list for an extended amount of time.

Were the reviews to be true?


DECOR :

You can't help but notice when coming in that this place is the ultimate diner experience at least in terms of decor. Huge comfortable \"banquets\" to sit at that scream the 50ies or 60ies to you. Huge jukebox in the middle of the restaurant. Music from another time compliments the joyful atmosphere. The decor is simply fantastic! It's an experience in itself. I can't help but marvel at accomplishing such an atmosphere and appreciate it.


FOOD :

I ordered the Dean Cheese Burger with a side of onion rings and special garlic mayo. This joint allows you to custom your burger by choosing the type of meat you want and the type of bun you want as well. So I went with the a Pumpernickel bun,  traditional fresh ground beef and Monterrey Jack cheese. I also ordered a root beer float.  If I was going to stack the calories... I might as well do it the right way, right?

And I sure did!

The root beer was ridiculous. It was bigger than my head! What a generous amount! And mightily delicious as well! I recommend trying it! Wow!

The Dean Cheese burger was good but nothing that stands close to burgers you'd find at Five Guys or La Belle et la Boeuf. The onion rings and side garlic mayo however were palatable. I was full but I couldn't help myself and needed to finish it all. What an experience!

My friend ordered the same burger and decided to go with the fries. He felt the same way about the burger and loved the fries. At least those I stole from his plate. :)

He also ordered a May West milkshake and it was delicious! I had some... since the waitress not only gave him his milkshake but the EXCESS of the milkshake (basically 1.5 milkshakes!)

Incredible!


SERVICE :

The service was solid. We got prompt service when seated and got taken care of during our visit. The was the perfect amount of attention. Kudos on this.


PRICE :

I found the price tag to be expensive with most burgers being on average about 15$. For this price, you'd expect excellence but perhaps it was the Dean Cheese burger but I didn't feel I got my value. Most shakes/floats are very reasonably priced and the extras are just about right. So this is where they lose the 5 star rating.


BOTTOM LINE :

I give this place a solid 4 stars. Even perhaps a 5 stars if my burger didn't impress me. Perhaps on future visits (and there be more!) I will correct this score to a proper 5 stars.

I'm happy I tried this place, despite the yelp critics. It pleases me to prove them wrong. People are far too willing to 5 star or 1 star their experiences."}
{"text":"Sausage, perogies , and beer, oh my!
Yeah this place pretty much rocks out with their clocks out! Everyone here is super friendly.  Bartenders are very efficient and they seem to remember  you if you come in semi often.  They have a nice beer selection and a really good happy hour.
As far as food goes they just expanded their menu.  The stand outs are the sausage links which i believe are from the the West Side Market,  homemade sauerkraut and Cleveland health food perogies.
I really enjoy their kick ass patio, and they are dog friendly!"}
{"text":"Do I really need to even explain? This place is crazy! We didn't even know anything about it before walking in. We saw the big \"You gotta eat here\" sign and it went up from there! Food is amazing, staff is friendly.. It's simple.. You gotta eat here!!!"}
{"text":"Best Burger in town! If u dont mind to pay a little bit more, u get good quality food."}
{"text":"Have been driving by this place since it opened and after seeing it profiled on You Gotta Eat Here we finally decided to try it out. Make sure to bring your appetite because the servings are pretty generous. The ambiance is very retro and fun my daughter said she felt like she was in an episode of Riverdale. The wait staff was friendly and efficient.  I had the the Hot Rod (bacon, caramelized onions jalapeno, jalapeno havarti and lettuce) with a side of sweet potato fries and blue cheese dipping sauce), My daughter had the Frankie with a Caesar salad size and a Strawberry Milkshake (delicious) and the hub had the Meat lovers Mac and Cheese. The food was very tasty although I thought my burger was going to be a little spicier and it was a tad overdone but still good. The Mac and Cheese was loaded and also very good. Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Love hanging out here for a drink, and the pierogis are so delicious! I'm happy they have so many vegan options, and their vegan ranch is my FAVORITE. It's so good. I wish they had the pierogis at all hours, instead of switching to a late night menu. We weren't impressed by the ramen when we had it off the late night menu (I thought it was ok, while my friend couldn't finish it). But the pierogi.. are always great."}
{"text":"Si vous êtes du genre péquiste facilement offensé par un mot d'anglais, je vous conseiller de prendre une grande respiration avant d'entrer chez Jukebox parce que le \"bonjour hi\" de l'hôtesse pourrait vous choquer profondément. Pour ma part, le mot \"hi\" m'agace parce qu'il y a plusieurs autres façons de saluer dans la langue de Byron : hello, good afternoon, good evening, etc. 

Maintenant, parlons Jukebox. Le menu est très varié. Bien que leur spécialité soit les burgers, les fans de Mac 'n' cheese, de salades et de wraps seront aussi comblés ! Vous êtes vergé ? Vous pouvez remplacer la galette de viande par une galette végétarienne. À ce sujet, je vous conseille le Burger Béliveau avec galette végé. 

Pour le reste, allons-y rapidement : personnel courtois, endroit très propre, mais musique peut-être un peu trop forte."}
{"text":"This place looks amazing when you walk in and feel like you have entered a 70's diner. Then the longer you spend there the less amazing it became. The service is terrible and it took forever to get our food. I made my own burger but found the burger meat has no seasoning at all, just meat made into a patty and cooked. The fries were not bad but the mac and cheese was not good at all,  one bite was enough for me. The dessert looked good but i am sure it was like most of the stuff in this place. Looks great but leaves a bad taste in your mouth."}
{"text":"Great service! Good food.  Excellent Jukebox.  Good location and overall vibe.  

We have played a lot of Wednesday trivia here and it kinda rules.  DJ Tonedeaf is the country disco schniz.  He actually is fantastic at this.  They often give away House of Blues tickets among other prizes.  Good balance of neighborhood scene and hipster chic.  A safe and reasonable bar.

Food wise we're limited. Same soup for weeks at time, decent sausage sandwich, peirogies and kraut are what is usually on the menu.  I like it once a month or so for food."}
{"text":"Been here 3x in the last 2 months. Bad attitude and service is just getting worst terrible. They always make mistakes. Fries were cold and the waiter start to make excuses and then took the meal away. I said to waiter leave the meal and bring new fries and plate you can have the cold ones. He said no and Then he took the hamburger plate and came back 10 mins later but the hamburger was cold. Manager was not interested when we spoke to him. Guess our $100  meal /business is not needed .."}
{"text":"Maybe it was what i had, but i find the food pretty bland. Over all it was pretty good tho"}
{"text":"Good selection of burgers but it sometimes feels like the combinations are a little random. Once you find something you like, stick with it. Fries and other sides are okay but I've had better elsewhere. As far as sit down burger diners in the west island go, however, it's a decent option."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out in Hingetown and enjoy a beer with friends while avoiding the W. 25th st. craziness.  They have a very good beer list, excellent cocktails and the service is on point.  Try their pierogies.  We split the vegan buffalo pierogies with creamy mustard sauce and some other sauce.  They were so good!"}
{"text":"\"Im going to show my concentration and above all supreme body control, Mike.  I've been working out with my good friend Fuji Hakayito\"

Super Dave Osbourne quote sums up EXACTLY what I was thinking when I stopped here for the first time on a Wednesday night.  Place may be my new hangout and venue to invite women to a arm wrestling challenge.   Sick beer selection and a jukebox that makes me chub up.  Mike the bearded bartender is super nice and actually talks to patrons (unlike most people in the area).  The jukebox get rotated on the 1st of every month Im told.  I played Iron Maiden, Tribe Called Quest and Tom Waits all in one rotation.  That is awesome.  I think the juke only takes the tokens the bartenders give you so some Indie buttrocker or a Deftones dick cant take up 2 hours of music.  Why do people who always listen to the shittiest music always play it loudest and for longest periods of time at bars?  
Now back to my training with Fuji...

{"text":"I used to love Jukebox but after today's meal, all I can say is \"it was nice while it lasted\".

That was the dryest, most flavorless burger I've ever had. The cook didn't even bother getting the patty all on the bun, but just slapped everything together in a sloppy, careless mess.

The fries were way overcooked (it used to come with curly but those are now an extra $$).

The bun was plain, untoasted and there was no tomato (there was supposed to be).

$18 for overpriced cardboard."}
{"text":"Now I want to buy my own jukebox. 

Great place to grab some drinks and eat some pierogi. Bonus points for the vegan options. I enjoyed hearing an eclectic mix of tunes and it was so much fun to leaf through all of the album covers and pick songs to play on the jukebox - for free!

I only wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"Great place for the family to enjoy some comfort food. My burger (Humphrey) was pretty good. The wife had the Philly steak sub that she truly enjoyed. Smoked meat poutine was awesome! My son enjoyed his curly fries. Service was very attentive, very friendly. We shall be back!"}

Went to this restaurant for the first time. My wife and sister-in-law has been there several times, and love this place. We were here with a group of 11, just after lunch
 
Location: Marché de l'Ouest - Lots of parking. West end of the city. 5/5 stars
 
Atmosphere: It's a classic American style diner with 60's décor. Music wasn't too loud. They did have TV's everywhere just in case you didn't want to miss the game. They have a massive dining area, and I'm not sure how long the wait is for a table during busy time. They have over sized booths which are nice, but the floor under my seat was sticky, as if they were not mopped after a spill. 4/5 stars
 
Service: Upon arriving, we waited 5 minutes before someone acknowledged us. There was no hostess at the front or they were somewhere else. After seating, the waiter took our drink orders. Usually, a waiter would come once or twice to if your party is ready to order. I am not sure where he went, but we had to call another waiter to take our order. It took longer for us to receive our food, but that's given since we are a large group (11). The place was not packed, maybe 3 or 4 large groups and a few smaller tables. We've asked several servers to refill our drinks. Only after the 4th or 5th time asking, they finally acted. I don't know if there is some kind of rule at this place where you serve the tables your are assigned, that isn't right. Overall I think the service can be improved. 3/5 stars
 
Food: The menu is large! I have never been to a diner style restaurant with such a big menu. Although it's probably because of all their specialty burgers (poutine burger, porky pig, Honolulu, etc.). There is also 9 types of mac and cheese, 10 types of poutine, and don't forget their hot dogs, sandwiches, salads and appetizers. There was a mix of different foods at our table. I had ordered a poutine burger with curly fries. Nothing really special, it's like they slapped a poutine inside a burger. My wife had the rodeo hot dog with an expresso milkshake. Since we share everything I enjoyed her dish more than mine. The smokey bbq sauce with the pulled pork was excellent and the caramelized onions was like the cherry on top of a sundae. The milkshake wasn't bad either. 3.5/5 stars
 
Price: This place is not bad priced. Considering a poutine burger was $14.45, I don't think I can get a quality burger with a poutine on the side for less than $15. We spent just over $200 for a party of 11. Not bad at all. 4/5 stars
 
Overall: I would go back for the food and try one of their specialties, but part of eating out is the experience, and the service was a bad experience. I think you need to step up your game Jukebox. Will give the service another chance next time we are in Montreal. 3.5/5 stars

{"text":"This place is really good! I wanted to go here for a while and finally did. The menu is big and there's a lot of good and customizable choices you can make. Since I love poutine I decided to get the Poutine Brgr with a root beer float. I chose the honey brown bun, chicken as the patty and Susie Q fries (curly fries) as a side. The burger was so good and bigger than it looks. The root beer float is hugeee my straw couldn't reach the bottom without tilting the mug. I was super full at the end. The service was also really good and I didn't have to wait long for my food. Definitely coming back here a few more times. 
The Poutine Burger is a success!"}
{"text":"Whenever i go out with my sister or friends we always decide on jukebox, theres food for everyone and the service isn't bad. Love the milkshakes and Fries"}
{"text":"Jukebox is a welcoming, happening, fantastic bar, and more or less the glue that holds the Hingetown neighborhood together. There is indeed a jukebox, with a limited but interesting assortment of primarily rock and rap hits, with some blues thrown in for good measure. Purchasing a drink awards one a play but order in advance-- there is often a backlog of requests. The Juke's bartenders are gregarious and the drinks they make pack a serious punch. The Cleveland mule is subtle but sweet, and marvelously drinkable. Though the pierogis aren't necessarily the best in town (tall order when you're running up against say, Sokolowki's), they are diverse enough to warrant comment. I'm looking at you spicy black bean/sweet tater. Yum. The place can get a little noisy, and it is not what you might call capacious, but the décor is admirably slick. There is an outdoor patio which sometimes sports an auxiliary bar in summer and includes--to my knowledge--the only permanent patio ping pong table in the greater Cleveland area. This is also a primo spot to watch a sporting event as a big screen is erected at the patio's far corner for projecting Cavs games, for example. Overall, a real winner."}
{"text":"Unimpressed...

Maywest ice cream sandwich had frost burn. Not taste to meat. Bun could have been stale."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend on a Saturday night around 9 pm. The patrons were mostly people sitting down for table service. We sat at a table and ordered a beer and the buffalo chickpea peirogis. Our server was nice and attentive. When our order came out, I was surprised that the peirogis were so small for their price, $7, and were served in a disposable dish. The flavor was good, just not enough food. I'll be back to enjoy the space, but will hesitate to order food again."}
{"text":"Stopped here to grab some food before my visit in Canada came to an end! 50's styled decor and feel with pictures of Elvis Presley lol cute little joint & their milkshakes were great! But the food was typical. The burger was dry so I couldn't finish it! Nothing special at all to be honest!  Also the curly fries are definitely better in the states! other than that an a-ok experience!"}
{"text":"TLDR: Average food, less than average service

Firstly, let me start by saying the waiters are very nice and friendly. Unfortunately, that doesn't explain the numerous mistakes over the two nights in a row I was there. For example, our orders were forgotten or mixed up. The first night the waiter completely forgot my friend's milkshake. The second night, I ordered the banderis burger and was brought a beliveau. When he brought the lettuce bun I knew it was mine so I waved indicated it was mine. However, I didn't hear him say the name, but my friends did which is why when he asked who ordered it they didn't point it to my direction. When I pointed out it was the wrong burger, the waiter questioned if I was sure I ordered the correct burger. Fortunately, as previously mentioned, my entire group had heard that I ordered the banderis. I would have eaten the burger if it didn't contain two food items I dislike very much: guacamole and mango salsa.
It was also difficult to get a refill of water.

It is rare for me to give such a low rating, but the just a-ok food and all the mistakes means I will not be coming back unless I have to.

I will say that I do appreciate the various bun options and the option to replace your fries with a salad.

If you want mediocre food in a fun environment with great milkshakes this place is for you."}
{"text":"Really cool dive bar off the beaten path in Ohio City.  Came on a Thursday and it was pretty dead.  I heard the food was good but the kitchen was closed as it was late.  The drinks were good, service was friendly and I know we were loud/annoying as it was a group of girls meeting from out of town.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Food is very good, desserts as well. Just the male waiters are not very good from trying to seat a group of 6 at smaller tables when clearly bigger tables available. Then when noted got grumpy and passed the table off to just as bad a waiter."}
{"text":"Service is quick but one thing I have realized in the 5 times that I ate here is that their hamburgers have become quite soggy. The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice, reminds you of the 50's and service is quick. However there is some improvement to do on the quality of the food, most importantly the burgers which is what they're known for. The fries are good and crunchy. They just put so much on their burgers that is falls apart when you eat it. I would rather flavour versus portion."}
{"text":"Looking for an American Tradition burger joint ?!
 
Come on down to Jukebox! lol (not paid for saying that).

I actually love that location in the West Island. They have that modernized Jukebox where you can choose you songs and will be played once it's your turn (playlist).

Staff are amazing, quick and fun to talk with. Variety of choices for entrés, main dishes and dessert. I've tried their burgers and it's fulfilling. Love it . I also tried the Cherry Coke and I can spend the whole night drinking that lol.

Each time I end up to Jukebox, I always tell myself I will get a milkshake... due to the size of the food and how delicious they are ... I never got the chance to try. So if anyone have tried it, please let me know (I love vanilla)...lol!"}
{"text":"My 100% Polish husband was in the mood to celebrate National Pierogi Day out somewhere.

He did some research on the Cleveland locations offering something special and decided on Jukebox. The reviews were good so we decided to venture out. 

We chose a selection of 3 types.
Every order comes with three pierogies and grilled onions.
We chose:
1) peppered beef - potatoes - onion-carrot 
2)Potato - bacon - cheddar- chive - onion
3) Kielbasi - potato - Carraway Kraut
The sides we chose were plain sour cream and Sirachi sour cream, but they have a wide assortment of sides and every order comes with your choice of 2.

My husband really enjoyed the but I felt as if the dough wasn't as it could have been. I was also disappointed by the burnt taste of the cheddar potato ones.

As for  ambience it was nice for a little bar. Nice patio with projection screen to watch the Indians games was set up.
Jukebox is the center of attraction although we did not use.
Breakfast buffet was $10/pp again did not try it."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and I was again impressed. I love the feel of this small restaurant, small bar with maybe 10 or so tables inside. It's got a very old school feel to it, and vinyl night, Tuesday night helps, when you can bring your own or pick from their selection. Additionally, of course there is a jukebox inside. I've only ever tried the pierogis, but that's enough because they are that delicious. We had the special corned beef pierogis with thousand island dressing, I will go ahead and say these were the best pierogis I've ever had and I've had my share! Secondly we had the seasoned beef, potatoes, carrots and onion pierogi with sour cream, it was good, like beef stew in a pierogi, I would for sure order them again. I can't specifically remember the ones we had the last time, but I know they were amazing! They have other things on the menu my group tried and enjoyed. So I highly recommend stopping in, happy hour is a perfect time to give this place a try and it goes until 9pm on Tuesday's!"}
{"text":"Huge huge burger with to die for milkshake. The jukebox inside is fun too. Great experience overall and will go back"}
{"text":"This place has a classic American diner feel to it, the staff works hard at making your visit really enjoyable. They have tons of classic burgers and also specialty items, like the \"hulk\" burger, a cheeseburger between 2 grill cheese sandwiches!

There milkshakes are outstanding from cookie dough to espresso Bailey, incredible. They have a variety of sides from chilli fries to curly fries to Mac and cheese!

Check this place out."}
{"text":"Ew lol It's edible at least, but very low quality. It's good drunk food, because you want something greasy when you're crunked. We went sober though. He ordered some kind of greasy burger with thin curly fries, and I got the salad and a vanilla milkshake, and we split a pulled porc nacho apetizer with 4 chicken wings ontop.

I'm happy the cheese stayed gooey the entire time for the nachos, but there was hardly any salsa. I'm happy the chips weren't too salty, but everything felt very \"out of the can\". Didn't feel like restaurant food. It felt like they went to a local grocery store and bought everything pre-made and threw it all together. Very disapointing. The guacomole side dip was totally bland. The pulled porc was wierd, but it's sauce was yummy. The chicken wings were yummytoo but all different sizes. Ate the 2 large ones first, and the 2 tiny ones 10 min later, which hardened from the air conditioner blasting ontop of us.

The Vanilla Milkshake came with whipped cream and a candy cherry ontop, and they gave me the a the metal cup with the rest of the milkshake in it on the side which was nice of them. The milkshake itself was fine, but very little for almost 10$, I finished it in a few gulps. The whipped cream was warm and gross, and I personally hate candy cherries unfortunately. I wanted the smores milkshake, but when they told me the marshmallows were raw, and not toasted, I dismissed it.

The salad was a joke lol SO MUCH LETTUCE! and they compiled my 4 selected ingredients all ontop to make it look good, but there was nothing underneath besides a tone of lettuce. Avocado was one of my selections, but they only gave me 1/5th of it and left it whole on the side of my bowl. The bowl shape was very cool though, it was tilted up, I think that was my fav part lol the havarti cheese was thinly sliced and not flavorful.

My date looked nausious from all the grease from his burger, and he didn't touch his fries. I was afraid to even try one, they looked like very sad curly fries... so thin. 

I really liked the way the restaurant was decorated, but the air conditioning was way too much, we were freezing cold x,x Gave me a serious case of nippleitis which forced me to slouch my back to hide them behind the high counter cause I didn't want to embarass myself on my 1st date with that guy... thank god my shirt was black! The person sitting behind my date kept on hitting the bench seat and jerking my date forward lol The waitress was incredibly polite, but there were way too many people there. Once it got crowded, it took forever to be noticed and leave."}
{"text":"This place is so freaking cute it blows my mind. I wish there were more locations available. This place is extremely lively on Sunday when I went. It was a full house and the wait line can get pretty long, so i opt to sit at the bar. I believe they have a good selection of everything you'd expect from an old-school diner.

I am obsessed with the decor and atmosphere of this place. Their portions are pretty big, and I feel worth the price if you're considering the entire experience. They have so many beautiful burgers, shakes and desserts that I know I'll need to come back and try them! 

I think this is also a great family place, and a very cute date spot!"}
{"text":"Another hidden gem in the up and coming hot spot....Hingetown.  Great place to watch a game or pop in on Wednesday for Trivia (music).  The host has the best voice and his theatrics make you forget how much music you don't know.  You will find a menu with perogies and not much else.  Tip:  If you aren't into perogies.....eat before your come."}
{"text":"Sometimes circumstances take you out to neighbourhoods that you don't usually visit.  One Friday night I found myself in the West Island to meet some friends who live in the area for dinner.  It was the perfect opportunity to try a restaurant that had long been in my bookmarks: Jukebox Burger.

The restaurant is modeled after a 1950s diner and does indeed contain an actual jukebox.  I have a soft spot for these kinds of places so I really liked the ambiance.  If you come here you come for the burgers and they do a good job of catering to different dietary restrictions.  They offer vegetarian and gluten-free options.  

The way it works is that you choose one of the burgers from the menu and then you customize it by choosing the type of bun, side and patty.  I went for a Rocket burger which was basically just a bacon cheese burger.  The plate was humongous and I was certainly full by the time I was done.   The burger was pretty good but the beef could have been juicier.  The fries that accompanied it were also a little disappointing.  They were a tad overcooked.  

They have a really good milkshake selection here and since it had been so long since I had one I went for a Baileys milkshake.  It went down very smoothly and definitely satisfied my craving for one.  I also tried a mouthful of my friend's strawberry milkshake which was quite tasty.

During prime dining hours you can expect a bit of a wait for a table but they do a good job of handling the crowds.  Once seated everything comes pretty quickly.  The prices are also fairly reasonable.  Burgers run anywhere from $15 - $20 and you do get a lot of food for that price.

A meal at Jukebox Burger is definitely a fun experience.  If you are looking for a 50s diner experience than look no further than this restaurant.  If you're in the area then it is worth visiting."}
{"text":"We've been here twice as a family. The first time we came, it was a \"meh\" experience, but decided to come back a couple of months later in hopes that it was a one-off bad experience.
Unfortunately, the food is bland - nothing appears to have salt in it. Mashed potatoes contained absolutely no seasoning whatsoever, the fries were seriously undercooked (borderline raw) and for what you get, it seems very overpriced. Burgers were fine, but definitely nothing to rave about.
I truly wish this place had better food, because even if service was a bit spotty, I would be willing to pay extra for decent comfort food and for the fun 1950's diner ambience. Unfortunately, our experience at Jukebox left a little something to be desired."}
{"text":"Burgers & fries to die for. Piled on goodies. Root beer floats. Ice cream if you have room."}
{"text":"Super cool place, maybe a little too cool (read: hipster). Indeed, the way-too-cool 20 somethings packing the place serves as my only criticism (but I'm a bit of a curmudgeon, so there's that). Still, I loved the Juke Box. Great menu of pirogies, sausages, and kraut and they have plenty of great craft beers too. Ambiance is perfect, neither over the top on one end or dive'esque at the other. It's a great place to watch a game or hang out with friends. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Like many others, I visited Jukebox Burgers after seeing them on the Food Network. I thought what a fun looking diner, can't believe it's not in the USA! It lived up to expectations. I felt transported to a different time and location upon entering the restaurant. I love the old timey classic decor, music, dairy bar and comfort food. 

Don't be scared by the long lines, it gets packed on weekends but we didn't have to wait more than ten minutes and we were a group of 5. Service is pretty fast. 

I've been twice in two weeks with a group of people and we all enjoyed our meals. For starters, the wings are jumbo sized with a tangy homemade sauce that truly tastes homemade. The chili nachos were the cheesiest and meatiest I've ever had - plus they serve guacamole at no extra charge.
 Burgers are a towering, super sized deluxe creation, and my favorite- the mac and cheese is creamy and filling. I've tried the philly steak mac and cheese as well as the Mexican style which has lots of ground beef, beans and a hearty sauce on top of your classic cheesy goodness. You just can't go wrong. There are so many options and ways to customize, build your own burger and choose from a variety of sides. 
Pair that with a custom milkshake or a cherry cola float served in a giant 1liter glass, it's a meal to remember. 

I went all out, and was so full I couldn't find room for dessert but if you're going as a group and want ice cream they offer this mega platter served in a sink (yes!) Or opt for their Joe Louis ice cream sandwiches with fudge on the side to dip in. 

I'll be back, I need to try more. I'm hungry as I type. 

Bonus- free WiFi. Lots of comfy booths and coat hangers. 
Minus- it's pricey. 75$ for two people on both occasions I went. And very loud. It's kid friendly so expect a few cries/ screams."}
{"text":"I've come here a couple of times for Happy Hour and I am never disappointed. Drinks are fantastic and the bartenders are amazing and always very friendly when I am there. It's also a great place to come on a Friday and Saturday night in Ohio City. I am very over the crowded bar scene at this point and this place looks small but has a beautiful patio and is also away from the craziness of W. 25th. They offer some great small plates and different food specials daily and a great late night menu as well! The old jukebox is a huge plus as well and seems to have the music switched out fairly often so there is always something different. Once you buy a drink or two, the bar will provide you with some tokens to get your favorite jams in. I absolutely love this place and will always be a frequent visitor. Especially in the summer!"}
{"text":"I can verify what many others have stated about the mac and cheese. It is incredibly bland. I don't mean it taste like artificial cheese or that it had a bad flavor. It has absolutely no flavor. 

Also, we ordered a salad to only find out that the olives still had the pits in them. That seems like a quite dangerous oversight for a salad.

On a funnier note, I just watched another guest receive their mac and cheese... her face was priceless. She is not happy... lol"}
{"text":"A crazy choice of \"American diner\" style food. Was not overly impressed with anything. The Mac and cheese had zero taste and the burger wasn't anything special. They do make a mean milkshake."}
{"text":"I am being very generous with my two stars. The ambiance and decor are fun. The service is quick and friendly. The food is horrible. 
The food here used to be good. Now the burgers are dry and even  the buns aren't fresh. Try eating a dry burger in stale bread. Not very appealing.
The cheese nacho and the mac and cheese contain NO real cheese... only some sort of sauce made with powder.
I feel bad writing this review since I have been a customer at this restaurant for many years now. The last 2 times were the last. I don't know what happened..."}

{"text":"BEWARE : FOOD POISONING 




I went here looking for a good burger but what I got was disappointment on top of disappointment.  First the sweet potato fries were cold and soggy, the caramalized onions tasted burnt and old. The burgers were stale and hard to chew... Staff on duty behind the bar was rude and very cheap on giving ketchup packets. Last but not least I ended up getting food poisoning from here. Would I recommend or go back here again? NEVER !  You're better off going to baton rouge and paying the same price for AAA quality burger that won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Great place to watch the game and eat an amazing burger! Perfect for outing with kids."}
{"text":"Pierogies, sausage, great beer and a happy hour that lasts until 9 on Tuesdays!? I'm in! 

Tuesdays are also vinyl night and they let you bring in your own -- so if you have a favorite record, bring it in and they'll play it! Super cool!  

The bar is very laid back with great service and on regular nights they give you tokens to play your choice of music from the jukebox.  It's never been too loud or crowded any night I've stopped in and I appreciate that. 

The pierogies choices are always interesting (mac & cheese!!) and come with interesting dipping sauces.  I think my favorite is the spicy chicken with sriracha sour cream -- delicious!

Definitely recommend on a weeknight for some laid back drinking and snacking!"}
{"text":"Jukebox just opened last night in a neighborhood with a made up name. They call it Hingetown. I refuse to call this area that name. It was a cozy little bar. Most customers were nice. The bar takes recommendations for the jukebox. Customers get a token or two with each drink order to play a song on the box. This might be the only bar in Cleveland that will have Mobb Deep on the jukebox which is reason enough to show up. The draft list is mostly Midwestern and was impressive. Jolly Pumpkin Oro De Calabaza was $6. A back and front patio is coming soon. Brick walls create a nice cavernous bar area. I can imagine drinking here alone and listening to Townes Van Zandt to pass my time."}
{"text":"The service was amazing! And the food was awesome. The portions were big even for the kids meal so my kids could split a meal. Will go back because I want to try all of those milkshakes!!!"}
{"text":"I remembered seeing a sign about brunch outside this place so decided to check it out the morning of the Hingetown Flea. 

When we got there we discovered that brunch changes each week! Not only does the food change, but the chef too! What a cool idea! The website says \"every week we host a Rotating Chef Brunch. Menu changes weekly featuring 3 or more entrees and sides.\" 

This week I tried a pierogi stuffed with chorizo, green pepper and onions and topped with a fried egg. I also had a corn salsa. The food was good. It was served simply in red and white checked rectangular cardboard tray like the kind you might get fries in at a fair. 

The drinks don't change though. The Bloody Mary's use Pope's Original Bold & Spicy Mix. The Mimosa's have Beet Jar (a neighbouring business) grapefruit, orange, lemon and cayenne juice. This made it not as thick as 100% orange juice. The Moscow Mule's have Ohio City Soda's Strawberry Ginger Beer. Of the three the latter was my least favourite and surprisingly the former my favourite. 

I'll definitely be keeping my eye on the website for each week's menu. 

Dogs welcome inside and out."}
{"text":"This is a very overpriced place, with the burgers costing as much as a steak dinner. Also, they sell \"KOBE BEEF\" THAT IS OBVIOUSLY NOT CERTIFIED AND IS AN IMITATION. Shame on this awful place NEVER going back."}

Mon copain à prit la tour Burger,  c'était immense ! La première partie était bonne , mais le bas de la tour était sèche !  
Nous avons été un peu déçu. .. Ça nous a coûté 95$ .. tout de même cher pour deux !"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: Visually, it's a very nice restaurant. It's title is perfect for the vibe that they're trying to give off, the classic \"vintage\" look. And of course, they have a giant Jukebox right in the middle of the restaurant from which you can choose a variety of songs.

FOOD: It's your classic American food. Greasy, big portions and comforting but not the best quality. They give you a lot of fries but they aren't the best. I wasn't able to finish mine. The burgers are pretty good though, just be prepared to bring your appetite as it can get heavy!

PRICE: Quite honestly, the food is overpriced. Everything is extra now, even your choice of sides which is pretty disappointing seeing how the burgers are pretty expensive. I would only come here on rare occasions.

SERVICE: The staff is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Burgers are awesome and the curly fries always are perfect! Service is great even for a busy lunch"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go with family and friends. Very friendly staff and has a lively atmosphere. Has the feel of an old nostalgic type diner. If you're coming here, you'd best forget about any diet you might be on. The food here will give any nutritionist a heart attack :) But that's what makes it so great. From burgers to fries to good old mac and cheese, they've got everything to crush any cravings you might have. Indulge yourself in their milkshakes or floats. Don't hold back. Regret and guilt is best saved for any other night of the week. But while you are there, just enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"It's a great joining of \"local townie \" and \"hip\" bar.  Well placed in the newly marketed area of \"Hingetown\" in the Gordon Square and Ohio City joining place.  We hit up Jukebox after the weekly bridge run that the spinning shop next door called Harness Cycle throws.  We showed up pretty sweaty and gross, which did put us out of place with the otherwise well dressed patrons.

The music selection is astounding!  It's not an electronic juke box so we were more than  happy to find some of the artists in there!  There isn't a bad song selection!  

Add on top of that a great selection of beers.  A cool atmosphere and some totally delicious pierogies (and ahem, I know pierogies!!), I'm very impressed!

It's not a Friday \"go out bar\", but a nice, quiet and meet up with your friends on a weekday kind of bar.  I'll 100% be back."}
{"text":"I am so happy that husband found this gem!! We live in Summit county and have no issue traveling to discover new places. We had a local getaway and decided to explore the west side of cleveland and he researched Sunday brunch and what?? they serve sunday brunch til 3pm
THREE PM!!! and the food is fabulous and the price is amazing. We have been here 3 times for Sunday brunch and the cook is fabulous. We sit at the bar and the bartender is super friendly and we really love the Mimosa's  plus.. the tokens for the Jukebox are a nice touch."}
{"text":"J\"avais vu un reportage de ce restaurant a l 'émission you got to eat here. Hier etant dans le coun nous avons décidé d' y aller pour le souper. L'endroit est populaire il va sans dire mais l attente n est pas très longue.  Le décor rappel celui des diners des années 1950 et 1960 parcontre on se sent assez pressé de commander. Comme nous en etions a notre première visite nous n etions pas familier avec le menu mais la serveuse malgré lui avoir demandé qq minutes pour décider se faisait insistante pour que nous passions notre commande le plus rapidement possible. 

J ai donc commandé le cowboy ma conjointe le heat et mon garcon le taco.  Les portions sont généreuses mais le goût n'a rien d exceptionel et je ne ferais pad un detour exceptionnel pour manger un de leur hamburger. Il y a des options qui a orix sensiblement égale offre une aventure degustative plus wow. 

En général pour le décor la nostalgie et possiblement l ambiance ca vaut la peine de l essayer au moins une fois"}
{"text":"Always a great place to meet up with friends, only one exception. They do have a bartender that is not the best but manageable"}
