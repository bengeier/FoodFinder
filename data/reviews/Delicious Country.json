{"text":"Another restaurant in Chinatown with an obscure English name, that if you were to ask a Chinese-speaking friend if they had visited (based soley on the name), they would have no idea where you were speaking of. Aside from Szechuan Restaurant, Delicious Country is one of the best places to get burn-your-face-off-good Szechuan cuisine. Unlike Szechuan Restaurant, however, the portions are rather disappointing. Like many restaurants in Chinatown, this is not the place to go for attentive service; you're on your own. It's a great spot to grab a quick bite at lunchtime when you're downtown."}
{"text":"Some diners might be put off by the large amounts of chili oil in the dishes but this is what you can expect in Shanghai or in Sichuan Province. Take off your glasses and ignore the oil swimming in your plate and enjoy the fabulous taste of regions not normally represented in Calgary. Delicious Country is a hybrid of authentic cuisine from these regions in China. The noodle dishes are almost exclusively Shanghai, which means oily and hot.

My favourites are the Hot and Spicy Pigs Ears, Zhen Zian Pork Chops, Intestine with Hot Chili, and Stir Fried Beef with Bitter Melon. The last item is tender sliced beef that is tangy and slightly sour and goes great with plain rice, not fried. The taste lingers in your mouth for hours.

The portions are smaller, just like in Sichuan or Shanghai. The restaurant is not being cheap, they are serving your food with same amounts they do in China. Large heaped plates are what you find in Cantonese cuisine.

If you ask for your food extra spicy, they will call your bluff. It might be too hot for those not experienced with really high levels of heat in Sichuan. If you can handle it, then order it hot enough to melt steel. It will be an incredible taste experience. This place is a favourite but albeit a tad pricey."}
{"text":"Love their food. Very very decent Chinese food if you are looking for. They serve big dishes great for gathering, and also fast dishes such as shanghai noodles for lunch if you are in a rush. I choose to go here for food everytime when I go to Chinatown. Recommendations: diced spicy chicken, pork with green beans, fish fillet and chili soup(great), spicy tofu, and lunch noodles. Decent prices and food."}
{"text":"really delicious lunch dishes and really amazing mapo tofu.  next time i'm in calgary i'll visit this place again just for the tofu."}
{"text":"I ordered singapore fries noodle, general Tso's chicken and curry beef. Noodle tasted so bland that I think steamed rice had more flavor. They tasted like eating a spoon full of wet raw flour dough. I wanted to think that it was because they were all swollen from a delivery time. But no matter how many bites I tried they were terrible. Chicken also tasted of flour from the the batter of some larger pieces being under cooked. Curry beer was edible but despite it being curry, it tasted under seasoned. The best part about the food was steamed white rice. We were so hungry but we didn't and couldnt finish the half of the food for they were so terrible. I would strongly suggest to reconsider if you are ordering a delivery or take out. Maybe they taste better at the restaurant but I highly doubt it. I really really wanted to like this place. Instead, now I am just full and unsatisfied."}
{"text":"The most authentic Szechuan we stumbled upon. Delicious food, fast service (dishes came out in less than ten minutes), reasonable portions. Great flavors and extensive menu options. Nothing fancy here, but a great casual place for a quick and comfortable dinner.
Only riff was that the dishes served looked nothing like the pictures on the menu."}
{"text":"An authentic Chinese restaurant in the heart of Chinatown.
But as a non-Chinese customer I have experienced better.

It's not fancy at all, very simple environment and service, but the food quality is good. 
It  probably helps if you have a Chinese person with you when you go there."}
{"text":"Walked by this restaurant and decided to give it a try. So walked in and the restaurant was pretty empty. We sat down and ordered shanghai style beef balls and mapo tofu. 

The shanghai style beef ball was pretty good. Its quite big. $15 was not bad. The mapo tofu is $11. Food wise is ok overall. 

I think this is a family ran business. Service is ok but you can't expect much at a Chinese restaurant."}
