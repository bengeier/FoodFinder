{"text":"This place is friendlier, cozier, and full of edible food and delicious coffee. My experiences under the old owners (of Madison Coffee & Tea) were awful; the \"Red\" owners know their stuff. The inside is warm, bright, and full of Red Roaster gear. 

Though the Attic is closer to where I live in Madison, I do enjoy stopping here when I'm downtown - usually for coffee, working, or reading."}
{"text":"This shop has some great space. I had a plain old latte and just enjoyed staring out one of the huge windows at the downtown streetscape. The latte was good- I actually wish I had tried something more unique. Everyone there was really friendly, and it looked like they have a fair amount of regulars. I was just in town with a friend taking a mini road-trip out of Louisville and we spent a few hours here- did not regret it!"}
{"text":"Went here before the current owners... wasn't impressed... just so-so.  New owners look at this place as a town-need that wasn't being met and have risen to the ocassion.  Coffee here is top-quality and plenty of Starbucks-like options for the non-coffee connosiuer, a bit more than making it at home or McD's, but worth it."}
{"text":"Great coffee and tea selections. I love the atmosphere. It's a wonderful place to meet up with friends and even plan a business meeting."}
{"text":"What an adorable cafe in Madison. As first timers, we asked for suggestions from the staff. They asked about our preferences and made great suggestions. My husband made a special drink request which they were happy to create. Everyone was very nice and accommodating. The espresso drinks are made well. I had a macchiato that was delicious. There ovens are turned off after 7, so we weren't able to try any of the sandwiches. The baked goods looked great, but were a bit disappointing. Mine was undercooked and since the ovens were off it couldn't be warmed, which would've improved it for me. La

The space is welcoming and offers a variety in seating. There were several people there working and studying. The wraparound  storefront offers plenty natural light which also makes for excellent people watching. If you have a craving for well crafted espresso, I certainly recommend it."}
{"text":"Strolling along Main Street on a hot June day hardly seems like the perfect time to visit a coffee shop.  Be that as it may, I did, and it was the perfect place to cool off for a bit.

Red Roaster Coffee Company & Eatery is a small, locally owned shop that breathes the essence of Madison, Indiana.  Prominently situated in the heart of Downtown, the shop is the perfect size.  With large windows, customers are free to take in the view of this iconic American small town.  With stools made from old bourbon barrels, there is no doubt that the shop is a stone's throw from Kentucky.  If one doesn't want to sit on wooden stools or chairs, the eatery has a few comfy chairs in the corner.

The Red Roaster has a basic coffee shop menu.  They have a fine selection of fancy coffee drinks - you know, the tasty ones packed with sugar and have ingredients like mocha, whipped cream, and coconut milk.  I know this because my girlfriend ordered one, but I drank half of it.  Being me, I cannot remember the name of the drink, but it was an iced mocha latte with coconut milk.  Yum!  Of course, Red Roaster also has plenty of regular coffee as well - hot or iced.

The best part of the Red Roaster experience for me was the staff.  I was impressed with their diligence, as well as their ability to tell us all about the City of Madison.

The Red Roaster Coffee and Eatery is the perfect hangout spot whilst spending an afternoon in Madison. I recommend it."}
{"text":"THE MOST RANDOM COFFEE SHOP EVER IN KENTUCKIANA!

Great coffee + Great prices + Great people + Great decor + Great Location

I ride my motorcycle down to Madison whenever I get a chance, and will be stopping here for a double espresso from now on! Same prices you'd expect at Starbucks only in a gourmet hipster joint with ceramic cups/saucers and awesome wood fixtures."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my afternoon at the Red Roaster. They have the most lovely and welcoming staff.  I had tea and a cinnamon roll. Ok tea selection - they could use a spicier herbal tea like a ginger or turmeric. The cinnamon roll was quite lovely. Not too sweet or too cinnamony. It felt a tad overpriced but aren't all coffee shops overpriced? Great ambiance and music selection. I'm in town for a few days each year and could see
myself stopping back in."}
{"text":"Nice little coffee shop.  Plenty of seating and natural light.  I ordered a mango smoothie for the kids and they were happy to split it evenly between two cups.  It was a hit with the kids.  My husband had an iced coffee that he really enjoyed.   We also got a couple of bagels.  They only had plain and strawberry cream cheese.  They also sell T-shirts but I felt the price was too high at $22.  We would definitely stop when we are in town again."}
{"text":"I recently had the opportunity to visit Madison and had heard good things about this coffee shop. I stopped in for a morning latte and was greeted with the normal hustle and aromas I've grown accustomed to. The shop was pretty busy and the line was long but moving quickly. Several patrons were munching on sandwiches and other pastry offerings, all of which looked good. The service was friendly, fast and spot on. 
With the family in tow, our order consisted of several hot and iced coffee drinks. A great plus to this shop is the patio seating along the sidewalk in the beautiful downtown area. Our coffees were hot and tasty. I like my lattes a little stronger but over all not a bad drink. My wife ordered a iced caramel macchiato and said it was very good. Obviously, because I was not offered any. 
Being from out of town it's hard for me to comment on the pricing but from what I noticed around town it was on target. I'm giving this 4 out of 5 simply based on the \"light\" version of a latte."}
{"text":"Like a lot of places in Madison, IN, the Red Roaster has found an awesome way to reuse and restore a historic space in the heart of downtown and bring vitality back to it. This space has been a coffee and tea company for decades, but the owners of The Red Pepper seem to have pumped a lot of energy into it. 

The window is a great place to people watch while sipping coffee, and there's a mix of bites and snacks for any time of a day. Plus, though this isn't unique in Madison, everyone is friendly and hospitable. Whether you're passing through or settling in, the Red Roaster is an excellent place to curl up with a cup."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped by as we were passing through Madison; we wanted to check out the local coffee scene before heading back home to Cincinnati. Here are my thoughts:

Upon first entering the place, I got pretty excited. Having been a barista for years at specialty shops in Cincinnati, I first noticed what appeared to be a La Marzocco Strada (A very high end espresso machine), and a high end Nuova Simonelli Grinder. So, based on the calibur of equipment, I was anticipating a delicious  third-wave specialty coffee experience. 

That expectation quickly dissipated when I saw the menu. I ordered a cappuccino, and was asked to choose a size: 12oz, 16oz, or 20oz. At almost any third-wave coffee shop, a cappuccino is an 8oz drink: 2oz of espresso with 6oz of milk, with a heavier microfoam than a latte. I was able to get the barista to make me an 8oz drink (they were quite friendly and accommodating), but the menu is clearly not a third-wave menu. It was more like the menu that you would find at a Starbucks. 

The quality of our beverages was also not quite what I had hoped. Again like Starbucks, the espresso was roasted very dark, and the milk was overstretched; there was too much foam (at least an inch thick) on the top of my girlfriend's latte; a drink that is supposed to have very little milk foam. Likewise, my cappuccino was heavier in foam than is standard. 

In all, this caf√© fell somewhere between Starbucks and a third-wave specialty coffee shop. The space and atmosphere were great, the service was great, and they had very good equipment, however the menu, coffee roasting, and drink quality didn't quite meet the same standard."}
{"text":"Nice place.. really enjoyed the service and almond milk latte.  Really great find no Starbucks in this small town but this place is likely better"}
{"text":"First off, this space is hard to beat. Bar stools made from bourbon barrels, a beautiful fascade, natural light flooding throughout and clean/crisp decor and tiles/floors. 

I opted for the mango tropical tea on ice (delicious) - I recommend adding a splash of honey. You can thank me later. ;) My partner-in-crime opted for the strawberry smoothie drink which was a little on the processed (fake-y) side for my liking. 

If you find yourself strolling down the main street in historic Madison, I recommend popping your head in for friendly service and a great co-working space."}
{"text":"LOVE YOUR NAME AND LOGO!
We are in town as tourists, off season, and stopped this morning for coffee.  Very nice.  The coffee was strong and very good and my mango smoothie was wonderful.  The atmosphere is friendly and inviting.  There is a window bar with the coolest stools. They are made from old barrels.  If you need a break during your walk about or a warm drink I was very happy."}
{"text":"These folks were awesome.
Clean and nicely decorated.
Scones were killer and the coffee was stout.
Staff was helpful and kind 
I'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"I have to say, I'm not a coffee drinker, but winter calls for warm beverages especially when you've been exploring Madison all day. We wondered in to get a mug of something steamy and non-java. What we found was a sunny, airy place to enjoy a conversation and rest a bit.

The small cafe offers a range of drinks as well as desserts and sandwiches. I ordered a chai latte and a peanut butter stacker and my friend went with a hot chocolate and a lemon bar. My chai was spicy and hot, but very watery. The dessert, on the other hand, was sublime!

Layers of chocolate cake with crunch, peanut butter meringue, chocolate ganache and caramel were topped with candied peanuts. It reminded me of a  Whatchamacallit bar. So delicious and a steal at under $4. I would have paid a lot more for this in a Louisville bakery or restaurant.

I tasted the lemon bar which had a good flavor but would have been improved by a slight warming in microwave (as they had done with mine). The hot chocolate was as to be expected. Both were very reasonably priced.

I'll stop by Red Roaster when I'm next in Madison. It's a sweet place to rest a bit and indulge in some tasty treats."}
{"text":"A great coffee shop that fits perfectly along the strip of shops in downtown Madison! They also have pastries and breakfast sandwiches (and biscuits & gravy on weekends!) as well as lunch specials, such as pimento cheese sandwiches. 
I had a nitro cold brew coffee, which I'm a sucker for anytime I see it on a menu. It was so creamy and tasted too good to put any cream or sugar in!
I loved the ambiance, the bathrooms were also decorated nicely and clean, and the service was fast and friendly. 
I'll definitely be stopping back in next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of stopping here a couple of times for to-go beverages. This great little coffee shop has the friendliest vibe, cutest decor, and yummiest drinks you'll find. 

For those of us who can't do dairy, they have soy and almond milk choices. For plain 'ol cuppa joe drinkers (like my husband), they have bold and mild drip coffee choices. The mild, I am told by a discerning palate, was fantastic.

The large windows that run along (the very cute) Main Street of Madison provide the perfect ambiance for sitting and sipping your beverage. We felt bummed that we had to get going and could not linger. There were great counter tops with stools for setting up the laptop to work.

Their bathroom is large, clean, and well lit. Having fewer stalls that are not cramped is so much better than trying to fit as many as possible into limited space (as is common of other restaurants).

The best aspect of this place is the awesome staff. There were at least a half a dozen folks working and each was upbeat, pleasant, and seemed to truly enjoy working together and and providing a great product an experience for their customers. 

If you're anywhere near Madison, stop by The Red Roaster. We look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for a good cappuccino to come to Madison and it finally has! The coffee is consistently good, they stay open until 7pm and offer breakfast, lunch and snack options. I love the turkey and cheddar sandwich on a pretzel bun. A great place to work, meet friends, write and relax."}
