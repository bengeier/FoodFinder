{"text":"Great staff, good food at a reasonable price. Do  not go here if in a hurry.  The kitchen takes a really long time getting the food out.  Showed up at 1pm on a Sunday for lunch to a pretty empty restaurant, didn't get food until 2. If they were to speed up the service this would be a 5 star review."}
{"text":"Well first off we went for dinner. It was happy hour and it took a long time to see the waitress and then more time for the drinks. 5.50 for a Kiltlifter draft at happy hour isn't cheap. Hate to see what regular prices are. Finally after a long time she came back to take our order. Salad and sandwiches for the five of us. Everybody's food was ok but lukewarm. The fries were cold. You would think being slow the food would come out hot. I never understand why a person depending on tips either doesn't care or doesn't say something to the cook. 5 people won't be going back which is to bad because we're always looking for a good new place."}
{"text":"Really nice neighborhood establishment, with good food and service!  Sort of hidden off the main Grand Ave. drag.  Good food selection and beverages as well.  Nice outdoor patio area too!"}
{"text":"Don't go here. It took over an hour to get our food. It was cold and bacon burnt. I use to like this place but we will not return. No wonder it's never busy."}
{"text":"Went their for breakfast this morning around 10:15 at 11:45 finally received our meal. Their were no silverware on the table when we sat down and took 10 minutes before we ever got our coffee. The place was hardly busy at all . Not sure why it took so long . Don't think we will be going back . Service very very slow"}
{"text":"We stopped in last night for our first time.  Garret, our server was great.  We chose Tuesday night since we noticed online that they offer build your own burger, fries and a beer or beverage for $7.  My husband enjoyed wings.  Service was great.  Food was fresh, hot and tasty.  Tuesday is poker night so on the right half of the restaurant many folks were playing poker and they were not a distraction from our meal. The ambiance was nice also.  They played country music in the background. They are beginning their winter entertainment soon - which includes live country music. It was a very pleasant evening out and we will be sure to visit them again."}
{"text":"Walking in, the place looks promising. We went in for lunch and I was on the clock, so we did not partake of the bourbon selection, which looked decent. 
It took a long time to get our lunch, and when we got it, the food was ho hum at best. I had the Ruben, which tasted like basic Boars head on toasted rye, not bad, but nothing special. the seasoned fries could use more seasoning also.
The pulled pork my friend had was terrible. Tasted like grocery store frozen pulled pork, with an awful bulk store brand BBQ sauce, and slaw that came out of a plastic tub. 
The only reason for the second star is our hard working waitress. 
Not going back there."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here for first time. It is a typical bar decor inside and the place was almost empty. Server was very attentive, but it was a long wait for breakfast. She came over to tell us that the wait was on the poached eggs!  Sounds like someone in the kitchen forgot to boil water. Poached eggs were perfectly cooked, but my husband was surprised by the corn beef hash. It was homemade and also perfectly cooked, but was full of green peppers and onions- not to his taste. No toast was provided as per the menu. Server offered to provide, but hubby let it go. Eggs Benedict was ok but salty."}
{"text":"Where do I start???  We waited 20 minutes for a table, there was no host and tables were open and full of dirty dishes which leads me to believe that they do not have bussers either. 

We finally sat ourselves at a dirty table in the bar and waited 10 minutes for the server to clean the table. another 15  minutes for drinks.  Ordered some appetizers which arrived 20 minutes later. 

This meal was $45.00 and they should pay me for the time I will never get back!

All I can say about the food is that they must have a very sharp box cutter! EVERYTHING was frozen. 

The only reason they got one star is because yelp made me choose!"}
{"text":"We consistently get excellent service from Danielle. She is attentive and makes great drinks. She is friendly & gives amazing customer service."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere, I think we were the wrong color. Maybe if we had on are uniforms we would have been welcome. Still lovin' Surprise Arizona"}
{"text":"I will NEVER go back!!  Fries cold and rubbery.  Burgers dry and my Ruben had some corned beef on half and 2 tiny pieces on the other half.  We were the only table there (other than the bar side) and our server hardly came around to see how things were."}
{"text":"This is a cute little place nestled in the back of a shopping complex. Thank God for google maps. Very pleased with the fried okra. The fried fish was a bit soggy and the coleslaw was tasteless but the staff was friendly and it was clean and well..... the okra was great."}
{"text":"Amazing new bar. Friendly and cute staff. I had a burger and fries, both were good and the drinks were very reasonably priced. We will be back often!"}
{"text":"Stopped into try the latest restaurant to go into this hard to keep spot.  We were greeted warmly and got to pick out seats as it was not too busy, yet.  On Sat their special started at 5 not 4 as noted as the website so we had apps.  Zucchini and onion rings with Cajun ranch.  Loved loved the Cajun ranch only wish for parm cheese on Zucchini otherwise ok. Those in my party enjoyed the okra with blackened catfish and the pork porterhouse chops.  String beans served were good and fresh no cans here. Yum. Patty melt was good as I would expect but loved the shoestring fries with that Cajun ranch.  Good selection of drinks which you would expect based on the name and enjoyed the country music too.  TVs were up so racing and football was the theme of the day.  Overall seemed like a good meal at a soon to be local haunt if location doesn't hurt it."}
{"text":"Went here for the second time in the last two weeks. Unfortunately they don't seem to have it together. Nice selection of beers and food, but the service and food don't meet the most basic standards. We went with a group of 11 people tonight. We called about 30 minutes in advance, but upon arrival no table was set up for us. It took about five minutes to get seated.

After about five more minutes our drink orders were taken. And another fives minutes for them to arrive. Then another 10 minutes until food orders were taken. 

The place was about 10-15% occupied, so it wasn't like they were overwhelmed with customers. So, in another 10 minutes or so, some food began to arrive. Three of us ordered pizza, and one person got theirs when some salads entrees arrived.  Other dishes arrived in 3 to 5 minutes intervals. Drink refills were served rather promptly, but we kept waiting for food. After the other three in my group had finished their dinner, my pizza arrived, along with another member of our party. The others laughed, joking that we had kept them waiting. 

 Most of the group thought the food was just OK and having each of us served over a 30 minute period quite amusing. Needless to say, none of us are planning to return.

I understand the place went out of business a few weeks or months ago, and can only assume the demise of the current owner is again approaching. Hopefully the next owner will have some foodservice experience and make the necessary changes. Until then, none of will be returning, and suggest you find a place offering a much better dining experience.

There are many, many other places nearby worthy of you service and $$."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited for the 1st time last night. I am torn on the experience and the rating I am giving. We both liked the ambience of the place; the back ground music was good, not to loud so we could talk. Everything seemed to be clean. They had several local microbrews on tap that that negated the slow service.
 
We started with the fried okra. It was very tasty; the Cajun ranch dressing was a good compliment to the okra. This is where the service lacked. No plates or silverware to eat the okra with. I found some clean sliver on an adjacent table so we did not have to eat with our fingers. 

Originally, I wanted to order the steak sandwich but was informed they were out of French rolls. Saturday night at 6:30 and they were out of one the key ingredients they would use in several menu items!?  I ended up having the patty melt with the sweet potato fries. I really enjoyed both. They had a great flavor, definitely would have it again. My wife ordered the southwest burger with fries. They had a good flavor and she enjoyed them both. This is where it gets interesting. The menu stated the burger had a number of toppings to include avocado. We waited a bit for our server to come back but it was taking long enough for the food to start getting cold. She was about a quarter way though the burger when the server came back. My wife let her know the burger was missing the avocado. The server in a matter of fact voice said \"it should have avocado but it depends on whose cooking and what he wants to put on it.\" She then walked away without asking if we still wanted the avocado.  We had a good laugh at this and made fun of the other things they could do if they wanted. I think its equivalent to the soup Nazi on Seinfeld \"No soup for you!\"

I liked the atmosphere, beer and food. I am hopeful they can fix the service issues and the place succeeds"}
{"text":"Came with high hopes but after the service and treatment of waiting to be served by waitress and having our check passed onto the bartender chad I would never come back. Besides chad yelling at me when I approached the bar that we have to order through him and he couldn't leave the bar. Not a very welcoming experience to have to fight through bar crowd for more of my all you can eat fish. Beware is all I can say!"}
{"text":"Don't go here.  It took over an hour.  Very-Very-Very POOR service.  After waiting over an hour for a hamburger and fries, I got up and left.  On the way out I went out of my way to tell my server that I was leaving because I was hungry.  She said I had to pay for the hamburger and fries that NEVER arrived!  Very-Very-Very POOR customer service.  Not going back there."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon specifically because on their website they had a great menu and the restaurant itself looks like a really fun place to go with some friends. So after getting the time together with our friends and traveling 45 minutes to meet with them at Bourbon and boots we find that they are closed due to supposedly cleaning. now prior to going on a Sunday at a 5 o'clock I looked up their website and their hours because my husband and I are in the restaurant business and we know that some restaurants have limited hours on Sundays. When we arrived we found that they were closed with no notice on their websites just a small little sign on the door that said they were cleaning. Then when I tried to reach them by phone their business number just kept ringing and ringing and there was no answering machine to inform us that they would be closed on Sunday evening or afternoon for cleaning and when I called Monday at 10:30 and reached a manager he seem to be very indifferent to our inconvenience. There was no apology there was no empathy that we had taken the time to want to patronize this restaurant. Because of his attitude I do not want to ever recommend going to an establishment that care so little about their customers and how their lack of concern put a great damper on our evening out. We found another restaurant but this was a long time reunion coming and all of us were looking forward to the menu at Bourbon and boots because we had heard that this was owned by a gentleman who owns a restaurant in Cavecreek that is no longer open.I do not recommend patronizing this restaurant because of their inconsiderate attitude and their lack of concerned for their customers"}
{"text":"Ok, let's do a quick review while I'm still sitting at the table. Don't waste your money here. The service was horrendous. I ordered an \"old fashioned\" which is listed on their bar menu, took just shy of 20 minutes to receive it and when it hit it table, the top was water from melted ice. Mixing it up I decided to give it a try, bad decision. My taste buds were assaulted with the bitter taste of grapefruit?!? Why is their grapefruit in my old fashioned?!? I sent it back. Ordered a Diet Coke and decided not to bother. We order nachos to share... meh they were decent bar food. 
Major disappointment in the service, quality of beverage and the lack of actual dancing."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Staff is always very cool.  The food is pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink and can't wait to return for a meal.  Cool atmosphere and fantastic service.  Looks a like a great place for live music - we will be back to check it out when it's hopping."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Surprise! From the ambiance, service, food and drinks I give Boots and Bourbon 5 stars! Every server and bartender has a smile on their faces and are so friendly! Specials every night, live music, line dancing, karaoke... So many options for everyday of the week!"}
{"text":"This was probably the worst service we have had in a restaurant in a long time. There were 12 of us at one table. Waited a long time before any wait help even came to our table. We all placed our order (we all ordered fish and chips) .Eight of our party received their orders after a weight. The other four waited 30 Minuets more for their food. The first part of our party were done eating before the last four even got their food. I went to the manager/ bar tender and he said they ran out of fish and their was nothing he could do about it. The waitress said this was her second week. No one there seemed all that concerned about the bad service."}
{"text":"I'm giving it three stars for ambiance and the staff.  The food on the other hand.... The pizza was recommended by several of the staff so we tried it,  and I ate half a piece and my other half politely ate 2 pieces.  The crust is like focaccia, which would have been nice to know ahead of time as we dislike it.  Next we tried the Caprise sandwich...  We'd both suggest that they make this a salad not a sandwich as it just doesn't do well as a sandwich unless it's grilled . We will go back and try a few other dishes because the staff is very friendly and quick to serve."}
{"text":"We are just moving into the Sun City area. And despite last weeks reviews. We decided to try it, since we were told it's a Seahawks friendly Bar and Grill. We loved everything about it! The waitress was very friendly and awesome. The food and drinks were delicious! We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"FOOD: OK. I had the taco salad - it was plain but pretty good. Husband had the french dip - same. 
SERVICE:  Slowwww.  This place appears to be more of a bar than a restaurant which I think is part of the reason. One waiter covering the whole dining room.  Kitchen was also slow in getting our meals to us.

WORST: We were a group of 9 senior citizens, with several separate checks.  Separating the checks was no big deal- waiter did that all correctly.  
BUT, what he wrote on the checks to indicate our table # was \"Big F***ing T\" (for Big F***ing Table I guess)  So each of our senior citizens had to read this when they looked at their check.    
I've uttered many a F*** myself so I'm not shocked.  But I am offended that a restaurant would let a waiter get away with this unprofessional behavior.
AND THEN:  Asked waiter about it. He blamed it on the cooks. (right) We asked to see manager. He said he would get manager. Instead he took the checks, changed them all to Table #9, and returned them to us.  Manager later came over to our BFT and had heard nothing from waiter about this.

Guess it's just not our kind of place... I like things a little more respectful and professional. Just saying..."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time!!  Hotdog and mac n cheese or pbjs at home would be much better than this place.  Walked in and it was cold.  So cold the waitress put on someone very large carhart jacket that was down to her knees.  Disappointed that the menu had no fish since it was Friday night.  We noticed people at other tables had gotten their food.  Looked behind us and noticed they had a fish fry. Our dinner came and we said we wished we knew that they had fish.  She said , well I asked you if you were here for fish.  NO she didn't!!   Never offered to change it.  Very little on their menu.  Food was terrible!"}
{"text":"Great place to go on the weekend. They have entertainment and very happy crowd. Food is good and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Wow. Used to be decent food and half decent service. Now it's mediocre food and a waitress that truly didn't want to be there. Add on not great music you can't hear over. Disappointing evening at best...."}
{"text":"Just had the breakfast burger and it was amazing. Great service all around from the bar where I sat to the cute server that also came over to make sure we were taken care of"}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast and server was sleeping in a booth.  I ordered off the breakfast menu a French toast breakfast with strawberries I was told you were out of strawberries so I got no fruit on my breakfast. When I did receive the bill and was charged six dollars for French toast and three dollars for bacon that on the menu I was told order off of that was a breakfast French toast with strawberries and your choice of bacon or sausage for seven dollars so I was overcharged the server didn't seem to care about that and said well those are the old menus we don't have new menus.  I will not be back ever"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, looks to have a good local following, we went on a Saturday evening for dinner. The place was busy with only two servers, and thus the cook delivered our food. The food was hot, and tasty, but a little pricey."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today. They had a Chamber construction special : $5.75 for 2 eggs, 2 bacon or sausage, hash browns, 2 pieces of toast + bottomless coffee. Entree is normally $6 without coffee. 

Inside there is a bar and dining area, also an outside dining area.  Lots of Tvs (no closed captioning) and country music playing.  Appears to be a dancing area near the front.  

Took 30 minutes from ordering to get our two specials. Food was hot and cooked to expectation.  The other four couples in the dining area had the same wait.  Server was not attentive - first \"bottomless\" coffee refill was 15 minutes and we had to ask for that and the other two refills.  Toast came out late with an excuse from the server that there was a mixup in the kitchen.  

We enjoy trying new restaurants and love to support our local businesses.  Unfortunately we will not be back or recommending this place to others."}
{"text":"Why this place is always screwed people?????

You can see menu but when ordering, oh we don't have that , oh today we don't serve that, oh sorry we are out of something....
Get the hell menu off then!!!!!!

My morning screwed, going to get food in different place !

Order drinks here, if they have your stuff but no food or check if they have RIGHT ingredients!!!"}
{"text":"OK,
I don't like giving one star reviews, I can prove that my looking at my history. 
With that said! If we had the opportunity to give a \"0\" star review, this would be the best time! Never even had the chance to eat there. Had to walk out and go eat at Texas Roadhouse instead. 
I get it, you were busy. I am patient enough to wait and give you the benefit of the doubt. However after you walk by us three times, and I asked for the menu's. Don't give me an attitude. All I wanted was the menu, you could have dropped them off on your way serving another table. 
Wanted to give this place a chance, I enjoy going to small businesses and spend my money with them. Sadly, this place has a worker that does not appreciate our business. Owners need to look at your employees, especially the older blonde who has an attitude to your customer. Not going to waste my time with this place, most likely you'll be another small business with limited time."}
{"text":"Looks like the new owners were just as bad as the old ones. Even under new ownership I would never step foot in there to even give it another try. Poor service, mediocre food, unknowable wait staff. These people do not know how to run a business."}
{"text":"Per their facebook page, the business closed as of 2/3/2017

{"text":"on November 11th 2016 I was joining a party of other employees at about 6:20 p.m. because the group of us had ordered a couple pictures of beer and I'd ordered a single glass of red wine within minutes he brought back the two pictures of beer and some empty glasses and I didn't say anything I figured his hands were full he was going to bring back my wine he did not I watched him serve five six other customers and finally after about 10-15 minutes more like 20 minutes I got up and was heading to the bar to find out what was going on he came around the bar and I asked him where is my wine and he goes I'll get it to you as soon as I'm done with this order and I just kind of looked at him with a blank face and he came over to our table to take our order appetizers I put my hand on his order pad and said you should be serving my drink before you come back and take another order I have been waiting and watching you waiting on other customers he said he'll have to wait if you don't like it I will not serve you at all tonight and I just said well I'm not going to patronize your business then I'm going to leave I was not drunk I wasn't drinking I was in a good mood tonight before I even got a chance to enjoy friends my friends this place is disgusting that bartender is disgusting disrespect I just thought was flabbergasted at the amount of disrespect I got from this guy I'll never go back there again I will not recommend it"}
{"text":"Very poor service.  The waitress took our order but after waiting 40 minutes for absolutely nothing we left."}
{"text":"I just moved to town, saw this place driving by and thought I would try it.  I even read the reviews on here and still went knowing what people were unhappy with but I like to form my own opinion.  The first table we sat at had giant rips in the upholstery right in the middle of the seat.  The booth was covered in crumbs and remnants of the previous diner.  We decided to move tables and switched to another booth.  As I sat down at this one, I noticed napkins shoved under the legs of the table across from me, I guess to level them up.  The waitress was friendly and came to our table quickly as it wasn't that busy.  I asked if they served an IPA.  She quickly pulled out a wrinkled up beer list from her pocket, handed it to me and said there they are, I can't remember them all.  After the beer arrived it was terrible... I ended up ordering a Fat Tire but it was more like a Flat Tire... the carbonization was gone completely.  The meal was okay, the hamburger was probably 25% fat meat so it was very greasy.  The fries were fantastic.  I ordered another beer thinking maybe it was just the tap but I was wrong, it too was flat.  We ate our meal, the waitress cleaned the whole table and still had not got our check... I eventually walked out leaving my wife to pay.  Me leaving caught their attention and the waitress came over and said I'm sorry this is the problem with me as the only waitress.... there was maybe 3 other tables eating.  I won't go back.  Sometimes I give a second chance but I could tell these issues run deep.  It's a shame, nice building in a nice area with a cool patio... could've been great."}
{"text":"Went in tonight for date night and they had a great band, the Van Reed Brothers. Food was good and drinks were good but the music was great! Would definitely go back to hear them again!"}
{"text":"Service was awful. The staff repeatedly ignored  us when we walked in.  After several minutes we left and will never return"}
{"text":"Do not go here to eat food. Worst meal ever. Staff is horrible. Slow. Overpriced. 17 bucks for a small sirloin and then have to order a side salad because it doesn't come with it. Steak was so tough and gristly that I had to stop eating it before I choked. Friend with me said he was on low carb diet so he would like more green beans which were suppose to come with it. 45 min later when it comes it's corn on the cob. No beans.  The manager should go to Texas Roadhouse and take some serious notes on how to treat customers and cook food for a decent price. Otherwise he won't have a job in 6 months and this place will be closed."}
{"text":"It's not too bad, a typical burger joint with some country style background.  The place is a bit pricy, but the decor and seating is very nice.  Their signature burger was very good, and emitted the perfect blend of meat, sauce, and bacon.  I personally feel they need to have better french fries, or at least cornbread.  The only problems I feel with Boots and Bourbon is it's horrid location, and nothing there that'll make it stand out from the rest.  Why head here when there's a huge variety of options on Bell road?  The food is good, and there is tons of potential, but there's that extra umph that's holding them back.  I even think something as silly as having them all wear cowboy hats and talking in a western accent will help a lot."}
{"text":"My family & I went there for dinner for the first time 2 weeks ago. The style there is pretty cool and our waitress was very friendly. HOWEVER the food was awful. Over cooked, no seasoning, just blah. Even for \"bar food.\" I think if they revamped the menu and perfected some dishes that place would be a hit!"}
{"text":"Came in with my husband and son around 2pm. No one around to greet us. Once seated we ordered nachos as an appetizer. The chips were stale and tasted like canned cheese with no real flavor. We also both got a salad...very plain, and again no real flavor. For the main course I had prime rib and my husband had chicken fried steak. We both agreed that was good, but not anything to make us come back a second time. My son ate a few bites of mini corn dogs, but wouldn't finish them. Service was good once seated and that's why I'm giving two stars. This place is more for the drinking crowd as the bar was packed."}
{"text":"Too cold in there! Expensive beers after  happy hour.  No happy  hour food specials. Burger cooked medium was great. Limited  menu."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? The band was okay, but they had the microphone turned up so loud it was piercing.

I ordered the sirloin($17) and my husband ordered the flat iron steak ($16). Both tasted like they had been marinated in lemon, so they had a somewhat sour taste. Definitely not something you want when craving a steak.

Both of our French green beans were undercooked(still crunchy) and they didn't bother to cut the ends off. To top that off, my husband's baked potato was still raw on the inside. 

My sweet potato fries were good. They remind me of the Alexa frozen sweet potato fries I get at the grocery store.

All in all, I wasn't able to eat my steak nor my green beans and will have to go spend some more money on something I can actually eat.

Very disappointed that they don't take more pride in their food with such a pricey menu. We won't be coming back. Save your money."}
{"text":"Food was average at best.  Draft selection was good but small.  Decor and staff were great.  However, the less than averG food and location will make it difficult for this place to last long..."}
{"text":"First off, I was a little nervous to set foot in the place after walking by 6 vehicles with stickers supporting Trump, but I braved it and went in.  

I read reviews and I didn't experience the long wait time to be seated.  So, this might be a hit and miss thing or, it depends on when you go. 

After being seated, we got our menu and it was extremely limited.  It was a one sided laminated sheet of paper with a little over a dozen entrees.  

I don't eat much meat and I decided that I just wanted a big old salad so, I ordered the Caesar salad while others at the table got their stuff.  

On the menu, there was no mention of chicken at all but, once they brought it, there was some cold slices of chicken.  I picked it off and just gave it to someone else.  

The server was nice and I can tell she didn't want to be there.  Overall, it decent and would have gotten a higher rating if the menu was accurate."}
{"text":"THEY ARE OPEN!!!! And under new management. I had one of the best patty melts of my life here yesterday for lunch. This place is sooo cool, want to come back on a weekend and throw down a cold one as they have an impressive bar. They are reconstructing the menu so I am excited to see what they will be offering as I met the owners and they have decades of successful restaurant ownership. I loved pulling up and seeing golf carts and lifted trucks so they cater to anyone there and they have tons of tv's to watch. I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure where all of the negative reviews came from. We had a couple of burgers and a dozen wings and I threw down a couple of mixed drinks with bourbon. The wings were nice and saucy and really crispy and our burgers were cooked great and the fries were hot and crispy.  My drinks were well mixed. Not too strong but also not weak. My only real gripe was with the menu. On the website it had different sauce choices for the wings and in the restaurant neither the waiter or menu told me what wing flavor options were available to me I chose something every place offers hot and bbq but  besides that I was satisfied with what My experience."}
{"text":"Had their special burger and beer for lunch today and was excellent! Huge burger on a toasted (fabulous) bun, served hot from the kitchen with a generous serving of fries. Could not have been more pleased! Great deal at $8.99 including the beer! Will definitely go back!"}

Good and friendly service

{"text":"We thought we would give it a try since its new...I got the rueben which the meat was too thick and overcooked which made it so tough I could barely chew it...make the meat thinner and put more on the sandwiches it will take better...not a fan of the little thin fries either...my boyfriend got the Philly said it lacked flavor...my friend got the burger sliders..the chz was cheap barely melted on...the bun wasnt good so she tried to cut the burger up...the burger was so hard it shook the table trying to cut it...mozzerella stick were good u get 8 since they are the Skinner ones....I'm hoping that once they are more established its better and maybe it's because they are so new and starting out...also the server had long blond hair and she kept playing with it and it wasn't pulled back..."}
{"text":"I came here once with family and the prime rib was good. The beer was cold and the music was entertaining. I was sad to hear it closed down recently, we were planning on making another trip. The waitress wasn't the friendliest person, but if you want cheery bubbly waitresses you go to TGI Friday's."}
{"text":"Food is subpar and the waitress never even offered to refill my water glass."}
{"text":"New owner better place! Hey! Things will change! Dog friendly. Brian is fixing all the mister system!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for music on the weekends, but the food is terrible.  I were there last night and ordered a chicken quesadilla which came out soggy, loaded with peppers but VERY little chicken.  It was a cold mess.  A friend of mine had a soft pretzel which was over cooked.  How can you ruin a pretzel??  I've also had their hot turkey sandwich and it was pathetic.  If you go there for the music - eat somewhere else first."}
{"text":"Worst ever fish and chips & soggy coleslaw. Service was  very slow and they seemed understaffed. Will not visit here again unless we eat somewhere first.
They need a new menu and chef, possibly management as well."}
