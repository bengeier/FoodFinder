{"text":"Really good quality. Excellent attentive service. Fish menu modest but excellent quality! Will definitely bring family and friends here. Jazz music and nice relaxing ambiance. Everything we tried was the extremely fresh and prepared and served meticulously. Would be nice to include a tea pot but at this point, I'm really just trying hard to find something to improve..."}

Call me a sucker for sushi and especially rolls! Tokugawa is by far my favourite sushi restaurant in the Greater Toronto Area.  There are, however, other sushi places I love closer to downtown, however this is my number one spot and since is close to home, it makes it even better.

Another Foodie friend of mine introduced me to this Japanese/Korean restaurant about 4 years ago. Can't believe its been that long. 
I never used to like Sushi that much, but ever since I went to Tokugawa, I became a fan of all things Japanese. Trust me, soon you will see reviews on very good Asian places outside downtown Toronto, that will help you decide on your next dinning experience...for those of you requesting more reviews outside downtown.

Back to Toku (or Toka how we call it).  Their menu is extensive, rich and gets its inspiration from Japan and Korea. What I like about Tokugawa's rolls is that they are 1) big, 2) very fresh and 3) very different from one to the next.

When we go to this place, our menu order is comprised of the following: Big Boat full of - Hurricane, Rock and roll, Kiss of Fire and Red Dragon rolls.

The Hurricane rolls are our favourites. They come with succulent deep fried scallop and crab, cream cheese, tobiko (aka fish eggs) and avocado, all wrapped up in seaweed (see first row of sushi from right to left). I think their secret is in the taste of the rice as well as a secret ingredient I can't quite define.  The rice is moist, the fish is fresh and the rolls are so big, you will struggle to fit one in your mouth. With just one order you will be guaranteed to be full. 
The rest of the rolls are also very tasty...Kiss of Fire really is a more elegant version of spicy tuna but bigger than how they serve it at the average sushi restaurant. Rock and Roll comes with deep fried shrimp and crab meat, avocado, tobiko and cucumber. And lastly, the Red Dragon roll comes with crab, avocado, cream cheese and cucumber all wrapped in sushi rice and fresh salmon sashimi (see last sushi row from right to left). All in all, a boat that will take you all the way to the deepest side of Japan (or at the very least Etobicoke!). 

If you thought Etobicoke did not meet the mark for sushi hideouts, you thought wrong. Tokugawa will prove you otherwise, and if not, you will for sure enjoy your time here as the restaurant is family owned and the chef and the waitresses know how to take care of their clientele. 

Enjoy!

{"text":"I am a regular here. I usally order a la carte: salmon, tuba, yellow tail & toro sashimi plus a maki roll for rice. Great everytime. Fresh is key and this place gets it. I have yet to taste forzen or yucky sushi here.

Green tea is good here, miso soup comes hot. The house salad could be better. Oh and the uangi is great too. 

Bill always comes to around $50 for two people ordering like above."}
{"text":"I came back here again, and this time the mackeral was fine except that they keep adding unnecessary things to the sushi that (in my opinion) ruin it.  For example, on my mackeral sushi was a giant pile of seasoned tobiko (fish roe).  I know they might just be trying to give you value for money, but for god's sakes, I just want some plain mackeral sushi.  Is that too much to ask? ! 

This time around, there was no salad but some strange deep fried pieces of breaded pork covered in sesame."}
