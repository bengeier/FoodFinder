{"text":"The server didn't smile at all.  The guy at the cash register (could be the owner?) seemed like a grouchy old bastard.  The food wasn't bad, but I've had better.  The service was the deal-breaker for me.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I don't mind this place, I'd say it's mainly for older people (seniors), decor is outdated but the food is good enough  and the service is great ."}
{"text":"Update: It looks like they recently increased their prices. I used to be able to get a simple breakfast sandwich with home fries and coffee for just under $11 with tip. Now it's nearly $14.50 and they charged me 75 cents to add a tomato to the sandwich. Talk about nickel and diming."}
{"text":"Way back in the day this place was packed......oh but now it is a disappointment - I ordered fish and chips here and the fish was greasy and sub par run of the mill batter.  Really wished I had just went to Balmoral instead - wasted my money and a whole lot of calories on a crap meal. :-("}
{"text":"I had an enrolment seminar to conduct in Ajax this morning.  Given the nature of the client, the meeting was held at a restaurant called the Station Street Grill.  After everyone left by 8:15am, I knew the highways would be jammed with traffic of people heading downtown to work so I waited it out by having breakfast there.  I had eggs, peameal bacon, fried potatoes and toast. I also had milk (I don't drink coffee).  It was HUGE and soooooo good ... I couldn't finish it all. And it only cost $7!!  My server was very attentive. I would definitely go back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"WASTE OF TIME! The order we placed was two coffees,  2x 3 eggs, choice of bread, bacon, and home fries and 1 Monte Cristo to share. We waited over 50 minutes! I drank 5 cups of coffee. At 45 mins the waitress comes over to apologize for avoiding us and NOT making eye contact because the kitchen hadn't even started making our food! All she offered to remedy the situation was a discount on our food, didn't tell me how much of a discount, and some more coffee. When she came back with the coffee she said it would be another 15 minutes. I told her \"your telling me that they need 15 minutes to make our order? so they haven't started yet\" and she said yes. Well we left. If you need an hour and ten minutes to make a BASIC breakfast order, it's probably not going to taste good. BYE FELICIA!"}
{"text":"Actual rating 3.5.  Really adequate at best.  I was immediately creeped out by the fact that the booths had very badly stained upholstery on them.  After seeing all the stains, I couldn't possibly feel comfortable sitting back in my seat and let my hair touch that nasty fabric.  Looking past the stains, I couldn't help but notice that the entire decor of the place felt like a tired dentist office waiting room.  Not very appealing to say the least.  I got the three egg and four slices of bacon breakfast.  I asked for eggs sunny side up and they were a bit overcooked.  The rye toast was dripping with butter, so points there, lol.  The home fries were tasty, but I couldn't have more than a few because I am sure they were laced with MSG.    All in all, the meal was decent.  The server was pleasant enough, but it took a while to get our food."}
