{"text":"Good food, love to stop by for coconut with lime and chili powder/sauce. Reasonable prices. Open until 9pm"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this place went to a new owner because sign outside says grand opening and the name is different El Imperio De Sabor. I got a Chamoyada, a mix of sweet n sour, mangos and chamoy, and ice with cacahuates. The place is clean, Staff are friendly.. They sell Thrifty Ice cream as well... I'd come back for sure."}
{"text":"I was very impressed by the nice staff and the morning Chorizo Burrito was so very tasty."}
{"text":"Nice place that opened not too long ago in the Maryvale area. It has TONS of desserts on the menu, lots of little snacks, and is complemented by a small menu of Mexican junk food like chimichungas, carne asada fries, or sonoran hot dogs.

When I first came here, I thought their take on the hot food available was unsatisfying, but as a work in progress they are making leaps and bounds in the right direction. Last time I came here my food was tasty!

It has a bit of an identity crisis, however. Is it a restaurant? Is it a dessert shop? They do it all, but I haven't had anything that stood out yet. They'll keep getting better, and I'll update my review accordingly. Until then, I'll be stuffing my face with some fresas con crema. Yum!"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst ice cream place I have been too , paid $20 dollars for 2 raspados not only that they where nasty ! I was so disappointed ! Never going back !"}
