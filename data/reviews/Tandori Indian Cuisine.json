{"text":"First off: I should note that I actually ate at the Bow Valley Square location but there doesn't seem to be anywhere to actually review that location. In any case, it's chain so it has the same menu and probably same recipes.  I would give this a 0 if I could. The only good thing about Tandori is you get quite a bit of food for what you're paying. I suppose that isn't a good thing when the food is so terrible. First off, let's talk about the rice: some of it is hard and crunchy, not because it's raw and uncooked, but because it's been sitting in the warmer so long it's dried out and overdone (now, to be fair, I was eating at 1330h so maybe it's better at lunch hour). The curries don't taste like typical curries (Indian or otherwise), the spices are all wrong. And whatever they use to make some of the curries creamy (like their paneer with peas or the butter chicken) is not good and is all wrong (it isn't what a traditional curry would have in it). Finally, the chicken in the butter chicken was of questionable quality.   One more random thing but they were out of cutlery. I can eat without but for fast food Indian on my lunch break from work, I'd prefer not to.  I would never go here again, I can't imagine how they stay in business."}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend to anyone, food is bland, not fresh, dsnt feel like anything close to east Indian food, in face, my 5 yr old boy would probably cook it better than them.  I don't see myself coming close to them again.  I'm going regularly to east Indian places, this one is probably the worst I've ever tried."}
{"text":"First of all, I am no expert in Indian Cuisine and frankly I am mostly just infatuated with Butter Chicken. Now, I have no idea what the difference is between good butter chicken and bad butter chicken besides the fact that if the chicken is not good properly I am going to probably get a stomach ache or something.  There is only a few places that I usually have lunch at inside The Core (aka TD Square). While my friend and I made our rounds walking to each place to see if we wanted to eat this or eat that we walked past Tandori and saw the Butter Chicken bananza.  I ordered the Curry Meal that came with Butter Chicken (my choice), Salad, Masala Potatoes and Rice.  The salad I could have definitely done without because it was just your average mixed salad but what I really didn't like about the salad was the dressing they used, I'm not a foodie or anything so I have no idea what dressing it was or what was in that dressing but all I knew was I didn't like it at all.  I really was impressed with the butter chicken, it looked good sitting in the tray waiting to get scooped up for individual orders and it looked even better when my fork was about to scoop it up into my mouth. I mean I need to taste some real butter chicken so I can compare but for this review specifically I really like the taste. I really wish they could give some naan bread as well with it and not charge you even if it was one piece. Actually they might have but I really don't remember anymore lol scratch the last part of my last sentence. The potatoes were just potatoes I can't really say whether I liked it or didn't like it but I ate it anyways.  Honestly, if I am craving some 'fast food' east indian I wouldn't mind giving this place another go for sure."}
{"text":"As a Southern Californian visiting Montreal, I wasn't expecting too much from a food court Indian fast-food in the middle of Laval.  I was pleasantly surprised when trying this place. Their food is surprisingly very good- the flavor is on point, with both main dishes and sides tasting quite nice.  Fair prices and portions too.  I'm very familiar with Indian food, but I noticed the staff here was very helpful helping the locals understand what was available (while speaking in English, French, and Hindi!)  Ultimately, I would definitely come here again next time I'm craving some good Indian food."}
{"text":"don't waste your money... we had the \"3 curries\". except for the chickpea curry, we couldn't eat anything at all. way too bland. besides this experience, staff was friendly but this doesn't compensate for the below-standard experience"}
{"text":"I was surprisingly impressed with the food from this unassuming counter in the Carrefour food court.  I ordered the Thali with beef curry, chicken khorma, and saag.  All the dishes were fresh and delicious.  Servings were very generous.  I'll come back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my go to places in Carrefour Laval food court.  Here there are many options and the food is generous well seasoned with aromatic and fragrant spices and offers chicken and many vegetarian options.  You can choose one two or three food items.  They have naan, rice and biryani to compliment your dishes.  My usual selection is usually biryani with two vegetables.  Usually palak paneer and a vegetable curry.  Many people go for the butter chicken.  I have it once in a while but prefer lentils and veggies.      There was a time I would joke with my Indo friends my middle name should be Sanjay or Deepak I love Indian the spices of Indian food so much! It really awakens the tongue! Here understand it's food court food but if you prefer something different Asian it's one of the better options in Carrefour Laval.   Make sure you test some of the green chilli sauce near the cashier.  It's spicyyyyy!     2 Items with a drink should run you $12-ish 3 items should be $13-$14 taxes in."}
{"text":"This is fake Indian food. I was very disappointed after the first bite. It has no flavor at all. I ordered the butter chicken and it was completely tasteless. It was like orange food color mixed in with chicken on rice. I ordered the combo 1 and it came with potatoe and salad. The potatoe was tasteless too. This is rare. Usually potatoe should have potatoe taste. Maybe they cooked it too long. The salad was the only thing with flavor because it was drenched in dressing.   So disappointed. I will and not recommend anyone to go back there."}
{"text":"Horrid food pretending to be what should be succulent and aromatic Indian cuisine.   What is Chicken Biryani? What it's not is chicken pieces marinated in tomato pur√©e laid over insipid orange coloured rice. Dry potato side was tasteless. Boiled potatoes have more flavour!  I feel bad for the lovely asian ladies who take care of this cruel play on the mispelt word 'Tandori' named outlet."}
{"text":"Got the butter chicken and beef spinach curry. Doesn't taste like India food and really small portions.  Maybe I should have known since it was run by 3 Asian ladies. LOL. Will not be back."}
