{"text":"Friend of mine in Laval told that this place just opened near his house so we went to check it out.. This is actually some of the BEST pizza I have had in Montreal. Moved here from the US a few years back and have been having a hard time finding quality pizza.   They use premium ingredients and their cheese is INSANELY GOOD.  Worth a visit. They need to start delivering."}
{"text":"service is horrible. very mean impolite and rude employes disgusting! their was no sauce on my prosciuto pizza and as a italien myself, i know that in a prosciuto pizza theirs supose to be sauce on it. They gived me a dirty look and refused to put sauce on my pizza. Unprofessional. the pizza was blend, even my dog didnt want to eat it. i dont recommend this place to anyone! their is better pizza places in laval. 16$ for a no sauce pizza? what a joke."}
{"text":"They use fresh ingredients on their pizzas and sandwiches. Prosciutto is freshly sliced. The bread is freshly baked, large portions and stuffed to the brim. Good value for your price and they deliver in St. Dorothee."}
