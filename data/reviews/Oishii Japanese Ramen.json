{"text":"Not worth it even if it's cheap.

1. First impression - Walked in at noon for lunch and first thing our group noticed was the weird smell that the restaurant had.. it smelled like we entered a public washroom...
2. Food - Ramen was too soft, soup was tasteless and very watery, shrimp was tasteless, egg was pretty much hard boiled. Basically the food was far from a decent ramen. 
3. Service - I ordered the shrimp Wonton ramen but i got the shrimp ramen instead. I never bothered to ask for the fix because we waited for a good 20 min for 3 ramen and there were only 2 tables including us at that moment. I didn't feel like it was worth the wait.
                  - We tried to get the waitress attention by waving our arms for a good 5 minutes. We thought the waitress was busy as she was staring at the counter top but she slowly lifted her arm and her cell phone was in her hand. She ignored us cause she was busy on her phone when there was only 2 tables in the restaurant.
                  - We asked for separate bills but that took another 2 min for her to ask another staff at the back to let it us know its not doable. She's not well trained at all and she doesn't know the first thing about being a waitress... attentiveness.
                 - She gave us change and when she did, she slipped the change out of the change plate and it almost fell over the counter top toward my friend and I. 

Overall, food was terrible, atmosphere was terrible and service was HORRIFIC.

You would only go here if you desperately want something to stuff your stomach as they compensate their lack of flavour and taste in their food by increasing the portion of their ramen."}
{"text":"No ramen here, don't even know what to call their noodle soup. Looks like ramen but tastes like nothing. 

Service: didn't even notice our arrival after a few minutes. Another customer had to advise the waitress. 

Value wise it's terrible. I would consider paying $4.99 for what I had but got charged &10.99.

Has a strange/oily odor upon entering, could be residual smell from previous operation. Nonetheless, it's mildly repulsive."}
{"text":"It is, as posted before, a \"Japanese-style Chinese Ramen\" sort of place.   Noodles are just medicore, but what they fail in taste and texture, they make up for in size.  Portions are huge unlike a lot of other Ramen places which let you fish for your four noodles in a sea of soup (Ippudo are you reading this?).   Prices range in the 6.99-9.99 for noodles with 'additions' running from 50 cents to  2.99 ($1.99 for an additional helping of noodles).  

I had the Char Siu ramen ($6.99) in Miso (extra 50 cents) which was alright.  Miso had enough taste.   They also have some izakaya-esque dishes on the menu running under $10 dollars, but I can't comment on taste or authenticity as I didn't try any. 

Service is amazing.  We were one of two tables there and waitress was very attentive (vs. some establishments where waitresses are playing candy crush on their cells in the corner while I'm trying to lick the ice cubes to stave off dehydration..but I digress).  Water is always refilled, waitress checked up regularly.  THEY SPEAK ENGLISH!

So if you're looking for authentic, shipped straight from Japan Airlines Ramen, you're better going to J-town or something.  But for big portions, ok-ramen, cheap eats, this is your place."}
{"text":"There is nothing too Japanese about Oishii Japanese Ramen aside from it's name. 

Come here and expect  \"Chinese\" style Japanese Ramen then you won't be disappointed. Huge Portion! We tried:

Volcano Ramen ($8) ????
Tenderous Ribs Ramen ($8.50) ?????

I felt like I was served a bowl of bottomless noodles.... maybe just both ramens did not taste too good. The taste and smell of kansui (alkaline mineral water) was just overwhelming.

Service though is excellent and attentive! The waitress kept refilling our noodle with more soup and tea cups with more tea without asking!

Btw, why is there Chinese Chili Oil for Ramen? Maybe chili oil would make everything taste better?!"}
