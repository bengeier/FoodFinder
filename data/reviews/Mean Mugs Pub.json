{"text":"Just opened in not so old pacers former location , figured we would give it a try. My wife ordered patty melt with onion rings which she was happy with . I had fried cod and fries.Even at low price of $10 the one piece of fish was small portion.normally cod is light , tender and flaky . This was hard to cut with fork . After taking couple bites , finding it chewy with stronger then usual fishy taste , I noted interior of filet to be raw . Notified waitress who said she would make new fish even I didn't want more( lost my appetite, and worried about getting sick) After wife done eating ( about 15 min later ), owner came to table with more fish. Which I informed him I didn't want at this point plus my wife was done eating .He was very defensive and couldn't understand why I felt my Saturday date night meal was ruined.He really should of kept attitude in check , apologized  adjust the bill and leave it at  that. He did comp the meal ,but a ruined weekend diner can't be undone."}
{"text":"The staff is always very nice and welcoming! I always love coming here to watch sports especially because they have a good beer selection. The food is delicious! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch with the kids on a Tuesday - $2 off burgers.  Had the mugs burger - really good - large juicy and delicious.  Sat outside on a nice summer day .   Daughter inlaws had hangover burger - was good but the mugs burgers was best.  Had a grilled cheese on either side, onion rings bacon and BBQ sauce - great.  Fries were good   Highly recommend - worth the few miles from i90"}
{"text":"Probably the best pub food I've ever had. Everything they have is top notch and delicious. Great beer selection and a patio bar was the icing on the cake. A+ service, food and experience."}
{"text":"Very cute little place, nice staff, good food, not that expensive! Overall had a great experience here!"}
{"text":"The wife and I went twice within a week, we couldn't stop thinking about how good the burgers were the first time we went, so we went again.  Between the two of us on the two visits we tried four different burgers, a couple of single half pounders and a couple of burgers with two quarter pound patties, all four were excellent, very tasty, not to mention the hand cut fries, cooked nice and crispy, the way they were meant to be served!  We enjoyed the nice happy hour prices from the bar too! The wait staff was awesome, last week we sat in the dining room and yesterday we sat in the bar and experienced swift and friendly severs both times.  Hopefully this will continue! We look forward to trying other items on the menu and look forward to being on the nice patio as soon as the weather breaks. Keep up the good work Mean Mugs Pub, we'll be back soon. This could turn into our new go to Friday night happy hour place!"}
{"text":"Good food and service.  Love the prime rib sandwich.  Moscow Mules are very tasty and refreshing."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to the quality of this place since it changed ownership but went in to a not so friendly waitress we ordered our drinks 15 minutes later they arrive place the food order immediately and got back greasy wings and soggy french fries. It's like they didn't allow their fryer to come back up to temperature. I love to this place the Before the name change.It seems like it's not the same place unfortunately I will hate to see it go. And by the way what's up with the angry looking dog that looks like  has rabies as your logo kind of offputting if we didn't know what the place used to be we would have not even stopped kind a looks like a logo you find outside of a biker bar"}
{"text":"My wife and I go here constantly. They have the best food around. The burgers are fantastic as is the steak sandwich. The adult grilled cheese is amazing. The hand cut fries are outstanding as are the onion rings. The barbecue sauce is the best around. The bartenders, staff, and new owner Dave are all excellent. I could go on and on but it's making me hungry!!"}
{"text":"Came here and didn't realize it wasn't Pacers anymore.  New sign went up the day we went.  Had my heart set on some good ribs and ordered them anyhow.  Was not disappointed.  They were the meatiest ribs I have had in a long time.  Dining partners ordered the Poor Man's Surf and Turf.  Their steak was very good and the shrimp were ample sized.  Owner waited on us.  He was very friendly and willing to talk about his plans for the restaurant.  Will go back again, need to try the hamburgers next time.  Was not disappointed in any way."}
{"text":"Change in owners, but still great bar staff. Burgers have gone up a notch. Can't wait for summer patio"}
{"text":"So a very nice guy whose name I can't remember, he came around introducing himself at the bar, bought the Pacer's place and made some much liked upgrades and kept the favorites. The inside looks almost the same. I love the bar here and the TVs. It's a great place to catch a game. The outdoor patio is nice as well.   The appreciated upgrades are the fries are now fresh cuts again and larger portions. They're now served with cheese sauce and what tastes like a homemade ranch. They were delicious for $5 and went well with a whiskey on the rocks for $6. They also now make all their burgers 1/2lb handmade patties fresh daily. Can't wait to try one. They kept the same delicious pizza crust. It's always a favorite of mine here. The same friendly familiar faces were behind the bar.   I feel with the new management and the positive changes,this new place should be a success! Check it out"}
{"text":"I visited Mean Mugs with a group of 10 for trivia night. The server handled the large table well. The food here is traditional American bar food - burgers, wings, sanwiches and the like. The portions are big, the prices are reasonable, and I was overall very happy with the experience.   I ordered the basket of onion rings appetizer, which was a true basket - probably in the 18-20 ring range, with a nice \"blooming onion\" dipping sauce. They were hot and crunchy, with a mildly beer flavored coating.  For my meal I ordered the cod sandwich, which was served on a garlic bread baguette with lettuce, tomato, and tartar sauce (which I had them remove as I'm not a fan). It was served with a pile of tasty fresh-cut fries. The sandwich was huge - nearly a full sub size. The fish was a bit heavy on the beer batter, but tasty and hot. I would order it again.  Definitely check in on the YELP app and get your free fried Oreos!"}
{"text":"Terrific service and awesome food.  The kids loved the games (connect four and rock em sock em) and asked to come back.  The owner came to our table and was very cordial and nice!"}
{"text":"In town for the weekend and found on Yelp.  We had a group of 7 all of whom really enjoyed lunch.  Burgers and fried Oreos were a hit."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for dinner and we really enjoyed the food, service and drinks. I'm a vegetarian and had a question about their veggie patty. The owner came out and talked to us. He was really nice and really wanted to make sure we had our questions answered. I was impressed on how accommodating he was to us.   I ordered the veggie pattern and got the 'Big Boy' version. It was REALLY good. I liked it. There was also a veggie wrap that looked good that I may try next time. My hubby got a chicken quesadilla that he thought was good. The drink and food specials were good. They had $2 drafts so I got a Blue Moon. It hit the spot while we sat on the patio.   Overall, this spot is great. I loved how friendly and helpful they were and the food is good. I'm happy Mentor finally has a local owned business that isn't a chain with good food. We will be back."}
{"text":"Late night bite alert. Good food, great service! This restaurant proudly serves solid, above-standard American bar fare. No airs, not a hole-in the wall, just good burgers, yummy unbreaded wings* and ribs in a very nice local bar. Shout out to your on point baordwalk fries, Mean Mugs!   Food is 3.5 (quite good!), drink specials are awesome, and Service is excellent.  Mean Mugs has a well kept interior with plenty of flat screens to enjoy watching sports over a plate of good food and *very well-priced drink specials. See menu.  Our server was Kirsten last night and she was really awesome- prompt, knowledgeable, with a friendly and relaxed disposition. She kept our drinks topped and ensured we had everything we needed during our meal.  We enjoyed dining Al fresco at a table near their outdoor bar, which was furnished with very comfortable patio furniture and parasols. I personally think that the evening air added to the ambience and I would recommend coming in after the sun sets if you're into lights strung up against the dark sky. This restaurant is situated right along a main avenue so an added benefit to dining during the evening is  a less busy road, but honestly, with good service and good company, and really comfy patio furniture you will almost forget you're next to mentor avenue :)  I know, you're thinking, Wow, you really dig their patio furniture... But yeah, especially after a tough winter, I love and extra appreciate everything about summer. Bring on patio dining! Bring on Malibu, Midori, Mojito, Margarita... everything summer. Thank you Mean Mugs, for keeping the lights on late! On a Tuesday! So come with friends, I promise it's a good idea. :)"}
{"text":"Got the mean mug burger. Didn't realize it was two grilled cheese sandwich buns weighing in for a seemingly 5lb burger I was pleasantly surprised with such great customer service from Aron. And would definitely come back again for another try. Unfortunately the burger beat the man, and couldn't finish it in one helping."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner on a Thursday. Very friendly waitress. Had a great burger and onion rings. My wife and daughter liked their food too. Liked the atmosphere too. (Board games a nice touch... we played connect four). Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Friendly, fast service. Accommodating. Surprisingly varied menu. Fresh, tasty food. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had lunch today at Mean Mugs. We were seated and our drinks were brought to us right away. Our server was also the bartender, but the didn't stop her from taking very good care of us. We started with loaded fries which had a good seasoning on them and a lot of cheese and bacon. I got the hangover burger and my daughter got the high steaks but were very good and more perfectly seasoned fries. We will return and my daughter wants to bring here husband as so as he comes home on leave."}
