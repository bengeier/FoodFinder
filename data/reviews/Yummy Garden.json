{"text":"My husband and I are both vegans, this has became a favorite spot of ours for thai food for the past year. They have great service and deliciously fresh food. We had today the mango salad, coconut soup, vegan fried rice. Fried tofu and green beans in black bean sauce. This place has exceptionally clean food. We will be returning! Thank you"}
{"text":"Kung pao chicken had a lot of flavor. The lunch special came with a spring roll and a salad.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. If you're an adventurous eater who is friends with someone who only likes \"safe\" Chinese food, this is the place for both of you. They have standard American Chinese and authentic Chinese, so you can both leave happy."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I have to say that the service is great and the food is tasty! My waitress even listened to my pronunciation of French fries in Chinese and applauded me on my accent, :)  The pricing is reasonable, the food is served hot and fresh, and the waitresses are always available for questions or to bring you more drinks. Also, the portion sizes are great! Try the vegetable lao mein, it's my favorite! :) great place to go!"}
{"text":"We noticed a new Chinese restaurant in a location that's been many things over the years. Initially we expected it to be another Chinese buffet but were pleasantly surprised when we walked in. Despite the unassuming drab exterior is the interior was nicely done. The decor is tasteful, and the seating new and clean.  We were greeted warmly and served promptly. The menu was pretty big and prices were reasonable. We had spring rolls and spicy szechuan won ton as appetizers, both were good, but be warned, the won ton were garlicky.   We had vegetable lo mein and Singapore mei fun as entrees. Both were very good, the mei fun was spicy and the curry was great, just the way I like it!  A good meal and good service, it looks like there's a good new sit down Chinese option in Kent. We're looking forward to trying more of the menu."}
{"text":"I am so glad to finally see a GOOD Chinese restaurant in Portage County. I have already been here 3 times since their opening and each time I have been happy. The egg rolls and wonton soup are simple and very flavorful. The egg roll dipping sauce is phenomenal!  It is SO refreshing to be served something other than that usual radioactive-looking red stuff...!  Singapore noodles and the house lo mein are my favorites and taste very fresh.  The fried rice was not the usual you get at most places; it was fresher and tasted more authentic.  I hope they don't give in to the pressure to Americanize their food!  Maybe the many Asian people eating there regularly will help them remain true to their mission."}
{"text":"A very nice Asian restaurant with beautiful dec√≤r in the plaza across from the Eglinton Square mall on Victoria Park Ave.  Tried the Thai Red Curry and Chicken Pakora.  Both items were very delicious and fresh!  Great restaurant to pop by at if you are craving great tasting asian food in the area!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times, and it is only average at best. The food is decent, the kind of food that you can get in any other Chinese restaurant. The price is a bit higher than what it is worth. It is a acceptable restaurant to fill your stomach, not so much for enjoying food."}
{"text":"Three of us tried this restaurant for dinner last night. We had Thai vegetable curry, Pad Thai and Cashew Nut Chicken. After we finished we all agreed that the food was delicious. The Thai curry was very authentic and was medium hot (spicy) but just right when eaten with steamed rice. The Pad Thai was served with ground peanut and a lemon slice (typical Thai style). We did not try the Malaysian items on the menu and will save that for our next visit. The prices seem reasonable and comparable to other Asian restaurants that I go to. I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Found this place thanks to yelp and the pervious reviews are completely accurate! We stuck mostly with Thai side of the menu and weren't disappointed. Highly recommend the garlic bok choy, the spicy basil noodles, fried rice and the chicken wings. Portions are generous, delivery was fast and we were surprised with free spring rolls (that were delicious)."}
{"text":"This is our go-to restaurant when we are looking to get takeout. The food portions are huge for a very cheap price. We can never finish all of it in one sitting, makes great leftover food. The food isn't too greasy as well which is a plus.  Some of our favourites are the Pad Thai, Thai Green Curry ( chicken), and the Oodles of Noodles Mee Goreng.  The staff there is friendly, the restaurant itself is clean and nicely decorated."}
{"text":"after the renovation months ago, i become a regular here...  food is always fresh and amazing...  one of my favorite dish is Chicken Pakora... really juicy and delicious with a hint of heat and full of aromatic spice, awesome!"}
{"text":"We stopped at yummy yummy for lunch and were blown away.  The food was excellent and the portions were decent.  We had 3 apps for lunch between the two of us and we were full.  I highly recommend the mango salad, and coconut chicken soup (pay the extra dollar to have both chicken and shrimp- worth it!) The satay chicken was a great sized portion but a little too salty for me.   The service was excellent the staff were very friendly. Lunch for 2 with soft drinks was less then $30.00.  All around a 5 star place for the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant purely by accident when driving around looking for something to eat. and were impressed! From a cursory call to make sure they were open and being greeted on the line by a friendly voice, to the welcoming faces of the staff... And amazing smell of spices and food...All was good!   Don't let the exterior location (strip mall ) phase you, this place is worth ordering from.    We ordered lamb curry, lemon chicken, chicken pakoras and fried wontons. Everything was amazing!  Portions are very generous and we had enough for left overs for the next day and it was just as good.   The sauce for the lemon chicken was really good and didn't have the awful amounts of cornstarch other places use   Definitely ordering from here again, would recommend!"}
{"text":"Waitress/owner was very nice, and portions are great. But that's as good as it gets here. If you want old, crunchy rice; ketchupy pad Thai; and weird tasting tap water that reminds you of washroom, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"First of all food is good! I'd give the place 5* as for take out place.  As a restaurant it might not look really attractive though ( to my taste). Well it's clean and spacious with some orient style decor but dunno what bothered me there may be floor tiles that remind me of soviet clinics. Anyways I'm sure I'll be a frequent visitor food is good, great selection ( I wish they had sushi too lol) and reasonable prices. And they give you a free egg roll for delivery orders and 10% off on take out if you pay cash."}
{"text":"I hate their staff members. I am a Chinese student and every single time I went there they would introduce me to believe in Christianity and they target every single other Chinese students. Keep your religion to yourself! Aside from that, they were pretty bad at picking out. Their Chinese food is authentic, but pretty, pretty, average. I ordered 4 dishes last time from them planning to eat for the weekend but I kept none. The fish was not fresh or at least over fried and the sauce/juicy or whatever you call it to spice up the beef was sticky (cold appetizer) and that was disguising. If it was hot dish I wouldn't complain much. I just called them and hung up because I refuse to give them any more of my money now. Why cannot they even remember the street address of mine? I am a student on campus and they should keep in mind of where we live or it means that nobody in the school like their so they barely got order. \"575 Senhauser Drive.\" \"Spell it.\" \"What?\" \"I said spell it.\"  The waitress who picked the phone call was not friendly and talked in a lower, frustrated tone, so I told them that I changed me mind and hung up immediately. I am not looking for bad attitude, or, and food.  Next week, I am going to take the one-and-almost-a-half-hour bus drive to Downtown Cleveland, and then take uber to Asian town. I am there for Han Chinese Kabob and they are much better!!!  They earned their loyal customer by great effort and don't you think I want to support local businesses. I tried.  The two star is just for grace."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! The service is so great! Staff are very nice. And it's pretty efficient as well. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I recently visited this Chinese restaurant for couple times. The beef noodles they provided are extremely good so that I think you should give them a shoot. No matter you like spicy or not, the chef will give you a different feeling about a bowl of traditional Szechuan style noodles."}
{"text":"Found a fantastic little resturant that makes Thai, Malaysian, Indian Hakka and Chinese cuisine! Nothing great to look at from the outside but the food quality, flavour, texture and price is fantastic! Would definitely recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this (I really did) BUT the chicken in my coconut soup was spongy and the pad Thai looked boring. They do have a crispy delicious spring roll and calamari is decent but the chicken really grossed me out and ruined my whole meal. Ewwww now I thinking about it again :("}
{"text":"Well after finding no Chinese delivery for brimfield Kent area they were only one I found for an added fee, prices seem higher then most lunch combo delivery seemed to be small portions but everything is excellent got szechuan chicken, sweet and sour chicken, orange chicken, wonton soup, crab Rangoon, all delicious flavors, definitely will get again, maybe try eating in next time :-) 5 stars if prices were lower! Best Chinese food I've ever had!!!"}
{"text":"I've come here on three separate occasions now, and I must say that this place has come a long way since they first opened.   The food gets better and better every time I come here. Hot, fresh, big portions and relatively cheap as well. Highly recommend avoiding the typical Chinese go-to orders such as General Tso chicken or Beef and broccoli. If you really want to try the best food here; try the authentic Chinese cuisine on the menu."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best place to get Chinese in Kent. They offer authentic Chinese as well as your typical General Tso chicken. Portions are generous and the staff are extremely kind. I highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"You gotta give this place a try! Authentic Szecheuan deliciousness. Everyone loved their food and the staff was super friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"I don't understand why the young lady has to practice piano during dinner service. It's awkward. Food here is ok... a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"NOT SO YUMMY TO MY TUMMY!  We (party of six), decided that we wanted Chinese for lunch today so I consulted Yelp and this was the most convenient option.  The reviews were positive so we decided to give them a try.  We walked into a nice restaurant that was not very busy at 2pm.  It had a nice casual decor and great seating options for groups.  After receiving our beverages in a timely manner, we proceeded to order from the lunch menu.   Since I was in \"polite\" company today, I was not in Yelp mode which means I did not discuss the food nor did I take photos.  Under the circumstances, it simply would have been rude to do so.    I will simply address the food that I ordered  or sampled.  Let's start with the spring rolls:  While they were perfectly seasoned and delicious, they were cold in the center.  I have never had this happen before.  The chicken and vegetables were not a quality blend and therefore were substandard at best.    The rice had an odd (too soft texture).  The General's chicken was too heavily breaded and coated with sauce.  The chicken wings had an odd seasoning although they were ordered plain, without added seasoning.   Overall, the dishes were not made of quality ingredients.  It is just that simple.  However, what saves this review from being a one star review, is the great customer service we received.  Our beverages were delivered promptly and our waitress was very kind and polite during our visit. Yummy Garden simply needs to raise the bar and work on improving their dishes."}
{"text":"Wasn't the worst, wasn't the best. I ordered general tso's, crab rangoon, and the spring rolls. All the food was fresh and better quality than most places. The chicken and spring rolls we're pretty good just lacked a little flavor. But the crab rangoon just had very little to no flavor and I was disappointed. That's always my go to and just didn't really enjoy them here. Other than flavor, the food is quality and the inside is a nice little place to grab some original Chinese."}
{"text":"This restaurant recently opened so my partner and I gave it a try.  Pro....the place seems very clean of course is new.  The menu has a variety of Asian dishes.  We both ordered the basic lo main with wong tong.  The soup was extremely hot as was the lo mein.  Good.  We like our meals hot not warm as some Chinese eaterys. The manager took our orders.   The soup came out quick but dinners were abit slow for Chinese.   Not that bad as we were not in a hurry. We both felt the soup was very bland.   Kept adding salt and pepper to get flavor.   Was tasteless, we felt.  The lo mein dishes, both had the same issue....taste challenged.  Again had to try to spice up with soy provided.  The odd thing with soy was the table bottle was a refillable.    When we used, the soy ended on bottom of plate.  Seamed very thin and weak.  We will go back soon for another try.  If nothing has changed we will convey our dislike and not return"}
{"text":"Ordered some food to be delivered from this place during the GoT finale. I wasn't feeling like a lot of food so I just ordered the Tom Yum soup and the 6 piece chicken dumplings. My friends ordered the Pad Thai and a broccoli beef dish. I didn't try their dishes out. But I found the soup to be okay. Nothing wrong with it per se, but nothing to rave about. I didn't really enjoy the chicken in the soup and I wish there were more mushrooms but an okay soup. The dumplings I found to be too salty. I thought they would be more pan fried than they were. I wasn't a fan of the dumplings at all. The friend who ordered the Pad Thai was disappointed with her food as well. I guess that is to be expected as the place we went to for Pad Thai is no longer in business and it's been a real struggle finding a dish that comes close. The other friend who got the broccoli beef dish seemed to like her food. If I do end up trying this place again, I'll definitely order other dishes! Really glad they deliver though, since no one was planning on going out after the finale ended!!!"}
{"text":"It is very delicious. The chicken tastes real. I've had it twice now and they serve a nice amount of food. Its definitely worth the price"}
{"text":"Got my order delivered and it came super hot granted they are about 3kms away but I'm never disappointed with the service and delivery time.   -Chicken wings were on point and has that Chinese restaurant flavour.  - Pineapple fried rice which could have used more flavour and more pineapple.  -Beef chow mein crispy 2 thumbs up.  -General Tao chicken  was great.  -spring rolls were good and that sauce is delicious. -Great portions!   Sorry no pics this time as the food was crushed haha"}
{"text":"I visited last week and I enjoyed it.  I got spicy fish and also tasted the chicken green curry. Flavours were great, and the curry was spot on. Even the rice was well cooked! I also had the chicken pakoras and they were truly excellent--I'd definitely get the pakoras again. The quality of the meal was really good.  The meals came with a choice of side: the spring roll (yes, one roll) was average, and the wonton soup reminded me of chicken noodle soup, though the wontons themselves were good.  It's a family run place (as far as I could tell) and they were very attentive. It was empty on the late afternoon I visited, but I hope that's not the usual.  The prices were great, the food was great, and the service was great. I will eventually visit this restaurant again to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Very good Chinese cuisine. Best in the area. Thankfully it's not a buffet but rather a nice sit in restaurant. Friendly staff and quick service. Different style than P.F. Changs but more authentic. Highly recommend this place located in Kent, OH.  The Mongolian beef is awesome and the half duck is worth trying at least once. Love their lo mein."}
{"text":"I have been to Yummy Garden a few times and every single experience was wonderful. The service is some of the best out of any restaurant in the area. The employees are super nice and friendly. The food is delicious as well. I highly recommend trying it out if you're in the Kent area and craving Chinese food."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is just awful. Last time we were in there my wife and I had too leave as the waiting staff never came to take an order. The restaurant was not full either. We will try it one more time. Update: this was a long time ago. The service is excellent and the food is very authentic. They are my go-to Chinese restaurant. Very extensive menu."}
{"text":"This place is really great, the service is good too I usually get the crispy beef which is awesome and the basil chicken with fried rice. The rice is realllyyy good. Its affordable too esp. their lunch combos, those are totally worth it!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on Saturday and it was great food. The dry spicy fish and Manchurian chicken were brilliant!  They are reasonably priced and are located in an unassuming plaza in Scarborough."}
{"text":"I've only ever ordered takeout once & it was great. I'd give them 5 stars but it was a little  difficult to order the food because of the language barrier.   The food was great! We got the mixed veggies with a side order of rice, mango salad & vegan pad Thai. Nice big portions, food was very fresh! 5/5 on the food.   Delivery was fairly fast about 30 minutes. Delivery man was nice. Nothing exceptional but it was perfectly fine.   I will be ordering from here again. I can see why this place has such good reviews."}
{"text":"We thought we would try this place and ordered ASPARAGUS and BEEF and were served Scallions and BEEF and when we told them their mistake she said the girl is new and did NOT understand. So we asked for the Asparagus and Beef and she then said they are OUT OF ASPARAGUS ! The worst part is they still CHARGED US $15.95 even though the scallions and beef is MUCH CHEAPER! While it looks nice here....there is a reason the parking lot is EMPTY !"}
{"text":"Ohio has a lot of disappointing Chinese restaurants. This is by far the best authentic Chinese food I've had in years. The crab Rangoon and vegetable lo mein is amazing. I can't wait to try more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"The only Chinese restaurant that delivers in the area around Kent. Quality is fine, but it seems to me too expensive. I ordered cumin lamb ($17) and surprised with the size of the portion which was so small. Not sure I will order again from them."}
{"text":"I would say this is one of my favorite asian cuisine places to go to!   It was late at night, around 9:30 pm when I started craving for a General Tsao dish.  My boyfriend was really nice to drive her hangry girlfriend to this place at 10:30pm.   When we came in the restaurant, there was only the lady in the reception and the cook in the back room present.   I asked if we could eat there still because the store sign shows that they close at 11pm. The lady who had broken english welcomed us and accommodated us till we devoured everything in our plates.  We ordered General Tsao chicken and chicken fried rice. Our bill came up to $23 with 2 drinks.  The General Tsao was to die for! Sweet and a bit spicy, really filling! My boyfriend and I eat a lot, their serving was enough for us:) The rice was tasty too! It had a lot of flavour in it, you can eat it just by itself.  I'd recommend this place to anyone!  The only downside I had experienced with them was when we drove on a Sunday afternoon. The store sign said that they open at 1pm but we waited till 1:45pm and the store was still closed.  Excellent dishes, reasonable prices too!"}
{"text":"So the outside looks Uninviting, the inside is well appointed and clean and not greasy.  The menu is traditional schechuan.  I ordered the spicy dumpling  that were perfect.  The lamb dry pot was also good.  The green bean with ground pork needs a little more flavor.  But a very good addition to kent's dining scene"}
{"text":"In a VERY unassuming location and building, this is a gem. The service is fast, the food is exceptional and the prices are fair. The menu is extensive and invites the diner to explore beyond the typical offerings found in similar establishments. I don't eat here for the atmosphere. I eat here for the food."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE their spicy calimari!  This fried calimari comes in thick, linear sections instead of the thin, circular ones I'm used to.  They resemble the shape of a fritter and are mind blowing!  I'm not usually able to eat spicy food, but these aren't too hot and they pack a nice taste.  Once in a while, I get an odd craving for them that needs to be satisfied. I've also had the crispy beef that I ordered with a side of rice.  Very nicely done with loads of broccoli. I've also had the thai glass noodles with shrimp and squid.  This dish was quite bland for Thai food and lacked as much flavour.  Yet, the restaurant appears to be a blend of Thai and Chinese food so that's probably a contributing factor.  So if you're someone who likes seafood and doesn't like the overpowering sensation of spices - this dish might be for you.  Conversely, you could also order a meat dish and eat it with the noodles, which is what i did. They have a few booths and dining tables.  Surprisingly, it's never busy and I think that's why service is so good.  However, one thing to look out for is that there's an older waitress who works here who speaks very minimal English.  If you have questions, as we did, it might be a little hard to get answers.  Even so, we still got great food."}
{"text":"While the food is overpriced, it is not awful.  Husband ordered the seafood pot and I ordered their Shrimp Pad Thai.  Both were very flavorful and came out HOT!  You get a portion to fill you , but not enough to bring anything home.  Just fine with me.  We went during lunch and was greeted promptly and sat quickly.  The service was excellent and the wait staff very friendly and attentive.  I never had to ask for refills on my drink.  They have a small Asian market in the back that I partake of to restock my most used stock on occasion."}
{"text":"My family went here to celebrate my brothers masters graduation. We had a large party but they were very accommodating. The staff was very friendly and I believe the manager, Eric, was very professional. He went above amd beyond to make sure we were well taken care of, he even broke out some of his best jokes (not really lol) but it was the thought that counted. Now on to the food. As I stated earlier we had a very large party but when I tell you everyone was throughly satisfied, I mean everyone! Even my picky sister was able to leave a happy customer. Our orders ranged from General Tso Chicken, Orange Chicken to Shrimp Fried Rice and Mei Fun. My FAVORITE thing was the Pork Egg Roll. It was so good that I had to get another one for the road. Prices were songood that college student could eat like royalty! Will definitely be driving back to Kent just for this place!"}
{"text":"So glad to see another authentic Chinese restaurant opening in the Cleveland area!"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted authentic Chinese food and were very pleases with Yummy Garden! Huge selection,  very generous portions, and amazing taste! Staff was very friendly and courteous - also enjoyed the young lady playing the piano! She is very talented!"}
