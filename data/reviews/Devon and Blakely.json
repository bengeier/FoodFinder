{"text":"I ordered the Prosciutto and Arugula sandwich. VERY SALTY. It's like someone chose the saltiest food items and put it in a sandwich. Olive spread? Salty. Parmesan? Salty. Prosciutto? Definitely salty. They need to balance it out. Had to scrape the olive spread and take out the Parmesan just to enjoy it a little better."}
{"text":"Good breakfast prices. The breakfast platter is a good deal. Would be nice if they recycled.  The salads add up quick so watch what you add."}
{"text":"As a transplant to Charlotte I was thrilled to see this nyc chain arrive where my office is @boa plaza.   With a reputation for quality and consistency my frequent visits have not disappointed.   The menu has 18 rotating soups to choose from (my favorite is the vegetarian lentil), gourmet sandwiches, and a very large, fresh selection at the salad bar, the dressings offered are very high quality and diverse.   I did waffle on the last  star though...... sometimes the lines are long, BUT in all fairness they do move quickly.   The service is always very efficient and polite."}
{"text":"So happy to have this NYC restaurant now in Charlotte. I went three times this past week alone! The salad options are by far the best in Charlotte for variety and quality (granted that was a low bar but this place immediately raises it multiple levels). The sandwiches are excellent as well. I haven't had any of the soups at this location yet but recall them always being excellent in New York. Thanks for bringing a bit of NYC to the QC!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place and come here frequently on lunch breaks with colleagues. Amazing soup selection, endless salad bar toppings, and great sandwiches and sides to choose from. I would give five stars if it weren't for the sad things I have witnessed on my last few visits. The employees are so nice and helpful to customers, and keep the long lines moving (it can get pretty slammed at noon). There is one manager that works there who unfortunately treats them terribly, and not only does she treat them horribly right in front of the customers....but the last 2 times I visited, she treated me horribly as well (she did catch herself last time as if she realized that I was in fact a customer not an employee....)  I am only now writing this review because I have seen this happen multiple times now..so 'this person just having a bad day' can be ruled out. Hoping something can be done about this because I have nothing but fantastic things to say about all of the employees, including the 2 men who seem to also be in a managerial role. It makes people uncomfortable to see others be treated that way and really does deter me from wanting to return."}
{"text":"This place is always busy during lunch since it's in the heart of uptown. My first visit I ordered the chicken and wild rice soup... I did not like it and would have much rather gone to Panera bread. Theirs was too sweet and I got so sick afterwards. Today I ordered the prosciutto sandwich and it was way to salty. I had to scrape off the olive spread and I still couldn't finish it. It left the top of my mouth feeling raw."}
{"text":"Great grab and go made to order salads and sandwiches. It is s nice addition to the Uptown Charlotte lunch scene."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick meal. They have sandwiches and salads. I had the smoked turkey and ham and it was really good. I'll definitely go back."}
