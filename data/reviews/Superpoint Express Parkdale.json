{"text":"Slice options have been disappointing, sometimes only pepperoni available, and tends to just sit atop oven drying out until you pay $5 for a piece of flavourless cardboard - could get same from pizza pizza chain across the street =/"}
{"text":"Pretty proud of this FTR. Goin way back with getting some FTR love. First to review, first in line and last to leave this place because Toronto's lack of solid, foldable NY style pizza is a travesty to this good town.   And then they busted out a wall to create a full stocked bar for a drink while you wait for take out, or full dine and late bar hours.   I take my daughter here after school for tiny pizza parties and I take my wife here for late night hangs.   Half price bottles of wine, solid cold cuts too, recommend the classic pepperoni, and their Caesar salad has potato sticks on it, word.   Maybe I'm just charmed as this place was plopped right smack in the middle of our neighbourhood but I don't know of another spot like this in Toronto. Doin the old Roti Lady location justice.   Best review ever."}
{"text":"I've honestly never had someone be so rude to me just for calling and trying to order food. This was going to be my first time ordering from Superpoint, my friends and I were really excited to try it out!  To start with, I tried to order through their online system which timed out because no one at the restaurant picked up my order, so I was directed to call them to place my order instead. No big deal, right? Here's how that went:  \"Hi! I'd like to order for pickup, please.\"  \"You mean take out?\"  \"Umm, sure!\"  \"What do you want?\"  \"Can I have a large Hawaiian pizza?\"  \"Dude, I told you NO LARGE PIES.\" (This was news to me, and I guess maybe large pies did something very bad to him earlier in his life because he was very offended.)  \"Ok? I'm very sorry. Can I have a regular Hawaiian pizza and a regular Pepperoni, then?\"  \"One regular Hawaiian, got it. Bye.\"  \"Actually I also asked for a regular pepperoni\"  \"Fine, bye\"  \"Hey sorry I'm actually still ordering.\"  \"Ok dude WHAT do you want?\"  \"I'd also like to get an order of olives\"  \"What? No, we're out of olives.\"  \"Oh, no problem. Can I get the cold cut combo?\"  \"The what? What are you talking about?\"  \"Cold cut combo? The cured meats? It's on your website.\"  (Guy is audibly super pissed off at me at this point, I guess some delicious meats did something terrible to his family in a previous life. Sorry man!)  \"Dude what are you talking about THIS IS PARKDALE\"  \"Ok man you don't have to get angry, just trying to order food\"  And then he hung up on me, clearly overwhelmed by flashbacks of food-related trauma.  Needless to say, this place will never get my business. I can't base my rating on the quality of their food since the angry pizza gatekeeper at this location wouldn't let me try a pie, regardless of size."}
{"text":"I love their Ossington shoppe, so I was super excited when Superpoint opened their bar slash take out location here in perfect Parkdale.   Most memorably, I came in here with some buddies for some celebratory wine, pizza and fernet. Their $5 slices are great, but snuggling up and tucking into a full pie is where it's at when it comes to Superpoint's saucy servings.   Best review ever."}
{"text":"Superpoint Express is located at Dunn/Queen St. W. This small eatery is open for lunch and I believe they serve alcohol  at night. I came by for lunch on a Thursday. Slices are $5 each and for the portion, $5 is a pretty cheap deal. I ordered a slice of pepperoni and ate inside the shop. The pizza itself was great - definitely not the worst, but definitely better than chain pizza restaurants and other places along Queen W. I really liked the cheese they used on the pepperoni pizza, really flavourful.   Service was friendly and although Superpoint is quiet during lunch hours, I can see how it is popular at night. Overall, good and cheap pizza."}
