{"text":"My husband and I are instant fans.  We were seated promptly upon arrival.  The restaurant is casual with a cool vibe, open ceiling with a big overhead open garage door.  Great service (thank you, Cody) and conversation with the owner.  We like to try different local restaurants and were pleased with the varied menu.  I am a \"meat & potatoes\" girl so I ordered their Eggs Benedict with hash browns.  This most definitely did NOT disappoint.  Extremely well prepared.  My husband had a Bloody Mary (with a strip of bacon) and Stacked Enchiladas with black beans, blue corn, and carnitas.  He ate every morsel.  There is seating here both indoors and outdoors on the patio.  The owner is interested in displaying the works of good local artists.  Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Music too loud. Especially with the TVs going and all the patrons talking. High ceilings and no carpet does not help. 3 of us had different salads and we would not order them again. My Asian salad was tasteless, the buffalo chicken salads (one fried, one grilled) too spicy to finish. Took too long to pay our bill.  Asked another wait staff member to please give our bills to our waiter.  Sorry, but we tried. This is advertised as a breakfast AND lunch place :)"}
{"text":"My first visit to What's Crackin and I shall return.  This was for a Saturday morning breakfast and I ordered the Eggs Benedict.  Good choice. My first impression is the place is for casual dining with a really friendly wait staff.  I felt welcomed and like a long term patron on my first visit. You can tell the staff like working here and that bodes well for the food being prepared. I shall return and try a lunch/dinner in the near future. With the garage style doors opened this relatively small place will turn into a large place.  Looks like fun."}
{"text":"This new place is such a great cafe!! Everything is so fresh and exciting to try. You really get quality food for the price that isn't expensive. Such a great neighborhood gathering spot!!"}
{"text":"First time today eating breakfast today and great food and prices! Will return and try lunch and dinner. Great patio also!"}
{"text":"Nice breakfast joint. My family took a look at the menu and decided to try this new restaurant out because of the gluten free offerings. However just having gluten free on the menu isn't going to help us GF people. The gluten free pancakes came out after our entire table of 6 already was done eating. There was no pure maple syrup/gluten free syrup offered. Also the syrup offered was just the same syrup container given to people who use it with regular pancakes. I'm not sure as a gluten free allergy person I would feel comfortable dining her again until They get the kinks worked out. The waitress wasn't even able to answer a simple question if the pancakes were made on the same spot as the regular pancakes. She said she would ask after we ordered someone and never came back with the answer. Also asked about GF toaster. We were welcomed and seated quickly, my family enjoyed all the other food that wasn't gluten free, which is why I gave this 4 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I had the homemade country fried steak with hash browns and toast. It was delicious, only slight problem was the breading came right off after a few minutes but it was still delicious."}
{"text":"I love trying new places, and I'm one of those people that never complains or sends my food back. Now, I really was rooting for this place, I wanted to like it so bad. But I had probably the worst experience I've had in a very long time. We sat inside at first, for about five minutes without anybody introducing themselves or at least taking our drink order or anything, even though our seat was right next to the kitchen where everybody was coming in and out. Finally, the only good part, was this young kid Cody. He walked by said he'd seen us sitting there awhile and noticed nobody had talked to us. He asked for our drink orders, was very nice, and we asked to move outside because we were right next to the kitchen doors and it was kind of cramped in there. Anyways, he took us outside, it was kind of full so we had to sit at a picnic table in the very back of the outside. That in itself is fine with me, there really wasn't any other tables. He got our drink orders, then as he was getting our drinks the waitress finally introduced herself briefly. He came back with the drinks, shot the shit for a minute with us, which is a good thing, and things were looking good. Then our waitress comes back and takes our order and I also order a mimosa which I ask her to keep coming with anytime I'm low. Had about a 45 minute wait until the food got there, with empty drinks and I had to ask the food server to get me another drink. My girlfriend asked for an over easy egg, it came scrambled with a strange taste to it and half of her French toast was undercooked. The menu itself was very confusing so I just got a breakfast burrito with chorizo added (which was almost four dollars extra). The next time she came around after we got our food she didn't ask how our food was and never once did the entire time even though half of both of our plates were uneaten. That is possibly the first time a waitress or waiter has never asked how the food was. The burrito, honestly, I got a chorizo and egg burrito from circle k on a whim before work and it tasted about the same. Overall, one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. Maybe if we had a better waitress our experience would've been different, but that, mixed with the sub par food, long waits, and pretty expensive for not good food or service, made it just absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our breakfast. Biscuits and gravy was delish!  From scratch!  My son's Denver omelette was fluffy and plentiful, he couldn't even finish it. His side of fruit was fresh and bright. My home fries were crisp and had bites of red bell pepper. The venue was sunny with a warehouse flare. Fun art on the wall. The service was the best I've had in a while. Servers and managers came by often, but were not invasive. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"First time at the new cafe in my neighborhood  (within half a mile from my doorstep ) and sadly I was a little disappointed :-( We were sat down and advised things might take a little longer than other places as it was all made from scratch. This got me excited as I saw they served corned beef hash, my favorite! So we ordered up and waited. The wait wasn't long at all! But sadly what arrived was dissapointing. $11 for 2 small eggs, a little hash, and non buttered toast. The hash was home made and really good, there just wasn't much of it. We might be back as the table next to us seemed to have a lot of really good looking food. (I added the picture of the hash)"}
{"text":"Our first time. Somewhat tight on seating inside which made me want to watch my 4 year old closely to make sure she didn't annoy people around us. However, the staff interacted with her and made the anxiety of being in close quarters rapidly disappear. The service was prompt and friendly with multiple staff stopping by to check on us for refills or to clear empty cups/plates. Our server was really great in explaining the menu and that theirs is a scratch-kitchen so the food may take a few longer that most would expect, ours seemed to show up with little delay. The food was fantastic, the pancakes were big, fluffy and the country sausage gravy was great. I can understand some people's comments about price but if you want Denny's or iHop's  prices then go to Denny's and iHop (and there is nothing wrong with that they both are great in their own respects), but understand that a local, small business that is providing great food and service deserves a whole lotta love for opening their doors in your neighborhood. I look forward to my next visit and trying a few more menu items."}
{"text":"Varied menu, great mimosas!  The Monte Cristo sandwich is deep fried, I personally did not enjoy it.  Outdoor seating with misters.  Edit:  Everyone 'loves' the Monte Cristo?  Apparently not Louis."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! Came here with my mom at around 1pm on Saturday. It wasn't too crowded because I think the lunch crowd had died down. First, most importantly, the drinks are so cheap it's amazing!!!! Who doesn't love a mimosa that's only $2?! We both ordered a club type sandwich with side salads. Big portions and was made really well. One of the best clubs I've had, even. Great presentation, kind people work here"}
{"text":"Ordered the Bloody Mary it came with bacon outstanding what more can you ask for! Large selection of food glad we came will be back."}
{"text":"This café has been open for only a few months and seems to be a work in progress.  I have now visited twice.  Both times we brought friends from out of town.  John, who I think is one of the business partners. was very receptive to our comments on where we thought they could improve. Pros - The food is delicious and for the most part the serving size was good.   The servers are all friendly and accommodating. The menu is flexible. e.g. The first time I ordered a short stack (2) of pancakes and the pancakes were the size of a dinner plate so the second time I asked if I could order 1 pancake and they said OK. Parking is good.   Handicapped accessible I ordered the Praline Pecan Pancakes.  They were huge and delicious. My husband ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and it was a huge serving and was \"real\" steak and was excellent. Loved the patio dining.  Cons - Both times service was very slow.  I appreciate that food is made from scratch, but don't go there if you're in a hurry.   Music was very loud.  It may have been OK for a Saturday night, but not for an 8 a.m. breakfast.  They did turn it down when I asked them to.  Menu is somewhat confusing.  e.g. On the Choose 2 breakfast my husband chose ham and eggs and sourdough toast and that's exactly what he got - Hashbrowns were extra.   Both times our friends (men) ordered the \"Country Bowl\" and both times they were still hungry and were not happy with their food.    The pros outweigh the cons and we will be going back. I had photo's of the food but can't figure out how to post them.????"}
{"text":"This place is just meh for me.   Was the food good, yes. Then again, you really can't mess up breakfast. It was sad to see that they didn't have the \"standards\" omelette (you know, Denver, Meat, Veggie, something that made them stand out) available but would need to pay extra for each. But never fear, I didn't take the omelette, it would have costed $16 for me. Instead, I had the breakfast burrito. While it was still a good burrito it just wasn't the best one that I've ever had. But if you're looking for good food then this will do the job.  As for drinks, I think that is why most people come. While I didn't partake it seemed the main seller was the drinks.   What about the prices? A little higher than what I would I felt it should have been. Hence, why I didn't get the omelette. But for the price, I feel that you should have received more but was sad when my plate came out with just the burrito. Yes, it does come with beans that I had them place in my burrito but it was lacking something still.   The ambiance was fine. Industrial look to it but nothing to take in the sounds, so it made it louder than it should have been. The music was classic rock. The team looked happy. The setting was snug and while I get you should get as many people in, I felt more frustrated for the staff. The rows are just tiny and it seems like everyone was up on the other person (which I don't mean in a good way, it's morning time and morning breath) even the tables felt that way.   Will I be back to this? No. I hate to have to say it because I was super excited to see this place come up but overall just not a place for this gal."}
{"text":"Sorry, I have gone to Whats Crackin Café twice and both times I did not enjoy the food.  I believe they do a good job with the drinks.  The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"THE BEST BLOODY MARYS EVEEEERRRRRR! I am so glad that my boyfriend told me about this place and that we went in! I will be going back EVERY chance I get I am IN LOVE"}
{"text":"Great food both breakfast and dining.  Service solid and friendly. Will go back many more times in the future."}
{"text":"After an early morning trip to the vet, we had to find a breakfast place that would accept our pets. What's Crackin Café have a very nice pet friendly patio. Our waitress was very friendly and efficient, she turned on the misters immediately for us upon arrival. The $2 Mimosa was a great deal! I had the What's Crackin Breakfast with sausage patties, very good. My husband had the Country Boy Bowl. The gravy was very salty, so he said that next time he would try something different. Great address!"}
{"text":"First time to What's  Crackin. Seated right away, glad we picked outdoor seating. Nice and roomy. The cocktails are well priced and yummy. I ordered the Monte Cristo big portion  the fries are hand cut and were great. Will definitely go back. Service was good there was a gentleman worker or owner going to different tables to check on guests"}
{"text":"Amazing Monte Christo sandwich. The owner is amazing as well. They carry Pepsi products, which are gross, (even though they have Dr. Pepper). I can't eat savory food without a Diet Coke so I was bummed to find out they have pepsi.  When I told the owner this, he did not hesitate or blink and eye before saying he would be right back with a Diet Coke for me!  He ran next door and brought me a carafe of Diet Coke!  That was awesome. Now, had he not had the next door connection, I am not sure how the situation would have or could have been handled, but I am thrilled that the Diet Coke was avail and that he went and got it for me without hesitation.   The Monte Cristo is really good and the fries were amazing! My husband ordered a burrito which was very large and filling, my friends ordered buffalo chicken salad and a club, both really large and nice presentation.   Everyone else has margaritas which they seemed to enjoy, as they had two each.  We will definitely be back, especially when the weather cools off and we can sit on the patio. They have several tvs for watching the UFC fights or football games as well.  Very nice addition to our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Overall thought process behind the rating: Restaurant ambiance/decor: the way the restaurant is styled makes it look like it could be a new favorite! Easy going with cool aspects. Seating is a little too over crowded  Service: ABYSMAL Food: decent, but definitely overpriced for what you get.  Restaurant concept: As a customer, there was no clear cut theme. They serve crab wontons, burgers, pad Thai, and chilaquiles. The restaurant name is quirky and clever, I think it would help if plates were similarly named. Stick to a theme guys. There can still be variety within a category of foods.  Let me start off by saying that I've worked in a restaurant, and my fiancé has spent more than half his life working in one as well; so we're pretty empathetic to staffing issues or delays in the kitchen, but we too have our limits. We walk in on a Sunday (late) morning, put our names down. While we waited, I downloaded the app and signed up. Got our table within a decent time frame, got seated. A while later our server comes over to introduce herself. And then attends to a nearby table (normal)... then we don't see her again for a good half hour. Okay, I exaggerate. We saw her.. we saw her attend to 3 other tables around us, but never bothered to check in with us even though she attended a table right next to us. Literally a few steps away. I had to flag her down to take our drink order. It looked busy so I gave her the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately, that went away pretty quickly. We waited and were conversing, but as we noticed other tables getting food that got seated after us, we got annoyed. We had to go to the front and tell the owner, John, that we were ready to place our order. Our waiter came back a few minutes after that and apologized, but at that point I was aggravated.  She didn't return to our table again until we were getting our check. Guys we were there for over an hour and a half and our waiter only came to our table 3 times... we saw her go from the other tables to take orders and provide what appeared to be decent service. I guess we'll never know. Food was definitely average.  My fiancée and I like to try out different local restaurants and we were excited to try this one out. Unfortunately it was definitely below our expectations. Honestly, if you can help to train your waiters to be more mindful in their service, attitude, and presentation, it could have been a better experience. Separate the tables a little more, give servers and customers some space. With less customers to serve at once, maybe the cooking staff will be able to prepare better food and faster. With exclusivity people's interest will spike. And if the menu could be restructured to a concept, you guys could master unique dishes that are cohesive with your vision AND get customers coming back for those dishes instead of throwing things on a menu and hoping something stands out. (Just an opinion)"}
{"text":"This place is a great cafe. Every thing was great. From the coffee to the juice to the service was good. The food was amazing. My daughter had the mini stack pancakes, and they were so good I stole a few bites. My husband had the eggs benedict, and I had the chiliques (not spelled right I'm sure). The classic Mimosa was on special for $2, and was really good. I didn't order a Bloody Mary, but the table next to us did and it looked really good. It came with a thick slice of bacon, so it has to be good. I know we'll be back. The food was so good and the service was even better."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a cute feel and patio. I have been for dinner and breakfast. Dinner they forgot a side when listed on the menu. Breakfast I got the breakfast sandwich but asked to sub the ham with bacon which they did but we were charged an additional 3 dollars and also not offered a side. A little on the pricey side but it is a local place so we kept going. Trivia is fun but the announcer does favors tables of all girls over others."}
{"text":"Gotta give them props for a very good lunch. The Monte Christo is the Chef's signature dish and it was really that good. Wife ordered Beef sliders and they were mid rare ( my fav and I thought perfectly divine!) but she likes 'em well done like her mama made them ( i.e burnt) so they made here a new batch which surprisingly were really good too.Fries are outlandish and you should def get them. the Bloody Mary (hers) and Body Maria ( mine, yum) were very good with a slice of bacon, celery and couple nice olives. I personally wouldn't have minded one bit if they offered to make it spicier, but they were that good. Mason jars a nice touch! Breakfast all day and lunch as well so no complaints at all. In the end John ( front of the house and one of the owners) would not charge us for the sliders. I asked to pay for it as they are a new restaurant and I for one would like to see them open for a long time. Scratch made food is outstanding so I got my priorities. He said \"come on back next time\".  Bet your tuckas we will! Very reasonable priced and $2 mimosas all day  to boot. Do give them a shot and you will know why I rave on so!"}
{"text":"The one star is for our waitress who was at least gracious.   She was the only redeeming feature.  We were told it would be a 30 minute wait for a table but it was 40 minutes.  No idea how the food tastes because we left after waiting another hour and left (for eggs and pancakes...seriously). Our first and last visit."}
{"text":"Awesome! This place has the best breakfasts in the area. Plus a fun bar / day drinking feel. It shall be a regular stop for me!"}
{"text":"This place is an awesome!  Great food, the service here is definitely 5+! The waiter that helped us really took his time to explain the menu and what he recommended which is always awesome! The atmosphere here is really modern which is great. They have an indoor and outdoor bar which is terrific. If you come here you must order the disrespectfully big and delicious chimichaga!"}
{"text":"I have visited the restaurant 3 times and enjoyed each time. The quality is good. living in Mesa it is few and far between to find a good place to grab a bite. The staff has been friendly each time and will make this my breakfast spot when dining close to home."}
{"text":"Wonderfully new place (for us). Great breakfast value, nice drink selection and the staff is so nice. Food is super tasty and the music jams give the place some pep .   It's a clean place and parking is plenty. This may just be our new weekend ..  or weekday place when we just gotta get out for breakfast or lunch.  This place is hopping so you know they are doing stuff the right way."}
{"text":"Good food but way over priced. While this area needs more breakfast restaurants, paying over $20 per person for standard dishes is rediculous."}
{"text":"Always have a good meal or snack! Menu is diverse and not 'cafe' styles food. If you are vegan or GF...choices are offered. Great patio with yummy mimosas. Thanks for coming to our neighborhood area!"}
{"text":"Makes you wait 10 to 15 min for a table even though they had 2 tables open when we showed up and another 6 open up while we were waiting. Front staff not keeping a good eye on when tables opening up. But I cant just blame her because all the staff saw the tables open including the owner and no one said anything...After getting seated it took 30 min to get our food. The food was good but not worth the wait or the staffs issues.  Avoid this place like the plaque!"}
{"text":"This little cafe is a jewel, an absolute oasis in Mesa. Went for lunch and we were seated by the owner. We sat outside and it was peaceful, well shaded and quiet, although there were a lot of people seated inside. Our waitress was very friendly and very personable. She encouraged us to get the app for rewards. The menu was extensive, but on recommendation we had the Monte Cristo. My-oh-my, if you don't order another thing get that! I would highly recommend this cafe for breakfast, lunch or dinner. A must go!"}
{"text":"Went in a week or so ago, I'm very excited to have a new brunch spot nearby our home as it's my favorite meal!  Small place but very cute, once the weather isn't staggeringly hot and they are able to utilize the garage doors out to the patio it will create a ton of additional eating space. Our server was friendly and attentive, food came out in a reasonable amount of time. The food was pretty good, I had the Eggs Benedict and the eggs were overcooked, the yolks were completely solid which is a huge peeve of mine with benny's as the runny yolk is the best part!  All of the food at the other tables looked great, and although we were not drinking alcoholic beverages this day, I LOVE that they have a full bar and plan to take advantage of it someday soon. Overall I would totally suggest this restaurant to friends to give it a try!"}
{"text":"Great new restaurant. Exciting menu. Try the Monte Christo sandwich as its one of their most requested items. The have a full bar, happy hour specials and a wonderful outdoor patio!"}
{"text":"First time patron Crab cake eggs Benedict and a buffalo grilled chicken salad   Side of seasoned fries  Excellent food, service and atmosphere is cool"}
{"text":"The place has tables too close to each other, I would say less than a foot maybe 6\" between tables!  You can reach over the next table with your arm while at your table.    Service was awful.  Had to ask for refills a few times, she started taking my plate away while I had food on it and had to tell her I'm still eating.  She didn't ask if I was finished, just started taking it away - bad.    She did not smile the whole time.  She didn't seem to like her job and didn't seem happy to be there.    I've had better service at other breakfast places where they are happy to have you there, making conversation with you, not miserable servers that rub off to the customers that leave unhappy.  We will not return to this place.  There are many other breakfast cafes that are way better than this one."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Awesome music playing.  Owner was very friendly to stop and check in while we were eating. What more could you ask for.  Very highly recommend for breakfast.  Wife and I will definitely be back to try lunch soon."}
{"text":"Trying something new and should have stuck with our usual places. Quaint, but weird venue and too small. Biscuits and gravy...had a lot of gravy with good flavor but needed chunks of sausage or something more. Biscuits were big but nothing else special. 2 egg plate was greasy and hash browns were bland and too dry. Staff was friendly and we sat quickly.  Nice to try something new, but just ok."}
{"text":"I've had several breakfasts at What's Crackin. The food is great, the service is friendly and attentive, the music is cool and the price is right. Also, they have a smart selection of the craft beers on tap. The outside seating is chique."}
{"text":"We are new to Mesa, so we were scouting out breakfast places while we waited for What's Crackin' to finish up construction and open for business. It was worth the wait. We've been here three times, and NOT disappointed. They have a 'scratch kitchen' so everything takes a bit longer to cook up. Eggs are tasty, I believe they are organic. Bacon is cooked to order, not sitting around absorbing grease. Patty sausage is scratch made, spiced to perfection. $2 Mimosa and an assortment of original breakfast cocktails? Got 'em. French press coffee? Check. Scratch made biscuits with house made jam, just like Mom used to make? Yup. Kristin, our server, was prompt, checked back with us and made sure everything was served properly.  For a newly opened restaurant, we can't see what kinks they need to work out. We stopped looking for any other breakfast restaurants."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place so we stopped in early on Sunday for breakfast (kudos for being open on Easter). Quirky decor kind of sports bar meets industrial but very welcoming. Greeted with 'please seat yourself' so we took a center hightop table..not super busy and our orders were taken almost immediately-$2 mimosa (more Kudos) and ice cold water served up quickly. Food took a bit longer than it probably should have and was pricey but pretty good...that's where the kudos end.   Even though we were sitting right in the path of the server going in and out to patio and to other tables, no one ever stopped by again once the meals were delivered. We needed refills on the beverages and I would have happily ordered another drink but no one stopped to check on us. Sure there was a flurry of like five tables come in over a twenty minute period, but others were finished and leaving as well... apparently that was enough to put the server and bartender in the weeds.   So after chewing on the ice to wash down my eggs Benedict we sat another ten minutes with dirty dishes and empty glasses watching the guy bus empty tables but never look our way. I finally asked for the check and the bartender dropped it off apologetically.   Hmmmm really want to like this place but the lack of service killed it for us. For the price, I expected more than drop and run. Seems like an easy fix if they add a hostess to control the influx and help bus and refill drinks. Anyway maybe they were just running too thin on a holiday, so I might reconsider and see if service is better next time. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. The Monte Cristo is excellent. The breakfast bowls are also wonderful. The staff is quick and thoughtful. I take all of my out of town quests here.   Also, I am not a Bloody Mary person but my husband is and he loves them. So you might give those a try when you stop in."}
{"text":"We had Dinner here tonight and it was great! I highly recommend! We will come again when Mom does not want to Cook!!!"}
{"text":"Great place, good food and our waitress Dalys was awesome one of the best waitress' we have ever had! We will definitely be back!!  Food was a little expensive for what ya get but it was good."}
{"text":"We had out of town guests with us for the first time in mesa at this breakfast. Good food . Will come again!"}
{"text":"My wife and l made our first to the cafe for brunch Sunday. Not a place for a family breakfast, more a sports bar, l think. The biscuits and gravy were mediocre, as was rest of food. I ordered the country breakfast bowl, potatoes at bottom of bowl we're undercooked, dish comes with two scrambled eggs, l asked that my eggs be fried over easy. When l was served, l received one egg only."}
{"text":"Super great breakfast joint with friendly staff and amazing, mouthwatering food. I've been here a few times and haven't been disappointed. The quinoa bowl and panfried tamales are to die for. Go in and ask for Grant. Great service guaranteed!"}
{"text":"I left off a star because the music is too loud.   It's a shame, because I loved the food, but when one has to struggle to be heard ( and to hear ),  it lowers the overall experience.    I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Everything I've eaten here had been stellar. Scratch cooking. I think I've probably eaten half the menu! Service had always been great and efficient. Mimosas and bloody Mary's are must haves. The music is very cool... And I'm not a fan of music in restaurants! I don't get the \"hate\". I'm pretty sure it comes from a nearby breakfast joint. Pretty sure those one stars emanated from the employees there. I've been watching closely. Don't believe them. Come in and taste some great food and do some day drinking. Hehe"}
{"text":"Well, it's unfortunate, but I don't see this place making it. Tried for the first time today. Service was good, food was awful. I let the server know that the eggs Benedict was gross as it was covered in nasty powdered hollandaise sauce that flooded my plate. I had taken two bites. The hashbrowns were raw and greasy. Even after complaining, I was charged full price. Charging people for uneaten food (after complaining) is sure death for this little restaurant. What a shame. They'll have to do far better than this to keep the locals coming in. The trade traffic in the area certainly won't support them. There just isn't enough of it. Locals will make or break this business. These locals won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been twice now. Food has good flavor but both times I have had issues with the technicality of the kitchen; first time my chilaquiles had raw eggs whites on top and this last time 1/4 of my sirloin steak was raw when ordered as medium. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"An amazing little brunch/lunch spot and locally owned. The food is always amazing and very easy to create whatever you are in the mood for. PLUS they have a vegetarian and vegan menu consisting of food that is delicious and unlike most places. The price is very reasonable and all the staff members that I've had the pleasure of meeting are amazing. This place is definitely worth trying out. The buffalo cauliflower bites are particularly my absolute favorite to order!"}
{"text":"Hash brown casserole.  Enough said!   Guess not Yelp wants more.    Great patio,  roll up Doors for indoor out door feel.   Great mimosas and bloody Mary's.  No judgement.  Owner on site to ensure you love the place and leave happy.  Healthy choices.  And pancakes larger than your plate.   Just try it.  You'll love it."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try What's Crackin because of the limited breakfast spots in this area. Overall first impression of the restaurant was good, food looked yummy, place was clean and it had a cool, unique atmosphere. Our server was nice and did her best to make sure our dining experience was good. Here is what we didn't enjoy about What's Crackin-  1. We asked for water as we sat down and didn't receive them until we asked for them again at the end of our meal 2. I asked for another iced coffee and the server brought me a new coffee with the old ice in it and a cup of ice on the side... so what I had was coffee flavored water. It's not hard to get new ice.  3. I ordered an omelette and when I received the omelette an hour later (a new table had been sat, served,ate, and left before we got our food), the order was wrong. Thankfully the manager took it off our check. They made me a new one in under 5 min which was better.  4. We waited over 10 minutes to get our check.  Willing to give this place another try because it looks like it has potential however the service needs to improve."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and our experience was excellent.  I get why the prices are a bit pricey and somewhat of a wait..it's because the food are fresh, cooked to order and delicious.  We ordered the vegetables omelette and order 2 (sausage and scrambled eggs) with home fries.  My boyfriend kept raving how good the home fries were. My omelette had plenty of veggies and was cooked just right. The veggies weren't over cooked and soggy. We also ordered 2 short-stacked buttermilk pancakes..let me tell you, they were not short-stacked..hee hee.  They were big & fluffy yet moist and tasty (will make sure to order again on our next visit).  And let's not forget the $2 mimosa and $5 Bloody Mary.  I didn't order this time..but will definitely be trying them out next time.   Let's talk about the service.  We felt very welcomed and received excellent service. Our server was attentive and had a very positive vibe. We were greeted with smiles and had a couple of managers approached us asking how were doing.  The atmosphere was down to earth.  We liked the decor and mostly the tables :-)  we will definitely be returning and maybe try the lunch menu..but I do like the breakfast menu :-). Thank you for the hospitality, excellent meals and welcoming vibe.  See you next time!!!"}
{"text":"Well the food was really good. Our party consisted of 5 adults and 3 children. Starting with drinks, mimosas took quite awhile to get to the table. One ice water was accidentally spilled all on one of the adults. The meal was brought out in shifts - the 3 kids got theirs way before the adults. Once the adult meals were served, toast was missing from one and it too took quite some time to be brought out to the table. I thought the food was good. Finally total confusion with the bill. It was to be broken into two. Server tried twice to get it correct but finally the owner had to come and make it correct.   I probably will come back. Servers need a bit more practice and maybe with time they will get better."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Good atmosphere,  friendly staff, delicious food, and real good pricing! You wont be disappointed if you try this place out! Ill be spending football season here for sure!"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out after a friend told me about it. I love that they make your food to order and it comes out piping hot. Decided to have the Bloody Mary which was very good.  Service is prompt and the waitresses are very nice. Love the little chicken logo! I will definitely come back for breakfast here!"}
{"text":"Came here at 0730 and it wasn't overly busy at all. We were greeted with a friendly smile and the excellent service continued from there. All the staff we interacted with were awesome. The speed at which we got our orders was excellent. The food was on point! We had two county bowls and an omelette and they were all awesome. The berry smoothie was delicious and the bloody marys were awesome with their bacon. This is a badass breakfast and brunch place and we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"First timers!!! Great little breakfast spot worth a try. Why not the sign spinner on the side of the road is persistent.   Great customer service immediately entering the building with the hostesses. Jordan greeted us once we sat with mimosas offer that was to good to pass up. (Great upsell, wish all wait staff did this, especially mine) Great selection on menu. Not overwhelming and some uniqueness. Pancakes came out the size of my Jack Russel and very tasty. My country bowl was yummy. Would be even better with more gravy. My hubster got the classic chicken fried steak. Well, all was good until he attempted a bite. The hubby has a garbage gut and has eaten many or my attempted gourmet cuisines,  even when I won't. He wouldnt take one more bite of that steak. Was so gristled and nasty he couldn't do it. He proceeded to his home fries, no bueno. Listen I hate to knock this down because the server Jordan handled the issue so pleasantly and then the manager came over and did the same. We will be back for that reason. Bravo fellow small business you will do well and I look forward to sitting on your quaint little patio in the winter months."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place more than I did just by ascetics alone.  It is a small quaint venue - I had high expectations for the food and service.  It was MEH.  It was high priced for the food, I can cook breakfast better at home.  I'm not a big drinker, however my friends though the mimosas were delightful.  I wouldn't recommend making a special trip for this place...its more of a \"everything else is full with a long wait\" option."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings... As many of the other reviews have mentioned, this restaurant is packed into a really small space. That will be okay for the six months out of the year that you can sit outside, but it's a bit of a drag for the other half of the year.  Here are the good points: -Friendly servers -Pretty good food. I had the carnitas burrito, and thought that the meat, beans and tortilla were good quality. -They serve your soft drink/iced tea in a plastic cup. You can get a refill for the road and take it with you. Smart idea, clever marketing item too.  The not-so-great: -My burrito had big chunks of flavorless potato in it. It would be much better if the potatoes were smaller, with more seasoning, and crispier.  -Yeah, I'm kind of a picky princess, so I asked them to hold the pico in my burrito. But they didn't, which was disappointing. Maybe have the kitchen be mindful of special requests? (I didn't send it back. I'm sure they would have remade it, but I hate to have them throw out the old one and waste it.) -The cramped quarters really are a downside to the whole experience.  All in all, I would like to come back and try some other menu items."}
{"text":"Excellent traditional egg breakfast. Over medium eggs cooked to perfection and hash browns where crispy on the outside and tender in the middle. Staff was friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"I hate giving a middle of the road 3star review but I'm making an exception because I really want What's Crackin to make it! (Normally I'm afraid they would get a 2star review from me.) We are desperate in east Mesa for great food and a good vibe to go along with local beer selections. So, what's really true about the place?   - Excellent local beers on tap.  - Serviceable food, but not memorable  - Nice outdoor patio.  - Crowded interior with too many tables.   *I wish this place was open at night because we need better bar options in this area."}
{"text":"Cracked my tooth on a piece of metal in their chilaquiles.  Owner said it was from the packaging on the meat.   Owner promised to reimburse my dental bill but still hasn't 5 months later."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here this morning after hearing about it on our Next Door community group... we were met at the door and seated quickly, no wait time. The server was quick and efficient and got our order right with no problems. The food was really good and hot (I have a pet peeve of luke warm food). We both had the eggs benedict, my husband had the crabcakes on his and we both commented how good ours was..we are not day drinkers but like the option for when we have company come into town, who might want a bloody mary or a mimosa with their breakfast. Not overly fancy in food or decor but just a solid good place that I look forward to going to again. Next time I'll try their lunch items. I'm glad they're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Came here for my b-day and I love checking out new establishments in the area.  So no breakfast in bed instead my guys (husband & son) took me out.  The hostess told us a 15 min wait although there was no one waiting but all the tables were full but the outside (too hot) was available so we went straight to the bar area (small) BUT....Kristen and the other bartender were awesome and very friendly.  Order my \"birthday\" mimosa it's okay to drink at 10am right? Anyways, they have mimosa specials 2 bucks for Brut, 5 bucks for prosecco. Ok..let's move on- breakfast menu was cool and different.  I see the other reviews... why are they not serving the normal omelet?  I say...go down the street to another breakfast establishment if you want the norm....Right?  Anyhow we order the norm short stack pancakes and me French Toast..my fav.  It was all delicious with side order of bacon and hash browns.....for the boys...not me.  Everything was great.  We timed it just right says Kristen and the cool bartender because it was not too busy and got our food pretty quickly.  Anyhow, the skinny is this...they serve breakfast all day long-NICE! They do server dinner but only on Fri-Sun??? Check their website..not sure. The inside of the establishment is small. Once the weather is nice and we can sit outside the patio is a nice size...almost the same size as the inside.  They do has a misting system and umbrellas. They do have a happy hour menu and Kristen knows her beers!  Reading the other comments - we lucked out and got seated within 15 mins.  I think chatting up with Kristen and the other bartender made this whole dining experience awesome."}
{"text":"Uuuugh.  I went really intending to love it but I didn't .  We were seated promptly, the place is casual cool with open ceilings and a big garage door leasing to the outside patio. Lots of young servers.  Our waiter took our order promptly, brought my mimosa and waters in a reasonable period of time. Our orders - two orders of biscuits and gravy each with an egg on the side came to us in about 10 minutes. Not particularly hot and the gravy was really bland and didn't taste homemade.  Biscuits on the dry side.  Our waiter never picked up our dirty dishes but instead brought the check.  We paid and left with dirty dishes still on the table.  Check (with 10%) tip was 27.95. Way too expensive for what we had.  I might try them again -- but overall, not impressed."}
{"text":"Great breakfast/lunch place.  Fun decor, great service and the food is fantastic!  We live in the area and this will definitely be my go to for breakfast.  My wife will be so disappointed!"}
{"text":"I made a yelp account just to review this place, the cowboy bowl was seriously the best thing I've ever had! Everything was very well seasoned and the portions were perfect. The waitress was also incredibly sweet and provided excellent service!! 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"First time going here for my husband and I!  We normally go to Sunnyside and turned away today and wanted to try something new... and we are glad we did!  $2 mimosas, which were tasty and easy to drink and have another!  Then we both decided to have the tamale bowl on the Southwest section of their menu, and that was quite delicious and fully satisfying!  Will definitely go back to try out more of their scratch kitchen options! (:"}
{"text":"We came here from brunch on a sunday after reading some varied reviews on Yelp.    It is a smaller place, but they make the best out of the room they have.   The outside seating was nice on a hot day, and there are misters all around to cool you off.    They have a pretty varied menu from traditional breakfast, Burgers, Mexican food and salads.    They have a vegetarian and vegan menu; so you're pretty safe to bring anyone here and they can find something they like.    I see a restaurant who's trying to cater to a wide variety of tastes, which is nice.    The 2 Dollar mimosas were nice.    The Place is really clean and service was pretty friendly.   The food came out pretty quick.   The whole experience was *almost* great.    The food was pretty good, but it was uh....missing a little.  My wife and I are a sucker for a good Monte Cristo but they forgot the powdered sugar, which is that delicious sweet taste that make the savory really pop.  I really dig crispy hash browns (I think most people do) and mine were fairly under cooked.    The decor is kinda confused.  I like the TV's, The flags, and the Art, but it's got the feel of a business that doesn't know what it is trying to achieve, so its trying everything, with gusto.    Man, this place is almost there for me.   I really want to like it, but it didn't quite all add up.   Everyone can have a bad day, so I'd like to come back and try it again.    Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Fantastic addition to Las Sendas area.  Great breakfast and service.  Had the country bowl and biscuits.  Very reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"Some of these reviews are a shame. Signing up just to write a bad time? Well coming from an Elite, I completely disagree.   Decor: The place is on the smaller side inside, but I love how it is more intimate. Flags hang off the high ceilings, with some beautiful local art. Plenty of outdoor seating with misters.   Service: Not sure why there's so much hate. The entire restaurant was working hard, checking on customers. I loved the service. The owner even stopped by to say hello.  Food: First of all, yes there is a longer wait. Why? BECAUSE THE FOOD IS FRESH! Quit getting angry because your omelete isn't done in 5 minutes. The food was spot on compared to others in this area. They have mimosas and other drinks. I had the egg white omelete with sausage and it was seasoned quite well.  Overall: This place deserves much more credit than it has been shown. As someone who lives down the street, I will be returning. There's a rumor dinner service will be coming soon!!"}
{"text":"What a nice addition to the  neighborhood!  The decor is vey hi ceilings, lots of metal and music I couldn't hear.  Staff was very nice and knowledgable  of the menu.   I had  their Chilaquiles bowl, but it had way too many beans in it and not enough of the chilaquiles, plus the eggs were  over cooked.  The table also had the eggs benny, again eggs way over cooked and muffin had not been toasted, grilled or warmed.  Also had the sliders-yummy!  They are very new, like a week old, so we'll be back for another try or maybe for a drink off their awesome bar menu.  Nice menu to explore! Good luck guys!  2nd visit.  Crowded at noon.  Pretty good service and food was much better than first time.  The Monti Cristo was fabulous and hugh!"}
{"text":"Hmmm I think this place has potential. Right now I wasn't to impressed the food is ok not great the prices are a little high . I had quinoa bowl which I liked but my biscuit was not fresh super dry and crumbly . My Husband had eggs and hash browns he said were over cooked ! I think they are making a lot of efforts to improve and would maybe like to give it another shot in a few months if I'm in the area . My biggest thing is I think they are over priced for the quality of food you get ."}
{"text":"With other options close by we normally would have skipped this place but after looking at some of the other reviews we chose here instead of one of our usual haunts. This was the right choice for breakfast as everything was fantastic. The breakfast sandwich was huge and cooked just right, the omelet was delicious but if you want cheese don't forget to ask (I always thought all omelets came with cheese). We asked the waiter for some hot sauce and were informed that they had about 14 varieties, ask for the gun smoke as it was the best. The only drawback is price, although it is relatively the same as most independent restaurants so don't let it discourage you. I know I am willing to pay that price for it again."}
{"text":"A little pricey but excellent service and a wide variety of options on the menu. Lots of healthy and locally sourced food options, even a full bar if that's your thing. The peach mimosas are amazing!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here yesterday. The food was amazing!  It's nice to be able to get something other than breakfast foods as I personally don't like eggs. I ordered the rolled tacos off of the Tapas menu.  I was expecting 2, tapas is small plate in Spanish isn't it? They bring it out snd there are 4 huge rolled tacos. Crunchy on the outside, the carnitas were so tasty. My husband ordered the 3 real cheese mac & cheese as well as an oder of chicken strips. The mac & cheese looked very good with a nice bread crumb on top. It needed to be seasoned more, but was still good and a large bowl full. The chicken tenders were amazing!  I believe thete were 5 strips cooked perfectly.  I had to keep stealing bites.  My father in law had the Chef Angel's pan fried tamale. A wonderful green corn tamale flattened out and pan fried with home fries and jack cheese, fried egg and avocado, ranchero sauce, pico and sour cream. I had a bite and ahain just amazing. So excited to have a great place to eat early in the morning!"}
{"text":"This place is great and just what this area needed! There aren't many modern restaurants around but this is a fun and neat new spot. I had the southwest bowl and it was AMAZING and very filling. The drink specials are reasonably priced and I love the ambiance. The service was also very friendly. The only thing I would change is lowering the prices just a smidgen but that won't stop me from coming back and trying their breakfast and mimosas!"}
{"text":"Ok so im from out of town and I found this place just by luck, BOMB BOMB BOMB BOMB DIGGITY BOMB...  I had the Whats cracken breakfast with the ham steak..i was drooling at the mouth with one bite..perfection on my plate..try the sweet potatoe concoction it was AMAZING!! I cant forget about Melissa my server great service, loved the convo..keep up the great work. Ambiance was perfect, loved the Lil bar looking outside..yall have to stop here."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast this morning...  Super cute decor.  Sort of small on the inside but seemed to have a good size patio with misters.   We were told initially our wait would be 30 minutes, but it was less than 10.  While that is good for us, we did almost leave initially because we weren't sure we had time for a 1/2 hour wait.  Glad we waited!   I had the Monte Cristo which was FABULOUS with the upgraded side of the hash brown casserole. My husband had 2 sliders: fried chicken & the BBQ pork carnitas with Asian slaw.  Everything was delicious!!! The only weird thing was the pricing seemed odd.  My huge monte cristo that came with a side was $11 and husbands two small sliders that didn't come with a side was $10.    Everyone else's  food around us looked delicious too... and the lady across from us was excited to get the monte cristo I had on her next visit.  Definitely will come back and definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I'm always in search of good food; so, when I saw a sign for this place pop up on McDowell, I stopped in to give breakfast a shot.  Wise decision!  Friendly and down-to-earth staff.  Laid-back atmosphere.  Classic culinary delights cooked with elegance and tweaked with just enough creative inspiration for that \"wow\" factor.  I \"sampled\" the Monte Cristo, Hash-brown Casserole, and Buffalo Chicken Rolls.  Each dish blew my mind in a good way.  10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent spot for breakfast/brunch. We really enjoyed the atmosphere here. Busy busy place.   The drinks: All sorts of mimosas and even Michelada's which are rare to find on a menu anywhere! I had a cucumber mimosa and it was delicious.   The food: My son had a breakfast burrito and I had the crab egg Benedict. Mine was absolutely delicious and perfect! There was a good portion of lump crab and the hollandaise sauce was on point. I added avocado for .99  totaling $17 but was seriously worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Back at my favorite breakfast spot. Come say hi to John the owner and his team. Great service ! Great food ! Great time ! Sunday Fun Day ! $2.00 mimosas or a $5 dollar handmade Bloody Mary's served with bacon Yum!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was awesome.  The staff uber friendly. The food fresh and novel.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes new and novel cuisine."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite breakfast place! The staff is incredibly friendly and always remembers us. Smaller space yes but incredibly worth it! I get the pan fried breakfast tamales with the green chile and tomatillo sauce, it is the BEST! We try to stop in once a week for their breakfast as well as their really good and cheap mimosas and draft beer! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Took our family of six here for breakfast. Cool atmosphere. Polite wait staff. Two of our dishes were cold. Pancakes were good. Two kids ordered French toast - very small portions cost $10 each. In all, very overpriced IMO."}
{"text":"Small space with many many tables that people passing by bump into you. Went ones and never again. Music super loud and limited options. No a good place.  John- Options- my \"special\" order was a chai latte Flexibility- I was not able to get a substitute, my husband offer to pay extra for it. I cannot comment on the quality of the menu because we canceled the order; it was taking so long and the place is so small and crowded that I couldn't stay one more minute. Again, I do not recommend this place because our experience was bad."}
{"text":"We love this place and have been coming here since they opened. Breakfast food that rivals anything in the area, the staff and especially owners are great, love the service and how personable everyone is. Good beer, good liquor, good food, great vibe, great patio and dig the garage doors that open up the interior to the outside. Only reason I'm giving it four stars is cause of the bugers. They're not bad at all, but think they should be on par with the other excellent food."}
{"text":"One of THE best breakfast places I've been to and will be back. Everything scratch made. Recommend Monte Cristo sandwich with Melba sauce (raspberry preserves), pumpkin pancakes AND a very good Bloody Mary (has thick slices bacon strip, celery and olives). Friends said biscuits and gravy was good too, but little too much coarse cracked pepper. 6 of us got seated within 10 on Sun 11am."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and service. Accommodated a large group and service was timely. Strawberry pancakes were delicious. Large servings"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast! Their Monte Cristo was the absolute best! The place was hopping but worth the wait. Yummy mimosas and awesome Bloody Mary .... excellent and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great Bloody Mary's! Perfect brunch spot! Lots of outdoor seating and the staff is really attentive and caring!"}
{"text":"Came here with the family for breakfast. Husband had the monte cristo, which was amazing. The compote they served with it was so good! I had French toast (shared with our son) which was also very tasty. Didn't partake in their drink specials this time, but several people around us had the Bloody Mary which looked great. Everything here is made fresh, and the staff is very attentive. Great to finally get more good restaurants in the Las Sendas area!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere. Great service. The Monte cristo is amazing and the mac and cheese is worth it!!"}
{"text":"I live nearby, and nobody is talking about this place. The pictures that are posted, make Waffle House 5 stars.  But the deal breaker was the \"music\" not for me, I left.  Hint;  as a school teacher the younger generation has their own personal music.  I would accept an offer to actually try a meal, but I would like a refund if the food /service is bad. I visited their web page- no phone number to call for a carryout or call a manager to complain- am I missing something or is the Bianco pizza of PHX but it is now in Las Sendas?"}
{"text":"Go here for a delicious, quick, friendly experience. Mid-week lunch here with my wife and daughter was ideal. We were welcomed by the manager opening the door for us with a casual, \"Hey, What's Crackin'?\" The place was pretty busy, and there were only high tops available which was not conducive to us having a baby in a car seat. The manager rearranged some tables and brought out a car seat carrier.   The menu was diverse and interesting. We came for lunch, but the breakfast options looked amazing. I ordered the buffalo chicken salad. It came out as expected. The chicken was hot and spicy, tossed in a delicious buffalo sauce. My wife ordered a pretty basic turkey sandwich with a side of fries. The fries were really good, a little crispy with a sweetness to them. The sandwich was good; it was a basic turkey sandwich.   The service was great. We never had to ask for refills. Our check came promptly when requested. Everyone was very nice.   It is a local cafe/diner with good food and service. It lives up to what I believe it purports to be."}
{"text":"Crab cake eggs Benedict is to die for.  And the cinnamon roll pancake were yummy too. Cute atmosphere.  Great wait staff."}
{"text":"We hated it! Their eggs are mixed with sour cream, dense & awful texture!!! Pancakes were awful. Not a fan and will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Okay, let me provide some clarification, as I was asked to do. First off, let me say that I use Google to post my reviews as Im not so hip to the likes of Yelp, however, Ive been on it forever... and every now and then I like to laugh and see what other are up to.   Clarification: I thought this place sucked! The food was mediocre and the venue smaller than I expected. My server was terrible! I was sat in a corner where some sort of makeshift wine shelf was up against my right side. The man, some other customer, was so close to me and my party that he might as well have joined us and finished off my gross bowl thing I was served. I have had better breakfast food served at McD's.    This might be the place for you, but as I originally mentioned, its not for me. Will I ever go back, no! Its my choice and opinion, and thats what it is."}
{"text":"Found the best Monte Crisco sandwich in the East Valley!  The hash brown casserole was fantastic!  Fries were fresh and hand made. All fresh foods. I got to keep the drink tumbler. My mom had the same opinion. We really enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere with fun music and TVs throughout.  Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch. Food is fresh and tastes great. Bacon Bloody Mary is o e of the best I've had. Can't wait until it cools off so we can enjoy the patio."}
{"text":"Expensive, small portions, bad service. Nothing special on the menu, I guess most of the people were there to drink there breakfast."}
{"text":"Really fun place for breakfast. Service was really good and the atmosphere is nice. Definitely a fun place!!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place since it opened. My wife had eaten here and said it was really good. So I gambled and had them cater breakfast for a meeting. HOLY MOLY was I glad I gambled!! The food is fantastic. They were extremely flexible in the menu. The sausage gravy and home fries are phenomenal!! The food was delicious and they were super communicative through out the process. The food was delivered and set up in perfect timing by too early and not late. The ingredients were super high quality. The sliced cheese was actually cheddar cheese and not cheap sliced American cheese...I know it seems silly but if they are that concerned about the kid of cheese they send imagine how high quality the rest of the ingredients must have been. I was very very happy and so were the 40 people who attended the meeting. The value was incredible a few people said they were too full for lunch. Hats off to Craig and John you guys run a very efficient operation with a fantastic menu! I will definitely use you again. Now I just need to get my butt in there and really get adventurous on the menu."}
{"text":"First time here tonight.  As some have mentioned the place is a bit compact but there is additional outdoor seating.  The staff was great with several people beside the server checking to make sure every thing was going well. The chicken burrito was excellent. There is a wide selection of items on the menu to choose from so will try something different next visit.  It looks like it would be a great place for breakfast additionally."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong on the three star review. I would go back to this place if someone suggested it as a meeting place. The folks were very friendly and the food was pretty good. My son ordered the Monte Cristo and absolutely loved it. Two of us ordered standard breakfast fare and for the price, it just didn't seem like it was justified. We were hoping this could be a regular spot but the food vs. price ratio is just not where it needs to be. I think this place could be really good and it is clear that the management want folks to have the best experience.  Just for some reason certain elements felt lacking. Please don't let my review stop you from going there. Nothing but great service and a truly high desire to provide a great experience. No matter how I get my hair cut or how hard I work out I just won't be Brad Pitt."}
{"text":"Wow!  My wife and I were looking for a lunch place and stopped in. Small, with a nice patio. Several TV's and bar. Didn't think it would be our kind of place but thought we would try it. Saw people with a variety of meals from breakfast type to fried chicken!  All looked really good. I got a Classic Burger with fries. My wife got the the Southwest burger with pepper jack cheese, avocado, green Chile, and picante mayo. She got the macaroni salad. We cut both in half and shared. When I bit into mine I thought, \"I'm going to be sorry we shared, this is delicious!\"  The meat was so juicy and fresh and the right amount to go with the large bun. Then I took a bite of the Southwest burger, just as good in a different way. Best burgers we have had in a long time!  The fries were seasoned and delicious and my wife said that the macaroni salad was as good as she had ever eaten. Luckily, we live close so we can go back often to try the rest of the menu, including drinks, which looked awfully good!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Mesa. When my husband and I saw the sign for What's Crackin we were so excited. When we went we were not disappointed, and have been back several times since. This is a spot you need to check out.  Decor: I love the feel of What's Crackin. It is a small intimate restaurant which I love. They have lots of fun art work on the wall. They also have the garage style doors that open up to an outdoor patio. It has a very friendly feel to it.  Service: We have had nothing but amazing service when we have been there. They staff is always so nice and accommodating. We are always able to strike up some kind of conversation with the person waiting on us. They are good at checking on you, but not ignoring you and not making you feel smothered.  Food: The food is the best part. The breakfast is so good, and probably my favorite. They have a unique variety of food on their menu. It is not very often that I see a Monte Cristo sandwich on a menu. Their Monte Cristo sandwich was spot on. They also had some pan fried tamales that were in a breakfast bowl that were absolutely amazing. Lunch/dinner is also great. My favorite menu items on their lunch/dinner menu are the Mexican pizza and their hamburgers. They have some top notch food.  I am not sure why other reviewers felt the need to give What's Crackin one star....it is way better than that. I am excited for the next time I get to visit this lovely little gem."}
{"text":"This place has great potential! It's nice to see new restaurants opening in this area."}
{"text":"I can't believe some of these reviews. Nothing special?  I don't think so. They had a bunch of cool items I don't always see. Lots of Southwestern flair in the choices. Crab cake eggs benedict, chilaquilas,  monti cristo, lots of fresh ingredients. I couldn't decide between biscuits and gravy or eggs Benedict. Then my waiter told me about a chef special they had today. It ended up being biscuits topped with a sausage patty a tomato slice a poached egg and topped with country gravy.  It was the perfect marriage of my two favorite breakfasts!  I thought the service was fine. We were sat immediately. It did take a while for our food to come but it was busy and I felt like it was worth it. It has a man cave feel with how it's decorated. And when the weather gets cool and they can open up that big garage door and have that huge patio with misters it's gonna be amazing.  I'm excited to have a new breakfast place in the neighborhood. We needed one."}
{"text":"I'm only a visitor to Mesa, AZ but when I am I will frequent this place.  Great food but more importantly for me the customer service was above & beyond!  I went twice for breakfast & once for dinner & both meals were delicious;). Met one of the owners & he was a hoot so who wouldn't want to start the day with a laugh"}
{"text":"I am so happy that this place opened! It is my absolute favorite breakfast place, not only in the neighborhood, but it's the best breakfast place I've tried since moving to Arizona last year! The owners, waiters and waitresses and the friendliest employees I've ever come across while eating at a restaurant. The food is excellent and I always take my siblings here (who never finish their food) and they absolutely LOVE the chicken fingers and other kid's menu options. I will say that the wait is a little bit longer than other local breakfast places, but you understand why once you get the food to your table. Everything there is wonderfully fresh and the ingredients are of a certain quality that I have not had at other places in the area. The wait is completely understandable and does not at all deduct from a five star rating. Now the reason I REALLY enjoy coming here is that they have vegan options!!! The quinoa bowl is incredibly customizable and I order it different every time I come to eat here whether it's for breakfast, brunch, or lunch. If you had a bad experience here I highly recommend giving What's Crackin' another try and possibly letting the staff know about your past experience and I am sure they will make sure your returning visit is satisfactory. I have never been to a restaurant where the staff genuinely cares about their customers. I also feel like people are judging this place to quickly, it's a new restaurant everyone! They seem like they are working extremely hard to take into account the feedback of local customers to improve their restaurant. Two of the times I came here the owner came over at the end of my meal and asked me if I had any feedback for them. This restaurant is the epitome of excellent customer service, great food, cute decor, and a relaxed atmosphere. I will certainly be coming back soon for my fifth visit since they have opened."}
{"text":"The food was ok, music is very loud and if you are in a wheelchair or have someone with you in a wheelchair the interior is not very handicap friendly."}
{"text":"I just left this cafe for my first visit and would like to give a big thank you to the staff. My 1.1/2 year old decided he didn't want to sit and eat any longer, which at this age they always want their way. Our server was wonderful to get us a check and box quickly and even a bracelet for distraction, while he through a fit. Unfortunately I didn't get her name. Pink hair, super sweet.  There was a lot of staff on looking a little bored but probably just the time of day, when it slows down. Even with that, they were all friendly and staying busy. The lay out inside is a little small/tight tables but patio is huge and gorgeous. The garage windows open to the outside in two areas, very cool. Right now in heat, wouldn't recommend going during the rush time unless you want to sit outside. When it cools a little, this is the spot to enjoy AZ weather. Beautiful. Food would be the only reason i gave a 4 star. I got the country bowl I believe it was called. It had home fries, sausage, biscuit n gravy, scrambled eggs.  The sausage looked like a homemade patty which is awesome but was cold compared to the rest of the dish. The prices there are wonderful for the homemade quality of the food but I thought they could've put more potatoes to really make it wow you. Also got a fruit bowl with wonderful fresh strawberries, rasp, blackberry, and pineapple. Will definitely be back and I'm sure the food will only get better with time and feedback."}
{"text":"Good food with great choices! The Monte Cristo is great but gets soggy quickly. I think they need to let it rest longer on a paper towel. But flavor is all there!"}
{"text":"Must have been an off day for the kitchen and staff yesterday. The waitress was very friendly but brought out mayo instead of butter for the toast. Then cream cheese. 20 minutes and fresh slice of toast later, we got butter. The 1 egg I had scrambled was sweet (weird) and the bacon rubbery. Chicken fried steak was an odd textured coating, and the gravy was bland. Husbands over easy eggs were hard fried. Peanut butter pancakes are a favorite of my sons, but he said they were like eating wet cement. $50 and no one was satisfied or full. Might try again in a few months after they are well established, but currently wouldn't recommend. I seem to be the odd duck though, so like I said maybe it was just an \"off\" day.  EDIT: Wow! I left  my Yelp review and within minutes was contacted by John. Amazing response and much appreciated. Thank you. =) Will update after trying their food again sometime soon."}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed in the menu. It's quite pricey for what you get. Decent atmosphere and service great but menu is a stretch. Not planning a return anytime soon. Once might be the only time."}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time and was excited because there's not many breakfast places in the area. It took an hour for our food to arrive and when it did, the order was wrong. Took another 10 minutes to get our check back once we paid. Very disappointing but willing to give it one more try since we are still desperate for breakfast spots in the area. They have a lot of potential but bar rescue needs to rip the service a new one."}
{"text":"3 of us stopped in for brunch today to take advantage of the $2 mimosas and $5 bloody Mary. We didn't wait long for a table on the patio. We were given 2 lunch and 1 breakfast menu when we asked for more of each we ended up with 4 lunch and 2 breakfast.   2 of us ordered bloody marys, for $5 it comes served in mason jar with celery, olives, and slice of crispy bacon. However something tasted off so I switched to mimosas which had a good champagne to o.j. mix.  It took at least 30 mins to get our food, even though we weren't in a rush we were starving! I Can see this being an issues when the season picks up and needing to turn tables. I got the country bowl which was pretty good. It's biscuit and gravy with eggs and potatoes. The biscuit is huge and flakey however just needed a little more gravy and would have liked a little more potatoes. Gf got the tamale and she loved it, I took a bite and enjoyed it as well. My daughter got the French toast and it was soggy and she did not like it.   The manager was super attentive and appreciated that he was keeping an eye out on things.  I think there a few more kinks to work out but on the right track and we will be back"}
