{"text":"We were so excited to see that this restaurant had finally opened.  After trying several Korean restaurants around town, we were really hoping for some good Korean food.  We came in late but they were very attentive and friendly.  We ordered fried dumplings, beef bulgogi, and spicy pork bulgogi.  They came with the usual sides (cucumber and cabbage kimchi, daikon soup, bean sprouts, etc.)  Everything was absolutely delicious! My hubby said it was the best kimchi he's had since he was in Korea.  We were so stuffed when we left.  We are telling everyone we know to go here for Korean food.  The price is reasonable for what you get, plus they also have a military discount.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love Korean food and was happy to see this place open so close to work... maybe because it's new or that nobody makes bulgogi better than my wife, but the bulgogi lacked flavor and the meat still had a lot of fat and the traditional sides had A LOT of salt. The place was clean, the service was good and food looked great...I'm sure they get better as time goes by.  I'd go again..."}
{"text":"Closed. Number out of service. This is the same place as http://www.yelp.com/biz/korea-house-bbq-las-vegas"}

{"text":"My family and I recently went to this restaurant, because my hubby is Korean and we've been waiting for something to open closer to the base, since we are a military family and don't like driving down to spring mountain for good Korean food. At first I was a little nervous to eat here just because it's connected to a Motel, and the area surrounding the restaurant is notoriously sketchy. I braved my fears and stopped by the other afternoon with my hubby and baby. I have to say the food was super delicious, and my hubby said that many of the dishes tasted close to what his mom cooks at home. Which in my opinion is the ultimate compliment. We had the spicy chicken, spicy seafood tofu soup, and kimchi onion pancake. It was all super amazing. We also enjoyed the traditional appetizers served before the meal as well. Our food also included Daikon soup, which many restaurants dont serve with their food and I really like. If you're looking for a good, reasonably priced korean restuarant near the base. This is your place! Plus our waitress was great, very friendly and helpful. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Okay sorry to be the noob of the Korean lovers, i just came to taste random items on the list. 

After being seated and having my order been taken, appetizers were brought to the table and the only one that seemed to taste good (or had taste at all) was the Kimchi. Dont ask me why or criticize me! The other rest just didnt catch my attention.

My entree was the beef Bulgogi with a side order of Codfish Pancakes. 
The beef was very tasty and came with many side items to pick at while you ate but, the only thing was... they came out to be just like the appetizers! So i just ended up eating the Kimchi, Bulgogi with rice. 
The Codfish cakes came out to be very fishy and oily, therefore i just ate two.

I did NOT get my moneys worth since I walked out the door still hungry ."}
{"text":"I work on Nellis AFB and have been exited for this place to open every since I saw the sign go up. Today I finally had the opportunity to stop in with my wife and daughter. The Yaki Mandu appetizer was equally as good as any I have had in Vegas; however, we all raved about the spicy chicken wings. Collectively we ordered two lunchboxes (Kalbi, Bulgogi) and the stone pot bibimbap.  While the flavor was not as good as I had in Korea, they were very good and exceed most places I have eaten in this town. If you consider the $42 price tag (including drinks) for more very good food than you should eat, this place is a great value. I frequent Korean BBQ places in town where one Kalbi order approaches that price. The portion sizes were generous and our sides dishes were refilled several times. I will no doubt return to to the Korea House very soon."}
{"text":"We were here on a slow day (2 other patrons were dining in) and were craving some kalbi and bibimbap. Their 8.99 lunch specials are potentially a good deal but my kalbi was seriously lacking in flavor, the side salad wilted/almost brown, 2 pieces of maki roll was dry and inedible, and the jap chae was forgettable. My husband's bibimbap is okay; nothing to write home about and for $13 he was expecting to have a little bit more meat in his dish. 

The service was nonexistent at first. We didn't have to wait too long for our orders to come out, but nobody checked in on us until we were almost done with our meal. The complimentary refills on the banchan are nice, but I've had way better banchan before. I can't help but think of other Korean bbq joints that are also right outside military bases and sadly it pales in comparison. I think for now I'm gonna have to venture out a little bit farther to get my Korean food fix."}
{"text":"Adequate Korean food.  Kimchee had waaaaaayyyyyyyy toooooooo much vinegar."}
