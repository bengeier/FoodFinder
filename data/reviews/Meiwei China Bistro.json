{"text":"Awesome PHO soup cannot beat the price @ $9.50 anywhere in this area! Service could use improvement however the food and prices are well worth going back!"}
{"text":"We love Mei Wei.  We often go for lunch- it is delicious and includes soup, salad, egg roll, rice and main dish for a very reasonable price.  The staff is super friendly.  We have done take out via delivery and were really pleased.  I would recommend you try this tiny,  quaint little restaurant- the food is delicious and the staff are great."}
{"text":"This is good place to enjoy with friend. Or family. Plenty choice of Chinese and Vietnamese food with perfect taste and good price. Service is very friendly and good  asmophize. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First off let's start with this place is under new management. We made the misfortunous mistake of going to get take out in January of 2015. The staff was friendly enough but they had plenty of time to be so because our order took forever. Granted it was a $60.00 order so we were forgiving of the wait. Got home with our food, excited to dig in. That excitement soon passed.  Hot and sour soup was inedible, Pupu platter did not have the food that was listed on it.  Started opening the containers with our food only to find out that they were anywhere from half full to maybe 70% full.  The combo lo mein which should have had chicken, pork and shrimp had only 3 pieces of chicken and nothing else.  I have always been of the mindset to let a restaurant make good on mistakes so I called and told the owner would be in the next day.  Called him and explained the situation and he seemed somewhat confused but assured us he wanted to make the situation right.  He informed us next time we ate there that our meal would be comped and I told him I appreciated it.  We decided to let them have a little while to get their kitchen straightened out and called Sunday afternoon to make an order.  The girl who answered the phone stated the owner was there but on another line.  She took my name and number and stated she would have him call me back.  After waiting an hour I called back only to be told then owner just left and she couldn't help me.  At this point I feel I have no other recourse then to post my experience in hopes it will help others like myself who were incorrectly influenced by the positive reviews that were made when the restaurant  was under the old management."}
{"text":"Slightly below average place. Would only eat lunch here.Food is average at best. Have never actually seen a chinese person at this resteraunt. Seating is very tight as they are trying to fit 30 tables into a place that should only have 15-20."}
{"text":"Got a few items takeout with the wife last week. I am not really sure exactly what she ordered but there was an orange peel chicken that was very tasty, you can tell it is a little higher quality than panda express with thicker chicken and less breading with a more natural orange taste. Also tried out some sort of noodles with beef pork and chicken. The noodles were very thin sort of like angel hair pasta and had a sort of crunch to them, they were very tasty. I checked out the takeout menu and they have alot to offer and at a good price. Glad I bought a home right near this place, will be back after my next asian craving."}
{"text":"Disappointed. When I found this restaurant 5 years ago I was excited. Food was AMAZING. I come from Philly and used to eat at Chinatown all the time. The food at this place tasted just like a Chinatown restaurant. Now, what the heck has happened. The orange chicken was my fav, crispy, saucy, and real pieces of orange. Now is just a bland, chunk of chicken with a light coating of something.  Now I have to find a new place to get my Chinese food fix. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Placed our delivery order 45 minutes before they closed.  Never received our food.  Restaurant never answered our calls.  I wouldn't waste my time with this place."}
{"text":"I visited Mei Wei once last year, and came back this year.  Honestly, I'm not really certain why I did, as nothing about this restaurant does anything to distinguish itself.  Nothing is awful, but nothing was really memorable.

I had the Kung Pao Chicken for lunch.  It was...meh.  Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that they have some amazing house fried rice, and I'm picky about my rice. I think I will forever be biased against fried rice since I'm used to the kind they serve in Puerto Rico--nothing can ever live up to that. However, Mei Wei comes close. It is the best I've had in the valley, hands down. We have been here a few times, and the food has been good. We went a few days ago though, and it was a HUGE disappointment. My husband got the beef and broccoli lunch special, and the portion sizes were ridiculously tiny. They must have given him the wrong soup too, because he asked for egg drop and got some weird, brown soup that was sour and spicy. Also, he wanted plain fried wontons and they gave him some pork filled stuff. It was just a disappointment all around. We will be back, because this was an isolated incident, but this time we will only go for dinner. We can get much more for our money elsewhere when it comes to lunch specials."}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese food. After living in SF, I am somewhat of a snob when it comes to my Chinese, and so far this is the best I have had in the area. Very good potstickers!"}
{"text":"The food is not very good. Better than some of the chains, but I prefer Big Buddha at the 303 and Greenway. Better food and lower prices."}
{"text":"We got to the restaurant at 6:05pm on a Tuesday ...one family was leaving and we were the only one's there.......10 minutes after we ordered we were told there was no sweet. & sour. We re ordered....after another family came in AND WERE SERVED THEIR MEAL......and nearly 40 mins after we were seated....no food......We left.....No service terrible, terrible...."}
{"text":"Decent prices.
Large portions.
fresh food. 

Egg drop soup was a mix of egg drop, Chicken and Miso. Nothing fantastic about it but not horrible. Orange chicken was great, not too spicy and not too sweet. Broccoli beef was evenly proportioned with both ingredients. Cashew Chicken was ok."}
{"text":"This was the First & LAST time I will ever trying this establishment. Ordered 4 Lunch \"Specials\" BUT there was Nothing special at all. The meals were suppose to come with Soup, Egg roll, Salad & fruit. Two came with Stale-Old rice and two had just an Egg roll. There was No salad or soup but I doubt it would of made a difference as the Food was Horrible!! I get Lunch time but it was embarrassing to look at a more than half empty plate. The noodles & anything that needed to be fried tasted like Burnt Oil!!! The Teriyaki Chicken clearly states with broccoli Not \"Only 1 Broccoli\" is which I ended up getting. So if you want something good or decent, drive to your usual place Or just go with Panada Express. Don't waste your money, this place is a Disappointment!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a couple of years now but haven't been in a while.  Seems like the past couple of visits the quality has gone down.  They don't always have my favorite egg plant dish and coming from Buckeye, I am not a happy camper going all that way only for them to tell me that they are out.

Like a previous poster mentioned, the food is \"ok\" but nothing great.  It's a shame because I used to think they were really good.  What happened?

The only thing holding me back not giving them 2 stars is that it has been a few months since we've been there.  It would be unfair to rate them now b'c I don't know if they've improved since then or have changed managers."}
{"text":"This was the worset moo goo gai pan I've ever had"}
{"text":"I legitimately made an account on here just so I could leave a review. I've tried many different location for this cuisine in different states some bad some worse some so delicious I could cry. But this? Hands down, the worst I've ever experienced. Now, let me start off by saying this is the second time I've eaten here. The first time, I ordered their sizzling rice soup (a favorite of mine) and it was average. Not bad, certainly not great, but not bad. It was enough to give it a chance tonight when I got a craving for some BBQ pork. So, I called in and ordered some of that pork along with an order of potstickers (you get your choice or chicken or pork, I got pork) for takeout. When I asked about the dipping sauce the woman on the phone informed me it's \"potsticker sauce\" (oh? I would have never figured that out) apparently she didn't know anything about it and to her credit offered to ask the cooks but I told her not to go through the trouble that it was fine. The only reason this review is getting two stars is because it was fairly speedy, they told me 10-15 minutes and they were true to their word. Anyway. So, I get home seriously stoked to grub on this food until I open the little box potstickers. It took one glance for my happy little hungry self to deflate into a puddle of disappointment as the pale, greasy, thick pockets of what I can only call a waste of $6 stared back at me. But I don't judge a dumpling by it's sad cover, so I dip it into that mystery sauce and take a bite. Immediately, I knew why the waitress didn't know anything about describing the sauce. There is no other way to describe it except \"bad\". That's right, a sauce so awful my entire vocabulary got up and left me, and I can only describe as really, really bad. The actual potsticker itself was flavorless, dry, and chewy. In fact, I'm pretty sure that if I hadn't spit it out I'd still be chewing on that one potsticker. This was an hour ago. If you're curious about the BBQ pork, it was no better. It was all salt, no moisture and just, no good. This was definitely my last trip here. Please do yourself a favor and stay away from this place as well. On a side note: the staff seemed pretty friendly."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for lunch today, and ordered the \"Lunch Specials\". For $6.00, or $7.00 ( depending on entrée chosen ) you get a cup of soup, egg roll, salad, white or fried rice, and your entrée. The chicken lo mein was very tasty, and they use all white meat chicken. The kung pao shrimp was equally as tasty. Both plates came with the food hot, right out of the wok. Service was very attentive and polite. Two things though, which have nothing to do with the quality of food detailed above. At 12:30 on a Friday, we were the only couple in the restaurant. It also does not look like a Chinese Restaurant. It has a boiler room feel. The place definitely needs sprucing up. It's also small, with about 9 tables, plus 3 booths. This area is heavily laden with Chinese Restaurants and several buffets. Many of the locals prefer to gorge themselves at the buffets where you can eat until your heart's content for just about the same $7.00 for lunch. Too bad. It really hurts places like Mei Wei who serve quality food at reasonable prices. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Being a workaholic it's nice to have a good chinese place that delivers around here. I'm the kind of person that once I find my favorite dish that's all I'll ever order. So my last couple dozen orders have been either the mongolian beef with crab wontons or the thai coconut curry beef with egg rolls. Both delicious just depends what mood I'm in."}
{"text":"I do not know what the hell happened. EVERYTHING was different and not for the better. Taste was VERY different, presentation was different, My god it went downhill. Really too bad it WAS excellent. UGGGH I hate this type of stuff with restaurants."}
{"text":"I will never go here again. While eating here today an elderly man came in and asked about the help wanted sign in the window. The waitress told him that the sign was left up by mistake. The owner of Mei Wei was sitting in the lobby which at this time got up and went in to the kitchen. Once the old man left the owner came out and yelled and cussed the waitress for not telling the old man to leave. She sat in the lobby and cried has he screamed at her."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed! Was visiting with friends from out of state we ordered food to have it delivered. An hour and a half later the food had not come I called and they said the lady had just left and would be there soon. Another 20 minutes later when the food arrived it was cold and greasy. When I called the restaurant I was told they should have told me they had that long of a wait duh! I spoke with the owner who whined and said that she didn't have enough drivers. My father are if the owner doesn't have enough drivers since you should hire them. It was a Monday night! Very sad and disappointed."}
{"text":"Let me start off with the fact that there are 'wei\" too many restaurants in Surprise with \"Wei\" in their name. I started out my lunchtime intending to order from Golden Wei, but forgot the name and ordered from Mei Wei instead. There really is nothing wrong with Mei Wei, but their portions are pretty small and I've now been there twice and really not much of an intention to return. My Moo Goo was fine, however when you open up your takeout box and see more white Styrofoam than chicken, it's not a great thing. I'll say the portions given are probably more in line with what we should be eating, but when I'm hungry and want lunch, I'd rather have leftovers. I would estimate less than a  1/4 pound of chicken in my meal. It tasted fine, but just not much to taste. I will say their egg drop soup was really good."}
{"text":"Started with some salty crab puffs and some excellent chicken egg rolls. Nothing to rave about. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Just ordered Take Out for the family.. Broccoli&Beef, Teriyaki Chicken, Mongolian Beef all with brown rice. It ALL is fantastic! Very flavorful even the broccoli has excellent flavor! Will be back for sure:)"}
{"text":"Very good , nice little place nestled in the strip mall , but all good , got 2 luncheon specials for wife and I and we enjoyed them, waitress great she does everything, bartends, hostess,waitresses gotta give credit were credit is due!!!!!"}
{"text":"Did they close down?  Finally found a place that made the food just the way i like it. Just enough spicy to where i didnt have to add more. They arent answering the phone. Not happy."}
{"text":"When it comes to Surprise, there aren't many options of Chinese food. This place, however, is the exception. The food here is very good. I have had it both, dine in and delivery, and both times I greatly enjoyed their food. Their orange chicken is very good and so are their appetizers. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a change from Panda Express but still wanting affordable good food."}
{"text":"I really wanted to leave a good review for this place, but that is not what is about to happen. Lesson learned here: Check the Yelp reviews before ordering an sitting in the restaurant. 

New Years day, one day a year that you probably, like most Americans, do not want to cook. For dinner my girlfriend suggested Chinese food, a simple request that ended with me still hungry. Since they are one of the closest places to me, I placed an order on-line, this turned out to be mistake #2, with mistake #1 being that I didn't check Yelp before deciding on this place. 

The on-line order processing was great since I didn't want to be bothered with a phone call. However, after arriving at Meiwei, they said that the only order they had was scheduled for a pickup time 45 minutes after what I was told. So they apologized and put in my order. Perhaps at this point they should have asked if that was in fact my order they were putting in.

The order was presented to me in normal time. While I was waiting I started looking at the reviews... Rutt Roh! I ordered the sesame chicken as mentioned by someone else, and when any restaurant is labeled as inconsistent, you really have to wonder what you are in for. Mistake #3, not checking the order.

When I got home I thought the order had a few extra items, which I figured they might have been using as a way to make up for the mistake of not putting in my order. Nope! Dead wrong. This wasn't my order! 

Now this is where it gets interesting... Would you bring back an order that has more items than you ordered that actually looks good? Mistake #4, I brought it back.

When I did get the correct order I was wishing I kept the previous orders. The Sesame chicken that I was now really ready to eat, because I ordered it over an hour before was, how should we say, not good. Every place I have ever ordered it uses chunks of chicken, this place uses slivers, and as mentioned by argen t., there is hardly any breading and the sauce is real watery. By slivers I mean that it was about the thickness of lettuce, and maybe 1 inch wide by 2 - 4 inches long.

I also ordered 2 appetizers, the spare ribs, which aren't ribs, they are more like spare parts an inch in length, and an order of spring rolls. Out of the 2 spring rolls, I could only down part of one. 

I do have to mention that the vegetable fried rice that I got for my girlfriend was pretty good.

As I said in the beginning, I really wanted to write a good review because the employee I was working with went out of her way to make everything right, including throwing in an order of crab-puffs for my trouble. 

For the service I would give Meiwei 4 stars, however let's be honest it's the food that makes or breaks a restaurant which pulls this down to a 2 because I don't have the heart to give them a 1."}
{"text":"We couldn't get seated at Eureka Grill one night so we ended up here because its next door and we've been back a couple of times since. The food is a little inconsistent here. Sometimes mediocre, sometimes bad. The soups are surprisingly good and the large bowl of won ton soup for 2 actually serves 4 generously. The sesame chicken is too lightly breaded and the sauce is dark and watery. The spring and egg rolls are very oily and soggy. The lemon chicken has notes of NyQuil. The service is excellent  and prices reasonable.  They really do try hard to please and I'll be back for the soup and lo mein."}
{"text":"If you are allergic to bean sprouts as I am do not go here. We ordered delivery for the family and guest and specifically asked for no bean sprouts. $68 dollars later I got a plate of Singapore noodles that had more sprouts than noodle! The beef skewers were not good at all."}
{"text":"Oh gawd, another shitty Chinese food place in Surprise. This place is actually ran by Chinese people but of course they stick with \"Asian\" (actually American) favorites. I guess tried and true pays the rent every month but they should know that different pays off, look at Vogue Bistro.

Tried a few lunch specials including Kung Pao Chicken and Ma Po Tofu.. each came with a soggy spring roll as well as white rice. However if you eat in you'll also get a bowl of soup and a salad, we did take out. The Kung Pao was Kung lame with not much flavor or heat. The Ma Po Tofu was bland and didn't have any of the veggies that the menu promised. Even the addition of chile paste could save this one. However the Chicken Egg Rolls are pretty good and managed to stay crispy. 

Pei Wei is still the best Surprise has to offer on terms of Asian food, though that isn't saying much at all."}
{"text":"3.5

Great Customer Service!

I liked my Orange Chicken lunch meal as it came with fried rice, spring roll, salad and plenty of oragne chicken. The soup was ok too. 

Every thing was fresh and hot (or cold as need be) but the chicken was sliced so thin I really never knew if it was chicken or not. 

Do not let that stop you though. We just need to let them know ....  thicker slices please."}
{"text":"Don't buy a Groupon for Meiwei. We purchased a Groupon with the idea of trying something new. What a rip off. Groupon was for $30 worth of food for $15. As soon as we sat down they asked if we had a Groupon and asked for it in advance. We ordered our meals and choose to add the Combo which includes spring roll and soup. We had read the fine print that stated the Groupon did not include dinner specials so we didn't see any dinner special in the menu so just ordered. When we got the bill they only thing they applied to the Groupon was the base price of the entree...not the soup and egg roll, not the drinks (which they charged for hot tea, which is usually complimentary at Chinese restaurants).  Bottom line for a $30 Groupon value we were only credited $20. When we complained they said the additional stuff we ordered was the dinner special. We said it didn't say that on the menu and they said it was in their computer!!  As for the food, it was okay except for what they called fried rice. It was basically white rice with soy sauce on it...no veggies, no egg, no meat. They really defeated the purpose of a Groupon which is to get new customers. We won't go back."}
{"text":"I found myself leaving work late last night on the drive home looking forward to a good meal.  Only to find out that my Wife was having dinner with her Mother and I was on my own.  Feeling like something different I start cruising around surprise looking to see if anything new sprang up.  

I remembered seeing the sign for Mei Wei and wondered if they thought maybe they would get more business by varying their namesake by one letter to the popular chain.  Nonetheless I decided to stop in.

I walked in and the the restaurant had a dark mood lit feel, but was actually well decorated.  It also appeared very clean.   I was immediately greeted and the staff was very cordial,  I started looking over a menu to get take out and was offered a recommendation.  

I should have been weary when they offered the Orange Peel Chicken.  but I gave it a chance because they used the word peel and just orange chicken, got an order of egg rolls too just to try.   10 minutes later my food was ready and I was on my way.  I got home and was pleasantly surprised by the portion size and including the egg rolls probably could have fed 2 people.  The food itself unfortunately was mediocre, the usual white rice and crispy meat faire, which isn't bad but for 12.50 I was expecting a bit more.

Food was ok but lacked any sort of flare or appeal, almost wonder if this would be a better lunch destination.  It's official Surprise is culturally bankrupt when it comes to Chinese/Asian food.  I might try it again, but don't hold your breath.

Better wipe the lipstick off my collar before Pei Wei finds out."}
{"text":"Ordered meiwei delivery. The food got here earlier than expected, fried rice was excellent and spectacular Mongolian beef. Will be ordering again! P.S. Love the online ordering!"}
{"text":"Meiwei has decent typical American Chinese food.  It's not great, it's not bad, but there's better food around.   It's just middling in the road.  I certainly won't recommend MeiWei to San Gabriel Valley citizens, but I would order MeiWei for catering to feed to the masses.  Not much to say about this place, especially when I'm not used to or even enjoy this kind of Chinese food."}
{"text":"We been here so many times it use to be our \"Sunday place\" to go. But the service has been getting worse every time we go in. Yesterday we had gotten take out, the smallest portions I had every seen from here. Probably not going to be our \"Sunday Place\" anymore."}
{"text":"Stopped by on lunch. Ordered the Lo Mein Shrimp lunch special with white rice, egg roll, salad and soup. Lo Mein shrimp, decorative tangerine, and sweet/sour sauce was excellent. Salad and egg roll where ok. The white rice was ok but it seamed like they gave me the rice that was stuck on the bottom of the rice cooker. Some of it was pretty hard. Place was clean, staff was ok and might stop by again."}
{"text":"I came by here the other evening for a quick take out order when I had this undeniable urge for orange chicken. Not being from this area I was kinda at a loss at what is the best and safest bet for good chinese food. 

Walking in the establishment was pretty empty - the young man working the front of the house was beyond friendly and accommodating.
I ordered the orange chicken, egg drop soup, egg rolls. 
Frankly I wish I could say that the food here was out of the world, simply because the service was amazing and makes me want to come back, but the food was so underwhelming that I don't think I will be. :("}
{"text":"Great lunch specials. Priced 6-7 dollars. Served in a bento box you will receive soup eggroll and salad with your choice of white or fried rice.  I choose the hot and sour soup. And it is very tasty.  I like the chicken lo mein.  This place is under new management and the servers are very nice. If you have been here before you will notice that they knocked out a wall for a more open dining room.  I like this better."}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad. It def was slightly diff from the American Chinese food I am used to back home. Egg rolls were really good."}
{"text":"Two unofficial ratings for this place would be \"eh\" and \"so so\". We ordered the General Tsao Chicken, Sweet n Sour Pork, Orange Peel Chicken, and Vegi Lo mein. Everything was decent but nothing blew my mind. I was really disappointed with the Tsao's chicken, it was good but not tsao's at all, and not even spicy. The best was probably the lo mein. 
And the servings were small. We usually order enough for left overs but not this time, thank goodness we 'over order'. There was none left."}
{"text":"Hmm.

1. Apparently if you come alone they will assume you are just there for pickup and let you stand expectantly for awhile.

2. Mei Wei might mean good place for older guys to relentlessly try to hit on single women who just want to eat and read.

3. Here sesame chicken translates as chicken nuggets topped with sugar water.

4. Not a place I'd return to eat or meet someone."}
{"text":"I love this place. Been going here since it opened. The food is very good. Prices are reasonable and the portions are large. The service is friendly."}
{"text":"Mei Wei has good Chinese food.  The servers are kind and friendly.  Overall a nice place to enjoy a good meal."}
{"text":"The best Chinese delivery in the area.  We've been ordering approximately two times a month for a 6-7 months and we're always very pleased."}
{"text":"Cute neighborhood place for Chinese food. 
They also have take out. The meals taste like they are cooked to order and the rolls have not been cooked and kept under a heat lamp. 

The hot and sour soup is super. The other items are pretty standard for this type of food. They will be glad to add or take away the \"heat\" as desired. Friendly staff. We keep coming back because of  freshness friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great little place.  The vegetable lo mein is super yummy and my kids loved the orange chicken."}
{"text":"OMG! Best Chinese Food Ever! Ordered delivery last night for the first time and enjoyed their combination lo mein, eggplant dish and mango chicken with fired rice! It is absolute heaven. Prices are reasonable with fast delivery. The 10% discount helped too. Will definitely order again next week!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but the service was pretty much non-existent. Our order was taken, the food was brought and when we showed up at the counter, we got a bill - other than that, no service. Won't go back."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it zero stars!  The food here was awful!!!   We ordered the Pork Fried Rice, General Tso's Chicken, Chicken Lo Mein and Sweet 'n Sour Pork.  So bland and tasteless, what a waste of money.  I would NOT recommend this to anyone!  Jade Star and China 7 are so much better than this place!"}
{"text":"Glad I didn't read some of these reviews before going.  We were in the neighborhood and wanted something quick and not too filling.  WOW, we loved it.  I had egg drop soup and my husband had sweet and sour soup.  Mine was just a tad in need of some salt and pepper, my husbands was delicious. I ordered Sesame chicken and husband had sweet and sour pork.  Both of us ordered fried rice.  When the order came we were very impressed.  It was plated beautifully.  We also had a salad with the best vinaigrette we have ever had, rice was perfect and the sesame chicken was cooked beautifully.  We even had orange slices that were fresh and tasty.  Oh, and an egg roll too with sauce.  I couldn't believe all that food for $5.95.  Service was wonderful and the server was pretty cute too.  We are trying to find reasons we need to go back to Surprise so we can eat there again."}
{"text":"My hubby and I came to Mei Wei not too sure if this was going to be good.  We went in on a Saturday night at 8pm and the place was dead, like literally there was no one else in the restaurant.  But we sat down and they gave us wonton chips and sweet n sour sauce, it was okay. 
We ordered pork egg rolls, very yummy, and crab wontons, they were also yummy but a little greasy.  
We weren't super hungry so we decided to just order shrimp lo mein and combination fried rice.  The shrimp lo mein was delicious!  Unfortunately the fried rice was dry and tasteless.  
Overall service was awesome and food was really good."}
