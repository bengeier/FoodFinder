{"text":"After coming back from China for vacation, I have been missing the food quite a bit.  But my parents suggested trying the restaurant which specializes in northern Chinese food.  We were surprised how much it resembles the food we had in China.  It was not oily nor salty.  The flavours were rich, and hearty.  It was plain and fresh.  We watched the ladies make dumplings and noodles in the kitchen.  Good portions, because we were bloated with 4 plates ordered.  It was enjoyable~"}
{"text":"I love Northern Chinese food because the flavours are so different from the Southern Chinese food I grew up with.  The Northern Chinese know how to cook lamb so we got an order of cumin flavoured lamb skewers.  They were delicious.  Very nicely seasoned and very juicy.  We also got the Golden Harvest dumplings.  There were 3 types of dumplings made with 3 different types of wrappers.  We couldn't quite figure out what they were made of,  but they were filled with yummy vegetarian filling.  They were good, however, I think I prefer the dumplings at another restaurant down the street that specializes in dumplings."}
{"text":"Good authentic northern Chinese food. Too bad they only speak Mandarin. Cash only unless over $20 (Debit)"}
{"text":"Came here with my family and ordered a bunch of dumplings since I was told it was their specialty. I don't know the exact names of the dishes since I didn't do the ordering so excuse the vagueness of this review.   All the steamed dumplings we ordered were amazing. The pan fried ones were good too but I noticed the skin was much thicker and chewier so that kind of took away from the flavor.   We ordered the lamb skewers which were really good but a bit fatty. We also ordered the cucumber and jellyfish salad (very refreshing among all the great and heat) and the spicy pork intestines (be careful eating the hot peppers - I don't know exactly what this is called, but when you eat it, it makes part of your tongue feel like it's a bit numb).   Service was okay (general Chinese restaurant service), but the food was prompt.   I definitely think it's a place worth checking out if you like dumplings."}
{"text":"I just had a family dinner here for the first time, we were impressed by their food! We thought they would probably have really plain and simple dish due to the name of this place but surprisingly they have a lot of delicious and unique dishes! I recommend their lamb dumplings if you're a lamb lover. The peanut butter mix with cold noodles and chicken is probably the best ever!!!!!! Also, their dessert fried egg white with red bean is so awesome! Overall this is a great place except my family and I don't really like the manager of this place"}
{"text":"This is our second visit and it was a few years apart between visits.  We only went back to give it a second try because a friend had recommended it.  We eat out a lot at all the various mainland chinese restaurants in GTA (mostly in Scarborough, Richmond Hill areas).   Amongst 6 of us we tried various dishes and overall found everything to be very mediocre at best.  I guess they really haven't changed much since our previous visit."}
{"text":"Plain tasting food I had the worst hot and sour soup!  It was salty and had very little content.  The mapo tofu had only the taste of saltiness, no other taste.  Service was rather unattentive.  One visit was enough for me."}
{"text":"This is recommanded by my sister-in-law, I gave 4 stars of my first try! My hubby & I ordered 3 dishes on that day: Wonton soup (20pcs), Braised beef noodle & sugar crusted taro. The wonton is really yummy, the bite size full of pork mince & leek, the soup is surprisingly good as not too salty & it containes seaweed. The braised beef noodle was amazing! The beef was so tender & rich in flavour, I like the texture of the noodle, it's little chewy as they were hand made,  maybe this unique texture, the stock (soup) can easily coat over the noodle, the taste is so wonderful! Finally the dessert, sugar crusted taro was a difficult one to make, I've seen it from Youtube, so many complicated steps. The taste was perfect IF those taro deep fired for a bit longer."}
{"text":"We order 6 dishes, everything are good, and very fast. The services also good and they gave us the soy milk for free."}
{"text":"Why is this place a four star status? There are so many better dumpling joints closeby that are way waaaaay better in terms of value, quality, and taste. I had dumplings, ma pa tofu, lamb skewers, and fried rice and it is mediocre at best  My boyfriend is from northern China and he didn't like this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has a good atmosphere with friendly staffs.  It is a favourite of mine because they make really yummy dumpling with flavourful broth and thin dumpling skin.  Today, they were also steamed to perfection.  The dumpling with pork and vegetable is a favourite of mine.  The chickenwith dipping suace was also wonderful.  The servers were quite attentive, and they took some napkins over for me to dry after I spilled my tea without me asking.  The colourful steamed buns were a little on the chewy side, not as fluffy as I thought, but still quite good.  The wonton soup had really good hearty flavours that still retains the clear consomme look.    I don't have anything bad to say about this place except the form of payment is only limited to cash and debit card."}
{"text":"We ordered several items, and were happy with everything. In particular a few dishes were really good:  -cold noodles with chicken (the texture and taste of noodles was great). Had a slightly peppery taste that I really liked  -lamb with scallions: lamb was cooked well, and there was a generous amount of meat  -Also ordered vegetable noodles, which  were fine... again I really liked the noodles, but I think I would've liked a larger variety of vegetables (it was primarily eggplant).  -Fried dumplings were pretty decent... good value -Beef roll was fine too, but I always compare beef rolls to my favorite place in LA (101 Noodles), and nothing comes close unfortunately  -Desert item (red bean in an egg white type puff) was pretty decent. It's a huge dish though... comes with 6 pretty large puffs. So I'd only order this  if I were in a party of 6 or more  There's a fairly big parking lot for this plaza, but it does get pretty packed (with bad drivers). Accepts credit card. Staff are a little slow.   Will return!"}
{"text":"I went here with some Chinese friends and had some dishes I loved and had never seen anywhere else before, though I consider myself an aficionado of Chinese food. Chive dumplings and clearish thick noodles (don't know what they are called) with vegetables especially excellent. I feel this place really deserves more stars than it has. My relatives and I were the only Caucasians in the whole place."}
{"text":"I was super happy with my meal here. We had the beef noodle soup, some dumplings (sorry can't be more specific) and this pork belly with garlic dish, that was very good.  They were all really tasty. I had leftovers and they were tasty still! My buddy lives down the street, so I'm certain we'll be hitting this place again."}
{"text":"Very decent food at reasonable prices. I'm too used to Southern Chinese food and decided on Northern for a change. I'm glad I tried this place. Like most Chinese restaurants, they have a very extensive menu. I don't know the English names but we had some seafood noodles, the fish in a tray of spicy sauce, dumplings, sea cucumber, chilli spicy chicken, and a bowl of wonton.   Everything was good. I'm not sure if it's because they spotted us as Southerners. But compared to other northern chinese places, it's less oily and salty. It was not busy and the server made a very good effort to help us with the menu selection. We asked for less spicy. The food had a very distinct Northern Chinese flavor.   I would come again for sure. We had the fish tray thing and sea cucumber which made the bill a bit expensive but if I just get \"normal\" stuff, dining here is incredibly affordable. So apparently this is a place that can cater to many needs with their extensive menu."}
{"text":"Very good northern Chinese food! The dumpling is a surprise for me! One of the best dumpling restaurants! However, the portions are smaller than before."}
{"text":"I ate here tonight and the food was amazing!! We had noodles with veggies that were soooooo yummy (eggplant especially good), spicy chicken, lamb kabobs, and chinese pizza. We also had some red bean dessert. It was all amazing and the service was excellent.  Would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"After a long day outside in the cold, always good to warm up with a lamb hotpot. I've had this same dish at many restaurants, but I find this place is one of the best. They are very generous with the lamb and the quality of the meat is decent and not overly fatty.  The only downside to this place is nobody speaks English. So they often get your order wrong. One time I ordered 3 sets of frozen dumplings to-go and they cooked them all. The previous two times, I asked them to make the lamb hotpot without the chilli peppers and they always forget and still add the chilli. When I tell them that they got the order wrong, they just dump the broth and add new broth, with still loads of chilli still stuck to the meat. At least the very last time after reminding them 3 times, the order came right and it was great.  The giant fried dumplings at this place is always juicy and delicious. The beef pancake roll and sesame pancake is also really good.   Overall, I like coming here, but ordering in English is a real gamble. When they get the order right, this place is great, but other times can be really frustrating."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to this restaurant based on recommendations from friends, and it was excellent.  We went around 9pm, and had a chance to talk with the owner in Mandarin.    The food was authentic and executed at a very high level.  On point with the flavours, mouth feel and the overall composition of the dishes.  They make authentic Chinese Northeastern food, and the chef owner is an experienced chef.  The restaurant is very clean.  Would highly recommend that you give it a try!"}
{"text":"Based on the number of good ratings from the Elites, I thought I would give it a try.  I was surprised to see Beef Brisket and Chinese Radish on the lunch menu.  I am a big fan, so this was a no brainer.  I started with the soup, which seems to be a Tomato Hot and Sour, different, just a nice heat to it, and good flavour.  Then my lunch arrived-surprise!  It was Beef Brisket and Chinese Radish SOUP!  Oh, well, maybe I didn't look closely enough at the menu.  This was a big tureen of soup, filled with radish in an impossibly rich and flavorful soup base.  I cleaned it up, and forgot about the rice sitting on the table.  This was a nice surprise, and overall a good experience.  I am still looking for a place that makes the brisket and radish as a stew, if you have a suggestion, drop me a note!"}
{"text":"Finally opened a new place here! been way too long....My friend suggested that we come here for dinner. I didn't even know Golden Harvest even took over this place. I enjoy the fact that there is photos for every item on the menu. It makes my life so much easier because I can't read simplified chinese..  The food was A-OK...nothing really wow'd me in terms of the food. Everything was just OK. Nothing super delicious that was memorable.  We ordered quite a bit of food. The portions were decent.   I may be back when I am in the area but I won't go out of my way to come"}
{"text":"I would have, at least, given this restaurant a 3 stars if the woman (the manager) who is serving us tonight a little more friendly.   When your customer is asking you for an advice on the portion size of a dessert item, please be kind enough to let your customer know even though you have no idea.  Responding something like \"how can I count how many pieces for you\" is absolutely mean and unhelpful.  Besides, who asked her to count???  The food here is ok.  I tried this place the first time during lunch hour, I like the food.  We come back a group of 8 persons for dinner tonight.  I wonder if I wanna come back again because of this manager's attitude.  There are so many better places in the area in terms of food and service."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. We ordered our usual Northern Chinese dishes to see how they rank. Everything was good but nothing spectacular.  We were not a big fan of the Golden Harvest Dumplings where it was mostly vegetarian fillings and not much filling."}
{"text":"I have to say their dumplings are very tasty. But everything else was crap.  We ordered Braised chicken with potatoes and \"green pepper\". Those peppers are the most spicy peppers I've ever had, considering I eat Hakka food regular. There's no way says \"suicidal spicy\" or even spicy on the menu! My boyfriend almost choked from heat, he probably chucked down whole pitch of iced water.  The mushroom and broccoli dish was also wayyyyy to salty. Will never go back"}
{"text":"I don't know about authentic but the good here is delicious. Nice family style restaurant serving northern Chinese food in the neighborhood. They have dumplings, soup filled dumplings, beef rolls, marinated sliced beef, pork with steamed buns. Delicious. Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"We came here last night just shy of 7PM and had to wait about 20 minutes for a table..not too bad but there isn't much standing space in this restaurant.  We ordered six dishes for four people and ended up having to take maybe 1/5 of it home.   We ordered the soup filled dumplings (6.95 for 6 pieces); sautéed slice sea whelks; braised beef noodle soup; cold dish sliced potatoes to name a few.  The portions are quite generous and the presentation of the dishes are fantastic--very visually appealing!  ** Do note that the takeout menus they have do not have updated pricing, the menu they give you in the restaurant reflects a price increase of about $1 per dish."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Saturday. Ordered the pork ribs pot, stir fried tofu, and seafood noodle soup. The noodle soup I would pass on next time but the other dishes were pretty home style tasting. I'd come back again and try some of what the regulars were ordering. Everyone who's been there before seemed to order the same thing of steamed dumplings and noodles and duck or chicken."}
{"text":"Out of all the Chinese restaurants in this plaza that I could regularly order from, I chose Golden Harvest. I'll give you three reasons:  1. Their braised beef noodle soup is simply amazing. I'm really picky when it comes to noodle and pasta doneness, and Golden Harvest always does it right.  2. Prices are very affordable. You can spend ~$10-15 and walk away with a full stomach.  3. Portions are very generous, and I always finish my meal very content and happy.  I've yet to switch up my regular orders, but I'd recommend their lamb kebabs, steamed dumplings, and braised beef noodle soup."}
{"text":"The food is always amazing here! Every time we go we always order lamb skewers and lamb dumplings - so flavourful!   We've tried a bunch of their noodles choices and all of them are very good. The noodles are usually at a nice al denté- cooked but with a slight chew.   They even have dessert options. One is a soup with little flour balls- not so sweet and very floral. The other I've tried is a fried egg white dessert with red bean paste in the middle.  What's always good is they manage to use little oil from what I can see when the food is served. Often times when I go to other dumplings houses the fried pancakes/dumplings are always very greasy- not here! They even cook their regular green veggies with very little oil from what I can see."}
{"text":"A little expensive and can be oily depending on their dish, but overall this is a good northern Chinese restaurant. Green onion pancakes are the best I've had in Toronto and their dumplings are great."}
{"text":"Cream Big Steamed Roll? Salt Detonation Screw Sheet? (google has no idea what this is!) Scalded Cuttlefish? Corn Steamed Bun Palace Irrigation Soup Package?  Reading Golden Harvest Menu is definitely entertaining. I am glad that there are photos for every single item, as who would have guess Irrigation Soup Package = Soup Filled Dumplings?  Lunch Special Weekday till 3 pm..  Selection is decent with entrees, noodles and dumplings. Price point is similar to regular menu but it comes with either a hot and sour soup or soy milk drink.  Braised Beef with Homemade Noodle ($6.55) with Soy Milk - This is where the photo failed me... showing a hot and spicy looking broth... and in reality it is a clear beef broth - Noodle though cooked well with great bite, beef though is A-OK  Afternoon Tea Special from 2:30 - 5:30 with 8 choices starting from $2.99 with either soup/soy milk drink  Fried Dumpling ($2.99) with hot and sour soup - They are freshly made and filled with soup! Really tasty!  Service here is spotty... I arrived close to 3 pm before lunch special cut off time. Waiter kept asking me to hurry and order but forgot to give me the lunch special menu......  Portion is on the smaller size... I was able to finish the lunch and afternoon set in one seating...... no judgement here.. maybe I am just really hungry??!  Sea Food with Floor Ball Soup?!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was a little bit on the salty side. Maybe it's Northern Chinese food in general, but I don't think so as this wasn't the first time I've had Northern Chinese, including in China. I think the chef was just a little heavy handed on the salt the day I came here with family. We ordered a lot of food including dumplings and noodles, but all the food was just a tad too salty for my tastes."}
