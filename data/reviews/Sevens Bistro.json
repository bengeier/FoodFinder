{"text":"The best analogy for this place would be \"Diamond in the rough\". I visited Scottsdale this month, was there for the first time. I was looking for a decent place to have breakfast, came across this gem. Although, I believe others items on the menu would be a slam dunk, I really savored the \"open face egg sandwich\" and \"7s omelette\". Tried their dinner a la carte, and the Basil Pesto chicken was fingerlicious:))"}
{"text":"Awesome experience awesome food! Happen to stop by on friday.. they had live entertainment going on every Friday. Ambiance was great...drinks were priced right and the indian chicken curry was very tasteful and ample quantity as it came with rice and indian bread(naan)."}
{"text":"We we were early birds (a little after 5 p.m. due to a funeral and unusual schedule.) It was attractive, clean, retro and very upscale. Our waiter, Pauley,  was very fun and accommodating, while the food was gourmet quality! My husband had the Char-Grilled Pesto Chicken  with Smashed Rosemary Potatoes, Steamed Broccoli and an exquisite Mustard Cream Sauce. I enjoyed the Blackened Cajun Shrimp with Popcorn Grits, bacon & spinach. We enjoyed wine and talked with the friendly owner as well. We had a very relaxing and wonderful meal after a long, hectic day! Thank you, Sevens Bistro! We'll be back next time we're in the area!"}
{"text":"Great Sunday brunch with an Arcadia/Midtown atmosphere. On an evening when the weather's nice, they'll open up the garage doors that are the south wall of the restaurant. It's a nifty little find in south Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The restaurant is decorated really nice but the food was just average.  Also, they blast terrible club music so it kinda kills the ambiance.  We had an issue with one of our apps and had to send it back.  Although the waiter was really nice and took it off the bill, the manager who seemed to have a bad attitude never bothered to stop by to address it.  We were one of three other tables in the restaurant, I am pretty sure she had time.  Probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I thought this place was closed. I saw they changed the lighting and signage outside so my wife and I decided to give it a try. The inside is comfortable for small tables or larger groups. Decor and ambiance very inviting. The food was delicious.  I had the Cubano, my wife had a burger. It was huge! Both were excellent. They have a small bar also that was pretty well attended. We plan to return. Sounds like the have a good weekend brunch buffet."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Pricey, but worth it. Got seated right away.

Server Danny was fun and joked around. The chef came out and spoke with us. We had a really good time."}
{"text":"Cool place, great menu and the service is excellent. I had the Summer Salad and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"[Would like to give 4.5 stars*] My wife and I loved this place because it had the perfect ambience on the day when we visited.
Nice people, very friendly.
Short and simple - Great place for good taste!"}
{"text":"Went to 7 bistro for happy hour and was not disappointed. Great drinks thanks to our bartender Paulie. Who not only is a great mixologist but a great guy who made our experience  very enjoyable. I highly recommend going for happy hour and taking advantage of happy hour prices and a great bartender."}
{"text":"Came here after a long day of traveling, not really caring where we ate and we stopped here! Our waiter was great so much energy and happy! Husband got the burger and I a salad, both were excellent! Was quite quiet for a Friday night but just what we were looking for! Few Indian dishes that sound amazing to try but overall enough selection on the menu!  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"What a DISAPPOINTMENT !!  About a month ago we had a stellar lunch here. Great food, even better service. Decided to bring friends back with us to give them a treat. My bad.  Our server was perfunctory at best, with an attitude. Dishes came out of the kitchen with no thought - starters were served with mains, items were missing from several plates. Some were inedible (meatballs and lava chicken). It took ages for the food to come out of the kitchen (at a not very busy lunch hour). This happened on our first visit too, but since everything was tasty, and our waiter entertaining we didn't mind. But who wants to wait for bad food and unpleasant service?"}
{"text":"Food is subpar and expensive. Service slow.  New owners are abrasive and downright mean. The only reason to go here is for the music on Friday nights."}
{"text":"Seven's is a gem hiding in plain sight on McDowell and 77th st. I have had breakfast, lunch and dinner here and have enjoyed each meal. The menu is classic bistro food and the burgers and frites are superb. Decor is warm and inviting and the wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Highly recommend Seven's"}
{"text":"Went to Sevens'  for happy hour one Friday evening. Very nice setting. To bad it is on McDowell Rd. We had a few of the starters. The Garlic Grilled Veg Platter,  everything was cooked well and had good flavor.  The Satay Trio  very good, I will get them again.  The Duck Sliders  fabulous  best sliders I have ever had.  Finished it off with a slice of German Chocolate cake.  A bit dry but had good flavor.  We certainly will be going back.  Looking forward to trying the breakfast."}
{"text":"We should have known we would have a horrible time upon arriving. The fact that the place was nearly empty on a Friday night was a red flag, yet we gave Sevens a chance anyway.

Our waiter was nice, helpful, and friendly, BUT one of the owners is VERY unprofessional and treated my party rudely. Dinner was uncomfortable. Our poor waiter kept being interrupted by the owner as well as other staff members while he was trying to serve us, and the food took forever.

To make matters worse, when the food did arrive, it was a huge disappointment. The food is mediocre and the quality questionable. The fish curry tasted like it had been previously frozen, and the tandoori chicken just tasted like simple grilled chicken. The rice tasted like it had been microwaved. It did not seem fresh at all. I don't understand why it took so long for the food to arrive, since it seems like they are just microwaving meals in the back.

The \"spicy\" curry was not spicy at all. Portion sizes are tiny for such a monstrous price. My tea cup looked like it had already been used, but I drank it anyway. Thank GOD there was live music, otherwise it would have been completely awkward, silent, and uncomfortable.

I would not return under any circumstances. If I could give this place -5 stars, I would do so. It feels wrong to even give it one star."}
{"text":"Very nice place highly recommend. We came here for  late afternoon drinks. The serice is great! The food was delicious"}
{"text":"All good meals begin with service. After all, I am not cooking tonight (I am a chef). No one approached me in this semi-deseeted restaurant.  Lost my enthusiasm in the first 2 minutes.  Am currently awaiting late night dinner at Dennys because you suck. Good luck.

{"text":"Love the food. Love the staff. Love the atmosphere. Don't miss Seven's Bistro if you are visiting Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Excellent food, atmosphere and staff with a wide variety of menu selections"}
{"text":"Great staff and owner...took good care of me...burger was very good......great place for breakfast. .....all you can eat for 9$.....can't beat it... come on down!!!"}
{"text":"The music was good, the server was kind and the beer was cold. However, the short ribs were extremely salty and lacked any additional flavor, and the mashers were only so so as well. The strip was over cooked and contained too much fat for the price listed. 
I would not return to this restaurant, the only reason we were stuck going in the first place was because we missed our reservations else where. I may be bias going into it as the manager was a prick earlier in the day when he saw we had a personal beer by the hotel pool. 
Use your own judgement but my boyfriend and I were not fans."}
{"text":"Too Bad....My wife and I had breakfast here a few months ago and it was fantastic. The jalapeno bacon is outstanding. Couldn't wait to try their dinner. Last Sunday, 7 of us went to celebrate my wife's birthday. Again the food was good, however, the service was terrible. Unfortunately there appeared to be not enough wait staff. Plenty of bus staff (who did very little). The waitress did her best but got no support from anyone else. Appetizers came out and we had to ask for plates. Took the bus staffer 5 minutes to find some. We had to ask to have the dishes from the appetizer round removed from the table as the entrees were being brought out. They took away all our silverware and didn't replace it. Had to hunt down someone to give us silverware. Meanwhile there were 2 or 3 bus staff meandering around the restaurant. Asked for tartar sauce for the fish n chips (which are excellent) twice before someone finally brought it.

Don't know if this was just a one time thing but our guess (one of the party had been a waiter for several years) is that this is the way it is. Too bad."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Ordered basil lemon chicken. Too salty even though I like salt. The chicken was dry and tough. We were there for dinner, the day after Easter. The dining room was empty except for one couple besides ourselves. I tried to order bread pudding. The waiter said: \"We don't have any. Yesterday was Easter and we only had one customer all day, so the owner decided not to prepare any bread pudding. He decided not to cook it today also.\" I will never go back and won't recommend Sevens Bistro."}
{"text":"I went to Sevens Bistro with my wife and son for lunch on Friday, 3/9/2016, at around 1:30 PM. First of all, according to the google ad, the place is only open from 2-6PM M-F, which is not true. That might part of the reason the place was empty. It's open from around 10am to 10pm, 7 days a week, so it's also not closed on Saturdays as the google ad says.
That being said, the food was good, but pricey ($13 for a cheeseburger, $15 for a bacon cheeseburger!). I had the shaved prime rib sandwich with provolone cheese, onions and peppers w/ fries and au jus. It was good, but it wasn't $14 good. My wife had the \"half\" (small) chicken Caesar salad, which was $11 (the regular half Caesar salad is $6, so $5 extra for a few pieces of diced chicken- way too much $), and for her, the small salad was plenty large, she couldn't finish it. 
Our 9 yr. old son had the grilled cheese with fries ($6) from the kid's menu, but he didn't like it, probably because he's used to grilled cheese with Kraft American cheese on regular white or wheat bread, and this sandwich had a lot of cheddar cheese and was served on thick sliced bread that should have been toasted more. But I thought the grilled cheese was really, really  good, and that might be the problem- It's more of an adult than a kids' sandwich. The men's bathroom was really nice, though. Overall, it was good, but I thought prices were way too high. Their website menu does list the prices, though."}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfasts - everything from a breakfast burrito to bacon & blueberry pancakes to eggs benedict.  Parking was easy.  I could see getting cozy in the bar for Sunday football.  Very clean, friendly, casual, tasty and reasonable.  In cooler temperatures, they will lift the garage doors for an al fresco / outdoor dining option.  Ample seating, so no need to wait as you do with other Scottsdale eateries.  Good stuff."}
{"text":"I was invited to a late lunch/happy hour at Seven's Bistro.  I was worried it might be a little pricey and snooty.  I was happily surprised at the amazing service and wonderful food.  I have been to Seven's twice.  The first time I had a burger.  I had very specific requests (no bun, salad instead of fries).  The wait staff was very friendly and fast.  They took very good care of our group.  The burger was cooked perfectly and tasted great.  The salad was fresh and delicious and included crisp bacon pieces.   

The second trip to Sevens we had the beef sliders with spicy sauce and a side of Truffle Fries.  The slider bun had a nice buttery crunch and the grilled onions, pickle, and spicy sauce were the perfect compliment to the burger.   meal was the plate of truffle fries.  My friends and I shared a generous side portion of these crispy, crunchy treats.  

I highly recommend Seven's.   It is open and airy.  There are large booths, and small tables that are available both inside and out.  The food is great and the prices are affordable."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch at 11 AM, and had A great Cubana sandwich and grilled salmon sandwich.  I couldn't resist eating some of my husbands peppered french fries. A nice clean place with good service and we truly enjoyed the food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Pros: Nice ambiance, good service and quick preparation. 

Cons: Overpriced. Although the soup and vegetable platter were good, the main curse (a pasta) seemed like a $7 pasta rather than a $14 one. It was just a mix of marinara and pasta and some cheese sprinkled on it."}
{"text":"We ate here for breaksfast and dinner while staying at 3 Palms. Dinner was so so. The chicken and pork chops were cooked well but the food lacked flavor. 
Breakfast was disappointing and the menu was misleading. The fried egg sandwhich said it came with marinated tomatoes and an onion marmalade. In reality, it came with 2 tomato slices and sliced red onion. It wasn't special at all. The only good thing about the breakfast is the $5 off coupon."}
{"text":"Brandon gave great service! Great drinks, fun vibez. Ask for one of his amazing chocolate Martinis!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Classy atmosphere with food that matches. Expensive but quality. Wait staff was friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"When we first walked in the place looked nice but it was completely empty on a Saturday afternoon, this should've been our first clue. After seeing the monkey bread as an appetizer online (which sounded delicious, or so we thought) and looking at pictures we gave it a try before our main meal. The order of monkey bread that we tried to eat was brought to us by a server who didn't seem crazy to be there himself. We finally asked him if this is how it was supposed to look and taste, he agreed that the bread was burned and actually tried to get the bread apart by hitting it on the plate right there at the table! The burger and sandwich we ordered were nothing special, the fries were by far were the best thing we ate which again were nothing special. I think this place has great potential if the owner would hire wait staff that was attentive and didn't make the kitchen look bad when trying to smash burned bread in front of customers. Just a suggestion. There won't be a second round for us at this place, I am stretching by giving it a two star rating!"}
{"text":"Excellent food !! Went for breakfast, loved the frittata and jalapeño bacon. Looked at lunch dinner menu looks tasty!! Will be back next week to try dinner. The owners and chefs attention to detail is evident in the ambience and menu."}
{"text":"I went here recently with my husband and a friend of ours. We all really liked Avalon, which was recently housed in this location, so we were looking forward to trying Sevens'. I can't remember the last time I had an experience this bad at a restaurant in the Valley. It was Saturday night and there were only a few people at the bar and a table full of very drunk and very loud college football fans. 
     We  sat down and ordered a round of drinks and our meals. They have a decent selection of draft beers and cocktails. My friend ordered an italian greyhound and it was just okay. The menu stated the drink had basil in it and it did, but for 9 dollars and for a \"speciality\" drink one would expect a muddle of fresh basil, not a few shakes of dried basil from a jar. After awhile we realized we had waited almost 45 minutes and our food still had not arrived. The table of college football fans had barely just gotten their food. So we waited, the server came over and told us there was a backup in the kitchen and our food would be out soon. So we waited more, not a single plate was coming out of the kitchen. We waited a little more, after about an hour of waiting our food came. I had the jalapeno burger, my husband the cioppino, my friend the short ribs.
    The food was OK, my burger was good, but not definitely not worth the wait. My husband said the seafood in his cioppino was good, but the tomato sauce was really bland and took away from the dish. My friends short ribs looked really sad, she said they were tender but lacked flavor, there was no sauce and the dish was really flat. Her veggies were practically raw. Definitely not worth the 20 dollar price tag. 
  When the server brought our food she acknowledge the long wait and said she notified the owner, who has been sitting at the bar all night. She let us know she was trying to get him to offer a free dessert. Gee, how generous. The biggest disappointment was that the owner/manager never came to speak to us or apologize. He sat at the bar. I understand things happen, but show some professionalism, show your customers you care about their experience. 
   When the server came to clear our plate she let us know if we wanted dessert it would be on the house, almost a non-gesture since the last thing we wanted to do was wait some more. She brought our check and i was taken back by the 82 dollars total. Charging 7 bucks each for a draft beer, wow.
  I really wanted to like this place, it is in such a nice space and has good atmosphere. The mediocre food, poor service and lack of management will keep me away."}
{"text":"I love this place, my girlfriend and I went and had the ribeye Delmonico and the southwestern Burger and they were both amazing!! And Brandon the bar manager, makes the best drinks in Arizona!!!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for a group of 10 for breakfast. I asked them if they were able to go accommodate a large party. We waited and waited for an hour for our food. Finally I went up and asked because we had people who needed to catch their flights. Turns out they hadn't even started our food and they were out of eggs and had to go to the store to get some... we ended up just leaving. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Went here for Happy Hour. 

Interesting drinks and decent happy hour bar food. Service was nice and the place was clean, but I just didn't feel it. I had great company so its not that I was bored or anything, but I just didn't feel it. 

I am not sure I will be a return customer. At least not as a go-to Happy Hour place."}
{"text":"This restaurant was an odd experience. First of all, the Yelp cost rating of 1 $ is not appropriate and somewhat misleading. The entrees on the dinner menu are in the $20-$30 range. 

The atmosphere at the restaurant defies definition. The music playlist bizarrely rambled from disco to Coldplay to the \"Friends\" theme song. The place was almost completely empty and there was only one occupied table other than my party. The decor seems a bit run down, and certain aspects of it were downright unpleasant. The light fixtures over the tables had utensils sitting in them. At the next table over, it looked like the fixture had a coffee cup resting in it. How has the staff missed these things?

The service was moderate and rather disappointing given the cost of the entrees. Nobody was there, yet our food took at least 30 minutes to come out of the kitchen.  The food was  actually quite good and everyone in my party enjoyed their entrees.  The service failing would be acceptable at a lower price point. But given the price of the entrees, the decor and quality of service in this place needs to be addressed."}
{"text":"I had brunch here with a friend today. She ordered a delicious breakfast (wish I could remember what it was called) and I ordered the Ahi Tuna Crunch Salad. The food was delicious! We both cleared out plates!

The service was on point! Even a gentleman opened the door for me! At 10:40 am? Cool.

Our waiters were on top of things. We got our order fast and the drink refills were flowing. 

The atmosphere is contemporary and comfortable. One of the owners even spent some time with us at our table. Really nice guy. He cares deeply about his new restaurant. I hope and pray for its success.

I look forward to coming again with my hubby. I'm still salivating over that salad! And I was eyeballing the burger and their breakfast omelette, and I'm curious about the desserts! Yummy!

Come check this place out! I noticed the 15% discount for Yelpers. Especially cool."}
{"text":"WOW service was bad... That is the waiter was awesome, the kitchen sucked in getting us our food. Although most all the food was good, some was less the good. The cocktails were delish. The restaurant was really beautiful, but strange for the area! I do not think they will be open much longer.... Sad..."}
{"text":"All I can say is Amazing!! Burgers are delicious and cooked perfectly. The chips are incredible .. Crisp and not too salty. Fries are the same. Don't get the reviews that say music too loud and food salty. Not the case. Loved the whole experience! Person I was with said the onion soup was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Based on the old reviews, sounds like the new management completely turned this place around. The steak, potatoes, salmon, carrots, drinks, service, atmosphere.... Everything was so amazing!! Definitely will be returning and you should check it out, too. Really."}
{"text":"Service was very slow. Took forever to get our appetizer so we ended up going somewhere else for dinner. I should also point out we were one of two tables in the restaurant. The other table also ended up leaving. The menu itself looked great, so it is disappointing the service was so bad."}
{"text":"Came in a Saturday afternoon. Not very busy but the owner was nice and attentive. I had the spinach chicken wrap and it was quite tasty. Prices aren't bad either."}
{"text":"I was a little unsure about the location to start, but once you go inside you realize the owners put a lot of heart and soul into their restaurant.  The place looks as nice as any of the high end restaurants in the Scottsdale hub. Their music selection was excellent. The staff was SUPER friendly and professional.  We ended up eating at the bar and enjoyed our experience thoroughly."}
{"text":"We were one of THREE tables in the restaurant, there were two servers on staff, and the service still was incredibly slow; our server disappeared for so long that the other server came to check on us, and we had to ask for our bill. Our server also was pretty rude. We ordered the monkey bread, which was underwhelming. We also ordered the meatballs, and those were good. The decor of the place is gorgeous, but it doesn't make up for the bad service and mediocre food."}

{"text":"Went out to lunch with a couple friends and arrived a little after 11am we pretty much had the place to ourselves. The decor was tasteful and everything was clean with very nice jazzy? music playing in the background. Our waiter, Pauley, was very helpful in answering any of our questions and was able to meet our needs quite nicely (one example, they didn't have half and half for the coffee so he brought us a couple creamers with milk and one with heavy cream to make our own.) The food was delicious! I had gotten the Western burger with sweet potato fries that was to die for (especially when using their southwestern sauce for dipping) and the price fairly reasonable, especially for Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot. I was pleasantly surprised going in the place, it was very upscale and nice inside, without being stuffy. Kind of a lounge feel. Food was pretty good, there were a few hiccups, but they had just opened. I look forward to trying it again, as SoSco needs more great indie spots.

Support small business!"}
{"text":"Seven's bistro is a beautiful restaurant with a great atmosphere. Loved the music and loved the interior design. I did not expect such a nice restaurant in this part of town. The food, although not the best I have had, was good. I had lunch here but I would recommend it for dinner with a big group of friends. A little pricier than I would have liked but it was more of a dinner menu.   I recommend it"}
{"text":"I found my favorite place to take the family out . Nice and beautiful done and centrally located . 

Excellent drinks and staff is amazing service . I am big fan the pork Cuban sandwich . Loved it Loved it !!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to two events at Sevens now and have really enjoyed both nights.  I have had some really great service and food here too. 

I recommend the curry and steaks are great and I have no complaints. 

The prices for food, drinks and even happy hours are actually very reasonable.  Check happy hours as they seem to change.  Last time it was until 8pm which they honour just after and allow you to stock up! 

As a venue this place has a large bar, modern style inside and very friendly staff. 

They have a patio where the dance floor or tables can spill out into and plenty of comfortable seating areas around the restaurant. 

Both venues I have been to have been fun and not over populated or crowded."}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me so long to discover this place! This place kicks ass! I ran by this place every day for a year and always wondered what was going on... well, let me tell you - this place is worth the visit. The food is amazing, the staff is friendly, the atmosphere is superb and it is just all around enjoyable. Two thumbs up. My only minor, minor wish would be that the menu would have more options - but what they do have is magnificent!"}
{"text":"Super friendly bartender and delicious food. I had the cream of celery soup which was perfectly light and not *too* creamy and the summer salad which was delicious. Order the smaller portions because damn, they're big. I couldn't finish either. Pleasantly surprised by this restaurant that I honestly only went to because it was next door to my hotel."}
{"text":"Had dinner there quite awhile ago and just never got around to writing a review. But have to say the food was excellent. A little pricey... $26 for a pork chop. But my son who is a very picky eater loved it. The shrimp appetizer was delicious. The service was great and overall experience very nice. Also the bar by the pool at the hotel which is also part of Sevens Bistro very nice. Bartender was great! Owners son I believe.
.polite, and great service."}
{"text":"Came for Sunday Brunch last weekend to start off my Sunday Funday. The Garden Eggs Benedict and Meat Lovers Eggs Benedict were GREAT! But the hash browns were drastically overcooked and crunchy like potato chips! Kitchen staff & Serving staff NEEDS to pay more attention to Quality...seriously, the waitress should have seen that they were practically burnt.

I'll give this place another shot and Rate It Again later..."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Monday around 6pm. The place was empty. We were quickly seated by a very friendly hostess who also was our sever. We ordered water to drink and she kept our glasses full. I had the Grilled Tandoori Chicken. I received two breasts that were grilled and seasoned. They were VERY moist and juicy. They were served with a yellow rice, summer squashes, and warm naan. The meal was fantastic. The portion was large, all the food was fresh, and it was so tasty. My dining companion got the Asian Stir Fry and subbed steak for the normal tofu. She also ordered it without chili flakes, and they were happy to make her special order. This was served in a large bowl with a pile of rice noodles, veggies, steak, and sauce. It was also fantastic. The steak was cooked perfectly, the veggies were crisp tender, and the noodles were al-dente. We enjoyed EVERY single bite."}
{"text":"What a wonderful breath of fresh air! 
This classy, airy restaurant - with a full bar - has a surprisingly creative menu! 

The atmosphere seems to sparkle - the service is superb, menu uniquely diverse (Southwest Burger is delicious!), and the place is absolutely spotless!  

We discovered Seven's Bistro when Jeordie was hosting an Open Mic Jam and have fallen in love with it! 

We will be back again & again! 

Many kudos to the owners!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent steakhouse burger, perfectly cooked shoestring potatoes, and excellent service. But I can't get past the atmosphere. Weird.."}
{"text":"This place was soooo good last night, we will go back for lunch today! Talk about impressive. The decor was retro-rat-pack vibe without the smokey room (gorgeous!), and the food, service and entertainment was top notch. The architecture outside an inside is very well planned and appointed. They didn't try to cram in a ton of tables to make every blood red cent possible. Nice-looking glass garage door style patio doors that they can open in nice weather. We will be back for that!

Happened to get there at about 7 pm on Fri night and was delighted that happy hour is from 6-8 pm. We got to pick any table we wanted and the two of us snugged up in a gigantic round hipster booth. Margaritas for $4 during happy hour were on point. I had Cubana sandwich with onion rings, both incredibly yummy. My man had 'make your own burger' with crispy fries, which he really liked very much. There were so many really good sounding items on the menu, I just need to go back, pronto! I wanted to get the curry with chicken or shrimp but the Cubano sandwich called out to me a bit louder. Our waiter mentioned that the owners are East Indian, so I'm betting that curry is really ordered a lot, as the waiter said. There was also another Indian dish or two on the menu as well as some fantastic sounding steak dishes. 

Back to my cubano sandwich. It was the best I'd ever eaten. The meat was real roast beef with ham, and not just lunch meat style. The flavors were perfect, with a kick but not too intense. Yum!

Our waiter was attentive but not looming, and they had three live bands there, all with their originally written tunes. It was fun! One of the singers sang a song I just can't get out of my head. It was adorable and fun, and goes like this, \"I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, girl. I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad, girl! Chorus: Spanky, spanky, spanky, spanky, spanky spank. Spank my derrière! I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad girl. ... I'm so bad, I'm goooooood.\"

I gotta finish this review so we can get ready and drive on over there for lunch!! See you there!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly very good spot for breakfast! We were poking around Yelp, looking for a place out the Old Town chaos, and realized we had never been to Seven's Bistro so we gave it a try.  They had a very unique menu for breakfast, and tons of vegetarian options. I have to mention that their coffee was particularly delicious as well. I had a breakfast combo with jalapeño cheese sauce and corn on my eggs... mmmmm! Then we split a single order of their lemon ricotta pancake... next time I might just order one of those, it was awesome...almost more on the savory side. We will definitely be back for breakfast and I would even like to give their happy hour a try too. Their menu looks great!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my meals here. I stayed in the adjacent hotel and frequented Seven's Bistro a few times. The owners are nice folks, and are just starting it up. It was dead during the day but livened up in the evening, featuring live music on the weekends. They have a full service bar, cheap drinks and great food. The interior and exterior are clean and have a nice modern- vibe to it. I figure not to many folks know about it yet, but it's worth the try! This place could easily become a poppin' hang out spot in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I flew in from
Seattle today and are staying at the 3 palms for the night. We wanted a chill place to sit and have a few beers and wandered into this establishment. The place is clean and beautifully decorated and we were quickly greeted by Philly who was working the bar on this fine evening. He was extremely friendly and genuine as he guided us through the food menu and gave us information on where we should visit in the area. It was a rough start to the day for us but he turned it around and we had a great time chatting with him. Didn't end up trying the food but it looks pretty delicious. Thank you Philly!"}

My salmon was delicious but for $26 I would have liked more than five tiny pieces of broccoli. Big restaurant but we were one of two couples inside. Now I know why"}
{"text":"First experience started by sitting down with the Executive Chef and planning out our companies Christmas party. He planned a custom menu for our group of 50+ (at an incredible price I might add). Night of the party we arrived with the appetizers waiting for us, the bruchetta was amazing as was the veggie egg rolls. After a few cocktails, the staff seamlessly replaced the appetizers with an amazing main course. Prime rib, salmon and veggie lasagna all was incredible!  Our glasses never went dry and there was never a dirty plate in front of you, the service was impeccable! I would recommend to anyone and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Been there twice and the food has been really good so far. The first visit we had the hot wings which were delicious and my boyfriend had the frittata which he really enjoyed. The second time we went we had the breakfast buffet. They had the best biscuits and gravy I've had in a long time! The eggs, sausage and potatoes were all so yummy! This is definitely going to be one of our frequent breakfast spots from now on."}
{"text":"It's a beautifaul space in an unsuspecting place. I have heard breakfast is wonderful. The pleasent staff, and owner want to make sure you enjoy the new restaurant.
TB"}
{"text":"My friend and I had lunch here and I was really surprised at how wonderful the food was! It's definitely a hidden gem for lunch!
I had the shrimp po' boy with sweet potato fries and it was done perfectly. My friend had the curry and that was delicious as well. Even the rice tasted wonderful... We also tried the shrimp lettuce wraps--they were really really good--even the sauce on the wraps was  perfect. Topped with a glass of wine from their full bar and it was a great lunchtime spot in old Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We had a very enjoyable dinner last night with a gorgeous sunset off the patio. Keith and Kyle were great and very helpful with the menu. I had the short ribs $20 very good and my wife had the lemon basil chicken $16 OK, no basil and good calamari ($5 during H/Hour) The sides of grilled vegetables were some of the best and crispiest we have ever had. We presented the local dines coupon for $30 and not a hesitation from Keith. Some restaurants have so many restrictions that it ends up not worth it. Very nice Hess Select Chard for H/H $5. Good spot, good location!
Sorry Melissa, we went to Avalon twice and both times the food was overpriced, the staff was very pretentious, and acted like the customer was an after thought. I knew they would not last long with their poor attitude.
This is also a great breakfast restaurant. The eggs benedict with jalapeno bacon is excellent. My wife and I will be back again!"}
{"text":"We have had breakfast and now dinner there last night. They have great service and food. I hope they stay busy there and maybe open a location in north Scottsdale. I had the short rib dinner, so good.  The waitstaff and managers were attentive and nice. Go there bring friends and have a beer."}
{"text":"Music/ambiance is great, servers are friendly & know their stuff & the food is delicious! Monkey bread, roasted veggie/hummus tray, salads & dinners are all yummy! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went to celebrate Valentine's Day yesterday as some of our friends highly recommended this place and they have nice valentine special package.. 
I have to say the ambience, decor was perfect for valentines.. and to top it off there was live singer and musician! I couldn't have imagined my night any better! 
Something about the environment was so romantic and soothing! 
Anyway food was amazing! Our waiter was very courteous ...
We will go back for sure as I heard they have live events every Friday and Saturday!"}
{"text":"I loved the decor of Avalon so much that I was really happy to see another restaurant take over the space.  So when the unthinkable happened and my husband took a day off of work to spend with me, I picked Sevens for breakfast.  With the exception of one other table, we had the restaurant to ourselves.  I was surprised to see a bartender at 10 am on a Monday morning, so my husband put him to work with a Bloody Mary which received high marks.  I talked myself out of a mimosa and was glad I did because my orange juice was not only not fresh squeezed, it tasted like concentrate.  

As much as I wanted Sevens to be my favorite breakfast spot, it needs a little work.  I like crispy hash browns, but these were so overdone there was no sense of a potato left.  But our main complaint was the level of salt used.  My husband ordered the Meat Lovers Benedict and instantly commented it was too salty.  Well, with jalapeno bacon, canadian bacon, and prosciutto, I thought it was somewhat understandable, but the egg and hollandaise should have balanced it out a little.  With my own breakfast, I would discover the problem with his...the pork green chili.

I ordered a breakfast burrito described as filled with \"eggs, hash browns, italian sausage, and cheese, drenched with green pork chili and topped with shredded cheese\".  Actually the chili was inside the burrito, so I'm completely not understanding the sausage (I substituted bacon).  And there was no shredded cheese on top, instead it  was their jalapeno cheese sauce.  I liked the sauce, but I think a dish ought to be prepared as described on the menu.  But the problem again was that it was salty to the point that a lesser eater would not have gotten it down.  Upon tasting the components, hash browns really salty.  Bacon exceptionally salty, even for bacon.  Green chili over the top salty.  Had this been served alone, I would have actually sent it back and ordered something else, and that's something I never do.  But I had a $20 gift certificate, so I didn't complain since we were really only paying for drinks.

For the good.  The menu is perfect in my book for breakfast with a nice combination of savory and sweet dishes, and some southwest items tossed in the mix.  The lemon ricotta pancakes almost had me, and I would still love to try them.  The service was excellent.  All the staff was friendly.  Our server was attentive.  You couldn't ask for more there.   And the prices are really good.  Most breakfast dishes $7-$8, nothing over $9.  I just don't know that I want to consume a week's worth of sodium in one meal again.  But I might be persuaded to come back for dinner when there might be another chef."}
{"text":"One of the top contenders for worst dining experience in my life. 
Ordered the salmon and was given a thin, grayish slab of steak instead, rested atop a bed of bland, soggy, unseasoned broccoli. It came with a roasted grape and mushroom risotto cake which also came out soggy.
I didn't complain because based on how unappealing the steak looked, I could only imagine how disappointing the salmon could be. Despite my best effort I couldn't eat even half of the meal since it was so unappetizing. I get the feeling they only buy the \"Manager's Special,\" semi-spoiled cuts of meat from the Fry's across the street at this place...
Staff was friendly, but short-handed. I felt bad for the bartender, seemed like he was doing all the work. Cool atmosphere and good drinks, but I wouldn't suggest you eat here."}
{"text":"Went and got a burger and rueben sandwich. The service and food were great. You should try it"}
{"text":"Phenomenal!!  It is my daughter's birthday and she selected Sevens' bistro as she had eaten there last week and had a great experience.  Upon arriving I wasn't too sure of her restaurant selection but any preconceived thoughts were quickly abandoned after we walked through the double glass doors.  

The decor is beautiful and the ambience incredible (can't wait to do a date night). We were quickly seated in a comfortable, roomy booth.  Our server, Steven, was on top of his game, while not being invasive.  We never lacked for anything - our water glasses were unobtrusively refilled and the flow between courses was perfect!  The wine and beverage selection is very good and the wine was at a reduced price during happy hour.  I definitely want to experience some of the specialty drinks at my next visit (when I am not driving) especially the Le Poir and Mandarin Caliente.

We started our evening with an appetizer - Warm Spinach and Artichoke dip with seasoned flat bread.  I've had this at many restaurants and none come close to the taste and texture of this wonderful starter.  The entrees, after much indecision, I selected the Braised Short Ribs (also at the recommendation of Steven) with garlic mash potatoes and grilled veggies.  The portions were generous and I am looking forward to leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  My daughter had the Enraged Papardelle Pasta which had the perfect blend of flavors and just the right amount of spice.

As it was a special occasion, we selected for desert the Bistro Cookie for Two.  This was a delicious, warmed chocolate chip cookie with ice cream and drizzled with caramel, chocolate and a slight sprinkling of powdered sugar.  I've had these deserts before at a few local restaurants but none compare with Sevens' bistro.  As it was a public place, and I wanted to return soon, I held back from licking the dish.  It is that good!!!!!!!!!

The best surprise was when I received the bill and this entire meal, for two, was less than $60.  This is a new restaurant and it's one, of few in the valley that delivers perfection at every step."}
{"text":"Great environment, accommodating service,and amazing food. This place is one of my new favorite spots. Go see Rob at the bar. He is a mix master."}
{"text":"We ate 2 breakfasts and 1 dinner and watched an NFL game here, and, overall, this is a very nice restaurant. 

There are a few hiccups in service, poured us lukewarm coffee from the breakfast buffet, for example, but the food is pretty darn good here. The bruschetta plate is fantastic. 

Nice people, very friendly, and good food. 

4 stars."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  I had the Ruben.  Not as good as you would get at say Thirsty Lion or Robbie Fox's (which is a corned beef sandwich not a Ruben) but still quite good. Shoe string fries were awesome.  My buddy got one of the burgers, and I forget which one, but he said it was awesome."}
{"text":"Great place! Love the burgers and if you like wedge salads you'll love theirs! It's amazingly good!"}
{"text":"We went for Valentine's Day and our food took 1 hour 15 minutes just to get our appetizer. It did not look like the pictures and it was very dry so I ask for balsamic or oil and was brought salad dressing.  Our meal came with wine. I had to send it back because the smell was really stale. They did not have a wine list so it was all \"house\". We received our meal but I had to flag down the waiter for water. The atmosphere is beautiful but they had a live singer and she was really loud and it was the same loop for as long as we were there. Over 2 hours. I guess the worst part is around 1:00 in the morning both my husband I got sick."}
{"text":"AMAZING! We went for breakfast and 5 of us at the table - some selected the french toast which had very fresh berries, others chose an omelete, and I chose the breakfast burrito. The burrito was the talk of the table, lucky me. I thought everything was delicious and have already suggested Sevens' to others."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to have a drink and great food. The staff is wonderful and willing to strike up a conversation. My burger was cooked to perfection. I will look forward to coming here time and again. I couldn't ask for a better dining experience."}
{"text":"I think it is great for a restaurant to offer comfort foods for three meals a day.  Sevens seems to be this type of establishment where you can come in for a Bloody Mary and Eggs Benedict in the morning, and be back later that night for Miso Glazed Salmon and a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.  Furthermore, during Happy Hour (every day from 3p-6:30p) there is $2 off all glasses of wine, beer, and specialty cocktails) and 1/2 off selected appetizers.  Great opportunity to sample an Italian Greyhound or a Cucumber Gimlet, for $7.

The ambiance is sexy, modern, clean, earthy, and overall just a great space - battling against a not so great location.

I had lunch here and have to be honest in saying that I was not overly impressed.  Spinach and Artichoke dip, alongside the Caprese Grilled Cheese and fries was good but nothing memorable.  The dip was lackluster, the grilled cheese just average.  Perhaps other items on the menu, such as the breakfast options, are fantastic.  But I strongly feel that if you are going to offer dishes to your patrons that they can get any pub, sports bar, or franchise, make yours memorable.

For lunch hour on a Tuesday we were one of three tables.  The service was nice, but considering the restaurant was not busy and we were a very laid back table - I truly feel we could have received some extra attention.  I strongly encourage businesses to offer the complete package when it comes to the dining experience.  If the service was memorable I may be open to coming back and trying out the breakfast menu, but I am usually not that discerning.  Unfortunately, the food I did have lacked the wow factor."}
{"text":"Delicious! We had the Cubano and a French dip, both were delectable! Fresh and plated beautifully! Yummiest french fries ever! Finished with the triple chocolate brownie which was scrumptious. Great friendly service and ambiance.  We had leftovers for the next day which I am enjoying now. Try this place out. It won't disappoint you!"}
{"text":"Fabulous Ginger Miso Grilled Salmon!!! Great staff as well"}
{"text":"Very nice.  I'm thinking this is similar to Vig, St. Francis, Windsor or Postinos in terms of fare, decor, and menu design, but without the hype, crowd or pretentiousness of that group of been-there done-that restaurants.

Party of seven on a Sunday night.  We were the ONLY group in there other than a few people at the well-stocked bar.  Our server was an attractive young lady who never bothered us too much, but still provided the perfect level of service.  Between the seven of us, we sampled a good number of the appetizers/sides (monkey bread, mussels, mac'n'cheese, french onion soup) and entrees (short ribs, osso buco, salmon, skirt steak) and then I went into \"fly on the wall\" mode and listened to the following sorts of comments:

\"Great portions, these short ribs are HUGE.....pork cooked extremely well to a delicate tenderness with wonderful oozing marrow....skirt steak seasoned nicely and cooked dead-on medium rare, monkey bread nice but pretty ordinary, mussels were tasty but sauce was a bit too cool temperature wise....both red and white sangrias were great and a real value at $5.00....really liked the draft beer selection, as well as the unusual selection of bombers (such as Figueroa Mountain Red Lager)....gosh, our server sure is nice and pleasant, she is helpful.....wine list is A-OK, nothing to get too excited about but it has something for everyone.....this lighting is perfect for dinner, good colors all around.....there's something just a bit weird about the location, being in what feels like a hotel parking lot....interior is nice but the 'curb appeal' is definitely hurting this place....it is pretty kid friendly......\"

So, having taken the pulse of general reaction in our party of seven, I'd say I have to agree with the consensus here:  The food isn't perfect, but it more than holds its own against the other restaurants of similar design and style in Phoenix, and the service is BETTER than the aforementioned trendy places.  The price is right for this level of food and service, I would even say that is is a better-than-average value.  The location is a bit out of the way for me, but still within easy reach on any weekend night.  

I'd go there again without hesitation, and recommend it to just about anybody."}
{"text":"The staff was amazing and the food delicious.  Shane was the greatest bartender, and the manager I can't remember his name at night but he was amazing.  You don't want to leave because you feel like you are old friends with all of them.  The food, I ate breakfast, lunch, and dinner while I was in town.  All three delicious, burgers, veggies, hummus, you really can't go wrong with anything you order.  At the bar, order the Lemon Drop.. by far the best one I have ever had, and I'm kind of of drunken expert on them. Oh yeah, and they are so prettiest Lemon Drops I've ever seen (inside joke)!! If you are in Scottdale stop by you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Went today at 7 pm and it was completely empty!  We were afraid that this place would be bad.  Boy was it NOT.  Although it was a Monday I couldn't understand why this place with a great modern ambiance, great service, and awesome food was so dead.  The bartender/host/waiter man was simply the best.  Friendly, attentive and overall just caring.  Maybe because we were the only ones in there but he could've easily tried to hustle us out of there.  He treated us like a king and queen and went the extra step to give us a great dining experience.  The chef cooked great food also.  We got a meal, a salad, and an appetizer to mix it up and they were all top notch tasty!  The extra dessert he presented to us was  beautiful also!  We will return when they have some live music as they said they did on other nights but right now it's our hidden gem!!  Hope they stick around because they do have something good going on!!"}
{"text":"Ok, first off, the deco in here is VERY cool. I want to steal a few ideas for my own house. The color scheme and fixtures are so modern and complimentary...and great choice of dinner music.

The place was DEAD. And I mean DEAD on a Sunday night at 6:30pm, which I thought was weird. Not sure if it's new and they are still drawing attention to their location? 

The food was ok. The chicken and rice we got was dry and the penne rosa was swimming in sauce...like I literally could not find my penne under the sauce at times, but the flavor was good...just needed less sauce! 

The service was fantastic and friendly and we enjoyed chatting with our server. Might be interested in coming back, maybe it was just an off night?

Again, the decor is top notch."}
{"text":"Excellent food at great prices. Very inviting atmosphere and awesome service. and it's become my husband and mine favorite place to eat!  We've been a dozen times and never disappointed.  Love love love this place! Would highly recommend to couples or families or even groups. Outside patio and very tastefully decorated interior. So pleasant and low key with the friendly fast servers is enough excuse but the exceptional food takes it up to a new level. Tried almost everything on the menu but the breakfast is our favorite and hard to beat anywhere in the valley at their low prices. You have to experience Seven's Bistro. A real local gem!"}
{"text":"I went here off of the reviews of this yelp page expecting an amazing  dinner, but sadly that was not the case. I entered to a ghost town of a restaurant on a Friday night. I thought well maybe it was not packed because it was closer to closing time. I looked at the prices and were shocked, but then i thought well this must be one hell of a meal. Not the case. i was served my sandwich and to my surprise the meat was very dry and very bland. It had absolutely no flavor. i felt like i was cheated out of $15. My partner had a burger that was just a basic burger that they were pricing at $14. What a rip off. I would never recommend this place."}
{"text":"Had the bacon wrapped prawn and rib eye steak. They were delicious, the star was sooo render and juicy.  The meal was to die for. You gotta eat here."}
{"text":"My sister and I ate lunch here today after seeing a deal for it on Local Dines.  Walking in, the decor and ambiance was great-- like any high end restaurant you will find in Scottsdale.  The staff was extremely nice when we entered, they opened the doors when anyone came in or left, and kindly greeted us! 
We are huge fans of Spinach Artichoke Dip, so we knew we wanted to try it at Sevens'.  My sister and I couldn't decide on breakfast or lunch, so we got both! We ordered the Lemon Ricotta pancakes and Sevens' Bistro Burger, alongside the dip.
The dip came out first.  Great presentation and it smelt so so good!  We quickly decided that it was the BEST Spinach Artichoke dip we have ever had-- and we order it almost everywhere we go.  It is a MUST TRY at Sevens'. 
The pancakes were so light and fluffy, and the lemon syrup was delicious.  I love pancakes, so I ate every last bit.
The burger was cooked perfectly and the butter bun was nice and crisp!  The truffle fries we ordered on the side were crunchy and just right!  

Overall, great experience.  The owner was there, and he spoke with us briefly about the restaurant.  You can tell he has put a lot of time and heart into it, to ensure that guests enjoy their food and experience!  He commented that none of the foods are ever frozen, and brought in fresh almost daily-- which is very important to me when choosing a restaurant.  
This is a must try restaurant if you are in the Scottsdale area!"}
{"text":"Seven' Bistro opening is like God's gift to my 2012.  It's a brief walk down the greenbelt from my house, they're open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and the menu looks great - and priced to rock my socks.

The boyfriend and I grabbed lunch yesterday, and as always when I'm picking the place, I'm nervous.  He's worked in the industry and can be snobby when he sees that things aren't done right.  Thankfully, even though Sevens' has only been open a week and a half, he had no complaints!  In fact, he loved it as much as I did.

I ordered the Caprese Grilled Cheese (vegetarian here) and upgraded to the Truffle Fries.  The sandwich was great - even better than I expected.  And the truffle fries? HOT DAMN they were good!  The only downside couldn't be helped by the staff - once the bf got a taste of them, they were suddenly \"our\" fries.  He ordered the Duck Sliders, and must have been thrilled - he devoured them faster than I've seen him eat most things.  The house-made potato chips came with it, and they were good, just nowhere near the Truffle Fries.

As a boozy beverage guru, he chatted it up with the bartender, Noah (who is awesomely unpretentious and oodles of fun), and ordered the Le Poir.  From my little knowledge of beverages, I'm fairly certain it's essentially a pear martini.  It was refreshing, smooth, and utterly delicious.  The kind of drink that will make me grateful I can walk/stumble home.

On top of the outstanding food, beverage, and service, the decor make me tingle.  It's not over the top or grandiose, but it is simple and beautiful.  A quick swap of the plastic plants for real plants, improving the chalkboard artistry, and shazzam - perfection!

I'm looking forward to many more meals here... I can nearly taste the veggie eggs benedict now."}
{"text":"The inside is beautifully done! It's brand spankin' new so don't be surprised if you're the only one there.

I had the Bistro Burger, and it was cooked perfectly. So many times you order a burger medium and it comes out WELL DONE. Not here. The cajun fries are amazing as a side.

$10 burger $5 glass of wine (happy hour). Can't beat that in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Met a friend here for lunch and a meeting today. Found it thanks to my friends  here on Yelp!
We got there super early for lunch (11) and were the only table for quite some time - I noticed a few people came and went from the bar, but not a lot. That has nothing to do with my review, other than I'm shocked how few clients they had for the lunch hour (although I don't know that there are any businesses nearby).

I had the Summer Salad which was SO good - the smaller size is the perfect portion. I didn't notice if there was an option to add a protein, but I'll bet that it would terr terrific with grilled chicken or shrimp. My lunch companion had the Spinach Wrap which she said was tasty. It was HUGE, so she did not eat the salad that came with it (it really did seem like a lot of food).

We were there for a meeting, so stayed for about 3 hours so that we didn't have to 'do' anything while we ate. The staff was friendly and kept our water/Dt Coke glasses full, yet realized that we were there for a purpose so they were 'stand back' enough that we neither felt rushed nor did we feel ignored.

I would definitely go again. Food and staff were great, the decor was really nice. I hope that they have a better Happy Hour/evening business, because the Monday lunch business wasn't much!"}
{"text":"My sister and I came here the morning after a night out in Scottsdale. The menu had so many amazing options that we couldn't each settle on one, so we shared the classic eggs Benedict, stuffed French Toast with raspberries, and the blue berry bacon pancakes. The eggs were perfectly poached, the pancakes were HUGE, fluffy, and delicious, and the French toast was beyond words- the cream cheese filling with the raspberries had a touch of lemon that made this one of the best things I've ever eaten. 

The ambiance was cool and nicely dimmed with great decor and comfortable seating. The hostess and our waiter were very nice and helpful. Our food arrived quickly and we never had to ask for coffee or water refills. 

We were so impressed that we asked to see the lunch and dinner menus to plan our next trip here. Sevens truly has everything I look for in a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Had a few drinks and sone apps. The place is nice and the service was really good.  I would like to come back and try the menu.  Based on the lettuce cups appetizer I'm sure the menu will be good!"}
{"text":"If you know me at all...  You know I don't like to waste your time writing extensive reviews.  I'm just not attention-needy enough to force you to keep reading, reading, and reading about my opinions.  

So here you go...

The biscuits and gravy were a little dry.  But unless you're having B&G in the South, it will never be the best!  So it's a pass. 

The meat-lovers Benedict was great.  Try it.

DEFINITELY go here for brunch and get the Breakfast Burrito.  The BEST I've ever had!  Just do it!  In fact, get off your freaking computer, drive here IMMEDIATELY and get the Breakfast Burrito.  NOW!  

You don't even have to thank me."}
{"text":"Great food but terrible service at Lunch. They usually only have one waitress. I would keep coming for the food but of the three times I have gone you wait at least 5 minutes to even order a drink. Hopefully they fix the staffing issue soon it is a shame."}
{"text":"We had the Pleasure to eat at this Fantastic Resturant 3 times while my husband and I visted the Scottsdale area. 

The 1st time was last Saturday Night. Kyle was our helpful waiter. Lots of advice on the menu and drinks.: ) My husband ordered a Box Car and I ordered a Bellini. Very Pleasing cocktails! We ordered some of the best starters I have EVER had. The DUCK SLIDERS & the LAVA CHICKEN. For Dinner my husband had the Jalapeno Burger and I had Chopped Salad. They were Delightful.We also had a opportunity to speak to the owner Bryan. Very personable and humble guy : )

2nd Time was Sunday Morning ( we were staying across the way at the 3 Palms Resort, so acess to such a Wonderful Eatery Was Sooooo Great!) Brandon took care of us that morning. A Fun upbeat fellow. I had a Fresh Mimosa w/ my RAGE HASH... I really enjoyed the layers of flavors in the dish. My Man had the Classic Benedict. He said  it was excellent w/ a perfect Hollandaise Sauce.

3rd Time we headed in before we had to head home the next day. We decided to have a Patron and Beer at the Bar. We met friendly and Basketball smarty Shane. We ordered more.... LAVA CHICKEN. We were Happy Campers.

So, in closing... We Will be back to this Splendid Place next time we are in town."}
{"text":"The owner was so rude to me and my friends. I will never go back and never recommend this place to anyone!!!

It is very slow there and assuming for a reason. 

The staff was great, but I can't support a business where the owner is ungrateful for business that walks through his door.  

My friends and I met there for a business meeting. We didn't require anything special other than three tables. We got drinks and appetizers. The owner then got angry that we didn't spend enough money there. Not a thank you or anything!  I told him I would never step foot in his place again."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time the other night and was surprised to see this type of decor on McDowell, as it looks like it should be in Old Town.
Aside from the looks, I thought our waiter was very nice and very accommodating.  Between the three of us we had the Cioppino, Salmon & Jalapeno Burger.  Everyone seemed to enjoy there meal and I could easily recommend this for most to try.
I did think the prices were a little high and we were one of only three occupied tables, so the place was almost empty."}
{"text":"The place is under new management. Wasn't sure at first because of old reviews. Had the ribeye and it was delicious! My daughter had the kids chicken tenders and she loved it!! She also enjoyed some of the ribeye and keep saying this place is nice!! I agree and we will be back!!"}
{"text":"I want to be able to give this more stars, I really do. But both times I have gone, with different people each time, both times my companies food was overcooked and tough. 
Both times someone opened the door for us, ambiance is killer. LOVE the decor and ambiance and the music. I have gotten a jalapeno burger (not as much flavor as I expected but still was good) the tomato bisque soup (a 10!) and iceberg salad. Very good. But my company the first time in ordered the prime rib sandwich and wings to go. The sandwich he loved, the wings he couldnt eat. They were flavorless and hard. My second time in, my company also ordered the prime rib sandwich at my recommendation. It was tough. He didnt even eat half. However when the waiter asked how our meals were and we told him the sandwich was tough he did apologize and removed it from the bill. The staff has been friendly both times. If the food could be more consistent they will do better. Id also like to see a good happy hour. I will give it another try, their menu has variety enough to get me back"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst restaurant experience that I have ever encountered so far. I've driven by Sevens' plenty of times before they opened, looked them up online and was excited to try them out. Their menu looked really good and tasty. I finally got around to having dinner there this past weekend. The menu you see on their website for lunch & dinner is not what you'll see when you go in. Online, they combine both their lunch and dinner menus making it appear larger. But when we were there on a Friday night around 7, we were only given the dinner menu which was about half the size. Now that I'm looking at their menu online, the prices are also not accurate. It's probably because they're showing the lunch prices which are typically lower.

When we arrived, it was dead. There were a few people at the bar and two other tables. We were seated inside the restaurant close to the patio. They had the patio doors open making it way too cold. Some heat lamps were definitely needed. Good thing I wore a leather jacket. The restaurant is really well decorated, clean, and modern. I didn't see what it used to look like as Avalon so I don't know how much they remodeled. We were greeted and seated right away.

We got the monkey bread and spinach and artichoke dip to start for 5 of us. The monkey bread was raw. At first we thought it was gooey cheese, no it was raw dough. Bleh! We told the waiter and he took it away and later brought us out a new one. The new one was clearly burnt. I didn't even bother trying it. The small piece of the first one I had was okay. Tasted similar to Red Lobster's cheesey biscuits with some honey. I thought it was supposed to have garlic butter? The spinach and artichoke dip came out on a huge plate. However, there were probably 8 wedges of pita to go with it. The dip was edible but way too garlicy. There needs to be more pita for the proportion of dip though. 

My boyfriend and I got the duck sliders to split and the lemon basil chicken. Other people got burgers, duck sliders, and french onion soup. The duck sliders were okay. I took the onion, cilantro, jalapeno off because I don't like them. We also asked for the spicy mayo sauce to be on the side. Good thing we asked if it came with a sauce since it didnt' say on the menu. If your familiar with those pork buns you can get at he Asian Bakeries for $2, that's pretty much what it tasted like. Good but not worth $12. My boyfriend at the sandwich with the condiments on it and said that it didn't go well together at all. The chips are those kinds you get at the fair. However, just looking at them, you can tell that they were drenched in the cooking oil. They were so soggy and flimsy. How did the cook see that and think it looked appetizing? Another person got the duck sliders which came out 15 minutes later for some reason and the chips were just as soggy. Our meals didn't really come out at the same time but I guess I'd rather get it right away than have it sitting under a heat lamp. The fries that come with the burger are similar to those from Steak and Shake (thin-cut/shoe string fries). Those were probably the best thing out of the whole meal. I was told that the burgers were good. Our lemon chicken was horrible. I've never had to return something back to the kitchen before but it just wasn't good and not worth $20. It was really sour (not sweet and sour, just sour) and the chicken was really rubbery. The chicken was in little strips, I was expecting an actual piece of chicken breast that you usually get at restaurants.

Our drinks sometimes went empty but other than that our waiter was really nice and accommodating. He didn't question that the monkey bread was raw or that we didn't like our dish. 

I don't think any of us will ever go back. There are just too many other options in Old Town that are so much better. What a shame.

Got a message from Jake J. probably someone who has a share in the restaurant since he posted those professional photos. An average diner wouldn't have access to those. Here's what he's got to say: \"Got love the complainers. They always have yelp accounts. I had to write once I saw your review. Monkey bread is my favorite and it is not raw in the middle it is melted cheese. Figured you would know that with your advanced pallet or see it with your own eyes. Can't please everyone. Ive been there so many times never had one complaint nor heard one around me until this stupid site that have so called \"wanna be food critics\" didn't momma teach u anything..... If you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all. Guess not. Typical \"yelper\"\" Funny because he has written unfavorable reviews in the past, some even promoting Sevens'. Some people are silly."}
{"text":"4 star average out of 54 reviews? What could go wrong! UGH.

WTF, Yelp? You are usually spot on, or at least KIND OF in the ballpark when it comes to rating places. I have honestly noidea how Sevens has a 4 star average.

For a small positive, at least the decor is cool. The big garage doors opened onto a large patio, and as other reviews mention, the ambiance is pretty awesome. I loved the big sparkly lamp/light fixture that hung over a tall table in the middle of the dining room. Everything felt modern and sleek. I thought the chalkboard inside the bar area really clashed with the decor...I don't know, spelling out your million fruity martini drinks (Orange Julius? I just got diabetes) doesn't seem so fancy.

The location is weird. This place had to have been a bank in a former life, right? It sits like a giant mansion right on McDowell and 77th, and right besides some SKETCHO hotel. Me: \"Who the hell stays at a hotel right here?\" Boyfriend: \"People making meth.\" We walked in and, seeing three other tables at 10:00 a.m. on a Sunday in Scottsdale, should have known to just peace out. The first thing I saw was a couple sending back a plate of food. Awesome! It took way too long to be greeted. Our server was nice enough, but it was so obvious he wanted to be ANYWHERE but working. I understand, it's Memorial Day weekend and you're working but man. You just gotta do it sometimes.

The food actually earned the second star. It was pretty tasty. I had the veggie benedict (I loved the tiny knife cuts of assorted veggies--roasted asparagus standing out) and it was tasty, although one of my poached eggs had been pierced and the yolk was all sopped up by the English muffin by the time it arrived to the table. The hash browns were seasoned and delicious. My side of fruit was on the same plate as the hot food--no separate tiny bowl or plate for cold fruit? It was meh--honeydew, melon, watermelon.

BF ordered the \"enraged\" corned beef hash. Again, he said it was tasty, but not exactly \"enraging\" (aka, not that spicy) and it came with a uniform square (Kraft single?) of cheese melted on top. Uh?

Protip: They serve bottomless mimosas for $15 until 2:00 p.m. on the weekend. Even if you just want two, get this. Why? Because just one is $10. Made with bottled, concentrated juice and a normal amount of champagne. Really? I can go down the street to Orange Table (leaps and bounds over Sevens, in all aspects) and get a full glass of champagne + St. Germain (their Daybreak drink...delicious) for $7. Give me a break. 

Perhaps their 4 star average is based on an amazeballs, 180 degree turn from breakfast dinner and happy hour...but we won't be back to find out."}
{"text":"One word summary: abysmal. 

Wow, where do I begin. I came here for Sunday brunch with my parents based on the good reviews, and I can't even begin to express my disappointment. 

Things started out fine. Our server, Jenny, seemed nice enough. She took our order quickly. I ordered the garden frittata, mom the beach benedict w/ home fries, and dad the american bistro breakfast.

Food comes. Mom's beach benedict comes with hash browns instead of home fries. It's also missing the star ingredient: avocado. We tell Jenny, and she says...

\"Oh, sorry the kitchen menu is different than the customer menu. Sometimes dishes come out slightly different than what the menu says.\"

I almost burst out laughing from shock and amazement. Um, WHAT!? Do you realize what you just told us, Jenny!? I'm guessing our dropped jaws were her signal to go back to the kitchen and make things right. She comes back out with a little plate of avocado and then says...

\"The kitchen doesn't cook home fries until after 11am, sorry about that,\" then walks away.

Isn't this the kind of thing you should tell us when we ORDER the food?

My garden frittata was really just 2 over-medium eggs with chopped veggies on top. Please do not call that a frittata. 

After we got our check and gave them a credit card to pay, I realized I had a 10% off coupon. I told Jenny when she got back, but she said they couldn't apply it since they had already run the credit card. I understand it's a bit of a pain in the butt, but it's not impossible to void the transaction and then recalculate the bill. And considering her appalling service thus far, it was the least she could have done.

Get you ish together, guys."}
{"text":"I honestly have no idea how this place has as many stars as it does. It's been awhile since I've been. I went once with a friend for Brunch on a Sunday. The first sign that a place is less than stellar is when you're the only guests in the joint. I chalked it up to being a newer place. 

The decor and ambiance are def on point. But the location makes it feel super out of place. It should be in Old Town if it's gonna be decorated like that, not on McDowell and Miller. 

I ordered the corned beef hash and it was bleh. Nothing special, and my friend ordered a different hash and hers was just not good. Plain and simple not good. The cheese was cut into little squares and all sweaty looking. I mean the presentation of both dishes definitely deserve an A for effort. But you can make a piece of rubber look pretty but it ain't gonna taste good. That's for sure. Another concerning factor was that my friend ordered grapefruit juice. First, she asked if it was fresh squeezed and they said yes. Ummm. No way no how this was fresh squeezed - it was def out of a can and it was def spoiled. You know when juice has been left out too long and it starts to get fizzy because it's fermenting or something? Well that was her juice. Gross.

Needless to say I've never been back and I will never go back. Their burgers look and sound amazing but I'm not willing to spend money on this place. I don't know how they're even open still. I'm seriously questioning how these people have left great reviews because it sucked. 

And Marius E.'s review saying it's similar to the Vig, St Francis, Windsor or Postino?!!??! Are you on crack fool?"}
{"text":"The atmosphere in this place is great, looks like a very fancy dining experience is coming up.  The menu makes your mouth water just waiting to taste the faire.  But alas, once the food gets there, it's downhill.  I'm giving 3 start because my kids liked the vegetarian lasagna.  I however like my shrimp cocktail cold, not warm or room temperature and the prosciutto wrapped melon wasn't up to par either.  With a little more attention to detail (and the food), this place could be rocking."}
{"text":"Owner Greg Jacobson did not pay employees plus had legal problems....... Thats WAY HE REALLY FLEW THE COOP!!!!!!! I worked for him and was Board... a victims..... of his shady ran operations plus he must have been paying off the Arizona Labor Board..... the representative was very rude to me and was a one sided to Greg Jacobson he was paying her under the table and probably more because he was a skeeze bag 



So me and my wife went to Sevens bistro the other night and from hearing all the great reviews we thought it was going to be an excellent restaurants but boy was I mistaken when we got there the hostess supposedly with the mostess sat us by the corner where was dark and gloomy then we looked at the menu and thought these prices were little overpriced we were the only people sitting there so we thought we would have great service but instead or waitress had no idea what the menu is all had involved and when we ask questions about the menu she just looked at is dumbfounded and said let me go back and ask the chef so we got our fish in ships with I read penne pasta vodka looks real good taste and it would have been a probably a2 on the scale um the fish and chips were very soggy overcooked and brown so we asked for a difference thing instead of the fish n chips because they did not look I'm feeling when we did this the chef came out and boy would I have would I would not have this person cooking my food looks awesome grafiti and kinda if I wouldn't want to eat here so we decided to get the veggie spread and that was overcooked the eggplant way too mushy the eggplant the asparagus was way much garlic there is sparagus was way too hard so we ask to speak to the manager and instead we got the owner we told the owner we would not be paying for any of the food because we suck c*** roaches walking around and that was just way too disgusting our server was very rude and crafts with us and the chef was also very not professional so after we told the owner we were not paying he decided that he told us that if we did not pay he would call the police because it's considered stealing and we said we would not pay for this food because it is disgusting it is not IP Ling does not taste good and there are cockroaches that is disgusting instead we had to pay the bill because Greg Jacobson the owner was just acting like an immature little child telling us he's going to call the police on us so we don't want to bother with this time or with his establishment ever again all I know is you shouldn't have review letter saying this place is so great when it is a negative 1 out of 10 I do not recommend this place to anyone because of bad service por ownership of the restaurant and really you would have a cook in there looking like that I don't know people its your call if you want to eat here but personally me and my wife will never go back and we will tell all of our friends never to go there because of the way we were treated during our period at Sevens bistros...

{"text":"Not sure what we were getting into as it's a hotel restaurant, but the food was really really good! The prime rib was tender & flavorful, & the fish was cooked perfectly.  The mixed drinks were OK, but they had a nice variety of beers & wine.  The staff was friendly & professional.  We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Last night I had the charcuterie board and it was fantastic! Tonight, I had grilled watermelon wrapped in prosciutto, a Caesar Salad with chicken and I wrote home about it! Literally!! I live 45 minutes away and my husband and I are already planning to visit in the next week! It's new and it is a MUST!"}
{"text":"Went here while visiting Family in Scottsdale, They tried the four course dinner with beers special. Each course was served with a beer that complimented the dish. They loved it, I had the ginger miso salmon. It was cooked perfectly and the flavor was excellent. If I find Myself in the area again, I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"If they had brought my coffee on time , I might have gone for two stars, but service counts . So does food, and the food here is not impressive . My charcuterie platter had WallMart meats and cheese; presumably that's because the Indian management of this restaurant don't know better. That would also explain the lack of mustard and the good nan. My wife's burger? For that there is no explanation or digestion. However, the attitude of the management when apprised of our discontent was exceptional and for that they should be complimented. They took criticism and suggestions to heart and refused payment, instead asking that we come back again with the hope that they work towards improvement. That is a really good way to approach negatives."}
{"text":"Really excited to finally have a chance to check this place out. Wasn't too sure about it before since the ratings on Yelp were either very good or bad. Maybe it's because I came on a Tuesday night but it was very dead. I think there were only three parties (including my table) the entire night. I give this place three stars instead of two because the staff were really nice and attentive. However the food was merely okay. 

I ordered the \"Taste of Summer\" salad - lettuce was brownish green and huge clumps of cheese. The portion was very generous even though I got the smaller size. For entree, I ordered the Chicken Indian Curry and the \"Build Your Own Classic French Gourmet Burger Dinner\" - thought both were nothing too special. The French fries that came with the burger were pretty good though. For dessert, I ordered the Peach Cobbler since they said the Bread Pudding would take a long time to make (was quite disappointed about that). It was also okay. I'm not sure if I would order it again. 

Overall, I would like to give this place another chance. Maybe on a Friday or Saturday night. I heard that they have live music! Did I mention that the patio is dog friendly as well? That's definitely a plus in my book."}
{"text":"This place was great!  Service was phenomenal.  I had the chef's Niger and it didn't disappoint.  Would come back anytime."}
{"text":"Went to this place again and loved it again!!! Brandon is an amazing bartender! He made my wife a Fabulous Chocolate Thunder Martini and an Electric pink Cosmo. The thunder was so good we ended up having 2 each. His Margarita is the best I have had in Arizona. We had the Ribeye Delmonico that was delicious and the Chicken Alfredo that was very good as well."}
{"text":"I think 1 star is to much this place is just awful way over priced and the food is probably the worst in the valley"}
{"text":"This place may have the same name as the last but this is under new ownership! They have a two page menu with tapas,salads, burgers, and entrees. They also have an horederve  section for $7 and you pick three of the 5 options. We got the grilled watermelon and prosciutto, goat cheese and salmon, and the blue cheese truffle- each flavorful and delicious (side note a bit salty)  we then each got salads the Asian and the Caesar - both good but recommend the Asian.  We finished with the bread pudding which is just delicious French toast!! 
Great layout and great service! Will be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is gorgeous on the inside! Their menu is 5 stars and their service is amazing. If you ever have a moment to check it out I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Coming in on a Friday night there was a huge crowd in the bar area. I was afraid there was a long wait but the hostess was able to seat us immediately. Turns out there was a special event going on. 

It was great people watching for my date and I as it clearly was a 50 and over singles ready-to-mingle event. Service was good and decor was nice. There were only a handful of tables aside from us and the special group. Food was good and freshly made. The wait proved that but luckily we had good entertainment and glasses of wine to hold us over. I had the Seafood Cioppino (sp?) and my husband had a ribeye steak. Both were good but you're looking at $40/ person with drinks. For that price, I'm kinda looking for more."}
{"text":"We were a little concerned when we first arrived at 10:30am and they were closed. Online their hours are supposed to be from 7am-10pm. Someone came to the door and said they wouldn't be open until 11 because the cook hadn't arrived yet. Odd for a place that serves breakfast. We were a little annoyed but since we wanted to use the Groupon we had we returned at 11. We sat at the bar  and took notice that the place might have recently been renovated and has a modern vibe with nice lighting, several booths and is quite large. We wanted to take advantage of the Happy Hour All Day on Sundays but the manager informed us there was no bartender but he would be more than happy to oblige us. My husband went through the paces of how to make a Margarita and he did a great job. We ordered the chef southwest burger with sweet potato fries and it was very good. The burger was juicy and the sauce that came with it had a slight spiciness and we were told it had chipolte spice in it. We were the only customers in there and left around 12 noon. The serve was great as was the food. I hope they make it because it would be nice to have a good restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"it's not often that one can truly experience one of the worst meals of ones life.....so, if that is your goal... indeed.....this is a must try place!!

friday night after spring training baseball game.....hadn't eaten so, wanted a decent meal.     like a moron, opted for the salmon .   how i even got through 25% is one of the wonders of the world.      at least a 4 day old piece of fish....dry, overcooked and tasteless.    served with an interesting sounding risotto cake with mushrooms and grapes....mushrooms and grapes were lucky they were not present!   they saved themselves from a tasteless...completely NON risotto like texture and a badly crisp exterior.

poor carrots also had to endure this mindless plate... unseasoned baby carrots that were so overcooked , i'm shocked that they were able to keep their shape at all!  

managed 25% of the dinner...pushed it aside, and just thanked the restaurant gods...that the nice waiter was able to make a good cadillac margarita!   the only saving grace!!

incredible how anyone in a kitchen can actually be that bad at their job!

and OMG....please just for a weird time travel trip to a bad hotel bar in...like 1975?  check out the live \"music\".    epically bad to the point of laughable, but...the food was just so bad...i lost my sense of humor"}
{"text":"This is a tough one. Because the food wasn't that bad. However, I'll start with the fact that we were staying at the accompanying hotel and I couldn't get through on the phone to save my life. Busy signal nonstop. So we decided to just walk and get our food to go, no problem. We entered the restaurant and there was ZERO customers so I was confused to why the phone was busy. Anyhow, we stood at the host station with the owner sitting right in front of us. She did not greet us, acknowledge us or do what I would assume an owner would do and take care of us. Instead, she hollered at her staff to come and see us.  Rude right?! What kind of owner of an establishment does that to their paying customers? Anyways, a guy comes up, very nice, and proceeds to take our order. He's new but really polite and I can totally appreciate that. His \"trainer\" was somewhat of a jerk, speaking to him like a child. Long story short (too late!) the way the owners treat their staff and customers is ridiculous and unbelievable which makes me never want to return. I tipped our guy $5 and wished him good luck because what a jacked up place to work!!!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Groupon. Absolutely satisfied and will be coming back. Bacon wrapped shrimp was on point. My co worker order a burger with no bun (gluten free), it arrived to our table with the bun, but not a big deal. Server was still great, and so was the food."}
