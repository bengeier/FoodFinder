{"text":"I wont go into the details of everything but basically we got a $20 cold pizza delivered 1 and a half hours after ordering and I wasn't happy with how they handled it. 

Pizza was just \"so-so\".  Not sure if it would have been better warm or even hot, we didn't have a chance to try it that way.

Anyway, this was simply our experience.  Everyone has a bad day or bad service every now and then but unfortunately you can't \"fix\" management.  :-)"}
{"text":"When I was in college I considered that every class I started I had an \"A\".  It was mine to lose.  I walk into businesses with the same approach.  They have 5 stars.  Theirs to lose.

Cheap about serving water...\"ding\" down goes one star.

One of our cups was dirty.  Not a little - dirty.  It was on the bottom of the stack of cups we got, but still...\"ding\" there goes another one.

Plates.  Again, plate on the bottom was dirty.  Like greasy it had some food on it dirty...\"ding\" there goes another star.

Although this is a pizza place we didn't have any pizza.  We had wings (baked) which were average.  Good sauce.  We had cheese ravioli which was good and we had a Gyro pocket which was good.

What got under my skin here was the water.  Or lack of water.  We don't drink very much soda.  We generally drink water at restaurants, at least when we're not having DRINKS.  So we ask for water with our food which we are eating there.  

\"This is all we have for water.\"  Holding up a styrofoam cup just larger than a shot-glass.  Do you mean to tell me that you are going to punish me if I don't purchase a soda?  What was that sound?  Average food, dirty disposable service ware and cheap about the water?  \"ding\" down to one star."}
{"text":"Got the supreme pizza and wasn't impressed. It kind of tasted like a frozen pizza. We went in to order the pizza to go and their was no one at the counter for about 5 minutes...we almost left because of this. Then, while we waited for the pizza someone else came in to pick up their called in order and they waited 10 minutes at the counter until someone came out...bad service and mediocre pizza...won't return."}
