{"text":"Everything we tried was very good. I thought at first we would have to box some to take home because we were full of popcorn and nachos from the movies. Not so. This food was so good that I was scraping the every last bit from each plate. I am coming back."}
{"text":"I had noticed Elvira's Belizean Cafe a couple of times the last few months and finally decided to satisfy my curiosity about Belizean food. The oxtail stew was five-star flavorful.  The meat was fork-tender, the veggies very complementary, and the gravy full of flavor.  I also enjoyed the coconut rice. The staff is very genuinely friendly and efficient, which makes for a completely enjoyable eating experience. I'll definitely be back ... soon."}
{"text":"Great mom and pop place very affordable and food is big on flavor. Bean panadas were great appetizers and the red snapper is both huge, moist and delicious. Order a watermelon drink"}
{"text":"Great food. Good service. Very helpful manager and familiarizing us with their type of food and choices."}
{"text":"Great family owned restaurant with delicious food! Everyone working here was so friendly. I had the oxtail lunch dish and it was so flavorful."}
{"text":"They just open 2 days ago. We tried the ox trail and it was great. Awesome service, good luck guys!!"}
{"text":"This is the first  time I have had  Belizean cuisine and I am sold! Great food quick and polite owners! Definitely coming back! Stew Chicken entree"}
{"text":"The only one who was a one who u was u we ifuu you have weaawqqwwq It's It'ss ? s7uß uusu"}
{"text":"The red snapper dish was one of the best we've tasted. We also tried the fried chicken, short ribs and stew beef. Excellent authentic food and very friendly service."}
{"text":"We used to live in Belize, and miss both the food and hospitality of the Belizean people. Elvira's food brought back fond memories. The dishes were well prepared, presented nicely, and served by a friendly staff. We enjoyed a wonderful conversation with the owner, including stories of his childhood growing up in Corozal, in northern Belize. Make sure you try the fish panades. If you're there for breakfast try the fried jacks drizzled with honey. We'll be back for more."}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix and looking for something authentic and soul like food to eat. Found Elvira's. I went and ordered fried fish with rice. Delicious food and the owners were very friendly as well. They come up to you to make sure you're enjoying yourself and the food. Will definitely check it out again."}
{"text":"First time to Elvira's, it won't be my last. Setting is nice, service very personable, perfectly coordinated with the appetizers we ordered. The star of the show is definitely the food! I enjoy two things about a representative restaurant - typical presentation of their cuisine, and a local base to spread the love for that cuisine. Elvira's gives both in fine style.  We had panapes and salbutes as appetizers, served hot and very tasty. Then the stewed chicken and stewed pork chop dinners. We were HAPPY! The rice and beans on the side would have made a meal, the potato salad a perfect change-up for the rich flavors. Both entrees suited our taste completely! We live about 1/2 hour away and we will make the trip often! We will make a return trip to Belize some time but this local experience is so good, I just hope the native cuisine will match that we found at Elvira's!"}
{"text":"La comida es espectacular, la atención es increíble recomiendo este restaurante, pedimos agua de coco, pescado frito y costillas, todo estaba delicioso, la carta es muy variada"}
{"text":"Friendly service, good variety of food, and clean environment. The stewed chicken, ox tail, salbutes, and sweet potato pudding are flavorful. Many gluten free options."}
{"text":"Tonight we chose Elvira's and we r glad we did ... my husband chose the oxtails and he loved them .. I had the stewed chicken which reminded me of my moms and my cooking ... Elvira waited on us a very nice polite owner ... her husband prepared my watermelon drink ! I loved it ... 3 people can share it ! Louis the owner was very friendly and helpful ... I loved the music and wanted to dance !!! Please widen out and try Elvira's ... you will be happy you did !!   They are on Groupon 12 dollars for 20 worth of food .                 Jerry and Cheryl"}
{"text":"Stumble across this little gem on the way to eat something else. Their food is authentic and simple. The amount of food for the money was a good value. Plus they have Marie Sharp's hot sauce! We had the stewed chicken and tried the oxtail. Both of which were very good."}
{"text":"First visit here because of Groupon, trying something new.  What a great experience.  The people were ready to please and the food was fun, interesting and really good.  All the \"hot\" and \"spice\" was on the side so you can make it your way.  The appetizers were great and nice portion to share.  The dinners were priced right and included a lot.  My biggest surprise was the rice made with coconut, it was wonderful and I don'e even like coconut.  I had the stewed chicken and my friend had the pork chop, both were so good we can't wait to go back and try more."}
{"text":"We went to Elvira's Belizean Cafe today. We were greeted by the owner. He explained the menu to both of us. We started by ordering Salbutes for the appetizer...excellent..I could literally just sit and eat these all day, make sure to use the hot sauce (fiery). We then ordered the Stew Chicken Plate and the Stew Beef Plate, they came with coconut rice and beans, potato salad, and fried Plantains.. fantastic.. the Stew Chicken was fall of the bone tender, you could taste the love and craftsmanship in the dishes. The Beef Stew Plate was equally delicious. We then had dessert which we chose the Milk Cake with Caramel Frosting and Cherries...incredible flavors..we can't wait to come back and try other things from the menu. This restaurant was very reasonably priced. This is a gem in Chandler."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant you have got to try.  The owners are a husband and wife team from Belize so they really know their stuff.  The fried chicken and vegi omelets are spectacular.  Great food at a modest price. This was our first visit and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Found Elvira's via Groupon so we decided to give it a try.  We ordered the Penadas to start, 2 of each Bean & Fish.  Very good. Then we ordered the short ribs & the chicken stew. We both had the coconut rice and potato salad.  Both were very good, fall off the bone tender. They were nice enough to bring me a sample of the oxtail and a couple specialty beverages.  Overall very much enjoyed it.  Super nice, very attentive to their customers."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim to try something new and happy we did! Highly recommend the salbutes! They've only been open 5 days, so it's pretty quiet so far. Love the Caribbean music playing. The watermelon drinks are pretty good too but the salbutes are good! They look like tostadas but they're better. So flavorful! Don't let the pictures deceive you!  As constructive criticism it would really help if the menu items had descriptions instead of just assuming everyone knows what ducunu is or the like. This is Arizona and Belizean food isn't exactly a thing! But they made up for it by personally describing items and pulling up pictures on their phones. But really when they get busier this won't be feasible.  Also the menu could be organized better as we thought the ducunu, salbutes etc were add one to the chicken stew dinner when in fact they were more like a la carte items. They were also out of a lot of items but I'd chalk that up to them being so newly opened and not knowing how to predict what people will order."}
{"text":"Yummy!!  I had never tried Belizean food before but now I am in love with it.  I keep ordering the chicken because it is so juicy and tasty.  Others in my family have ordered beef and fish, with good results too.  Their watermelon drinks are so good and refreshing, but plan on sharing it.  It is big and is served in the watermelon.  The service is a little slow but the servers are very friendly.  I will return for sure."}
{"text":"I'm afraid I am a bit biased. I love my family members Belizean food a tad bit more. The bread pudding was delicious and I ordered it to go. Perfect after a little warming up in the microwave after a long day out.  The waitress and the cook were friendly. I got a choice of a regular table or a booth. They offered some hot sauce- Sharp's... They also had a little gift area where you could buy trinkets that say \"Belize\" on them."}
{"text":"Yummmmm! The whole fish was so good and the Panades were amazing! The fish one was my favorite! Great drinks too- ask for them to put rum in your watermelon drink ;) we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Greeted with a smile and a sincere come in.  Excellent customer service as the gentleman who assisted my son and I was cheerful. We ordered our food to go and while we were waiting the gentleman offered to show my son around (he's 5 years old). Also purchased a souvenir which was affordable. The oxtail and stew chicken was good however the customer service was great! Definitely will go there soon to dine in."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday night. The server was really nice, attentive, and explained the menu well.  The restaurant had a pretty steady stream of customers coming in and out but was fairly empty. The portions are pretty big and you get a lot of sides. Had the beef stew. The food took quite a while to come out, but it's a cool experience and fun to try something different. Loved the plantains and potato salad!"}
{"text":"I have been in here before and loved the service and the food.  Have sent tons of friends and told many people about it.  Took some friends here today for lunch to introduce them to the restaurant.  We came in at 1pm ordered and then waited 40 minutes.  We had 2 young kids with us.  I finally got up and went to ask the server why it was taking so long as by this point it had been 45 minutes and nothing had come out.  No one checked on us or said anything.  The waitress replied that the fish we ordered took a long time.  I said that's fine, just bring out whatever is ready because we don't need to have all the food come out at the same time.  She's like well when it's done, they'll put it on the counter.  I said that is fine but can you please let them know we do not need to wait for the fish.  Just send out whatever is ready.  ( Most of the entrees we ordered were stews, which I know is already pre-made and just needs to be plated so there was no reason to wait for all the food to be \"cooked\")  I was frustrated by the waitresses response and kept waiting to try to flag the owner down.  He was at another table, then went to speak to someone that walked in.  He finally came over and as I proceeded to try to explain to him, that we needed to get back to work and the kids were hungry and we just wanted whatever was ready to be sent out first, the waitress came over and started to say something.  I just got more frustrated and as I started to try to explain, simultaneously the owner told me I needed to stop yelling (I was not yelling) and the food started to come out.  He held the plates of food in his hand and said well you are welcome to leave!  I don't care.  I can just take this all back.  Doesn't matter to me.  If it were just me and friends, I would have walked out.  But we had 2 kids that had been waiting for 50 minutes now and were tired and hungry.  I said no, we just want our food.  He said again, I can just take this back I don't care.  I said NO I am asking you to put the food down!  He plopped food down and as I was tearing into the fish for one of the kids, it was still raw inside.  I told him the fish was raw and his response \"well that's what you get for rushing us.\"  I was so angry but calmed down as we were with friends and ate our food.  I was so angry I was about to write the review then and there but calmed down and decided to give the owner a chance to apologize.  I went up and paid and said I don't think you handled that situation correctly.  He said yea you're probably right.  Insincere and basically just shrugging it off.  I proceeded again to try to explain the situation which he listed to half heartedly.  I again said I don't think you handled that situation right and got the same uninterested response of yea, you're probably right.  I am really sad to write this review as I really like the food and was hoping they would do well.  But I will never be back and will let all my friends that I have sent there know what a horrible and embarrassing situation today was for all involved."}
{"text":"So authentic and so delicious! Elvira's garnachas and panades are right on! Fried chicken and stewed chicken are excellent. Sweet potato pudding topped everything off.  Highly recommend and I will be back often.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"This place was great! We live in the neighborhood and noticed this new restaurant. We have never had Belizean food so didn't know what to expect. It was very different and very delicious.  The owners and family were there, serving, answering questions and visiting. Very friendly and taught us a lot about their cuisine.  We had a two appetizers, the panades and the salbutes, both really good but my son thought the salbutes were \"the bomb\", and I agree!  For entrees we had stewed beef, stewed short ribs and stewed chicken, which all came with homemade potato salad, plantain and choice of white rice and stewed beans, or coconut rice and beans (together). All the meats were stewed to perfection, tender, succulent and each one had it's own unique twist of flavor. I have had plantains before and quite frankly have not liked them. These were slightly sweet and were especially good  when eaten with the rice.  They brought samples of drinks to taste, both guava and sour sop. Both were good but we stuck with water.  Normally, we do not get desert but couldn't resist our server, so we ended up sharing two desserts. The bread pudding was just freshly made and was delicious. The sweet potato pudding was totally unique, very sweet and absolutely wonderful.  Great family-owned restaurant. They also do breakfast, which we will try soon. Give them a shot and support a locally owned restaurant!"}
{"text":"So, I've never before had Belizean food, but I figured why not try something new on a Saturday night? Turns out it's a glorious combination of cuisine from that entire part of the world with some great local dishes thrown in for more. We got the salbutas, marinated pulled chicken on fried discs of crispy maize dough, served with hot sauce. I would eat these every day of my life as they are the perfect combination of crispy, savory, and a bit of spice with the hot sauce. We then got the stewed beef and stewed chicken platters, both coming with flavorful meats with a side of coconut rice and beans, potato salad (with a hint of coconut), and a fried plantain. I also got a freshly cut coconut to drink that they then cut in half for us to scoop out the center. It was all really, really good food plus the service was unbelievably friendly and helpful in making choices. There is a great Groupon offered currently if you need that bit of push to try it out. Salbutas, I shall be back for you. Oh, yes, I shall."}
{"text":"My foodie friend and I checked this out today. We tried the pandas, fish and bean. I am not a big fan of beans, but it was good. The fish version was nice as well. I had the oxtail entree and my friend had the stewed beef. Very nice well seasoned. Plantains we delish. Nice music and a chill atmosphere. They are trying for a liquor license. A good beer would have topped the meal off."}
{"text":"Elvira's Belizean Cafe on Alma school and Warner is amazing! Their main dishes like Oxtail (yes oxtail) tastes just like beef. It's amazing. I love their main dishes. As for a small dish I like the panadas and the ducunu is goes best with the actual stew. Anyway I'm going for the pigtail next time. Sounds weird but if it's anything like the rest of the food it tastes amazing. Take this from a picky eater.  The service is very friendly. The staff is very attentive, absolutely kind, and the atmosphere feels just like home. I like the Belizean music they play and the seating is quite comfortable.  So now the down sides. The only thing I didn't like was the small plates except the two mentioned about. I think it's because I'm picky though lol. My roommates liked them."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today for lunch.  Very good food.  I had the short ribs and the meat just melts in your mouth.  No heavy handed spices, just flavorful and savory.  Desserts are made here and the bread pudding is very good with a nice rum flavor.  I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Being from a country that's right next to Belize, I have always wondered what Belizean food would taste like. I was so excited to see that this new restaurant had opened not to far from home!   Went in for an early lunch and was greeted by the friendly owner upon entering the building. He told us to sit wherever and brought us over the menus. They have the breakfast side on the front, lunch side which is from 11 to 3, and then dinner items on the last page which is from 3 until close. We ordered our drinks (watermelon drink and a Pepsi) and placed our entree orders.  The food came out rather quickly, I ordered the special of the day which was the chicken posole, and the hubs ordered a breakfast plate that consisted of bread, country potatoes, eggs, and French toast. My posole tasted amazing! Just sprinkle on the toppings (cilantro, onion, cabbage, and some hot sauce) and bam the soup is delicious.  *do be careful if ordering the chicken posole though. The soup comes with chicken and chicken bones. (something I wish I would've known, I hate bones) The first spoonful I took, I didn't see the bone and bit down hard.   The restaurant is huge and there are more then plenty of tables to pick from. It wasn't at all busy when I went and the service was great. Four stars just because I hate having to dig for chicken bones in my soup :("}
{"text":"No lunch special. Ordered OX Tail I got 3 small pieces for $13 bucks. Not Caribbean to me not much flavor very blan taste. Caribbean food has lots of flavor Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican & Jamaica."}
{"text":"To quote my boyfriend \"If you think the food has no flavor then you must have a deaf palate\".  We had a little bit of everything and enjoyed ALL of it!! Delicious food and friendly service.  Yes the service isn't speedy, but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"So if your in Arizona and want some authentic Belizian food you have to stop here! Me and my boyfriend on a Sunday morning stopped in and the service was great! But it didn't stop there because the food was lip smacking finger licking good.... So if you are looking for something filling and grease with great staff and atmosphere you have to try this spot! Thank you for such a wonderful experience, oh and that watermelon drink was on point!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try a new cuisine, and Elvira's is right around the corner, so we decided to stop in. So glad we did! I had the fried chicken, some of the best I've ever eaten. My husband had the red snapper - fresh and delicious. The service was very friendly and attentive, making recommendations and describing unknown dishes to us. It's fortunate this restaurant is in our neighborhood, because we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is our first visit and we'll definitely be back. I had the stewed chicken meal and it was great! Hubby had the short rib meal and the short ribs were to die for!!  That's on my list for our next visit. The potato salad was different but awesome.  Made with egg and corn. Yum! When you're done with dinner,  don't forget the bread pudding! Had a smooth texture, not like the lumpy stuff you're used to. I prefer it this way so much more!"}
{"text":"This was our first time trying Belizean food. It was delicious full of flavor. The restaurant is family owned. They were are all very nice and friendly. They explained to us what their foods consisted of. I highly recommend this place. We got the salbutes, beef, coconut rice, potato salad, and plantains. All the food was very tasty."}
{"text":"Dinner winner we'll be back! 1st time trying oxtail, ducunu, & salbutes...& we'll take maaany more next visit! Staff was very friendly and patient explaining menu items to us."}
{"text":"OMG,THIS PLACE IS DA BOMB DIGGITY!!! I called to make reservations for a birthday celebration for my best friend's birthday and 3 children for 9 AM on a Tuesday but was told they open at 10 AM. (Their website says 6 AM?)  The gentleman I spoke to offered to open a hour early just for us and I gladly accepted the offer. I also asked if a birthday cake could be prepared and was told that would be no problem. When we arrived a large table with plenty of room for all 5 of us had been set up with a balloon tied to the back of each chair much to the delight of the children. OK, let's get to the food...I ordered a soursop drink to start. This is difficult to describe other than to say that it is a sweet, creamy drink with a hint of flavor similar to coconut milk. It took a while to prepare but was worth the wait. My friend had coffee (no review). We ordered the ducunu appetizer and received two of what looked like tamales with no wrapper nor any filling. Simply perfectly steamed and rather sweet masa. Excellent and a great start to a great meal. I ordered the pigtail plate (yes, seriously) and my bff ordered the stewed chicken plate. Each of the plates came with sides of stew beans, coconut rice, potato salad and two thin slices of fried plantain. I cannot review each and every item but they were all very delicious and there was plenty to share with 3 hungry kids. Now onto the birthday cake. It was a yellow cake with chocolate icing, maraschino cherries, several candles and a few other birthday accoutrements....just perfect! BTW Elvira was our server. Thank You Elvira and staff for  fantastic birthday celebration. Next time I'm having the oxtail (yes, seriously lol)."}
{"text":"**just got their liquor license so they have a full bar now!\"  This place has one of my favorite dishes in the valley, fried red snapper.  It's crispy and flavorful and has a really nice dipping sauce on the side.  I don't know anywhere else in the area you can get this dish and I can't imagine it could be done better either!  Oxtail stew is also really good and the owners are really nice."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Went in early when they opened to order a to go cup of coffee and was told by the waitress that she was not going to make a batch just for one cup. It's so absurd. If you aren't willing to make a fresh batch for a client then you should either take coffee off the menu or fire this waitress."}
{"text":"Delicious food! My first time trying Caribbean food and it did not disappoint. Service was friendly and seems like a fun place to come with friends/family. There were Caribbean songs playing in the background and the place is huge - it even has a pool table! Looked like there was one person in the front and the other cooking in the kitchen - so at the end the service was a bit slow.  Food: Fish panades: yummy! 4 crunchy tacos with fish filling that's sealed at the top. Comes with a onion/vinegar dip and mild/spicy sauce. The filling was delicious with the spicy sauce.  Oxtail plate with coconut rice: the rice itself was ok, but the oxtail sauce accompanied it. The oxtail was melt-in-your-mouth buttery and delicious! The flavors were great and the two fried plantains added some sweetness to the dish. Came with a side of potato salad which was also good but nothing special. Put some of that spicy sauce on this dish to elevate the flavors!  Coconut water: a young coconut with a straw and umbrella in it. May be a little expensive for what it is, but goes well with the dish. Enjoyed my dessert of coconut meat in the end, but I had to scrape it with my straw. Really wish they had cut the top of the coconut larger to be able to eat with a spoon!  I would say the portions are big enough to share between two people especially if you get another appetizer.  Parking: Plenty of parking in front of the store.  Price: Total cost came out to almost $30."}
{"text":"Just stumbled across this place. Great food great service! Reminds me of my days spent exploring Belize.  Will become a regular here."}
{"text":"Thank you, Joyce, for writing such a great review.  We finally got up here to try Elvira's over the weekend and are so glad we did.  The first thing I noticed was how clean and sunny the restaurant is, which makes for a pleasant atmosphere.  They had some music playing, but not too loudly and there were some fantastic aromas coming out of the kitchen.  We didn't want to get too crazy because we had to run some errands afterwards, so just stuck with the oxtail lunch ($10.99) and the stewed chicken ($8.99).  I opted for the coconut rice & beans, and my husband got the white rice and stewed beans with his.  First thing, the meats are so tender and flavorful, I can't even begin to describe them.  I don't know anything about the seasonings they use, but together they provide very warm flavors that create perfect comfort food.    Then the next thing, you have to take some of your rice and put it in the broth that comes with the meats so it can soak up those wonderful flavors too.  Oh my God, but that was good.  A couple of maduros and a cup of potato salad come with the meals as well.  I love maduros and don't get to eat them very often, so they are always a treat.  The potato salad was nice and creamy and eggy, just like grandma used to make.    They also had conch soup on the daily specials board, and when Elvira overheard me say I forgot to order some, she brought us a little sample with rice to try.  That was delicious as well.  Dining here makes me want to learn more about the seasonings they use.  That was our first time here, but it definitely won't be the last.  I look forward to trying the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I actually had the opportunity to spend some time in a village in Belize on a couple occasions. So I know authentic Belizean food when I see it. Belizean food is very similar to Caribbean food but with a touch of its own uniqueness to it. It's nice to know that there is a place with Belize natives serving their country's food not too far from me. I came here for lunch and it wasn't too busy despite how spacious the place is. You can't go anywhere in Belize without seeing a bottle of Marie Sharp's sitting on a table (the main factory is there). The bottles in the display case immediately triggered memories of my time there. My server (and I'm assuming the owner) was very welcoming and did his best to create a Belizean environment for me. He flipped on some Caribbean music and described the food as if I just landed in his country. He even reminded me of all the mosquito bites I endured while living in the jungle. The watermelon drink was fantastic. It's basically a small watermelon that had its insides removed and blended up into a slushy and returned to its shell. The panades (similar to a empanada) came out fresh from the fryer and were also amazing. You can order them filled with fish or beans and I recommend adding a little Marie Sharp's to them. I ordered the stew chicken entree for my main course. Stew chicken is a staple in Belize and they put almost all the pieces of the chicken in the pot (including the feet - but I guess they leave that out here). The entree came with coconut rice (also popular in Belize) and fried plantains. I love plantains and they were nice and soft. The rice was a tad bit dry and I was a little disappointed in the portion size of the chicken. But the chicken itself was delicious and the meat fell off the bone. Overall I had a nice throwback day to my time in Belize and appreciated the welcoming service. They serve breakfast as well so I need to stop in for some fry jacks another time."}
{"text":"I love Elvira's.  The food is authentic and delicious!  My go to items there are the Panades, Rice and Beans and Stew Chicken.  OMG!  It tastes just like home."}
{"text":"I had heard all the good reviews and wanted to try for a while. Finally tried it.  I am happy to have tried it.  I used a group on for a discount.  (love using those group on's.).  As an appetizer we ordered something that looked like tostada's (Panades).  It had shredded meat, tomatoes, and onions.  They served it with either a mild or hot serrano sauce.  Liked that sauce on it.  There was one per person.  I loved these things.  Two people ordered the Red Snapper.  It came whole and wow, it was good.  The beans and rice were a little dry and the plantains were a little mushy, but the fish stole the show.  Another person ordered the fried fish (it was a friday) and it had a different coating, but was tasty.  It was not as crisp as I would have liked.  The fries were standard fries.  Finally, I ordered what were basically corn tamales (Ducunu) but a Belizean version.  It came with stewed chicken.  That chicken fell off the bone.  The two tamales were awesome.  One was very filling. It came with a black bean side.  Again the plantains and banana was kind of mushy, but I still liked them.  Overall, I would go back again.  While I have never been to Belize and am not sure about how the food is supposed to taste, I did enjoy it."}
{"text":"Wow, just got back from dinner at Elvira's where we met friends and had a delightful enjoyable and relaxing dinner.  This was our first time here and all of us will agree we found a different and delicious new restaurant. Food created from Belize. Elvira's is large, but I know when the word really gets out this place won't be large enough.  The restaurant is a little north of Warner on Alma School. The decor is simple, but the seating was comfortable.  The wait staff was knowledgeable. He knew his menu and was very patient with all our questions.  Okay let talk about the food. We were a little disappointed that they ran out of ox tail because we all wanted to try it, but we all picked something else and none of us were disappointed .  My short ribs were perfect. The meat fell off the bone and it almost melted in my mouth.  Our waiter told us to use some of the sauce and pour it over the coconut rice.  It was really good.  Plantains if you never had them look like bananas, but they are much sweeter.  Mine was fried and wonderful. I liked them so much; I ordered another side of them.  My husband had the stewed chicken and like my ribs he said the meat was very tender. To some the fact that at this time there is no alcohol, only soda, water or their specialty drinks.  This restaurant is only 3 months old so they may be requesting an alcohol license. I didn't ask.  The guys would have liked a cold  beer, but the food was so good, I don't think it really mattered.  Okay here is the killer. So for two people full dinner, plus my extra order of plantains and dessert our bill without tip was $32.00 and change.  I am full and still have money to stop at the mall and buy that purse I have been drooling over. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Will I go back, of course  we already have plans to go back and try breakfast."}
{"text":"At first... we were a bit scared.  There was no one in the restaurant at 12:30 pm on a Sunday....  I am so glad we stayed.  We started with an appetizer called panades that we scarfed down so fast we had no time for a picture!  I know right! scandalous!!  The bean panadas were nice n spicy and so were the fish panadas. They was delicious!   We ordered the oxtail and red snapper.  The oxtail was a first for me and it was was tender and tasty.  The snapper was Super!!! Well spiced and grilled to perfection. I had a watermelon drink that balanced every thing.  Over all a great dining experience. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing spot authentic belizean food made me feel like I was a little kid in Belize in my mamitas kitchen.. Service was great nice friendly people, definitely coming again"}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect with this place. I guess it was off-hours when I went as there were not a lot of patrons. I decided to take a chance and my adventurous spirit was rewarded. Tried three different dishes and all were great!"}
{"text":"I would really rather give 3.5 stars but will be nice.  The watermelon drink was AMAZING!!!  Tried the Ducunu plate with beef.  The Ducunu was not good, the beans were okay and the plantains were delicious.  Tried a bite of my friends oxtail which was much more flavorful than my food.  I would try this place again."}
{"text":"If you want a delicious, home-cooked Caribbean meal in a relaxed atmosphere, this is your place. Family owned and operated with flavors brought right from the country of Belize. Don't come in, in a hurry. Have you ever known the Caribbean people to rush things? No way! Worth it though. We live in the neighborhood and have been wanting to try it out and it was worth it. We went for breakfast. Don't be fooled by the menu, which is pretty simple and seems like traditional breakfast. It is not traditional and has the most flavorful foods. Homemade biscuits, red beans, Elvira style eggs, homemade corned-beef hash, stewed chicken and more! Go in, talk with the owner, his wife and their daughter, enjoy the music and flavors of Belize."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service.  My son didn't like his original kids meal (because he's picky, not because it didn't taste good), they made him a new one quickly and without charge, without us even asking them to do so. Excellent food.  Oh my gosh, the Salbutes are AMAZING.  Think, truly awesome taco w/boiled chicken and (odd, but it totally works) parmesan cheese.  Not much to look at, but the FLAVOR! The short ribs are melt in your mouth delicious, and not overcooked (a lot of places they overcook them, and they sort of dry out, even though they're swimming in juices, but not here). So, so, so good.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I don't know where the 4 1/2 stars came from. If pictures say 1000 words, you tell me."}
{"text":"This was our first time here we tried the watermelon drink (which we will absolutely get again) for our entree we had the stew chicken (which was phenomenal) will definitely have that again, the meat fell off the bone like butter. HIDDEN GEM !!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! I went to Belize last summer and this food is definitely authentic. The staff is friendly and the food is delicious. We had the bean penadas a must try as well as the chicken stew and coconut rice which was to die for. The rice pudding and fresh Belizean juice was our desert. I will definitely return soon!"}
{"text":"Been dreaming about Belizean food since we had side of the road BBQ in Belize after going to Xunantunich. We found Elvira's and loved this place! Went while they had the BBQ, so we tried the BBQ chicken and Stewed chicken. Both were fantastic! We had the Salbutes as an appetizer, and we're definitely hooked. Washed it all down with a coconut water and a watermelon drink. Everything was delicious, will definitely be back! Love all the true Belizean flavor."}
{"text":"Summertime in Phoenix had hitherto been insufferable to me. Henceforth, I shall be immensely delighted when offered an opportunity to go to Phoenix at any time of year.   This change of heart has been effected by my discovery of Elvira's in Chandler. My palate, which was heretofore deprived of the splendors of Belizean cuisine, is now utterly taken with the deliciousness that is Elvira's, and yearns for a trip to the Southwest for another Belizean meal.  Y'all betta Belize all this!  The whole coconut drink, the watermelon drink, and the guava juice are instant refreshment in the southern Arizona heat. The salbutes are delightful little cousins to tostadas, and are a great starter. The stewed chicken is tender and full of flavor, and the Caribbean red snapper is some of the best preparations of the fish I've had in recent years. The whole red snapper is rubbed with spices that taste similar to the Jamaican jerk spice, and is shallow fried such that the exterior is crisp and the flesh is succulent. The entrees are served with a choice of seasoned coconut rice and beans or white rice and stew beans.    Elvira is a gracious host, and the overall vibe is bright and cheerful."}
{"text":"I trusted the reviews and they're right you have to get the fish & bean Panades. The Salbutes were amazing too! If you're not familiar with Panades they are deep fried filled with fish or beans topped with cabbage. The Salbutes are a tortilla style topped with a meat, avocado, tomato, cabbage. Both great appetizers! My main dish was the stewed chicken, fall off the bone. It's certainly a feel for home cooking or comfort food! Oh and try the watermelon drink"}
{"text":"Hey worst customer service at Elvira's Belizean Cafe. Poor service wait time was over 2 hrs. No waitresses or greeter when u enter restaurant. Ordered a watermelon drink never got it. Ordered food was told they did not have time to prepare since they already had a table of guests. Instead was given greasy panades.  Restaurant will be closed soon just like all the other restaurants that open great and end up closing due to lack of great service or difficulty operating a business. Check back."}
{"text":"Very tasty, great quality food and a wonderful friendly staff makes this place one of my favorites in Chandler. This place is a great alternative to the other typical choices for food in Chandler. Try it! You won't be disappointed! As a plus, the owner will tell you all about Belize and their culture :)"}
{"text":"I had never had Belizean food before, but I found this restaurant on Groupon and oh man it is a delight. I have been here twice, once for dinner and again for breakfast and both times they did not disappoint. The staff is friendly and helpful picking out food (I had no idea about Belizean food). The owner even came by the table to make sure we were doing alright and he was a very great guy. I would recommend the stewed chicken, it's wonderful. I will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Ordered oxtail off of uber eats and what I received was just ONE oxtail in a cup full of greasy broth, the dryest rice I've ever had, and cold bread pudding. I've been wanting to try this place for a while and I am so disappointed. This place is just a waste of money. Never again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. Elvira waited on us personally and hade some great recommendations. Give it a try - highly recommended"}
{"text":"Oxtails were very fatty and not seasoned as much as I thought they should be. The potato  salad was not good."}
{"text":"Never tried Belizean food until today, I ordered Coconut drink in shell and Chicken with potato salad, Belize rice with plantains.I normally will not eat potato salad but this potato salad was great. Chicken was fall off the bone good especially with the rice. I was in and out for $20. Very interesting staff from Belize. I recommend !"}
{"text":"If you're thinking about trying this place, do yourself a favor and come in. The food was amazing and I can't wait to go back. I've somehow never tried Belizean food before and now I regret not having known of it earlier.  I had a perfectly cooked chicken stew and was just blown away by how great it was.  Really can't recommend this place strongly enough."}
{"text":"This was the first time my nephew and I tried Belizean food. I would definitely eat at Elvira's again. It was a great dining experience!   The owner and his wife are extremely friendly and nice. The owner actually waited on us. He did a great job explaining the menu and making recommendations. We really loved the Salbutes! The combination of all ingredients was very tasty. I'd go back just for the Salbutes! I got the stewed chicken and my nephew ordered the ox tail. Both entrees were good but we both liked stewed chicken better. I can't wait to try something different next time."}
{"text":"Yes, I've had better FROM THIS RESTAURANT.  Before the portions were reasonable, the flavors good. This time the flavors were uninspired, even absent. And check my photo of the panades... not much filling there.  The prices were always a little steep, but the portions were always adequate and the flavors satisfying, so it was worth it.  So what the heck happened?  I loved this place the first few times we visited.  Now the portions are smaller, not much filling in the panades, and not much flavor in the sauces for the ducunu (which is just a masa roll, like a tamale without filling, so you need the sauces for flavor).  Today we ordered two samplers. Fish and bean panades, ducunu, and salbutes.  I do want to give them another chance. I normally wait a year between review updates, but next time I visit if they are back to the level from my first few visits I will update this review promptly."}
{"text":"Ordered a sampler platter and beef stew platter. Casual atmosphere but a little warm needed to turn up the ac. Also sign states save 3.8% if you paid cash. Not sure how I feel about that but luckily I had cash on me.  Service was incredibly slow for lunch and unfortunately made the mistake of coming here hungry at least 45 mins until food was delivered to table. Plantain was excellent and the beef was so tender. Potato salad eh could have done without. All in all good was good just wished service was better   Pretty sure only waitress and cook here when we arrived at 1 for lunch and there were probably 5 to 6 tables of people. More staff showed up around 2."}
{"text":"Good food. Nice owner. They need a liquor license and some changes to the lighting and a bar to nick up business."}
{"text":"Service was prompt and polite. I had the chicken stew which was tender and delicious.  DH had the ox tail which was tender and full of flavor.  We left full and satisfied due to the rice and beans but the protein servings could be a little larger.   We also tried the Ducunu.  It was very tender and moist reminding me of a sweet corn tamale."}
{"text":"Ordered the Panades for an appetizer, they were fabulous! Had the stew chicken plate as my meal and was so disapointed with the portion of chicken served. There was hardly any meat on the bone. Not worth 13.99."}
{"text":"Tried Belizean food for the first time tonight. Very much a fusion of the influences in the region. Salbutes are not to be missed, and order your own plate of two, because one each is just not enough and you won't want to share. Yum!!  Full bar. I had a nice frozen margarita. They carry Pepsi products, but managed to drum up a Coke in a bottle for my Husband that made him happy. Both of us had the short rub dinner. The broth someone has already mentioned and it is so dang GOOD!  The meat was tender and almost falling off the bone. Well seasoned and tasty, tender meat. The potato salad was mild and cool, which offset the Habanero hot sauce that I dotted on the rice. The beans and rice had a subtle flavor of coconut milk.    The owner was delightful and shared a little about his family. We really felt like guests. The music was relaxing, and karaoke was going to start shortly. This was such a nice mid-week break.  We will definitely be back.  They serve breakfast, too, so I will add to this post soon."}
{"text":"Didn't really know what food from Belize would consist of and it was amazing! The sabrotes are definitely worth stopping by!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and genuine!! I went to Belize 2 years ago and absolutely fell in love with Salbutes. The chicken is so flavorful and the tortilla maza is delicious beyond description."}
{"text":"Never had Belizean food or have heard of them and they're right in front of my building for 7 months. Finally made my way over there and it's so dang good! Chicken fell off the bone. I ordered tamales since it's the special right now and it's huge for $5.50! Why did I wait so long! I was skeptical at first didn't know what to expect. Owners are super nice."}
{"text":"Seen a few of people check in and mention the tender oxtail dish so it was a must try ! I've never eaten Belizean food before boy was it tasty I had the oxtail lunch dish with the coconut rice  kids had the tostadas and French toast. The ox tail was tender and flavorful so much I ordered another one separate to go double ox tail . The tostada was awesome I can't put finger on the base it's not hard like a mexican tostada but it's like a thinner fry bread it was awesome will be back !"}
{"text":"I love food from the Caribbean and had high hopes for this restaurant. It exceeded my expectations, primarily because of the service, which was friendly and attentive. There was this drink whose name I remembered from childhood, but I couldn't recall the taste. My friend wanted another drink altogether, but she wasn't quite certain either. Our server readily brought us samples to help us determine which selections we wanted to purchase. How helpful! The food was tasty, and the portions were generous. I'll definitely be returning with friends."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. The Red Snapper was perfect--crispy outside, soft and tender on the inside falling off the bone. The owners are so friendly, and you can tell that this restaurant is their passion. This is authentic Belizean food--I have paid much more for food that wasn't nearly as good, so I think the prices are very good as well!"}
{"text":"Had a Living Social voucher to use.  I've never had Belizean Food, but I love trying new foods.  Very nice owners who took the time to explain the different menu items.  They also have Caribbean music nights with dancing.  Karaoke nights as well on Fridays.  We will be back to try all the other menu items we didn't get to & to buy some of the habanero hot sauce.  We tried the salbutes & panades appetizers & split the fried chicken dinner.  All items were fresh made to order.  My only issue was the rice and beans were a little dry and they forgot our potato salad.  I forgot to take a picture of the fried chicken dinner."}
{"text":"First time here at Elvira's with my husband and it was delicious. We started of with the panades, fish and bean. They were very tasty, especially the sauce that came with it. My husband had the oxtail and loved it. I had the fried chicken. It was cooked perfect and the skin was super crispy. I forgot to mention my watermelon drink came in an actual watermelon. So yummy!"}
{"text":"Fry jack bread. I'm sooo happy right now. One piece comes with breakfast. Then it's a 1$ per extra.  Look how big and fresh they are. Omg!!  Elvira's style eggs are sweet and interesting but it's good.  Corn beef hash is homemade. A little fatty for me. My buddy scarfed them down.  Short ribs are fatty for me but again my buddy scarfed then Down and is happy.  Coconut rice, potato salad l, fried bananas and beans are fantastic.  I give five stars not because the food is amazing cuisine but it's exactly what you'd get in Belize and the food preparation must be a pain.  Yes we will come back. Yes we will recommend.  Keto friendly. No. Carb heaven. Yes."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate that I'm giving this place 3 stars because it could have been so much better.  Came here with my boyfriend on a Saturday around 1pm. We stood at the front table for a good 5-10 minutes before anyone came to seat us. There were 3 other small parties there. We could see that there were only 2 people working - one in the kitchen and one in the front. The waitress was actually very nice - it just took forever.  I got the oxtail plate and my boyfriend got the stewed chicken plate. The oxtail itself was amazing, better than the stewed chicken in my opinion. The coconut rice was pretty dry so I put the sauce from the oxtail in it and it made it better. Potato salad was bland. Fried plantains were not fried enough.  I loved the oxtail but I don't see myself coming here again."}
{"text":"I had a great lunch here with my daughter. It is a very family friendly place with wonderful food and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant with friendly staff. Food was flavorful and I highly recommend the coconut and watermelon juices! We had the stewed chicken and the meat fell off the bone. I love that it's a small business too. Decor is cute and unpretentious."}
{"text":"The salbute and watermelon drink were my favs but all good and left feeling like I got good nutrition"}
{"text":"Great food!!! Being Belizean an authentic Belizean restaurant has been long over due in  AZ. A must try!!  First timers try stewed chicken."}
{"text":"My first visit here was awesome! I had a sample of different appetizers: rice and beans, salbutas, plantains, and a taste of the oxtail. All of them were fantastic!! I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"There are not many belizean places to eat in Arizona. On top of that there are not many places that have good customer service. No matter how bad the food is good customer service make a place worth going to. This place has BOTH good food and good service! The owners are humble sweet people. Catered to all our many request. They chatted with us, and you can tell they have a passion for what they do. Its rare to find people who are passionate about their work. Bless their hearts.  I came there with 2 of my belizean co-workers and they just gushed at how the food brought them way back to their roots. The closes thing to home cooking. Belizean food is quite similar to filipino food so i loved it right away!  We ordered the Fry Jack, which was light and fluffy together with some beans. We also tried the bean panadas and the fish panadas. They were amazing. We literally had 3 orders of that. For our main meal we ate the oxtail with rice, plantains and a side of potato salad. It was the best meal ever. The oxtail was nice and soft, It went well with the rice. The potato salad was so good, it reminded me of the ones you would eat at a family gathering. Of course we had to have dessert to top our meal off. We ordered the bread pudding. Im not a fan of bread pudding at all, but when I tried it. OMG, I almost finished the whole thing! It wasn't too sweet. I cant explain it, it was just amazing.   Here's the thing we all have different preferences and taste buds. However, I always say give it a try before I form an opinion. I hope everyone gets a chance to not only eat here but also meet the owners."}
{"text":"Tried their beef ribs. Scrumptious melt in your mouth! Loved the plantains. Great potato salad. The rice and beans were my least fave \"just because,\" but the gravy from the ribs made them perfect. Will be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food, and our server was very nice, spent some time with us discussing the menu and possible options for dinner.  Started with salbutes, had stewed chicken (with beans and rice, plantains, potato salad) and a soursop drink. Really enjoyed it. Docked just one star as the chicken was a little dry. However, the gravy was fantastic. Really enjoyed the atmosphere and the friendliness as well. We will be coming back. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I love when food is authentic. Elvira's Belizean café is delicious. Family run establishment with good customer service.   My waiter introduced me to the items on the menu that I wasn't familiar with but I went with the friend chicken that I saw online and it WAS crispy and delicious . Been wanting crispy chicken all week!  It's a must do. Go eat at Elvira's!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious but took over an hour from the time we ordered and my food came out last after everyone was nearly finished. They had karaoke in the dining room during dinner hours which was strange and felt out of place.  Would definitely try again as the food was truly spectacular."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday around 5p.  They was a special guest entertainer/singer warming up for the show later in the evening.  He was blasting his music so loud we could hear it across the parking lot.  We walked in to see the restaurant, turned around and walked out because the music was the volume of a concert at Talking Stick arena.  A lady ran out and asked why we were leaving.  We told her and she said she would have him turn down the music.   He turned it down by 10%, LOL.  Service:  Good  Appetizers: Good  Main course:  We both had stewed chicken.  Two TINY pieces of chicken (mostly bones) soaking in a bowl of OIL.  Good potato salad, greasy plantains and bland coconut rice with beans.  We were very disappointed based on the high rating.  We will not return."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with the food and the service. First, I stood in the restaurant for at least 8 minutes before someone came from the back. Actually, I had to go behind the counter and ring the bell after yelling, \"Hello\" several times! I got the oxtails and  pigtails and tamales. Maybe I'm just use to Jamaican oxtails, but these were bland and had way too much fat on them. I know oxtails are fatty, but you could take the time to trim some of it off. I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"This place is massive! We went Friday night at 6pm and the dinner crowd was quite thin. We were promptly seated and our drink orders came quickly and were soon ready to order. I chose the fish sandwich, my husband got the chicken stew with rice. Dinner was okay, the fish was a bit plain and wasn't seasoned at all which was the point of trying this resturant. My husband was satisfied with his food, however we agreed we won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"Very good food and service.   The food is authentic.   The owner is super nice.  The price is very reasonable.  Lots of customers while eating they and they all seem to be enjoying the food and environment as much as I do."}
{"text":"Newly opened. Great friendly and helpful staff. I tried the oxtail really tasty. Also try the rice pudding. They also serve breakfast. Well worth a visit"}
{"text":"Food was delicious .Red snapper with coconut rice ,.Just awesome food guys.I'd love to go back again..my wife took stew chicken and she was very much impressed too..nice ambience courtesy staff.."}
{"text":"Started with soursop juice, which I had never had.  What a refreshing drink.  Tangy and sweet but not in an overwhelming way.  Had chicken stew for main, which hit the spot, along with the salbutes - kind of like a tostada, but more flavorful.  Family-owned and run.  Went in over Memorial Day weekend, so the place was quiet.  But I could see it getting busy on a regular weekend.  Nice experience - recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Had the fish panades. Delicious seasoning and flavor. Texture was crisp, but fish was still moist. Will order this anytime I go back."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! We had the oxtail and chicken dinner. Both were so tender and flavorful.  Also the beans & fish panadas were wonderful for appetizer."}
{"text":"I just got done eating lunch at Elvira's Belizean Cafe with my 7yo and 4yo as part of their \"Summer Around the World\" project.  It was great!  We ordered the stewed chicken plate, the salbutes, panades and the garnaches.  It was so good and my daughter told the waiter it was \"the best food ever\".  For drinks we got the watermelon juice (which the girls absolutely loved) and the sour sap which was creamy and refreshing! The service was fast and friendly and the waiter took the time to explain the dishes and make his recommendation which I really appreciated.  I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great family owned restaurant with great service.    We enjoyed the tender Oxtail and the chicken.  Well worth the stop.  The meal came with rice and potato salad and fried plantains.  Was very good.  I can't wait to go back and try the fish   We tried two beverages that were Guava and Soursap which was anything but sour.   They were delicious and we wanted more."}
{"text":"Found this little gem here on Yelp and I'm here to add to her 5 STAR consistency!  We brought a group of seven here after church last Sunday and were blown away at the deliciousness.  FYI - the oxtail is prepped to be served later in day but we went with Short Ribs, Stewed Chicken, Fish and our oddball went with the Biscuits and Gravy with Pancakes (omg- so good).  Wish I started with Lemon Meringue Pie since we were so stuffed we passed but did drink down a super tasty Watermelon Drink.  My Hearts on Fire for Elvira!  She's there and super sweet and attentive...try it you'll like it!!"}
{"text":"Food and service are amazing, went here with a couple friends on an off chance.  We were going to another restaurant, however, the smell from Elvira's lured us in. We were so happy with making this decision to try the restaurant.  The food is all made from scratch; not a single item on this menu that we tried was pre-made. My Friends had the chicken and I had the ox tail, both which were amazing. Additionally, we had two appetizers, the open face chicken one, which I could make a total meal in of its self.  The two deserts we tried were the lemon meringue, and sweet potato pie . Both lemon meringue and the sweet potato pie tasted like heaven. However out of the two pies, I thoroughly enjoyed the sweet potato pie more because it had a more of a pumpkin pie taste which was truly delightful! The service here was spectacular and the lady who owned the restaurant whose name is Elvira, is such a delight and could easily tell that she took pride in everything here at her restaurant and she even surpassed the infamous one year mark which in the restaurant world is absolutely incredible. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. Had to wait a little while for our food but definitely worth the wait.  I ordered the short ribs and my husband ordered the stewed chicken - both were yummy but we fought over the chicken -  We will come back for sure and try more stuff"}
{"text":"Delicious food and very kind staff! I had the red snapper and a watermelon drink and they were both very good. Others at my table had oxtail, chicken, beef and all were very good."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is fresh and authentic. I've tried the chicken Dinner and oxtails Dinner and I'm not done yet. Would I tell my friends... Yessss everyone and their ma'am ;)"}
{"text":"First time customer, totally loved the food and the friendly staff. My favorite was the watermelon drink!!! Totally coming back!!! The Caribbean music was amazing. Very comfortable seats and laid back atmosphere. Come on over you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Very delicious food, excellent customer service, very authentic experience. I definitely recommend to anybody the Phoenix area. Prices are pretty much industry standard $10-$20 dollars a plate depending what you order. They have a service fee $1.28 if you don't pay cash. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"As my girlfriend and i sit and enjoy the stewed beef, fried chicken, the fried platanos, potatoe salad and rice and beans i told her i have to give this place a great review. And here it is, this is a must try for anyone looking for something exotic and new. The enviorment is calm and serene, the staff was very helpful with what is in their menu. The fresh coconut water in the shell was refreshing. The fried chicken was delightful and non greesy, the stewed beef was juicy and tender. And for those who like to put a kick in their meal, you must try their Belizean hot sauce, great taste. Im going to suggest this place to all my friends. Thank you Elviras for a great dinning experience."}
{"text":"This place was EXCELLENT!! The food and service was wonderful. We ate so fast we forgot to take pictures. We ordered an appetizer that was stuffed with fish and another stuffed with beans which came with a fish sauce; sorry I forgot the name. My fiancé ordered a short rib plate with the coconut rice and beans. I ordered the oxtail plate with white rice and beans. The coconut rice and beans is much more flavorful. This place is new and worth the try. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We are so happy we finally decided to try the Elvira's Belizean Cafe! Having been to Belize, this food is very authentic, you can taste the love Elvira puts into each dish. The service could not have been better, very friendly and we were checked on all of the time when they were busy. Highly recommend the stew chicken, pig tail, ducunu, panades, and the garnaches were so tasty! We will now be regulars here, we love supporting great food local food!"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos! All three are amazing. They have special imported cheese and it make all the difference.  The shells are similar to Indian fry bread, and is excellent!  Family run place. Very good!"}
{"text":"I really did not want to write this  because  I  want mom &  pop businesses  to succeed having been an owner myself BUT....this visit last night  was the  lousiest  restaurant  experience I  have  ever had in  my long  life.   We arrived  at  5:30 and there  were 2 tables already occupied  plus,  and  this  very important,  a group  of about 25 at one big  table.  This  large table was probably the primary reason  for  what  I am  about  to tell you.     We  were seated  immediately  and  asked for drink orders  and the  menu explained.   This  is  important because  Belizean  food is not well  known  and we had little idea what was what.  So  far so  good.     It  took perhaps  a  good  30  minutes  for our drinks to arrive  and  despite one  alcoholic  drink ordered it  never came.  Another 30  minutes or so and  someone showed up  to  take  our  order.   We  then waited another  30-45 minutes for our  food  to  show  up  and  it  was  delivered in several  segments with the earliest being finished before the next was delivered.  Two of the four orders  never made  it and we ended up getting them in a to-go bag.     Meanwhile the  table  of 25 were also getting their  orders in the same manner - one at a time and widely spaced.   One smaller table got up to leave obviously and understandably very displeased.  The kitchen  was obviously overwhelmed with orders however we did  notice  another late arriving  table was already finished with their dinner before we  were even  served.   We finally finished  about  8PM - 2 1/2 hours for a very simple dinner.   Absolutely unacceptable!  I had  no expectations of what the food might be  but  the menu isn't overwhelming and that  is  exactly what  I  got.  All four of us  got something  different.   Main dish (fish filled tortilla) was  just OK but portions  were small and the fried  banana slices (2 small) and rice (sides) were  virtually  tasteless. Both ladies in our group of 4 said their dinners were good (one had Red  Snapper  and  the other chicken stew).   The stew  was  very expensive for what  it  was (several veggies  and one chicken thigh, not deboned).  There  was  just  one person waiting tables  although two others  were seen doing other tasks.  Definitely not  enough staff on hand.  We were  never visited by wait staff for drink  refills or to ask  if food was OK.   When we finally tracked waiter  down to ask about food order he promised to answer but never did.   We did  hail him down one time and he brought  a child's plate for the six-year old in our group long before the rest of our food was ready.  I won't  be  back  but do have several suggestions for the owners.  Get your kitchen  capable of handling  a dinner crowd or post a warning on your door that waiting time  will  be long.  And  get a bartender capable of mixing simple drinks or don't advertise  offering them.     Had we realized  the  large  table had not been served  when we arrived we would have gone next door to the Thai restaurant and been home at a reasonable hour."}
{"text":"Some ethnic restaurants are intended to serve their local neighborhood, but Elvira's can't be one of these.  I mean, how many Belize natives live in that part of Chandler?  So I have to assume it desires to attract the general population, like me.  And it did, because it looks good on paper - interesting menu, good reviews, even coupons.  But Elvira's did not live up to the expectation for this type of establishment.  The much-ballyhooed salibutes were so salty as to be almost inedible.  And the crust was soggy too.  There was very little meat in the chicken stew (one of their three most popular dishes according to the server, along with oxtail and snapper), although the flavor was good.  The plantains tasted good but were too hard (probably too green to start with).  And the sweet potato pudding desert was cloying sweet and grainy.  At least at night, when Elvira's was almost deserted, the huge room with its airplane-hanger high ceilings and widely-spaced tables was cavernous and uninviting.  On the positive side, the whole fried snapper was perfectly cooked and of good size, and the flavors were generally bold and comfortable at the same time, a neat trick.  The service was pleasant too.  I stretched a point to rate Elvira's three stars mostly because I wanted it to be better and because I love diversity in restaurants, but ..."}
{"text":"Great home cooked food that heals the soul. Great environment and fresh endless staff."}
{"text":"Had the short ribs entree with coconut rice,  potato salad and plantains. It was juicy, delicious and not too filling. Good portion size and loved the watermelon juice drink! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Finally made it over to Elvira's for lunch and was not disappointed!! We started with an order of the Salbutes...which we will definitely order again as an appetizer. I had the oxtail plate and my husband had the Ducunu plate with stewed chicken.  Everything was super flavorful and the meat was extremely tender. There were several items we still want to try and can't wait for our next visit!  Great for lunch or dinner and they have a breakfast menu as well."}
{"text":"My first time here. The staff was friendly and efficient. I ordered the stewed chicken with coconut rice.  The food was excellent. I didn't realize the beans would be mixed with the rice. But still, more than satisfied."}
{"text":"I had the Stewed Chicken and my wife had the Salbutes.  We had an appetizer, but I don't recall what it was called.  It was fried corn tortillas topped with refried beans and onion salsa (I think).  Whatever it was, it was pretty good.  The food was good.  The stewed chicken was fork tender served in a delicious thin gravy, which I poured on the dry but flavorful coconut rice.  There were delicious fried plantains on the plate, and some kind of potato salad in a small dish (I don't care for potato salad, so I won't review it).  The portions were not very filling, but it may have been because I had skipped lunch that day (and turned my nose up at the \"potato salad\").  I had a taste of the Salbutes that my wife ordered and they were amazing!  The service was excellent.  Our server was very friendly and informative.  The menu is kind of limited, and our early dinner was a bit more than I would have expected to pay (over $40 with tip).  Overall I was a \"little\" disappointed, but that is based mostly on the portion size and the price.  Other than that I would recommend this place.  If anything, it is unique and was a nice distraction from the usual fare offered here in the East Valley.  I know of Belize, but never knew there was a \"Belizean Cuisine\".  We will probably return and give it another try, making sure to order more food next time!"}
{"text":"Extremely good food!  I ordered about 6 or 7 different items including an entree which was stew chicken and everything was phenomenal.  I've always seen the groupon and scrolled past it but today my gf and I decided to give it a shot. Great atmosphere and ridiculous food.  Literally the best meal I've had in months. I would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"I ordered the oxtail plate and my mom ordered the stew chicken... we loved it. I would take the white rice and beans over the coconut mixed rice and beans but neither is a bad choice. Definitely coming back here and bringing my dad when he comes to visit. The space is huge and decorated with Belize flags all while Belizean music plays in the background."}
{"text":"Great café our family had a wonderful meal here and enjoyed our time the host and hostess were very kind and any questions we had they were happy to answer. We had the oxtail and the pork both were cooked to perfection. We will be going back to try out the other items on their menu. Definitely try their watermelon drink or the guava both were very good. This place is kind of a hidden gem"}
{"text":"My first visit to this restaurant this weekend.  We ordered 2 3-piece fried chicken dinners with the beans, rice, and plantains.  Everything was fresh and cooked to order, and the chicken pieces were generous-sized.  Very friendly and accommodating service."}
{"text":"Amazing can't wait to go back!! The fish was on point just enough flavors. The prices were good! And the atmosphere was welcoming"}
{"text":"Came for lunch. Had the chicken stew with coconut rice and beans. Delicious! The chicken just fell of the bone. It was so tender and the broth from the stew was excellent. Give this place a try. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have never had Belizean food before but this is absolutely amazing !!  We had the oxtail and stewed chicken they were so flavorful and tasted just like home cooking. We had coconut rice as well as rice and beans they had great flavors to it as well. They were playing reggae music when we walked in the people there we're extremely friendly.  We can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our dinner last night at Elvira's. The owners came over first to explain the menu. We enjoyed the flavors, textures, and overall quality of most items we selected. Service was good."}
{"text":"Don't pass up Elvira's Belizean cafe when you're in the Chandler area! The oxtail is to die for, the stewed chicken is so yummy if you don't like meat. Don't miss out on trying the specialty drinks - watermelon drink in Arizona!!"}
{"text":"The classic breakfast was excellent. The service was excellent. The price was very reasonable. Will go back regularly :)"}
{"text":"Food and service was great! Can't wait to take my mom! Make sure you get the watermelon drink and coconut drink but leave room for the great food also!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and I wanted to give an honest shot before I reviewed. I've been to Belize (Cayo, Toledo, Orange Walk, Belize City, Ambergris) and the food offered here falls short in every category. Not sure what season they use for the stewed meats but it's like no recado I have ever come across. The meats are too chewy and the rice beans are over cooked. Plantains were cold. The coconut flavor in the rice tastes artificial. Call me biased but I have had the best and this will not suffice."}
{"text":"Be prepared for an authentically wonderful meal.  The owner took the time to walk us through the menu and helped us with selections while sharing information on his beloved Belizean culture.  The watermelon drink, stewed chicken and bread pudding were just amazing!  Great flavors that I will definitely come back for."}
{"text":"We waited to be seated while the waitress just looked, we eventually seated ourselves. After sitting we waited a good 5 minutes for the waitress. We got no suggestions, no warm welcome. We ordered the selbutes and panades, the panades were EXTREMELY oily the salbutes were salty and just not good at all. We then went on to order the stew chicken and the oxtails, both with coconut rice and potato salad. The meat was ok but very fatty, the rice however was the most driest rice I've ever had and the potato salad was bland. The cherry on top was the ridiculous prices for the portions they give. I regret going here instead of going down the block to chase diner (which is awesome)."}
{"text":"We decided to try out this place after the all the rave reviews on yelp, and boy this place definitely did not disappoint me! The owner was really friendly and took time to walk us through the different items on the menu since this was our first time trying this cuisine. His recommendation were excellent. We took one ducunu plate with chicken stew and a red snapper plate.  Ducunu plate review: The ducunus are made of corn and it was delicious! The chicken was juicy and cooked to perfection. The meat was just falling off the bone! It came with a side of plantains and beans. The beans were just ok, but compliments the dish.The plantains were the perfect way to finish dinner! Red snapper plate review: The plate came with a huge snapper and side of coconut rice & potato salad. The fish was excellent, marinated, seasoned & cooked perfectly! My husband loves fish and he thoroughly enjoyed this one. Totally worth the price. Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Just had a beautiful spinach salad with chicken that was made specially for us by the chef!!!! Great service and I will be back to try the classic  Belizean food... the setting is comfortable clean and calm. Do give these folks with a new idea and a brand new restaurant a visit.  You will not be sorry."}
{"text":"Definitely a great surprise! Just driving by and decided to stop in for brunch with my wife. This is my new favorite breakfast! I had the beef with scrambled Belizean eggs. Fantastic and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"\"I want to give people a taste of the Caribbean and show them the fun side of me\". ? Rihanna  Elvira's Belizean Cafe is the Rihanna of Chandler f'sho!  So we stopped in after seeing an ad for this place on the Yelp app a million times.  We ordered the panades [four for $4], the ox tail plate [$13.99], the short rib plate [$12.99], a watermelon juice [$4.95], and coconut juice [$4.95].  It was a pretty dang tasty dinner!  For the panades, they offer fish, beans, or both. Since it was my first time here, we got two of each but I would definitely recommend the fish over the beans. Yum!  These are like empanadas made with masa (corn) and served with a cabbage, onion, and pepper salsa.  Definitely use the salsa and ask for some Belizean hot sauce on the side.  I've never tried panades before and I would definitely come back for the fish panades again!  Now look away.  Don't look at me.  I'm gonna suck the meat off these ox tails and I don't need you to judge me.  The meat was so tender and fatty.  They were perfectly braised.  Oh man!  Those ox tails got me feelin' some kinda way!  The coconut rice was sweet and fluffy and had beans in it and was topped with coconut flakes.  The fried plantains were glistening in its own sugars and felt like a very rich side.  As for the potato salad, it was slightly sweet and creamy.  I think the potato salad also had eggs in it too. So keep in mind that three fourths of your dinner platter has sweet components.  I wish one of the sides were more savory.  I think I'll ask for the white rice with the stew beans next time.  As amazing as the ox tails were, the short ribs were a bit dry and tough.    The drinks, while tasted great, I'd probably skip.  $4.95 for a coconut is a bit of a rip off when you can go to the Asian market but we were wanting it and had thought they would at least cut the top off so we can scoop out the meat.  Yeah.... they don't do this.  So save your $5 and buy some booze.  Elvira's Belizean Cafe is a huge restaurant and it's all super clean.  I'd love to stop in again and maybe try the whole fried snapper or the fried chicken!  Service is great, food is good, 4-stars all around!"}
{"text":"The food is so good ordered the fried chicken dinner and it was on point! The watermelon juice was so good and fresh, rice and beans sooooo good!!! Taste just like the food in Belize. This place is a must try!! Coming back for the shrimp omelette and the snapper. This is going to be my regular spot!"}
{"text":"Saturday, early dinner.  I ordered red snapper, wife had stewed pork chop. Snapper was delicious.crispy skin, flaky white meat, lightly seasoned. Coconut rice was fine, rather bland. Potato salad was good, tasted familiar. Wife's pork chop was okay.  Seasonings here are not out of the ballpark.  Our server, a young man was very nice. Place was nice and clean. 50$, including the tip. Can't say we were overwhelmed. Don't know if we'll be back."}
{"text":"If you're in the area, it's best that you eat at Elvira's. The Belizian twist on Caribbean food is wonderful, and they do it with love and extraordinary, intense flavors. The Belizian breakfast is a wonderful treat. Perfect scrambled eggs with stewed chicken falling off the bone, and scented with a heavenly mystery of spices. With a light, crispy bread on the side, I found my new favorite breakfast."}
