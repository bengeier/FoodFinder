{"text":"There's a golden light that scintillates from this place. It knows of hygiene and cleanliness. I am appreciative. Though, the patissier here is a pretentious she with a head so large I wonder how it fits through the door every morning (figuratively speaking). I walked in to order macarons, this lady did not blink once to withhold her tongue to promptly correct my accent, suggesting I didn't roll my 'r' the way the french do.
I'm sorry, I thought I lived in Toronto, a predominantly English-speaking city. Jussayin'.
Might I just add, I am fully bilingual, and her accent did not at all come close to the real pronunciation (smh). 
And then this lady proceeded to say: \"Any self-respecting pastry chef knows how to say macaron the correct way\" 
It was callous, and condescending, making me feel very uncomfortable, and belittled. NOT the way a business owner should treat their valuable customers.
She must've had God on her side that day. If there wasn't a glass counter filled with maca'R'ons between us, I would've fed her a few open palm wake-up calls. So, though their product may deserve an extra star than I gave credit for, she abates that rating with her temperament, disposition, and ego...WHICH I BELIEVE IS FAIR. You review a business based upon not only their products, but also their service. 
I got my macarons, the only one worth paying for is the mocha flavoured one, the rest are deplorable, the texture is not what a macaron should be. For someone who is so confident in their macaron expertise, she really falls short in her abilities to prove that. Their viennoiseries such as the croissants are super fluffy & buttery, overly so almost. It oozed transfats. They really do live up do their moniker, 'Butter Avenue'.
Just because of her, I'd never return. I'm not trying to go places where I'm disrespected and treated like I've committed the worst crimes known to man.

Tip: Go early, they're ALWAYS sold out of their non-macaron items...or DON'T if you don't want to start your day off with a rude glare and a generally sour note."}
{"text":"Macarons are so delicious!!!!!! Downside is that this place is not so  convenient for me. The tarts are not that good though (especially compared to some other places) their macarons are amazing though. I love the lychee raspberry, still have to try the salted caramel here. During Easter season I ordered the egg hunt tart, it tasted a bit like soap...."}
{"text":"What more can I say.. I LOVE their macaroons!!! And so do my co-workers when I bring their macaroons over to work. I come here every now and then when I crave for macaroons. They're chewy and never stale, also not too sweet or overly filled. My favorite flavour is white chocolate strawberry :)

Their tea is quite amazing as well! Grab one and it goes very well with the macaroons."}
{"text":"After 3 years hunting for unique and classic macarons all over Toronto I still come back to this place. Not only are the macarons are the best I love the professional service. 

I recommend the raspberry,  matcha, salted caramel and pumpkin spice macaron!"}
{"text":"OMG I was really craving some macarons so I went on yelp and I found this place and I really love this place the macarons are soo good! I really recommend this place your your macarons cravings 
*:.?. o()o .?.:*"}
{"text":"Very clean and simple. I loved the different varieties of flavour. Made me want to try all of them. I have a preference for friuty flavours and my favourite was lemon and passion fruit! They tasted amazing. 
Its approx 2.25 a macaron so it can get expensive if u buy alot but I think its worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Friendly staff who are willing to take their time to explain the different flavours of macarons and cakes. After the lady was done packaging the deserts, I realized that I forgot to to tell her that we are looking for gelatine free and alcohol free deserts. Without hesitating she right away explained that one of the macaron has gelatine in it and replaced it with another. She went on to explain that all other macarons are gelatine and alcohol free. Since the purchase was a gift and we wouldn't have the opportunity to try them for ourselves, we were given the opportunity to try a free macaron! Loved this place. It's clean and quiet. Will definitely be returning. You guys need to try the salted caramel macaron. It was so good!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of macarons, I often find them more sweet than what I like it to be. However I must say my friend has wonderful taste in choosing the flavours because for the most part, I enjoyed them more than usual, and in general I don't find Butter Avenue's macarons to be overly sweet. Of the ones i have tried, I must say my fave would be tomato brie! There's also street parking within residential streets so no need to pay~!"}
{"text":"I recently read great reviews about this place during Macaron Day in Toronto. I am an avid customer at Moroco Chocolat in Yorkville but wanted to try something new.

I was amazed at how delicious their macarons were. Some flavours I tasted and relished were White Chocolate Strawberry, Dark Chocolate, Cream Cheese Passionfruit, Mount Blanc (chocolate hazelnut), and the Sea Salt Caramel. My friend really enjoyed the Lemon and Lychee Raspberry flavours.

Also, the service was fantastic. Everyone is very warm and friendly. Highly recommend this gem on yonge street for any dessert lovers out there!"}
{"text":"Awesome macaroons and great service. Quaint little place to just sit back and enjoy their tasty treats. Sea salt caramel and pumpkin spice is to die for. Came here to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday and she loved it. Thanks to Calvin for helping me make the day specia.l Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Best macarons ever !A very good place to hang out with friends if you want a quiet place. The service is great."}
{"text":"New French-inspired cafe that opened a week ago. Their speciality are macrones, a small French pastry in different flavors with a filling. They taste delicious, the coffee / espresso / cappucino is great. Friendly service, minimalistic design with a couple of tables to linger. Prices are average (about 3 Dollars for a cappucino). As the macrones and the other French cakes are made all from organic ingredients the prices for the pastry are a bit higher (although absolutely OK compared to French prices)."}
{"text":"Have passed by so many times but never got a chance to go in til now and the set up is so simple but its all about the desserts right? So i order the St. Honore mango + 6 macarons (pistachio, matcha, salted caramel, lychee and raspberry, earl grey and lavender). The cream in the mango tart was sooo good! Didnt taste like artificial mango and smelt so delicious. There were a couple macarons ontop as well (lemon and mango i think- cant remember). The box of 6 macarons i took home and even after a day in the fridge they were very fresh and the texture was spot on."}
{"text":"Dale a tu cuerpa alegria Macarons!  It's not the Macarena, but the Macarons at Butter Avenue will make you want to dance.  The texture is kind of chewy, but not stick to your teeth chewy.  There are many flavors to choose from; they are all good.  My favorite is sea salt caramel.

Don't forget to pair it with a cup of their wonderful coffee.  I had 2 Americano's inside of 20 minutes there.  If I had stayed any longer, I would have been bouncing off the walls.  It's a very nice place by the way: very zen.

I have to agree with Gary S. on the boxes (even though my friend had a tough time figuring out how to put it together).  Proprietors Calvin and baker Tina are very talented. Well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Butter Avenue is probably my favourite place to get macarons. I've been here a few times and I'm never disappointed. Their macarons are always moist and the flavours are fantastic. I love the way they melt in my mouth! My favourite flavour would definitely have to be the earl grey; it's not too sweet and the flavour is subtle and not overwhelming.
This year, I finally got to try their limited edition \"Box of Hearts\" macarons which were amazing! Not only were they incredibly cute, the macarons themselves were delicious. Although it was a bit pricy, I think they're definitely worth trying at least once.
The interior of the shop is nice and bright and the seating is located next to the window, which is great on a sunny day. 
The staff are always nice and welcoming, and I have never encountered any issues with them. I'd definitely recommend Butter Avenue to all the macaron lovers out there!"}
{"text":"Good service , good food but the setting of the restaurant is very simple . Doesn't give you a \"cafe\" feeling"}
{"text":"OMGi have to say something~i just got 2 boxes Macarons form there. Their staff was so handsome and  nice. XD

i was not sure to choose which flavor at that time. The staff suggested the Earl Grey one to me and gave a free one to tried it, very good customer service will go there again."}
{"text":"I had had the best macorons in Paris.  Butter Avenue, by far, makes the best macorons in Toronto.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Deviously delicious, freshly made macaroons! Inside filling is succulent with a delicate thin shell. Came here for takeout. Packaging is beautiful wrapped. 

Service was just a bit slow, but otherwise no complaints"}
{"text":"This is a must-try for all macaron lovers! Each bite feels \"buttery\", and the flavours are on point."}
{"text":"I had heard many raving reviews about this place so I thought I would check it out. The macarons was great, but it was the hygienic part of the process where I was thrown off. The lady who was serving us had the white glove on to pick out the macarons, which is great, but it was while she was waiting for me to decide on the flavour she clasped her bare hand with the white glove hand. I don't know where her bare hand has been, but it touched the white glove where you are touching my macarons. I don't think I will return until there is a stricter protocol."}
{"text":"This if one of my top choices whenever I am craving for sweets. My favourite is their sea salt caramel, it is SO GOOD! The sea salt caramel is a must try! 

Other flavours I really like: Green tea, earl grey, lavender 

The macarons are $2.25 each, and $13.50 for a box of 6 
The cakes are around $7. The mango tart and the pistachio tart has two macarons on them each, so $7 seems reasonable since the macarons are priced $2.25 each.

The green tea cake has one macaron on it. Then, there are some cakes with no macarons on it."}
{"text":"This place has the best  Macarons in town. Every single flavor I tried there was awesome, especially earl grey and matcha. 
The decor and branding in there is very clean and modern. A good place for having a tea time with friends. 

Love this place~"}
{"text":"Very nice and simple place...it definitely has the best Macaron in town. 

Dropped by today to pick up some mini ones $7.50 plus tax...super super cute!!! Apparently they still have the heart-shaped ones available for $20 bucks. Matcha is my fav...since it is supposed to be full with antioxidant :P  They really melt in your mouth. Macaron is $2.25 each; cake slice is over $8 per slice...a bit on the pricey side.  Great service, and the staff is very friendly and helpful. For sure is a cool place to chill...except it is kinda out of the way of any major shops/attractions/interactions. 

Didn't have a chance to try any drinks there, will do next time :)"}
{"text":"This is one of the good bakeris in Toronto but with some cons.
It only serves Macaron and cakes. The price is super hi, the sitting area is like a DQ, and the working hours are very limited. 
The cakes are awesome. Macarons are good."}
{"text":"After eating my fair share of macarons from patisseries in Paris (Pierre Herme and Laduree) and from New York (Francois Payard, La Maison du Macaron and Bouchon bakery) I can say Butter Avenue makes one of the best tasting macarons around. Great distinct flavours, my two favourites are the white chocolate strawberry and the lemon. Cakes are fabulous too, I tried the foret blanche, it had a rich vanilla mousse with a layer of sour raspberry to cut the sweetness. They serve an excellent coffee as well. The decor is minimalist with warmth, a comfortable atmosphere to have a coffee and desserts. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Loved their wide selection of macaron flavours; they're all so perfectly crafted too. A bit pricey but still really good. The matcha flavoured ones are amazing. 

The gentlemen who greeted my friend and I were very welcoming and greeted us with smiles. 

Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Very good macaron selection. Earl Grey is amazing.

Atmosphere is bad, restaurant is cold and uninviting. Can't tell if it is open or closed from the street. The counter is way at the back.

The white walls were all scuffed up. Finishes within the store were very poorly executed. Needed some colour and flowers to warm up the space.

The macaron cake in the window was falling apart. 

Don't think it'll last..."}
{"text":"Personally I do enjoy eating their macaroons

They may not be the authentic macaroons, but I think they have their own unique qualities about them. First off these are chilled macaroons, since they use a butter cream filling instead of a ganache. Which was interesting I do like chilled sweets so that was nice.There was a great variety of flavors! Many macaroon shops in Toronto do not have as many, for the unique-ness of the flavors each shop has their own. This place has pumpkin spice, hazelnut cranberry, popcorn and many other different flavors (some may be limited time or seasonal). They also sell mini-macaroons and  on valentines day they have heart shaped ones.
The macaroon cookie has a crunchy outside and soft centre which is great.

Note: Service is also well delivered :)

Overall this is a yummy and cute place to visit."}
{"text":"Butter Avenue is a very small cafe. As I went inside there were about 7 tables where 5 were taken. This would be good if you had a date with one of your friends. Not a good idea having many people over as it created a loud atmosphere where I had 5 people with me. The ambiance of the room was elegant and gently dark. The shop wasn't quite busy as I went there at 5 pm on a Friday.

  I got the 6 pack of macrons for $13.50. The price on the macrons were decent because it didn't count for tax ($2.25 a piece). The size of the macrons were quite small which means I had to take very careful bites. I ate two when I was at the cafe. They had many array of flavors and each and every one of them looked so lovely. Some of the flavors were earl grey, green tea, chocolate, cream cheese passion fruit, raspberry, chocolate hazelnut, etc. The employee who got my macrons was very gentle and 'took good care of them' which meant good service. They didn't mind me taking a long time adoring the macrons and deciding which ones I should get. 

 I had the earl grey macron where the flavor was subtle. I also ate the salted caramel. It was OK but I thought the other flavors would've been better.  I gave the other macrons to my cousins and they said they were very good and enjoyed it a lot.  It was alright but I thought it could have been better. Overall, the macrons were delicious and I would go here next time."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place for a nice pick me up - and if my wallet isn't as flat as it usually is from the amount of money I spend on food. 
This place is very clean and fresh; everything is decked out in a simplistic white theme. I think this is to help the colorful and cute macarons stand out! 
Customer service was great - they offered great advice for which macarons were the most popular and always ask me what I'm in the mood for (sweet, fruity, mild, etc) They also really took care of me and my friend. I asked for a glass of water and they gave me a variety of options - extremely hospitable and friendly. Don't be afraid to ask them any questions or approach them. (:
My favorites are the Earl Grey, Salted Caramel, Passion Fruit, Caramel Macchiato .. Oh God, I'm already craving a box of these suckers. ):
Definitely give this place a try if you're ever in the area! I really want to try out their cakes but they're so expensive for me .. One day, Butter Avenue. One day.
If you're in a generous mood, always pick up a box for your parents, friends, boyfriend, or whatever; I know I always pick up a box for my dad. ($13.50 including tax for a box of 6)
Worth the small splurge of money for a little taste of heaven."}
{"text":"Macaron Day TO

I have evaluated macarons from the following establishments: Petit Thuet, Bobbette and Belle, Daniel et Daniel, Butter Avenue, Nadege, Moroco Chocolat, Ruelo Patisserie, and La Bamboche. Each location was graded on their atmosphere, service, selection, packaging, and of course, macarons. Please check out my profile for reviews of the other locations.

Butter Avenue
Location: 3467 Yonge St (Just south of Hwy 401. (Side street parking or Loblaws).
Atmosphere: Modern décor, minimalist and clean. White, grey, yellow palette, unfinished/industrial high ceilings give a lofty feel.

Service: The staff really do seem to love their macarons. They know each flavour well and were able to recommend macarons based on flavours you have liked in the past. All representatives served with a smile. Not sure if the big guy behind the cashier was owner or manager, but he was very friendly, easy to talk to and had a charming presence. 

Packaging: For 6 macarons, I was given an adorable box and paper gift bag which was perfect to protect the goods from being bumped around and damaged.

Selection: One of the biggest selections I've seen. I was incredibly happy to see the variations of flavours. I purchased a box of 6 and was not disappointed by any of the flavours. My favourite was Lavender though I am excited to try their Earl Grey one day.

Macaron: All of Butter Avenue's macarons were melt in your mouth with just the right amount of resistance in the shell. The ganache filling was made to perfection as was the 2:1 cookie to filling ratio. I enjoyed the light flavours as well as the natural/muted colours of the macarons. Out of all the locations, Butter Avenue is one of the top contenders.

Conclusion: I was very impressed with the experience I had at Butter Avenue and look forward to returning in the future! I will hold off a perfect score until I return to evaluate their dine-in experience.

I give Butter Avenue a solid A for exceeding macaron expectations.

My final thoughts: Out of all the macarons and locations I've tried (and ensuring to cleanse my palette with water after each bite), the top two contenders have to be Ruelo and Butter Avenue. Both establishments made macaroons their specialty and both execute them incredibly well. You honestly cannot go wrong with either of them. Nadege is a good alternative and if you're looking for a dine-in experience to try other nibblets. La Bamboche is nice on the go. Moroco Chocolate and Bobbette and Belle are also both worthy choices. I would avoid Daniel et Daniel or Petit Thuet though I heard good things about their other ventures and products (macarons are definitely not their forte)."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but if you want a good macaron, this is not the place to go. I really don't get the hype, when you can walk west to La Bamboche and get the real thing. Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I finally tried Butter (not magarine - ha! ok sorry lame).  The owners (bro & sis) are so sweet, very nice people!  I went on Macaron Day T.O. (March 20/2012).  Free macaron was Salted Caramel, so scrumptious.  I'd say it's my favourite flavour there!  You can taste the butter and love.  I also purchased a box of six, placed into a very sturdy and good-looking box.  

$13.50 for 6 macarons:
Seasalt Caramel
Matcha
Earl Grey
Peanut Butter & Jelly
Chocolate Banana
White Chocolate Strawberry

They are on the smaller side, about the size of a toonie.  Very fresh though, with the proper texture a macaron is famous for.  Flavour-wise, other than the luscious caramel and PB&J, I found them a little on the sweet side.  I had to really concentrate while chewing to guess what flavour I was eating.  Which was okay by me, because there are a lot other worse things to fixate on than chewing a macaron."}
{"text":"I love Butter Avenue. Whenever I crave for French macarons, Butter Avenue is my go to place to get some! I am obsessed with their earl grey and lavender flavored macarons! The filling is not overwhelming with a perfect chewy cookie texture! It's too bad that lavender is a seasonal flavor. In addition, I love their tarts, their pistachio tart is a must try and one of their top sellers! They provide excellent customer service, very friendly staff team. The down side is that there isn't really any parking in particular for Butter Avenue themselves therefore, I find myself parking at the grocery store that's next to them quite often. Just thinking about it is making me want some now!"}
{"text":"Just went there with friend today, and I tried terre et neige for the first timr and it's delicious, for the macaroons, I think pistachio is my favorite of them all! And the price is acceptable (12 macaroons for $28, terre et neige are $7-8)"}
{"text":"best macaroons in Toronto hands down. Enough said :)"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for a while now since everybody raves about their macarons. I walked in and was greeted instantly, the place is chic and modern , very minimalistic decor. The guy that helped me was very nice & described every kind of macaron they have as well as the tarts and mousses. I bought 15 macarons & a salted caramel latte. i forgot to take a picture of the pistachio, earl grey & dark chocolate but i will describe every one that i bought :) 

Pistachio : I surprisingly enjoyed this flavor. Its light & airy with a hint of pistachio flavoring . and that's saying a lot because i normally don't like pistachio macarons.

Earl Grey : Classic flavoring, nothing special

Dark Chocolate : The dark chocolate ganache in between was a little more bitter than i would've liked it to. But it pairs well with the meringue cookie since its so sweet.

Sea Salt Caramel x2: One of my favorite flavors of macarons. Theres a light hint of salt when you bite into the macaron. Caramel is not too sweet, its absolutely perfect.

Lychee Raspberry x2: Heavy on the lychee flavoring like every other bakery that makes macaron. Has a raspberry \"jam\" ontop of the lychee buttercream. Compliments each other very well

Cassis : Its also called blackcurrant. It's tart which is lovely because the one that i had at Ruelo in Times Square (Richmond Hill) was bitter. And i believe that it was because they put espresso in the jam or around it. i loved this flavor.

Oolong : I've never had Oolong Tea before, but i overall enjoyed the flavour. Its not too sweet but also not a very strong tea flavour

Lemon : LOVE the lemon curd. Very tart and delicious

Raspberry : I enjoyed the raspberry jam, not too sweet for a macaron which is nice.

Matcha : Usually my favorite flavor but not my favorite here. Matcha flavor is very light, not strong enough. Thats my only issue, other then that it's alright.

White Chocolate Strawberry : White Chocolate ganache is a tad too sweet, strawberry jam is ontop of the ganache. I like strawberry white chocolate so i loved it.

The Sea Salt Caramel Latte was not bad , pretty good. Sweet enough, not very strong of a caramel flavour or a salt flavour. I needed the coffee so i enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Butter Avenue is near Bobette & Belle. Both have very good reputation. I was trying to Bobbette & Belle first, but they were already closed at 6:30 pm. Then I went to Butter Avenue because they opened until late. They gave me nice wrapping for pastries I bought. The pastries were pricey but not bad. I would not say pastries were excellent but good looking and fine tasting. Their macarons are excellent like Bobette & Belle. I think Bobette & Bell macaron may be a little bit cheaper. Anyway both have excellent macarons."}
{"text":"Butter Avenue always went above and beyond in delivering new flavours and products. On top of that, wonderful services, the company's well trained staffs are well known in the city. As another business owner I understand how challenging it is to train every employee to represent the company's value and philosophy every second they serve the customers. Much respect for Butter Avenue on this.

My favourite is the earl grey macaron, if there is one thing I can have everyday in life this will be it. I'd like to recommend more edgy and contradicting / mixed flavours that surprises our tastebuds ... how about wasabi+custard / sesame+sriracha / watermelon+basil ?

Looking forward to see how the company will evolve in future. Quality brand comes with attention to details and determination lead the industry :)"}
{"text":"Tried it the first time on Valentine's Day got half a dozen macaron and a pistachio tart/cake. The presentation and the box was really nice, however the macaron texture was very stale. Some were chewy and one was crunchy (fall apart) it seems they they started making them few days ago in anticipation of Valentine's Day as it will be a busy day. The flavour was good but the texture of it seems like a day or two old. 
The tart/cake was good though!"}
{"text":"I went on a Friday night around 8pm and all they had out was a few macarons and nothing 2 danishes. I was really upset at the fact that there were not more tarts. All I got was a Sea Salt Caramel Macaron and an Americano. Macaron was a little chewy but the flavour was excellent. Americano was very watery and I couldn't taste much of the coffee itself. I would go back to get one of the tarts but hopefully they won't be all sold out."}
{"text":"I love this place so much! 

The macarons are delicious and the cakes even more so. My favorite being the matcha, its smooth and tastes just like it. 

I was so surprised by the price also! We got a 6 box of macarons, two cakes and two cups of English breakfast tea and it came to roughly $26! 

The staff are really friendly and helpful too.

Out of all the places that do my macarons, to this I will remain faithful!"}
{"text":"Beautifully prepared macarons and a nice variety of other confections and teas. I'm partial to ganache or jam filled macarons,  and all of the options here were buttercream (hence the 3 instead of 4 stars)."}
{"text":"It's hard to contain my sweet tooth when there's so many dessert places to try out in Toronto, and I just can't resist trying macarons approved by fellow Yelpers! 

Butter Avenue's macarons are smaller than others I've tried but priced below $3.00. I loved their chocolate hazelnut flavor, but their pistachio wasn't as pistachio-ey as I'd hoped. Salted caramel was delicious as well - macaron form of their salted caramel latte. It'll give you the warm and fuzzy feeling afterwards, seriously. 

The staff here are all-smiles and service is warm and personable. The interior is clean and polished, I wish my room was this clean. 

Next time I'll be trying out their mini cake assortments. I'm sure they'll be as good as they look, or maybe I'll just put it in a glass case and admire it.."}
{"text":"There should be a new and kinder definition of \"butter-face\" meaning: person stuffing their face with delicious Butter Avenue macarons.

At $2.25 a pop, they aren't the cheapest way to get a dessert fix but worth it.
I didn't want just one macaron...so, I bought myself 6 of them for $13.50.

The owners are brother and sister and they did a great job of making you feel welcome.  Unlike some other patisseries...

There were standard flavours and some fun tea ones as well such as matcha and Earl Grey.  I tried the dark chocolate, passion fruit, but the salted caramel was my favourite!

Each macaron was absolutely perfect.  
Crispy and delicate on the outside but still moist and chewy.
The filling was smooth and you could really taste the different flavours.

Next time I'm in the area, I'll swing by... maybe after grabbing grub at Burger Priest down the street."}
{"text":"Went to Butter today to try out their macarons. Why would anybody go there otherwise right?

I've read everybody's reviews for this place and was very eager to try it out for myself. I'd have to say, I'm more than just pleasantly surprised if not blown away with my experience. Although I'm a macaron noob, I have tried macarons and Reulo's and La Bambouche. In comparison I'd have to say Butter's macarons were the best. 

The ones at Ruelo cannot hold its shape and deflate/crumble completely after the first bite. Although I have the admit, the flavours were okay. The ones at La Bambouche were smaller, the shell was not crispy enough, and the filling was very sweet. With everybody's positive reviews there, maybe mine was just a bad luck fluke. 

The ones at Butter however, were slightly bigger, slightly cheaper (I'm sure everybody would want a deal in this economy), and majorly on-point with its texture and flavour. With my first bite into the crisp shell, hearing the crack, and seeing the shell slightly break away, I think I almost had a food orgasm. I could taste all the flavours it says it contains, with some having real fruit pieces as filling (pistachio cherry). 

As a side note, their cappuccino was amazing. Awesome microfoam, perfect temperature, and great taste. The cute little latte art was the cherry on top though. No matter how hard I try, my microfoam was never as good as his, and my art looks like swiggly lines of nothing. All-in-all, I think this place will be my new coffee joint now. Love it!"}
{"text":"This is best macaroon place in GTA area.

My favorite spot to grab coffee and macaroons. 

White chocolate Strawberry one is my favorate and they're always fresh and well made.

And their espresso coffee is best and high quality, too.

Very attentive staff."}
{"text":"One of the few places that I've tried where the macarons are comparable to the ones I've had in Europe.  Delicious."}
{"text":"Honestly? No. 

As someone who LOVES macarons and makes it her life's mission to taste the best, these are not real macarons. 

Anyone who thinks they are, will be in for a real surprise and a treat when they taste the REAL thing.

I could eat them if I was forced to hit my sweet spot, just the raspberry or cassis ones, but the lemon one was just gross, like eating sugary lemon dish soap.

1. They are cold for a reason -- because they use a buttercream instead of a ganache for most of their macarons except for the lemon, raspberry and cassis ones, which to me, is not a real macaron and an utter cop out.

That also means they have to sit at ROOM temperature to taste good, but once it's at room temperature, the buttercream goes bad. Yuck.

2. They are filled with buttercream. Y'all know how I feel about buttercream (ick) in my macarons.

3. They have NOTHING on Pierre Herme in Paris, still THE BEST macaron-maker in all of the world (and I've eaten them from Hong Kong to Canada to NYC to Paris). Laduree is 2nd best but only in the NYC location, not the Paris one (tourist trap).

4. They are too chewy and dense, they should be more cakey and moist.

The search continues. At least it doesn't suck as bad as Moroco or Nadege."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! The french macarons are spot on. Not too sweet, not bland, cruchy on the outside, chewy on the inside, with yummy fillings! My most favorite is sea salt caramel! But they are all my favorite, really! The pumpkin spice is a must mention, which they only offer seasonally. This is the place to satisfy those french macaron cravings! We also ordered a latte and a tea, which we also LOVED! The people behind the counter were super nice as well. Highly recommend Butter Avenue!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for about 1 year. Their macarons and coffee are really good. Service has always been amazing and they make amazing recommendations. Some of their desserts are pretty good and their cakes made to order are at a reasonable price. Personally, I love the salted caramel macaron and their salted caramel latte. 
*Only negative thing is there's not enough seating."}
{"text":"SUGAR RUSH! Is what I'm experiencing right now. As the weather is 4 degress warmer than the usual -30 weather we've been having... I told Dave to meet me at Lawrence subway after work as we are going on a mission... Not far I assured him... Don't worry about the address I know where it is I insisted... How much further? he yelled as he sped walked ahead... It was cold...

As we walked into Butter Avenue, our moods completely  changed... I knew exactly what I wanted... The  st. Honore pistachio, and three macaroons: cassisi, matcha and chestnut, strawberry cream cheese. Cassisi was the best... It tasted like jam! The honore pistachio was amazing... As well as the raspberry macaroons on top. The entire time I kept going yummm and \"Dave!!! This is so good!!\".  It was worth talking about... I couldn't even pay attention when trying to be \"present\" and asked Dave about his day... I don't even know what he said cause in my head all I was hearing was \"omg this is so delicious!! Can I take one to go pleaseeee?\" 

It gets 4 stars because the price. We also got a salted caramel latte and chair latte and it all came to $27. The two drinks weren't anything special... And its too bad cause the desserts was just phenomenal. 

Will be back to try the other cakes. In the summer, it'll be a nice excuse to go for a \"walk\" =D"}
{"text":"On my first visit I shared 6 macarons with my two friends (we each had a nibble) and every single one we had was absolutely amazing. All of them were perfect. 

The earl grey and green tea macarons were my favourite. After finishing the 6 macarons I then purchased a mini mango tart that had two mini macarons on it. It was heavenly. The lady who was working behind the counter made great suggestions and I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Love their macaroons :) nothing bad to say about them! Great service and many choices, it is more on the expensive side though but expected!

Their wifi password is \"thebestmacaron\""}
{"text":"Came here for dessert 

Pros 
Polite employees 
Quick service 

Cons
Expensive for what you get 
Macaroons tasted very synthetic, would not recommend"}
{"text":"Their versions of macarons are pretty small. My sister comes here often and gets me a few flavours here and there although none really stand out for me as I prefer Bamboche or others. Would maybe stop by here again but only if I was in the neighbourhood. Other than that I'd rather take a trip another subway station down to get the bigger ones at Bamboche."}
{"text":"I like their cakes better than their macarons. I like the macarons with the jelly filling. But the Macarons are too sweet for me for most part. 
The iced coffees are nice. 

Packaging is cute too."}
{"text":"I was here expecting to try some amazing macarons.  My expectations were quite high as I have heard several friends highly recommend this place.  When I walked, I was greeted by a enormous macaron tree.  Nicely done!  At first, i was just planning to buy some macarons.  I forgot the names of the different flavours already.  But i think i really like the asian tea inspired macarons, green tea, earl grey and some other teas. The macarons tasted really mild and cake like and soft in texture.  The proportion of the filling is just right.  The lemon poppyseed macaron is really good.  The flavour is cirtusy, fresh and bright.  Just feel like a perfect compliment to summer.  I should have taken a pictures with the different names.  Anyways, i feel like i am rambling.  Their decor is really chic and simple.  I really like the soft white tone of the backdrop.  There were some soft jazz music playing in the background and the seats were really spread out.  

At first, i was planning to just buy some macarons and leave.  But i saw the coffee looked pretty good, so i ordered a latte and a cappuccino for my mom.  I waited for a bit, maybe around 15 minutes.  Still no sign of coffee.  I saw that the guests who came in later than me were already served their high tea platter and beverages.  I went up to the cashier and casually asked why my coffees haven't been served yet.  The guy was really friendly and politely explained that he forgot about it and stated he would refund my money and served me the coffee.  Actually, I just wanted my coffee to be served and was not asking for a refund.  I was presently surprise at this good gesture.  This is excellent customer service and totally didn't expect this at a bakery at all.  I would defintely come back more of their delicious macarons."}
{"text":"My gf is a big fan of this place and you know what they say \"happy wife happy life\" haha.  They are one of the premier macaron cafes in Toronto and there is always a line up or items sold out during special occasions.  

I often come here to load up on treats for those special occasions throughout the year like birthdays, anniversaries and valentines day.  Not to mention days where you did something wrong! :P Shhhh!

The choices are vast and my gfs personal favorites consist of sea salt caramel, pistachio and earl grey to name a few.  The special seasonal flavours also add a nice mix into their staple menu.  Be sure to come early to get the fresh batches that roll out of the kitchen. 

I'll definitely keep coming back so long as my girl continues to crave these little pricey treats.  Be sure to make your orders in advance for Valentine's day.  I know I will!  Although on the pricey side, these are probably some of the best macarons in Toronto by far!"}
{"text":"I love the seasonal macaroons! Their magi cake,  honey-like macaron and emperor tea are to die for! I absolutely love it :)"}
{"text":"The desserts are so elegant and absolutely delicious. They catch your eye like a piece of art. Prices are a bit high, as are most patisseries like these. It's very clean and has a miminalistic ambiance. Seating is limited, so we took our items to go. Ordered 6 macaroons, 1 canele, and a terre et neige (Semi sweet brownie, green tea mousse made with matcha). This is definitely the place to go if you are looking for special and high quality desserts, but be prepared to spend a lot too!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love miniature decadent desserts. High tea here will fill you with yumminess down to your toes, you would think you were away in Europe!

The high tea is lovely. The place is lovely. Decor is very minimalistic and they have big windows where the sunlight can come in. Brightly lit. We ordered the high tea ahead of time online. We informed them when we got there and they got us seated by the window. 

They have a good selection of high quality tea. Comes in a a cute little glass teapot. However, I thought the tea service was a bit slow, it took them a while to boil the water and each time was only enough for one cup. First they brought us our savory quiche which I thought was fine, but I'm not a fan of Quiches. The other savory item were brioche buns that we could eat with homemade raspberry jam. The jam was nice and fruity but I would have liked more savory items like butter etc. 

The mini pastries came in a two tier serving stand. They were so beautiful! A feast for the eyes that will leave your palate dancing! They have a selection of cakes and tarts and cheesecakes and mousse. Sorry I forgot what they all were! You also have your choice of two of their famous macarons. I picked the lemon poppyseed and passionfruit black tea. I didn't think the flavour was intense enough but I'm not really a fan of macarons, so what do I know? It also comes with delicious decadent chocolates and shortbread. 

Overall, I loved the whole experience. The tarts and cakes were so good, I will definitely come back. The tea was good (but slow). The ambience was classy and calm. The service was superb. The location was okay, may have an issue with parking... Sorry for the late post, but I'm totally craving it right now and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My go-to for macarons! I love how I can get pretty and delicious macarons in North York without having to venture down downtown. Their macarons are consistent in how they look and taste.

Butter Avenue has interesting subtle flavours that make me go back all the time. The flavours sound so unique that they are hard to resist. 

Their cakes and tartes are great as well, and yep, lots of butter inside them as well. They're on the pricier side for $7.50 each, but they're worth it - the tartes come with two macarons each!"}
{"text":"Great little dessert shop. Their desserts and drinks here are fairly priced, and tasty. They have a seating area under the shop, and the interior is very well decorated and designed. Will recommend"}
{"text":"Had the lumiere set today.  Short blonde hair waitress I had was awesomely nice.  It came with a quiche and a brioche - I did not like it at all.  Quiche was very starchy and overly salty.  I had a hard time swallowing the dried brioche.  I'm not a fan of their macarons there - but some people loves it.  Dessert plate is a must have!!  I thoroughly enjoyed *everything* on the plate and with a cup of americano!"}
{"text":"Dropped by today for some tarts and macaroons! Got mango and pistachio tarts, which were $7.50/ea and a box of 6 macaroons. The tarts themselves came with 2 macaroons on it, which was great value! Just when you decide to go on Saturday afternoon (which I did), expect that there's a good chance that no empty seats are left."}
{"text":"I'd gone to this place a few years ago for a Yelp event and wasn't totally blown away by their macarons.  Decided not to write an unflattering review since they seemed to try so hard.

Glad I went back and give it another try.  Macarons are nicely done so are the coffee drinks.  Some flavours are a bit on the sweet side but it's a personal preference thing.  You can't help but wondering the influence of  Ladurée when you see their macaron boxes....so pretty.

Repeat visits are in the future."}
{"text":"Had a great time at Butter Avenue today for a meeting. Ordered a slice of st honore pistachio cake - I usually don't like getting the last of things...but for places like Butter Avenue, it's goes quick because it's good. Also had the almand brulee and finally, after a million years of hoping someone would make it - red bean matcha macaron. I like that it's priced at $2.35 more so than other places that cost $3 something (it's bigger but I'd rather try more flavours). Ambience and environment at Butter Avenue is always great- perfect for a Sunday meeting or laid back solo chilling. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My favourite macaroon place in the city - trust me, I've tried a lot of them and I just keep coming back! The texture is ah-mazing and flavours are usually on point! I don't think I have come across anything I didn't like including flavours that I normally wouldn't go for. I love that their always introduce new and seasonal flavours :) I also like their cakes as well - so delicate and unique! This is my go to place when I want to get a special dessert treat for myself or someone else. I also like that they do open late (great for last minute gifts since they have the cutest packaging - which I have done a few times!)"}
{"text":"I'm new to the world of macarons but these little cookies are amazing. I've tried a few before that were quite stale however the macaroons at butter avenue are always fresh and leave you wanting more! 

Butter has a fresh and great selection. My favourite flavours that are worth a try are the raspberry, sea salt caramel, oh hell...ya gotta try them all! Worth a taste is also there St.Honore pistachio tart which carries a mini macaron on top surrounded by Creme chantilly pistachio and pâté sucree."}
{"text":"While I am totally for abolishing the monarchy and any attachment to the throne, the one English tradition that I quite enjoy is the ritual of afternoon tea.  I'm just glad that we don't have to don any large hats or get sewed into a corset anymore - there are some traditions I'm glad have been put to rest.

One of my favorite patisseries North of the city is Butter Avenue, co-owned by siblings Calvin and Tina Su.  Calvin left the corporate world and puts his business know-how to use as sister Tina, who trained at Ottawa's Le Cordon Bleu, whips up beautiful and decadent creations in the back.

The patisserie first made its mark in Toronto with the French macaron but has since expanded its product offerings to include a variety of baked goods and confectioneries.

But what most people don't know is that they also offer afternoon tea; a lighter option, the Lumière($29.50 per person) or the De Luxe ($45 per person).  Reservations must be made a day in advance by 3PM.

The meal starts with brioche, mini quiches and smoked salmon croissant.  The smoked salmon croissant is the clear winner, flaky and buttery with the mini bacon and cheddar quiche as a close second.  The brioche needs a bit of work as it is rather bland.  However, I much prefer brioche, croissants and anything made from butter to boring, crustless tea sandwiches.

The savory selection is then followed by a butterflies-in-your-stomach excitement of petit fours which is placed in a natural progression of lightest to heaviest (much like a flight of beers/wine). We start with a light an airy pistachio profiterole topped with a white chocolate glaze; strawberry tartlet with candy cane; Terre et Neige (layers of matcha mousse, dark chocolate sponge + vanilla mousse); raspberry + dark chocolate mousse cake; mango jelly with coconut mousse on a pistachio tart base; and end with the nutty dark chocolate cake made with a duo of dark chocolate mousse atop a layer of chocolate sponge + puffed rice.  The selection of mousses seem a tad repetitive at first, but leave you feeling much lighter than the traditional ganache/butter-cream filled petits fours.  Tina does a good job at fusing French pastries with an Asian touch (as most Asian patisseries favor mousse to buttercream or icing).

The afternoon finishes with Butter Avenue's famed macarons and the pièce de resistance -the vanilla mousse + dark chocolate biscuit cake (which texturally is more akin to a panna cotta) to which a strong but silky espresso is poured.

For those of you who haven't had the chance to experience the wonderful macarons and pastries at Butter Avenue; I highly urge you to go.  The space is very inviting and on the plus side you can score free parking which will leave you with some extra change to splurge on more macarons!

**TIP: Check in on Yelp for a free Americano with any purchase.**

*NB* The vanilla mousse + dark chocolate biscuit cake is only available with the De Luxe set; which also includes 3 macarons versus 1 with the Lumière.  The drink options also expand to include lattés for those who don't fancy tea with the De Luxe set."}
{"text":"Went here literally just to check it out and write a review because people have been telling me to try their pastries since I'm one of those sweet lovers. First impression when I walked in was ... it was simple and clean. As I gravitated towards the sweets lined up nicely in their display fridge, they had a small but good-night selection of macaroons and some very pretty frech style desserts. I  ordered the Cassis mouse dessert which had a lemon poppy macaroon and a salted caramel macaroon and a few berries on top. Ordered 1 earl grey and a latte as well. I asked for Lactose Milk but the guy that served didn't understand what lactose milk was. I'm slightly lactose intolerant so I really can't drink milk with my tea. Anyway it wasn't a huge issue. We proceeded to check out which was relatively quick as it was a bit quiet in there. Overall the presentation was good, service is quick and desserts were well presented and tasty."}
{"text":"My addiction! My friend and I went on a \"Macaron Hunt\" all over Toronto. We tried almost every single macaron serving establishment. We both agreed that Butter Avenue was definitely our favourite!

I usually buy a whole bunch and store them in my freezer so I can have a treat here and there without actually having to travel all the way to their store. I love how chewy they are! My favourite flavours are Earl Grey, Matcha and Seal Salt Caramel. I could literally eat these all day if they weren't so expensive! I lived in Ottawa for a while and always made my boyfriend bring me macarons every time he came to visit me - yes I know, I'm addicted. 

Try this place at your own risk... Once you have had a bite, you'll instantly become an addict."}
{"text":"I had two of their macarons (lychee/raspberry and strawberry/white chocolate) along with the dark chocolate mousse cake. They were delightful. Just wish they weren't so expensive since even the cakes are mini-sized for about $9-10 after taxes each, which makes it similar in price to other French bakeries. Would go there a lot more often if they were cheaper since both the macaron and cakes were delicious."}
{"text":"These macarons were so good! They had a great selection and I especially loved the pistachio and the lavender! The place is neat and has a very modern ambiance to it.  The people working were so nice and were eager to assist me on which macarons were especially tasty.  This place was a great find and I would recommend anyone to come!"}
{"text":"Not exactly a \"macaron\" expert but I have had a few over the last year i.e Nadege, LaBamboche, Bobette and Belle.

Space: Love the clean fresh decor. 
Food: Sampled a few macarons and can't complain. However I really really loved their roasted almond tea. Absolutely delicious.
Service: Lovely.

Would definitely meet a friend for tea and a macaron at Butter Avenue!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best macarons in town.  We ordered our macaron towers for our wedding here.  There is a huge variety to choose from.  The earl grey and cream cheese passionfruit (seasonal) are my favorites."}
{"text":"I went o this place to grab a few desserts for takeout. It is a very nice little boutique cafe and cake store. i can imagine people coming in just for an afternoon tea and deserts. 
     The items i got was 6 different flavours of macaroons, and a cake called jaden garden. The macaroons flavours were all hybrids, include early grey tea flavour, green tea, pinapple, etc. i would say the pinapple and earl grey tea really stood out as very good macaroons. 
      Now for the Cake, it is a very moist and interesting flavour combination, i think it is very experimental, and i aplaud them for trying new things. Also the presentation value is very good, as this cake actually looked like a garden plant with soil. 

   The price for this place is the same as a typical high tea style price, macroons at a little over $2 a piece, and a cakes at about $6 before tax. if you are in the area, then i think it is worth a try to take out. definitely great for giving to others as gifts, as the box design and the cakes are very elegant and presentable"}
{"text":"i ordered 8 pieces of cakes for my cousin's birthday. they were disgusting. i have never had such bad experience.. the textures are horrible, as well as thr taste. unbelievable! i highly suspect all the positive reviews were fabricated.. i am not spamming here. try it yourself and you will know."}
{"text":"Good pastry but limited selection.  Good for a pick up and go or just after meal coffee + dessert stop."}
{"text":"I do not understand the high ratings for this place. I've tried many macaron shops and this falls under one of the worst ones i've ever had. When I bought it, they said it can be kept for up to 2 days in the fridge and still taste good. Okay as soon as I got it, I ate a couple of course, the shell was soft and chewy and the filling was too much on the salted caramel (too sweet). not a good feeling. SO i left it overnight in the fridge, let it cool down a bit and ate one in the morning. it got all soft and grainy gross. Not good! at all, At this point I would rave about how amazing this other shop is, a bit south from butter avenue, But I shell not mentioned the name, since I'm not here to advertise or take customers away from Butter Avenue (Just look at my other reviews) Never ever again I would return for another macaron. I agree that the six pack package is very cute, however packing is not the main point, it needs to taste good!"}
{"text":"I was really craving for macarons so I decided to get some with my bf, we drove up yonge but missed it, we found it in out GSP though. Buy if this is your first time going to butter avene then just look for the loblaws, it's 4-5 stores south of the loblaws.  Butter avene has a very nice store front do if your walking you wouldn't miss it! If your driving there, it's hard to park on the street since it is yonge so just pull in the loblaws parking lot, it isn't a long way at all!! 

I got there with only about 15 mins left before closing so there isn't much Macrons left. Since I was craving for them I decided to get my friend some since I was seeing her later that night I got a box of 6 for her and 40 for myself, crazy I know. My total for 46 was $50 something, I do enjoy the packaging for the 6 pack of Macrons better than the pack of 40, it was super cute!! 

My favorite flavor was early grey, I am in love with it. Lemon and cassis is very good as well!! When I return here these are the 3 flavors I'm picking up! They say you can leave then in the fridge for up to 2 days and yes but it was get colder and the shell gets harder as well. But I don't have a huge problem with that, a different spin I guess. Lady behind was counter was very nice!! 

I do feel that it's very far, I wish they would expand and open one near the downtown toronto core. Easier to get too and for people that don't drive or travel far they can try out these macarons too!  Needless to say I do plan in going back to get more sweet treats! But my bf thinks I'm crazy for spending almost 60$ on sweets!  Haha"}
{"text":"Was craving something sweet so my pal and I came here to try Butter Avenue's famous macaron. For $2.25 a pop, I can't have one everyday, but it's a nice treat. I bought two - Early Grey and Lychee Raspberry. Both were pretty good ! The decor of this place is really nice - all white, sleek, and clean. I was in a hurry so didn't get a chance to sit in, but will love to get a couple of macarons with a tea while doing some work on my laptop sounds like another visit to come.

Good for: sweets, coffee, tea"}
{"text":"Came here three times, Butter Avenue is a delicious macaron shop located on Yonge Street. Its easy to recognize with the canary yellow colour and I believe a pug as their logo animal? 

I adore their variety and design of the wide selection of macarons. During valentines day, Butter Avenue makes cute heart shaped macarons. Candy cane macarons are made near to Christmas time. 

Their macarons taste pretty good, the shell is soft and cracks gently. The filling is complimentary to the shell."}
{"text":"Came here to get macarons for gifts and really liked their choices for unique flavours. Butter Avenue has become my go-to place to get desserts/gifts for people. Their packaging is a bit clumpsy, I prefer their classic boxes. Good place to get sweets for someone special or just for yourself! They also offer hot drinks and plenty of seating if you want to stay for a bit."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out after seeing the blogTO reivew, http://www.blogto.com/bakery/butter-avenue-toronto.

I had missed the shop twice going back and forth, as it's right on the corner of Yonge and where Loblaws ends. Just a tip that you didn't hear it from me, Loblaws is super close and has free parking, meaning after you 'shop' at Loblaws you can walk on over to Butter.

Macarons were surprisingly very good, I'm no Macaron expert but I like ones that are not super sweet and keep it's structure even after a few bites. Tried the matcha, raspberry, lemon, passionfruit and strawberry, all excellent. The Mrs. liked them too and she's a Macaron super fan, heck she even has a Macaron charm from Ladurée. 

Will definitely be back, it's also a nice place to relax with the large windows with natural light, high ceilings and lots of seats.

I'll up to 5 stars after trying the new stuff coming like croissant and sandwhiches.

PS. the boxes are so cool I want to keep em to store things."}
{"text":"Came here specifically to participate in Macaron Day. Butter Avenue is located just south of the Loblaws on Yonge Street, north of Lawrence. The place has a clean minimalist vibe and I got the sense from the macarons on offer that the flavours are Asian inspired. 

When hubby and I walked in we were greeted by staff and given a paper menu from which to choose your flavours. We decided on some Asian inspired flavours like toasted green tea, green apple matcha, Iron Goddess (premium oolong; could definitely taste the oolong), plus slightly more traditional flavours like toffee hazelnut. The macarons have that crunch and desirable chewiness that I look for in a macaron. The buttercream fillings were in the right proportion to the size of the macaron. Finally the flavours were on point and they were not too sweet. My only complaint is that they did not have more traditional flavours like salted caramel or pistachio available as these are my go to flavours against which I benchmark macaron purveyors. I was also hoping to try the earl grey flavour as others have remarked it is quite memorable.

As it is a bit of a trek for me to get to Butter Avenue, I probably won't be regularly frequenting this place. But I was happy to finally try this place as all the positive Yelp reviews encouraged. For me, 12 macarons for $29.50 is a bit steep (but probably on par with most reputable shops that sell macarons). At least on Macaron Day I can feel better about the fact that 30% of the proceeds are going to charity.

(17/100)"}
{"text":"The inside was beautiful! Very modern and clean.
 
We got a dozen macarons for $28. 

A lot of them had heavy perfume, especially secret garden. Much too overwhelming for me. 
Very well made and high quality macarons!"}
{"text":"Very clean and pretty store, with beautifully presented macarons.

Tons of different and interesting flavours to choose from. I settled on trying a sea salt caramel and dark chocolate macaron. Both were totally delicious! 

They also do fancy little cakes as well if you wanted to pick one up for a special occasion. 

The staff were very friendly when I was there - I would return for a special treat!"}
{"text":"This is my go to macaroon place! They have a lot of variety and satisfies my cravings. Although it is kinda far to me, I would go here every time I am in the area! Try their little cakes they have on the side. The one I tried was the matcha one and it was simply amazing! Not too sweet which is a plus for matcha flavoured items for me."}
{"text":"Clean white interior, sparse decor, has tables & seating.

Macarons are the name of the game here, they are pricey but they are best in Toronto. Great selection of flavours & possess  an eggshell-like crust with a soft almost meringue-like interior...the way a textbook macaron should be.

The espressos & Americanos are very good here & go well with the sweets they have available.

Loblaws parking is nearby, but beware the parking attendant, make sure to evacuate from your vehicle when he is distracted &/or not in line of sight."}
{"text":"3.5/5

This place is cute modern minimalist macaron cafe. They carry diff. flav. of macarons and few selection of mini macaron desserts like tarts and cakes. I tried many macarons before and also love making it, and these guys do have few nice macarons but i find out its bit too sweet and lack of flav. for my taste. Their matcha and cassis are quite nice. Earl grey and raspberry aren't bad either but I think they can make it more flavourful. Other than these,  everything else are just like other yelper said sugary chewy soap. Okay maybe not soap. To be fair they weren't THAT bad. Well maybe not orange or lemon ones. Those were horrible compare to other ones. Maybe I went there on wrong day. So I will return one or two more times to see if it was just a bad day thing.

Oh! try matcha cake if you like little bitter sweet green tea dessert. It is quite nice."}
{"text":"Northern/uptown Torontonians are in for a treat coming here. Some of us downtowners and Scarborough peeps are jealous.

There's a friendly aura from the staff here amongst the austere decor. Aside the coffee, you'll likely to notice the macarons, something Butter Avenue is prominently known for. And damn are they good ones.

I particularly enjoyed the Raspberry and Lychee, which had a lychee flavoured jelly filling deep inside. And also the Earl Grey, which does taste delicately like the tea. The Dark Chocolate though was oversweet. Pick 6 and it'll come in a box. Everyone likes their macarons in a well-presented box, no? At least that's what I keep seeing of posted pictures of Butter Avenue products online.

The only major problem is getting here.

{TTC: try the 97 bus. The 97A from York Mills station will plop you right at Yonge St and Yonge Blvd (don't ask me about that one). Besides street parking, there's a Loblaws a couple lots up if you want to push your lazy luck with parking.}"}
{"text":"Butter Avenue seems to specialize in macarons, tarts topped with macarons, and they offer coffee and tea drinks. At least, that's what I saw when I stopped by. I heard about the macarons here and made the effort to visit while in Toronto. I opted for six macarons and the gal helping me was more than patient when I asked her questions and picked my flavors. I had the:

1) Spring My Love (Saffron Raspberry)
2) Earl Grey
3) Passionfruit Cream Cheese
4) Lychee Raspberry
5) Pistachio Cherry
6) Caramel Macchiato

My favorites were the Passionfruit Cream Cheese and Caramel Macchiato, with my least favorite being the Spring My Love. I didn't taste any saffron unfortunately. Overall, I really enjoyed the flavors and particularly, the texture of each macaron. These were some of the best I've had!"}
{"text":"Alas, I have finally made it to Butter!!!! A clean white space with minimal decor, Butter stays true to its core competency - macarons and desserts accompanied with these little treats.
Service is friendly and courteous and most importantly.. Patient!
S and I ordered a macaron and a green tea chocolate mousse bomb to share. We received the cutest little fork and knives to eat this delicate concoction... So we could take our time instead of gobbling it up in 3 bites.
The green tea chocolate was not too sweet and you could really taste the cocoa flavour. the macaron had a lot of flavour in the filling and the crust was soft and fresh.

I just found out that they are opening Butter downtown! How awesome is that???"}
{"text":"Beautiful Macarons.

To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of sweets. But this place I would put as one of the top places to get something sweet for someone. 

It's not somewhere I would bring someone, but their macarons are nice to show off, especially in their little yellow box with all the colourful macarons lined up nicely.

I guess it's not my favourite as I'm not a fan of sweets, but my parents who do like sweet things really enjoyed the macarons and thought they were cute!

I would recommend this place to get macarons for a special friend, or in case you want someone to not be mad at you anymore ;)."}
{"text":"After a long wait, butter avenue has finally opened!  Now I can tell you that I probably wouldn't have known about this place if it hadn't been for the hotel ocho event last year. 

Ever since that first bite of their macarons, I was hooked. I immediately started stalking them on Facebook waiting them to open. Finally the day came and I rushed to go see them. 

Now you may wonder why I'm making such a big deal about this place, but I assure you that one bite will explain everything. Their macarons are light, soft chewy and fall apart in your mouth. I've had bad ones too that are kinda like Oreo cookies (bah). 

They have an assortment of flavours (I think 11) such as sea salt caramel, green tea matcha, chocolate and more. I just bought 4 boxes and haven't tried every one but I can tell you which ones are my favorite. 

My favorite ones are the sea salt caramel and matcha.  The sea salt caramel is just amazing. Probably the best balance of flavours and the chewy light texture of the macarons just add to the amazing experience. The matcha tea ones apparently have matcha tea from Japan which is amazing. You can instantly taste the matcha tea flavour and it's awesome. 

They also serve coffee, tea, sandwiches and other pastries that apparently go fast. This place opened not too long ago so the word is going to start spreading pretty fast.  Come early and soon to avoid the wildfire that is starting. Mums the word ;-)"}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of macarons, pastries, and guzzled quite a few espressos in my day.
And I give Butter the thumbs up.
Friendly staff, immaculate setting.
Macarons are perfect.  Among the best I've had.
I only got to try one cake, the hazelnut chocolate one.  It was pretty good, though the crispy layer was a smidge soggy.  This is the only downfall of the place.
I loved the French music playing in the background too!
Americano was great!
This place is the next big patisserie in Toronto, for sure."}
{"text":"Got off of work and remember Butter Avenue was right up the road ehehehe :3

I came in around 5:30ish, the place pretty deserted minus two customers and the 2 owners? They still have a huge selection of macarons minus chocolate hazelnut flavor which had sold out by then, there was only 2 matcha left, every other flavour was like 8+ anyways, $2.25 per macaron, $13.65 for a box of 6. They also have mini macarons which are now $7.75 instead  of $7.25. Moving on, I got an Earl Grey, Matcha and Sea Salt Caramel.

Sea Salt Caramel: Very sweet! I think I got a mediocre batch of this flavor, shell was hard and really chewy but it was still fairly good. I think I'll avoid this flavor next time since I'm not a sweet (like super sweet) eater.

Matcha: Strong green tea powder taste, duh! Yay! Rather light yet fluffy and crunchy shell with a soft chewy center. I felt the filling for this one was lacking like there wasn't enough but that was fine with me.

Earl Grey: Strong earl grey tea taste, yay! Honestly, I have to taste some tea in the tea flavor macarons or else, it would not be classified as a tea flavor. Super picky, aren't I? This one was really, really, really good. Nice soft and fluffy with a slight crunch :) 

I'll definitely come back to try the other flavours."}
{"text":"Looooove the macarons.  I decided to visit the store based on the reviews that I have read on yelp.  I'm very satisfied!  I did notice a lot of macarons but I did not see a lot of pastries on the counter (this was around 4:45pm even though the store closes at 7pm on Sundays).  I'm just wondering if people were still baking at the back and everything must have gotten sold out in the front :P  I would have loved to order some other stuff:) Nevertheless, customer service was friendly and I really enjoyed making the trek down to the place.  The only thing that sucks is it's in the middle of nowhere - between Lawrence and York Mills station.  I don't drive but since it was a nice day, the walk was worth it."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite places for cakes and macaroons. The lemon poppyseed one was amazing. It wasn't too sweet or too sour, just the perfect balance."}
{"text":"The macrons here are beyond delicious. The store is very nice and the staff are so friendly. The desserts are decadent in a good way. The only knock is the store is a bit out of the way and the price is relatively high. I would come again. You can get 6 macrons for about $14 plus tax."}
{"text":"I got 6 macarons this time (starting with my faves) - Matcha, Salted Caramel, Earl Grey, Pumpkin Spice x 2 (limited time offer), and White Chocolate Strawberry.  

The macarons here are amazing!  Some people think macarons can be too dry, to brittle, too chewy ... but these are just right.  The filling is soft, and I feel like I'm tasting real, fresh ingredients, and it's not overloaded with sugar.

Presentation wise ... it's simple, modern - chic.  The display was clean and white and their impressive packaging warms the neutrals up by adding a dash of mustard yellow, with the logo of a dog, which I found out were the owners' pet dog!

Service wise ...  Calvin & Tina are super friendly - definitely one of the nicest store owners I have ever met.

Price wise ... it's standard pricing for macarons which are known to be on the pricey side.  if you get 6+, you save the taxes. Also, if you like them on Facebook, you'll get a complimentary Americano."}
{"text":"Macarons - I find the texture of the macarons here to be inconsistent, usually a hit or miss. When it's good: I will get a soft, moist center with a light crunch from the shell. When it's bad: thick, hard, hollow shell with a chewy center. Flavour-wise, I really like earl grey, hazelnut, and salted caramel.

Atmosphere and employees are decent. Cute packaging."}
{"text":"Don't do it... IT'S A TRAP. I fell in love with their sweet bite sized burgers & my life hadn't been the same ever since. 

Their passion fruit macaron is...  gluttonously good. Whenever I'm having a bad/stressful day, I tend to turn to Butter Avenue. Granted, this is not a healthy obsession for a number of reasons (to which I'm aware). Their cafe/patisserie has an upper-class upscale feel to it (although I've never personally dined in before). 

Without a doubt, this is an amazing gift for a foodie friend. It's a cute surprise/\"I'm sorry, I messed up\" gift for a girlfriend, sister, mother... It would be a waste on a guy who doesn't appreciate desserts (I'm sorry but at $3 a pop, you're better off buying a sub/sandwich). Last time as I left Butter Avenue with my to-go box of macarons, I passed a couple on their way in. For a brief moment, I heard the guy slightly sigh \"this is highway robbery.\" Ha, can't argue with you bud. But I'm hooked. :( 

Do I recommend Butter Avenue? Absolutely! The beauty of living in Toronto is that you have a variety of petite macaron shops within your nearby vicinity. It's a sweet life."}
{"text":"Love this place only gave 4 stars because I feel the cookies are just a bit overpriced but if your willing to splurge you won't be disappointed.  The flavours are wonderful. The perfect  desert not to sweet , perfect light crunch and creamy inside.  I will come back again and again when in T.O."}
{"text":"I tried their danishes and they were just ok, nothing special to them. The macaroons are cold. I don't know if this is how it is supposed to be since I have never had cold macaroons anywhere else but the flavours are quite interesting. If not for the coldness and sparse filling, I would rate the macaroons much higher which would have raised my total rating for the place.

On a much brighter note, the guy there gives great service and is very friendly so it is still a good place to visit for post dinner dessert if you are in the area."}
{"text":"$13.50 for 6 macrons
Comes in a nice little box and a huge bag. The packaging alone must have cost $1.
I must say the name Butter Avenue really fits this place. The macron center really had a butter texture to it. The outer crust was nice a chewy and not overly sweet. The different flavors to choose from were all really tasty and definitely very distinctly different in taste. These were probably the best macrons I have tried but once again I cannot give a 5 star just because the value is not there. I know macrons are usually over priced  but $2.25 each is a bit hard to swallow. I made sure I ate every crumb because even that small piece that falls off could be like $0.25 worth."}
{"text":"I came here to meet up with someone. I was going to eat some sweets but ended up only having time for a latte. It was a good latte. If i am in the area again, i would come here for a latte. 

But the reason people probably come here is for the sweets. I didn't try any, but it definitely looked good. It definitely had a lot of macarons! I also thought the shelf of different tea they had for sales looked very interesting as well."}
{"text":"This is on my recommend list for cakes and pastries.

Butter Avenue is a chic looking place just down the street from the Loblaws @ Yonge, just  hill climb north of York Mill TTC station. It's a pretty casual chic place to grab a coffee and a pastry. I've been wanting to stop here and investigate since I saw the signage go up last year. 

Their macaron selection is ok, I showed up here at the end of the day so there wasn't as much selection as I wished ( my own fault) - but I also picked up the one of their lemon tarts - which looked lonely and pretty in the display case. 

Macaron - flavour wise - it was ok, for me it wasn't really that knock it of the park, but overall ok.

Lemon Tart  - it was pretty good, lemony and pack quite of bit of punch, since I didn't get around to eating it until a week later... a crime - but it was well worth the wait.

I'll have to come back when the weather turns nice and mild. You' ll have to find local street parking on the residental or the Green P down the street. You could try and park at the Loblaws, but I noticed that they usually keep an eye peeled for parking spot moochers."}
{"text":"Beautifully open and clean. My lemon macaron was perfection. Husband who isn't a fan of sweets enjoyed a matcha macaron."}
{"text":"We came here to grab desserts to go :) The box of 6 macarons was adorbz!  My fave flavours were matcha, earl grey and strawberry white choco.  We also got a mousse cake with a mini macaron on top, green tea flavoured. 

It's a small cafe with 3 tables (or 4?) but exquisitely decorated with a macaron layered cake on display.  Could be a nice date place, recommended to try :)"}
{"text":"The place is nearby lawborlows. There's a parking for customer. Very clean and net place. Few tables and chairs. Macaroon are so cute. The nutty dark chocolate which I ordered taste good 2. And salt caramel latte as well."}
{"text":"Decided to try this cute little Patisserie on Toronto Macaron day at the Yonge and Lawrence location! I love the interior as it is very chic and minimalistic. Outside there is a macaron tree on display which I thought was pretty cute as well. Butter Avenue offers many interesting unique flavours including Farmer's market flavours, Candy Shop flavours, as well as Coffee & Tea House flavours. There is a small little white sheet of paper as well that they give you which tells you all the flavours that they have to offer. The colourful pretty little macarons are all neatly presented in their glass display. I spent a lot of time deciding what to get, but in the end I decided to try some of the Farmer's market flavours including Tomatoe Brie, Lemon Poppy Seed, Guava Plum, as well as the Candy Shop flavours which include Amaretto Sour, and Mont Blanc (chestnut, chocolate, vanilla). As for the Tea House flavour, I decided to try Caramel Macchiato.

Every macaron tasted very delicious. When you bite into it the outer shell is somewhat crisp and the middle part is nice and moist, soft, delicate, and just chewy enough with a nice cream filling.

For the Farmer's Market flavour such as Tomatoe Brie I was actually expecting a somewhat unique sweet/salty tomatoey taste. But it was still mainly sweet.

In terms of presentation, I really liked the Lemon Poppy Seed one because one, it is made with my favourite colour which is yellow and has polka dots on it, and it tasted great. I also liked the macarons that are not only single coloured but double coloured as well (ie: 2 different colours per macaron). It was a tough choice to decide which flavours to try. 

It's a nice place to come on any afternoon to enjoy your tea and some macarons. Will recommend this place to anyone who has a sweet tooth and a love for cute little sweets"}
{"text":"The people here are so friendly and helpful! I'm sure that all of you who had bought macarons, know the difficulty of choosing flavours to try. I took forever figuring out what I wanted and they were very kind and never rushed me. I believe it was the owner who asked us what we thought of the macaron (since my friends and I were just chilling at their tables) and we had a nice conversation.

This place has the best flavours in my opinion. By this I don't necessarily mean best varieties but they have the most flavour in their macarons' fillings. Not only that but the consistency of the texture of each different macarons were pretty good (sorry, but La Bamboche still has the best texture consistency!) Their price points on their macarons are reasonable. They're definitely not the most expensive nor the cheapest but for great flavours and good consistency, I think the price is very fair.

It's a trip for me to go to Butter Avenue (as a matter of fact, I got lost with my friends trying to find this place) but if I ever pass by this place, I'll definitely pop in for a visit."}
{"text":"I tried 6 flavours - 
1. salted caramel
2. strawverry white chocolate
3. passionfruit cream cheese
4. pistachio black cherry (I think it was pistachio)
5. spring my love (saffron raspberry)
6. I don't remember the 6th one 

The flavors on all of these, except salted caramel, were very sort of meh. None has much flavor (except the salted caramel), which is probably why I don't remember what the 6th one was. 
They are pretty small in size.
The texture is alright - some of the actual cookies were a bit drier, some were a moister, with a bit more pull but the texture was pretty good and fresh
The ganache and filling also weren't very flavorful 

I've tried a lot of macarons in the city and these were so-so
I was kind of disappointed because they aren't cheap and they are sort of small 

The only good one that stood out was the salted caramel (which is why I gave them 3 stars)"}
{"text":"I had been to numerous afternoon teas in dt. So far Butter Avenue offers the best food and service, which Shangri-la or Ritz Carlton can't even compare. 
I think the selling point for Butter Avenue's afternoon tea is their food qualities, varieties and appearance. The combination of Japanese and French style reminds me those fancy afternoon tea I had back in Asia. Unlike British afternoon tea, the size of each item tends to be small (bite size) and sophisticated. The sweetness of the cakes and other sweets are always in the right amount (which is consider as less sugar desserts in North America), and the same concept applies to the savouries.
However, their tea selection is not as inclusive as the other afternoon tea's places. It only offers four options during our visit. My friend picked the Jasmine Garden and I picked the 100 Nights. We both love our tea so much that we couldn't stop drinking it.(the servers constantly coming over and ask do we need more hot water) You can also try to have a Iced-version which I believe is cold brewed tea. 
Overall, I love this place and could not wait to have another afternoon tea again soon."}
{"text":"The best location in the GTA for macarons! The outside is perfectly crisp, with a soft chewy center. 

One time, I forgot I had picked some up on the way home from Loblaws and to my amazement, they were still perfect after two days in the box. Usually, macarons get stale the next day, but the ones from Butter Avenue were just so decadent. 

I've tried many of the flavours, but my favourite by far is the sea-salt caramel. I have heard amazing reviews on Yelp about the Raspberry so that's the next one I'm going to try! The other flavours apart from the salted caramel are just a bit too sweet for me. They're not as WOW, so a star off for only having one flavour that I like since I usually just get a full box of just the salted caramel. I may change this after trying the Raspberry that's so famous among Yelpers.

However, for the price (compared to other macaron specialty patisseries) and the quality (soft and chewy inside, perfect depth, etc), this is my go-to place and exceeds other macarons by far. 

On a side note: AWESOME hours of operations and PACKAGING IS JUST SO GORGEOUS!"}
{"text":"My new favorite macaron place!

* White Chocolate Strawberry
* Caramel Sea Salt 
* Passion Fruit Cream Cheese
* Earl Grey
* Lychee 
* Macchiato

These macarons are to die for - they are so fresh and the fruit flavors are like eating actual fruits.  My top 2 are lychee and earl grey (taste like the tea!). I usually like the espresso flavors but the macchiato was way too strong.. doesn't have the delicate taste.

The actual store is not much to be in - it doesn't really have that cozy café feel unfortunately.  

The one thing I like about this place is that after 5pm there are still options to be had.  Some place I've been to after 5 have 2 choices or NO macarons at all!  

Definitely worth the trip - top notch for your French delight craving!"}
{"text":"This review is based on my recent visit to Butter Avenue for their complete afternoon tea experience, promoted on the website as \"you can taste a little bit of Paris and Tokyo all together in Toronto\". It was a hot day, so I was impressed they offered fruit-infused iced tea as an option alongside their decent selection of classic hot teas. My friends and I were quite late, but staff treated us quite well and didn't make a fuss (that said, it wasn't very busy).

Afternoon tea here is pricey - just over $50, which is the same price as what the Fairmont Royal York charges. I get that its a hot trend and a bit of an extravagance, but that also makes me more particular about the details. The savoury selection is quite meagre and this is where they might improve. We had a mini quiche (complete with a quail's egg), which was on the dry side. This was followed by an impressive retinue of artisanal breads, sweets, and my choice of three macarons, which is where they really shine! Everything looked beautiful - so much so, that pedestrians outside repeatedly stopped to look in at us through the window. 

To appeal to customers seeking a later lunch, they should round out the savoury selection with a bit more protein-containing foods. I arrived very hungry but left feeling somewhat queasy after indulging in so much sugar and bread. I'd return here for tea if they replaced some of the bread and cracker-type selection with something more substantial. Until then, I'll settle for dropping in just for their delicious macarons."}
{"text":"The matcha macaron here is great. I need to try other flavors and their tarts, which all look good. 

The staff seem pretty friendly and the space is pretty nice. Their chairs look like herman miller but are probably replicas..."}
{"text":"LOVE the decor and simplicity of it all but wasn't wow'd by the macarons...was hoping to try their croissants too but they were sold out :P  Will re-review next visit!"}
{"text":"I died and gone to sugar heaven! This was was recommended by my friend (not a yelper). We had only eaten a couple rolls of sushi for dinner, saving room to blow the quota at Butter Avenue. It certainly did not disappoint. 

The displays were so pretty! I wish theres was a bigger selection though. I'm a sucker for sweets!! I had the Vanilla Tart (Creme Chantilly vanilla, white chocolate, macarons, fresh berries). It was one of the sweetest things I'd ever eaten! $8 was certainly worth it. Next time, I'd like to try more macarons. It was so fresh & the textures were just perfect. I might even like it more than the macarons from Paris. 

I feel there could be great potential at this place esp if they offer afternoon tea, etc. Who wouldn't want a shower here & be spoiled?

Staff was friendly and efficient. Parking is available on adjacent side streets or if you go late enough, just park at loblaws (slightly north) & walk over. 

I pass by this place at least once a week & the macaron display is constantly changing."}
{"text":"i loveeeeee butter avenue! if you want CONSISTENTLY good quality macarons, this is it! the macarons here are always perfectly risen with perfect feet, perfectly round, perfect consistency and texture, perfectly crumbly, not overcooked or undercooked... and all the flavours are BANG ON. i've tried many macaron shops including nadege, la bamboche, and a couple in markham but butter avenue is the best in toronto hands down. i've also made macarons at home many times before so i know a good macaron when i see one. they are perfect here EVERY SINGLE TIME."}
{"text":"AMAZING - their pistachio tart is to die for. The best desert I have ever tasted in my life. Everything looks so cute, from the deserts to the packaging. service is always super pleasant. My favorite place in Toronto."}
{"text":"VIBE 
I was here for a UYE and it was great! Butter Avenue reminded me of Nadege - stark white walls and white tables to match. It's very clean in here. The displays of the macarons and desserts are very lovely. 

I ATE
It's all about the macarons. Strawberry and Raspberry were really sweet and tart. But really, there's no macaron I won't like. 
They also have a selection of teas that you can take home or have in the cafe. I smelt a raspberry almond tea. Yummy! 
I wanted to splurge so the benefits of hanging out with a bunch of Yelpers is that they'll try things with you and you don't have to pay full price for something. We tried the Terre a Neige dessert which were layers of brownie, chocolate, vanilla and green tea icing. The green tea was very prevalent in the taste but delicious nonetheless. Wow! That said, this decadent dessert will set you back $8.08 if you get it alone. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK
This is an avenue I'll be perusing more often. If you're uptown, this is a great indulgence."}
{"text":"my favorite place for Macaron in Toronto. they have the right texture for their shell, and full of flavours for the filling. My Face is Rose,Cassies,Earl Gray,Salted Caramel,.Chocolate. They also serve different St.Honores. Pistachio and Cassis one is really good"}
{"text":"Kind of disappointed in my Pistachio Tart. I thought it was legit a cake looking at the cream and macaroons that are on top of it. But it is all cream. It was good but very buttery. Could not eat the whole thing. The raspberry macaroon and the fresh raspberries complemented the cream very well. That part was delicious but disappointed for being deceived. None the less it is still good and the look if it is way too cute! Will def. try the other \"cakes\""}
{"text":"Free 2 hour parking in a lot 30 seconds away, and a clean simple store layout with delicious desserts. & No tax for 6+ macarons.

Probably my favorite place for macarons"}
{"text":"Okay this is an amazing place for desserts. Not only are the macarons delicious but their tarts were heavenly!

Got the St. Honore vanille $7.95 and it was so rich, flavorful and buttery. I probably could've eaten it all without any help... Though I'd feel guilty. 

Macarons $14 for 6 or $2.35 for 1. $46.50 for 20. A wide variety of flavours. Expensive but definitely worth it if youre craving macarons! 

My friend got the Easter Hunt special which was a medium sized tart with macarons on top $29.50 and it probably was amazing. 

Everything looked and tasted amazing. My mouth is still watering!"}
{"text":"Came in on a hot day to do some web design work and use their wifi. They have free wifi; just ask for the password. Immaculate interior, super sleek and clean. 

Very friendly staff. Everyone wanted to make sure I was happy, maybe because I was the only one in the shop. The iced salted caramel latte was VERY delicious but it was over $5 before tax. Not sure if extra work went into it but it tastes great compared to a regular iced caramel latte. Croissants are about $3 and are pretty good. Macarons are over $2 each. My favourite macaron was the salted caramel one. SO good. The prices seem on par with similar shops except for the iced latte which seemed a bit expensive, though it was better than most I've had. 

The place is nice and quiet and I plan on coming here again on another work-from-home day."}
{"text":"Although not a macaron fanatic myself, being a home baker, this place is by far the best macarons I've had in Toronto. Shapes, sizes and flavours were all and always consistent. They also offer many different flavours in an array of rainbow colours - very pretty to look at in the display case.

The place is good for study breaks, romantic meet ups, or casual gatherings with a friend or two (the place isn't huge so group gatherings aren't really suggested).

The tarts are equally as good; they usually have seasonal ones according to the festivities of the year (their Valentine's day tart was pretty darn cute). Keep an eye out for what they will have for the upcoming holidays.

Also tried their Green tea iced latte; almost too big to finish but was very flavourful.

This place is not cheap, but you will get what you paid for. A sweet gift for close friends or your significant other is not a bad idea if they are a fan of sweets."}
{"text":"Toronto has seen a definite explosion in macaron popularity as this colorful little confection has usurped cupcakes as the popular sweet du jour. Enter the latest macaronerie (if there is such thing?) to throw it's hat in the ring, Butter Avenue.  

Located near the plush $$$ zipcodes of Hoggs Hollow and Bedford Park on Yonge near Deloraine, you can't miss Butter Avenue as it boasts a sizeable golden yellow macaron tower of Goldfinger-esque proportions in it's window.  The interior is clinically austere and white, yet minimalistically chic nonetheless. The staff and friendly manager/owner Calvin are quite sympatico and make every effort to ensure it's patrons are well taken care of. On my visit I order the St Honore Tart for $6.95, which bears no actual resemblance to to a St Honore cake.  The tart is a stiff butter crust that envelops a rich pistachio mousse with raspberries macarons for garnish and is quite decadent.

By no means am I a macaron savant, but having tasted the charms of La Bamboche, Nadege, Moroco and the legendary Laduree, I'd say Butter Avenue is a contender for the shiny prize of best macaron in Toronto.  The macarons here come in two sizes  the standard 3.5 diameter and an adorable little bite sized version.  Texturally speaking Butter Avenue's macarons are the right combination of delicate and flaky, jelly centred sweetness.

Much thanks to Joe H. for his UYE introduction to Butter Avenue, I now have a new place to further indulge my sugar/crack addiction, but for macarons this good it's worth the saccharine high!"}
{"text":"Had the lychee and raspberry macaron dessert. It was super cute n quirky, but was just a very light-textured, flavored whipped cream in a tart with some tiny macarons on top. 

Appealing to the eye, but I feel like I spiked my sugar and wasted my calories for nothing. 

Sugar sugar sugar. Lacking the drama it appears to have."}
{"text":"SOOO GOOD!!!
But soooo expensive!! ;-;

Basically spent all my money here *cries*, but it was worth it :')
The macarons were super good and I loved the matcha green tea brownie cake! They have a very wide range of flavours, so indecisive people, beware. Everything was very delicious and the environment was very relaxing as well.

There were really little tables though so it's hard to find a spot to sit down if you're with your friends.

A must try!"}
{"text":"Just alright macaroons but very expensive. In a quiet neighbourhood and atmosphere is empty. Would not return unless I am desperate for macaroons."}
{"text":"Im almost upset at myself for falling into the trap. The trap of being lured in with these amazing soft yet chewy bites of delight. How can something so small make me so incredibly happy? The first macaron i ever tried was the real deal, it was a Laduree macaron in Paris and ever since I have been hooked on these.  Ive tried many macaron places but i must say that the macarons at Butter avenue are as close as it gets to the macarons i had in Paris. 
My favourite flavours are the lavender, green tea, and earl grey. My least favourite would have to be the lemon. Overall, the flavours are very natural tasting and dont give off that very fake artificial after taste. I must say that I haven't tried any of their other desserts but why would I when i can have macarons? 
I come here almost 4 times a month and every time is more enjoyable as the last. This is also a great place to get a gift for a girlfriend or loved one because their packaging is super cute and their macarons are super delish!"}
{"text":"I don't like that much the way the store is set or the  all white bland deco of it, but these macarons have achieved to be my best ones in Toronto now, before nadege..."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday night at 9pm, and had no line-up to wait through! Maybe I was expecting a \"Magnum\" size line considering Butter's reputation, but definitely a pleasant surprise.

Got a half dozen, including their tried-and-true Salted Caramel, and tried the Earl Grey, Cream Cheese Passionfruit and La Vie En Rose, among others. Salted Caramel was amazeballs!! Worth the hype! Earl Grey was very true to its name. The CCP was yummy, the passionfruit was nicely sharp. La Vie En Rose.....erm....I forgot what the nice Butter staff told me it should taste like, and my usual taste-identifying skills couldn't tell me the answer either. It just tasted...sweet. 

Overall, for $2.50 a macaron, the quality was good, and the flavours were disturbingly addictive."}
{"text":"Really limited seating so don't expect to be able to spontaneously visit and enjoy your pastry while seated if you're visiting at a busy hour. You definitely can call ahead to reserve, but not sure if that's only for their afternoon tea offering. Parking is on the street, but you can definitely park at the nearby Loblaw if you're quickly popping in and out.

However, the macarons and the pastries are amazing!! My favorite is the earl grey and the different variety of matchas."}
{"text":"I've been on a search for a good French Macaron for awhile. Coming from Michigan, there aren't many good places-- most are either filled with buttercream (which are too rich and buttery for my liking) or are cracked and crumbled by the time you purchase them. Prior to our vacation to Toronto, I decided to search for patisseries that made good French Macarons. I stumbled across many positive reviews from Butter Avenue (and also many great pictures!)

On our first day in Toronto, we stopped by and purchased a box of 6 French Macarons for $13.50 as well as two pastries -  the St. Honore Mango ($7.50) and Terre Et Neige ($7.15). We also purchased a container of mini macarons and three additional pastries for our family friends we were visiting! For the Macarons, they had many choices for it being 1-2 o'clock in the afternoon. We ordered the Salted Caramel, Caramel Macchiato, Cream Cheese Passionfruit, White Chocolate Strawberry, Lychee and Raspberry, and Matcha. Our favorites were the Salted Caramel, Caramel Macchiato, White Chocolate Strawberry, and Lychee and Raspberry. :) The owner/worker also gave us a bag of Chocolate Hazelnut (Langues de chat) for free! (Thanks again! :) ) The pastries were both very delicious ( light and not too sweet - but how I like it). On our last day in Toronto, we returned to purchase more French Macarons and two more pastries to bring home.

We purchased three boxes of six (three going to family friends back in Michigan) and one for ourselves. We chose majority of the same flavors that we enjoyed and ordered two more pastries -- the Terre Et Neige again (sooo delicous), and the St Honore Aux Pistachio (which was soo delicous! - I'm not a pistachio person at all and I enjoyed this dessert). 

Staff was very welcoming and kind, and desserts are amazing. Great selection, and very fresh! Pastries are light, fragrant, and not too sweet! One recommendation I would suggest is to create a pastry that doesn't have any nuts in it! (We wanted to purchase one for another friend back home with a nut allergy but unfortunately the worker was unsure of which had nuts and macarons have almond powder) 

Highly recommend! Will definitely return on our next vacation here :)"}
{"text":"The best macarons that I've had. They were crunchy, chewy and not too sweet. My boyfriend and I got the Salted Caramel, Caramel Macchiato, Cream Cheese Passionfruit, White Chocolate Strawberry, Lychee and Raspberry, and Raspberry. Within a minute, we were done all 6! I liked the White Chocolate Strawberry the best of all. The Caramel Macchiato tasted just like caramel to me, no coffee flavour. The Cream Cheese Passionfruit and the Lychee Raspberry were interesting, but I'm not a fan of fruit flavoured macarons. The Salted Caramel didn't live up to the hype, I've had better at Pastisserie 27. My boyfriend liked the Raspberry most because of the jam filling."}
{"text":"Macaron..... Marcaron.......Macaron....,.at Butter Avenue

I got 6 of those of different flavours for $13.50... Even before I know, my Yelp Drinking Buddy just pop one of that in his mouth and swallow that!!! Didn't he knows that it just cost me over $2++!!! Now I have to teach him how to enjoy and savour these work of art!

My favourite is Matcha... just like a big explosion of matcha flavour... crunchy outer cell and just a hint of sweetness but hey Matcha is good for me?! Can I have 10 of those?

Terre et Neige (green tea mousse, semi-sweet brownie, soft chocolate biscuit & light crémeux) with taxes come out to be $8!!!! Good but I could not expect anything less at that price point! 

The staffs are wonderful... cheerful and friendly... All I kept saying the whole night was Matcha, I think I am on sugar high.....

Thanks Joe H for organizing the UYE.... 

Matcha Rules!!!"}
{"text":"Did a dropby last month to grab some macarons for Valentine's day and it was my first time here. The simple modern decor gave the cafe a nice and peaceful vibe and presented behind the counted is a wide selection of macarons. 

Though all the macarons I got that day were very tasty, I was really taken back by its size. It was like bite size for about the same price as other places.

If you buy more than 6 macarons, it is tax free.

TIP: Park at Loblaws grocery store and walk over to avoid paid parking on Yonge."}

I love the variety of flavours they offer from classic raspberry to the more adventurous flavour of tomato and cheese. My favourite flavour would is the lychee raspberry. It's perfect balance between sweet and sour as the sweetness of the lychee is cut by the raspberry jelly in the middle of the macaron. Even though this cafe is known for macarons, I usually order their cakes/tarts more often. My all time favourite is the mango tart which is available in summertime but seeing as it's winter, I'll settle for Frosty, a super cute snowman cake that tastes of vanilla and coffee :) 

Tl;dr
-basically the best place ever
-get 6 macarons to save on tax
-must tries: lychee raspberry macaron, any cake"}
{"text":"Let me be that annoying girl that's been on exchange and comes back telling you about all the wonderful food she's had there and how it doesn't compare - jokes. 

But seriously, macarons here aren't the best, but they aren't terrible either. I haven't found the best macaron shop yet in Toronto but Butter Avenue does a pretty good job of trying. Why I don't fancy their macarons too much is because their macaron shell is a bit sticky and dense - not the light crumbly shell I know of and love. Their filling also lacks a real punch of flavour. I do like thar they offer Asian fusion flavours though, so points for creativity! 

I also checked out their afternoon tea, it's more dessert heavy compared to actual afternoon tea and for roughly the same price too so I wasn't too impressed. I'm not sure if they even have a kitchen at this location or if the items were just shipped here. They only have like 4 tables here and I don't think they carry most of their afternoon tea items regularly so yes, make a reservation. However, if you're looking for an actual afternoon tea experience, your best bet is to probably look elsewhere.

Overall, good place to grab a quick macaron to satisfy your cravings but don't count on it to be anything special."}
{"text":"I would probably never ever visit this dessert place if it wasn't for yesterday's Yelp event. You will definitely not miss this store due to it's very elegant macaron display by the front window.

I already knew going in that macarons are quite pricey so I wasn't surprised by their pricing. The cakes however were quite expensive and I would never imagine myself paying ~$7.50 for a small slice of cake. A box of 6 full-sized macarons will cost you $15.26 (including tax). The macarons are made to perfection because the outer shell is crunchy and doesn't break easily. The sweetness actually kicks in when you bite into the middle of the macaron. It's a bit sweet for me but other than that it's pretty good.

The service is excellent here because the staff are very helpful and will provide recommendations as well. 

The store is very clean and modern looking. There are only a few tables that you can enjoy your desserts at. However, yesterday there wasn't enough seating for everyone because there was an event going on. However, I think there would be enough seating on a typical day.

PS: There's a Loblaws right beside this place so you can \"buy\" something at Loblaws and leave your car there."}
{"text":"This review is based on their macarons only. I tried 6 different flavours but they all tasted very similar. Based on my previous experiences like bobette & belle and ladurée, butter avenue's macaron's fillings lacked depth in flavour and only tasted like sugar. No wow factor. The shells were really light and did not have that soft and chewy center. Maybe it is their concept or maybe they skimp out on almond flour. Nevertheless I like soft and chewy and bursts of flavour. 2/5 is my verdict."}
