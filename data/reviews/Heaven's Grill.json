{"text":"I started off giving Heaven's Grill a 5 star review due to their friendly service great food (despite questionable food portions) After food poisoning on one occasion, numerous unsatisfactory breakfast and service; I will will no longer be returning or referring this eatery."}
{"text":"This place is a little neighborhood joint with solid food meant to feed and not impress.  I had the $6.99 quarter chicken combo for lunch with rice and grilled vegetables, it was fresh and delicious. I think its a safe bet for lunch anytime."}
{"text":"This is one of our favourites! Very casual place, never too busy, and the food is delicious.... Try the Korean beef! Love the staff. They're very gracious and they always remember us."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner. Prices were great, portion size was great, staff were friendly, and the food itself was really good. The dinner itself was very clean and nice looking.  Had some healthier options with grilled and steamed vegetables as sides, and they were tasty."}
{"text":"Dont trust the menu price. I ordered the quarter chicken ($6.99) + Crepe ($2.99) = $10 + tax = $11.3 but was charged $12.40. Friend ordered the quarter chicken ($6.99) + Pop ($1.00) = $8 + tax = $9.04 but was charged $10.xx. Apparently there's a markup of $0.5 to $1.0 somewhere along the line.  Food wise, the quarter chicken was tiny and blend. Garlic rice was re-heated using microwave. Dont think i'll come again.  If crave for grill chicken, costa verde is a much better choice than this..."}
{"text":"As the other reviewer (Hi Tara!) stated, working in this area, there are very few options.  A lot of people at the office recommended Heaven's Grill.    I'll start with the positives; the restaurant is clean, the food is very good, the pricing is an excellent value, and the staff are very friendly.  I know what you're thinking \"WTF, Scott?  Where did the extra stars for your review go?\".  Well kids, I'll tell you where they went...they went to the same place that the second chicken breast went on 3 of the 5 times I ordered the double quarter combo for takeout, only to get back to the office to find out I paid for two, but only received one.   \"Sorry, Sir!\".    To give you some insight, here's a snapshot of my days: -  wake at 5:30am, get ready, eat breakfast, on the road by 6:30am -  drive to work for 45-60 minutes, arriving around 7:30 -  9:30am..start thinking about lunch -  10:30am...man, I'm hungry...discuss lunch options  -  11:00-11:30am it's time for action -  12:00pm food must be ready for eating  Here's where Heaven's Grill misses the mark: - calling in an order is hit and miss...sometimes they answer the phone, sometimes, not so much...\"Sorry, Sir!\" - there's no point to calling in an order because when you arrive at the predetermined time, your order is nowhere near ready so you sit and wait 10 minutes while they prepare your order...or part of it at least.  \"Sorry, Sir!\" -  rotisserie chicken for lunch?  Fantastic!  Showing up at noon to see pale uncooked birds spinning on the rotisserie nowhere near ready for lunch?  Frustrating.  \"Sorry, Sir!\".  If I liked eating lunch at 3:00pm, they'd be hot and ready!  \"Sorry, Sir!\"  I'm not overly demanding, I just want lunch at lunch time, and upon returning to my office, I want to open my package to see what I ordered...in full...without having to drive back or hear the most frequently spoken phrase by their very friendly staff...you've figured it out by now...\"Sorry, Sir!\".    If you have the patience of a saint, time on your hands, or aren't driven by a belief that you shouldn't have to teach people how to run their businesses, Heaven's Grill is 4 stars all day.     While batting .400 might make you a superstar in the majors, it sure as hell doesn't cut it when it comes to my lunch order accuracy.  I've given them more chances than I ever would if there were more choices in the area, but as it sits, I can't go back.  I want chicken, not a deluge of apologies.    \"Sorry, Sir!\""}
{"text":"I don't even give this place a star!!! Food unfresh! Staff rude!!! And I got sick from eating their bacon! Would never go back there again!"}
{"text":"Not bad. I came in here for a cheap, solo dinner.   The place is clean and nice, and the service is friendly. I ordered the 1/4 chicken (LOVE rotisserie chicken) and was happy to have a whole bevy of sides to eat it with. I chose green beans and steamed veggies in an effort to be healthy.  The chicken was a bit dry/overcooked, but it came with a dipping sauce that was tasty. The vegetables were perfect.  They didn't rush me, which was great because I had an hour to kill. Looks like they do quite a bit of takeout business. I'd go again if I were craving chicken and in the area."}
{"text":"5 stars- how rare it is for me to hand these out!  However- a picture says a thousand words, but in this case its not enough. Small family run establishment- however the quality of the food and the presentation can go head to head against the giant corporate restaurant chains.  The best part about this place is the price. I could not imagine what $20 got me here. Half Chicken (Gravy) - Korean Beef Combo- Springrolls - Steamed Veg   All items were phenomenal.   Sometimes i Feeeeeel like i walked out of HEAVEN!!!!!"}
{"text":"I met two friends there on 12 July 2017, and the service was quick and the food was delicious.  We all ordered the chicken and it was plentiful, tasty and moist.  It was my first visit but my two friends had been there before and everyone seemed to know each other. I did order a bottle of water, not realizing a glass of water would be provided. For the three of us the bill came to $32.74 which is quite reasonable.    Very friendly place and I will definitely go back again. They are closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"I've come here 3 times and haven't had a problem. I've had the Korean beef, quarter chicken, and pork chop, all of which I found really yummy. The menu is pretty small, but the prices are fairly cheap and the food is really good and the portion is filling. I went with my mom for lunch today to sit in for the first time, the service was really quick and really accommodating (I think their dine-in service is a tad quicker than their take-out, but don't trust me, I'm poor judge of time passing)  I tried the pork chop and fried egg, with a side of grilled veggies and pickled papaya. My mom got the quarter chicken with garlic rice (my favourite side dish!) and spring rolls. The pork chop was grilled really well! Nice and juicy, and perfect with the soy sauce dipping sauce. The pickled papaya I found a bit too gingery; I couldn't have too much at a time. I tried my mom's spring roll and it was really yummy too.  I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Always great food and friendly service! Their breakfast is great value and Korean ribs and spring rolls are always hot and fresh. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Working in the middle of no man's land (Allen Road and Wilson)....this is really the only option within walking distance to my workplace. Fortunately it is a delightful surprise. The staff seem to be of some sort of Philippino descent and they are extremely courteous and friendly. The servers go above and beyond when it comes to customer service.  You can get a quarter chicken dinner with two sides and a drink for a mere $6.99.  They have several varities of CREPES!! for only $2.99!!  The restaurant is dimly lit and very clean - not a greasy spoon as it would appear on the outside.  Definitely recommend this place if you live or work up in the middle of nowhere!"}
