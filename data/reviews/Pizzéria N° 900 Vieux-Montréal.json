{"text":"found this little gem while walking around old montreal - we loved this joint. the decor was cute, the pizza was REALLY good - i got the margarita, my friend got marinara & my other friend got the prosciutto pizza. i'd give it 5 stars however service was a tad slow so i will give it 4. Definitely would recommend this place, especially if you're from NY like we are & you eat pizza often!"}
{"text":"A tight space to enjoy some of the best pizza in Montreal. Now that's hard to find since personally I haven't found the best pizza in Montreal any time I've ordered but these guys beat most pizza I've ever eaten anywhere.  The drink selection is excellent, cultivated to pair perfectly with the artisan pizza menu.  This is no cheese and pepperoni place, go elsewhere if you've desires of \"traditional\" pizza, go here if you want to discover."}
{"text":"The best and the worst experience at the same time. Pizza was really great, we ordered calzone and speck pizza. Tomato and white sauces were both excellent, dough was crust enough and not dry at all, all my best to chef of this place. BUT staff is more than terrible! First of all they kindly ask you what water would you prefer still or sparkling, but they don't mention that it is not a compliment from the restaurant, but a beginning of your order. So when you receive a bill, you become surprised of 6$ bottle. Secondly, we waited for about 30 minutes! to remove our empty plates from the table, that is incredible. And the least but not the last thing to my mind, we were waiting about 20 minutes for ANY attention to us from the staff, and , of course, at the end of our 'great' evening, we waited for our bill after that for more than 30 min. To clear the situation I want to mention that place was busy, but it was not overcrowded. It is a pity when such unqualified staff ruins such a great place with great cuisine."}
{"text":"Cool space, great pizza, nice staff, and good vibes. If your in the old port, must try."}
{"text":"We were vacationing in Montreal near the old city, and wanted dinner. Our first choice turned out to be closed for renovation, but we had spotted this outpost of a local chain on Rue McGill, and thought a good pizza sounded good.  It really is small, wedged into a parking lot with 50 tightly packed seats. The pizza oven is on display and looks very cool. Our waitress switched somewhat uneasily to English, but she did just fine in taking our orders and making suggestions. The beer selection was disappointing, so I had red wine instead, and when they ran out of that one, she suggested another that I actually liked more than the first.  We each had arugula salad and a pizza. The salads were quite generous and tasty, and the pizzas are the sort I favor: Neapolitan style with thin crust and light toppings, and they're small enough that one person can have his own. We loved the bright tomato sauce and cheese, but crust is the thing in pizza, and this is crisp and slightly chewy with those sexy char marks.  It's not the cheap, nasty product most people think of as pizza, and for that we were grateful."}
{"text":"I got the spicy pancetta and fig pizza and it was DELICIOUS. The crust was amazing. My husband got the sausage and pesto pizza and loved it. The melted Parmesan appetizer was superb. I can't wait to return and try a different pizza.   We sat at the bar and had great service. We were able to see all the food being made which was neat.   We went for lunch and had a 15 minute wait. Totally worth it. The restaurant seating area is small but cozy, not sure what dinner is like.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Old Port and in addition to that they are totally inexpensive. Bonus! Being a pizza connoseur and freshly back from a trip to Italy, I'm convinced that the price to quality ratio of these pizzas are the best in the city- that's definitely rare in this fancy area of town.  The sauce is spot on San Marzano, the mozzarella is definitely fresh, the crust could be a bit more bubbly but I'm not complaining. They are close to the real deal which is hard to find here.   The decor is new and modern and I can't help but think this place would be ideal for a nice family dinner or date. Definitely my go to take out place from now on."}
{"text":"We had to check out this place when we saw it walking by on McGill street. We shared the Speck salad and one Margherita pizza. Looking back, I wish we had ordered another pizza because it was SO delicious and I am hungry again! We finished off by splitting an order of cannolis. Everything was fantastic. The space is trendy and beautiful and there is plenty of seating near the windows for great people watching. Thanks for making our first trip to Montreal delicious and memorable!"}
{"text":"After going online and looking at their website, I was a little reluctant upon seeing that this is a chain throughout the area.  However, since it was near the place we were staying and we had just spent the day traveling, something simple and nearby fit the bill on this occasion.  Happily, both of us were pleased with our pizzas.  The dough is well-cooked, but still has a softness and airiness in the center that lets it retain a delicious flavor.  The tomato sauce sauce was applied evenly and it has a sweetness that went well with the dough.  For $10, I don't think there are a lot of better options in the area."}
{"text":"This pizza place is in between the financial district and the old port. We went there with my colleagues for a lunch. It's a small, crowded place, noisy; I wouldn't recommend it if you have a business meeting, I couldn't hear the person next tome! We all ordered pizzas; a Margherita bianca, Prosciutto and Mild italian sausage. They were okay, the pizza dough was good!"}
{"text":"It seems that on Monday nights a lot of the good places are either closed or fully booked (despite being half empty at 7pm), so I wandered into this bustling little place that had a free table.  I no doubt ordered too much, but there was burrata on the menu! Burrata Maison was delicious with a couple of pieces of flatbread and little cherry tomato salad. I forget the name of the pizza. It had spicy pancetta, arugula, ch√®vre and figs. OMG amazing Neapolitan pizza!   Can't give five stars after receiving the French menu when I spoke English. My ability to read French is decent but the person seating me did not know that."}
{"text":"After passing this place for ages, I finally decided to try it out. I ordered the Brunch pizza, and it was excellent. The pizza dough was fresh, and tasted great. I especially liked the selection of pizza without tomato base, as I can't have tomatoes. The toppings are not over-kill, either, and balance each other well. Desserts are equally well portioned and delicious.   The restaurant itself is a bit small, but it's cozy. There are windows lining the entire wall so you can easily see outside, and light comes through well.  Honestly, I usually order a quick pizza from dominos when I don't want to cook, but with Pizzeria No. 900's similar price range and better quality, I think I'll be ordering from here more often."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favourite pizza place in Montreal! I have been here 3 times so far and each time I have walked out happy. The food and service both have met and exceeded my expectations. Their Porcini pizza is a must try! It's the kind of pizza that you would crave once you have had it."}
{"text":"High end pizza restaurant in a long narrow locale.  The pizza I ordered was good, but not well executed (toppings thrown on). Service was good and fast. The main problem here is the noise: the decibel level is very high, to the point of being disturbing. The decor does not help: ceramic tile wall amplifies the sound.  This might be a better choice midday when it is less crowded.  Prices are in line with the area: pizza, salad and beer for 38$ tip included."}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza, great staff and charming place in the old port. Every pizza I've tried so far is great and very reasonably priced. Stop by for lunch or dinner and experience this new spot."}
