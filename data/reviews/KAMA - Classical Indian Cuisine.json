{"text":"Bathrooms were very dirty and toilets were all clogged.
Buffets items had lots of deep fried very oily choices.
Butter chicken was pretty tasty until I noticed a COCKROACH on my plate. I nearly \"Ralphed\" right there in the restaurant.  I asked the waiter for the Bill not sure how to even describe the event without wanting to hack. The waiter was confused to why we wanted to leave so quickly with our plates full of food. My husband politely said we kinda lost our appetite because we found a bug in our food. The waiter apologized and took our plates and went to the kitchen. He can back saying that 2 days ago the fumigated for roaches and that possibly one could have fallen in that was dead already. He also said that he wasn't going to charge us. He apologized again and we left. All the servers were super friendly, kind and understanding. I even feel bad about writing this review. Although I thought I still should... I think they need to close down and ensure the kitchen is up to code before re-opening."}
{"text":"Went there with a Groupon with my husband on Sunday for a dinner buffet.  As many reviewers have already indicated the buffet options are minimal; that said, they have the most popular Indian food e.g.

Food:  overall okay...meh! 
 Meats:  curry lamb, tandoori chicken, curry basa fish and butter chicken. 
Vegetarian: curry lentil, mixed veg, basmati rice and some other curry.  
Salad Bar: green salad, mixed salad, kale salad, condiments and some deep fried food (spring rolls, samosa, pakora.
Naan: ask server for either garlic or plain  
  
**I found the temperature of the food was a bit on the cool side and not hot enough.

Service : good service if there aren't a lot of customers- they don't have enough staff

Overall: With this Groupon,  it comes with any drinks including beer, house wine and even mango Lassi.   Overall for the price we paid, good value.  But probably won't be coming back...definitely have had better Indian food."}
{"text":"Wow! What an experience. 

Will be calling Toronto Public Health department about this. 

We went to the Groupon sponsored buffet on Oct 26th, and my son discovered a buffet of cockroaches on top of the dessert bar.  

Yes, cockroaches with newly hatched babies!  When confronted, the waiter did nothing. I called for the owner, and the manager - Ken Clark - showed up apologizing, and blaming a fumigation of the building next door as the reason for cockroaches.  

The fact is - the place is dirty as hell. He offered a free meal and a come back voucher...what the heck! Why would anyone come back to a place filled with cockroaches?  

Ban Kama from Toronto! DO NOT EAT Here!!!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre food. Most dishes were not spicy or flavourful enough.  The naan is decent, but they limit it to a few pieces per table.  I have had my Indian friends make homemade Indian food for me, and I think KAMA's food is seriously lacking Indian spices and flavours.

There was this rum and raisin ice cream that was pretty gross lol.  There is honestly not a single dish we would come back for."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been fans of Kama for years now. It's an especially great deal because we purchased a whole slew of TeamBuy vouchers.

The only problem I have is that I always end the meal by saying \"we're never coming back here again\" because I need to be rolled out ... but we keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Went to Kama again recently and noticed a distinct improvement in the food! Used to be sort of white people Indian fod but now it tastes much more authentic! I actually mentioned it to the manager and was told that they recently got a new head chef.
Any reviews that are more than a month or two old are probably not relevant!! 

Not cheap but the buffet makes it well worth it.

Lots of vegetarian dishes too!!!"}
{"text":"We were there for their buffet last night and felt that the food was not good, service was just okay and ambience was old and kind of dirty.  I wouldn't recommend it.

The only positive thing was the amount of selection in the buffett. I only tried the butter chicken and didn't try anything else."}
{"text":"We went here because we had a Groupon. The ambiance was quite nice, and it wasn't crowded. The buffet had a number of delicious offerings, however all of the flavours were subdued - nothing had any level of spice that you would expect from Indian food. My husband found a piece of plastic in his food, which was kind of a turn off. That really ruined our appetite.  If we had another Groupon, we may go back, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit again."}
{"text":"Decided to check out Kama before going to a TSO concert, since I have a subscriber discount card that gets me 15% off there (and various other deals at other theatre-district eateries). The service was a bit brusque, but the waiter got points in my book for deducting the discount before I even had a chance to flash the card.

Dinner's a self-serve, all you can eat buffet, so if you come hungry, you'll definitely get your money's worth. The dishes are all quite tasty (I sampled pretty much everything on offer), but there aren't too many overly spicy ones, which might make Kama a good choice for those with more sensitive stomachs."}
{"text":"The location is great however for the kind of food, service and decor I think it's extremely overpriced. I got a groupon coupon and went to dinner with my spouse as part of birthday celebrations. Just at the start of the evening I went to the buffet area and started looking for the fool when I saw a cockroach going around the food. It was the WORST feeling ever and I felt I was going to vomit during the dinner and I did not tell my wife not to ruin the dinner however it was so disgusting that there is no excuse for this. It has been my worst experience in a restaurant and I don't even want to imagine the kitchen. Disgusting"}
{"text":"Had Lunch here with friends last week. The food was excellent. Fresh and hot. The service was also excellent. I didnt have to wait for the plates to be cleared or for the water to be replenished. 
I'll definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon for dinner buffet for two here. Half the buffet items were tepid in temperature, and the other half were overcooked. Naan was bland and paper thin but papadums and sauces were quite nice. It could've been that we went too late, so I'd give them another chance. Tandoori chicken was well done in my opinion. The buffet table did have a lot of variety and the mango lassi I had was also very tasty. 

Bathrooms were clean and big (check out the 3D picture on the door of the woman's washroom, ha ha) ...also, there were blonde russian twins working as waitresses so that was kind of a bonus. I haven't been to many indian restaurants in Toronto both the buffets at Jodhpore Club and Mount Everest were much better."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet.  Would not return.  Food was very low quality and not authentic.  You had to search and search to find meat in the curries and by the time we got to the dessert, the gulab jamuns were all gone.  Would have expected more for the price."}
{"text":"Cockroach in the food! Need I say more. This place is beyond filthy. Kama was a recommendation by the concierge as a nice indian place to try nearby. It was buffet style on a monday night and the food was ehhhh, but then I found a cockroach in a lentil dish. Awesome! (sarcasm) Glad I didn't eat it but who's to say I didn't eat other vermin in the rest of my food. NEVER EVER EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch buffet with groupon.

There was a decent selection for lunch but something just wasn't right.

The food wasn't warm. 
It wasn't exceptional or that tasty. 
The white tablecloth had a stain on it from the last guest.
As soon my guest and I left the restaurant we both felt a slight stomach ache.
I felt like Indian food at a food court would have been better.

This place is a tourist trap and there are better Indian places in Toronto."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the negative reviews on here are about. Maybe it depends if you dine in. I ordered take-out saag paneer and garlic naan and it was fantastic. Portion was comparable to the price, both were piping hot, the staff was really nice and offered me water and a seat on the couch while I waited for my food. I will absolutely come back again."}
{"text":"Went here at 9pm. Got the end of the day leftovers. Also agree there should be samosas instead of springrolls...wtf. Got rushed 3 times by the servers to \"hurry up\" and get out. They brought us our bill before we asked for it. Also, the manager was seen doddling around standing in the buffet section just stirring the curries & staring off into space. Weird place, especially for King street. For a cheaper price you might as well get indian food in the food court. 

Ps. No ice cream, it had freezer burn and couldnt even scoop it out and whatever we could scrape out ended up tasting expired."}
{"text":"We had earlier visited Kama Restaurant in Dec 2015 and found it be quite an ordinary indian buffet. However, based on my friend's suggestion, we went ahead and bought two groupons of them in June 2016. We selected the option of \"One Lunch Buffet for Two People and Two Non-Alcoholic Drinks Valid Thursday-Sunday\" for $20.  

Our first visit in Sept 2016 was a lukewarm one. As expected it was an ordinary buffet with some dishes good and some below average. 

We again went in Oct 2016 and this time we went on a Saturday and the food was delicious. The food was hot and seemed to be freshly prepared. If you like hustle bustle then this place is not for you since during all of our 3 visits, this restaurant was quiet and peaceful. Our server Sajib was pretty good and was always attentive of our needs. 

Overall, I would say this is a just above average indian buffet place and it would be a hit or miss with them depending on the time and day you go. Am satisfied with our visit with groupon for $27 total for 2 persons.

P.S. In Little India at Queen it is $17 per person without any soft drinks."}
{"text":"I had bought a groupon for here and it was great! The service was awesome and so friendly. Loved the butter chicken and garlic naan bread. Will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"The lunch, service and ambience was stellar. Came here for lunch and had an unforgettable experience. I was greeted by a very cool server Arpit & promptly seated. As busy as it was, he didn't seem rushed and even made time to chat with me. The service was impeccable & food was nothing short of amazing as well. The manager Jay was so friendly and personally greeted me and sat with me and offered me non-alcoholic drinks. I have never experienced a manager sitting and chatting with his customers like him. Everyone seemed to like him and respect him.

Food - I had the lunch buffet and the food was warm and tasty. Even though I reached a bit late the staff did not hastily ask me to speed up. After the lunch buffet closed at 2.30pm, I had the wonderful staff Jay, Arpit, Dwayne & 1 more server that I fail to recollect his name wait patiently for me to finish up and share few jokes. The staff was super accommodating. I will be going back for sure with my friends. 

This place is a must on King street for the locals and visitors in the city :)"}
{"text":"I've been there many times.... I would have given this 4 stars previously.
After my last visit, I'm not so sure.
I can't put my finger on it, perhaps the buffet is worse or my tastes are changing, but the food was not doing anything for me, even though 90% of it was the same selection as all my previous visits.

One thing that is definitely a minus is the naan is not at the buffet anymore, they bring a basket to the table.... not a big deal but it's only the regular naan!!!! why???? we asked if there was some garlic naan, and they brought us regular naan which had been covered with (what I believe) was garlic butter spread - definitely not the garlic naan they used to have at the buffet.

** bring back the garlic naan, bring it back to me, sweet lovely garlic naan-y **"}
{"text":"Lately I've been really craving Indian food and this was the second of hopefully many Indian restaurants which I'll be dining at over the next few weeks. 

With that being said, dining at this restaurant was kind of a disappointment. But hey, at least it was a buffet.

I immediately rushed to the buffet after being seated and the first thing I noticed were spring rolls. In an Indian buffet. I may not be the most informed person about Indian cuisine but I know enough to know that spring rolls do not belong and made me feel that the food was inauthentic and cheap.

I then made my way to the main course area, where I was shocked yet again to only see one curry dish in the entire buffet (not that it was a very large buffet to begin with, sadly) which was curry lamb. 

The lamb was disappointingly mild and flavourless.

I will however say that the garlic naan and gulab were pretty good.

I mean, at least it was cheap. But if you're looking for an Indian buffet, you should consider The Indian Hut by Church and Bloor, the food's better and also a bit cheaper."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Friday to satisfy my Indian food craving. They have both eat in (13$) and take out (10.50$) options for lunch. I tried the tandoori chicken, lamb chops curry, butter chicken, beef curry and sarson ka saag. As you can tell, I enjoy eating a lot of meat at buffets. The butter chicken was a tad sweet but everything else was quite fresh and tasty.

The place is huge if you want to go there for a group lunch. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Came here for buffet on a Friday night at 6:30 and the place was 70% empty, never a good sign. The buffet selection was disappointing, and what thy did have was lacklustre at best, the only redeeming thing was the fresh fruit. The worst part, they ran out of the vanilla and chocolate ice cream. Will never come back even with all the groupons they have..."}
{"text":"Bought a teambuy coupon for the lunch buffet.  Food was pretty good.  Our favourite was the butter chicken.  It was sweet more than salty which is how we like it.  Good variety of food.  Also liked the mango dessert.

However we were charged and automatic 19% tip on our bill.  So we're taking off a star."}
{"text":"Butter chicken here is delicious! Staff was really good and the live band music was great, too. Just one thing I wish was there was ice cream but other than that the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"If you plan on eating food with very cold and buffet brought, then do so here, waste of money to call anyone a chef there, for the service is why the star was given, attentive and possibly only reason I would go, I told them the complaint and I wasn't charged so I tipped the waiter $20 for both servers. I wouldn't go in free meal and not tip. That's rude and not the servers fault for bad chef and owner. Kindly work on food, as it's embarrassing for that prime of a location."}
{"text":"Kama, Kama, Kama, Kama, Kama Chameleon - You come and go, You come and go (oh oh oh)

Inconsistency is the hobgoblin of THIS RESTAURANT.

I have been eating at Kama since Indian food was considered exotic in Toronto.  They have historically been a super-dependable spot for RIOMANIC (rapid ingestion of mass amounts North Indian curry) in the entertainment district.  

While that is GENERALLY true, there have been a few times lately that have given me cause to pause... Is there an exchange program going on with a restaurant in Norway or something?

Like many/most of the old school Indian restaurants in the city, Kama serves Northern Indian style food invariably prepared by Southerners, or Sri Lankans.  Kama is not a victim of regional confusion or Fusion (if it is deployed proactively as a marketing device...._) simply put, someone is adding sugar.  Lots of it.  There is a lot of sweet going on where it doesn't belong.  

This isn't a consistent issue - been there several times recently and the comfort food was suitably comforting and familiar.  However. with loads of really good new places opening their doors Kama had better get and retain some of the old magic or it may well find itself thrown into the bucket marked \"FOR TOURISTS ONLY\""}
{"text":"The food really was not very good.   I ordered off the menu rather than sampling a lot of dishes in the buffet so maybe I was just unlucky, but the meat in the butter chicken was rather tough, and the naan was not all that good.  However, the service was quite good.  Nevertheless, food is what keeps me coming to a restaurant, and this food didn't meet my expectations."}
{"text":"Tried the lunch buffet on a Groupon and we will not be back. 

Service was good. Food...ugh. When you see spring rolls at an Indian buffet, that's probably a bad sign. My veggie pakora was too doughy and undercooked. I might have spit out some food and hid it under some other uneaten food when no one was looking. 

I liked the lamb curry. Everything lacked spice though. I feel like they Westernized their dishes too much. 

I would rather a  place that had fewer dishes but quality, rather than the large assortment of not so tasty food. 

There are far better Indian places close by for cheaper."}
{"text":"Having come here several times over the years, KAMA is a solid but unspectacular Indian restaurant.

Known for their AYCE lunch and dinner buffets, the ambience of the restaurant itself is a bit strange. There's very little service, the buffet itself is located a fair distance from the tables (which makes you feel a bit awkward while walking back to your seat) and it has the vibe of a small-town restaurant, despite being in the heart of the city and located across the street from Roy Thomson Hall. It's a place that's clearly designed to seat a lot of people, but most of the time, I found it to be strangely empty and unappealing.

Food selection is solid overall, ranging from classics like butter chicken and masala to vegetarian dishes like Paneer Kadai, and a wide assortment of desserts, but the presentation is fairly plain. Regardless, the quality was very good across the board and is the basis for why I give it three stars.

It's a tad on the pricey side, but you're paying for the ease of location to the entertainment district and a fairly quiet atmosphere. Solid buffet overall, and it's one I'm happy to visit again."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin, this restaurant was way below my expectations, especially for a place on king street west nevertheless. 

Since it was tiff, most of the \"good\" restaurants were busy except this...wonder why. From the outside it seemed as if it was closed, and since my friend and I were running behind schedule to watch a tiff movie we decided a buffet would be fast and quick! 

The interior of the restaurant was hard to tell because it was so dark! I understand how some restaurants like to try the romantic dim light style and ambience but seriously it was so dark and even flash photography wouldn't work well on food pics. I felt like I was eating at O'Nori! Least there you know what to expect. Even the buffet section was dimly lighted. 

The buffet included some options however most of the food didn't look fresh at all and wasn't even warm. It's like they just left it out from the fried and forgot to turn on the hot plates or whatever. 

Some of the appetizers included salad, pickled vegetables, chat papri, springrolls, potato fries, broccoli pakora, and naan. The main dishes included vegetable biryani, Hakka noodles, rice, chicken with spinach, butter chicken, lamb curry, tandoori chicken, vegetable curry, spinach with planner, and some other random dishes. As for dessert there was only ice cream, kheer, and rash malai. I think they had other stuff but it seriously didn't look appetizing. 

Firstly, I think this place is wayyyyy overpriced for the quality of food they provide. I understand its on King Steet West and all, but other Indian restaurants on the road does not charge that much especially for mediocre food. 

I don't understand why there would be sprinrolls and not samosas at an indian restaurant. just a bit odd. Then the broccoli pakora, didn't have broccoli it seems like spinach light battered and fried. Chat papri was probably the best dish, but like common you can't mess that up. Naan was naan, can't really complain about that. The vegetable biryani was okay, I didn't think it was bad nor was it spicy or too flavourful. The \"hakka noodles\" was basically Mr. Noddles in some curry spices, which was just blah. Vegetable curry was bland, and paneer with spinach, well I honestly could not find any paneer. The most disappointing were the meat dishes, there was barely any meat, the better chicken just was sauce and few pieces of meat, the taste wasn't bad but average compared to butter chicken in other restaurants, the chicken with spinach wasn't good at all, I actually disliked the taste. The tandoori chicken was sooooo dry and not fresh, it looked like it was cooked a while ago! It was hard to chew and had no taste not even salt. Lamb curry dish was the best tasting, however I wish there was more meat in the buffet tray, it was like going fishing for meat within the curry sauce. The dessert was again below par, the kheer was not sweet and tasteless, and the rash malai was better and sweeter. I didn't try the ice cream. 

The good news is, I didn't sick from eating the food! However, its a bit sad that the food quality itself is so bad at this place when it has so much potential. They need to revamp their dishes, add more flavour and spices. Also they need to increase the lighting inside because its very for the eyes to be constantly squinting to see what we are eating. 

I would't bother buying a groupon for this place because its not worth it and please do not ever pay full price, my bill for a crappy buffet came to $24 (without tips)... customer service was good and friendly. Someone kept asking us 4-5 times how we are liking the food, we kept saying it was okay but I hope they read my detail review. Also we were the only two people at the restaurant on a Friday evening at 5:30pm...when we left around 6:30 there were 3-4 more people, which is good but a bit sad. 

I wish I could have personally told the manager how I felt about the food, but since I was running late I wasn't able to! I hope they change up the dishes a bit and maybe I will come back but for now, I still haven't found a great Indian restaurant in downtown Toronto!"}
{"text":"if u follow their review for authentic butter chicken -- they suck it's more like a raabri then main course .. My first time here everything but AUTHENTIC THIS PLA 
CEI IS A NO NO.. And the owner is ready to fight u 'cuz he thinks his food doesn't stink"}
{"text":"Kama is a pretty good pre-symphony dinner option.

Food is fresh, tasty, not overly spicy (unless you put hot sauce on it) and the variety in the buffet is substantial.  Service is attentive, the restaurant and bathrooms are clean.

The staff explained all the food to me as I was serving myself (despite me knowing what everything was) added for some funny exchanges.

I have been to Kama 3 or 4 times and it is consistant;  I will return again."}
{"text":"Judging this on lunch buffet alone, have not and probably will not go back to try the actual menu or dinner (unless it is free).

I almost feel bad slating this place as the owners are brothers from other mothers but one thing I hate is being stuffed with food but being sad about it, afterwards.

Being the only Punjabi guy amongst my friends, they looked at me for approval and I was half way through my first plate when I insulted them all for bringing me here.

Beef curry!?? WTF I mean I eat beef and all, but this is a dish you just out of pure respect for Indian food do not make in an Indian restaurant so I was surprised to see the place full of South Indians and Sri Lankans so maybe they just don't give a shit. Anyway it tasted crap my lamb curry destroys all.

So did just about every other dish on the menu, not one dish had any flavour, some of the dishes were just cold and I gave up after three plates of trying to find something I liked.

Except the mango lassi, that is the bomb gets an extra star and the service and general feel of the place is quite nice. Agree that the buffet section it self leaves something to be desired."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon for two lunches including non alcoholic drinks.  A bit disorganized to check in with host as he was also cashing people out.  We asked if there's mango lessi and they told us they don't make it....for an Indian restaurant?  So we got some soft drinks.  Buffet food selection was a bit sad.  Like 25% of the buffet area actually had food in the warmers.  Very very limited selection of food.  There was salad, a tomato soup, 3 vegetarian options but mostly sauce in the servers, had to dig to find the paneer.  Chickpeas and some other vegetables.  The naan was decent and they had a garlic one available too.  They had a vegetable pasta.  Meat options, curried goat, butter chicken and beef vindaloo.  Nice flavors but I've had better.  Dessert was only some fruit and this \"diabetes in a bite\" fried milk balls.  They charged us a service fee...at a buffet where we got our own meals and servers were hard to flag down for beverages.  I'm not sure if we saved anything really with the Groupon.  I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Bought the groupon for buffet lunch. Food quality was okay- pretty average. I came here on a weekday and it was fairly busy. Honestly, I liked it for the price that I paid with the groupon, but I probably wouldn't come back and pay full price.

They didn't have Gulab Jamun :("}
{"text":"I decided to go to Kama because of a Groupon offer. For $29, you get a dinner buffet for 2 (including beer and naan bread). I did not know that the Groupon would only be valid 24 hours after purchase, I swear I've used it immediately in the past. Luckily, the staff gave me an \"okay\" for this one but told me to not do it again =_=

I'm getting lazy so I'm just gonna talk about everything in one chunk. The food was average at best. They do have some awesome spring rolls and meat but that's about it. I'm a soup kind of person and their tomato soup was horrible. I'm sorry, but why is it so sour? Their dessert was kinda meh. I do have to praise them for having amazing service, I apologize for not remembering our server's name but he was very accommodating. For $15 per person (AYCE format), beer, naan bread (soft and flavourful by the way), and a quiet space, can't complain too much. I felt pretty bad for this restaurant because it was so empty. They really need to improve the variety of their foods, and perhaps look at spicing up their Indian food. I've had way better Indian cuisine and they are all in downtown. It's honestly quite lacking and I wouldn't have come if it wasn't for the Groupon. I wouldn't say I regret stepping into the restaurant because they do have some good points. I always enjoy Indian food and wished that their food was a little hotter. Everything felt mediocre at best."}
{"text":"So good !!!!!  The buffet option is my favourite because I like to try a little of everything.  Wonderful service.  The young men who work are very courteous and sweet, but sometimes forget to refill your drink.  Just kindly remind them and they will get you one.  I've even asked the server to change a static radio station and he did so with a smile.  

The food is great!  Lots of starter options like cooked vegetables, rice, and salads.  They even have a vegetarian section that is delicious.  The meat section is separate from the veggie section which is appreciated by vegetarians :).  Tandoori chicken, butter chicken, lamb, and a seafood blend are in the meat section.  The naan bread is AMAZING, and they have a small bar to order cocktails, wine, or beer.

The place is always busy right from when they open so it is obviously a popular choice by locals.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Another TeamBuy adventure!
We bought 4 vouchers to take my husband's parents to Kama's dinner buffet.
I was excited to try this restaurant because of the good Yelp reviews and I am happy to report that I was not disappointed.

Their decor with its bright yellow, golden and white colors was not quite my thing, but I pretty much loved the rest. 

Service:
Very friendly and attentive without being intrusive.
Our waitress made sure that our water glasses were always filled.
Our used plates were taken care of right away.

Food:
I found that Kama was offering a good variety.
They had several vegetarian options (warm and cold) as well as salad, a few chicken dishes, one lamb dish, one beef dish, two types of naan (garlic and regular), several chutneys and finally a few dessert options (rice pudding, fruit custard and four ice cream flavors).

My favorites were the Chana Masala, the Lamb Chop Masala, the Tandoori Chicken and the Butter Chicken.

Room for improvement:
- The naan was a hit or miss. 
I had a piece that was very good and a couple that were so dry I only ate them because they worked well as a base for the sauces.
- No changing tables in the washrooms. 
(Changing your child squeezed between the sinks is never fun.)"}
{"text":"Went here on a groupon.

Basic Indian buffet, not much choice and did not seem that fresh.

Service was nice but did not appreciate the automatic 20% tip added to the bill
and they calculated the tip against the regular value of the meal, not the groupon.

So we are forced to pay a 20% tip for buffet service for a substandard buffet and the total is inflated as high as possible.

Will not return"}
{"text":"Out of 5
Food: 2   Service: 4   Atmosphere: 4

Came here with friends during lunch for the buffet. The selection wasn't that great. There were about 3-4 vegetarian curries, 3 meat curries (including seafood), and some other little appetizers and salads. 

We were pretty disappointed with the curries because it lacked spices and seasoning, basically bland (this is coming from a group of Chinese women). The butter chicken was more sweet than spicy. It reminded me of the curries I would get from the food court... maybe even slightly worse. 

One of the things that they need to improve on is being more efficient in refilling the trays. Every time I went to get more naan it was always empty, and the butter chicken rarely had any chicken in it. 

and to conclude, my water had 'stuff' in it.
Won't be back that's for sure."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for few months and I met my cousin here over lunch. Being in Canada , I was expecting this to be very authentic north indian food but it was a good north american indian restaurant at best. Nothing wrong here but some one in charge really need to think where do they want to take it.. another american indian restaurant or a mouth watering spicy authentic north indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here with my sister for the dinner buffet using a Groupon. Only with a groupon I would consider going here again. The buffet was really average and didn't have any Samosa or overall enough variety. Probably will not come back.

If in the Yonge and Eglinton area an EXCELLENT Indian restaurant that did offer a groupon is Marigold, it is so delicious and classy. 552 Mt Pleasant Rd."}
{"text":"There are only two types of Indian restaurants.  the hole-in-the-wall-hut or the Palace.  Kama is definitely the latter.  With large tables, pristine table clothes and servers who know how to serve.

The bufet is nothing to love though.
While the service is incredible.  and I MEAN incredible.  The food isn't as good as the Indian restos on Qn Street (Trimurti or Little India).

The only reason why you would go here instead is because they have an all you can eat dinner buffet- whcih is not available at the queen street locations."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, Tasty vegetarian and meat dishes. Selection is somewhat limited but delicious nonetheless. Disappointing desert selections, in fact there we only 3 puddings to choose from and 3 ice cream flavours served the traditional \"Mandarin\" out of the bucket style."}
{"text":"My family and I got into town rather late and hungry.  My kids had never tasted Indian food, or had been to Toronto so they were in a slightly guarded state.  The buffet was barely open, and I went for that.  Everything on the buffet was great, no worries.  My wife and kids ordered from the menu and were pleased as well.

The owners were very gracious and explained everything from the dipping sauces (chutney, mint etc.) to how the chicken was spiced.  It made for a very nice dinner and now my kids can check out some of the awesome O-town Indian cuisine.

They mentioned they had been in business in that store for 25 years and 10 in another neighborhood.   Great relaxing (and filling) experience for us.  Even though it was late they didn't rush us at all.  When we're back in Toronto, we'll be back."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and have tried out most Indian restaurants on this street. My husband and I purchased a lunch groupon and Kama was kind enough to accept our lunch groupon for a dinner deal minus the alcoholic drinks (that were part of the dinner groupon). While the price of the lunch deal was great! ($17) for two, when we went for dinner, we were charged extra for using the lunch groupon as a dinner groupon. When I spoke to the Manager on the phone, he never mentioned this to me and said \"you're more than welcome to use this groupon but you won't get the alcoholic drinks.\" We agreed and were disappointed to have to pay any additional charge once we got there. I would have appreciated if he mentioned this additional charge rather than just slapping it on us. Other than that the food was fine. 

As for the  food, I was happy with the buffet. Nice variety of two kinds of lambs, a rare thing to see Ras malai (dessert) on the buffet which I was absolutely happy with, great garlic naans and butter chicken, not so great papri chaat. The Lamb masala was excellent. Good service and great ambiance! I would say this a great place for big groups:-)"}
{"text":"Indian buffets are usually a major turn-off for me as they tend to end up being a mess of excessively saucy and generally flavorless dishes (in great amounts, of course). As a result, it was with great pleasure that we discovered Kama in Toronto's Entertainment District. Another great Yelp find, of course...

We arrived about 15 minutes after opening time (5:00pm) on a Sunday evening to an empty restaurant. We were seated immediately and given a few papadum to \"tide us over\" as we waited for the actually food to be set up in the buffet area. The host was pleasant if a bit dishonest in saying it would just be \"a few minutes.\" After about 20 minutes of waiting at our table, we were allowed to help ourselves, and it was definitely worth the wait. This was one of the most impressive Indian buffets I could imagine with a solid variety from cold dishes and salads, curries and vegetables, all the way up through (good) meat dishes. Everything was the temperature it should be (hot stuff was hot which is it sometimes not in buffet settings) and there was even some excellent soup in a tureen in the middle of the buffet area. The host even went around with a hot plate of sizzling chicken tikka for everyone to have right at their table. There were also a few very interesting dessert options including Gulab Jamun (fried milk and dough balls) and Ras Malai (a coconut milk curd) which I had never seen before, let alone in a buffet. 

For less than $20 per person, this is a great value and a very pleasant atmosphere at that. The dining area is attractively decorated and bright for a ground-floor location. The servers were attentive and friendly in taking our dishes off the table and giving us new flatware. For tourists like us, it was convenient to a lot of different attractions (and our hotel) which helped as well. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a large, varied and inexpensive meal in Downtown Toronto. Definitely looking forward to returning on future visits!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the better looking and more spacious Indian restaurants in town. We came on a Sunday. Not many customers. This area is business area and tends to be busier during lunch, and Fri/Saturdays.

This place charges a premium. I guess it's due to the large size? They also have performances on Wednesdays and Saturdays which is nice addition. The food is pretty standard stuff. They have your typical naan, butter chicken, tandoori chicken, and all the standard curries. All the food were good, but nothing you can't get elsewhere. It tastes like any other standard Indian buffet. 

I came with a Groupon. The place is worth 3 stars to me, but I deducted another star because the stupid guy said we need to make a reservation. Looks like he was trying to shoe me away so he didn't have to honor the Groupon. When the place is mostly empty, you want me to make a reservation? It didn't say reservation required on the Groupon. This is the kind of thing that damages customer relations. We still got a table in the end but what's said can't be undone. And seriously...it's a buffet. If I don't eat the food, it's going to go bad anyways. It's smarter to honor the Groupon on a slow day like Sunday. 

Personally, this place is too far for me. It's not a place I would go out of the way for. I'd only consider this place again if a) I happened to be in the area, b) it's a day where they have a performance, c) if I crave Indian d) they do Groupon again. Some stars need to align for me to come back. I will always have other options for Indian food."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Saturday. Service was good.  Disappointment on display & selection on buffet"}
{"text":"I came here as part of Dishcrawl and didn't get to sample their entire menu, but what I sampled was quite good.

The Aloo Papri Chaat was like a threesome (of sweet, sour and spicy) happening in your mouth.  The dish was served cold, which threw me off by surprise, but didn't impeded on the yum factor!

Their butter chicken is one of the lightest I have tasted and doesn't leave you feeling like you are 3 months preggers.  The chicken itself was quite tender, and the dish overall is very mild.

The only thing that I thought was bad was their burnt, and bland naan.  It was just plain old naan but reminded me of the non-existence of flavour that one would find in a communion wafer at a Catholic Church.  

I can't wait to come back and try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Dinner buffet is terrific with lots of choices. They have classic meat dishes- tandoori chicken, butter chicken, curry goat and wide variety of veggie dishes plus garlic and plain naan, basmati rice and veggie biryani. Prawn masala was excellent and all the meat dishes were very tender. 
Service is great and attentive. 
Food has been consistent the last 10+ years."}
{"text":"Went their for dinner one night with my gf.

Food was good and our server did a good kob!

It was Wednesday night and they had live Jazz music as well!!

Cool night at King West before Kinky boots!!"}
{"text":"Visiting from the States and saw this deal on Groupon. Overall a very positive experience. You don't usually get great service at a buffet, but our server went above and beyond. I would recommend the lamb chops and the whole black lentils with kidney beans."}
{"text":"on a cold thursday evening, this was our pick for dinner.

we had vindaloo lamb and chicken tikka masala, as well as a fruit and nuts naan. okay the naan was confusing - it was more like a dessert on its own, paired with heavily spiced chicken and lamb.. i was not impressed. both chicken and lamb were very flavorful and very VERY rich in oil/butter. for a small plate of food, i felt so stuffed!

we were also served complementary rice, and enjoyed some jazz music as we ate. the music was good - didn't know thursday nights are jazz nights. 

oh and in the end the server messed up our bill. 

it was okay. i prefer other indian place tho."}
{"text":"Full disclaimer of a Groupon NOW: yep, we were lured in by a deal while pondering what to eat in the area.

To save time on conceiving of a narrative, I'll be lazy and use point form.  Yay!

Buffet quality:  3 / 5
 * Nothing special, with no true highlights and a single low-light in the form of the dry, sat-too-long tandoori chicken.  It's a buffet, however, so I'm rather forgiving.  If any of these items were served as an entree, I'd have been pretty disappointed.  Coming as it did from a warmer, \"a-ok\" is spot on.

Masala Coffee:  2 / 5
 * Good flavour, but the fact it wasn't properly filtered resulted in us chewing our coffee as much as sipping it.  Perhaps I'm wrong and the lack of filtration is intentional to the style... but I've never seen it done that way before or since.

Ambiance: 2 / 5
* Dining area is fine: clean, basic, comfortable, though the basement location results in a lack of natural light.  Unfortunately, the buffet itself is devoid of character and exits to the restrooms, resulting in it feeling both clinical and unsavoury at the same time.  Odd combo.

Service:  1 / 5
* Agh.  Just plain terrible.  Slow with everything, then very rude when we presented our Groupon.  Apparently, we should know to present a Groupon upon entry.  Sorry, but I use such deals to explore new places, and don't want any pre-judgement, positive or negative, to affect the experience.  Anyway, head server (manager?) left in a huff to print off our bill.  We then waited over half an hour for the bill and our masala coffees to arrive.  Spiteful much?  Don't run promotions if you don't enjoy welcoming those who make use of them.

As we were leaving, the head-server/manager/whatever engaged in a yelling match with the only other people in the restaurant: a large family out for some gathering or another.  The yelling was, unfortunately for my curiosity, not done in English.  I'll just assume they kicked the man's dog.  That'd make me angry enough to yell at a paying customer.

Overall:  8 / 20

I'll be kind and upgrade them to 10 / 20 for the generous 2 star rating.  The food wasn't bad, and the service very likely was not indicative of what one should expect at Kama.  Unfortunately, it scared us off and we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect but stopped in for a quick lunch at the buffet. Really really glad I did. Lots of locals there (and lots of natives from India too -- a good sign).

Buffet had a ton of choices and really varied. All were really good. A nd a good value too for lunch.

Furniture is showing its age and they were sometimes a little slow on water, but for those looking for lots of Indian food, this was a really good choice."}
{"text":"Kama lunch or dinner buffet is a great option under a few circumstances;

1. Cheap & cheerful. Excellent unpretentious pre-theatre/symphony option.
2. Newbie to Indian cuisine. Or seasoned, but still like to taste the various dishes in the buffet.
3. Consistently good food. This quality is highly underrated. 
4. Service. Everyone is helpful, informative, attentive.

I come here before every symphony I hear. It fulfills my craving for an Indian fix. Is it the best? Not by a long shot. But it's certainly solid good Indian food. All the dishes are moderately spiced, and I believe this is a smart business decision because most of their clientele are not seeking the traditionally extremely spiced dishes. 

I've never seen it more than 50% full, which is usually a red flag for me, but I'm glad it hasn't deterred me. And I've never experienced 'Delhi Belly' after eating here, like I have at many other Indian establishments in the city (much to my dismay).

Having an Il Fornello above them I'm certain does not help their cause, and Indian is till pretty taboo amongst the suburbian white folks coming into the city for dinner. (Why oh why pick Il Fornello?!)"}
{"text":"Sometimes when I have dinner plans, I take it easy on the snacking during the day.
It was a good thing I did this yesterday because my dinner venue was changed at the last minute...to an All-You-Can-Eat Buffet!  

Self-serve buffets aren't for everyone. I admit, I'm not one of those people. 
Last night an old friend and I met at Kama, an Indian place in Toronto's Theatre District. She and I have been many times and the place never fails to satisfy.
We met there just before 6pm, and the place was empty. (More naan bread for us, yay!)  But by the time we had sat down to our (ahem) second plate, most of the tables were occupied...our guess was the theatre crowd grabbing a bite before the shows started at 7:30 or 8pm. 

What do I say? It was an extravaganza of all you can eat Chicken (and Fish) Tikka, Butter Chicken, Channa Masala, Saag Paneer (my personal favourite), plus salads, rice, desserts, naan bread and many other delicacies that are Indian-based and catered to our North American palate. (We all know this to be the truth) 

The food is good.  I know that it's hard to make a dish perfectly when you are making mass quantities of it. And yes, plate presentation doesn't even exist when you are scooping food onto your own plate and in a queue full of people. The wait staff, while busy, were pleasant and always had water available when your glass was running low. The place is clean, big and from what I observed, very popular with locals, tourists and theatre-goers alike. 

My only comment would be that they didn't have Gulab Jammun for dessert.  I was really looking forward to some of that. Also, they served Naan bread when you asked, as opposed to their lunch buffet, when you can take much more than you probably needed. (Well, maybe that's a good thing) 

I like this place. I've been going for years and I'm always happy when I leave. I can say from experience that it's a great place for lunch, it's family-friendly and you will enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"I came here for the dinner buffet with my family not too long ago, and it was fantastic! Just what I expect from an old school North Indian buffet. Everything looked made to order, creamy and extremely flavourful, and the taste did nothing to change my mind. 

The service was also very efficient and hospitable. The waiter returned frequently taking requests, filling glasses with water and what have you. 

I truly appreciated watching the management patiently explain dishes and clarifying doubts to Indian food n00bs. Kama's decor is elegant, and the ambiance is just right for families, dates and business lunches. 

I will return."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this place at all. I only came because I had a Groupon. It's pretty expensive for what it is: mediocre food and selection. There was nothing that wowed me or made me want to eat there again. It was also very empty on an evening at dinner which is always worrisome."}
{"text":"I have tried many Indian restaurants and this is one the best I have tried. Especially their dinner buffet is amazing. I always come here when in town, I bring all my friends and they love it too.
I strongly suggest. Their butter chicken is amazing. They also have delicious mango ice cream and good cocktails for ladies."}
{"text":"Service was alittle slow but I had the butter chicken and samosa's which were very good :)"}
{"text":"Came here recently for the lunch buffet. Had a nice experience. The food was pretty good and the selection was decent. Wish they had more ice creams rather than just vanilla. They should have chocolate and strawberry, they had space for them but none present. The service was excellent and atomsphere was very nice and cozy. Buffet is priced higher than others around the area at $14.50 vs. $12.99 at Dhaba and Aroma. Worth checking out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I went here solely because I had bought Groupons and it looked like a pretty good deal...$17 for two lunch buffets + two drinks on a weekend! This is a huge restaurant. They have an endless line of tables. I wonder if they ever get full. The decor is nice and it works as a family restaurant. We went on a Saturday afternoon. They had just started the buffet so the food was warm. They had tomato soup which was good. I didn't take too much of it since I didn't want to fill myself up. They had a decent variety of vegetarian and meat curries. No seafood though unlike Trimurti (my current favourite buffet in Toronto). Their tandoori chicken was dry...butter chicken was good but that is a dish which is hard to screw up. They had some beef curry..tasted like the other curries. The food didn't seem that fresh and felt like it was leftover food which was just re-heated.They didn't have biryani for the buffet...just plain jeera rice. The vegetarian options were decent. They used a dew non-traditional veggies like zuchinni but I guess they need to improvise in this country. Overall, the food was not authentic at all (trust me on this since I lived in India for almost 22 years), it was very westernized...and I am not taking about the spice level. The dessert was the standard fruits, ice cream, gulab jamun and kheer...nothing to take home on that. Definitely not worth the full price of $14...go to Queen west instead."}
{"text":"I got the dinner Groupon. I think we paid $15 in total, including tax (not tip). For a dinner buffet, that's a good price, but I wouldn't pay full price for the dinner buffet here. 

There wasn't much of a variety, as a buffet. The meat that they had was basically stew, so much sauce and you had to look and scrape around to find some meat. If you're a vegetarian, definitely don't bother with this place. The vegetarian selection were spring rolls, rice and one entrée, I don't remember the dish, but you'd basically be better off paying for a vegetarian plate somewhere else. 

I thought it was cool that they had a band perform live, but I kinda felt sorry for them because there were only a few people that were in the restaurant. If anything, people were mostly at the bar. 

If you got the Groupon, cool. Other than that, I don't recommend this place. They food tasted fine and the service was ok, but for the cost that you're spending, you're better of going somewhere else."}
{"text":"I remember this place from a visit in 2011 and I remember the food being great.  Now it is just average.  For $22 per person the buffet is not cheap.  They have three stations: salads, vegetarian and meat.  There aren't too many items in each.  You won't go hungry - what's there is enough, but don't expect a huge variety. 

The butter chicken was overly sweet.  The fish curry was very good.  I liked their garlic naan (not all you can eat).  That's pretty much it.  The rest was unremarkable. The place is large and never full.  Service is good."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my friends. Tremendous variety on the buffet, all really fresh, hot, and delicious. Options aplenty for vegetarians. The naan is as good as any Indian place you'll find. The waiters are really welcoming and friendly, never rushing you out. Though this place is a bit hidden on King, it is a gem nonetheless. Definitely give it a shot."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend decided to come here for lunch because we found a groupon that made it pretty cheap to eat at ($17 for 2 people + 2 drinks) - which didn't end up being so cheap (will explain later on). 

We didn't come in with high expectations since it's a buffet. But for the curries with meat in there, there's basically just bone and the meat had fallen into the sauce somewhere. It was very hard to fish out the meat in any of the curries. Of all the indian buffet restaurants I've been to, this is the first time I've encountered this. The paneer dish had very little paneer in there and a lot of peas. Again, had to spend a few minutes to fish paneer out. Tomato soup was also not very good. It had a slight metallic taste to it (like it rubbed off from the pot) and also an unpleasant spiciness to it. It was also interesting they had spring rolls and hakka style stir fried noodles in the buffet. Lastly, there was no icecream. The freezer was broken and there was a note saying that they are looking to replace it soon. The final disappointment was the bill. They tacked on a mandatory 15% tips regardless of the service received (we didn't get much service except for the one time she finally refilled out water). With the mandatory tips and tax added, the total ends up being only a few dollars shy of the regularly buffet price for 2 people (which was higher than its competitors down the street). All in all, don't get tricked into buying their groupon thinking you're getting a great deal!"}
{"text":"Attended their $11.95 lunch buffet with a group this afternoon.  Very nice offerings with an especially tender beef curry.  Vegetarian stuff was tasty too, especially the vegetable fritters and the pakoras.  Service was a little forgetful and disorganized, but pleasant.  Would go back."}
{"text":"All day buffet.

Located right in Dt.

Also they deliver too."}
{"text":"It was okay but not memorable.

Staff: Definitely felt like they were disorganized but friendly. I did not know it was a buffet style and it wasn't even explained as such. Normally, it is explained about the cost, etc. and if there is an a la carte menu, they should provide that as well. There wasn't a drink placard on our table, so when they asked us what drink we'd like, I didn't even know what was available until I asked for a menu. They also cleared the buffet plates infrequently. However, once we get their attention, they are very quick.

Ambience: It is a large space and it was very quiet but then again there was only 4 tables.

Food: There isn't a huge selection of food but I will say that the butter chicken was delicious. I liked their naan as well. However, nothing was extraordinary.

I kind of wish I was given the option of an a la carte menu. A decent buffet option but I probably wouldn't seek it out."}
{"text":"I'm Indian, y'all. Trust me.

I came here for a weekday lunch buffet and was rather pleased. They had a good variety of items to suit different dietary needs - lamb, tandoori chicken, butter chicken, raita, tomato soup, fried zucchini, etc. I was avoiding gluten when I came here, but I had a lot of choices. Their saag paneer is second to none... and I've had a lot of saag paneer in my day!

Service was friendly and laid back. Lunch was $17 after tax and tip, which is pretty standard for the King Street strip. I dig this joint!"}
{"text":"Please choose another restaurant... for any south Asian will never like it... for the money paid and the number of items is not worth... just 1 or 2 dishes taste somewhat nice... non veg a big no no..."}
{"text":"Okay, sure, it's all you can eat Indian.  I'm past the point in my life where I'm like a John Pinette bit when I go to a buffet.  I'll pace myself, and within half an hour I'll have eaten my full, but not gorged myself. 

So Kama is good enough that I don't have to depend on shovelling plateful after plateful of food down my gullet to compensate for it. 

It's well located, and you'll get a good amount of food out of it.  There's foods to serve every palate, too."}
{"text":"I had eaten here a couple of years ago and enjoyed the experience. However when I visited recently I was really disappointed - the buffet selection had shrunk, the cutlery looked like it could do with a good scrubbing, the food itself was nothing to write home about and they have switched from white tablecloths to brown oilcloth. Will not be going here again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to this place for lunch. I had a Groupon for their buffet lunch for two people with two drinks. I have to say the Groupon was a great deal. The service at this place was very good. The seating was comfortable. For my drink, I ordered a masala chai tea. I thought the tea was ok, but I didn't really taste the flavours of the spices that was supposed to be in the tea. The food in the buffet, was satisfactory as I have had other Indian food that was much better. Overall I like this place, the food was satisfactory the seating was comfortable and the service was very good."}
{"text":"From the start, I would have given Kama a 4 stars because the food selection and the quality was good, but the service (or lack thereof) sort of killed my vibe. 

My friend and I went on a Tuesday evening for their buffet. 

The place was not full, nor empty either. 

DECOR 

The place is in a basement and it feels like it. A bit difficult to find the entrance, and once you get inside, it's dark and you come across these massive couches in the middle of the dinning room, next to a jazz scene. 

FOOD 

Good selection, you find all the classic dishes and they bring you naan (classic or garlic) directly to your table. The food was very hot, it didn't appeared to be there for hours and tasted good. 

SERVICE 

You could tell the staff was not sufficient. I saw only 3 people running the dinning room and terrace, + they had to help refurbish the buffet and prepare drinks at the bar. The lady was very nice but the two other guys just seem like they couldn't care less. 

We had to ask 2 times to get some naan and waited 10 minutes for our bill. We then waited another 15 minutes for someone to come and take the payment. Slightly fed up, we went to the bar to pay and had to wait another 5 minutes. 

I hope they would get more people on the floor to provide a better experience. 

Overall, a good filling meal for less than 20$ (including tip)"}
{"text":"After trying out some other Indian restaurants in the area, I have to say that Kama is still my favorite Indian restaurant in Toronto, however I can no longer give five stars.
The food as always is really good and flavorful, however every time I come here the place is almost deserted - completely empty. I am not sure why, maybe because Kama's lunch buffet is $2 more expensive than other Indian lunch buffets or maybe it's the area.. can't tell. Also, the food here is more spicy than in some other Indian restaurants around and some of the dishes looked very oily. On my last visit here, we were the only customers in the restaurant; it seemed kind of awkward. Also, some of the dishes were lukewarm, almost cold, some of the dishes were almost empty. I still like the food here, the table seating arrangements, authentic style, the service is very friendly and good, nothing to complaint about. I just wish they invested more money in marketing; this place is amazing. I love that they bring you hot and fresh naan at the table once you arrive. Another great thing about Kama is that the actual buffet is located away from the tables, and the space around it is pretty big. No need to bump into someone's table while filling up your plate. They also have great dessert selection - Rice Kheer, Mango Kheer, Rasmalai, Gulab Jamun - depending on the day. But they always have kheers, ice cream and fresh fruit (melons, grapes etc)."}
{"text":"I've been to Kama maybe at least 4 times for the lunch buffet. Twice I came with a groupon, and I think the groupon is a good value for what you get. On top of the 17 dollars for two, they have tax and a tip included on your bill. So it comes out to 27 dollars in the end for two people to have all you can eat Indian, and two non alcoholic drinks, which isn't bad!

The first time I went with a groupon, we weren't even offered drinks though... So I was pleasantly surprised the second time when we were. Overall the service the second time, on Oct 27th 2013, was actually quite good and well worth the tip.

Another time I've been here for the takeout option. For 10 dollars you can fill up a takeout container from the buffet line, and I think that's a great deal. I would totally recommend doing that if you work in the area.

I'd be tempted to give it 4 stars. But in the past I did have questionable service, though I think they may have corrected that now with new staff. As well, it is not the best Indian food I've ever had, but it's also not too bad either. I'd say the lunch buffet is worth it, though I dunno about dinner."}
{"text":"It's not the best Indian food place in Toronto but it's good. The buffet is 8/10

Don't go there for the atmosphere, go there to slip into some food coma after. The servers were helpful.

Skip the vegetarian options (unless vegan/veg) go straight for the lamb chops, butter chicken and biryani.

Get the mint chutney with everything. 

Skip the samosas, the weird chowmein dish and fries (not sure who thought of that)

Get some garlic nan bread. 

Finish off with some Ras Milai and maybe a gulab jaman if you have room.

Don't make big plans after this meal. IT. WILL. MAKE. YOU. DIZZY. 

Don't go here if you are counting calories."}
{"text":"Food quality has really declined over the years.  Shame since we are moving back into the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Went here with a groupon for lunch. Generally attentive staff. However, once a big group came in we weren't paid attention to. The food was alright, nothing special. The groupon was two lunch buffets for adults, and two non alcoholic beverages. We weren't offered the drinks until we specifically asked for them. After the large group entered, we had to wait twenty minutes after asking for the bill to receive it. The last thing that annoyed me was the compulsory 15% tip. I tip according to the service received,  and $6 for two people wasn't reasonable. The food itself was decent, but after everything, it was nearly $30 for two people. It's normally $10 for a good Indian buffet, so I'm not going to return."}
{"text":"Kama, you ain't no goddess of love. Your buffett is a sloppy, unholy mess. Never again in your shrine will I set foot, no matter how starched your table cloth is or how twinkling your lights are.

Chicken rafts bobbing aimlessly in an atlantic ocean of butter chicken curry...sad looking veggies... out of a box desserts that are cloyingly sweet...sinewy tandoori chicken... very, very sad looking chafing dishes... appearances matter, so keep them up.

The servers are very good tho. Kudos!

Kama is a flighty temptress, so be warned!"}
{"text":"I like the ambiance of the restaurant, they have live music during dinner time. I have been to this place twice first time a la cart and second time buffet and here are my findings:

A la cart:
1) the best option if you're going to dine at this venu; food is fresh and hot.
2) the best items are lamb biryani and butter chicken.

Buffet:
Skip it all together because curries were liquidly displayed and there was always shortage of naans!"}
{"text":"1 star :  for  very friendly service; everyone was happy to be working there

1star : for okay food

Dessert at the buffet; awful. Especially when indian cuisine is so colourful and rich. Disappointed. 

But not  that disappointed; i knew what i was walking into when i opened the door.

Cheap + convenient, below average, nothing special, can cook better at home, indian edibles."}
{"text":"Visited Kama based on location and reviews while visiting Canada. Good Indian dinner buffet. Range of choices to serve different palatial needs. Blend of vegetarian, chicken goat and fish dishes.  Some dishes the heavy cream was overpowering the traditional indian flavors. Loved their butter chicken and the gulab jamun desserts. Found toronto indian restaurants( the ones i visited) were great (Best indian food outside india ( after brick lane restaurants in London)."}
{"text":"Middle Eastern friend took me here with a group. Everyone liked the place. The service was fast and friendly (Except for the fact the got angry about the groupon usage so be sure to book it in advance before using. Other than that the staff was great and the food was varied and plentiful which is all you can really ask for at a buffet. Will have to try this place again sometime."}
{"text":"Great Indian buffett.  I've been here twice, and I loved it both times.  Both times the place was quite empty, and I'm not sure why.

The place is big, could be a far walk to the buffett depending on where you're seated, but that's not a concern for me.  The quality of food is top-notch.  I loved it and highly recommend it.

{"text":"Service was excellent, server was attentive and charming. Food was decent but somewhat bland, at least for what I expected, I prefer more ginger and chili in my Indian food and I mostly tasted garlic and onion (it tasted a bit white to me)."}
{"text":"This used to be a great place to eat. I hadn't been there in about 2 years, and I'm sad to say that I noticed the quality of food had dramatically gone down.... Such a shame... I could probably do a better job at home...."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, since it's so walking-distance close to one of the TIFF film screening venues (Roy Thompson Hall).

Husband and I were prepared for a-la-carte, but then were informed that the dinner buffet was available.  Hmm... Buffet = Faster meal service, greater food choices, incl. dessert and soup, too??  Ok!

Actual service was pretty good, though I did have to ask to have some water refilled.  

Loved: their muttar paneer (on the sweet, not savoury side) + rice, and their wide selection.  There was some simple but nice dhal soup.

~~~
Overall, the food was ok and better than elsewhere in some instances.

I recently bought two two TeamBuy coupons there ($15 for $30 worth of grub).  The dinner buffets are about $21~ per person.

I'd like to redeem the next one during a weekend? lunchtime buffet.

Would I go w/out a coupon again?
Maybe.  I would have to be in the mood for it, and my fave. place for an Indian buffet is *still* Biryani House on Wellesley st.  Their pappadums aren't too oily, they are just right, and their selection and quality is splendid and satisfying."}
