{"text":"Very friendly, clean, cozy. Parking very limited but worth the search. Large portions of excellent food. Waitress is very good, made some fine recommendations."}
{"text":"Finally a brunch place with the \"hole in the wall' feel. If you roll out of bed a minute late don't bother coming. Regulars fill the seats at Molly Brown's Cafe like it's apart of their religion. I've never seen such great service in a local restaurant before. All of the servers were working together topping off coffee, taking orders, and passing by with a smile.   I was over the moon to find out they make everything fresh and by scratch everyday. Yes that means the hash browns are cut from a real potato every morning. Processed crap that comes in a 5 pound bucket isn't to be found in the kitchen. I wish they would advertise that...huge local selling point.  If you've been to the Molly Brown's in Ellet and it drove you in the wrong direction you need to visit Molly Brown's on State Road. From what I was told the owner is new and from the Akron Azteca family. Time to set my alarm so I can beat the regulars!"}
{"text":"Just had the best breakfast I've ever had anywhere! Not kidding the best! I had the southern Shrimp and git's.  If you love this southern classic stop looking it's here!  Service was spectacular and friendly. Amazing find for this Louisiana man in the cold."}
{"text":"You get a lot of food, good well cooked food, for the price. Decor isn't amazing. But the food is so good. I've never really thought breakfast at  restaurant was a good deal. You can make most of that stuff yourself for like 5 bucks. But not this. This is legit."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on Saturday morning.  Lots of variety on the menu. I got the garden omelet, grits, and banana bread. My associate got garden inlets with olives no broccoli, rye toast and cottage cheese. We both enjoyed. Generous portion.   Omelet was big and very good. Done well. Grits were kinda bland, and the banana bread was moist.   Our server was nice. Looks like lots of regulars go there. Had a good bfast. I'd be willing to go back for another try or lunch.   The only down side is that the interior it is kinda dank. Not dirty but not decorated nice or really appealing. Again. Didn't seem dirty just an old room that was bland and dank."}
{"text":"Just moved to the Falls and was looking for a good non chain breakfast place. Stumbled into Molly's and now I've been there 3 times. Portions are plentiful, taste and service is always great and prices are very fair. The only negative is that parking is tricky at busy times."}
{"text":"The portions are good for the price and the wait staff was great. However the food quality just wasn't great. I ordered a Belgian waffle and it was rather hard and chewy. I'll probably go back next time I want a cheap breakfast and try something different."}
{"text":"I've always like Molly Brown's the prices what got me good food great staff but ate there today and I noticed with no warning that the prices went up sad to say they outpriced themselves and I'll probably never go there again to eat"}
{"text":"New location the setting us cozy. Reminds me of a old main st diner in any small town. The service was fast and friendly. I had the omelette with ham and cheese , it was very good my daughter had the French toast she rates it 4 out of 5 stars. Overall enjoyed my first visit here. I will be back."}
{"text":"When I'm hungry and want a good breakfastbin Cuyahoga Falls I stop here. The  staff is warm and friendly, the food good and plentiful, and the price is right."}
{"text":"This is my first trip to akron after living in ohio for 17 years. I wanted to go to McDonald's for breakfast but my wife suggested i try something new. So i yelped for breakfast restaurants and ended here. Its a nice local diner with a bunch of locals eating there. I couldn't help but notice the servers called them by name. But, i digress. The food was great. I chose the Molly Omelette and was stuffed half way through. The portion sizes are huge and my coffee cup was always being filled. The entire staff were super sweet and i have no problem recommending this place. As a side note, next time i think ill try the butter fingers pancakes."}
{"text":"I'll have to admit that Molly Brown's was my fourth choice for a breakfast place this morning, but I'm real happy I ended up there. From the name I expected generic breakfast dishes, hopefully cooked well, but Molly Brown's takes a different angle on breakfast, with a lot of Mexican influence, and this made it a lot more interesting.   I had the OMG Breakfast Sandwich special, and the name fits. The omelet in the sandwich was full of good stuff like chorizo, bacon, and red onions, but the standout feature was the bolillo, a kind of Mexican baguette. It was toasted and perfect, with a nice crust outside and soft inside. They have their breads made for them and brought in, so they are using real Mexican-style bread. If you want a regular US breakfast you can get that too, but if you want some extra zing you will have a lot of choices here.   The service was friendly and helpful. I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Excellent service, friendly staff. I got the Louisiana Skillet. It was cooked perfectly, tasted fresh and arrived at my table piping hot. Portion was too large for me to finish, and was priced under $10. All that and my coffee cup never went dry!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast on Sunday with 6 and got sat pretty quickly despite a full house. Service was polite and food came out quickly as ordered. I got the Paul Bunyan and it was really good, but super filling.  Everyone was satisfied with their food, even heard compliments from other people around us. Saw a lady get a giant cinnamon roll which was pretty neat and she seemed satisfied.  I paid for 2 other people in my party (Division 1 linemen) asides from myself (not small by any means) and only paid $34 for a pretty solid amount of food.   Probably won't be a regular but I'll definitely go back again one day since my buddy lives around the corner from it."}
{"text":"Average food, average service, average price.  This is your typical southern-style breakfast caf√©. Good portions on their plates, but not much flavor. For a breakfast place with a obvious southern-style twist on it, you would expect to have some spicy pops of flavor, or some seasoning for that matter, but no, not really. Be prepared to drench your food in the hot sauce on the table for some kick in your food. The food was not bad by any means, it was prepared just how we had asked, but simply just..simple. You expect something different than what you actual get there."}
{"text":"After months of wanting to go here, I finally sat down and tried the food and it did NOT disappoint. If you are familiar with the Valley Cafe, I'd say the selection is comparable but a lot tastier and the seating arrangement/interior style is similarly homey.  The gravy is done right, it's delicious and NOT spicy, which is what I wanted. Their biscuits are cooked to perfection. I got the country chicken skillet and the chicken fried chicken was possibly the best I ever had! The staff if SO friendly and it's the kind of place where you can strike up a conversation with strangers because it attracts that kind of clientele. I'm glad I came here and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Very professional and friendly staff.  Basically breakfast food is what I get so hard to mess up but they do have a few nice twist on breakfast food items.  Order the right things and definitely will fill ya."}
{"text":"Unassuming diner but the food speaks volumes. The smothered spuds are my favorite:  fried potatoes, bacon, sausage, eggs all smothered in the best gravy ever! The servers act like they own the place & care about everything from the cleanliness to the customer's day!"}
{"text":"Kinda torn here. The wife got a veggie omelet which she enjoyed quite a bit. Service was good As were the prices.  Beverages were refreshed often, and when asked about my liver and onions,   Genuine concern followed my comment that it might be a tad overdone. It was, but it hadn't made that nasty transformation to shoe-leather, so it still fell into the consumable column. The gravy which was served in a small bowl was confusing.  It tasted like the bland fresh-from-a-can variety, but was lumpy. I couldn't tell if it was flavorless but homemade, or canned and scraped from the coagulated leavings at the bottom of the steam-table bin. But I suspect the latter as the lumps gave way when consumed without the chewy little starch nuggets found in the real thing The green beans were good, there was ample liver and it was generously dressed with 3 full bacon strips, and served with a generous square of cornbread so all-in-all still a thumbs up experience!"}
{"text":"This is the best place ever for good food. We are here every week, sometimes more than once, because the food is delicious and the service is wonderful! Prices are good, you feel like family when you walk in and if your day is going less than well, I promise you'll leave with a smile!"}
{"text":"Easy to get seated, great menu selection. I always get veggie omelette with egg whites. Excellent. Fresh fruit and veggie (even avocados). Quick in and out! To boot great pricing. Going for breakfast today!"}
