{"text":"I've been to other Shoeless Joe's locations before and had good service.  However that was not the case at this location.  Our waitress, an older blonde woman, came to get our drink order immediately after we were seated--we said we needed a minute to decide, but she left us for about 10 minutes...the place was absolutely dead so I have no idea what she was doing all that time.  We finally got to order our drinks and food, the food came out and she never came to check up on us...we were planning on ordering more beers but by that time we were there for more than an hour because she took so long.  I was afraid of ordering more because it would take another 30 min to come out. This place is a joke.  AND they don't serve lattice fries anymore...that is the only reason I wanted to go there!!"}
{"text":"I went to see game 7 of the world series after calling to find out if Joe's would be showing it. When I arrived, it was on a small screen while hockey was on the big screen. The chicken wings were average and the service was average. There are many other better pubs in the Oakville-Mississauga area."}

{"text":"I came out here for a friend's birthday/UFC event. Our large group had reservations and got the royal treatment. They gave us a corner of the restaurant where we had our own private large booth and table with a TV. We could also see the larger screen over the bar. The cool thing about this bar, reservations or not, is that no matter where you sit, you will have a good view of whatever sporting event is on. TVs everywhere.  The food was actually pretty good as well. I had the Sophia burger with a sweet potato poutine (not on the menu, but I asked, and the chef provided!). I was in heaven. We never had to hunt anyone down to get a refill on drinks, and the server was around enough to take our ever growing alcoholic drink orders quite regularly (even though the place was rammed).  Overall, we had a really good time. It is definitely a good place for group events."}
