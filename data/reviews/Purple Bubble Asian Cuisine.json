{"text":"Disappointed. My boyfriend and I went there and ordered 2 drinks. Waited...and waited...and waited. I got my drink but my boyfriend still hadn't gotten his. We continue to wait. Then we see that the people who were behind us had received their drinks and food before us! We wait for 20 minutes for a drink that takes less than 1 minute to make. When asked about this, they said sorry and shrugged their shoulders. It's a place run by teenage kids with little to no customer service experience. There are some workers who are better and faster than others but really unimpressed with today's shit show... there was only 1 customer before me and it wasn't busy so really not sure why it was such a mess. Doubt we'll go back and if we do, it won't be when today's staff is working!"}
{"text":"The hot milk tea is really good here. I got the roasted oolong tea with almond flavouring and it was dynamite. The cold bubble tea/slushies are about average compared to other places. The food is good, but takes a long time to prepare. I would come back for the hot milk tea."}
{"text":"I am a regular at this place. I absolutely love bubble tea and Asian cuisine, and I was thrilled to hear that a bubble tea place finally opened up in the Durham Region. I'd love to give this place a perfect score, but if I was being honest, it would only be because it's the only place dedicated to bubble tea and eats this far east. The drinks satisfy any bubble tea cravings you may have. They are pretty good, but sometimes a little on the sweet side. Nothing to set them apart from other tea shops, but yummy nonetheless. The staff is extremely friendly, attentive, and helpful. This place is still fairly new and (I believe) independently owned, so I think they are still getting into the rhythm of things, but I'm really enjoying it so far. I'm sure they are continuing to make improvements (which I've already seen in terms of their menu selection since they opened). I will still be coming back to this place both for the drinks and food. I do hope they try to put out desserts, though. Nothing goes better with bubble tea than a green tea cheesecake, am I right??"}
{"text":"Prompt and friendly service.  The kids really liked the grilled pork with rice.  The pho soup was really good too.  The bubble tea and lychee slush were a hit with the kids.  They invited their friends to come.  We liked the atmosphere.  It was welcoming and fun.  We will definitely be regular customers."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Always different employees when I order. Two female employees always seem miserable and depressed. I have ordered with an egg well done with my food before a couple times but comes a little runny. Wait time is unbearable. DO NOT order food or drinks here."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Never had to wait for a single drink the time I waited at this place.. Plus, the staff is extremely unfriendy.. Never going back !"}
{"text":"We had the Nutella bubble tea. It was really really good! not too sweet, just perfect. My only issue is the price. I spent nearly$7 for a large tea. it's a small and clean establishment. I haven't tried the food but the plates I saw people eating looked good."}
{"text":"Awful... bubble tea was horrible. Ordered this week's special which was orange chicken and it was uber sweet and I only got chicken with zero steamed rice...    I was annoyed but still eager to try the chicken.  It sucked!  Will not be returning. Sor"}
{"text":"Nice self service place, food court style. Clean and brightly lit. We ordered Pho (standard quality), Satay chicken (not authentic Thai/Malay)but tasty all the same. The Pad Thai again was not at all authentic but the dish was still tasty."}
{"text":"I stopped in here as I was craving a Bubble Tea and it was the only place I could find nearby that sold them.  I ordered an Original Mill Tea with Tapicoa and it was - okay. The drink was cold with just the right amount of ice but I felt like there was not that much tapioca and I paid for extra! The sweetness level was low and the drink overall was sort of bland.  Nothing like a ShareTea or a Chattime. They also served food which people seemed to be enjoying in the little restaurant but for sure their strength is not Bubble Tea. It's more of a little restaurant that can make Bubble Tea if you order it - just not the greatest I've had."}
{"text":"Since moving to Ajax last year, my hubby and I are always looking for a good, new place to eat! Came here for dinner, we got the shrimp & pork spring rolls, the rice and chicken platter, and the rice and beef platter. The food was very tasty! The prices are super reasonable. The gentleman that was serving us, who I presume to be the owner, even brought us two bowls of soup and a sample of their new yogurt bubble tea flavour. The strawberry yogurt bubble tea was delicious! The service we received here was exceptional. We would highly recommend and will definitely return soon!"}
{"text":"This place has bad service, and bad food. I've been there a couple times when it opened and it was much better. The honey garlic chicken was way too sweet, and their chicken pho had a large layer of oil on the top, I could not eat it... The chicken smelt weird so I did not try it. They have a clueless teenager working in the front, and would not even help him when he was clearly struggling. With so many Asian restaurants in Durham, they need to step up their game! Will not go back."}
{"text":"It's so nice to have a good bubble tea place in Ajax! Came from Markham where every corner had bubble tea, so it was great to have a place so close. What's also nice about this place is they serve quick meals and also Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai takeout. Classic dishes that were made fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, nice space and reasonable prices. Oh and free wifi."}
{"text":"Went there with family. Great bubble tea and excellent food.  Everything was very tasty and service was quick."}
{"text":"Found this place quite by accident and happy to see another choice for Pho in Ajax. It was between 12 noon and 1pm and there was not another soul in the place.  I understand Purple Bubble has been open for 2 months.  There are a few tables, but I'm guessing their business is mostly takeout.  Ordered Shrimp Summer Rolls and Classic Pho to go.  Shrimp in rolls did not smell fresh. I only ate one roll and saved the other for next day, which did not do the shrimp any good. Rolls come in one piece (not cut in half which would be usual) and tend to fall apart if you are not careful.  There was little depth of flavour to the Pho broth, which was disappointing. When one orders pho to go, the noodles, and meat are always on the side as are the bean sprouts and basil, with the broth separate, for mixing just before serving; this gives an opportunity to heat the broth first if you can, and not have the meat overcooked. This was the first time I have ever ordered takeout Pho where all of the meat had already been cooked.  There is a small covered \"steam table\" with about 8 different dishes available with combo options of 1 main, 1 side, or 1 main and 2 sides. \"Mains\" are noodles or rice.  Not sure I would return as I feel there are much better Pho options available in Ajax and Pickering: Red Kitchen, Pho Metro, and Pho Saigon.  Staff were very nice and accommodating, asking what sauces I wanted with the rolls and whether I wanted the bean sprouts (for the Pho) cooked (no!) and if I wanted basil (always!)"}
{"text":"Dropped in to pick up a quick lunch and got their spicy basil chicken with rice, spicy level-5 chilies.  Although the stir fry was flavourful with better than expected \"Thai\" flavour, the 5 chilies spicy level was nowhere near spicy.  Large portions with choke full of veggies, chickens sitting on rice made for a good lunch.  Just wish they could have made it spicier as 5 chilies is their maximum spice level.    May come back to try their Hong Kong style egg waffles with my daughter if we're back in the area for a shopping trip."}
{"text":"Service was  quick, staff was friendly food is decent but not awesome. Prices are fair, I've had better bubble tea but it's the only place in Ajax that has quick serve bubble tea...so they kinda have the market cornered on this one. If you go in stick to the Vietnamese selection of food everything else just isn't that good."}
{"text":"Dropped in because I was craving some bubble tea. Tried the mango, no sugar with tapioca and overall it was good however felt there was not enough tapioca. Chatime are pretty generous with tapioca compared to this place. I had their food a while ago and remember it was good as well. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"great service and quality food!!!  i love the bubble tea especially since they allow me to order ones with no sugar...  i can tell they use fresh ingredients like the beef and broccoli is amazing and the vegetable spring rolls are once of the best ones i have tried"}
{"text":"Love their Bubble teas!! We have had a few things on the menu and have never been disappointed. One our favourite stops for fast food. The only negative I can say is This place is usually busy around dinner time so you might wait a little longer than you expected. Otherwise, love it."}
{"text":"Cute little place in Ajax. I only went in for the bubble tea and was not disappointed. The bubble tea was delicious and the tapioca was on point. The service was a little bit slow but in their defence it was dinner time and they had a lot of big orders for bubble tea. The guy at cash was a little bit slow but he was very attentive and courteous. The only reason that I didn't give this please five stars is because they were using just one blender and I noticed they didn't wash or rinse the blender before or after they made my drink. I'll definitely go back again for the bubble tea and maybe try their food."}
