{"text":"We've some stuff on the menu - burgers, a wrap, onion rings, fries, etc- and it was all fairly mediorce, but reasonably priced at around 7-8 bucks for dinner.  

But hey - the hot wings here are amazing.  No complaints.  They're perfect.  ORDER THE WINGS!!!"}
{"text":"Came here late, late night. Loud and dark. I didn't get a drink (as I did not need ANYmore), but it seemed like a cool atmosphere. Younger, a little hip."}
{"text":"If you can't find a sandwich here, then you don't need a sandwich.  They offer a wide variety including hot sandwiches, wraps and burgers.  The special pulled pork sandwich was tender and served with slaw, which is a must for anyone who knows about pulled pork sandwiches.  We were there for lunch and the server was very attentive and generous with the soda refills.  The \"Georgia Reuben\" was a tasty, lighter version of the  reuben with smoked turkey and coleslaw substituting for the pastrami and sauerkraut.  The \"Rob 'N' Steph's Veggie Melt\" was a good vegetarian choice, and has left this diner with the much needed energy to finish the day."}
{"text":"Argus is where it's at! 

They're menu is never-ending, with a wide variety of vegetarian options to choose from.

Exceptionally friendly interaction between the employees and their patrons. Argus has a sort of Cheers feel to it. They could use a bit more space to accommodate such a fantastic crowd of people, though."}
{"text":"We went for drinks recently after a conference and had a very unsatisfactory experience. We came in around 1:15 am and each ordered a beer. Around 1:30 am, the bartender Ryan became incredibly rude. He announced last call, and then mere minutes later, started yelling loudly that the bar was closing and everyone needed to leave so he could clean up.  We had each only ordered one beer, and yet barely had any time to drink them. More than fifteen minutes before scheduled closing time, he came by our table and very rudely snatched away all of our glasses, including a 3/4 full pint my friend was still drinking.  If they were planning to close early, he should have forewarned us when we first ordered drinks.  There is no excuse to be so rude to patrons who are just quietly sitting there consuming drinks.   We all agreed it was the worst treatment any of us had experienced at a bar anywhere in recent memory."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would! I used to work here during college (old owners) and it was great! I revisited this past week and the place has turned in to a LGBT bar. Not that I mind but the bartender that evening was more interested in his friends then newcomers coming in and spoiling his evening. We had a large group that was going to come over and join us approximately 20 people, we asked if we could 20 shots for $100 (that would be $5.00 a piece) and the bartender said no!!! WTF! This man-child shouldn't be in the customer service industry and is a disgrace to the LGBT community! All of my gay friend are the sweetest ever... this person was not....."}
{"text":"I have come here plenty of times now and always have a great experience!  It doesn't matter who is working the staff is always very nice and polite.  Today I ordered cheese curds, which I get every time because they are amazing, and a BLT even though it wasn't on the menu they said they could make it for me. Came out looking better than ever!"}
{"text":"We're always taken care of when we go here.  Burgers are good, the fish-fry is so so, and the drinks are nice and stiff.  The downstairs dungeon thing is perplexing, but adds character."}
{"text":"The Sandwiches are very reasonably priced and decent. Certainly not amazing, but I was not displeased when I left. The chips that come with the sandwiches, though, are clearly normal potato chips from a bag, so next time I'll opt for the fries instead.

The beer list is pretty good and reasonably priced, and the atmosphere is cozy. I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed this bar for years. The staff is friendly and the outdoor sitting area makes a great summer day of drinking. Plus I've never had a bad meal from there, love those sexy fries."}
{"text":"Its a great place to spend the afternoon for a drink and lunch on the patio. The inside of the building is also very historic.  

I would highly recommend the jalapeno cheese curds.  I think they are super delicious. They are not too hot and come with a yummy ranch dip. 

I also love the wrap I believe is called RC's Identity Crisis!  Its a buffalo chicken wrap with bacon, bleu cheese (I love bleu cheese). 

Every time I have been here the wait staff has been very friendly and quick to help us out.

They have quite a large menu which I don't think is overpriced. 

I'll be back."}
{"text":"LOTS OF VEGETARIAN BAR FOOD!!!!

Nice place to hang out w/ a large group.  Food is good, not awesome.  Service is pretty good.  Decent drinks ($5).  Good beers.  A little overpriced, but overall you will have a good time with many coworkers or friends.  Good place to watch a game, but they are not open on Sundays.

The veggie ruben is my personal fav although a close second is the California fiesta."}
{"text":"This is city bar with patio seating, it's not very big but does have good tap beers. We sat on the patio seating like everyone else was doing. They have food service to the patio as well with the spirits. People were having the food but we had drinks. The service was slightly slow because they were trying to work the inside and out but she kept up. It was a nice casual place to sit out. Side on a nice day and relax. The street was king of noisy but that was to be expected. This seems like a neighborhood because every one sitting there was bumping into people they know and talking. Staff was friendly and pleasant. This looks like a nice hang out place. I would go back again."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for dinner on the patio one evening because they had a pretty good beer selection and decent sized menu. We had the Mediterranean appetizer which was delicious, but definitely could have come with more pita bread. I ordered the mushroom and swiss burger with \"sexy fries\" on the side and my husband got a salad. The burger was cooked exactly the way I ordered it, and those fries were addicting. 

Our server was super nice and helpful. She seemed to know the menu pretty well. The decor in the bar area could use some sprucing up, but it matches almost any other bar in the downtown area. The clientele inside was pretty rowdy and loud, and it was kind of obnoxious to be eating around a bunch of people smoking on the patio, but we decided to go with the latter. Overall it was a decent experience and we may find ourselves wandering in again sometime soon."}
{"text":"I'm new to area always looking for new places to eat. Ok so I picked this place on the hot guy review lol. So not disappointed, food is fantastic, love people watching while I get my grub on. I went with classic sandwich, next time I'll try the salad."}
{"text":"So only came here for drinks, but I love the sports bar kind of feel here. TVs playing everywhere, good music playing in the background, nice traditional half rectangle bar that was pretty filled, awesome beer section.  I ended up getting a draft cider boys. yumm! 

The bar is kinda small, but the way they arranged everything makes it look really open and very inviting. Staff was great, greeting you from behind the bar, and thanking us for coming in when we left. Great customer service, which to me makes or breaks a great experience. 

After reading the reviews for this place, pretty excited to try this place out for a late lunch, or dinner sometime. Seems like a solid place, with good drinks, and great staff!"}
{"text":"Great place for food and service industry crowds. A place to check out in Madison for sure."}
{"text":"I can see what other reviewers mean by dive bar. I stopped by & took a look at their menu, deciding to opt for the patio area instead of inside. Based on other places that have outdoor seating, they typically ask you to come inside where then someone will guide you to your table with a menu in hand. Not this place. A few customers and staff behind the bar were yukking it big time and didn't acknowledge my presence in any way. Okay, so I stepped back outside and asked another table what the procedure was. They told me to just snag a table outside and someone would be with me. Sure enough in about 10 minutes I got waited on. The outdoor smoking is somewhat annoying but understandable. The sandwich I got was good at the right price and the right size. Some places give you so much food that you have to fool with a box full of leftovers. Service was not bad at all. I doubt very much I would eat inside but on a pleasant day the outside is very nice."}
{"text":"I saw the employees call the cops on a homeless black man for daring to walk back and forth on the public sidewalk outside the business (I mention his race because we ALL know how dangerous it is for black people when interacting with police, especially those with mental illnesses, such as this man visibly has). He'd been harassed by patrons on the patio of one of the other bars and had become pretty agitated, but wasn't hurting anyone or doing anything dangerous. He was just pacing back and forth. A man was following him from about a foot behind telling him over and over that he had to leave, which was obviously and unnecessarily making the poor guy more upset. 

A woman who had been sitting at Argus' patio gave him a cigarette and he calmed down considerably but the employees continued to attempt to have him removed from the area. By the time the police actually got there, he was quietly leaning against a lamp post doing NOTHING. When he was treated with kindness and humanity and spoken to in a reasonable way he calmed down. Shocking! 

I live about a five minute walk from this place so I go all the time, but I won't be returning after this experience. I don't support unnecessary antagonization of the homeless. They are people and residents of the city who are allowed to occupy public spaces. I also don't support calling the police when a simple conversation can resolve the problem. No one was in danger. No laws were even being broken. These cops did not escalate the situation, but they could have and things could have taken a terrible turn."}
{"text":"For years I have wanted to come to your bar and check it out. A bunch for my friends got together last night and decided to check out a new bar location, which was yours. As you know, there is plenty of others places in Madison we could have taken our business. After getting severed with our first drinks and having a great time, what happened next was very disappointing. Your staff decided to totally ignore my group of friends (15 thirsty drinkers) and not provide service. We were not intoxicate (I only had one drink). After 20-30 minutes of waiting patiently for service, we left for a bar that would provide service. Myself and majority of my friends are from the hospitality industry and we would never treat customers in this fashion. The bar was not busy or under staff.

Sincerely, one very disappointed customer."}
{"text":"While in town recently, I met up with my cousin for a morning of farmers market shopping and lunch. We chose Argus cause it was close to our cars (meter feeding in Madison is quite painful!) 

Argus was not much to look at but their menu sure is! A full page of hot sandwiches, cold ones and wraps too. Not to mention their salads and apps. Everything looked great and the names were the best. 

I decided to try the veggie Reuben and my cousin got the cheese steak sandwich and a bloody. Both sandwiches exceeded bar food expectation and the creativity in creating a veggie friendly rueben, blew. My. Mind. Plus, the potato chips were legit homemade and you can see the lines of the potato as it was being cut. 

Also, shout out to the bartender/server working this past Saturday. She was flying solo on the floor and got slammed with a rush. She handled it with ease and skill. We may have been a little late feeding the evil meters but she rocked that rush! You go girl!"}
{"text":"Perfectly located up on the capitol square, where else, other than Wisconsin can you get a grilled cheese, ham and cheese sandwich? Perfect spot to go drinking during your lunch hour with the friendliest bartender around. And where else can you get your lunch hour Strong Man Competition fix?"}
{"text":"This is a great bar. People are great here, very eclectic crowd. The interior is beautiful. Very chill atmosphere. I travel here for business a ton and this is my go to spot to unwind."}
{"text":"The location right up by the capital is great, they usually have somewhere to sit, and the owner is always there and seems to remember people and what they drink- definitely a unique atmosphere compared to most of the bars in this area.  Food is mediocre, but cheap, so I never feel particularly good or bad about eating here...this is a great back-up bar, at the very least, but also certainly an easy place to become a regular at...which is always a nice assurance."}
{"text":"The waitress was a little surly, but other than that this place is great.  Nice atmosphere, good location, great beer selection and wonderful food.  I had the Barbara's Garden sandwich which was delicious.  I am a huge fan of avocado on a veggie melt.  My friends got the patty melt and the pesto chicken sandwich and they both raved.  Go for the fries."}
{"text":"The Argus is \"my\" bar.  They have a great happy hour.  I love their vegetarian sandwiches (separate section on the menu), and they make great long islands.  The cheese curds are pretty good, too.  The lady who (I think?) owns the bar with her husband is awesome.  She remembers your drink, remembers which sandwiches you like, and always makes you feel welcome.  I hang out on their patio and read with drinks and dinner in the summer, and I spent election night there."}
{"text":"Went here to drink and play Scrabble. Very stiff double jack & coke so woohoo! Got my buddy drunk for the first time in his life!"}
{"text":"Dive bar atmosphere inside but they have an outdoor patio area for the summer months. It was super crowded in here and loud, so not my favorite scene since they didn't have that many beers on tap. However, everyone here seemed nice, you just have to flag a bartender down if you want service quickly. Very relaxed overall atmosphere, but I probably wouldn't come back just based on the more limited beer selection. Parking wasn't too difficult to find on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Consistently one of the best bars in Madison.  Strong drinks, good food, great owner."}
{"text":"The Argus and I have a relationship. I worked at La Mestiza (which has since closed) next door for a few months while in Madison. I was originally drawn to the Argus by the very handsome man who works there named Davin. (He is still there, go visit him!) 

The offer live music, pool tables and great food. 

The best sandwich in Wisconsin exists here: The LGBTA

Lettuce, gouda, bacon, tomato and avocado. And you get fries...but not just any fries, sexy fries. Reasonably priced, clean and always friendly, the Argus is one of the best casual restaurants to go to in Madison,"}
{"text":"I once hit three bulls eyes (one a double) at this bar.  It therefore comes highly recommended."}
{"text":"Downstairs has a great venue for bands, it's kinda hidden away.

Little pricy for the average ambience they offer."}
{"text":"I love the Argus! It's a small bar with super friendly staff and excellent food! They also have an awesome outdoor patio."}
{"text":"I keep waffling between three stars and four on this one. On a good night, I really like Argus. It's generally not too crowded, prices are average, and on warm nights they have one of the more comfortable options for seating. The music is usually pretty good, and at the very least it's interesting - not a lot of Top 40 or classic rock. 

Some nights though, the lack of a crowd works against the atmosphere, and the food (in my limited experience) was fine but nothing stellar despite their large menu. It could have been an off night, and maybe my particular sandwich isn't indicative of their other offerings. 

I always enjoy Argus, but there's not anything that's yet to tip the scales permanently from \"A-OK\" to \"Yay!\"."}
{"text":"Dude.

Why didn't anyone ever tell me that the downstairs turns into a BUMPIN nightclub on the weekends? While it's a little dungeon-y, it makes for a hilarious mosh pit of action and grooving. Their was a great combination of above 40's and college frat bros that somehow managed to work. The bar upstairs was being flogged, but the downstairs one was manageable and I snagged a Ballistic for a reasonable $3.75. The whole scene was hilarious; I recommend it if you're up for a night of raging."}
{"text":"Argus is right off the Capitol square, which is convenient for some people. They have happy hour from 4-7 ($1 off taps, rail drinks and wines, I think). They also have some tasty buffalo wings and a host of delicious sounding sandwiches and burgers with clever/punny names. I split an order of wings and the LBGTA (Lettuce, bacon, gorgonzola, tomato, avocado) sandwich with my boyfriend, and they were gone rather quickly. The fries are thick cut and salted just right. Yeah, I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"The Argus Bar is a place which most Madison residents know about, many have visited, and and a lesser number have (at one time or another) made it their regular go-to among the myriad of downtown bars on the Isthmus.  The Argus has been around for over two decades, and has changed relatively little in that time.  It's vibe can change dramatically, depending on the time of day, type of demographic inside, and other factors which are less predictable.  Think of it as the bar version of that person you used to date who had many mercurial moods, but always wore the same clothes.  Lunch may be the most benign time there, when laconic patrons and downtown employees take advantage of the wide variation of menu and drink choices.  What to order off the menu could occupy a review in itself, but suffice it to say that there are rewards and choices which are problematic.  On a recent visit, I was a little short of cash and thought a humble burger would be a good compromise at $5.75.  While a 1/3 lb. patty is the standard offering, and lettuce, tomato and slivers of red onion, along with condiments are served without additional charge, the final result is about as inspired as retired CPA.  Other more successful offerings include their Reuben, different salads, wraps, and decent chicken sandwiches.  Drink menu is complete and the pours are healthy.  For proof, just check the clientele at closing time on the weekends, when the place becomes a loud and unapologetic hot mess for young people to either celebrate their tinder conquests or just get hammered like a good Wisconsin citizen.  Regardless of your take on the place, it will likely be here longer than you."}
{"text":"Burgers are on the better side of ok.  The other things I've had, since it changed hands a few years ago, have been on the lesser side of ok.  If you're craving a burger, it's a fairly inexpensive place to go, but there's better places around to get a burger from, within a block.  It's just a couple doors down from my boyfriend's house, and has later hours than many nearby restaurants."}
{"text":"One of Madison's best, most consistent least appreciated Downtown bars. Right off the Capital Square but well above the pricier spots that serve up less value than true substance.  Great food good service and authentic Wisconsin hospitality."}
{"text":"The argus has great happy hour drink specials dollar off taps and 1.50 PBRs. The bartenders and waitresses are all pretty friendly. I haven't had a ton of food items from Argus but the ones I have had are good."}
{"text":"Argus is a tiny bar/restaurant just right off of Capitol Square with a classic bar ambience and dim lighting. The place itself is not bad if you're looking for a chill bar to unwind at, but the food on the other hand is...not the best. I got the Angus burger with fries, and while the fries were fine, the burger was a little below average. I'm not sure I would recommend getting food from here if you're looking for a real dinner. Overall, it's not a bad bar though! Just don't expect restaurant quality food."}
{"text":"I had the usual 5-8 happy binge+hoot with close friends. Had a really good time. Nice casual bar with a friendly bar tender (thanks for putting up with us).

Pretty good bar snacks (still prefer the Plaza). We ordered the classics: wings, fried curds, french fries, and onion rings. Thought the dice's french fries are far better than Argus'.

So why the 3 stars? Because I got the hangover the next morning. This doesn't usually happen to me at other places - what were they pouring in my glass? and I consider myself as a pro on binge."}
{"text":"I don't think people rush to Argus to eat salad, but I do. 
Three times this month in fact. 
There's just something about blackened chicken on a bed of greens that gets this guy going. But they have 153 sandwiches if that's more your thing. Ok... maybe not THAT many, but I'm always surprised when I pick up their menu after a while and see the plethora of burgers, sandwiches, wraps and yup, salads. And now that Main street is open again, it's quite lovely to score seats on the patio and watch the cast of characters drift by."}
{"text":"Argus is a fun, tasty and reliable lunch choice on the Capitol square. Especially if you are with a crowd because Argus has something for everyone, including vegetarians and the gluten free. 

But the main reason I love Argus is because ordering can make you feel just a little dirty, as in \"I'll have Dick Frank's super sub and the lady will have Barbara's Garden.\" Add a side of sexy fries to the order and you get the feeling that this might just turn into a long lunch. Nooner, anyone?"}
{"text":"Stopped in after work on a Saturday. It was busy busy! My friend and I got onion rings and burgers... I asked for mine rare and they made it so. The two bartenders were running smoothly, delivering food and drinks to bar and tables alike. This place has a kind of exciting vibe, and I should stop in more often. I am not a vegan, but they do have a Mediterranean appetizer plate, which is meat and dairy free. Great selection of taps, and reasonable prices, too. Check it out, y'all."}
{"text":"I went here for their open mic, and discovered their sandwich menu. If the comedy sucks, go upstairs and sit at the bar- then order any sandwich off their menu. Add a spotted cow, a shot of whiskey, and VIOLA! Night saved. 

Perfectly toasted french bun, melted cheese, avocado, portabello mushroom, onions, and chipotle sauce. If you like meat, there's options. 

Bartender is perfectly friendly. 

One of the few things I liked about being in Wisconsin was this bar."}
{"text":"Slow bartenders over priced and watch out for the regulars they are rude and have free range at this place."}
{"text":"Eh. Not impressed. There's a lady who works there with crazy eyebrows, she was not too friendly towards me. She ignores me when I tried to get her attention. It wasn't even that busy that day either! Other than that, it was ok"}
{"text":"Came in with my boyfriend on a Saturday night, they were playing great music.. this will definitely be our new spot if the music is consistent! We love old school hip hop and we came in at the right time!!"}
