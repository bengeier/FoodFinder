{"text":"Really decent jerk chicken.  Came here during lunch hour, only $7 taxes in!  Nothing fancy about the interior of this establishment and the majority of the customers in line when I went there were Jamaican.  Staff is friendly, typically when I go to a Jamaican joint they talk to me like they're pissed off that I am ordering from them lol, so I was pleasantly surprised.    The chicken is not dry nor is it overly moist.  I'd say it's cooked just right with the flavor smoked into the meat.  The flavor on the skin is not overly salty nor is it bland, with no particular spice overpowering the 'jerk' taste.  I'd give the chicken and recipe 7.5-10.      What surprised me the most of about this restaurant was the cole slaw.  Not a fan of cole slaw as I find most places either make it too creamy. bland or too sweet.  The slaw is bang on here as it compliments as opposed to overwhelm your palate when eating with the rice and chicken.  Very well done.       Will be back."}
{"text":"Super busy inside when I went (and there were some kinda rude customers- butting in line, interrupting other customers while they ordered etc might've just been the time of night-- but again that's not anyone's fault) Staff were lovely, though!  They were outta oxtail, much to my sadness, but ended up getting jerk chicken. It was pretty damn good , not the best not the world, but I'd order it again. Portion size was huge!! Lots of chicken, seriously enough to feed me, and my three kids!! I got oxtail gravy on my rice, of course, it was suuuper good! I will definitely be back to try their oxtail!"}
{"text":"Jamaica House is a reliable chain (well, they have another location across town on Pertosa). When they're really on, they're on - and you can get some of the best takeout Jamaican in the city. They're also are a jack of all trades, as all their dishes are reliable - and their soups are terrific. Every now and then an order comes a bit below expectations; not poor or anything, but just not to the level they reach other times.  Great place though that I'd recommend without reservation, and they have a large menu too."}
{"text":"I'm always skeptical getting oxtail from anywhere because I always compare it to my moms. This place has the best oxtail I've ever had. The price is a someone expensive $13 for a smal, but besides that it is the best you can buy in my books."}
{"text":"Some of the best takeout jerk you will find in this town. The service is quite good, fast, and polite. I am writing this review, while having the last few morsels of the 1 pound of the jerk pork that was supposed to last me until tomorrow. It lasted one meal. My diet for today is nonexistent. So delicious. Spicy! As it should be. An proper.   I have no qualms about heading back there tomorrow for more. The rice and beans quite good along with the oxtail gravy."}
{"text":"This place has the best jerk chicken and curry goat I have ever tasted, did I forget to mention the soup! none of these other Jamaican restaurants compare, I'm very picky when it comes to eating from Jamaican restaurants because in the past I've wasted a lot of money but every dollar I spend here is worth it. I'm happy my mother in law introduced me to this place since I've started eating here I wouldn't go anywhere else at least in Brampton but I highly recommend this place to everybody!"}
