{"text":"My husband and I used to love to go here and dance but recently it is the same songs over, and over, and over again.  Please get new bands, DJ's, and new songs!!!"}
{"text":"Linden Grove is a fun place to go with friends or even alone, everyone seems to be really nice. I always have a good time, although I think they need to change things up. Every Saturday same music don't get me wrong the music is good,but it would be nice for a Saturdays 80's night or Disco Saturday night. Friends of mine came in from out of town I took them there they liked it also.They do need to expand the dance floor is to small for the crowd they get. Stop in sometime you will enjoy it also,but hope for a 80s night that would be great"}
{"text":"Great food, great people! Great atmosphere!   Such a fun time & no drama.   Would definitely recommend for a date night, or even just a spot to stop for a drink or 2 with friends!"}
{"text":"This is a great place the food is excellent the ages /crowd is a mixed crowd and the dance floor is always packed!!!! This is a must try for a good night out great people great food and DJ Tim pushing out the 80s, 90s, and top 40 on Saturday night!!! Make sure you ask for Rose she is an amazing lady and will take great care of you!!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a 40+ bar/nightclub. Early in the night it's quiet and you feel awkward dancing, but as the night progresses so does the crowd and the music! Friday night is usually a band (sometimes really good ones like Totally 80's) and Saturday night they have a DJ and play some great old school music videos. Some of the drinks are very watered down but I found the tequila sunrise and I'm sticking to it!"}
{"text":"Had my 21st Birthday here and loved it! Great food and music! My favorite sandwich there is \"The Godfather\"! Definitely going there again!"}
{"text":"We went to the Linden Grove to hear a band called Totally 80's. (I highly recommend them). We went early to have dinner. The restaurant itself needs some major updating. There are stars in the ceiling. There are colorful lamps but some were burned out. There is a brass railing all around the dance floor. The entrance is awkward. It was pretty safe to say that we weren't expecting much from the food. We were a little surprised.  I ordered a GodFather which is like a baked Italian Hoagie only it has fries and coleslaw on top. I removed the top bun because it was burnt around the edges a bit much for me.  I actually tackled this sandwich with a fork and knife. It was huge. I ended up giving half to a friend of mine and I still felt like I had a mountain of sandwich in front of me. The coleslaw was good. The sandwich actually benefitted from the acidity. The deli meats were good and the fries were hand cut. I think I would have preferred it the sandwich had not been baked but that is my personal opinion.  My husband had the fish dinner. It came with veggies and a choice of starch. The piece of fish almost covered half of the plate. It was broiled nicely. The fish was very flaky and tasty. The veggies were a bit mushy for my taste. I'm not a big rice fan so I didn't try it.  As I said earlier, we were a bit surprised by the food-pleasantly thankfully."}
{"text":"Fun local spot for dancing to songs you love but hadn't gotten to dance to since Pittsburgh had an amazing dance club scene way back. DJ Tim plays favorite songs from the early 2000's shuffles to current hits like Bruno Mars. Saturday evenings, no cover charge, reasonably priced drinks. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The Grove has the nicest people they became family go there every single weekend great food Great music great for a night of dancing always dancing the night away go there for karaoke on Thursday nights. The food is awesome the servers are all my favorite they're awesome DJ Tim is awesome all the bands are really good only have the best bands there. The bartenders there make great drinks."}
