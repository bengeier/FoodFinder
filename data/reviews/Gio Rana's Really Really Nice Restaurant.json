{"text":"Crespelle stuffed with mushrooms were excellent but everything else was a bit average given the price.  Interesting decor...mannequin in the roof room was a bit creepy though."}
{"text":"This is one of my stand by favourites and what good, rustic Italian food should be. My favourites are the meatball app (just one giant yummy meatball), the roast breast of chicken, involtini, or slow cooked ossobuco. Mains come alone, veg sides come on a communal plate that is shared. Food is small plates Italian style. There is a good wine and cocktail slection. My only caution is that the place is loud, and always have a reservation. Book the wine/bank vault for larger groups for special occasions, reserve four weeks ahead for that."}
{"text":"I LOVE the nose.  This is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. I had my birthday dinner with a close group of friends in the back bank wine cellar vault.  It is nice to be away from the noise and to eat amongst all the wine!

i have been to this restaurant several times, but this is my first review.  The service is always impeccable.   the food always top notch and the new menu is great!  We always had the duck, but our new favourite is a beef-pork dish.  The new menu is amazing for those of us with Gluten Allergies that don't think we can eat at said restaurants where pasta lives.  They are wonderfully open to ensure that I receive a meal that is healthy both for my stomach and the gut!

Ah, always a fan of this restaurant for nights when you dont' feel like cooking to days when you need to celebrate birth, life and love.


My birthday event was lovely.  My friends had created a lovely dessert for me because I dont' like and can't eat many desserts.  It was a flower arrangment made out of fruit.   it was awesome to see the staff cut up the watermelon at the end of the night because we were en route to dance th enight away.   It just seems like such a great team.   

Service from the owner to busperson is always great.

if you haven't tried this place, it is a MUST!  

*gluten in the meatball, *flour in all cheese sauce.  They will put it on the side."}
{"text":"If heaven had a restaurant, it would be called Gio Rana's.  This is quite possibly my favourite restaurant of all time. It is always an experience when you dine here.  The staff are very knowledgeable and friendly.  You will not be disappointed dining here."}
{"text":"This is a 0/5 rating.

The staff are inattentive and pretentious. We were greeted by waiter Y, he took our order and spent the entire night at a couple's table while waiter A brought us our food, drinks, and dessert and checked up on us once. Waiter Y only returned to collect the bill/his tip.

The food was incredibly disappointing.
Meatball app = 1/5, pre-made
Gnocchi = 0/5, bland and cold
Risotto = 0/5, unappetizing as it was a dark brown, no taste, and it was already separating as it arrived, pre-made
Chicken Breast = 1/5

The food/service resonates with the theme/decor of their restaurant - incomplete, half-a**, and 'meh'.

Save your money, time, and the disappointment and go to any other Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"How is it possible that a restaurant can keep exceeding my expectations every time?

We went with a huge group on Saturday night and it was fab! I love that the hosts at the door are always very happy to see you. 

The food is delicious!! The menu  has their the old Gio's favourites like the huge meatball (that my friend Jane dreams about) the grilled calamari (that I dream out). The specials are usually planned and thought out, oh and delicious!! 

The servers are after my own heart: not snobby, very attentive, knowledgeable and take demanding foodie friends in stride. Water always full or decanter on the table - check, side plates for appetizers - check, new cutlery after the appetizer - check!

It might be worth noting that they have expanded the restaurant. There used to be an Autoshop next door that they now use for large parties. I was loud and fun! 

**the only time that you will pay 'through the nose' is if you don't watch how many bottle of wine are flying around**"}
{"text":"I echo previous reviewers.  Went there last night for the first time.  Ambiance was great, service was wonderful and the food was excellent.  I had the very large Meatball with Ragu Sauce and my wife had the Salmon.  Both were excellent.  The Cappuccinos were among the best I have ever tasted.  All in all - highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance. Better than average cuisine, nicely presented, but not overly special. Great service. Overall experience is good."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to Gio Rana's Really Really Nice Restaurant (aka: the nose) for a long time now and finally made it tonight.

It didn't disappoint. I started with my classic 'lychee martini' I have this everywhere I go :P and then followed up with one of their fun cocktails (sexy mofo). Drinks were pretty good. 

The food was great! They have a fantastically tasty selection of 'contourni' or side dishes. My favs were the green beans with mint and garlic and the asparagus with gorgonzola. The rapini with garlic and lemon is worth ordering too. 

For my main, I had the garlic shrimp with crispy parmesan risotto cake - it was really flavorful but my only complaint was that the portion was pretty small (as is the case in many places when you order shrimp as a main dish).  There were lots of other things on the menu at looked good so i will definitely go back and try them. 

For desert I had the chocolate raspberry tartufo which was one of the best I've ever had. 

I've read some of the other review and many people say they had bad service but our service was really good. Our waitress was attentive, friendly and spent a fair but if time talking to us after we paid.

Overall, costs were mid range but worth it from my perspective. Two of us ate for about $50 each which included a couple of drinks, sides, main dishes and desert."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go to for a taste of \"nona's cooking\" as my friend would say. The food has a that authentic home cooked meal feel to it, with all the dishes having a no fuss, hearty goodness taste. The pastas that we've had there are cooked amazingly well and full of flavour, but again not fancy with unnecessary ingredients. 
Their mealball is amazing, as are the seared scallops and every meat dish we've had there is great. 
The ambiance and servers make the place great. it's casual and fun but still a nice night out. The servers are attentive and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Top notch restaurant. *Really really* authentic italian food.
Going from the decor to the waiters to the food, everything during our visit was great.

Food:
The giant meatball they serve here is as good as previous reviews said. 
Osso bucco is absolutely delicious.
We also ordered roasted garlic potatoes and their brussel sprouts/pancetta salad, both really yummy.
To end our evening, couldn't be any other way: Tiramisu. It was one of the best I've had in Toronto.

Definitely a place we'll be visiting again."}
{"text":"Everyone I talked to in Toronto seems to know and love this place.  Maybe I didn't order the right thing, but I thought it was just okay.  Fun place; it was packed, with loud music, nice looking people, friendly staff, everyone seemed to be having a good time.  I wasn't terribly hungry so I got the prosciutto and melon.  Now, this should be a simple, classic dish, not hard to execute properly.  The prosciutto and the melon get equal billing in the title; I like nice slices of cantaloupe accented with the ham.  But, no, not on the plate here; the starring role was given over to a generous serving of prosciutto, while a few little chunks of cantaloupe made but a cameo appearance.  Topped off by a suprise (and unwelcome) appearance by some balsamic vinegar.  I will give it another go next time I'm in town, but this did not augur well."}
{"text":"Pricing is average for the area and meal, and the meals are very well done, so a great value. Service is fast, friendly, and professional."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place! I really did! Lots of awesome reviews! Offbeat name! Giant nose! What's not to love? - I thought... I brought a visitor here after they flew into town, expecting to blow some socks off. Unfortunately the socks remained firmly on. That said - we enjoyed ourselves. I enjoyed my giant meatball appetizer, but the calamari were bland and nothing great. Upon quizzing, my fiance couldn't even remember what he had. My visitor and I very much enjoyed the freshly made butternut squash crespelle, which was a delicate and delicious dish... and we did get a good recommendation on wine! However, our service wasn't amazing overall,  and we also had a giant screen in the room playing some kind of movie which we thought was a major distraction. I have to wonder if this place has become overhyped.... yarg!"}
{"text":"I have to say this place has great food, service, atmosphere and pricing! Really a great place for a date or a nice catch-up with good friends.  A+ from me!"}
{"text":"Went here for a dinner with a big group. Firstly they don't do split bills making it so much more difficult for us considering we had 17+ people. The music was also very loud making it hard to talk and hear each other. 

The food was good, but the portions were very very small considering the price of each dish. The service wasn't too friendly either, but maybe that had to do with the auto gratuity ensuring her tip. I would say this place has good food, but just overpriced. Also the women's washroom smells funny like medicine or something."}
{"text":"This place is always a hit for my husband and I. Very consistent so you know what to expect. The meatball and arancini as appetizers are amazing followed by the beef involtini for your meal. Perfection!"}
{"text":"Both the food and ambience left a memorable experience, which is why I am reviewing this place.

Very cosy environment for dinner.   We came with a big group but it is suitable for dinner dates too.

Definitely want to come back and try other items in menu.   

The meatball and Brussel sprout slaw were quite memorable."}
{"text":"I was searching the net looking for a great place to take a date, and yelp delivered.  This is a great place.

You walk up to the building which used to be an old bank that I can only assume was built in the 70s, so it has that bland styling.  There is a solitary large nose on the front facade.  I love that kind of playful quirkiness. You walk inside to find a beautiful and gorgeous place.  It's warm and inviting and bit rough around the edges which only adds to the casual feeling.  It feels like a place where you can have fun with friends, or a bit of romance.  It's not stuck up or pretentious at all.

The food was excellent.  We had some mozzarella with pesto and tomatoes, which was superb.  I woudln't be able to pronounce it's proper name, even if I tried.

I had the chicken breast with cheese and garlic, again superb.  I wouldn't sing it's praises from the mountain tops.  But it hit all of the right buttons of my taste buds.

Desert.  Tiramisu.  You can't go wrong with that.  It was great.

I only had a few minor gripes about the place:

1)We went on a quiet Sunday night, and the place wasn't busy.  Our servers seemed a bit to anxious to help us.  They came around a few too many times which disturbed the date a bit.  But in no way were we rushed. I'd rather have them coming around too often as opposed to too little.  They were very helpful when I asked if there was anything fun in the neighbour hood to do for after dinner.

2)In the bathroom the urinal is way to close to the faucet

3)We were seated right against a heater.  Which got me rather hot.

Again, these gripes are minor things.  When you add up everything this place has going for it.  I don't really enjoy a place that is too polished.  Where it feels like you need to dress exceptionally well for the restaraunt.  This place is relaxed and fun, with good food.  Nice art on the walls.  It doesn't take itself too seriously."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, service, and atmosphere. But the music was so loud that it diminished the overall experience"}
{"text":"Summary, delightful dance-club beat combined with some inventive flair executed pretty well. Some mistakes but enthusiastically corrected by the staff.

Came in on a crowded Saturday night. Was able to work me in 35 minutes at the bar. Probably would have been only 25-30 minutes if I wanted a table. Staff did a good job of making sure I wasn't lost in the crush at the door.

Entry is next to the DJ booth. Internal doors look blocked until you realize you aren't supposed to go through the double doors, instead go into the entrance on the door to the left after you go through the main doors under the 4' paper-mache nose and nothing else. Took me a moment to figure it out and I saw several patrons struggle with it. It looks like you are going in the wrong way and there is some other entrance you are missing. Follow the nose and the arrow and you'll be okay.

Decor is kind of interesting: downscale unpainted walls, odd entrance under a 4' paper-mache nose with no other signage, some interesting paintings organized in clumps, obligatory characitures of famous past patrons above the exit and nice chandeliers hang from maroon-tiled ceilings. A telling combination of kruft, tack and inspired decor.

At the bar, the bartender nudged me to a delightful Shiraz (Six Rows '09 from Australia). Went for the crostini special, a special humis, garlic with prosciutto with a dark drizzle reduction of some kind (guessed hoison but could have been something else) on a toasted focaccia. Anyway, special was a joy. The pork tenderloin was a bit over cooked and dry but the bar tender returned it without question, doing a better job on the second try, doing justice to the red wine, onion reduction and they made amends with an complementary helping of a very special brussel-sprout slaw (shredded salad with feta, pine-nuts and bacon to great affect) and an extra glass of the 3-rows. The spinach salad was also a delight  and, with the amenity at the bar, shared a wonderful tasting of scallops. Dessert was an acceptable Tiramisu and 
cappuccino. 

Summary, favorite dishes was the crustini and the inventive brussel-sprout slaw with acknowledgements to the spinach salad. The atmosphere of a dance-club sound-track hightened the conversational din of the place. A semi-casual atmosphere, great energy, proactive staff and fun surprises on the menu made friends of us strangers at the bar. Good times and enjoyable meal. This patron will return.

{"text":"This place is pretty fun. If you go earlier in the evening, it makes for a more, um, peaceful dining experience, but even after it's packed with patrons, both the food and atmosphere are great. 

Try the salmon. It's like making love to Zeus: all lightning bolts in your mouth and stuff."}
{"text":"I had an amazing dinner experience at the Nose.  It's got spectacular service, great ambiance, a hip and trendy clientele and some truly incredible gastronomic delights.

I started my meal with a snifter of excellent port, and the gorgonzola-stuffed fig with prosciutto, which was divine!  My entree was the delightful peppered halibut and shrimp cartoccio, the fish was flaky and moist and with just the right amount of pepper, tomatoes and onions.   It was sublime.

It's easy to mistake the decor for laziness, but a lot of work (and not a lot of money) went into making this hipster dive gourmand house.  Saving money where prudent and spending it on the kitchen and top-notch ingredients is what makes good food. The proof is in the pudding, when you walk in to Gio's it exudes a sense of hip-apathy, while still being inviting and cozy.

The service was excellent for a table of 20, I can't fault the wait staff for being a little slow, co-ordinating with the kitchen to have 20 appetizers and 20 entrees with sides ready simultaneously is a tremendous challenge, and I feel they did a great job.

Gio's is a great place to have a quality Italian meal, it's expensive, but I think good things are worth paying for. :)"}
{"text":"I can't believe I hadn't been to this restaurant sooner. Lively crowd, tasty food, active bar, good music  - all in all a great place to hang out on a Friday night. Only problem - it seems to empty out around 11ish, a bit early in my opinion. 

The Italian menu doesn't disappoint; the food is on par with several other good Italian restaurants in the city. Butternut squash crespelle appetizer is a must-have."}
{"text":"One of the reliably fantastic experiences in Leslieville.  I keep going back for more.  It is best to experience this as a good sized group of four or more prepared to share because otherwise you will have a hard time making up your mind on what to order.  

Highlights of last night's meal included the much touted melt in your mouth crespelle with butternut squash and the fall of the bone beef ribs as well as the scallops and pork belly, sexy duck, mushroom side and , well, pretty much everything else on the menu.  Even with a group of six we had difficulty narrowing our choices.

We were seated in the new room and found it very pleasant and somewhat quieter than the main dining room.  They only accept reservations for tables of six or more.  Another reason why it is good to go as a group."}
{"text":"This place is delicious, I am never disappointed when I come here!

Went on Saturday night and the place was packed but the food came out nice and timely.

Service is quick and food is great.

We will be back again soon"}
{"text":"I have been to \"The Nose\" about four times now and I absolutely love this restaurant! I'm new to TO and tried this place one night and now it's my go to restaurant :) Anytime we have guests in from out of town, we come here.  Service is great, ambience/vibe is perfect, not too loud but definitely not quiet.  And the food,  I love it! Dish sizes are great, price is right, and the service/food has been amazing every time.
My fave so far: Pulled pork wrapped in beef with goat cheese... Dee-lish!"}
{"text":"This is my family's go-to place. We always know it's going to be good no matter what we order. We always splits some apps (sea scallops, risotto balls) and then go big with the main dishes. All the pastas are amazing and as for dessert? The tiramisu is classic and a perfect (and light!) way to end the meal. 

Hint: check out the back room - it used to be a bank vault. This fact alone increases it's cool factor at least 5 points."}
{"text":"Gio Rana's... another Leslieville hit!  Have been here many times over the years with various friends and have always had a good experience Good service and food, great place to take friends.  Unpretentious yet simultaneously classy with a bit of an edge, dare I say, and the crespelle is indeed wonderful (the squash crepes).  Great for vegetarians as well as carnivores. And if you're the type who likes to share and share alike, this is your place. 

The food is interesting and yet at the same time fairly basic, if that makes sense. 

Recently I was here with a picky friend and the waiter was very accommodating, answered all questions, and provided numerous options. 

One thing, tends to be noisy as it's popular and busy, and is located in a former bank and the acoustics aren't fantasic. 

Otherwise, always a pleasure."}
{"text":"A very fun place. The staff are ALWAYS nice, they know us by name.  The food is always good.  The prices are great.  This is ALWAYS a safe bet and a fun time.

LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"The food is decent, certainly not among the best restaurants of Toronto, and the value of some dishes seems quite good. However, no price point should come with bad service.

PS: They have a poor beer selection."}
{"text":"I recently dined at Gio Rana's with my girlfriends in the Vault. We had an amazing meal!! They don't usually take reservations BUT if you have 6-8 guests coming to dinner you can reserve the old bank vault and have a semi private dinner. Drinks were great, food was AMAZING. We really loved how they served our sides on a big platter for all of us to share. Most of us had the pork involtini and some had the salmon. Both were perfectly cooked. The timing of our food (restaurant was packed by the way) was just right. The only thing we would have liked is that our server pay a little bit more attention to us at the end of our meal - we were sitting for quite some time waiting for our bill and waiting to pay. We will all go back 100%."}
{"text":"Great food, casual atmosphere, decor is not really my style but the food makes up for it.  Overall its one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Food was ok but they seem confused about what they are. The music was soo loud my husband lost his voice shouting just to communicate with the group we were with. We asked for it to be turned down and apparently lots of guests request the same.  Management should take note. We won't be going back because of this. We don't like eating at restaurants that think they're clubs despite customers requesting for lower volumes so they can have a conversation over dinner."}
{"text":"Unbeatable Italian - we had the shrimp fettuccine and it was full of buttery peppery deliciousness as well as the branzino which was perfectly cooked.   We walked in off the street on a Saturday at 8 and got a table for two with only a short wait. The waiter was phenomenal and brought a lot of character to the meal."}
{"text":"After having sat in the entry way, because a group of 3 was not acceptable to their standards we had to leave after an hour. Seeing groups of 2 or 4 go ahead, whilst we were on the list way ahead of them they informed us that there was only one table for 3 people and we would simply have to wait. After spending $50 on three glasses of wine and seeing a former colleague being served free cocktails and being seated ahead of us - it was insulting and embarrassing. I'm fairly certain there was racial bias involved. 3 people is an odd number but when hosting a friend from out of town and being treated so poorly, it does not reflect well on Toronto, Gio Rana's or us. Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"\"The Nose\" has always been a 'go to' for good quality at a good price.  We went over the weekend and prices have increased and a couple of the portions are smaller.  So, my reasoning for always returning is no longer valid.

Probably won't return as the price quality ratio is no longer true..."}
{"text":"More like Gio Rana's Really Really Mediocre Restaurant. Man, I have been waiting to say that for an entire week! 

As soon as we sat down, it was quite obvious that our server wanted us out of there asap.  She asked us if we were ready to order after having been seated for less than a minute. If I wanted to be treated like theatre crowd I would have gone to KitKat or Fred's Not Here.

The food was OK, not terrible, but nothing to write home about.  I had the house wine, which was pretty terrible. This is coming from a girl who drank 2 buck chuck for an entire year while on a budget.

I left unimpressed and unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick dinner on a week night. The place wasn't too crowded, we got a table right away. 

We tried the Grande Meatball and the Pan-seared Scallops for appetizers and they were both decent. I had high hopes for the mains after the appetizer, but was disappointed by what came next. I went with the classic Rigatoni in tomato and basil sauce. Most of the pasta had cracked and broken up and i couldn't taste even a hint of basil in the sauce. The other entree we tried was the garlic shirmp with risotto cake, it came with 3 small pieces of shrimp. Nothing to write home about. 

In addition, our server wasn't very attentive. We had to go up to the front to pay in the end because we couldn't even flag him down.

Will not be returning to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Good place but, too crowded and dark. Great food and service."}
{"text":"Best food, best hospitality ! MUST VISIT IN TORONTO! Don't miss Involtini .... Oh man! Real food orgasm!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in the city. A great atmosphere, wonderful staff, and the food is to die for. 

I have been coming to this restaurant for over 10 years and have not had an unsatisfactory meal or experience.

Mind you sharing is a must. It is fantastic for big crowds or just a cozy dinner for two. The only danger is that you might have to be rolled out of the restaurant because of over consumption."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident! Had grilled calamari, risotto balls, rigatoni, steak, osso, mix seafood and espresso cake. Everything we ate was very good. Good priced wine! HD the Veneto ripasso! Love love this place"}
{"text":"Incredible food. Incredible service. Fun atmosphere. I have been to Gio's numerous times and every experience has been perfect. The dining room offers so many different areas that all offer a different vibe - one of my favourite spots is beside the vault near the front of the main dining room. I also like the table in the wine cellar for large groups. It's great to sit at the bar if you're wanting a drink and dessert after dinner at home. It's often very busy so try visiting on a week night rather than a saturday night. One of the best restaurants in Toronto!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here a number of times with friends, family and even our kids.  Service is top notch as is food and atmosphere. We even have a family member in a wheelchair and they enthusiastically accommodate us!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday with some 3 friends. I had the osso bucco and we shared the giant meat ball and crespelles. Was a lot of food (good portion sizes) The osso bucco was pretty good, and the foccacia for soaking up all the sauces was amazing, but the highlight we all agreed upon were the crespelles. Soft pillowy texture surrounding silky cheese. It is really loud on account of the high ceilings (This used to be a bank of Nova Scotia, but it closed after getting robbed too many times) but not so bad that I couldn't hear other people at the table. Great atmosphere with cool artwork and dim lighting. Service was attentive and on point."}
{"text":"I hosted my boyfriend's birthday dinner for a large group at Gio Rana's this past Saturday, and I would give this restaurant 6 stars if I could. I spoke with the manager a couple weeks before the dinner and he walked me through the prix fixe menu option, the wine list, and answered all my questions patiently. Our server Victoria was on the ball the entire evening, and was even able to give us separate bills without any problems. The service was quick and friendly, including the bartenders. Everyone who works at this restaurant seems to really love working there, and it shows in their enthusiasm. The food was absolutely delicious, we had different courses including calamari, boconcini salad, spicy shrimp, pork loin, salmon, beef brisket, pasta, meatballs, sweet potato ravioli, and other items I'm sure I'm forgetting about. Everyone was absolutely stuffed by the end of the meal, and it only cost $40 per person. Amazing value. The decor is fun, chic, cool, but not too stuffy. Somehow it's the kind of environment where you can wear anything from jeans to a cocktail dress and still feel comfortable. We were lucky enough to get the side room behind the main bar which has a large retractable garage door that opens up onto Queen St (there was no extra cost or minimum-spend to use this room). Everyone in my group was raving about the restaurant, from the decor to the food to the service. If you're looking for a fun, trendy but laid-back place to host a group dinner I HIGHLY recommend Gio Rana's"}
{"text":"I think Gio's is really nice. I really do.

It is the best choice in the neighborhood and is consistent. The food is always of consistent quality, the service is very good (no matter who you have) The drinks are reasonably priced and the atmosphere lends to a good meal experience. Always.  It is our go-to place when we have friends come in from out of town and they want to eat close to our house as we know that we are guaranteed a memorable time. Casual and always buzzing. Great for birthdays. 

The Salmon is really good. The Osso Bucco is a favorite of my SOs, and the Calamari is tasty, as is the Gnocchi.

The \"Sides\" are not really worth it. They are small portions and are always left over.  If you order a couple of things and share tapas style, you get the best value. A decent bottle of wine is $40."}
{"text":"The food was yummy and the atmosphere was lovely. The staff were great also. The music was a bit too loud but otherwise I had a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"7PM Sat reservation for 10. Quickly seated, specials recited, drinks distributed. Server was excellent in organizing our order and suggested the Involtini for me. Yumm!! Add to that the 2 shared sides of rapini and chopped salad and I was in gastro-heaven.

Efficient service, delicious food, lively atmosphere. 5 stars. 

Next time I go I am taking a hook and eye from Home Depot to install on the bathroom door stall on the left. I am NOT kidding!"}
{"text":"Have been to Gio's ( the Nose as we call it ) many times over the last 10 years. It's fun, a bit gritty and I love the rotating art displays. Menu has stayed the same with very few updates--but everything we have tried has been delicious. The involtini is a favourite though it does not look pretty on the plate. 
I would recommend staying away on weekend nights if loud music bugs you ( bring the excedrin) . Does not work well if you want to have a conversation with a low talker. 

Overall it's consistent and a fun place to bring friends or family."}
{"text":"My in laws and parents were visiting and we decided to try a place close to home so we went with \"The Nose\". My sister booked the private room which was cozy and lovely. Our amazing waiter Manny suggested the family style dinner for us and it didn't disappoint! The wine he recommend as well was beautiful. We were thrilled with the excellent service and amazing food!  Meatballs were out of this world!! We will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went there last Friday night.  I wouldnt say the food was great but the ambiance was excellent.  It had a great fun vibe and our server was hilarious.  Will definately go back"}
{"text":"Consistently excellent food, service, and wine list that really offers value for the money.  They will take reservations for groups of 5+ but smaller numbers will have to chance it.  A minor quibble that won't cause me to drop any stars from the rating because really, in 12+ outings, I have never had anything close to a bad meal or experience here.   Believe another reviewer mentioned the crespelle, a ravioli-like pasta filled with butternut squash in a sage butter sauce, which stands out as one of the best dishes, along with the sexier duck, one of the tastiest versions of confit you'll encounter in the city.  Yummy, and guaranteed to win you accolades from the friends and family you take to this place."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining here last night. The food was fabulous. I had the white sea bass and greens. To die for. The staff was courteous, our server Gary was tops and explained my meal to perfection. It was perfection, I ate every mouthful. I'm from the west end and a friend of mine suggested this place because it was suggested to him. Word of mouth is the best advertising and it proved so in this instance. Tiramisu was also delicious. Thank you and I will certainly recommend this restaurant. It certainly does have a \"Nose\" for quality!. Dee"}
{"text":"The ambiance is messy and dirty, literally you can look up and see the dust on the vents and fans. The place is not even painted properly. I thought they were under construction, but apparently 'that's their style'. It's tacky in a dirty way, not in a fun hipster way. The tables are super small, that you have to literally stack plates to eat. The tables are also really close to each other, that the waiters will hit your chair at least a few times a night. The waiters are dressed casually, but not in a preppy way or even in a hipster way, just in a 'homeless man' way. 

The music is terrible. It's super loud. They play the crappy stuff on top 40. 

The service is alright, I mean you do get your food - if that's your standard. Some things I asked the waiter to bring never show up. They just leave the pitcher of water on your table for you to serve yourself. It took a lot for me to get the waiters attention, at least 6 tries calling him over. 

The food is not good. You can eat it. If that's your standard. For starters we ordered the focaccia bread, which was four tiny pieces of crostini, NOT focaccia!! You would think a place masquerading as Italian would know what focaccia is. We had the scallops with pork belly - it was two pieces for $10; quite a lot for just two. It was over cooked and the pork belly makes it extra salty. We had this cheese starter, and it was something you can't go wrong with - they just serve cheese not make it right, but when you slice it it was really cold, as if it came out of the freezer cold, to put it in perspective. 

We had Gnocchi with bolognese sauce (ragu), which was TERRIBLE. You're wondering how could gnocchi be bad? well, they made it in-house, and it is literally potato sized oval shaped gnocchi - did they get lazy here or not know what gnocchi is? The sauce had no taste, as if they threw together tomato sauce and ground beef in a pan and served it as is. 

I had the braised ossobuco, which was ok. It was not a good ossobuco, but ok. It was cooked. The flavour was all over the place but masked with a lot of peppers, I don't know why. I added lemon to it, and it was then something I could eat.  

For additional sides we had the asparagus, which was the only thing they got right, and the rapini, which was super hard (not something you could eat). The bread they brought for the table was good - I mean it's bread. 

Generally though everything we ordered had too much pepper. Their kitchen is on the side, with very minimal light coming in - I'm not sure if that explains why the food is terrible - they can't see what they're making. 

For wine we had Chianti - it tasted cheap. 

This place is terrible. We couldn't wait to get out. They didn't just get it wrong on one aspect, but everything! Would not recommend or go back. People of Toronto, get some descent expectations and stop riding on hypes, which give places like this good reviews when really it's the hype talking."}
{"text":"Gio Rana's is like a Really Really Nice East Side Mario's

That's not necessarily a bad thing.  I waffled back and forth on this place, unable to decide if it was worth three or four stars.  I settled on three and a half, and rounded down because it's Monday.  Notwithstanding the rating, I recommend you try it at least once.

After a weekend jam-packed with excitement, Thursday seems so long ago but I remember vividly the group of about 20 of us that gathered to say farewell to FARC and fellow meatatarian Deanna \"if it once ate, I'll eat it at least once\" W.  I arrived late but still had a little time to case the joint before getting a beer* in my hand and my order in.  Gio Rana's is built inside an old bank**, with high ceilings and an open-concept kitchen near the back of the large dining area.  It's not that exciting, save for the Really Really cool private wining and dining room that used to be the bank's vault.

The menu consisted of a sheet of white paper, printed double-sided, in a ratty plastic sheath.  Really Really cheap-looking.  Thankfully, selection was good, and everyone at the table seemed to be able to find something they wanted.  I found lots, and ended up settling on pan-seared scallops with pork belly and jus, pork tenderloin in a walnut and gorgonzola sauce and beet, tomato and goat cheese salad. (these, and two bottles of beer, set me back $60 including a respectable gratuity).

Scallops

My first bite gave me a bit of a foodgasm.  Two scallops, and a healthy dose of pork belly.  They were Really Really big, and perfectly cooked.  Regrettably, a bit of grit (not sure if that's a given with scallops, but I wish it weren't).  The pork belly was a nice nod at the more traditional bacon-wrapping, and the jus was a nice complement.

Pork Tenderloin

Really Really Nice Gorgonzola sauce.  Portion was quite large, and the pork was nicely done.  Found myself mopping up the sauce with whatever I could find around me.  Eventually just picked the plate up and licked it clean.

Beet Salad

Tasty, but unremarkable.  It was what it was and I'd probably try something else next time.  Also, got hit with a giant piece of onion near the end of it that left me with onion-mouth until I got a few pints of draught in me at our next stop.

Service:  

Our group of 20 was handled professionally from where I was sitting.  Deanna's co-FARC Christine \"charfcuterator\" C may beg to differ; sitting across from me the poor doll was elbowed and bumped for most of her time at the table.  Still, we were taken care of and we weren't kept waiting any longer than might be expected for such a large group.

Is Gio Rana's Really Like an East Side Mario's?  Really?

I kinda think so.  It's loud and chaotic, and the décor is equally kitschy.  The service is \"run around like a chicken with your head cut off\" style (but effective) and the place is good for large groups.  

While the food is absolutely delicious, I still feel like I'm getting hosed when I pay 60 bucks at a place that so desperately needs a makeover (or at least a nosejob) and has such horribly cheap-looking menus.

{"text":"Because of all the disruption from the G20 (don't get me started), I decided to move my birthday dinner to Queen East.

I was having a hard time finding a restaurant that took reservations for large groups that wasn't located around the downtown core.

I read a really really large number of Yelp reviews about Gio Rana's Really Really Nice Restaurant and I decided to give it a try.

I found the decor really really plain.
They had some neat artwork, but the venue itself was pretty unimpressive.  It was basically a really really big room with tables.

The place is really really casual and unpretentious.
The food is really really nice.   

Well prepared and the portions are a nice size.
* I had the famous giant meatball.  It's a really really big meatball.
* The fried calamari (and shrimp) was tasty but they don't give you a whole lot.
* Pork tenderloin in Gorgonzola sauce  was slightly overcooked but the sauce was really really good.
* Duck and short ribs were popular at the table and really really tasty.
* Tartufo was a bit frozen from being left in the freezer a little too long.
* Goat's milk cheese cake... is good if you like goat cheese for dessert.

This place is really really good for groups.
The service was really really good for a large party.
They also let me hand out cupcakes and use their fridge without hassle.

The price of the food is reasonable, they just need to spruce up the place.. a lot.  Casual and quirky is not the same as really really boring.

Overall, I had a really really nice time.  But I don't think this place ranks as one of my favorites.  However, I was also really really drunk,  and I may have to revisit when I'm sober."}
{"text":"Such a great spot! The food is always delicious and always consistent! Staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is very New York Chic. 

You can't go wrong with any of there choices. I would def recommend having a martini before dinner! It can get very packed after about 7 pm, so i would recommend going early to ensure you get a table."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner and I used to think this place was an art gallery. I mean there's tinted windows and a huge paper mache nose in place of signage. 

I came here for my birthday on a Saturday night and it was PACKED. Got there around 8 and waited til 9 for a table for two so I was pretty starved. (Host was nice. She kept coming back to make sure we were not dead from hunger and offered us drinks menu and such.)

The interior of this place is beautiful. Very dim with rustic/hip look and decorated with artwork and vintage photographs. Incredibly LOUD with music and chatter but also kind of cramped feeling.

Our waiter was nice. But since the restaurant was busy and noisy, he didn't come by very often. We ordered the beef carpaccio ($10) for an appetizer. For the main, I got the duck leg ($15) and my boyfriend got the beef tenderloin steak ($22). (You have to order sides on top... - our waiter advised us to get one to share - we got the Yukon potatoes for $5.)

Beef Carpaccio: The plate was a bit smaller than I expected to share for two. I think it was meant for one. It was okay but the vinegar and cheese were really strong and there was a lot of it. It blocked the flavor and texture of the beef so I just rubbed the vinegar/cheese off. Arugula, however, was a wonderful compliment.

Duck leg: First off, I like my duck cooked very specifically so that it's very tender. The duck was just okay and a little hard/dry in some places. Skin was very nice and crispy but hard to cut with the knife I was given. I did not like the jus.

Beef Tenderloin: YUM! If I came back, this is what I'd get. A hunking piece of juicy and tender meat that was cooked perfectly as requested (rare).

Verdict: Not bad but not worth the hype. I left feeling somewhat ripped off (which is not how you should feel after leaving a restaurant)."}
{"text":"My family enjoyed a wonderful dinner last night at \"The Nose\" restaurant.  Dubbed \"The Nose\" for the big nose sculpture above the entrance!  We arrived just before 6:00pm and was immediately seated. Other young families were there as well, but I wouldn't say it's a family restaurant if you arrive later in the evening. The seating is tight and atmosphere more adult with a nude mannequin in the entrance way, covered by a boa scarf. 

We were served focaccia bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar while waiting for our dinner. The kids gobbled up the massive meatball and bolognese pasta.  The restaurant offers half portions for the children, although it was still a huge meal and we were able to bring some home. My husband enjoyed the calamari (cooked beautifully) and the delicious butternut squash ravioli in a cream sauce.  Our server recommended a bold Waterstone Cab Sauv, which we both thought was fabulous.  My Roasted Beet salad was divine with the perfect balance of sweet dressing and nutty arugula. The Chicken Cacciatore was okay.  I liked the sauce but wasn't a fan of the dark meat and wish it was noted on the menu (I would prefer a chicken breast). 

The restaurant does look worn and dirty in daylight.  I'm sure the string of lights hanging from the ceiling and low lighting hides many of the stains and scratches on the walls. I actually had 3 glasses returned because they were dirty with lipstick and finger prints, but my server was very apologetic and attentive. 

Overall, we'd go back for the meatballs!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this restaurant - the food is delicious!! I had one of their pasta dishes, and it was one of the best in the city. I even tried to get our company event at this restaurant! I went out with a group, and across the board our table was pleased."}
{"text":"Lovely Italian tapas, great ambience. It feels like being in an 18th century hideout. I had the fritto misto as an app and the white fresh water bass, both extremely delicious. 
Definitely want to revisit!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and mouth watering food. 

My husband booked \"The Vault\" for my surprise birthday dinner a year ago, and it was such a hit. They actually have a bank vault inside the restaurant that can seat up to 12 people. It's a cosy and intimate vibe, and the service is fantastic. 

The Good:
- Delicious food, truly Italian!
- The servers are awesome!

The Bad:
- Sometimes it takes quite a bit of time for the food to arrive, but they're always busy which is good!
- The decor could use a bit of work :)

Highly suggest the Big Meatball, and the pulled pork!"}
{"text":"How did I find out about this restaurant? Read my previous review on Fare Bistro as this is a continuation of what could have been a horrible night, but turned out into a wonderful, wonderful evening.

Intro. My amour, the ever spontaneous and great-researcher, found out about this restaurant (on Yelp!!!!) and we decided to go there as we were actually 2 blocks away. He called and was informed there were tables for 2 but no reservations would be taken. We quickly walked. My amour said that there was a nose outside the restaurant and I noticed it first. As you walk in, you think it's going to be a dingy, small place, but as you turn a quick corner into the restaurant, it's expansive and tall and BUSY! We did got a lovely, secluded spot and I immediately loved it.

Food. My amour said the food was nothing special, but for me, it was so very, very, good. It could have been the let-down I experienced at Fare Bistro and so I was willing to think any other restaurant was better. Or, it could have been simple Italian food done well. Either way, I was not disappointed. For appetizers, we had the Fritto Misto (which was sort of a disappointment because it was one fried shrimp and one fried calamari. I believe Fritto Misto is supposed to be a medley of vegetables and none other than the Zucchini Flower). We also had Scotty's Meatballs which is just one large meatball in tomato sauce and bruschetta which was very good.

For the main, I had the duck leg which was soooo very tasty and tender. I am a big duck fan so despite the ordinary appetizers, I was in love with my duck. My amour had the cod in papillote which was also very tasty. The fish is not fishy, but tender. My amour also had the risotto as a primi piatti which was divine. The risotto was not al dente which is how I normally like mine cooked, but it was delicious nonetheless. And for dessert, we shared the Tiramisu which was a fitting end to a lovely night.

Service. AMAZING! We were served by (I think his name was Zack), and he just made the whole evening. 

Ambiance. Busy. Noisy. Walls are kind of dingy, but you're here for that homey kind of place. 

All in all, I would recommend this restaurant to anybody in the area. I do not think this restaurant is expensive, so you are going to get your value for your money. It is just a fun, fun place to eat. I am only beginning to discover Leslieville restaurants, and glad to have discovered this place."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend figured since this was fairly popular amongst Italian food lists, that it was worth checking out, and would be good stuff. 

Service- Really helpful and enthusiastic, awesome job :) 

Atmosphere -The lighting was just below romantic, and more in the \"I-wish-I-was-a-nocturnal-creature-to-see-my-fork.\" 

Food- He got the involtini, which was excellent but was a really small portion (as was everything else. I got the Stuffed chicken, but it had no stuffing inside, which was kinnnnnnnnd of disappointing. The pasta portions wouldn't be enough for a toddler, the mashed potatoes were alright, but I was nauseated when I left and my boyfriend thought he was going to throw up shortly after we left (and he has an iron stomach.) 

Atmosphere -The lighting was just below romantic, and more in the \"I-wish-I-was-a-nocturnal-creature-to-see-my-fork.\" The nose outside, plywood table and all around atmosphere was neat. Looked more of a bad idea gone well than an intended creative venture, but to each their own, I suppose."}
{"text":"Went for a birthday in February of 2016. 

1) The food was really enjoyable. I got to try about 7 different dishes and they were all between pretty good and great.
2) Oddly disproportionate portion sizes. Obviously part of this is based on the relative price ingredients used, but most of the group seemed to find it hard to know how much to order. Some couples ordered 3 dishes and were stuffed, others ordered 4 and were barely full.
3) Slightly pricey but I enjoyed the food, and it's just the norm in trendy parts of Toronto.
4) The service was quite slow, and the two staff members we interacted with most were not agreeable at all. One was generally snippy and one smiled at the table an visibly switched to a scowl the moment he turned away (on one occasion he seemed to be muttering something, but I couldn't hear it...) Bad days happen but this was excessive; none of the servers seemed to be enjoying the work at all.

In all fairness, it sucks to serve a table of 12, so I'll probably go back as a table of 2 or 4 to give the restaurant a shot. If the service is the same I won't go back because the quality of the food doesn't make up for the attitude we dealt with. Fingers are crossed that's not the case though."}
{"text":"great food, great atmosphere. try the giant meatball its delicious. the restaurant is a bit out of the way if you dont live in the beaches or really east of the city but its worth the drive!
I've never been caught waiting for a table and always had a good experience. try the Lalot Italien Pinot Grigio if they still have it, its awesome!"}
{"text":"Never knew this place existed.  Was invited to a group dinner on a fall Friday evening at 7:00.  Heard in advance from someone that this place \"has the big nose\" out front.  Yes, it does.  LOL  An old, 80s-looking establishment  that is a closed bank building, with a big nose above the door.  I wish the nose was lower for picture-taking, but I see that there could be risk of idiots vandalizing said nose, or something.

Upon entering, was immediately greeted by staff as to ask if we wanted a table, which was obvious that we wouldn't be able to get one.  It was packed.  Maybe 20 tables in a big room.  Dark, more candle-lit atmosphere, with windows that allow in some streetlight.  Loud.  Not so much music loud, but the packed place with voices trying to talk over all the other voices.  So if you want a semi-cool atmosphere, go here.  If you want to have a real conversation, you would be hoarse by the end, as if at a club.

Fortunately, due to our party of 12, we had the back private room.  This is the wine cellar, with a long dining table placed inside.  So yes, squished.  But adequate and enjoyable nonetheless.  You just have to be careful when pulling out your chair to not knock one of the wine bottles off the shelves that wrap around the whole room, since it is a cellar.  

The menu itself does not seem to be online, however.  I had the sweet potato mash as a side.  Yum!  And I ordered the daily pasta special which was a vegetarian option, something pretty standard but also yum!  Based on the others in the group, everything was good, including something with halibut and the mozzerella tomato salad.  I wish I could write more about individual dishes.  My food bill was under $20.  I ordered a $39 bottle of white wine, which was good, but the food here itself is enough to give this place a thumb's up.

Service was quite good.  People told him he looked like David Arquette.  I hadn't noticed until it was mentioned, but he did, a bit.  

Bill was all on one, as per usual in this circumstance.

Definitely want to go back and try the main restaurant area - even though, as I said, one would be hoarse after talking over the noise.  It's just a great Leslieville atmosphere, and the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Always a great meal and time here. This time we were reunited with Gianni who was our server and who we know from the now closed Lolita's Lust - he's a great addition to the already fantastic staff."}
{"text":"This is the spot. 

Warm. Cozy. Classy. They dish out perfect meals, and although I don't really like to, I'm obliged to dish out a perfect score. Gio Rana, you've definitely built one really really nice restaurant! :)

Keeping it (very) low key at the northwest corner of Queen and Leslie, Gio Rana's Really Really Nice Restaurant bares no actual signage. Well, there is that massive human nose affixed above the main entrance, but that's about it. 2 points for the conversation starter (annnnd 1 for non-traditional marketing tactics).

A lovely staff will have you seated in what always feels like no time.  If there's a bit of a line up, crack a bottle of wine and warm up in the waiting area.  The staff knows their vino and bottles are definitely well priced.  If you're one for random conversation, the hosts are awesome at indulging in some fun banter before guiding you to your table.

Gio Rana's is a gorgeous space. High ceilings, great background music, warm mood-lighting and beautiful decorative pieces all over the place.  If you've got a group, I suggest booking the wine-cellar in advance. It's gets a bit tight for really large groups, but with the right minds, in that space, you're bound to spark conversations that will change your life.

As if you're not already sold, let's talk a bit about your meal.  

Never one to disappoint, Gio's mouth-watering Antipasti will get your tastebuds dancing at first bite.  If you've got a carnivorous bone, light it up with the \"Classic Beef Carpaccio w/ Grano Padano, Arugula and Lemon\" - wow!!.

The mains are all top notch.  I'd steer away from the chicken if possible and maneuver towards the \"Sexy Duck\" or the Braised Beef Ribs (with portobello and fried gnocchi - zing!).

The Contorni options balance out the meal.  If you're with a group, Gio's generally puts these sides on a long share plate, so you can get a taste of everything.  Is it just me, or does food ACTUALLY taste better when you're sharing it?

If I was forced to be critical of my dear Gio, veggie options don't really exist, and the washrooms could use a reno.  These criticisms are neither here nor there for me though - I'm in love, remember?

Gio Rana's is hands down, my favourite restaurant in Toronto - a definite must for every non-veg foodie around the globe.  Get there soon though.  Queen East is developing rapidly, and it's inevitable that this joint will lose a bit of its charm once West-Queen-West infiltrates."}
{"text":"The nose knows, you know.  That's the only marker indicating you have arrived at my favourite Italian restaurant.  I confess I was reluctant to share this one. There are only a handful of restaurants, including Gio's, that I hold close to my heart. I want to shield them from being overrun by the uncivilized hordes that populate this city and have no appreciation for quality. But that's not you, is it?


This traditional restaurant is one of the funkiest places to eat. Its decor is bargain chic - a haphazard mess of mismatched chairs and beautiful vintage chandeliers. The interesting and well-published fact is that the building used to be a bank, and Gio kept the vault intact to use as a private dining area.  It's details like these that build character, and we know it's all about the details - in life, in fashion, and in food.


The best part of Gio's is the food. Where do I begin?  It's all so good so I'll just tell you what my last meal was: pan-seared scallops with pork belly and Scotty's meatball to start. My primi was the crespelle and I ended with the involtini. If I could, I would order absolutely everything. The sexy duck and ossobuco are two of my other favourites, as is the asparagus with gorgonzola, but that's because I love cheese - and the funnier the name, the more inclined I am to order it. I'm drooling all over my keyboard...


Gio's is simply the best, amazing food in a whimsical setting. All the right elements for a perfect night."}
{"text":"Great italian in Tornoto.  Portions tends to be smaller, but the food is great.  Fritto Misto, beef carpaccio and the Olives were great.  We also enjoyed chicken, involtini pork, sexy duck and crespelle.  Service was fine."}
{"text":"I recall noticing this place way way back when I was in this neighborhood. I recall thinking that it was either a plastic surgeon's office (with a sense of humor!) some oddball art store or a shop that sells eye glasses. Later on I found out it was a restaurant with a repute to boot. A friend who had tried this place recommended trying it.
I got in a bit early and waited at the bar before they open. Didn't get a chance to the menu before hand but osso bucco was already on list of things to try. 
My dining companion arrived later. Here is what we had 
fried rissoto balls. Just beautiful not the dried version one gets nice crispy on the outside with the creamy moist center
crepe with butternut squash. These were average IMO. The sauce was done well here.
My DC ordered the chicken which was stuffed (light on that) though cooked well. It was moist but lacked seasoning IMO.
The osso bucco hit it out of the park. Just gorgeous slathered in rich sauce with the meat that was perfectly tender and the center of marrow. Top dish on this outing. 
I had a glass of Chianti as well which was priced reasonably as well.
We have a winner here folks 4 Stars. I will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place... whether you're going solo and sitting at the bar, having a romantic dinner for 2 or joining a group of friends for a birthday in the vault, this place has u covered! Brilliant service - delicious food and great tunes."}
{"text":"Good, casual atmosphere with servers pouring the alcohol quite liberally.

Our table of 2 arrived at \"The Nose\" on a Friday evening without a reservation. We only had to wait 15 minutes at the bar, before we were seated. Bartenders poured us both very large glasses of wine.

Bread was brought to our table, along with waters. We perused the menu and noticed that there was a pretty good selection. 

We ordered and shared the:

- sea scallops with pork belly (flavourful pork belly)
- stuffed risotto balls (a bit bland)
- fig with goat cheese (only one piece of fig)
- Involtini - shredded pork wrapped in rib eye (not very appealing to the eye. It was presented as 3 small log pieces but was delicious)

Main dishes run from around $12-$17 each.

Overall, the service was pretty good. Our waiter was attentive and there are many servers clearing the tables and re-filling water/drinks.

My main critique is that portion sizes are small for the price. You may also find that the dishes are not appealing to the eye, but could end up being tasty."}
{"text":"this place is really yummy. it's so none pretentious yet cool. 
I love everything on the menu. The portions aren't huge especially for the pasta dishes but the price reflected is also very fair. 
And what's to complain? So you have room for more of their very reasonably priced dishes. 
I particularly love their meatmall in ragu sauce. Such a classic and they nailed it."}
{"text":"To begin - TO FIND THIS PLACE, LOOK FOR THE NOSE. 

Some background - I am visiting Toronto from the Northern Virginia area, and I was not eating meat from Monday through Wednesday, so this Thursday dinner, I was looking forward to this meal.  

So I hadn't planned this meal, and I called a friend in the states to look up something on yelp, but since he wasn't sure of the layout of Toronto, he wasn't coming up with anything.  I had remembered looking up restaurants earlier, and found this restaurant consistently coming up in the searches.  I asked for the address.   1220 Queen St E.  This might be strange for me to mention.  So we got on the street car on Queen St, after walking from Eaton Center.  This seemed to be a no brainer.  We got there, we are looking around.  

Two things I learned after this visit to this restaurant. 

1. Many buildings are not numbered in the city. 
2. Make sure you have the phone number. 

We couldn't find the restaurant based on the number.  We noticed a building with a big nose on the front that seemed funny.  My friend who's from Toronto, thought that we must be on the wrong side, and my friend from the states must have read it wrong from the website.  So we headed on the street car all the way to 1220 Queen West, which is completely on the other side of the area.  As you might have imagined, once we got there, of course it wasn't there.  I got a phone number to this place, and found that it was indeed East. So at this point more determined than ever, I decided that we were going to eat at this place.  So once again, we got on the street car the other direction.  It's a good thing she has a monthly pass, because these tokens were costing me an arm and a leg.  

So we get back to where we were roughly an hour earlier.  Mind you we left for this place around 6 and got there around 8:30.  So we're looking around, again not seeing it. We figured we'd got see what this nose was.  And of course, it is Gio Rana's.  

SO, for anyone going to this place, LOOK FOR THE NOSE.  LOOK AT THE PICTURES, otherwise you wont' find this place.  TAKE DOWN THE NUMBER IN CASE YOU ARE LOST.  We were walking around in this bitter cold, which added to the mess. 

Ok, now to the restaurant experience itself.  

1. This place seemed to be bustling with a full restaurant on a Thursday night.  
2. We were seated in another awkward place in front of the window, and had to slide by some other folks to get in there, but we had a bit more privacy.  
3. We decided on calamari for an appetizer. 
4. We asked two separate waiters for suggestions. 

a. the first waiter recommended - the involtini and the rib eye.  He said he would often crave a involtini on many a late night
b. the second waiter recommended - the involtini and the ossobuco

So we ordered, the fritto misto appetizer, for entrees we ordered the involtini and the ossobuco.  No alcohol or other drinks, just water. 

The fritto misto was decent, my friend said she had better.  I thought it was ok. 

The ossobuco was pretty tasty.  The involtini was ok.  We took the leftovers home which I ate some of on saturday, and I had the same feeling.  Ossobuco was tasty.  The involtini was ok.  It is amazing to see a cold ossobuco, and how much fat there is in the sauce.  But I guess that's the price of eating out. 

The environment seemed pretty good for a date.  We just had a long night even getting there.  The service was ok.  The waiters seemed pretty nice, but very busy.  

I am giving this place a 3.5, but since I can't it's getting rounded down to a 3.  This was decent, but there seems to also be a lot of hype.  I would have to try it out again with less drama getting there for me to accurately rate it. 

This also ran about 11-30 per person, again, no alcohol or other drinks, just water in the bill.  

REMEMBER LOOK FOR THE NOSE."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's usually my first pick when anyone suggests Italian.

It's very busy just about every night of the week.  When you get there, you'll be offered to order a drink while you wait, which is nice touch as it makes you feel as they have not forgotten you.  The waiting area by the door is quite small though.  The restaurant is large but they keep the lighting quite dark which gives in an intimate feeling.  To be truthful, it's so dark I'm not sure what the decor really looks like as I've only been for dinner.

With the restaurant so busy, the service is still good.  The wait staff manages to come by your table often to refill water and is eager to make recommendations if you ask.  I would recommend anyone coming here to order the meatball.  It's probably one of the best things on the menu!  Another top recommendation would be the Osso Bucco."}
{"text":"The formula is simple: if you like flavour, you're not afraid of sharing, and you want an exceptional night out, the Nose (aka Gio's) is the place for you. I've probably been to this place 50+ times over the years and there isn't a single time I have walked out disappointed. The food is served family-style, so you will get to try many small bites while you're here. Usually you share all the appetizers, order your own entrée, and share the sides. 
I have tried every item on the menu (though it does change pretty frequently, they keep the favourites) and it's all delicious. Scotty's meatball is devine. It's tender, perfectly cooked every time, and served with tomato sauce that is so good they could sell it as a beverage. The seared scallop served with pork belly is the next best appetizer. For mains, fan favourites are the Osso Buco and the Involtini. If you're like me and like something a bit lighter, the fish options are really flavourful. If you're a less adventurous eater, don't feel bad ordering the chicken! It is very moist thanks to the layer of carmalized onion puree under the amazingly crisped skin, and the jus adds the perfect touch. My favourite sides are the brussel sprout slaw (served with parmigiano reggiano and crisp pancetta) and the grilled asparagus topped with gorgonzola. 
The servers here are awesome, attentive, and they've been the same for years; they know the menu inside and out and could recommend something even for the pickiest eaters and toughest critics. The setting is cool with great music, interesting art pieces, and sky-high ceilings. 
If you are looking for white table cloths and food presented with the use of a ruler, skip the Nose. They don't want you there anyway. Everyone else, enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. The grilled calamari was a great recommendation by our bartender - super tender and packed with flavour. I had the gnocchi, and my husband the risotto - both delicious.  While mine was super rich, it made me glad I ordered the small - my husband probably should have ordered a lg. 

All in all, great customer service and the food to back up the hype.

Will be back."}
{"text":"I've yet to find a restaurant in Toronto that has a better all-around dining experience. From the incredible food, great service, trendy design, fantastic music and fun atmosphere, the Nose is by far in a way my favourite restaurant to go to. Whenever I need a place to bring out-of-towners, or a cool date-spot, this is always my go-to. Everyone I bring seems to love this place by the time they leave, and you can always count on it to be hustling and bustling with activity - even on a Tuesday in the dead of winter. My menu must-haves are the giant meatball, the crespelle, the fried calamari, the beef ribs and the osobucco. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a couple of times and the food and service is very consistent... Amazing food and the staff there is extremely friendly... A must try is their meatball!! It's da bomb and it's the best meatball I have ever had!!! One thing is finding a parking spot there is a pain!!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty interesting place.  Overall, the experience was good.  Food was tasty, service good, atmosphere great.  In terms of value I think there's room for improvement.  The entrees are ordered a-la carte, so when you order the chicken or fish it usually comes with nothing else but the meat.  You need to order your sides all separately.  It ends up adding quite a bit to the bill, since the entrees run around $15-20, and the sides in the $6-8 range.  The quality of food is high, so if you're willing to splurge a bit this is a good place.  3.5 stars overall."}
{"text":"We went out to this wonderful neighbourhood restaurant with friends and the most amazing sampler meal!  Great price point for a great combination of food and great service! Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The food is amazing & the staff are great. I have booked them for many birthday dinners & highly recommend the private table in the wine vault if you have a group of 8+ people (except in the summer, it gets really hot)."}
{"text":"I have been to Gio's a number of times, and can say without any hesitation that I have never been (even momentarily) disappointed. The wine, food, atmosphere and service are all consistently excellent. It is, quite possibly, my favorite (affordable) restaurant in all of Toronto.

Housed in an old bank building, the space is large with high ceilings. At night, the lights are lowered and candles lit everywhere, bringing a golden intimacy to the space. For larger parties (of probably 8+), you can even reserve the old bank vault at the back of the restaurant (which has been converted into their wine cellar). It's pretty fun to sit in your own vault surrounded by amazing Italian wines.

Must haves:
Antipasti - grilled calamari with capers and tomatoes (it makes people blush, it is so damn tender!)
Primi - crespelle with butternut squash and sage butter sauce (forget everything else you've ever eaten. This is it right here.)
Secondi (Pesce/Carne) - the whole grilled sea bass is incredible. The involtini and the osso buco are equally amazing.

Always ask your server about the specials as well. They often feature decadent Secondi courses for genuinely reasonable prices."}
{"text":"***1/2 stars
 
Zipping down Queen Street East to avoid the horribleness that is the DVP (aka Don Valley Parking Lot) during rush hour to get home to Scarborough, I have driven by Gio Rana's many times.  There is signage, or label - just a grotesque and prominent nose that looms overhead the entrance that has you hoping that no slimy boogers are going to land on your head upon entering.  The restaurant has been dubbed by locals as the \"Nose.\"  I've pondered many times as to why one would choose such a monstrosity as its logo and how it has anything to do with (Italian) food.  The most clever reason I've come up with so far is that food is meant to tantalize the senses, and more often than not, our appetites are aroused simply by inhaling the whaff of aromatic food does the trick.  My more politically incorrect notion is that it might be a play on the stereotype that Italian's have really big schnoz's :p

The decor inside the restaurant is just as puzzling as the jutting nose out front.  Some may call it an ecclectic mish mash of randomness that is actually quite refreshing, some may call it minimalistic, and some may start answering on behalf of Gio Rana's for the up and coming Restaurant Makeover's casting call.  With tables spaced tightly together, I was already thinking of escape routes once this place got busy - and boy did it ever!  The walls are rather \"industrial\" looking as they are bare walls that look like they've been mid-stripped for repainting but then was abandonned.  The focal point is a vent that has been creatively made to resemble a hanging plant.  The mish mash of paintings distracts you until the server comes to tell you the specials.  What place do Japanese paintings have in an Italian restaurant?  Beats me!

A bread plate is quickly presented before us.  The browner and probably \"healthier\" alternative of the two is bland, boring, and a little too boring - while the white tomato bread is almost too pillowy soft.  The balsamic vinegar and olive oil dip however is quite interesting.  Although a tad bit skewed towards the olive oil side, the actual balsamic had an almost sesame-ish and nutty flavour to it that I liked. 

Their cocktails have some pretty raunchy names (e.g. Pink Panty Pulldown or Sexy MOFO).  I ended up going for the French Martini which was made with Chambord, Vodka and Pineapple Juice .  I loved the bit of foam at the top as it gave the drink a creamy texture.  It was a great cocktail, just the right amount of sweet and the alcohol content was not overpowering.

We shared the Seared Scallops & Braised Pork Belly as an appetizer.  I had pretty high expectations for this dish and was rather disappointed by a leaner pork belly which meant it was dried and not as moist or juicy.  The scallops were not overcooked, but lacked the soft and tender texture I look for in a scallop.  In short, while taste-wise this dish was great, it was off on textures. 

The daily pasta special with a roasted half-lobster with spaghettini tossed in garlic butter and tomatoes was a 50/50.  The solid chunks of lobster were easy to eat, but it had an almost \"grainy\" or \"stringy\" texture to it.  For me, the best part of this dish was the actual spaghettini as it wasn't drenched in sauce and was delicious in its simplicity.  Nothing ruins a pasta dish more than being drowned in a heavy sauce. 

We also ordered the Ossobucco which I can say is one of the best I've had.  While I've no doubt had more tender ossobucco in my lifetime, the sauce is what blew me away.  The flavour of the bones fused with no doubt, some butter and wine made this rich sauce drinkable.  I must confess that long after the actual veal was reduced to a bone, I consumed a few spoonfuls of the sauce.  This dish is quite a \"heavy\" dish in that the flavours are really bold and the portion sizes can be overwhelming.  While others may frown upon a smaller portion size at Gio Rana's, I thought the portion size was just right.  And isn't quality more important than quantity anyways?  Plus, you have to save a little bit of room for dessert! 

For dessert I opted for the Goat Cheesecake with Lemon Curd.  I loved the subtle grainy texture that the goat cheese gave to the cake.  The berries reduction also had a slight hint of licorice flavour to it that I liked.  The lemon curd was subtle and not overpowering.  Suffice it to say, I ate most of this divine dessert.

I really really wanted to give the Nose a higher rating.  But I really really was disappointed with the pork belly, and I really really didn't enjoy the noise level that stemmed from sardined tables and loud music in the backdrop.  Service was pretty good as our server checked up on us a few times, our bread plate was replenished when empty, and we were given new plates before our entrées came.

Sides here are a la carte which is rather pretentious for this casual dining resto.  Next time I think I'll come with friends to share small plates."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite restaurant i have ever been to anywhere in the world.  The meatball is amazing.  The pasta is amazing.  The locale is really cool inside too.  Took my 13 year old there and he even said it is his favorite restaurant.  I live in Atlanta, GA but travel to Toronto for work occasionally and making a reservation here is the first thing i do when i plan the trip."}
{"text":"This place wins on the vibe, it is so chill and relaxing perfect for a group of friends or an intimate date.  The place should be called \"the nose\", where they came up with the name is beyond me...

Went with a small group, we tried the GRILLED CALAMARI, always my fav, PROSCUITTO with FIGS.  It was a great blend of flavors. 

For my main, I had the WHOLE FISH, it came with the head and everything, I loved it, it reminds me of traveling and it was just so fresh and delicious!

Go for fun with friends or on a date, it got treat atmosphere and great service, very laid back and cool atmosphere"}
{"text":"The Nose knows what diners want. A cozy, neighborhood trat, the Nose dishes out comforting and fresh tasting italian fare in a warm and inviting atmosphere. High ceilings, huge personable painted portraits and catchy music all contribute to making you feel welcome and at ease. The service here is eager to please, knowledgeble and cute. And the food is simple but full of flavor. I had the involtini, meat shaped cigars of pulled pork wrapped with sheets of beef and topped with goat cheese. Yummy and hearty. The rigatoni in tomato sauce was delicious, pasta was done al dente and the sauce was tangy and rich with lotsa fresh basil. Another visit led to the discovery of their crespelle a decadent crepe filled with roasted butternut squash and covered in a butter cream sage sauce-in my best Oprah impersonation 'it was to DIE FORRRRRRRRR!!' Brussell sprouts was an excellent counter side dish, they were crunchy, light and flecked with smokey specks of pancetta in between, do the veggie sides here rock or what??

This would be a great spot for a casual date, a night out with friends or heck any time you feel like spoiling yourself in unprententious surroundings! There may be more refined or even perhaps even more authentic italian restaurants out there but the Nose wins our hearts by aiming for our stomachs. Count me among the converted!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great atmosphere. Came here for a birthday dinner on a Saturday night. It was extremely busy, so I recommend reservations. 

This wouldn't be a place to take your first date. It's a group dining experience and it's loud. Loud enough that shouting becomes your main way of talking, and then you forget how to talk softly. I'm not even sure how the servers hear us. 

Food was really good. And well priced. Lots of small appetizers to choose from, and really, you could make a meal out of it by just choosing the small dishes and sharing with one or two other people. 

For the two of us, we ordered 2 antipasti and one main course to share, and it was enough with still room for some dessert. 
The Giant Meatball was excellent. I don't know what was in the sauce, or what's in the meatball but I wanted another one. 
The grilled calarmari was also good (not spectacular) but flavourful and soft, yet still crunchy.  ($8.95-$11)

Our main was the slow cooked beef ribs with pan fried gnocchi. I did expect a bed of gnocchi but there were only 4. And they were undercooked and difficult to eat. BUT, the beef ribs was amazeballs. Falling off the bone, even had some tendon to suck on. The sauce was my favourite. 

The service was interesting. Our server was not extra attentive, just enough. We were also sitting right in the middle of the restaurant and it's hard to miss us.

At some point in the meal, we for plates that we were told was pulled pork and something else. Then about 5 minutes later the busboy came and took it away: it was neither pulled pork or for our table. 

However, our server did play along when I was asking for a pretend dessert but really planning a birthday surprise. I guess that's twhere they loudness came into my advantage. 

Our bill couldn't be separate, even by groups. How disappointing. 

The wines we got (reds, 2 different ones) were watery tasting. A coffee connoisseur at the table gave the espresso a 3 out of 5 as the flavour wasn't rich enough. 

Yah, I'd come back . Just the loudness factor really takes away from a good meal."}
{"text":"I've only been to Gios once, but certainly interested in a return visit. The food was authentic, and tasty. Each item we had at the table was delicious. The room has a very cozy vibe and a mixed crowd, mostly attracting a regular clientèle."}
{"text":"The highlight was the meatballs. The services good. The atmosphere was casual. The seating was comfortable. Parking is abundant along Queen St. - at least it was when we visited. 

Unfortunately, the portions were small. I was disappointed especially knowing that they use off the shelf (no freshly made) pasta in a box that when on sale would be a dollar for a 500g container - and that's not the wholesale price! On that alone, they could have offered a couple of strands more of noodles with my lobster fettuccini. On the same dish, the lobster was way over cooked with the pasta coming out just a little better than warm. 

Overall, the experience was alright. The decor was a little interesting, but fit the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"We had dinner at The Nose last week for the first time with friends. The food was great and our server even better! We're planning to go back again soon"}
{"text":"I went to the \"nose\" last week for my regular monthly visit. This place never disappoints. The meatball app is mandatory. This place is not quiet, especially on the weekends, but you will notice  that people are enjoying themselves. The service is always good, you can tell that most of the people who work here aren't newbies to the restaurant buissiness. The service is a good balance of being attentive without being pushy or fake."}
{"text":"What's up??? This place is so close to perfection - amazing food, ambiance, great servers, perfect location EXCEPT, you can not go there and actually have a conversation with the people at your table. The music is sooo unnecessarily loud it's beyond frustrating. We met with friends that we haven't seen in a while and we all felt like we were yelling at each other. This place really does deserve a 4-5 star but the loud music really turned all of us off. What's the point of going for dinner if it's that difficult to converse with the people you're sitting with?"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in the area and I've been here on many occasions!

One of my favourite things about this restaurant is the ambience. It's a great place for a date or a dinner with friends. It's beautifully decorated and usually has some good music in the background

The service is always excellent, speedy and attentive. 

The food is excellent.  I would highly recommend their giant meatball dish it's perfectly flavoured served in a delicious rich tomato sauce. I've also tried their arancini which is also very flavoursome.

I've tried a few mains but I enjoy their pork tenderloin as one of my favourites. Now you have to order separate sides and the garlic rapini and sweet potato mash are both excellent. They also have daily specials and I've tried their lobster fettuccini which was amazing, except he lobster claws which I had to crack open and were a but fussy. They also have a good selection of wines.

Overall this is one of my favorite restaurants in the area! Give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Come in for a romantic Italian dinner in the lights or a bright brunch exploring the wild memorabilia in there. Also, give their Mona Lisa cocktail a try!
A bite from our full experience review - 
\"A tender and soft freshly made crespelle pasta wrapped the butternut squash paste - creating a fresh pasta almost ravioli like. We ordered a small dish which came with two large ravioli and plenty of sage butter creamy sauce. A beautifully fresh and flavorful dish.\""}
{"text":"How can you not try a place that calls itself a really, really nice restaurant, serving tapas and hot dogs?  Right?  We sniffed it out, and the scent was just what our olfactory glands were seeking.  

It's not a \"mis-nose-mer\" - this place is really, really nice.  It's funky, it's hip, and you enter under, yes, a big nose.  

The bread is soft and distinctly bread-like, and the balsamic was quite pungent and bold, we loved it.  We had the olives to go along with our reasonably-priced bottle of wine, and settled on the pork belly and scallop appetizer.  The scallops - seared right on the nose, were swimming in a nice sauce.  I was torn between the short ribs and grassfed rib-eye, and our server recommended the rib-eye.  She was not wrong.  It was cooked perfectly, seared nicely, seasoned to my liking, and liberally sauced in a delightful mushroom jus.  My husband had the involtini, pulled pork wrapped in steak - you've got to be kidding me - it was out of this world!  We weren't in the dessert mood, but had some coffee, and a double-espresso with whipped cream for me, very well done.  

Follow your senses!"}
{"text":"I give this place 4 star because of the coziness of the place combined with decent good food. There is nothing fancy about this place but there is lot of great art on walls. the tables are very close to each other. it is noisy in a acceptable level. food is like homemade. nothing fancy but taste good and looks fresh and healthy, you need to order side dish like salad since the main dish is really just the main. and that is what I think keeps it good. cause they keep it simple therefore fast and free of mistakes. I liked how people are mixed in this place, artists, famillies, young and old professionals and pretty much a mirror of the neighborhood.  trustable food in a cozy European looking atmosphere. I liked it and i think I will go back. I liked the fact that the waiters were not in black uniforms.
I orderd ossobuco and some aregula salad. both tasted good, not salty ( not salty is a key factor for me) and not loud on garlic and herbes undertone. ( you know what I mean? some Italian places try to cover up every thing with garlic, that was not the case with this place). Oh! and as I said make sure to role your eye around and give you eyes some food as well as your mouth since they have plenty of art works on the walls and they sell them too. dont let that big nose hanged outside fool you. it is a nice place."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a belated birthday dinner at Gio Rana's. We arrived at seven o'clock on a Saturday night and this little Leslieville restaurant was packed. They don't take reservations for parties under six so expect some waiting time. 

I love the decor of Gio Rana's - for an Italian restaurant, they're going for a Bohemian chic look. It's a small space so you'll be sitting closely to other patrons. Easily accessible by TTC, you can also find street parking. One block east of Gio's, you can find free parking after six o'clock on Queen Street. Now to the food. We ordered rissotto balls (arancini) floating on tomato sauce. Perfectly cheesy and crispy. We also ordered pasta; I unfortunately forgot its name (it starts with a 'c',' dumplings in sage butter with butternut squash inside). The pasta was a-okay, it was a little bland. We also ordered the chicken dish, which was juicy and seasoned well.

Service was excellent, food was delicious, and the ambiance was great.

PS - It's a little expensive (2 glasses of wine, 1 app, 1 pasta, and 2 mains was $85), but worth it!

Good for: Italian, dinner"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  4 stars?  Almost.  Read on, and you decide.  
  I popped into this joint this past Friday night.  It was on the earlier side, so my companion and I were quickly seated at a tiny table set for two.  Bread quickly followed, along with our menus.  Excellent.
  Looking around while stuffing pillowy soft bits of bread in my face, I thought, wow, this is really soft bread.  And then, this place is a bit strange in decor department. Someone far more polite than I would refer to it as \"eclectic\".   I say weird.  It's weird.  And I'm ok with it.  The walls were lacking paint, the bits left over, peeling worn.  The paintings adorning said walls lack cohesion.  And in a matching mismatched manner, the staff are as casual and varied as the decor.  
  However, it was a great time.  The service was great.  Food was tasty- the Sam's meatball was fantastic, if not a surprise, presenting as one singular giant meatball.  Mystical, almost.  The carpaccio was equally as good and comes with a tidy recommendation, courtesy of yours truly.  The risotto left a bit to be desired, but having said, the food I did sample left me wanting to return and try out the other offerings.  
  This place is lively, upbeat, and fun.  Yes, loud, it is, but the noise adds to the energy of the room.  The staff* were friendly and appeared to enjoy the gig, which makes for a great atmosphere, of which, I'll add, was quite hopping when I departed.  I'll be back.  This time, with freinds.  
  

* The bartender there is a fox.  Hi there."}
{"text":"2nd highest rated restaurant on Yelp?  Is this a joke?  This place gets 3.5 Stars from me, which I hope will help drive down the ridiculous rating!  Here's why it gets 3.5:

+++PROS+++
1. For the type of food, the prices are good
2. The service is excellent.  They handled our group of 20 or so Yelpers as smoothly as they could have.
3. Lots on the menu, plenty of options for all, even those annoying vegetarian friends.

---CONS---
1. If you're going to call yourself a \"Really Really Nice Restaurant\", you may want to invest in things like, paint on the walls, a janitor to clean your bathroom, etc.
2. The most important thing, the food, simply wasn't that great.  Just good, not really or really really good.  I had the scallops+pork belly, gnocchi, and lamb chops.  The gnocchi was the best of the bunch. 

To be perfectly honest, there's too many good restaurants in Toronto for Gio Rana's to be a destination location for me.  The high Yelp rating and great expectations don't help either.  Overall, I liked it and would return, it is just not up to the rating or hype, and not in an area I would go out of my way to have a meal."}
{"text":"Great food. Ordered the entire appetizer menu. Simple honest Italian with some French and Spanish flavours. Service was a superb. Experienced knowledgable staff. The receptionist/hostess was exceptional. Super friendly and loves her job. Ambiance is very casual. They didn't invest in decor, that's for sure, but the buzz is terrific with a good crowd of all ages. It was 90% full until 10:30. Still able to get a last minute res but I'd call ahead just in case. 5 stars."}
{"text":"I'm not a frequenter of Queen East, mainly because I don't really know what's around there but this restaurant has been on my radar since someone told me the story of the famed papier maché nose, which completely intrigued me. 

Finally I got to eat here, although it was a sad occasion (Deanna's departure) it was great to meet up with so many people and just have a great time. Since we were a large party (18 in total), dishes obviously took a little longer to prepare but service remained excellent. 

I was one of the first to arrive and when seated with only 2 others our server came by a few times to ask us if we needed anything or wanted to take drink orders, she made sure our pitchers of water were filled and that we were all set. 

I loved the rustic decor. It was a little dark to see but I noticed the mismatched chairs and the bar stools and tables and the antique wooden buffet that was used as the server station. There is also a \"vault\" in which a party of max. 10 people would be able to enjoy. 

The food was great. Not spectacular but great. I didn't choose anything that was too adventurous to solidify my claim of good food. Scotty's meatball was sub par, it wasn't too special and tasted like there was not enough meat and too much filler. The rigatoni with tomato and basil was really good but don't bother getting the entree size at $14, opt for the appetizer which is half the size for is $7 and the entree size isn't even that big. 

I also tried the fried calamari and it was good, nothing special but it did come with shrimp as well which is always a bonus. I also had the creseulla, some name of that sort which is stuffed pastry with sweet potato and herbs, amazing! It's really good. When I come back, yes I said when, I will be having that for sure! 

Bathrooms are not the typical scary Toronto bathroom but only in the sense that they aren't in the basement. Is it that difficult to put a little bit of money into the nasty rundown bathrooms? Bathrooms are what I deem to be the difference between a nice hotel and a crappy motel, so why do I not have the same rating system for restaurants? Because it's a known fact that Toronto has the grossest bathrooms around. 

I would definitely come back here, regardless of the bathroom situation, it's got a great feel and decent looking servers (re: Kat F's comment of the David Arquette lookalike named Joshua or Joseph) and everyone is laid back and super unpretentious which is a nice change from the stuff I'm used to every day. 

Good food, good friends...what could be better?"}
{"text":"Had a gift certificate here, so figured we'd give it a go.

After the meal was said and done, couldn't really remember what I ate.  The only thing that stood out was the pesto on the buffalo mozzarella appy.  

Overall - food is rather forgettable, the music WAY too loud, and atmosphere wise it's more of a place to grab a quick meal rather than a romantic place to go with your significant other.   

Meal cost $150 with tip, including bottle of wine.  We were relatively full, but overall wouldn't go back.  For that kind of money, would've expected more memorable food."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for 8 years and the menu has not changed in 8 years. The food is good, a little pricy for the portion size however it is good food. Wine list is alright and waIt staff are courteous and prompt. To the owners if you read your reviews....spice up the menu, it's time.  I'll come back when there's a dish I haven't had 3 times already."}
{"text":"I've rarely had \"great\" meals in Toronto. Many good ones, just not great. Gio's Rana's really put together a top notch dining experience. It was a cold winter night, people were packed in, side-by-side tables, the ambiance was very cozy. An interesting mix of casual hipsters and well-heeled diners. 

Of note, this place is busy and there is a constant clamour for seats, people waiting at the bar, walk-ins etc. The previous reviews of poor service or waiting is likely a result of the volume. I got a bird-eye's view of the door from our table and just too many people to please, several who were fairly rude, entitled and demanding. Hopefully, those people don't become regulars. This place is inviting and many people often sit and enjoy a bottle of wine well after their meal so that makes seating a nightmare.

So why do people flock here? Clearly, the food. A great menu which accommodates many different appetites. It is Italian, but not pasta-heavy. Highlights of a few because they don't have a menu on-line.

Starters

Scotty's Meatball -  A single, large, well-textured meatball served with a delicious tomato-sauce - great for sharing, solid.

Scallops-/Pork Belly - Scallops done to perfection - hard to find these days, just tender and cooked through to center. Pork belly was a bit of an afterthought but also tender.

Crespelle - Italian crepe, filled with butternut squash puree, cream and sage - amazing, satiny and creamy, just a wonderful dish, we ordered a second for our late arriving guest

Pasta della settimana - \"pasta of the week\", Linguine al dente with roasted peppers - perfect, an amazing bite and nice complementary size to your entrees.

Entrees

Osso-bucco - hearty, fall of the bone and satisfying

Involutini - shredded pork stuff inside a rib-eye, distinct, flaky and meaty, nice compliment to the pasta

Slow-cooked short ribs - Again, fall of the bone goodness, infused with flavour and a large portion.

Tiramisu - cool, light, chocolatey goodness

This place doesn't have a website I could locate and perhaps that's better for the mystery but you'd be remiss not to come here for a great meal - food is top-notch for the price point, service is efficient and accommodating to those who are gracious, a great atmosphere and overall, one of the better dining experiences in Toronto."}
{"text":"Who are we trying to deafen with the EXTREMELY loud music? Returned after a ten year absence to find they had expanded into the old bank building next door, still the same concrete floors and decor by Goodwill, although the chandeliers must have been a secret Good Will find, the christmas fairy lights only get one star for amusement. Tables for four couldn't possibly hold plates for 4 comfortably, are the management suggesting we order LESS? Kitchen is getting lazy, obviously never heard of gremolata to be served with Osso Bucco. Too much untrimmed fat before braising, which obviously didn't happen today. Too many dishes were just cooked once in a while and reheated. Desserts incredibly over priced for what's involved. Definitely gonna blow The Nose!"}
{"text":"If I had to list my favorite things in the world Italian food would be at the top, and commitment would be at the bottom.

These are two of the reasons I love The Nose . Savory dishes are served in small tapas-like servings  for smallish tapas like prices. No need to commit to a big bowl of pasta which arrives served after you fill up on bread. Lively pastas, tender fish, and rich risotto are all served briskly on small plates. Instead of lusting  after your neighbor's dish you can just order one of your own.  If you crave vegetables you can order those as well. Or, dinner can just be a bottle of Pinot Grigio and a meatball.

Sitting at a table scares me  - too much of a commitment - so we always choose the bar instead. There we can start with a killer French Martini, then move on to a plate of exceptional Fritto Misto, usually followed by another plate of Fritto Misto and whatever happens to strike our fancy that day.

Around us the crowd is always raucous. It's a happy party,  which is fine for some, particularly those who like the volume somewhere between loud and deafening. I don't, which is another reason why the bar is so attractive. 

Gio's is our local, and there've been many nights we've closed the bar -  which is what happens when the bartender asks if I'm  done, and the  answer is  \"Yes. Maybe. No. Not done.  More, please.\""}
{"text":"I heard a lot about this place from my fellow yelpers so what else would i do than try it out?  i took my gf and dad here Sunday night and i was very impressed with the quality of food, service, and atmosphere.  You guys weren't kidding that they don't have a sign but instead a nose, a really big nose lol

The service was very good.  He was waiting about 6 or 7 tables at a time and was on top of everyone to make sure glasses were full of water or that we had everything we needed.  top notch.

atmosphere was great because you could talk and talk loud and no one can ease drop on any convos.  i tried and i couldn't get a word from any other table lol ( i was only testing to see if i could haha)

we walked in and were greeted and seated right away.  we ordered the risotto balls, grilled calamari, and scallops with pork belly (my fav) for our apps.  everything was delicious and cooked perfectly.  the calamari was nice and tender, risotto balls cripsy on the outside and soft inside and the scallops were cooked perfectly but the  winner was the pork belly.  it was very cripsy and salty and complimented the sweetness of the scallops.  YUM!

for our primi we ordered the risotto with sausage ragu, spaghetti, and gnocchi.  here is where it gets interesting.  my gf asked to have linguine instead of spaghetti but when we got it they gave us spaghetti.  more about this later because it gets spicy in a good way.  Moving on, just like the apps these were amazingly good.  the gnocchi had that homemade look to it because it was rolled out and cut instead of the how you usually see it packaged (sort of like a gnudi instead of gnocchi).  the spaghetti was perfectly cooked but the tomato sauce was out of this world.  i was scooping the rest of the sauce after i was done haha.  

secondi- this was the best part for me.  we ordered the braised beef ribs, salmon, and cod.  i didn't try the fish but my ribs were ridiculously good! the meat fell off the bone and the meat was infused with so much taste i couldn't stop and wanted more.  ahhh i want more now!!!

ok back to the spicy part where they gave us spaghetti instead of linguine.  the server gave me the bill and informed me that he removed the spaghetti off the bill for the mistake. i was amazed because usually you do not see that especially when i said \"it's fine no problem, no need to take it back\". that made the rest of my night cause that just took it to another level.  i will be back and soon for sure.  

Thanks Gio Rana!!"}
{"text":"This is one of many fantastic restaurants in Leslieville. Modern, unpretentious decor, high energy crowds. Portion sizes are perfect. The service was great - polite and thoughtful, but never overbearing. As for the food, it was consistently excellent. The Sexier Duck Leg (that's what it's called on the menu) is a moist duck leg with crispy skin, served on a traditional beans and tomatoes sauce with olives and lemon. Hard to describe properly, but many people call it 'peasant food'.  It's the kind of menu where I want to keep coming back because so many dishes look so good.

Go!"}
{"text":"Two & a half stars.  

Gio Rana's is one of those restaurants that if you ever ventured into during daylight hours you'd run screaming from the place. It is a night time only dining adventure for this spot. Daylight hides a lot of dingy walls and even grubbier ceilings that are badly in need of washing, painting and just general updating.  This is a Restaurant Makeover waiting to happen.  

I'm probably one of the few Yelpers (besides Neil...great minds think alike!) that give Gio's the \"meh\" factor. While it is a great spot in that we needed something to accommodate our large group to bid adieu to our beloved Deanna, my sister FARC and charcuterian loving kindred spirit,  but that is pretty much about where it ended for me. 

Being situated along the perimeter of the kitchen was geographically a nightmare for those who sat with their back to the rushing waitstaff. Getting whacked in the back, nudged in the noggin and stepped on doesn't make for a fun dining experience.  But hey, they gotta pack 'em while they can because the resto business is a tough go these days.  WTF is up with those greasy, filthy menu covers?  People we are in the middle of germ-o-phobia days what with H1N1 going on.  Just holding on to that menu made me want to get out my sanitizer and give it a washing over.  

Anyway, Dea and I opted to share as we usually do. We ordered up the Crespelle, some Rigatoni (app sizes) to start and then would follow it with a beef rib shank and some shredded brussel sprout salad. Ok...everyone's talking about the fab-u-less-ness of the staff. We got no apps. While everyone else was chowing down on their openers we got nothing. It all showed up at once when the mains got served. The Crespelle was cold and sort of slimy. The Rigatoni was steaming hot and for me was actually the best of what was served. The beef rib/shank was ok. Braising its a chef's easy way out. It's no fail but I found the meat to be stringy and especially fatty.  There wasn't much flavour factor going on there either.   I did feel the love for the Brussel Sprout salad though, crispy, no dressing glommed on. What about the bread on the tables? This restaurant has a ton of amazing bakeries around (Brick Street being one of them) and they serve up bread that reminds me of the subs used at Mr. Sub.  So sad.  

The best thing I tasted all night was Danielle's sweet potato mash. She was sitting next to me and her and Abby were making orgasmic moans so I caved and gave it a taste. I should have just ordered up a plate of those and been done with it. 

Would I go back? Nah. I'd be willing to spend a few more bucks and head east and hit up Tomi-Kro's instead. A much wiser choice for spending my hard earned bucks and unlikely that I'll get tackled by waitstaff.  At least handling the menus doesn't want to have me running for the washroom to scrub my digits.  

In the end though, we came to celebrate a legend Yelper, Deanna.  Lucky girl has now moved on to Yelping in one of the best food cities in the world....NYC.  Hey Dea....I'm waiting for Boba.  :)"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited about this place after hearing all the positive reviews on yelp. And while it wasn't terrible, I was a little disappointed. None of the food I ate really screamed WOW and I'm not even a serious foodie. Like Grant C., maybe I just came on a wrong day or ordered the wrong thing. 

One thing that I did like was that even though I ordered 3 courses, I didn't leave the restaurant feeling stuffed to the gills. I'm probably going to come back and give it another try (just because the reviews are so positive)."}
{"text":"Was here last night for NYE ~ table for 8.  It was absolutely delish (again).  The menu was great, the first 2 courses were bite sized portions of the most delicious things they have on their menu every day, and the we had a choice of 6 mains (I think).  I had the rack of lamb (yum).  One of my fave things is the butternut squash crepe.

It was tasty, and left me wanted to come back for more!"}
{"text":"This one is a tough one.  The food here is excellent.  I've had their pasta, pizza, shrimp, rice balls and a few other things and I enjoyed all of it.  The people that go here I do not enjoy.  Loud and pretentious is an understatement.  All think that their feces smell like Chanel No. 5.  I need to tune out of the conversations here or I will go mental.  I do not recommend eaves dropping here if you are a normal person.  The conversations will ruin your meal.  So put on your invisible tune out ear phones.  The safe in the back is cool to stare at for 15 seconds.
But the food is good and it was always cooked perfectly so 4 stars it is."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try this restaurant but it is quite east from the downtown core area so it isn't as convenient for me. However, I finally decided to make the trip to come to this area to try this place. I am glad I came !

Me and a friend shared:
Antipasti: Caramelized fig, prosciutto, and arugula. The portion was really small. It was great but I wished they gave more prosciutto.
Primi: Butternut squash stuffed crespelle in a butter sauce (large). This was really buttery so it's great for anyone who looks butter. The large portion only comes with 3 pieces, so I recommend the large size if it is for sharing.
Secondi: Braised veal osso buco. This is a MUST get! The meat is sooo tender and tasty. The flavor is very rich. This was the best dish out of the three we ordered. 

Overall, I love the ambience. Service was great. Food is awesome. Will return to try more items in the future."}
{"text":"for the buffs out there:  remember this american express commercial, say 15 or so years ago with some italian guy with a big nose who was a chef/restaurant owner blabbing about the greatness of amex?  that was gio rana i believe and his restaurant, which at the time i think was called something just like gio rana's  was somewhere around yonge and eglinton area;  outside the front of that restaurant sat, above the entrance, an enormous paper mache like nose.  gio's nose.  which then, of course, caused the affectionate moniker of \"the nose\" to be born.  thats what i call it and i must have heard it somewhere because i didnt invent it.  

so somewhere along the way he moved his place to leslieville.  thank the lord in heaven for that.  now just close your eyes and imagine me in your ear making lickety split slurpy lip smacking drooling sounds and let that serve as a background soundtrack to the following, because those sounds are all you will be able to utter once youve eaten here.

now im so shitty at remembering the exact  food i had, but after reading another review of this place, i did recall  the speechlessness i had when i also had the pork belly and scallop app.  perhaps ill add to this review in the future, but feel free to write me hate messages if you go there and the food is nothing short of brilliant.  i know that wont happen.

it is an elegant place but elegant with wood no frou frou (thats the way im going to spell that spellcheck or not).  feel free to gab and gab and giggle your way through your meal.  we eat and talk here like you were sitting at your mamas table. 

(i think i know where i want to go for my birthday this year)"}
{"text":"so this was my choice of restaurant for my birthday dinner w a few close friends . i had no idea what to expect .

it was loud . but in a good way . service was amazing and sooo patient considering that half of our party was about half an hr late AND it was extremely busy . they didnt give us a hard time about bringing our own cake either . no cutting fee ! if this review was solely based on service, they deserve 4 stars .

we went in a group so we were able to try few dishes;
for appetizer, we had scotty's meatball which i thought was okay and my bf absolutely LOVED . he kept on saying this is how a meatball should be . i also got to try their grilled calamari, grilled to perfection ! not too chewy, but not raw, & flavorful . now this, was exactly how it should be . 
for pasta, i had the crespelle w roasted butternut squash . YUM ! the butternut squash filling was sweet, smooth & sooo good ! but the portion was tiny . boooo .
for main entree, i had the shredded pork wrapped w ribeye & goat cheese which was interesting, but again, i thought it was pretty mediocre yet my bf LOVED . however, the portion was tiny . 3 of them, about 1 1/2 thumb size each . the bf had the braised beef ribs . portion was a LOT bigger and it was ... omg heavenly . the meat was so tender, it just fell off the bone . so flavorful . as for the side dishes, we had sweet potato mash & asparagus . nothing to write home about .

so in conclusion, lots of mediocre dishes and some really good ones, but a lot were tiny portion . if my bf was writing this review, he'd prob give it a 4 . but this is not his review, its mine . so 3 it is ."}
{"text":"AMAZING big meatball -- holy smokes, one of the best I've ever eaten and I'm a) married to an Italian and b) I'm a darn good meatball sauce cook and c) see a) and b) again.  

We ordered nearly everything off the menu.  I apologize that this is very vague, and my memory not up to snuff, but from what I do recall, everything we did order was so delicious, really fresh, priced extremely reasonably well, and we plan to go there again and again and again.  Just go EARLY so you can talk to one another in normal voices -- the later the evening gets, the louder the ambiance and you wind up having to scream at the person next to you to be heard."}
{"text":"Well when you leave a pub on Paddy's day and expect to get in at another one closer to home, I guess that's how you end up eating at an Italian restaurant.  No green wine?  WTF! 

So Gio's is the kind of place you can rely on as an old standby.  We've lived in Leslieville since 2005, so have had the opportunity to watch the hood evolve.   Gio's, however, doesn't seem to have changed at all - the daily special is still the same it was long ago: whole seabass.   The rest of the menu is a virtual carbon copy of the original also.  At least they must save on photocopying.

Don't miss:
 - crespelle: it's delish
 
Can't lose:
 - brussel sprouts: maybe Tomi-kro executes it better, but it's pretty good
 - Scotty's meatball: a big meatball in red sauce
 - Service: all the servers are high-energy and excellent"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to go here for years, just because I remember seeing this restaurant as a kid, and I was craving \"Italian food\".

Our server was good and kind.

The food was a huge let down in terms of flavour and being Italian.
2 of the popular options (osso-bucco and the mushroom \"ravioli\") were not available.

The Gorgonzola Fig was a huge let down, gave the impression it would be a bunch of small figs stuffed with gorgonzola and wrapped in prosciutto. Basically it was 1 piece of a small fig with a quarter oz of cheese and like 5 pieces of prosciutto around it.

Carbonara was so bland, undercooked onions, pancetta wasn't nice and crispy, no flavour. On top of that, clearly it was boxed pasta (not fresh),
Should have figured from the hundreds of boxed pasta around the kitchen. 

This restaurant seems to only be popular with the locals, as every other person that came into the restaurant, the owner/manager seemed to be kissing them on the cheek, and providing them with special attention. 


The only great thing about this restaurant were the paintings."}
{"text":"Gios is a very cute restaurant, has lots of character, the story of the restaurant is a classic, the staff are all amazing & the food is to die for! 

Been a few times and haven't had a bad experience with food yet. And the atmosphere is lovely as long as you get there before it's too packed especially on a weekend- be sure to go a little early so it's not full."}
{"text":"Not sure why it has such high reviews - the food was decent, but nothing out of the ordinary. They have a nice private area for parties."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner a few weeks ago on a Friday night and it was extremely busy with a good relaxed neighborhood vibe.  Food was mixed, we shared two appetizers, one was a giant meatball which was ok,  nothing special, similar to a Martha Stewart recipe. Second app was a red pepper spread on flat bread which was quite standard as well.  For mains, my husband had the risotto which was absolutely TERRIBLE! Can't believed they served it, it was uncooked rice. I had the seafood linguine which had absolutely no flavours.  My friend had pulled pork wrapped with bacon which was very delicious and the pulled pork was nice and soft.  It's a good spot if you order the right items on the menu. Price was quite reasonable: 2 apps, 3 mains, 2 deserts, 2 bottles of wine, taxes and tips came up to $200."}
{"text":"I came here with a large group for a birthday celebration and was seated in the private back room. It was a nice, square setup that I could definitely recommend for group gatherings. The food was served family-style with a fixed menu, which was just okay for the price and quality. I had heard good things about the restaurant but was somewhat disappointed on its delivery. It may have been the fact we were limited by our choices in our groups, but the food was not all that impressive.

I did, however, very much enjoy the hip decor (the chandelier is a standout piece) and the company, so I cannot say I had a bad time. I just wish the food matched the surroundings."}

Eat here.  You will like it.  Trust me."}
{"text":"I came here for a friends birthday. We reserved a private room and the birthday celebrant ordered an array of dishes from the menu. Food was AMAZING.

Served fresh and timely, you can tell the food was homemade and with quality. The meatballs, calamari, vegetables, fresh pasta and lamb were all to die for. 

Our hostess was polite and very attentive to our needs. Unlike some places, they do separate bills. It may seem like a hassle and to some, a little unorthodox, but they to accept separate bills. Wine menu is pleasant, and the drinks are typical of any restaurant. 

Atmosphere is dim and relaxing, however, some of the paintings on the wall were a little disturbing for my liking. The music they played was dope, but a little weird for the overall restaurant setting. There was an abundance of Biggie Smalls and Tupac, but did not expect it from a restaurant such as this. Overall a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Ate here last night and I was impressed! Great atmosphere, friendly/funny service, yummy food, and well priced too. 

I was happy to sample the following:

Scallops - cooked well, light with semi-sweet sauce
Rapini - seasoned great to reduce the natural bitterness
Steak - perfectly medium rare
Risotto - loaded with seafood in a yummy tomato based sauce
Arctic char - nicely cooked in parchment paper (don't eat the paper!!)
Ravioli - giant, tender, buttery.... want some right now

Dessert, had the lemon and berry cheesecake.

I definitely recommend this place. Suitable for a party or a fun date."}
{"text":"I really really love this place. See what I did there? And kid you not, I have tried everything on the menu. It's tucked away on Queen east and bears no name - just a big old nose. How iconic. The insides have this rustic fine dining decor. It's fancy and unfancy all at the same time. 

If you're in a group, the wine cellar seating is great. If you're not in a group, don't be surprised if they squeeze you into a little space from where you can touch the next patron at the restaurant. Such is life at The Nose. 

The servers are much older, definitely polite and have a great know-how of the menu. As for the menu, it's small and in a few visits, you can definitely try it all. The prices, I find, are very reasonable for Toronto fare. So I am not sure why The Nose is $$$ on Yelp.

Lastly, the gnocchi is a must try. Delish. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Now I know what the Nose knows - that a weird sign isn't always an indication of food quality. The outside of this \"really nice restaurant\" reads more like an abandoned art gallery, with the very odd nose on front,  totally dark interior and graffiti on the brick walls. There's a reason why \"it's what's on the inside that matters\" has become a cliché. The food here is fantastic and the servers are all very friendly, not snobby at all. 
Although they don't take reservations, we walked in around 9pm and got a table for two immediately.
We opted to share plates and ordered just the right amount. The Risotto Balls were both our faves for the night. Crunchy outside with creamy filling, and sweet and acidic tomato sauce made this the most balanced dish. The giant Meatball lives up. It tastes good, but we agreed it was too big for one person to eat alone. I also like my burgers well done, so find the medium cook a bit of a put off, but very juicy and probably the best value.
The squash crispelle was really delicious. I loved the sage butter sauce, but again, it was just sweet, salt and cream, missing some fresh herbs and acid so it was great as a dish to share, but again, not balanced enough for a full meal. Finally, we had the crispy chicken. It was crispy and moist inside, but the tapenade added salt on salt. I used my sage-butter sauce on the chicken and THAT was stellar, crispy, creamy, sweet, salty - that was a perfect bite that should be on the menu. 
$40 for food (with no leftovers) plus tax and tip is a bit pricey for food-only, but our noses and mouths agreed, the Nose is a good place to go."}
{"text":"Went there and had the ossobuco (veal) and risotto with italian sausages and was very disappointed with the lack of flavour. The meat was tender but bland. I wouldn't go back and I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone else."}
{"text":"Went here last night for a birthday treat.  If I were rating the food and the friendliness of the service only, it would get five stars.  Unfortunately it suffers from some ambiance and presentation issues.

Carpaccio was not a huge portion but the quality and flavour was excellent.  The baked cod with fennel and tomatoes was out of this world and the cooking en papillote caused the fennel flavour to infuse the fish.
Side orders of mushrooms, green beans and potatoes were all winners as was my partner's ribs cooked in wine.  Great bread and good desserts.

The old bank location would be cute but the \"under construction\" decor just doesn't make it.  We sat in the side room which includes a faux balcony with  naked mannequins and a toilet - items that seemed a bit weird for a restaurant.   Additionally, my fish was served in the paper it was baked in leaving me to unceremoniously tear it and dump it on my plate - it should have been removed by the server.

Another issue is the high noise level, which is fine for people seeking a lively venue, but does not make for good dining conversation."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the food, service, and venue. Booked for a birthday party, eleven (11) of us were squeezed into the private wine cellar room at the rear of the restaurant. It was definitely tight to get out of your seat and move around the cellar, but once seated the table was more than spacious. This is a great little private space, and the noise concerns noted in other reviews don't apply here.

We ordered a number of antipasti, and asked for enough to share on platters family-style: 

bruschetta (toppings change weekly)
arancini - fried risotto balls
mozzarella and tomato w/ basil pesto
fig w/ prosciutto, gorgonzola & pistachio
scotty's meatball in ragu sauce
fritto misto - fried calamari and shrimp

They were all tremendous, and I can't say I was disappointed with any of them. The meatballs were amusingly large, and everything was well prepared and delicious. Plenty of bread (and at least three varieties) was provided.

I started with the crespelle (Italian crêpes) with roasted butternut squash & sage butter. I can't say I loved it; it could have used more salt or more parmesan, as I found it tasted fairly flat. Okay if you're looking for subtler flavours.

The ossobuco was much more impressive. I was surprised to see it priced so cheaply at $13.95, but this reflects the presence of only one hunk of bone (from whence the marrow flows). The meat was tender and well-seasoned.

My partner ordered the involtini (shredded pork wrapped with rib eye), and it was a very pathetic looking dish - three little sad lumps of meat. The flavour was okay with assistance from the goat cheese, but I found the texture of the meat made the dish even less appetizing.

None of the secondi come with sides, but again we ordered platters to share. The coleslaw and new potatoes were the standouts.

No dessert as we brought our own cake, and they served it up without any hassle. Plenty of chianti kept us well lubricated throughout the evening.

Overall a fantastic meal!"}
{"text":"We went for a surprise engagement party with a group of appx 20 that occupied the whole side room.

We arrived at 8pm and the music was louder than many clubs... It was difficult to speak to the person 3 inches away from me. 

Service was disappointing at best. It seemed that they were going to take good care of us.  Our drink orders were taken, and each diner was seemingly carefully documented. One guy in our party asked 4 separate times for his drink and it still took over an hour.  Despite being in the restaurant for over 3 hours, we were never offered another drink.  Then when food was finally delivered, it was served in the always maddening \"ok who ordered the mozzarella?! Anyone?\" Style. I mean, come on, we can barely hear you, 2 tables and you couldn't keep track of at least which table?

Ultimately yeah the 4 small plates we ordered were good, and we can give them a partial mulligan on the service but we weren't terribly impressed with the atmosphere or service."}
{"text":"Great food. We had a very nice time on Valentine's day. We would go back for sure."}
{"text":"(More like 3.5)

Marked solely by a giant nose on the outside is a tapas restaurant with fantastic atmosphere, good food for a reasonable price and even better service. 

My friend & I ordered the scallops with the pork belly, beef carpaccio, risotto balls and the prosciutto wrapped figs. We also got sides of sweet potato mash & rapini.
I had such high hopes for the scallops which is why, perhaps, I was slightly disappointed: the serving comes with 2 scallops and a piece of pork belly. My scallop was on the chewy side but, even more disappointing was that the pork belly was lean and oversalted. I have a feeling that I would have enjoyed this dish more had I not expected the world of it.The risotto balls were bland, though well cooked and had a nice texture.
The beef carpaccio was fantastic! But by far my favourite dish has to be the prosciutto-wrapped figs: just the right amount of sweet and salty; delicious! The sweet potato mash was a nice surprise, served with brown butter and sage, while I found the rapini to be a little on the bitter side and could have done perhaps with a little more flavour. 
We had the cheese plate for dessert and were disappointed that there were only 2 types of cheese.

What really sets this restaurant apart, however, is the amazing service we received. Our water glasses were never empty, our server checked up on us several times, was extremely friendly and helpful... even the busboy was a treat! He was friendly, upbeat & cleared our tables quickly and efficiently. 

There are other things on the menu I'd like to try, so will definitely be back again. Great place for dates :)"}
{"text":"I love the idea of this place - fresh rustic food - good ingredients.  However, I have been a few times - and find that it's actually lacking a bit when it comes to flavour.  For 8.99 you get a big meatball - which to be honest is a bit on the expensive side - and it was in definate need of seasoning.  The asiago and brussle sprout slaw lacks acidity - which means after a few bites of it - it becomes a lit flat.  The special salad was a huge disappointment (white bean with frisee..) - really underwhelming.   The chicken main was really amazing - perfectly cooked and seasoned - really delicious.  The squid was ok - nothing to remember and not overly enjoyable.

It's an okay spot, loud with a furious pace (we were in and out in an hour)."}
{"text":"Just went to this fun restaurant last night, have lived in the beach for six years can't believe I am only discovering this place now!
We only had to wait 20 minutes for a table,  which I though was pretty reasonable considering how busy the place was.
If you are looking for quiet this isn't the place for you, on the high ceilings are an assortment of speakers playing great music that makes you want to dance in your seat (and some did!) and the place is crowded with cool interesting people being waited on by cute young waiters (an added bonus). 
The food was very tasty and well prepared and the service was great (again considering how busy it is!).
The menu has a great variety with lots of seafood choices, this place is a must if your looking for a fun night out, enjoy!"}
{"text":"Had a pre-party dinner with a few of my closets friends in the vault.  As usual, the food was excellent, the service was outstanding (and easy on the eyes, I love that waiter!) and totally reasonably priced.  And I finally took the fish plunge - ordered the Haddock and didn't regret it.  This would seem normal for most people, except I pretty much loathe fish.  I never eat it, every time I order it I can't choke it down - except here - is is wonderful, fresh, and tender!

If you can squeeze a group into the vault I'd highly recommend it!  Big Nose, I love you."}
{"text":"The more I think about it, the more I realize that this is my favorite restaurant in Toronto.

Delicious and interesting food.  A unique environment.  Wonderful service. Unrushed.  Unostentatious.  Unpretentious.   Special as can be.

Every time you go to \"The Nose\" you feel that it's a special occasion.  It doesn't matter if it's just a casual weekday meal or a celebration of your monumental promotion.   It's always just that good.     This is a place to EAT.... not just be seen.   The involtini is one of the finest dishes in the country.   The creative serving of brussel sprouts cause even the finickiest eater to dive in with both forks with reckless abandon.

Interestingly enough, whenever I end up talking to 'foodies' about good restaurants in town this place is always mentioned by someone... almost without fail.    It's that kind of place.

There's no other restaurant like it in the city.    It's not super fancy.   It's not expensive.  You can pronounce all the food on the menu.   You feel like you're in a old friend's favorite place.

This is the reason that you decided not to cook tonight."}
{"text":"Such wonderful, affordable food. Have been a couple times now. Once our server was spectacular. The last time I went, the dude was super lame and dry. Will still go back as I'm sure that dude was just having a bad day. Still tipped 15%."}
{"text":"After reading many sparkling reviews and walking past the big nose for a year, I was really excited about going. As expected a table of two without reservations on a friday took about half an hour to obtain. Unfortunately they slapped us right up against the kitchen, which made it difficult to hear what my dinner friend was saying. A waitress scuttled over in due time to take our drink orders and give us menus. My drink was delivered in a somewhat timely fashion, however the woman that brought it was not our server and auctioned off the drink. When our waitress took our orders, it took a couple of times to get her to remember what we ordered, and when I asked for a glass of wine to be served with my meal, she brought it right after I ordered it, before we even got our appetizer. In fact, I had barely taken a sip of the first drink that I ordered. The mozzeralla balls that we ordered were fairly good, although three balls and five slices of tomato seem kinda skimpy for 9 bucks. (they have increased their prices) When our mains arrived, I had ordered the sexier duck leg. The duck's outer skin was so charred that I couldn't cut into it, so I just peeled it back to get to the meat, which was super dry and impressively tasteless. The sauce that they poured all over the dish was also curiously devoid of flavour. The garlic mash potatoes that came with it were lumpy, dry and watery all at once, without an inkling of garlic. I decided that maybe salt would help, and our server was so inattentive my friend had to go fetch her. I put about a teaspoon of coarse salt on my plate, and finally resorted to dipping my duck in the balsamic vinegar and oil that they had provided for our bread basket. There was a mouthful that I had to to wash down with wine due to the lack of moisture. We both had coffee, asked for the bill, which turned out to be around 87$. I put in 100$, and she took the billfold and never returned with the change, which was probably the first wise thing she did all night, as there was no way I was going to tip her more than 10%. So disappointed."}
{"text":"If* I had a spiritual life coach... he, in a sauna, would tell me: be sure she has a nose for wherever you roam. Thankfully, she does -- especially for Toronto. For once, I let go of all choices for the week and let her sense of the city lead the way, and I was thankful for all the stops along the way -- especially here. I thank the giant snout out front for making me feel okay about my own over sized triangle. 

More places like this should exist. It's unpretentious. It's lively. It's affordable. And it's enough off-kilter to throw everyone off: it's a loud music, bar vibe italian comfort new menu restaurant in a former bank. 

The menu has all the comfort trimmings you need, and then there's the pulled pork wrapped in rib eye. Excuse me? That's just a damn strange thing to do. They came out like little bullets of as much meat as you can fit in the size of a fingerling. While they're bold flavored, and this is going to come off as a wooly mammoth of a statement... they're more of an appetizer than a meal. Thus, speaking of meals... Osso Bucco. There's no reason to order anything else. It's the perfect dish for this place. 

I'd be brought here by a date, which I was, I'd be brought here by family, a group of friends or for a work meeting or meal. While trends move on, The Nose remains. 

*If you have any suggestions on a SLC (is that what they go by?), I'd be down to go for a consultation visit."}
{"text":"In my fellow Yelpers I now trust! And in Leslieville I now obsess.

Gio Rana's is warm & irresistible from the moment you are greeted to the invitation to return. 

First impressions: the heady fragrance (drool-worthy), vaulted ceilings and tall windows, huge portraits, a pleasant buzz,  a diverse crowd of patrons with an artsy air. The tables are staggered in height, so even in the middle of the room you feel \"nestled\" in!

My shrimp were so pretty in pink, and so plump, I had to coo at them before I took a bite. They topped a risotto cake that was crispy on the outside, creamy on the in. My friend's ravioli stuffed with rabbit was bursting with flaky pink meat (what was with the pink tonight?), and a nearby gnocchi, I'm told, was just shy of spectacular. The grilled calamari was reminiscent of 5 Doors North (my fave), and I learned these two establishments were linked at some point. These are just a handful of the tapas-style plates, and each was an ACE!

Our server was seemingly omnipresent and picked up on subtle cues when we needed something. 

When the music went 80's-early 90's over our desert of tartufo and berries, I was BLISSED OUT!

THE NOSE, even your nostrils are nice!"}
{"text":"I feel like this place is overrated.. 
Came here with a friend couple weeks ago super small menu
Food was salty 
Service is good.. But would not go back."}
{"text":"we just popped in for a light meal tues eve....cause reliable fish/chips was closed. yep, dont ask how we got there from reliable!
got great table straight away
pro: really like this place, casual vibe, great food and good wines/cocktails
had misto calamari to share then butternut squash pasta, both delic
con: if there was one the pasta dishes are small but they are wonderful and appropriately priced so not really a prob
go to the nose"}
{"text":"Food 3.5, service 1, decor 2.  

Food.  I went with a big group so I got to try a few dishes.  The highlights were the giant meatball, and the osso bucco.  But all in all, nothing spectacular that you can't get at other italian restaurants in Toronto (minus the offensively bad service).

Service.  I came a bit later than the rest of my group and it took the waiter 45 minutes to get me a drink.  Seriously.  Then, he proceeded to bring out everyone's food at all different times, bring out wrong dishes, forget to bring drinks we ordered, and generally neglect our table.  After I complained to him and the manager, they still had the audacity to tack on the large group 18% tip.  I will never go back even if someone else is paying."}
{"text":"A very interesting and unique place is called Gio Rana's Really Really Nice Restaurant. The actual place does not have a name, just a huge Nose on the front door, which is why it's popularly called 'The Nose'. It's downtown in Leslie Ville. The restaurant hasn't spent a cent on marketing, but they were featured in an Amex commercial recently and the nose itself has made it all the way upto the Supreme Court of Canada debating on whether or not it can be considered art (some douche bag mayor found it offensive). It's so good, they rely on word of mouth.  

It's my most favourite restaurant in Toronto. 
The food is just made with lots and lots of love. 
The family that owns this place is extremely nice and interesting, with a good philosophy on life and food.

The food is mouth watering good. It's REAL Italian food, not just the commercial 'pasta'. The owners fly in their olive oil, ingredients and wines from Italy. The food is rich, and done very well. Almost everything on the menu tastes exceptional. Service is personable and on point.   

My favourites include the ossobuco and scotty's meatballs, and surprisingly the side of brussel sprouts with pancetta or the beat root and goat cheese side.  The crespelle will warm your soul and change your life. 

The place however looks strange. The location is actually an old old bank so on the inside, there is a real old fashioned safe that has been converted into a wine cellar. The interior is 'unique', and no work has actually been done. It's all really authentically old, but the reason I am telling you this, is because some ppl get put off. Trust me, the food is amazing and once you eat the food, you will get the humour and personality of the interior. It's a little pricier, just because you will want to try everything. You have to order things separately because it is proper Italian food (start with an anitipasti, follow it with little pasta , then have your main carne with ordering vegetables on the side). When I go out with my friends, we spend about $80 per head sharing all our food. Make a reservation if you can - the place is very very popular (I don't think they take them on weekends)."}
{"text":"Gio Rana's is the first restaurant I've visited based solely on Yelp reviews. While I was certainly happy with the experience I don't think this place quite lives up to the hype.

Prices are reasonable, service is excellent, the decor is a little rough around the edges, but I prefer it this way as it feels more comfortable. Also, I thought the music was great the night I came; I felt like I would have been listening to exact same songs had I been at home cooking for myself.

The food was good and sometimes great but it wasn't consistently awesome enough to warrant 5 stars. As mentioned in other reviews, Vegetarian options were good here. Our orders and thoughts:

Tomato and Avocado Salad: Okay, but much too small. The chili and pesto dressings that come with this were really tasty.
Browned Butter Mashed Sweet Potatoes: Weak. For a dish that's so simple to make at home you'd hope they would do something special with it. They didn't.

Butternut Squash Crespelle: Excellent. I'd never heard of this dish before but ordered it based on Yelp reviews and wasn't disappointed.
Gnocchi: Awesome. The highlight of the meal for me. Possibly the best gnocchi I've had in Toronto.

Brownie: Okay. Nothing to rave about.
Tartufo: Good. Not the best I've had but quite good nonetheless.

All together we walked out paying about $65 for 2 people including tax and tip.

Despite a few lacklustre dishes I'll give Gio Rana's 4 stars for the tasty mains and overall experience."}
{"text":"you have to try the pulled pork wrapped in ribeye ... it is like nothing I've ever tried before and it is absolutely delicious...I could eat 3 dishes of it and still want to order more...(so yea, the portions are a little small but you expect that walking in..no surprises there)
we ordered the first wine on the list, it was way too sweet, so if you are a wine drinker, i definitely suggest you go for something more expensive...(we chose the cheapest wine =p )
the place was completely packed on the saturday night...we had to wait for about 10 minutes to get a table...so i recommend you make reservations...
noise level is pretty high and servers are too busy to be around often enough..."}
{"text":"Really great food, but you'll pay through the nose for it.  Very loud atmosphere, apparently it's part of the charm.  Decent service, but when it's busy, expect to wait a while for your dishes."}
{"text":"Heaven heaven heaven.  I LOVED our meal here.  This place is known locally \"The Nose\"  We had a fabulous night out with another couple and ordered a bunch of things to share including many bottles of champagne.  The giant meatball is a must - so delicious!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is amazing. Super laid-back but trendy atmosphere, would be equally comfortable for a family or a casual date. It's loud, but in an acceptable and fun way. Service was friendly and efficient. 

This like a good place for people who like food and don't want to end their meal hungry! We were stuffed at the end and surprised at how reasonable the price was.  

The food was very satisfying and delicious, and the complimentary bread with olive oil and vinegar to dip was a nice addition. 

We had the brussel sprout side with cheese and bacon (my husband isn't usually a vegetable fan and loved it), the portobello mushroom slices side which were very tender and rich in garlic butter, the ricotta-stuffed salmon, and the creamy gnocchi with some kind of delicious bacon cream  sauce. (ordered the large and had a hard time finishing it, but did anyway because it was too good to not..)

Only one complaint - the food was all lukewarm when it arrived at the table, it came out super fast, but wasn't hot enough, it was acceptable, but should've been hotter. 

Looking forward to returning to try the other dishes!"}
{"text":"Making a decision off of a menu on which everything sounds good is always a challenge. That's why more traditional Italian meals are such a treat: You get to have an antipasto, a primo, and a secondo! Our server deserves a special mention for handling my \"Do you find the black cod too fennelly?\" inquiry with utmost grace. After describing the flavours and comparing it to that of my other options, she assured me that I could always let her know if I did indeed find the fennel overwhelming and would then get a new dish hassle-free. Although I thankfully did not have to exercise this option, her patience and ingenuity were most refreshing.  

We came for good food and good food was what we got. The grilled whole calamari with tomatoes and capers were delightfully plump and juicy, the triangular crespelle filled with butternut squash and sage puree swimming in cream sauce were decadently rich, and the black cod and infant's fist-sized shrimp in spicy tomato sauce were served in their wax paper steam dome and cooked to perfection. My dinner date's rack of lamb was perfectly cooked, oozing with fragrant juices from the blushing centre. The many libations on the import-heavy wine list were great accompaniments to the delicious dishes as well.
     
The decor of the large open space is an eclectic menage of classy-industrial. Intricate chandeliers and large framed art pieces are juxtaposed with unfinished walls and ceiling and exposed piping, including a vent draped with Christmas lights. To kick things up another interesting notch, there's also a Village People record sleeve and other random tidbits of 80's nostalgia tucked here and there. Following the same principle of mixing it up, the music for the night ranged from Prince to T.I., making it impossible for anyone to not sing along at some point. 

Gio Rana's was a great place for two, but judging by the looks of the larger party and constant flow of mouth-watering dishes arriving at their table next to us, size really doesn't matter."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend from out of town and my boyfriend. We found the nose amusing, and the interior decor is really quite nice and interesting. 

Service was so-so. We came in, were seated and given menus. Very soon after, the waiter comes to ask if we wanted to order wine. We did, but hadn't looked at the list yet, so we asked for another minute. We quickly decided on the wine... and the waiter didn't come back. It took flagging him twice before he came back for the wine order. By then, we'd decided on food too.

The butternut squash crespelles were fantastically good. A little salty, but I like salt. I had the salmon, which was on par with what I'd expect for salmon in a nice restaurant, but nothing exceptional. The side of sweet potato mash was not at all good - something was seriously off with the texture. I'm used to skin on sweet potatoes, so it wasn't that. It was just not good. 

The overall experience was fairly nice, but I think the crespelles were what pushed this place to a 4 star review for me. Everything else was average or below expectations."}
{"text":"As they say, the third time's a charm.  Last night I returned to Gio's and finally everything fell into place perfectly.  Perhaps it was because the place was a little emptier.  Either way our server was fantastic and kept us entertained; in fact, he even put on a juggling show worthy of the movie \"Cocktail\" for us as we were finishing up.  This time I had the grilled calamari and it was excellent.  For my main, I had the gnocchi bolognese; it was pretty simple and didn't totally wow me, but I have to say, for a rustic pasta dish it was exactly what it should be.  I didn't have dessert, but others at my table did and they claimed it was fantastic.  Five apps, six dinners, four digestifs, and three bottles of wine later, our bill came to $400.  I have to say, I think it was worth every penny."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Came here for anniversary dinner and the food was so good! Their giant meatball was amazing and so were there mains. I thought that it would be a fancy restaurant but people were pretty casual there - though it's not \"cheap\". Definitely would love to go back"}
{"text":"Holy crap, this place really IS really really nice!

I've heard about Gio Rana's via Yelp, but I thought with such a stupid name that there was no way in hell it could really be a nice place. I was wrong! (In my mind I was picturing some kind of douchy East-Side-Marios type place, but I was so off).

Was taken here by someone who is a regular, so we may have been given special treatment, but the service was excellent. 

The place was absolutely rammed (Friday night) and there was some loud but fun music. Decor is a la \"hipster/italian\". Tables are set fairly close together so the place is boisterous,if you like quiet places you will not be a fan of Gio's. 

The food here is fairly traditional Italian but served on small plates/tapas style. Most of the appetizers are $10ish and the primi and secondi (pasta and meat dishes) around $15 with $5 side dishes (veg and potatoes, etc)

We tried caprese salad, prosciutto with figs and the grilled calamari (served with capers and tomatoes! OMG) for our appetizers. I had the lamb shank (daily special) and my DC had the pork tenderloin. We had sweet potato mash and a side of beets for veg dishes. Food was all incredibly delicious and served in a very rustic Italian fashion. 

Finished off the evening with a tiramisu (yum! super boozy).

I want to go back!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've always had an awesome experience here. 
Trick is to sit at the bar! You can't beat this as a local watering hole. Staff are amazing. Warm and inviting. Casual or dressy. Very cool vibe to this place without the pretentiousness found at most Queen St hip spots.
Great music, great vibe. Basically no BULLSHIT 
Really a cool local
Highly recommend the lamb, it's a favourite of mine!
Simple and affordable favourite is the rigatoni and tomato sauce, you can order it off the menu and it's always great.
The shrimp and risotto is lovely too
Often I just have the rapini or asparagus side with a cocktail at the bar.
Yan (Ian) is exceptional, Zack is always awesome and Marty the flamboyant server is Hilarious, and overall they are all generous!
I've been gifted many a shot here.
When getting dessert get the berries and cream with port on top! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Oh gawd am I a fan. Place is casual and loud and you have no idea how good the food is. Service was fab, from the time we were asked to wait a few minutes  for a table (with many apologies) to the time we left. Marissa (I think) was our waitress and she was so good - chatty, fun and full of good suggestions.

Food was to die for - no really. Most of the Italian I've been eating fades into non-memory in comparison. I think if I came from an Italian family, this is what my nonna would make. Meatball - mmmmmmm!!! Pasta with lamb ragu - so good! Grain-fed chicken - yumminess. Ravioli - I'm really going to die by now. Yes, I dug my fork in everyone else's food!!! And still wanted to get dessert (greedy, greedy, but I couldn't let this food fantasy end). Tiramisu - best I've had and their chocolate brownie - so fab I can still taste it in my mouth a week later.

Can't fault this gem - giant nose and all. But I really was in a major food coma by the time I got home."}
{"text":"I feel obliged to update, though it clearly isn't in need of any more praise. 

I had my birthday dinner here last year, the service was spectacular and hilarious - really set the tone for the night so I'm truly grateful to our waiter for making it a crazy night. Of course as always the food stole the show.

If something works, keep doing it right? A few months ago I insisted we hold one of our corporate events there. Beyond shocking many a king west snob with the fact that there really is life east of the Don Valley,  the strongest validation came from one of our admins, the sweetest Portuguese lady who reminds me of everyone's favorite granma growing up, and a serious cook mind you - \"I've never been to a restaurant where the food was so fresh, just like good home cooking\"

Need I say more?"}
{"text":"This place was being suggested by 2 ppl that I randomly asked for advice. I went dinner on Thursday eve on a rainy Day, dressed nicely thinking the rain cant stop my plan, and was looking forward to it very much. To be honest I liked the food, but the service was HORRIBLE. 

I think the waitress was mad at the world or she's missing a nerv not knowing how to smile. She came over n her tone of voice was like she's mad at us, cant wait for us to leave. Just her whole attitude pretty much ruined d dinner experience. My friend read reviews before we came and I heard ppl saying they had bad service, it was really NOT exaggerating. We ordered mushrooms for side dish, the server or some bus boi guy came and just tossed the dish on the table as he flew by. I saw the plate shifting on my table...lmao. Yeah he must be rushing somewhere lol. The mushrooms were delicious though. 

Me n my friend both ordered \"Sexy slow cooked Duck leg\". NOT SURE WHY they have to call it SEXY because its NOT sexy. Its just pice of dark brown looking duck leg on a beding of mash potato. I understand sometimes restaurant make up names to make dishes stand out, but this name seems little \"slutty for the \"class\" they try to advertise amount customers. Only while everything else has normal name n plain definition on the menu, that \"sexy leg\" just seemed very odd n funny. It was very comforting. The meat of duck was roasted perfectly and the mashed potato is really great to go with it. to my surprise it was very filling. 

I would give food for 4 stars, and service for 1 star. I asked my friend who ordered the same thing, which duck leg dish was better between restaurant \"Brasaii\" n \"Gio Rana\". We both agreed the slow cooked duck confit we had during SummerLicious  were better(I would give that dish 5 Star at \"Brasaii\") Over all, the food was good, I liked the place, its very plain but it has something timeless and laid back atmosphere. It's hommy n lovely. I dont like the price though, its definitely not for the service u get, and decoration is not exactly upscale. There bunch of small low tables and a few High ones feel like eating at coffee shop. I was at the High one at the very back conner by window n considering to be lucky seeing the rest ppl were \"fighting\" for space and waitress has to adjust her body to make way thru for food and bill. The waitress finally came to table to ask us how was the food, and her smile was so unsincere while her face was twitching, it turns my stomach. It's not one's privilege to think they deserve tip because they work there. 

PS. I bought like 4 lb of pork tenderloin from Metro yesterday and spent 7 hrs making this pulled pork with apple n brown sugar thing. I made mashed potato as side, ironically I served pork on bedding of potato, it looked n tasted similar to the SEXY duck leg I had Gio Ranas so it reminded me of that dish I had a day. I felt bad for my friend who paid for it. It was not worth $90 with the service they provide. will go back to that restaurant if that woman is not working there. She prob just got dumped by her bf that day!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much, I only been here once.. but if I could go everyday.. I would.  The food is Amazing! Easily one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. I haven't went recently, but I swear I need to go before Christmas and just eat, drink wine and chat the night away. It's really dark in this restaurant, but I don't mind. it's very soothing and comfortable, and has a nice atmosphere. I simply love it. It's a must try, watch when you come and thank me later, I will just say I told you so."}
{"text":"Food is great.  Atmosphere is awesome.  The only reason I didn't give a 5 is because often ..you r forces to wait for a table -even with reservations.  This is a great Lealieville spot and a place I've taken family, friends and even a date.  Great vibe, great specials and just one of my favorite spots in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing! This place is just fantastic. We went here for a friends birthday, we were looking forward to it based on the reviews. Ambiance is pretty cool, a little on the hip side with popular music playing in the kind go loudly in the background.  Good choice of wines, decently cheap bottles too. Tasty and fresh bread with balsamic and oil when your seated was great. We ordered the Giant baseball sized meatball which was so juicy and delicious with decent amount of marinara and fresh parm slices on top! for pasta we got the gnocchi which was alright, nothing amazing. As for the main course.... words cannot describe how tasty and satisfying the ribeye wrapped around pulled pork was. It was the best thing I have ever eaten. My partner ordered the beef rib which was also tasty and soft, however we both preferred my pulled pork wrapped in ribeye delights!"}
{"text":"I was first introduced to \"The Nose\" a few years ago. I was a bit taken back because there was no signage and it seems a bit run down from the street. But once you walk in you realize it's a very unique and eclectic restaurant. I've been to \"The Nose\" a handful of times and have always been completely satisfied with the service and food. It is a bit far from where I live so I always plan to go when there's a special occasion or something to celebrate. You really really really are a nice restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow. Went last night on a whim and a recommendation from friends in the area. We arrived at peak and our service was a tad slow - however once the food was ordered we didn't have to wait long for the risotto balls and mozzarella salad to arrive. Inhaled the food, it was so flavourful and satisfying. The mains were unreal. I had a small bowl of the melt in your mouth gnocchi and the rest of the table had the crispy chicken and stuffed salmon. We were all beyond satisfied and would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants high quality food in an unpretentious atmosphere. The staff are all very friendly and the cost was well below what we assumed it would be for the quality of food. We will be back with all our friends."}
{"text":"Still my favourite, and consistently wonderful. All of the servers look happy to be working there. Try to get Josh, the dude that looks like a cuter David Arquette, as your server. He's the best of the best. 

Lovely ambiance, terrific food, great specials and funny decor! Oh, and you'll have to take everyone's word for it that the place is really called Gio Rana's Really Really Nice Restaurant as there's no signage and no website to verify this fact.

NOTES: Closes early (10pm I think?) and they don't take debit. Whatever you do, for the love of all things holy, don't come without cash on hand. The nearest ATM is across the street, and if you know anything about what's across the street, it's what's currently giving Leslieville a bad rep. You can chance it, but if you get shot, don't say I didn't warn you!"}
{"text":"Came here with some girlfriends and had a great time! Excellent service! 
We ordered some appetizers to start: grilled calamari was tender and had the right amount of garlic. The meatball was amazing! Almost creamy the meat was so smooth and light with a great hint of cheese. The gnocchi was just okay- but the carpaccio was outstanding! The Parmesan and arugula complimented the rich raw beef beautifully. 
The main  was slightly disappointing as the shrimp was a bit fishy, but either way great experience and I can wait to come back."}
{"text":"What the heck was I talking about in my last review of this place? Apparently I was a 70 year old woman in 2011 who couldn't handle noise? Weird. Moving on... 

This place is as solid as the bank vault you can reserve at the back of the restaurant. It's as strong as the nose that sits atop it. It's lovely, and is no longer the coolest kid in the neighbourhood, so on a Thursday at 8pm I didn't have to wait for a table. 

I had their salad of the day (fennel can do no wrong), their linguini carbonara (creamy and yoke-y) and their piece de resistence: the osso bucco. Fall of the bone jus-soaked perfection. The gentleman across from me had pulled pork wrapped in ribeye with gorgonzola sauce and gravy. I'm not a pulled pork person, but it looked pretty epic. 

PEPPER'S PISSED about their wine mark up. It's a bit much, Nose."}
{"text":"Great variety of Italian tapas and wine.... 

Service was good. Nice crowd.

AWESOME AMBIANCE where memories can be made!!!"}
{"text":"Our friends in Toronto raved about this place, and they live in the neighbourhood.  This summer we were there for a visit, and loved wandering around Leslieville.  

While walking we noticed a large paper mache nose outside this otherwise unmarked building.  This was it!

Inside was PACKED!   We got a little table for 4 and despite it being really busy, it was kind of cozy and nice, it wasn't overly loud and felt really comfortable.

The service was really great despite being so busy - its nice to see restaurants that can actually handle a crowd while maintaining good service. 

The food here is sort of like Italian tapas.  We ordered the meatball, involtini, grilled calamari, and a few other plates.   The involtini and meatball were amazing.  

This restaurant is a not to miss if you are heading to Toronto, or specifically in the Leslieville area.    I'm still craving the involtini months later."}
{"text":"From the outside Gio Rana's is really non descript with no title or signage except for an obscenely large paper mache looking nose poking out....I guess it's easier to spot when driving along queen street.

They don't take reservations however we came in on a Friday right at 6pm and were quickly seated however within an hour the place was predominately packed. Gio Rana's used to be a bank and the decor is basically the remnants of what used to be. Think original stripped and fading dry wall adorned with frameless strange paintings, high ceilings with air ducts, mismatched tables and chairs, chandeliers, and candlelight. Romantic and kitchy all at the same time.   

After being seated at cozy table near the back of the dining room we were promptly brought a round waters and a delicious and plentiful assortment of warm bread with a dish of prepoured balsamic and olive oil.

Our friendly waiter went over the specials for the day and gave us some recommendations. The menu is split into four sections, antipasti, primi, secondi, and contorni. Everything on the menu appealed to me so I ordered a little something from every section!

Antipasti

Grande meatball in ragu sauce
This is a MUST order! Hands down BEST meatball ever!! Not only is it huge & juicy but it's soo tender and light packed with flavour sitting in a delicious ragu sauce perfect for dunking each morsel in. I drool just reminiscing over this beauty!

Pan Seared dry packed scallops w/ Italian pork belly and jus 
Perfectly cooked sweet scallops paired with decadent smokey and salty pork belly, a heavenly combination

Primi

House made Potato gnocchi w/ bolognese sauce
Large and plump almost dumpling like texture but still very airy in that thick rich flavourful bolognese

Secondi

Involtini - Pulled pork wrapped in Ribeye w/goat cheese and jus
My two favourite meats combined in one dish! This was a no brainer for me to choose. The pork was totally melt in your mouth tender with bits of caramelized onions and the chargrilled taste of the beef with salty creamy goat, it was just an amazing dish all around!

Contorni

Roast yukon gold potatoes w/ onion and garlic
Sweet potato mash w/ brown butter
Both potato dish were flawless and flavourful

Brussel Sprout slaw with asiago cheese and crispy pancetta
I loveee my brussel sprouts but never have I had them as a slaw! Truly outstanding combination from the crispy pancetta, salty cheese, raw crunchy sprouts and tangy vinaigrette dressing I adored every bite!

Finally onto dessert....I was literally bursting at the seams by this point with utterly no room for dessert... but who am I kidding as soon as I saw the dessert menu I managed to conjure some up!

All the desserts are homemade and sounded delectable!

Homemade brownie w/ chocolate caramel sauce
Warm right of the oven, fudgey centre drizzled with a divine chocolate caramel accented sauce with fresh berries and a dollop of cold whipped cream....geez what's not to love here?

Tiramisu
Done to perfection! Just the right amount of cream perfect balance of coffee flavour and with the rum flavouring in background not soggy at all and just the right sweetness sitting on a pool of warm chocolate sauce. All I can is Yummmmmmm

I love everything about  Gio Rana's! The service is spot on, everything came out in perfect timing, dishes cleared promptly and water refilled on cue, our waitress was really attentive checking on us after every dish was delivered, the food here is just amazingly delicious, from the combination of flavours, textures, and aromas everything just surpassed my expectations! If you haven't been here already I suggest you make it a priority pronto and you can thank me later!"}
