{"text":"A really nice place to eat. The atmosphere is quiet most of the time. The food is great and the service is friendly and helpful. It also offers takeout so you can call ahead and pick up whatever you need to. The prices are reasonable and they have a good selection of food."}
{"text":"This place is a regular as the pho dac biet is off the charts! The subs are amazing and the service is always great! I'm drooling just thinking about the food and can't wait to come back!! Keep up the great food/service"}
{"text":"Been a regular here since I was a kid. The food has always been consistently top notch, even with the change in management a few years ago. I am extremely picky about Viet food (nothing is as good as Mom's) and this place is more than satisfactory, every time.

My sprouts are always fresh, the broth is clear and naturally flavourful, and portions are reasonably generous. 

Service is always pleasant, whether you are Vietnamese or not. Unless something drastic happens, I'll never stop coming here."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite Vietnamese restaurant! Staff are super friendly and welcoming. Pho and bubble tea are amazing, I recommend this location to all my friends and family!"}
{"text":"Wow. Once again, fellow helpers steered me right. Came to this place for my first time today and tried their house special Pho Soup. Excellent portion, broth and meat to noodle ratio. I went for the Xlarge size and struggled to finish. But I did, not because I was still hungry, because it was as just thaaaaat good!!
Friendly stall here also, makes the whole food experience a treat!!"}
{"text":"Very good portions. The banh mi was very delicious. I got the grilled pork. One of my dad's favorite spots. Now I know why. Vermicelli noodles were tasty and my dad's rice was huge. Decent pricing. Will come again. Just too bad I live in seattle."}
{"text":"This is currently my go to pho spot & has been for the past 5 years, maybe more. Very friendly service. I usually order rare beef and beefball & the quality is consistent. Portion sizes are fair, not overly generous but the right amount for what you pay for. I would recommend this place to any pho lover."}
{"text":"Great choice! We just looked up Yelp and found this little place, the ladies that served are all very friendly and everyone that comes in are regulars!
The soup is very homey and filled with flavour that is not overwhelming with spice!
I loved my Seafood and Pork Noodles, it comes with a mixture of rice and egg noodles!
The Bun Bo Hue is an all beef version and there's lots and lots of beef! 
I'm so glad to find this little place and next time when I'm in town I will pay the ladies a visit again!!"}
{"text":"Come here if you're HANGRY (mad hungry/angry cuz you're hungry). Big portions for a good value. I tried the #1 satay beef pho - broth is flavourful and the beef isn't chewy. We also shared #B2 Combo 3: Vermcelli bowl with BBQ pork, pork patty and a spring roll. Meat and noodles in soup will forever be my jam."}
{"text":"My neighbourhood Vietnamese restaurant. I've tried others but they're never as good nor as friendly as these folks. 
Everything from the soothing Pho, to Bahn mi, bun and bubble teas are very tasty and well made. Prices are right on. 
Heads up that they close early on Sundays, at 4pm but they are open early every day at 10am."}
