{"text":"Excellent bbq.  The best meat were Harami Miso skirt steak and Premium rib eye.  Surprisingly Filet Mignon was not as tender.  The other popular dishes were Spicy Tuna Volcano and Chicken Garlic Noodle were very tasty.  This would be a must go eatery in Vegas."}
{"text":"Love this place ! Would not have discovered this place without my client's recommendation ! So my client, a pure breed Japanese said Gyu-Kaku is a very popular chain of restaurant in Japan!"}
{"text":"Our first Gyu-Kaku experience was amazing.  The service was great, the food was excellent and we will definitely be back again.

We (my husband and I) had the Surf and Turf option for two at $77.77  It included edamame, dumplings, broccoli and cheese fondue, miso soup, salad, ahi poke, salmon, garlic shrimp, bibimbap, marinated skirt steak (our favorite) and american style kobe beef along with veggies for grilling and to top it all off smores!  

Ryan our server was extra attentive!  The food came promptly and Ryan instructed us on exactly how long to cook the various food items as well as what sauce would complement them.  Before we cooked the kobe style beef, Ryan even came to switch out our grill so it would be fresh for that beautiful cut of meat.  

There was so much food, we were stuffed to the gills and still had leftovers to bring home.  

Both managers stopped by our table to ensure or experience was exceptional.  It was a nice touch.  We made a reservation in advance, but it was Monday night and we probably didn't need one.  It was nice not to have to wait for long amounts of time like other BBQ places.  We were definitely impressed and will be back again!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place while I was on vaca in Hawaii. I was so excited to find that there was one in vegas. Originally I was going to give a 4 star review, but the hostess was so bad, she cost them a star. As I walked in she was texting on her cellphone, openly. She rudely insisted that she could seat my party until they were all here, even tho I said they were parking the car and walking in. She showed us the table and literally dropped the menus at the table. When I made the reservation I specified I needed a hair chair so before she left I requested a highchair. She barely glanced back and said they don't have highchairs they have boosters.  My son cannot sit up by himself yet, so he could not use the booster. This is a Japanese BBQ place, so I could not assist with cooking, I had to hold my son throughout my dinner. 

Besides the useless hostess, the food is amazing here. The happy hour will only give you about a dollar off, but considering how many dishes you typically order, it's worth it. Don't be cheap with the meat! The hanger steak is about $7 but totally worth ordering at least 3 servings!


I went back in a few months later per the request of Aki, the VP. The \"manager\" Tracy was so resistant to help us. She only stopped by to review the bill embarrassingly in front of my guests. Tracy felt that a $12 discount compensating for my previous experience. That's ok. I won't have to waste anymore time or money at that place."}
{"text":"Gyu-Kaku is by far, my favourite restaurant in Calgary. I have waited all my life to try Japanese yakiniku-style cuisine, and my high expectations are always met here.

The food is just delicious. We always get a varying degree of chef-made dishes, and raw meats and vegetables to grill ourselves.  My fiancé absolutely adores the Beef and Garlic noodles, from the way they serve it in a hot stone bowl, to the perfect ratio of garlic and spice they use. 

My personal favourite, and I have yet to visit without ordering this, is the Yaki-Shabu beef. It is thinly sliced and cooks quickly over the grill, and the wonderful flavour of the marinade pairs perfectly with a bowl of steamed rice, sprinkled with some of their sweet soy sauce! The place is also very well ventilated, so you need not worry about liking your meat a little TOO well-done.

It's always hard to choose dessert, with your options ranging from deliciously rich chocolate cake, to soft and chewy mochi ice cream. They have traditional Taiyaki, or you can choose to roast smores over your grill!

As for the service, every waitor and waitress you come across is helpful, tentative and kind. We never have any problems flagging down somebody for another order, and they make the rounds to refill drinks often. Our food always arrives quickly, and the wait staff is nothing short of perfectly coordinated.

So is there any reason not to recommend this restaurant to your friends and family? Of course not! If I had to change anything at all, it would be the volume of the music they play overhead, only because sometimes you will find yourself shouting across the table. However, you really start to not notice it, and for all the pros of eating here, it really won't make a difference!

I really cannot wait until I get the chance to eat here again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had the \"Premium Meat Lovers for Two.\" Service was incredible! We were greeted with a Japanese cheer by all the staff upon entering the dining area to be seated. The food was amazing - the meat was tender and deliciously savoury. Our favourite meat was the, Harami Miso Skirt Steak along with the Chicken Karage (appetizer). The restaurant itself was clean and air conditioned. The ventilation was also pretty great, we didn't come out of the restaurant smelling like BBQ. The portion sizes were more than satisfactory, you'll be full and happy. To avoid waiting for a table, make reservations. Enjoy the wonderful food, friendly service and welcoming ambience!"}
{"text":"The only thing this place has going for it is that it presents itself as a Japanese yakiniku restaurant, and not just another Korean BBQ place.  There is a subtle difference, and there are far too many of the latter, not enough of the former in America.  

But that's the only good thing I'll say about it.  Food was terrible.  I mean, I really don't know how you screw up raw meat and dipping sauce, but they managed.  Pork belly was inedible; had a funny taste, like it had been washed in soapy water or something.  Beef was flavorless and tough.  Only three dipping sauces, and not a one tasted decent (okay... the Ponzu was alright.  Nothing special, but not nearly as terrible as their Sweet or Spicy Shoyu).  Rice was mushy.  The night I went, they were also out of mixers for half their cocktails, which is inexcusable from a restaurant that's directly across the street from a grocery store.  

Maybe for locals who've never traveled, the dining experience would be different enough they might enjoy it.  But for someone who's had the real thing, and can make better at home, it's a waste of time and money.  Oh, and my stomach hurt for two hours after eating there; no clue what that was about, since I certainly didn't gorge myself."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant ! Les noodles sont bonnes, les menus proposés sont bien garnis et le cadre est sympa."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is enjoyable with any size group. Wait was too long for this service.
I ordered chicken karage as a starter. To my surprise it came to the table poorly executed. Chicken was not fried properly to even look crisp and not to mention it was cold. Outter layer became mushy, made it seem it has been previously fried and was returned to kitchen to be brought out again for ordering guests. Food runner came to ask if everything was alright, quickly said the dish was cold and not hot. He immediately apologized and took the dish and walked away. Within 5 minutes the manager came by with the dish and called out chicken karage and set it on our table. It was the same... cold and not fried properly, there was not even a slight steam trail that I can see. Server finally approached table and asked if things were alright. I did not intend to be abrubt but two times I have complained and the same result has come to the table. I do not understand if it was cooked and just waiting to be served it was absolutely not freshly prepared. 
Ordered egg soup and it was warm to touch not hot. No steam!!! Same as miso soup nothing was hot nothing was cooked properly!
Meat was OK to taste, I have had better.
I will not be going to this restaurant for quite some time. I feel the servers and whoever runs the place have no experience in the food business of ensuring satisfied guests. No one was attentive enough. If I will be paying $145 for my meal I expect service and QUALITY.  Only takes one chance for a first impression. I was not impressed."}
{"text":"Delicious food I recommended the prime garlic shoyu steak. Was well taken care didn't have to ask for refill and friendly too thank you GYU!"}
{"text":"We ordered the dinner for 4 and everything was delicious! Grilling on the table was a lot of fun. The beef noodles were one of my favorite parts."}
{"text":"Better than Kbbq in my book. Fast service, delicious food, lots of options. Ryan was a STAR server and our party of 13. Great restaurant."}
{"text":"Japanese BBQ. Happy hour special which is good price. From $1.5 and up. Love this pork belly and skirt steak. Hot food item is good too. 

A little bit disappoint on their beef tongue. It is $8.99 per dish with around 8 pieces. Tasteless and very thin slice. Happy hour beer only $2.99. Veggie dish is excellent too. We have mushroom medley and spinach garlic.  

Good service provided, our server Yoshi is very helpful and explain the menu and cooking time for each dishes. 

They also have 2 people set menu starting at $45 for happy hour period which is from 12 pm to 5 pm. Love this restaurant and Will come back again. Recommended! 

Reservation available via Open Table app. You may also want to download their app from IOS or Android and start earning their point and can use to exchange for free dishes or cash certificate."}
{"text":"Spotted this wonderful looking japanese bbq place and decided to give it a try.  I can honestly say that given all the people waiting outside to get a seat, I thought this place was going to be amazing.  Sadly, the only thing I can say was amazing here was our server.  Came here with a party of 2 and ordered the premium meat lover set, as a meat lover this was suppose to be something to be excited about, but the quality of meat here is very similar to what you're getting at all you can eat restaurants.  Meat here are low grade and are quite bland, this gets worse when the meat is already cut up for you and all the juiciness are gone from the meat. I've had better meat quality at an all you can eat japanese bbq place.  In comparison to other japanese bbq restaurant, I don't think I would want to come back."}
{"text":"Great place to come with both small or big group of people.
I didn't make a reservation so I had to wait a bit but so after all, I am satisfied with the food and the service I got from here.
Will definitely come back someday!"}
{"text":"Tried the sukiyaki bibimbap and #1 recommended meat. Both were delicious!

This was my first time trying a Japanese style of BBQ and it was great, better than any other Korean BBQ experience I had. 

The grilling plate was kept clean and they provided a variety of sauces. 

The waitress was also very friendly and took the time to explain the menu to us."}
{"text":"Horrible experience, usually my fiance and I go to this place and in the past we have been treated extremely well...we simply asked for our waiter to change our BBQ dinner for 2 to the more expensive one 5 min after we ordered...the manager was sent to our table and only after arguing with us did he end up doing what we had asked...after that our server wouldn't even serves us and we ended up waiting for our food for over 40 min...not a happy customer"}
{"text":"I had dinner there a few hours ago and I've been running to the bathroom for the last 2 hours. I'm very used to eating undercooked meats and Japanese BBQ, so I don't know why my stomach is not taking it well. Other than that, the meat quality is pretty good, but the beef tongue was a big disappointment. I love beef tongue and I always order it when I have Japanese BBQ, but the quality just wasn't good. I didn't enjoy the Harami miso steak that was 1/2 off either. The butterfish was really good and so was the Kalbi beef. My favorite part of the dinner was the dessert, Lady M. Green tea Crepe cake. The service was good and the staff were all very friendly and helpful, but the meats were just OK to me and having such a terrible stomach ache doesn't help either. I highly suggest cooking all the meat thoroughly as advised on the menu!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is on point - servers have high energy but layout doesn't allow for privacy. Food and price not that great. Aquired taste."}
{"text":"My favorite food spot in town. For several years I would visit the Kakus around L.A. whenever I was there, so was very excited to see one open here in Vegas. I usually end up here at least once a week for lunch or dinner. Also, one of the few places open until midnight which I take advantage of often as well.

I've gotten to know everyone there. Brian is often my waiter and a lot of fun as he always seems to be in a great mood. The managers Chris, Shay and Tim all take good care of me.

Food is great and reasonably priced. I recommend the Hirami Skirt Steak, Egg Soup and Spicy Chicken."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Gyu-Kaku BBQ!  The one just opened in Vegas is definitely the best I've been to. Gone there twice in the past 2 months (no! I'm not a professional gambler) but it's definitely an off-strip destination for me whenever i come to Vegas.  The quality of the meat here seems to be better than the one I've been to in the Bay area.  Ambiance is upbeat and always lively.  Ah, you must check out the bar and ask \"Bella\", the bartender for a Sake bomb!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favor restaurant . I have dined here for several times already. It has nice music , good service and the food is fantastic .they have various meal to chose from. The price for happy hour is good. 

My friend and I went for lunch this time . We had their lunch special, Japanese hamburger steak set and Tomato Parmesan garlic noodle set. Total with drinks we spent $30.  It's very reasonable.  

I'll defiantly come back again !"}
{"text":"I went to Gyu-Kaku in new york a couple of times. I am so excited to see they finally open in Toronto! They are still in the  soft opening phase, so no lunch no drinking menu yet, but you do get 20% off! The food quality is as good, but the pork belly is a little bit too thick and too fat, I would avoid that dish. Garlic noodle is to die for :)"}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of this restaurant, until yesterday. My friends  and I were on vacation in Las Vegas over the weekend and we couldn't wait to eat at Gyu-Kaku. We arrived and were immediately seated. Our server was nice, but very very slow. It took over 20 mins to get drinks. It took about 45mins to get one of 15 plates. The last dish was brought to our table about 5 mins before we left. The rice and noodle bowls were dry. When I brought this to the Managers attention he agreed that the food on our table looked bad. He said he was going to give us a credit. The bill came and the credit was about $6... not even enough to cover the price of a rice/noodle bowl. When I expressed my concern about the credit to the Manager, he increased the credit by a couple of dollars and smirked. I'll never eat here again."}
{"text":"Tired of KBBQ and want a new experience? Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ will sweep you off your feet!

The newly hottest Japanese restaurant is located on 6 Ave SW (the corner of 6 Ave Sw and 6 St SW) and is minutes away from The Core. If you haven't heard about or been to Gyu-Kaku then I strongly recommend in doing so. 

My experience was beyond phenomenal and being the first time there they treat you like you're a loyal customer. When you enter through their doors you'll be greeted by one of their hostess now depending on what day and time you go, you'll either be seated right away or would have to wait a bit but in my case I got lucky since there was no waiting and we got seated right away. 

The server asked us if we been to Gyu-Kaku before and we said no, she explained to us about the menu choices and how it works. Roughly it's like any KBBQ place that you've been to minus the AYCE. There are set courses per group of people dining and an order section. Prices reflect on what you get per order and sadly since it is not all you can eat so once you're done, you're done unless you decide to pay and order more food in.

I've never been so intrigue on how they carefully marinated their meat selection and a big bonus because they tell you how long you should cook each individual food item for. Yes you can wing it and cook however the way you like it but for best health practices it is strongly recommended to follow what your server has said.

The experience and the quality of the food is amazing and I would strongly recommend Gyu-Kaku."}
{"text":"We got the Premium Meat Lover's for 2:

Excellent service, fresh and delicious tasting meat, a good variety of veggies. 
I would definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Went there with a few friends during happy hour and it was excellent from moment one!! The service as wonderful, so attentive at all the right times and left us to talk and eat for the rest of of the evening!  Because we got there at happy hour, the combinations were discounted 20% and most of the drinks are half off so we were paying around $6 a drink. The food was very delicious and fresh! The meats were high quality meats and very tender. I want to go back already!"}
{"text":"Oh man, where do i begin! Came here to celebrate my graduation with my family after a friend had suggested it. Ive never liked the whole concept of cooking your own food, but im currently on a trying new things kinda spree. We were seated at this big booth and greeted by our waiter, she was awesome! Then we got our menu, it was a bit overwhelming with all the choices but we decided to do course menu despite it was happy hour. We decided to do meat lovers course and the 4 of a kind course, there was so much food! The meat came marinated and seasoned amazingly and it was really fun cooking while eating. Im a fan. Also try the Coral Reef drink! Heaven in your mouth! Im a fan of lychee and if you are too youll love this. We ended the dinner with smores. It was a good night and a great place."}
{"text":"Calgary's first legit Japanese BBQ house. A bit pricey and portions are smaller but taste somewhat similar to how it is in Tokyo. Exceptional service to add"}
{"text":"Love barbecue, love this place. At my favorite places I eat so much I can barely walk back to the car, let alone remember to check in or write a review. Good service, good prices, and pretty good selection. 

My favorites are toro beef (beef bacon) and yaki-shabu (beef chuck). They are thin slices and take less than a minute on each side to cook. Part of the reason they are my fav is cuz they cook the fastest! Haha. Filet mignon and harami miso steak are also very good, of course. 

Try the buttered or cheese corn, bacon chips, garlic rice, and miso soup in between the grill changes ;) 

Good luck and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Really great tasting sushi and the atmosphere is great. The staff were very friendly and it was a great place to take a family! My son really enjoyed it there and was so happy when at the end of the night he was able to pick a pokey box to have :)"}
{"text":"it is my first time come here for eating. It is a good place for party. I prefer New York streak if you like. The spicy sauce tasty good. The store is close at 11:30 during the weekend. If you have an opportunity, you can go with your friends to have a great time."}
{"text":"I had an amazing time here with my girlfriend and brother. We came and the atmosphere is absolutely relaxing and when we sat we couldn't be happier. It is the first time we had been here and in any kind of this restaurant. As we looked through the menu the specials for two people caught our eye and we ordered one and split it 3 ways. As we finished we weren't full and decided to order more. Our server JJ was awesome in recommending different things off the menu. When we finished the recommended things we moved onto dessert and the smores were a cool thing for the group to enjoy. Will definately be coming back with more people."}
{"text":"Dropped by this place for dinner during their soft opening and overall, I'd say it's a solid asian bbq place and worth checking out.  

We were a group of four, so we decided to order the \"samurai\" course which included different meats, apps, rice, soup, veggies and dessert. It seemed to have the most variety out of all the set courses on the menu.  We also added a couple of items from the a la carte section of the menu.  We ordered a couple pitchers of sapporo since it was only $12 :) awesome.  The mugs come out frosted so it makes the beer extra cold - nice touch. 

The sukiyaki bibimbap was good as was all the different types of beef (kalbi, filet mignon, skirt steak, etc.)  The flavours were pretty much the same as what you would get if you ordered marinated beef from a korean bbq joint.  Nothing was too salty or too sweet - their marinades were on point.  I loved the flavour of the harami miso skirt steak, but this is obviously a chewier cut of meat so keep that in mind.  Usually I find pork belly way too fatty to order at asian bbq places but the pork belly here was actually decent.  We ordered the horumon (intestine) and premium beef tongue a la carte.  I liked the tongue. 

I have to say the service here was definitely the highlight.  Our server was the shit. She was super friendly, explained everything thoroughly, told us how long we were supposed to cook each item, was really attentive, and checked on us throughout the night.  We never had to wait long for our grill to be changed and whenever we needed something, we were able to ask her or the manager(?) with ease. 

I think this place will do well in Toronto :)"}
{"text":"They're not very helpful. We forgot our take out food on the table a full styrofoam of a ramen. Then  i called them after 15 minutes around 11:30 to tell them that I'm coming back to pick it up the guy who answered the phone said they're practically closed. But it says online that they're closing time is 12:30..."}
{"text":"I went during their happy hour, and got the Gyu-Kaku meal. I really enjoyed it, and the service was wonderful. Our waitress was really helpful and answered any questions we had. I did not enjoy the included salad, but it was absolutely not a big deal. 

Had a great time, and the food was great!"}
{"text":"At the beginning the service was slow, given that it was a holiday weekend. The food was delicious for the AYCE. The manager Brandon provided us with phenomenal service, a great manager."}
{"text":"Love this place and the service!
Food is amazing =D Presentation, savory marinating of the meats, the sauces (I like the spicy one) complimenting the bbq'd meats. I'm getting hungry already writing this!
My boyfriend and I are here probably once every two weeks!"}
{"text":"If you can, I definitely recommend taking advantage of the Happy Hour discount for both the cheaper dishes and drink specials. Service is friendly and efficient. It may not be the best tabletop bbq restaurant in Toronto, but is still a decent place for group meals. Overall a nice, casual place to have lunch in the area."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Guy-Kaku over the weekend and were impressed
by the setting and decor of the whole place. Love the old warrior replicas. It was our
first time to visit. We noticed the hostess and waiters were very friendly.  Our server Keiko was great!  The Kobe beef and filet mignon were excellent. I love the way they saute'  the edamame in garlic sauce.  I will definitely come back and will recommend this place to my friends and family :-)"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. My wife and I went there for her birthday. She had $100.00 gift card. At check out, they said their system was down and we had to pay cash. Ruse used to get people to spend twice the $. Bad business."}
{"text":"Great place to eat with friends and family. Affordable price, friendly staff and VERY incredibly food. Recommend for everybody."}
{"text":"I give it 3 starts bc it didn't meet my expectations. It wasn't anything special. The inside of the restaurant was very nice and the staff was friendly. The food was not bad but not the best."}
{"text":"I am a Gyu Kaku chain fanatic.  My fam and I always have Gyu kaku whenever we're in So. Cali.  I was so excited to hear about the restaurant finally coming to Vegas.

Our first experience here was great.  Food tasted well.  It was still the beginning of their grand opening, so I understand the minor kinks that needs to be fixed.  

I'm waiting for lunch hours and Macaron ice cream to come to the Vegas location!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time and we absolutely loved it! We had the meat lovers. It's for 2 people but we had more than enough. I love grilling our meats right on the table. Happy Hour starts at 9 offering really good cocktails. Overall was a great experience."}
{"text":"I went here the other night to check it out. I really enjoyed my visit here. The quality of the meat is really good. Their prices are so expensive.  But you get what you pay for, I guess. I went with 2 other people. We ordered the $66 course meal for 2 people, and we ordered an additional kalbi and kobe beef. The appetizers were just okay. It came miso soup, gyoza, salad, tofu nuggets, and something with spicy tuna on top. It also came with mushrooms and spinach. It came with about 4 or 5 meats. Now, the meats came marinated with their own flavor. The servers are amazing. They are very great! They explain how long to cook the various items. The menu was explained to us, and the server offered his own suggestions. 

I don't think the course was a very good value as it comes with tiny appetizers.  Also, I normally would not have ordered appetizers. If I ever do go again, I'll try their hh items or I'll just get A La Carte items. They should make courses for more than just 2 people!"}
{"text":"Totally different thing than a Korean BBQ place. Not all you can eat and the quality of the meat is way much better! Nice sleek ambient and warm services. Come and try if you are looking for a premium meat quality!"}
{"text":"A must try! Gyu-Kaku is absolutely the best Japanese BBQ place in town! The quality of meat is out of this world, well prepared and amazingly delicious after grilling.

The service is next to none! Extremely welcoming, friendly, knowledgeable and there before you need them. Hands down 10/10 I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Awesome food, awesome service, awesome drinks, awesome prices. I love the vibe this place gives. Coral reefs is my drink here. I been to this location a lot and never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Had the Gyu-kaku for 2, everything was excellent  Definitely plan on going back again in the near future. Don't usually write reviews online but the server Andrew deserves a shout out and the food was amazing. Also my roommate works for a casino, that got us a discount which was much appreciated."}
{"text":"It's our first time being here and the service was okay   not impressed with the servers and it took about 15 minutes to get our drinks refilled.. I don't think that we'll be coming back here"}
{"text":"Great customer service! I love the food except the mochi ice cream. After we ate it with my friend, our tummy hurts so bad. I think it's the mochi. But overall, it's pretty much awesome! Will come back!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I will come back next time. The server is good. The price is not expense. Reasonable price for great food."}
{"text":"During the recent  New Year Eve of 2014, my family came to this restaurant.  Everything was very impressive from the waiting area to the serve table.The food, drink, ambience, customer service were awesome.  My kids enjoyed the Garlic Noodle, The shrimp in cheese fondu. I enjoyed the Sake Bomb drink, Hikari White Oak whisky and of course the Kobe beef on grill.  Fantastic place"}
{"text":"We love coming to eat here! Everything is so delish.  Chili dumplings, sukiyaki bibimbap, spicy tuna volcano, fried chicken karaage, fried bacon chips."}
{"text":"The general manager and the bartender should stop harassing the client on the bar and do there job."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating in a Gyu-Kaku joint and it made an impression right away.
Special thanks to the owners who were very friendly and accommodating. They even decorated the place with authentic materials and designs from Japan. Really cool!...Our food server Yoshi was awesome giving us the detail on how long to cook the meats. High quality meats! We tried the different meats, broccoli and mushroom. To end the our experience was the Sake Bomb! I think everybody should try it for fun. What I noticed too is that you have less of that barbeque smell when you get back to the car. I recommend this to anyone looking for quality food that's reasonably priced with the perfect ambiance. Kudos to the owners and the staff!"}
{"text":"Had a great time here with my family ! Great service, fast & friendly ! Great place to eat with the family to bond ! & oh yeah can't forget the amazing food !"}
{"text":"Took the beloved here for his birthday based on a recommendation from a friend. I'll start by saying that I'm a strict vegetarian and wasn't expecting a lot of choices, but, it was his night so I would settle just for a salad if he enjoyed his experience.. omg!! 

Place was busy but we didn't have to wait for a seat. Server promptly greeted us and was excellent throughout our entire visit. He got the all-you-can-eat $30 buffet, which has SEVERAL meats: beef, chicken, pork, seafood, etc., amongst MANY other options. Of course, none of that appeals to me, so I ordered off the EXTREMELY reasonably price happy hour appetizer menu. I was shocked they had such a selection for vegetarians! I ordered infused edemame, tofu nuggets, and cheese wontons. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! And filling! He loved the flavor of his carnivorous selections and appetizers also. Loved the music. Impeccable service by Jamie (according to my receipt that was her name).. you absolutely HAVE to try this place out! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Mmm it was ok I like Gen a lil more.  t
Their appetizers are pretty good. The drinks tasted as if the bartender was a rookie. The meats are marinated really well. I wish I couldve remembered the name of my favorite 1 but I cant... Sorry. Their green tea creap was my fave!"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials! If you are looking for something out of the ordinary for lunch downtown, this is the place! Their menu is extensive, everything we tasted was good. Ordering a ramen set (comes with Gyoza + salad) and 3 meat choices lunch set (comes with miso soup + salad) was perfect for 2 people. They even have beer specials over lunch time!"}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love this place. Delicious, marinated meats and great side dishes. Friendly, competent staff. Yoshi is the best. Thank you Gyu-Kaku!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't notice this place earlier considering how bright the front entrance is, but it's one of my favorite places to eat now. Place is clean, very modern looking. Food is delicious! Meats are more flavorful than a lot of other asian bbq places. Their cocktails are especially yummy, love the coral reef! Service is excellent and everytime I've been here the manager stopped by all the tables to ask everyone if everything was ok."}
{"text":"First time here and I absolutely love this place!!! The atmosphere is super cool, the food is amazing and the staff are very very friendly. Our server Jamie was very attentive and walked us through the entire menu and even showed us how to cook the food on the grill. We came for Happy Hour which was really affordable. And the dessert is amazing!! We'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! We had a meal for 3 people, the food was great, and the prices were very cheap for happy hour (4 to 6:30). We ate for about 25 bucks each. Beers are 2 bucks each and there are a large number of things on the happy hour menu. I would recommend this pave to get off the strip and have a relaxing dinner for a group at a budget price with excellent food. The shabu beef is the best, if you come you have to get that!"}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ in Montreal. Love that there are a lot of beef choices. Service was good. Great location. Thanks to our waiter Matthew, he was funny and helpful!"}
{"text":"Undercook rice and no yaki shabu ruined my favorite Japanese bbq place. Visited this place since day 1. Lots of changes to the menu. Now  they have ayce menu. The server was very great. Also got to see the ultimate server Ryan..hes great....local boy from Hawaii...works Monday and Wednesday..ask for him. So tonight was a low rating...to come back or not.....?"}
{"text":"It was my birthday and my twin sisters bought me an open table gift card and I chosee to use it here to this restaurant. I wouldn't have come here otherwise. Although I enjoyed the food and the service was good, ironically, the machine was down and my gift card wasn't honored. Needless to say, my husband and I were disappointed. Upon leaving (after picking up the tab), I mentioned it to the hostess...not for any compensation, but just to share. I was given three $10 coupons. So...not a total disappointment but we now have to come back to use the gift...worth it?"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! My favorite meats were Kobe, liver and the skirt steak. Appetizers were yummy as well. Cold tofu with kimchi and crunchy garlic is a must try!"}
{"text":"When I lived in Japan I was close to a Gyu-Kaku and I went there a couple of times every month for AYCE. The service, the quality of the meat and the overall experience were always top-notch. The prices were good too.

So when I found out they were opening a Gyu-Kaku here in Vegas I was pretty stoked. The Korean BBQ places are a good substitute but not the same. I've been a few times since the opening and have always found the food to be good and the service is on point too. I usually make reservations to be safe but I've never had to wait more than a couple of minutes when I just walk in for dinner.

For whiskey fans they have a good selection of Japanese whiskys at the bar and the prices are good too. Bartender told me that their price on Hibiki is the lowest in the valley. I can't verify that but it was low enough for me to throw back a couple of glasses before dinner without thinking twice.

Gyu-Kaku doesn't do AYCE in Vegas (I don't think they do it in CA either) but they have some great meal plans that will bring out enough meat and veggies to where you will be full when you are done. Its more expensive than some of the Korean AYCE BBQ places, but you are paying for quality here."}
{"text":"A few GFs and I met here for lunch, two of which had been here a few times already and wanted me to try it.

As much as I wanted to do the table top BBQ option (pork belly!), I was advised it was quite time consuming. So I went with the Garlic noodle set which came with soup and a salad. 

All our food came out super fast! Everything is bright and inviting (amazing what a few chopped red peppers and green onions will do!) and the noodles came in a (really) hot stone bowl so my food stayed piping hot while I ate. They do not skimp on the garlic for the noodles,  this can be a blessing or a curse, I'll let you decide lol

We were in and out in less than an hour and it only cost me under $15 for a decent meal. You don't get that very often downtown!"}
{"text":"I was there few days ago. We order ultimate all you can eat (which is $40 per person), price is good but when you placed your order, it takes a very long time for the waiter to fulfill your order. The waiter was telling us, since we have two people, he can take 2 orders for each one of us so 4 orders at once. Since my husband was on the phone so I placed 4 orders for both of us once I got the 4 orders then I placed another 2 orders right away. Then the waiter said 'oh, you must be hungry.' I was thinking in my mind 'no, I just want to make sure that I have something to cook for my husband once he finished hi called, since you take a really long time to fill the orders.'"}
{"text":"After visiting this place for the second time, I can finally finish my review that I drafted the first time I was here.

The most important thing about these BBQ places is the quality/freshness of the meat, 5/5 in that department.  Although some items are marinated but I feel though some of the sauces they marinate the meat with could be improved.  In terms of dipping sauce, I find all of them taste very similar, again improvement in dipping sauces can be made.  But this could be subjective, some people prefer to keep the sauces lighter and enjoy the fresher taste meat instead.

One thing I can't complain is how reasonable the prices are, combo for two starts at $55 up to $70.  We chose the $70 combo and I normally eat a lot but this $70 combo is a little too much so good value here.

I think there is always line up at this place so make sure you have your reservation before you bring someone important here. 

There are two parking lots nearby as well as street parking available at the back."}
{"text":"Lot the empty table .... but don't accept walk in customer ... that's some weird service ..."}
{"text":"Came here during their soft opening period.  We loved the food and service.  It was amazing.  We're definitely coming back again with a group of friends to try their group combos so we can try more dishes.  

Food: 
Ordered the Premium Meat Lover's combo for 2.  Consisted of appetizers: salad, miso soup, chicken karage and a sukiyaki bibimbap; bbq items: miso skirt steak, short ribs, filet mignon, toro beef, steak miso, chicken basil, mushrooms, corn and dessert: maple syrup soybean power ice cream.  

All the food was delicious, but there were some items that deserve special mention.  The sukiyaki bibimbap was very good and beyond our expectations.  The sukiyaki flavour was just right and texture of the rice was perfect.  Among the bbq items, I especially liked the miso marinated steaks.  Good quality meats for all the bbq dishes.  I loved the short ribs and filet mignon.  Don't underestimate the bbq sides, the mushrooms and corn was also very good.  The mushrooms came marinated in a special sauce. Had the maple syrup ice cream with soybean powder, very delicious end to a wonderful meal.  

Service: 
Was excellent.  Diana did a wonderful  job explaining the menu and dishes to us.  She would explain carefully how long to bbq each dish and arranged it on the table in a way so that it was easy for us to remember how long to cook each meat type.  She was very attentive and would come to oil and change our grill plate periodically.  We requested an extra change and she was happy to do it for us more.  The dishes came out in a good order with time in between the dishes for us to eat and enjoy it."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and friendly waiters and waitresses. Generous portion. We don't like meat that's overly sweet, which almost all the raw meat has been marinated with sugar, extra sugar. But that's the style"}
{"text":"second time here and this was outstanding.  ryan our man of the night was a perfect example of how a waiter handles orders and explained all servings.  it was a treat to go there with family and friends.  thank you for having a perfect waiter."}
{"text":"I like their cocktails. Very colorful fruity taste.   Food are small portion, but reasonable price. Services are kinda slow, but their staffs are all very friendly."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this place since like last year August. But today, my family and I decided to give it another chance. We got the meat lovers combo. First of all, I noticed that the amount of the gyu-kaku salad was less compared to what I remember. Secondly, I forgot which meat but it was seasoned very salty. Another thing, when we got our s'mores the marshmallows were dry and a little hard. Lastly, service wasn't as good as I remembered. When I told our waitress about the marshmallows she just snatched the marshmallows from me and didn't even say anything. She gave us new ones but they were like the same. In my opinion, this place has gone down a bit with food and service."}
{"text":"The garlic rice & noodles were absolutely to die for. The experience of cooking your own food was different, but interesting. This is definitely a place I would recommend to others looking for a unique dining experience."}
{"text":"I know I've said this before but I really love this place. The lunch specials are amazing and our lunch served (Hi Shane) is always wonderful. My boyfriend gets mad when I come here without him (which I do a lot because I'm mean like that) because we are just that obsessed."}
{"text":"First time to the Vegas Gyu-kaku.  

Exterior is pretty and inviting.  Check!

Hostess had no record of our reservation.  Called around 4pm on the day of for a party of 4.  Still got sat after waiting about 3-5 minutes.  

I see their \"B\" rating is posted.  Yipes.

Waiter took a very long time to take our order.  He had extra tables but kept us informed and was very nice.  

Finally took our order and after waiting a little bit, our drinks and food start to arrive.
Wine glasses were not polished (water spots and lips on both glasses)... :-(

First item - calamari.  Cold but tasty for hungry people.  Appetizers and vegetables start arriving as well.  Edamame - ok, Broccoli with cheese - yum!, Garlic Fried Noodles - ok, Asparagus - ok, Garlic Chicken - yum!, Mushroom Medley - good, Cheese Wontons - ok, but where's the cheese?, Salad - good.

Meats start arriving and we start cooking.  Everything tasty but kind of gristly, at least on the pieces I ate.  We start getting full.  Lots of food for the Meat-Lovers Course.

Many items were forgotten that we needed to ask for...garlic sauce, miso soup, rice, refills on water.

Our last item was the S'mores which were delicious.  My sweet lovin' teeth concurs.  

I know our server didn't mean to suck because he was totally awesome in the end when his station slowed down.  He was gracious all throughout the meal and we will be back.  

Gyu-kaku is definitely fun and a good place for a delicious meal."}
{"text":"This place is excellent even though a bit pricey but worth the money. Me and my friends order the $75 summer special that is for 3 people. First of all their customer service was far the best I ever got. Never had to ask for refills for water always attentive in changing your grills so that your meat doesnt become burnt.  There was lots of food. It came with salad, butter broccoli, spinach, tiger shrimps, calamari, seasoned pork belly, rice and lots of type of beef. There was so much food we became full. I would definitely come back to try other stuff on the menu. 10 times better than Ms.Piggy which their wait times are ridiculous."}
{"text":"This was my first time having Japanese BBQ, it was pretty good. They bring out the meats for you and you cook it at your table on a little grill. The atmosphere is great, the service was great, and the food was good. Sadly they were out of s'mores which was a big selling point for us in the \"Surf n Turf Jackpot Course\"meal we got. We were informed at the end of our meal that they were out of s'mores, rather than before. But otherwise great."}
{"text":"Dinner with the family at Gyu-kaku for Happy Hour! Happy hour ends at 5pm. Made Renovations for 4:30pm and got there a bit earlier after a long day. When we got there, they seemed very confused. Soon we found out we got a super small table for 5 people. My brother had to sit in the aisle, even tho there were plenty if empty seat elsewhere. That aside we ordered two of the happy hour special. It is dinner for two for $55, originally $81. Comes with two miso soup, salad, dumpling, stone rice (sukiyaki beef), three beef plates, one chicken, one pork, broccoli, and mushroom. On the side we got the beef garlic noodles, tuna volcano, and cheese wonton. 

Dinner was very delicious, i miss bbq but this is as close as it can get!  For the happy hour price this is well worth it! 

I do wish we got a bigger table because it was very tight for 5 ppl and we did not have much room to place the food and consistently got bothered to clear the table. My brother got the short end of the stick and had to sit in the busy walk way. Luckily their food was pretty good for happy hour, the experience was pretty fun as well."}
{"text":"Great set menu prices with sizeable portions.  Will definitely leave the restaurant feeling full.  Even though it's not all you can eat.  Will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Came here for our anniversary dinner. Great atmosphere for a fun dinner. Very fun, high energy. The food was great! Hanger steak was the best of the night with the liver a close second. The spicy tuna wasn't very spicy - only negative thing to say."}
{"text":"So happy there's finally a location in Vegas! I always go to this restaurant in LA! this is a great place! great food and service! Tracy was very helpful serving my friends and I. Come visit!"}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place more than we did. Nice building and decor. Food was pretty good, dessert macroon thing was awesome but the bar service was so slow and inexperienced it made the experience overall a 2-3 star experience. Drinks took forever to come and when they arrived the ice was melted so they were made prompts by the bartender but waiter was bad. He also mistook a capt'n n coke one person ordered for a cab n coke and brought a red wine and a coke wtf. Should also note that one person caught food poisoning from something. Laid up from 6am next morning for two days. We were fine except the hangover headache was bad so careful with the house sake it's probly super cheap stuff cuz I didn't drink that much for that type of headache."}
{"text":"This place is fun, with great prices, and great food.
The happy hour is awesome, with many half priced items

My favorite dishes or items:
Cold spicy tofu-Yummy and a huge portion
Karaage chicken-crispy with good sauce
Yaki Shabu Miso-Very thin, delicious beef
Kalbi short rib-fatty and tasty
Pork belly Shio-Fatty umami goodness

I love cooking on the grill, so much fun with friends or family"}

{"text":"Great food and good quality NOT frozen meats!! Wednesday is happy hour all day and two of us are for $55. There was plenty of food... Appetizers, salad, miso soup and 5 or 5 different types of meat!!! Would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"First time here, made reservations for a 7:45 and got sit it almost right away, Steven was our waiter very attentive and friendly we ordered the meat lovers for 2 which is more than plenty for a family of 4, Also got salmon and  mahi mahi everything was very good and tasty.
The music is a bit loud  but in general we had a great experience and will return.
Ps: the windows and entry need to be cleaned."}
{"text":"This place was awesome, first time ever going and was completely satisfied with the price and the amount of food you got.We had great service and have to say our waiter \"yoshi\" was awesome....it was nice to see someone who was one of the happiest people who apparently loved the job he was doing. Will definitely be going back and highly recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I'm big on customer service, I gave them 5 stars because I am from California, I made no reservation as this is my first time here.  They were completely booked out and they found a 45 min gap in there schedule to squeeze me in.  Thank you!!!  Food was delicious!"}
{"text":"We ordered the supreme meat lovers combo for 2. We also added shrimp, scallops and the spicy tuna.
We thought everything was really well done. The flavors were fine and tasty, service was friendly. We got refills on our drinks on time. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Went here as a suggestion with friends and was not let down. Wednesday is Happy Hour all day, I believe and trust me.. you will be happy! They have a great selection of pre-organized BBQ platters, such as the Meat Lovers and Signature Cuts which were within the $10-12 range and come with appetizers. 

Of course they all have the regular sized BBQ meat platters of single meats, a range of appetizers & you cannot beat their drinks.

Will definitely be coming back and trying other things. Service was also efficient and fast, any used plates weren't left on our table for long because they were very quick at bussing."}
{"text":"They recently opened for Happy Hour lunch (hours not currently reflected by their Yelp page)... I did tell their management that they may want to update it.

Regardless, I've come to really appreciate the consistency of Gyu-Kaku as a franchise. This location is on par with its peers in NYC, and perhaps even a little bit better, as some of the appetizers we got were a larger portion than what we get in Manhattan.

Service was great and friendly, as usual.

Pleasantly surprised we could get the Lady M mille crepe here! It is a dollar more, but hey, shipping from NYC, so whatever.

Happy Hour a la carte will always be my favorite."}
{"text":"I have been many times in Cali...love this place..would give the Las Vegas store 5 stars but the loud music and pounding speakers was a real turn-off for pleasant convo in a communal dining setting..could not understand the server's instructions on meat placement and cooking times..this isn't a nightclub.  Hope they make a few changes.  I'll try once more."}
{"text":"Great service! Great price! Excellent taste!
I will  definitely come again if I come to vegas"}
{"text":"Pros:
Flavorful and tender meat selections
Yummy appetizers, including miso soup, cheeses filled wontons, and chicken kariage 
They have fun desserts, including s'mores 

Cons:
No AYCE, either a la carte or buy a set package
Some of the meats presented were a bit bland"}
{"text":"Loved it, I loved the experience I had with my friends. Great host and servers as well all friendly!"}
{"text":"Nothing was bad, but nothing was all that good either.

I like all different kinds of food. I had never done this style of table-top grilling before, and so decided to try it out. 

I started out with a \"Southern Mai Tai\". 
I should have read the menu a bit closer, because it is actually nothing at all like a Mai Tai. It tasted like cool aid with booze. (The \"Southern\" was Southern Comfort. Not a fan.)

We ordered several plates from beef to veggies. When they arrived, I asked the server for her recommendation on cook times. She casually listed them off, \"30 seconds each side for the scallops, 45 seconds total for the beef...\" Sadly, should could not have been more wrong. Either she was terribly misinformed or the grill was awfully cool. 

The scallops took about five minutes to become opaque. The beef took several minutes - even though the slices were very thin.

Folks here talk about the great prices. I suppose it depends on what you order. Four dollars for four stalks of asparagus? I'd say that's a bit steep. ...and then you have to cook it. 

... and it is all cooked on a smoke-free gas grill - which adds no flavor at all. I love smokey flavors - especially in a 'grill' or 'barbeque' meal. 
Give me a cast-iron skillet and a campfire any day.

Spices were modest to the point of being absent. Conversely, the sauces on the table were overpowering. Not recommended.

The Bibimbop was fine. The salmon was also fine once it cooked - but again, I can do better at home.

Good company and a friendly server made this a good hang. 
I would not come back for the food."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant 3 times in the span of 3 weeks. The BBQ is very good. A bit pricey but worth going once in a while. The quality of the ingredients served is very good and the ambiance is great. The staff is always very cheerful and pleasant. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came here due to a recommendation by a friend. Our experience was amazing. I did not think we would fill up on bits put together but we were all stuffed by the end. We chose one of the meat platters to sample a few different things for the first time. Great drink selection. Excellent way to hang out with friends. Servers were excellent and attentive. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with this restaurant at all. The quality of the meat wasn't very high and the meats all tasted similar. I feel like its very \"Americanized\" and I didn't really get an authentic Japanese BBQ vibe. The server was very friendly and helpful with everything, but I just wasn't feeling the food here."}
{"text":"This place has really good food and a fun atmosphere. My only complaint is that the music is beyond loud so if you come w a group it's hard to hear each other."}
{"text":"One of the best Japanese BBQ place I have ever been. We ordered the Samurai (4 people) food set & cocktails. The cocktails were amazing, the food was better than I expected in quality & taste. The service was slow, and seemed always busy or maybe understaffed? The price is a little high for some, but it can be offset by going to certain time of the day to receive discounted food items (further details on their website).

Overall, great food, great atmosphere, an ok service, and a tad pricey for me (but worth it). I would go back again, during happy hour."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Great meat choices and it didn't take long for each order to come out. Great service! Victoria was amazing and we would totally fly back from Florida just to have her serve us again!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants in town - we come at least once a week and we're never disappointed by the food or the service!
Ryan was our server tonight and he's awesome -- super quick and really friendly!
Lily and Yoshi are frequently our servers and they always remember us - even if we're not seated at their tables, they swing by to say hi!"}
{"text":"This is as close to Japanese style yakiniku restaurant experience as you can get in Toronto at present. It is a chain from Japan so it's actually Japanese in origin. Some people have commented that this is not unique compared to Korean style bbq. In this city we are very used to Korean bbq. But this is essentially how yakiniku restaurants are in Japan (my partner is from there) so if you are expecting something different then it's not authentically local. The meats are fresh and well marinated, and the portions from the set menu is satisfying without being too full, which is perfect. Our server Adam was one of the best servers I've had in a casual restaurant. He would keep our beverages refilled, helped with taking down the flames, staggered some of the larger plates for our table, etc, and all with a warm, genuinely friendly smile. The manager Michelle was also very good. I only wish they would add horumon - offal - which is my favourite when I'm in Japan!"}
{"text":"Vraiment delicieux. Ca fait changement du bbq korean."}
{"text":"This place is just ok. I've eaten a lot of Japanese yakiniku and the biggest thing this place is lacking, is the quality of the ingredients. The meat quality does not justify the price you pay for this place. This alone, I won't be coming back here. And I noticed this from the very first piece of tuna we had (tuna salad) to the very last piece. Angela and I ordered one of the pre-made courses and got the most expensive one. Both of us just weren't impressed. So for the same price I know you can find a better Japanese place that does the same thing."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate a belated valentines days with my wife. it's been a while since we've been to Gyu-kaku as we know the prices are a little high compared to places like GenBBQ. but this is due to the higher quality of meat that they serve. 

Our server was Yoshi and he was a great waiter. always checking to see if we need anything. 

Will be coming back here periodically due to cost"}
{"text":"Last weekend me and my girlfriend ate here. It was one of kind place to grill good quality meats that you dont often get at all you can eat Korean bbq. But our server emilia guided us and recommend some of delicious dishes to us & I would come back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the world!!!! I used to go to their \" Beverly Hills\" twice a week when living in Los Angeles! They opened one in Las Vegas as well! Highly recommend to everyone!!!!"}
{"text":"I recommend their lunch menu. For $15.95, you got 3 BBQ meat dishes with rice, salad and miso soup. Great deal!"}
{"text":"I have been there three times since gyukaku opened. I have to say that I love this place! Service is good, the manager definitely has a great sense of humor. Most important, food is very good! I recommend beef tongue, beef rib and toro beef!"}
{"text":"really amazing food and super cheap! customer service was awesome, can't wait to go back again"}
{"text":"Really good. I cannot believe I've passed this place so many times and never thought to go. We did one of the \"value course\" meals for $65. It was a TON of food for the price. It was all very delicious. Loved the flavors. Lots of garlic! We had filet, short rib, shrimp, spinach, zucchini, and more. I also felt like our table was kind of private, which was nice. Service was excellent. Overall, great value for the quality and taste! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Been here 4 times and in hawaii too was always good.but this time they service and the food went down so fast!!!
In my salad i had a big plastic piece!!!! Plastic can you imagine?!! 
Then we ordered water  never get them only after 3 times !!! 
I ordered also a beer guess what!?!? Never get it!! 
The meat grade was awful !!
You need always to look for your server for 3-4 min!

That's my last time here!!!!
Service for me is everything!!!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ and decent service. Really nice atmosphere and great location for business lunch or after-work get-together with coworkers."}
{"text":"Always a great place to dine with friends and it's always 8-12 of us when we go here. Love the meat lovers package, sooo much to eat. Been here several times.... Saturday 4/7 12 In my party and we ordered the all you can eat package and they will only give us 1 plate of each kind of meat. They brought out 2 kinds of meat at a time. How can we split a small plate of meat for 12??? I spoke to the server and he said there should be 2person to split 1 plate of meat, that right there we are already short of meat because we should be getting 4plates per meat so equally divided per couple. He insisted they cannot bring more meat until he called the manager... not sure if the manager understood the situation but he just simply asked \"so do just want more meat?\" Well, that's not the point. If there's 12 of us there should be 4plates of meat to split per couple but you guys keep serving us 1 plate... eventually they kept bringing us more food. No paying customer should experience this that you have to beg and ask and somewhat argue to get the right amount of food in which we paid in good amount. We spent almost $500 with alcohol every time we go there. Never again. The floor was sticky, the hot sake vary in temperature depends on how long the microwave it... (yes! They nuke your sake) the manager needs to improve his attitude and his management skills or this place will go down the drain."}
{"text":"Like all Gyu kakus the food was great. Server was very nice and we had an all around great time. They even had ice cream French macaroons. Location is far out, but a great fun dinner."}
{"text":"I have been eating at their California locations for 10 plus years and I love it. Vegas is the nicest location by far. I just love this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've seen my friends talk a lot about this place. I've never had Japanese style BBQ before, and being a big fan of grilling your own food at a restaurant, I was excited to try out this spot.

Walking into this restaurant, I really liked how they decorated this place. The dark woods, and mellow atmosphere really gave it a sexy vibe. I was digging it.

Gyu-Kaku might have the best grills I have ever seen. What makes them so great are the little vents that surrounds the grill. This makes the smoke disappear quickly, rather than engulf your clothes in meat smoke, which tends to happen at k-bbqs.

The first thing I ordered were the cheese wontons. Out of everything that I had ordered, this proved to be my least favorite. When I was thinking of a cheese wonton, I expected there to be a full pocket of cheese. That was not to be the case. Instead, there was the tiniest sliver of cheese that could be known to mankind. I should have taken a picture of that.

Then my meats came. I thought they were alright. I thought it was good, but I guess I was expecting more. Even though I came in during happy hour, I ordered like three dishes and spent quite a bit on them. Afterwards, I had to go buy a cheeseburger at a take out joint nearby because I was still pretty hungry.

The service here was not very good. The guy taking our order was very nice and accommodating, but he seemed lost at times. I constantly had to flag him down. And, he did mess up our order at the end of the night, charging us for extra things that we didn't order, but we were quickly able to fix the situation.

I don't know if I'll be back here. My experience was so-so. Maybe I'll come back here later in the future if they improve their service. But I thought the food was aight except for the cheese wontons, which were a ripoff. That's my story, and I'm sticking to it."}
{"text":"Our burner was really slow. They made us switch halfway through. We were the first ones seated for the day. That should have been known that that would be slow. It took forever to cook. It was tasty but they should've seen it a lot sooner in our meal and made the switch sooner."}
{"text":"Their Happy Hour is great. You can't beat the prices. I'm in love with their Lychee Sangria."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited on a busy Friday night, despite being told we would have to wait for 10 minutes we were seated within 5, which was really nice. 

Our server was really friendly and attentive. As it was our first time, he took us through the menu letting us know the top popular choices and what he personally recommended as well. 

In the end, we decided on the premium meat lovers set. Out of all the meats we got, I really liked the filet mignon and boneless kabli short ribs, which melted in your mouth!! The other meats were pretty good as well, only downside was the chicken it wasn't very well seasoned but still alright. The sukiyaki bibimbap was also really delicious, full of flavour and the crispness of the rice in the stone bowl made it even better. As for the dipping sauces, the ponzu was my favourite! I could drink that stuff lol 

Only downside was how expensive it can be, for the two of us the total plus tips (including drinks) came up to at least $50 a head, so definitely come during their happy hour!!

Great service and great food! And unlike other BBQ places, you don't leave smelling like hot meat! Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to go here, but I have to say it was a total let down. 

There were 8 of us and all of our alcoholic drinks came out tasting like they put only one drop of alcohol in it, if any at all.  Our server told us she'll send over the manager to talk to us about it, but nobody came over at all.

The service was horrible. The food was okay and it might have been better if our food actually came out like it was supposed to. We basically ordered 2 of everything but none of the 2 dishes would make it out the same time. To top it off, everybody there was so clueless. 

I'm not planning to come back here and won't recommended to anybody."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Good for a group date on one on one. They have everything from fried bacon to beef tongue..yes, fried bacon. The prices are extremely reasonable.

Hint: get the hanger steak, miso wings, if you want to try something new, get the beef tongue. Thank me later."}
{"text":"This place is so good. I have been here 3 times in the last month! I held a business meeting and Mother's Day meeting here. Food is delicious and comes out fast, they have a lot of variety meats. The waiters are always friendly and efficient. The only dessert is Smores, but who cares Smores are all you need. Prices start at $55 but it's usually for 2 people (it's a lot of food). Will definitely be coming back again, again and again :)"}
{"text":"Food: Like any review for restaurants the food is main character. My wife and I had to choose if we wanted to do ala Carte or pre fixe menu which we chose the $55 pre fixe, we did the math and it would come out cheaper and we get the chance to try different cuts of meat. Not disappointed at all most of the marinades we tried were miso based all of it were good. Filet Minon did not have a marinade still ended up pretty decent. Cheese Gyoza were OK, The salads we really liked. We finished dinner with Smore's which is a pleasant surprise since you are at a BBQ place why not smores right? Overall dinner was very good.

Location - Spring mountain and Decatur Cross Streets Asia Town, I prefer calling this place asia town instead of china town since it  is frequented by multiple Asian Ethnicity The parking is in the back and the entrance is facing the road.

Restroom - Clean 

Restaurant setting - I liked the entrance with the displays of samurai helmet which tells you this Japanese BBQ not Korean BBQ.

Service - Service was good, although the server forgot 2 items on the menu she came back to us and added the other 2. 

Overall - I would definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! I love the friendly greeting as soon as you walk in. The waiting area is nice, just in case you have to wait. ( sometimes they get busy)

  First off head down for Happy hour, Monday & Wednesday is all day! What crazy right, well its so worth it. Tuesday&Thursday-Sunday is 12pm -6:30pm and 9pm-12:30am. During these times hit up the appetizers and sides for the best deal.
   Now on the BBQ meat and seafood section just about the same great selection.  Hirami Miso and the Kalbi short rib are a must but don't be afraid to get the Angus beef rib. This might be the best kept secret on the menu! The mushrooms are a must the garlic mushroom is my favorite...

  If this is your first time, start with one of the Value BBQ course for 2. These will give you a great sample of what they have to offer. Just choose what works best you and your party. The best part is after your meal the dessert is they pull off the grill and bring you S'mores. 

  Each time i come here and get great service and they bring out the food really fast, I mean you cook it yourself?  The side dishes are on point as well so be sure to try it all. I love it here and continue to bring friends and family!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and the service was great. I was greeted with the most friendliest server and the food were all amazing. However, they kept apologizing to us but we didn't understand what was going on....we assumed they were talking about the ventilation not working but my family didn't mind that much. Im just happy the service was great and so was the food."}
{"text":"Yummy!! We went when they were doing happy hour combos all night and got the Happy Hour platter. It was surprisingly very filling and we didn't need to order any extra dishes! The happy hour platter was $55 split between two people, and it's their cheapest combo. The meat was yummy, the sauces were great, and the service was friendly. It's on the more expensive side so I wouldn't be coming here every night, however it's great every once in a while! It does get quite smokey as you're barbecueing so expect to end up smelling like meat afterwards.

Unfortunately the restaurant is going through some issues with tenants upstairs and stop accepting walk-ins by 8PM (we were turned away last time!) however this should only be going on for the next couple of months."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend and it was our first time eating there. The food was good but the only problem was the portions were too little, so we had to order a lot. Good thing I had a $30 off coupon so we only ended up paying $14 + tip. Service was great too. They check up on us from time to time to see if we need something.  So overall, I give it a four-star"}
{"text":"So so good! 

I love everything from the crunchy garlic sauce to some sticky rice creation they have on the menu. The servers are really friendly and on top of everything. I made a reservation for 8PM (Friday) and was seated at 8:02! I will definitely be back! Yummmmmmyyyy!"}
{"text":"Regardless what other yelped about the service.  But if anyone ever visit this place as for Yoshi. Fantastic individual and service was perfect. He take his time explaining the food came back several time to check on the table.  He is an older gentlemen but extremely friendly and happy.  Good service , happy customer !!!!!!!!  Mahalo"}
{"text":"Went for the first time to celebrate a friends birthday, although the price is a bit high (especially for a location so close to a large student community), I would say it's totally worth it.

We ordered the BBQ for 6 and were very pleased. The starting salad was very good and the bibimbap was exceptional (although it was brought at the very end) and made me wish I had more room.

The wide variation of meat that was brought out, while it didn't seem like a ton when we ordered, turned out to be very filling and was more than enough. The filet mignon appeared to be very good quality and the hanger steak was a personal favorite, I recommend you marinade it with the sweet soy and put the meat on your rice.

Service was very good and our server, Agi (sorry if I'm getting that name wrong) was very helpful in explaining everything and was very fast to help us with any requests we had.

Have to take off a star because the first thing we said to us when we sat down was that they would be kicking us out in 2 hours, however we only ordered 30min later and the food took 30min before it started coming out, which is surprising since most of it is raw meat. Leaving us an hour to eat, which for a party of 7 in a Japanese BBQ is not long. Although no one actually came to kick us out after that time period.

Overall very good experience and I completely recommend Gyu-Kaku for either just a night out or a celebration."}
{"text":"Really good service the server was at our table literally every five minutes giving us instruction and helping us along the way. Having been in a lot of table top bbq restaurants I wouldn't say this was the best but the quality of meat definitely shows specially in the beef. Would go here with some friends for group dinners and birthdays."}
{"text":"One of my friends recommended me to try this place.So since I'm a big fan of BBQ's and grilling your own food at a restaurant thing, My friends and I went to try the place.

Food was bomb, a bit pricey but so worth it! Service was great, they're very attentive and nice! I'll definitely be back for the Happy Hour since we didn't get to try it cause we went there a lil early.. haha :D

Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick and unplanned lunch today and have officially found my new favourite BBQ spot (sorry Seoul Chako!)

Gyu-Kaku is a world renown Japanese BBQ restaurant that is so beautifully decorated and has an exciting energy about it. The menu is full of BBQ possibilities for you to choose from as well as non-BBQ plates for you to share or eat on your own.

We opted for the 3 choice lunch menu which, for $17, comes with soup, salad, rice, and three choices of meat from the menu. Between myself and hubby, we decided to try all beef dishes (6 in total) and ordered a side of fried chicken which is apparently a specialty of theirs. Service was quick, and everything was totally delicious! The meats were all marinated differently and were really outstanding (except for the Shabu beef). We were surprised at our tender some of the cuts were and were pleasantly surprised at the overall quality of our food.

We left bellies full, totally satisfied with our meal, and already planning our next visit! Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent yaki-niku in Toronto! 

Order per dish or in combos. I like it this way so I can order what I like and not waste any food. 

I arrived around 9:10pm and still need to wait about 20-30mins. Last order was at 10pm. **Better call to make reservations ahead**

Food quality was higher and better than I expected. Filet mignon, hanger steak was my favorite! I ordered horomon with is also good but not as crispy in comparison to Japan or Hk. 

Shio cabbage (salad) was so good. I never really liked the taste of raw cabbage due to the bitter taste. But mixing with the shio dressing totally killed it. It also lighten the meaty taste overall during dinner. 

I'm really happy Gyu-kaku has opened their branch here in Toronto."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty and juicy meats if you like to grill your own meat and are attentive to it. A timer might be handy to have but I mostly did it by eye. For the quality of meats I think the prices are mostly fair. Out of several different meats I tried (Beef rib, Bistro beef, Beef toro, Pork Belly, Miso Chicken and Filet Mignon) all were good except maybe the Filet Mignon which was a bit chewy, which is too bad since it tends to be one of my favorite cuts of beef. It was also maybe the hardest one to cook properly since it's thicker and shaped like a cube. It requires more time to cook like a few minutes depending on how you like it done. The chicken is also another one that's a bit hard to cook through because of the thickness of pieces, the center may be raw even if the outside looks okay. Might be useful to ask for a knife so you can cut a piece and check inside. Most of the other cuts being thin usually require 45 sec to grill so those are easy to cook well. The staff will tell you the suggested cooking time. Surprisingly the meat rarely sticks to the grill, if anything if it starts sticking it probably means you need to flip it over. However, I'd say cooking pork belly or anything with a lot of fat can be a bit dicey. The fat seems to really attract large flames to shoot out of the grill and cause splatter. I'm pretty sure an eager flame licked my hand at one point for a split second. Your clothes will not smell after eating here. I was actually surprised at this. I don't recall even seeing any smoke coming from the grill but maybe I was too focused on the grilling to notice.

There are a choice of three dipping sauces, ponzu, spicy and sweet. The meat doesn't really get much of the sauce flavor when you dip it. In any case, the meat doesn't need to be dipped in sauce and tastes pretty good on its own. The sauces were more useful for flavoring my bowl of white rice. Don't ask me about vegetables, like why would I order those? But yes you can order those here too. There are also cooked dishes if you decide that you're too cool to cook your own food. There are happy hour prices between 12pm and 5pm. There are a fair number of tables. I'd say for each grill you should only have a max of 4 ppl, any more and it feels overly crowded. This is definitely a fun outing for a group that you would do once a while although I don't expect to see myself coming here very often. Mainly because I don't like paying to cook my own food."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service ever slow as hell!!  No one knew how to bring sweet and low , spoons or napkins !!!! Their server \"Saul\" completely worthless !!! And he got automatic gratuity !!! Fuck that !!! And took an hour to bring the check are you kidding !!! Which by the way none of us paid the automatic gratuity!!!"}
{"text":"As a Japanese transplant, it's funny to see that Gyu-kaku is perceived as a cool yakiniku chain in the US. The bar area looks like... well, a bar, even...

That's for a reason - here in the US beef is obtainable cheaper than in Japan, which makes it possible that Gyu-kaku offers higher quality beef without pricing really high like many other Japanese yakiniku-ya do.

Their execution is solid in fact - meat with decent quality, great service, cool ambience. I must admit that now I'm a fan. ;)"}
{"text":"A new eatery has made its way into Las Vegas! I was soooo thrilled to see it come to town after we had such a great experience recently in one of their other locations in Waikiki, HI. 

I love the concept of sitting around a table grilling your dinner and sharing with friends!  This place can easily be the scene of an intimate dinner for 2 or a large group which we happen to be on this occasion. 

Upon entering you are warmly greeted by the host and on this visit our large group was seated promptly. The place is nicely designed and the atmosphere is fresh and welcoming. 

There are so many choices and the pricing is very reasonable. You can do a la cart or enjoy their course menu.  We tried their special of the day which was Harami Skirt Steak, and we also ordered their Bistro Hanger Steak, Shishito peppers, bacon wrapped asparagus and their Shrimp Sukiyaki Bibimbap.   All were delicious but my favorite of the night was the Harami Steak which was so tender and made for the best grilled meat in my opinion. 

Our server was very attentive and informative.  She changed our grill a couple of times and she made her presence known to us throughout our time here ensuring all was good. She really added to the dining experience and had no problem splitting up our checks.   

They apparently hold a high standard here in both food and service as it shows, and just to make sure all is in order and they are in compliance they ask you to fill out a survey after your meal.   

I look forward to dining here again and enjoying another wonderful experience alike."}
{"text":"(11/7/15 Edited)

Service was well, but our waitress had many responsibility to other tables and took a while to oil or grill. We had to ask waiter to do it for us because she took too long. It's understandable, yet when she brought us our meats she did say she was coming back. 

This time I decided to get the meal plan because I would save a few bucks $$$, and get to try different appetizers and meats I haven't before. It's great and satisfies my belly! I SUGGEST getting a meal plan then adding more sides or meat, it's a better deal.

I've been here many time but finally found the time to review this place. Gyu-Kaku's meat selection is great and the prices aren't too bad. I like Japanese BBQ because the grills and vents are different from Korean BBQ. When you leave gyu-kaku you won't leave smelling like oily meats. Happy hour deals are awesome!

SERVICE
Their service was wonderful, they are knowledgable on the items on the menu. They check if you're doing well with the food and change your grill when needed. The servers also tell you how much time is needed to cook your meat and vegetables. 

FOOD
Good quality meat but portions not great. My favorite is beef tongue and it comes with small portions unfortunately. They offer spicy, sweet soy, and ponzu sauce. The ponzu sauce goes well with most of the meats (for my preference). Ponzu is citrusy and it's refreshing. The sweet soy seems familiar to Maggie's soy sauce but sweeter. The spicy is a mix of garlic and spices.

CONCLUSION
Will be back to try lunch deals!"}
{"text":"Really need better qaulity of food. Some meats are frozen and not very fresh.Not good as other Gyu locations. The ice tea I ordered was very waterish. If you want to have the true Gyu experience don't go this one."}
{"text":"A friend of mine introduced me to Japanese BBQ and proceeded to tell me the history behind it all. I was skeptical at first because of my familiarity to Korean BBQ, but I was pleasantly surprised with the whole experience. The quality of meats was absolutely top notch and the value for the meals and portions were exceptional. The lunch menu was delicious and affordable around $10-12. Anyways, I will definitely be returning with friends and family."}
{"text":"Got the Sakura deal. $55. Came with salad, calamari (didn't finish this, too oily and too much batter, couldn't really taste the Calamari), angus beef bites were delicious (tasted like a beef stew, very tender, with mushrooms), garlic were shrimp were way too salty, all the other beefs were good, my husband liked it but I like the Korean BBQ flavors more. The mushrooms medley were good but once again a bit too salty for my taste. There are 3 sauces to dip in so I think thy should have went lighter on the marinate. The dessert was suppose to be a green tea cake with ice cream but instead it came with whip cream which is in no way shape or form a good substitute for ice cream, I was very disappointed with that! The green tree cake was not good either, weird textures to me. Service was great. Got my drink refilled multiple times. Next time instead of the deal I might just prefer individual items."}
{"text":"Went here this past week and the service was probably better than at any Gyu Kaku I've been to (including Beverly Hills, Sherman Oaks, West LA & Northridge) our server was Steven. He was very pleasant and was attentive. 

I took off 1 star for the restaurant in general not this one specifically. It seems like every time I go the portions get smaller and the food just seems to be made with a declining quality while getting more expensive. 

The spicy sauce is probably my favorite sauce from anywhere ever which is why I always find myself back here."}
{"text":"I will definetly come back to this place within the next month. Everything about it is awesome. From when you walk in. To the great tasty food that you cook yourself in front of you. They have a bar incase you have to wait for a table. The meat quality is great. The prices are very reasonable. Especially since they have happy hour options on the food. I definetly would tell people to go here. Save room for desert. Trust me."}
{"text":"The best BBQ restaurant in Montreal!! I will definitely go back to eat~yummy ^^"}
{"text":"A little less than 24hours and I'm still alive, aka not feeling sick.. Lol 

3 stars for the food & presentation being good, but also me being nice .. Gyu-Kaku you did me so wrong last night! :(

First experience about a couple weeks ago was superb, waitress was attentive, informative about the menu and we really enjoyed the food!

Now let me elaborate on last night's visit..
Upon being seated, we saw a baby cockroach chillin' on our table, alive and moving. Beau killed it-- asked me if I wanted to go but trust me I DONT KNOW why we stayed.. Service was good, but I just couldn't help myself in checking and making sure every item did not have a cockroach in it.. Don't get me wrong quality of food is there, but the satisfaction of enjoying the food wasn't there because the thought of a roach! I'm sure other places I've eaten at are worst but I just can't over the fact that I saw one.

I don't know when or if I'll be back.. 
I just can't believe my first roach review was on a placed I liked .. :/"}
{"text":"Couldn't be happier that I could find this restaurant in Vegas.  

When we walked into the restaurant. It had funny smell. However, the hostesses made us so welcome and we had forgotten about it :) 

Lil who was our waitress, she was super awesome! She checked on us if we were doing ok. 

We ordered beef kalbi, sukiyaki bibimbap, mahi-mahi, shrimp, spicy pork, corn with butter and mushroom medleys. The bibimbap wasn't spicy at all, I requested for gochujang, which is like chilli paste. 

Although, we were so full but had to order taiyaki with ice cream. It is waffle with red bean filling and a side of mango ice cream. Lil had to change a new grill to grill it.  In my opinion, the taiyaki was just OK but the mango ice cream was sooo good."}
{"text":"We come here many time. But today we got the bad experince ever, the service is veryyyyyy slow. It take more than 15 minute for 3 order of beef tounge and they give us the wrong order. The server name Brian ( i read it from tag name ) he is not nice at all. He always fight with us, the drink never fill. The food its good. We love it. Only two star for Brian."}
{"text":"good lunch special and bbq combos. good variety of meat, pretty good quality of meat. good protein source."}
{"text":"Says open till 12:30 everyday, however they just pushed everyone out and refused to seat us at 11:15."}
{"text":"We've come back a couple of times and the service has gotten better.

They have lunch deals (until 2 or 3pm), happy hour deals (until 5) and for dinner you can get one of their course dinners (like the Geisha set).

The best value is the lunch combo, if you get the pieces of meat that would be normally expensive during dinner time, such as the hanger steak or the filet mignon. However if you get one of the cheaper meat choices for lunch, such as chicken, then you're not really getting a discount, because the lunch price is flat regardless of which meats you choose. There's a 2-meat option and a 3-meat option.

Oh they also have a rewards app"}
{"text":"Still great coming to this place, food is always good, top Quality Meats. Service can definitely use some work though."}
{"text":"Amazing! Service was awesome (there were 20+ of us, none of the servers seemed annoyed, we all paid separately). COME FOR THE LUNCH SPECIAL! 

The lunch special consists of rice, salad, soup (seaweed or miso) and either 2 meats and 3 meats. I opted for the 3 meat option at $15.95, only $3 more than the 2 meat option. Ordered the chuck short rib, hanger steak and pork toro. Wow were the portions huge. All the meat was fresh and well marinated, and the kitchen managed to have all our different meat dishes coming out at the same time. My favourite was the chuck short rib which was served in thin slices and so tender. The server told us all the different grill times when handing out each dish. The grills were also changed often which was greatly appreciated! Three sauces were available: ponzu, sweet soy and a red one tasting a bit like hoisin.

All of us now have nicely fulfilled our week's quota of meat, holy moley did we leave full. If you are not feeling particularly ravenous, the 2 meat option would be good.

P.S. Group gratuity is 20%."}
{"text":"Mon-Wed are all day happy hour! The food is great and the service is fantastic. Ask for Steven as your server! He was so very helpful!"}
{"text":"We went for the soft opening and the food was amazing as well as the service. We were 6 people and ordered from the à la carte menu instead of the set group menu. 

The food was fresh and the meat well marinated. Everything was tender and juicy. 

The place was clean and not too noisy. The staff were friendly and gave us advice on how much time we need to cook each plate to make it perfect. They also changed our grill several times throughout the evening even without us asking. 

Would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place for drinks and delicious food. If you want a bite for lunch or a nice dinner with friends, this is the place to go. Very spacious and pretty dim lighting but bright enough where you can read the menu. I've been here many times and I always order their tako wasabi, the portion is better than some places and their mushroom medley is delicious too, just make sure you don't leave it cooking for too long. 
Ive recommended this place to many friends and I've taken them here as well, and they tell me they bring their family here too which makes me happy that they enjoy this place just as much as I do. Also, download their app to receive points to get free appetizers, meats, or if you save up, $25 off your tab which is a great deal!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and loved it.  Pricey but worth it.  Each order is like 100g around 6-7 slices.  Too bad it is not charcoal like in Japan but this is the next best thing.  Meat is fresh but takes forever to come.  My flavor is the garlic filet mignon. So good I got 5 dishes last time.  Sign up for their app and you can get freebies easily.  Ps. Always make resveration here. I been here twice and I was seated within 10-15 mins while I hear people that walked in they been waiting for 1 hr or more or was turned away."}
{"text":"The excitement of a real Japanese BBQ place in Las Vegas was unreal to me and my boyfriend (who is Japanese). We were so excited to try this place out!

The entrance to this perceived Japanese   BBQ place is pretty amazing with its door framed lights, pretty befitting for it's placement in Las Vegas. 

However I would be stretching it by saying it should be categorized as a Japanese BBQ restaurant. There was definitely a DIY BBQ pit in the center of the table, which is always the expectation but the menu was not what we expected. The quality of the meats were good but very thick cuts for BBQ beefs and the lean meats. Also everything came pre-marinaded, which is something definitely not Japanese like plus the marinades were all very sweet for my taste. There were also lots of Korean dishes that also were on the menu, I felt this place was more of a Korean Japanese inspired BBQ restaurant and really should be categorized that way. 

Overall the service was great, quality of food good, happy hour is very reasonable, lots of speciality Asian inspired cocktails but undeniable not Japanese BBQ, it really missed it's mark by claiming itself as one."}
{"text":"I only come here for the happy hour. Super great price for drinks and appetizers. Don't really eat the bbq part though, but will have to try it next time."}
{"text":"The ambiance is very nice. The food and service is exceptional. The price however, a tad bit more than I expected. If you're looking to satisfy your stomach on a slight budget, this is not the place for you. If you're looking to fancy out and impress a girl on a date, then yes this place is a suitable option."}
{"text":"I didn't know what the deal was w/ Japanese BBQ since I thought it would be just alright but all of my friends kept talking about this place for awhile now so I finally tried it. I would highly recommend coming here on Monday or a Wednesday when they serve their happy hour menu all day. Their happy hour isn't just drinks but a good selection of meats and appetizers. I think this place is definitely worth for its happy hour prices , their regular prices are pretty expensive and that sht adds up quickly. They have an AYCE option (although more expensive than KBBQ AYCE) and your whole table needs to be doing that option too. From their happy hour menu I recommend ordering their Yaki shabu beef and toro beef. One of their cheaper options and actually still very very good. Bistro hanger steak is slightly more expensive than the other two but its another great option. Yet have to try their dessert options but I was waaay too full that time to order one."}
{"text":"Japanese BBQ where you grill your choices of quality meat at your table. Great selection of meats, thinly sliced and some are small steak bites and they have poultry and seafood for grilling as well. My absolute favorite is the Toro Beef Either white or sweet soy and the pork belly is amazing on the grill! First time I had thinly sliced beef tongue on the grill and it was amazing! I was afraid but the taste was amazing. The miso skirt steak and the garlic soy prime rib are to die for! You can't beat their lunch specials where you can pick 2-3 meats to grill and it comes with a salad, miso soup and rice for $9.95 or $12.95. And you can upgrade your rice to sukiyaki Bibimbap for $3 and believe me it is a MUST TRY!!!  we found Gyu-Kaku in San Diego and they had a AYCE special which was great for first timers to try a little bit of everything! Sadly the Las Vegas location doesn't have AYCE...YET! But they do have extended hours for 'Happy Hour' where they have discounted food & drinks! If going for dinner you will need to make reservation 2 hours in advance if possible. Our server today, Shane, was on point! He kept my hubby glass full, answered all of my questions and was very attentive and upbeat. Great service! I did advise the hostess that it took us 15mins of calling straight for someone to answer."}
{"text":"Happy hour after 830pm. Again happy hour for 2$50. With premium beef tough, Kobe beef, lamb sirloin. The service is awesome. Tuesday special is pint beer. Monday sake. Tuesday sake cocktail"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Make sure to reserve as this place is often very busy and I have seen them turn away costumes without reservations. Beef is so good but the pork was alright."}
{"text":"I had high hopes because I heard this place was great. I noticed how wrong I was from the time I walked through the doors to be seated.

We stood at the host stand for 2 minutes wondering if anyone was working. Saw the bartender and a couple of servers from where we were standing, but still no greeting towards us. Finally, the manager came out nonchalantly with no apology for us waiting, and casually brought us to our table which was still not clean. By not clean, I mean that it looked like someone just wiped the tabletop quickly and called it a day. There was a used napkin under the table from the previous guests, a vent had fallen off the grill which was laying at my feet, not to mention food crumbs. For how empty the restaurant was, I was dumbfounded that the attention to detail was lacking. I could see the same situation with food crumbs underneath other tables from where I was seated. Looked like they haven't cleaned and mopped their floors in god knows how long. Also, the 3 glass bottles on the table which housed the sauces for the meats were sticky and hadn't been wiped down either. Super gross.

I know the meats are usually pre-marinated, but I felt they were over-marinated and too salty. Not many vegetable options either.

Our server was nice, but nice doesn't cut it. He would disappear for lengths of time, especially after we were done with the meats. I didn't even bother to order dessert, and the check took forever to hit our table.

Won't recommend or be returning."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5 for our particular experiences here, but not good enough to round up for. Service is good and most dishes here are decent, but I found it telling that both the BF and I enjoyed the apps more than the actual meats we got here.

Definitely start with the SPICY CABBAGE SALAD, skip the miso soup. The \"spicy tuna volcano\" (AKA spicy tuna crispy rice, $4 for 4 pieces during HH) was not as good as others in town, but the shrimp ponzu tacos were crispy and adventurous.

As for the meats: choose 3/person and add a bowl of the GARLIC RICE to share. I love that it's served in stone bowl to crisp up and tossed tableside. Definitely get the TONGUE WITH SCALLION SAUCE and the GARLIC SHRIMP ($4 for 4 shrimp, currently on special, regularly $7). If you don't like garlic and onions, maybe don't bother because those were the best dishes.

Other solid options were the spicy gochugang pork belly, bistro hangar steak, toro beef, and basil chicken- all good but not great, smaller portions than other similar style restaurants for similar prices. 

Seems to be more of a place to go with a group and drink while lingering over the food, rather than as a date. The pre-set meals are well-priced for what you get, but they don't allow any substitutions. I don't see myself coming back outside of HH."}
{"text":"This is a very cute place! Try the coral reef cocktail and they also have smores!  Very friendly staff and the food is delicious. They come in smaller portions so u can order a variety of food. They also have a point system where u can rack up points for free food later! Would definitely come again"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this new place for awhile now, today I finally got a reservation for four. We were seated quickly had an amazing server that was attentive and always coming to check on us, refilling our drinks to changing our plates. When I first walked in the door, it reminded me of a Korean restaurant the smell and the small BBQ pit in the middle of each table and each table has a selection of three sauces Sweet Soy, Ponzu & Spicy (wish they had more unique sauces). 
We were overwhelmed by their menu selections so we decided to order a party combo 'Samurai for 4' then added a few extra dishes. Pork Toro, Duck Breast, Sweet Onions, Spinach Garlic & Fried Bacon Chips. The Harami Miso Steak was really good flavorful and the Miso really works with it. The Duck Breast was not that great no flavor to it. The best dishes were the Harami Steak, Chicken Thigh Basil, Filet Mignon, Kalbi Short Ribs, Garlic Shrimp, Pork Belly & Garlic Noodles. The Veggies I had issues with, the eggplant had no marinade so it was really dry and almost chewy, The Spinach Garlic was a joke, there were so little of it that only 2.....2 people got to try it. They both got so little themselves it was not even a tablespoon each. The onions you have to pay for which I think it should be included in the meat dishes. At this point I thought it was better at a Korean Restaurant cause they always throw in onions and mushrooms. The only differences between the two culture foods is the selection of meats and veggies. The total cost for 4 people was $45/pp with no alcoholic drinks and no desserts, all 4 of us had sodas with free refills. This is a great place for socialising with friends and just relaxing and having a good time. This place is very popular with the young office crowd. Lunch is always packed, reservation is strongly suggested. Overall I would rate this place a 3/5. Again great hang out but can be pricey. Keep in mind this is a tapas restaurant."}
{"text":"Terrible and slow service. How do you fail a Gyu-Kaku? You're barely cooking. You literally have to give us raw meat. And you fail that? 

We ordered the combo for 2 people... the food was great, no problem about the food (I cooked most of it anyways) but the service was absolutely terrible. The guy was nice but being nice doesn't get you too far if you can't do your job. 

We didn't get our waters refilled NOT ONCE. I ended up drinking my sons water in his kid cup because I didn't have water. We needed forks for the kids, asked for forks, he forgot.. we asked again... he forgot again. We ended up walking to the kitchen and asking for forks. 

It took about 15-20 min to bring our meats out... we were the only ones in the restaurant. It wasn't like they were busy. How is it gonna take long to bring out raw meat on plates? 

Then we asked for a second round of meat halfway through our meal, and they didn't come out until we were ready to leave. We ended up canceling the meat. 

Our edamame came to our table about 5 minutes before we left. Our food was eaten already. EDAMAME IS AN APPETIZER. How can you not even bring edamame on time??? 

We won't be back. At least not to this location."}
{"text":"When my boyfriend and I first heard that Gyu-Kaku was opening up in Toronto, we were beyond excited. He had a wonderful experience at this Japanese BBQ chain restaurant in San Francisco, so we were looking forward to enjoying the same quality food!

First thing we noticed when we walked in was how stuffy it was inside - they really need better ventilation, especially in the summer time. We were seated and ordered the Meat Lover's combo with a side order of the premium steak. It was all downhill from there, in part due to the horrendous service we got from our waitress (or lack thereof to be honest).

Our meal began with some edamame, salad, chicken karaage, and rice - the appetizers all tasted decent. We asked for water but had to remind the waitress twice. We then got three of the meats that came with the combo along with corn. The beef ribs and steak were pretty good, but not surprising that the corn tasted canned. When we were done with these items, the waitress came around and asked us if we wanted to order anything else as it was last call for the night. We were confused because our combo was supposed to come with six different meat dishes but we only got three, not to mention we had ordered a side of the premium steak. She insisted that all of the items had come out already but we showed her the menu and politely asked her to check again. She ended up coming back with more plates of meat, saying that they had been \"sitting\" in the kitchen...

When we were done with all the food, we asked for the bill and again we had to wait quite a long time. When she finally came back, she explained that it was a very busy night for her and complained that she had been assigned to serve several tables that night - the restaurant definitely didn't appear understaffed so I'm not sure why she made it seem like she had to do more than expected. We also didn't appreciate her blaming her job for the poor service.

Needless to say, dinner was disappointing and we definitely won't be coming back to this particular restaurant. However we would still consider trying out the other locations around the world. If you're looking for Japanese BBQ and happen to be uptown, I would say that Gyubee in Markham is similar but tastes better (plus it's all-you-can-eat)."}
{"text":"Service was pretty consistent and fast. Food was nothing special to me, but pretty filling nonetheless. Not really a place I'd suggest in this area unless you're looking for ramen or soup. I'd recommend Mean Bao or Karine's if anything which are pretty closeby."}
{"text":"We love this place! Very consistent quality of food and service. People seem happy working there, which is a big plus for the business. And as a BBQ lover, it is such a elegant place to have a feast without coming out smelling like you've been grilled too. Zero smoke high tech griller made in Japan, makes me wanna have one at home!! The meat quality is great! So are the vegetables. The noodles and other side dishes are tasty too! Great for group hangout. They open all day, so convinient especially for late lunch after a weekend shopping date."}
{"text":"I give this place 2 stars only because of our waiter. As gyu Kaku regulars my bf and I love their HH and the food. We stopped on a sat afternoon on a road trip from Southern California and decided this was a good spot to refuel and have dinner. There was 1 older gentleman as our waiter, serving 4 tables (we were one of them). Our meat took much longer than we have ever had to wait..and it was HH portions. We were first served our veggies- corn and spinach. Consumed that and our meat was still not served. Finally our meat arrived. Just one 6 slices of garlic steak. Our next 2 orders did not arrive until let's put it this way- the grill was already burnt and charred.  Those next two orders of meat were hard to even flip over, again, obviously because the grill was burnt and charred! We alerted our waiter, asking if we can change grill, and he just lowered the temperature of the grill. That was pretty annoying, esp since we are regulars at this place and our waiters change our the grill even before we have to ask. To be honest, after sitting in the car for a road trip for 4 hours and not having the normal practice standards of this establishment was quite annoying! This waiter needs to keep up with this place or management will be (if not already) hearing ALOT of complaints since this place gets busy."}
{"text":"I love the whole idea gyu kaku has, the cook your own meats but the meats are also a lot better quality than most Korean BBQ around in Vegas. In fact I think this is the only Japanese BBQ and the pricing id say is $-$$ so not bad!
Around 11 pm - close you best go in for their happy hour! A lot of the stuff is way cheaper and you can get way more appetizers or you can choose the combos where they come with all these picked meats for certain pricing. I love the ambience you never feel rushed to eat, but sometimes you feel the service is slow too. The customer service though has always been good everytime I eat here and at least they check up on us occasionally. I think the fact you take time to cook your food is what fills you up quicker. My favorite meats are the filet mignon, the Cajun shrimp, the butterfish, and the salmon (fish person much? I know lol.) anyways if you want dessert they also have macaron ice cream sandwiches! They're so cute haha and there's like 4 different flavors. I'd say you'd best take your date here or double date! It's the perfect place to go!"}
{"text":"I've always loved the japanese bbq here! The staff always greets you as you come through the door and it makes you feel right at home. We came here during happy hour and so we had gotten a nice discount.

Anything we ordered came out very fast and all the cuts of meat tasted fresh and well marinated. I love that our server would constantly check and change our grill if it needed to be.
No complaints here, if you haven't experienced Japanese bbq, I would recommend this place as a good start!"}
{"text":"I really want to try out this new Japanese beef grill place, and it sure did not disappoint.  The wait was little bit of a pain since there was a 30 minutes wait; however, me and couple other friends were not in a rush, so it was fine.  I went to the neighbouring Starbuck and enjoyed the new ice hibiscus concotion.  After around 25 minutes, I recieved an automatic text stating that the table was ready.  It was fine and dandy, and the hostess took us to our table.  As I was sitting inside, I realized that Japanese really know how to set the mood for the restaurant.  The music was at a nice volume, the tables were all really clean, and even the grill was spotless.  

I was extremely satisfied with their cleanliness.  Beside this, their customer service was just excellent.  For me, I felt their service is even better than some fine dining restaurant where I have to pay at least $100 per head.  I was really happy since we were attended to numerous time just at the right moment throughout our lunch.  She patiently went thru to explain the ENTIRE menu to us, and she was really knowledgeable about each item.  After contemplating for a while, we decided to get the samarai combo for two and 3 items combo for one.  This way, we maximize the variety of meats we can try.  We actually did the math beforehand.  So, it will be around $25 per person with tax and 15% tips.  Btw, tips is not included in the bill, don't feel pressure to tip 15%.

All the marinated beef and pork were of high quality and freshness.  A friend was really enjoying being the chef of the table, so that's a big bonus.  All the meats were grilled to perfection.  I enjoyed the fillet maignon, pork belly and the garlic marinated shrimp.  The highlight of the day was the beef tongue, it has a little chewiness with full beef flavours.  Even the starter salad was really good, and the salad dressing was really flavorful with a creamy texture.   

By the end of the meal, we had two large scoops of matcha and sesame icecream.  They were really good also.  I was happy that I got enrolled into their lucky draw for $1000 sweepatake.  Yeah! If I win, I will treat all my friends to come to this wonderful restaurant.  lol!

I was really happy, full and relax after the meal.  It was $25 extremely well spent.  I will definitely come back shortly."}
{"text":"Walked in at 5ish and there was no wait.
Not officially open thus set menus and beer have discounts.
Service was excellent!
The four of us ordered one premium meat lover set (for 2) plus some appetizers, meats and drinks and we were full at the end.
Recommend: premium beef tongue (a must), kalbi short rib sweet soy, NY steak miso, corn, sukiyaki bibimbap 
Needs improvement: the drinks taste watery and the maple syrup ice cream was toooo sweet!
Price was about $35/ person , very seasonable I would say"}
{"text":"Amazing and absolutely delicious menu with great service to match! The use of an app to collect points and redeem rewards is a nice perk for repeat visits! And you will definitely want to come back for more!
The restaurant itself is conveniently located and clean. The ambience in the restaurant is good too, not too noisy."}
{"text":"3.5. I'm a fan, but with reserved feelings. 

Gyu Kaku is good, great even, and I say it's definitely worth a try. But please be warned that it doesn't really have much in terms of originality or value. 

Gyu Kaku is Japanese Korean BBQ restaurant. Oh wait sorry, it's only referred to as \"Japanese BBQ\". But... wait again... What exactly is Japanese BBQ? What's the difference from the Korean BBQ style? Well, I looked it up for you: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakiniku

It seems like the origin of Yakinuku was heavily influenced by Korean BBQ anyways. To me, the major difference sounds like that the meats are more beef oriented and vegetables are cooked alongside the meats instead of served as a cold side dish a la the Koreans.

Gyu Kaku offers value meal combos as well as ordering from a la carte. For the value meals, they pre-select certain meats and vegetables as a packaged well balanced meal. However, we ordered from the a la carte menu instead. We felt like the value savings was in their salads and soups anyways and gosh darn it, we came for meats and not rabbit food! (Plus we get to try everything we actually wanted)

We had: 

1) Harami miso skirt
2) Bistro hanger steak
3) Filet mignon 
4) New York steak
5) Toro beef
6) Pork belly
7) Enoki Mushrooms 
8) Sukiyaki beef bibibap

Lets just say that their BEST item is by far that Sukiyaki beef bibibap. It was delicious. We only got one, and heavily regretted not getting one each. We ended up having to get two extra rices anyways. Heavily recommended as a MUST TRY. 

The harami skirt, hanger steak, New York steak and filet mignon were all fairly similar. They were all delicious, but wasn't as unique tasting as the restaurant wants you to think with the fancy marinate labelling. 

Our first piece of meat that we grilled was a piece of filet mignon. It literally stuck onto the grill because it was so lean and dry. The best tasting meat was the toro beef (which by the way, just means fatty beef) because it was the the thinnest while containing the most fat content. 
The mushrooms were also tasty, and it was nice to have a packet of tin foiled mushroom covered in butter thrown onto the grill to enjoy. Be warned though, portions here are not big. 

Service at the restaurant is so-so. I'll admit I've never had a white person serve me at an Asian BBQ restaurant yet but hey, western fusion is the trend in Toronto right? Gotta keep up with Guu, Kanpai, Nome and Lee.  In this case, the service was a bit raw. The server was super friendly but had a couple hiccups such as saying all our food came when it hadn't, the lemon water was just water with a piece of lemon on the side (lol) and she failed to mention that they had a opening special price on their value combos.  The biggest concern was the speed of foods coming out of the kitchen was very slow. I mean, c'mon, it's RAW foods you're handing out...

The table comes with three extra sauces: sweet, spicy and ponsu. Sweet sauce is very similar to teriyaki (actually I'm convinced that it's 100% teriyaki, but the restaurant does not want you thinking that). I found the spicy and teriyaki sauce went the best together as the ponsu had a bit of a tangy taste that didn't quite fit well on my amateur palate.

Overall, the restaurant is worth a try. It's a good casual place for a hangout for friends or a casual date. I wouldn't recommend it if you're very hungry, since the portions are not that big. They have an opening special discount right now. 20% off on a la carte items and their combo meals. I don't know when this discount ends. There is no happy hour since they are offering this discount. The wait times were long. We got lucky as we arrived at 5:10 on Friday and were seated at 5:30 but we noticed that the group directly after us were seated after 6pm."}
{"text":"I went here three days ago for my first time and I will definitely be coming back. This is going to be a regular return place for me hands-down! I gave it one star for the atmosphere which was spacious and had an Asian yet contemporary design, lighting was perfect for dining and also dim enough for intimacy.  I gave one star for the service which was excellent; our server was attentive and friendly without being intrusive.  I give one star for the prices. We had a satisfying sized portion lunch special with variety at a very decent price of $12.95.  One star for the quality of food. The miso soup was the standard of tofu and a little green onion but it was done right - not too salty. The salad had a nice dressing that was light. The portion of rice was perfect and cooked just right. The meats that we grilled were excellent and quality and flavor. The dining experience itself will bring me back more than once and so that is my final star!!"}
{"text":"It's always a pleasure to come here - I mean you can't deny and say no to good cuts of meat(especially to hardcore carnivores),but there's always great energy and the staff is perfectly attentive. I could talk about the superb food, but tonight, the experience was more than delightful - Our server was perfectly attentive and adorable as she catered to me, my partner, our friend, and his two young boys. Long story short, a 1 year old and a 4 year old with an abundance of energy, and liquids were spilling left and right and high pitched sounds galore. Nonetheless, she was efficient, sincere, and interacted well with the boys. Anyhoo, these type of interactions should never go unnoticed. 5 stars yo... looking forward to the next outing here"}
{"text":"Have been here several times, amazing food and friendly service! Also can download the apps and get more discount!"}
{"text":"I am REALLY glad we came here. I was reluctant to come because we had our son with us and from seeing the crowd the night before I was not too sure it was for kids. Well we had a great experience. All of the servers were super nice and accommodating. The food was delicious. We have a place on Queen St in Toronto but it's nothing like this. I inquired as to if there was one in Toronto and low and behold there is. I will so be there. Once again this place redeemed this type of BBQ style cooking for me because my first experience was in Toronto was horrible. If you get a chance come here. I! All about customer service and this place hit and exceeded every mark. Great food, great service!"}
{"text":"Wow. This is the most premium beef and BBQ place I've been to so far. The service is quick, but they don't throw everything right onto your table from the start... They portion control it and wow... What a difference that makes. Will definitely come back here to try something else and also for a party of some sort!"}
{"text":"This place is TERRIBLE.  From some of the other reviews, I'm not the only person who has gotten food poisoning from their meats here.  I eat rare steaks pretty often, so my body can handle a little rareness, but after eating here, my stomach has been turning for the past few days.  After several reviews that mention food poisoning and hair found in their food...cleanliness doesn't seem to be one of their main priorities here.  I sincerely hope it doesn't turn out like another Firefly's fiasco.

Besides that, the special drinks they have looked like it was created by a 12 year old.  I'll stick to the Sapporo...which by the way was a bit on the warm side.  

The service was a bit \"meh.\"  I understand its a new restaurant and all, but the servers were inattentive and some of them looked confused even.  Not a very well organized restaurant in my opinion, and definitely needs a LOT of improvement to live up to the Gyu Kaku namesake.  I've eaten at the ones in Japan and I was SO looking forward to this one popping up in Vegas.  This was a complete let down.  

I usually don't write reviews, but this place deserves the ONE STAR I'm giving.  If I could give it ZERO, I would.  I'm not sure why the others gave it 3 stars when you're finding hair in the food and also getting sick from the food here."}
{"text":"Super chill good vibe, nice ambiance... our server Ryan is awesome fast and entertaining, and the food was great. we went during happy hour so thats a plus! I'd deff come here again"}
{"text":"Just like back home in Hawaii! Food was delicious and about the same price. Parking was free, location was easy to find. Staff was friendly and well mannered and quick to re fill drinks, change grill tops, move dishes and the location was busy that night so i was very shocked to see how well they did."}
{"text":"Montreal' s got a new PF Chang's.. I mean wait a minute Gyu Kaku. (Pun intended). I've been to the other locations of this chain in the US-this location can not compare in decor, portions of the quality of food (I mean that in a negative). This place looked more like a fast food chain (like PF Chang's) but more of a reason to try it out. 

Location: can't get better, located corner St catherine and crescent (the so cold party street of Montreal acclaimed by tourists). It's literally located right beside the 3 brasseurs on the corner.

Decor: a lot more industrial grunge look-the word that summarizes it a retired concrete jungle turned into your Japanese BBQ restaurant.

Food: I was smart to go with one of the other Elites who pointed out the \"happy hour\" Mondays specials. Basically there are discounts on a selected number of items on the menu, so it was a smart choice to go a la carte vs a combo for 2. The final bill came out to 35$ each with tax with a pitcher of Sapporo for 14$, solid steal. Items that I really enjoyed: Kimchi and the beef cuts (especially the Toro beef). All cuts were really tender and we'll seasoned. There is also 3 types of The not so hot items: volcano tuna appetitzer(something wrong with warm creamy tuna on a large tater tot), classic Bibimbop-soundd like the Hansen brothers song right lol  (a Korean rice dish often found in Japan, my server smashed it before I could even appreciate the the dish :( but it lacked meat and vegetables, it was purely rice), lastly the smores were not worth 2.50$ the crackers were stale and the marshmallow never heated up!

Service: Matthew (our waiter) you will make a phenomenonal computer scientist but I also think you are now my gold standard of how every student server should be. Lively, honest about which dishes you enjoyed and personable. I asked Matthew to call his manager, Jimmy, over so I could commend the management at the restaurant. He didn't even bother stopping by, odd.. Very odd indeed.

Overall: not the top Gyu Kaku restaurant in my viewpoint but it is exciting to see more US businesses expand over to our turf like this one. The app is a cute addition as well, a point collection system to earn free items and gift certificates!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times since it's my favorite BBQ spot in Vegas. Love, love, love the atmosphere since I'm really into restaurants with a modern, upscale social vibe that plays house music (kinda specific, I know).

Don't walk in expecting to become super full unless you have a small stomach or are ready to shell out some money! I think around $20-25 per person would be good to adequately fill someone up. I always /have/ to get a bowl of rice in order to help fill me up when I usually don't get one,

For the appetizers, my favorites are the Ahi Tuna Poke, Spicy Tuna Volcano, & Wakame Seaweed Salad. It's been a while since I've had the Ahi Tuna and the Spicy Tuna, but I remember that I definitely enjoyed those the most. Out of all of the meats I've tried, the Toro Beef & the Harami Miso Skirt Steak are definitely my favorites. The Harami definitely has the most flavor out of the ones I've tried. Honestly, all the meats are packed with a lot of flavor; however, I remember the New York Steak not being too special for me. If I had to suggest meats for first timers, get the Harami, Toro Beef, Bistro Hanger Steak, & Filet Mignon.

The price is a little too high for me with the portions that are given for each item, but the quality is definitely there. They also provide sweet soy, spicy, and ponzu sauces for your meat, but you don't really need it since you don't have to worry about the meat not having any flavor.

I can't see myself going to Gyu-Kaku unless it's during Happy Hour since the price/portion ratio seems a little off to me. Kudos for having a Gyu-Kaku app to collect reward points to redeem for future visits! Definitely scan all of your receipts every time you go here since every little point counts. Every time I go back, I always get a free Toro Beef since I keep scanning my receipts from the last visit."}
{"text":"The meat was practically melt in your mouth if grilled right (I only had the beef so I have no say on their chicken, pork, chicken, or shrimp which my friends had). 

I highly recommend the Meat lover set next time because that's what I'd like to try out hahah. I don't really know what to say, their cuts and meat selection have left me speachless because I really only ever want to eat meat here LOL. No matter how you grill it to your liking youre going to love the decadent buttery or bloody taste in your mouth, melting away all of your worries.

The salad and veggies were okay, but I really loved the spicy tofu. I would definately order the spicy tofu again for the interesting crunchy textures of the kimchi and pepperflakes paired with the creamy and cold tofu.

The cocktails were more like juice but maybe thats the alcoholic in me talking hahaha. I did find the Samurai Sake drink more refreshing than the Tequila Sunrise.

Verdict: If I could eat here everyday I could."}
{"text":"I went to this place few months ago and I decided to not coming back but I went to one time few days ago for my friend (she was craving yakiniku but Yagyu closed down for bbq thats why) and it was horrible experience with them again.

So heres my story why I was disappointed to them at first.

At a First,exteriors&interiors are awesome with the lights
Service was great but quality of meats are HORRIBLE.
Colors of meats are grossly dark.
No marblings at all. 
Tastes are gross.
So me&my friend decided to drink beer instead of eating that gross foods.
But there was an happy hour for beer allyoucandrink, the manager (he called his self manager) never tell us they have offers for drinks.
Cause he want us to pay double whenever we order beers. So stupid.
We sat about 30mins, they force us to pay and get  out the restaurant.(there was many tables include us,and it was only10pm) Even though my beers just got opened. If you guys gonna close soon and gonna let us kick out,then why you take the orders for beer?? not giving services and foods but wants money from customer?
Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Arrived at 5:30pm, waited 50minutes when there were at least 7 open tables (one big table can fit 8guests).
First, Host told us the kitchen was busy, so she did not want to sit us at the table yet? 
After 25mins of wait, she said the same thing again. I suggested that it would make much more sense to sit us, so we can start getting something to drink. 
(Kitchen is busy, so we can't get seated and get water at least??) you must be kidding...

Work in busy F&B establishment for a few years and never seen this kind of disaster before.

Even funnier, host seated a group of 2 arrived after my group. 

Did not see anyone trying to resolve the problem, so we decided to walk out of the place.

**Worst Experience I have ever had**

Management did not step in nor did other staff tried to communicate with us."}
{"text":"Where do I start? There is a whole list of complaints. I'm giving them two stars because the food was actually good. We went with the ayce. The meats were very flavorful, tender and delicious. Now let's move on to the service. When we arrived, we literally stood there for 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged that we were there. Second our service at the table was horrible. Anyone that knows me, knows I value customer service. We had to ask for spoons, sweeteners, forks, and napkins repeatedly. It took 20 minutes before we actually saw those items. I had to ask a bus person finally. When the waiter spilled my drink on me, I blew it off. Accidents happen right? But from that moment on, everything went down hill. They took forever bringing the food out to us. Given the fact it was a little busy, we blew that off too. But the worst part of it all.... wait for it ... we had to wait 40 minutes for our checks to get right. And when I say get right, he came to us and asked how we were paying. We had to split it 3 ways. Our waiter literally acted as if we asked for something illegal. He went away to \"handle \" our check. He was gone for 25 minutes. 25 minutes!! It finally took a manager to go over there and help him with the check. Then they had the nerve to add on another $14 per group for gratuity. That's $42 in tip for poor and I mean extremely poor service. Needless to say, thanks to my friend we had that taken off. Normally I would give a place a second chance but we will definitely not be going back to this place!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now and choose the grill tables. It's fun to cook with friends. They season the food really well so it's always been tasty. Both servers I had were friendly and helpful when we had cooking questions. They have great happy hour deals too."}
{"text":"AWESOME, just AWESOME!  Ordered the surf and turf for 2 $77 - and it filled three of us.  We did order some bacon scallops, pork belly and mushrooms on the side - ended up being ALOT, but ate it all.  Everything, and I mean everything is delicious.  
The place is jamming, loud, fun, friendly - I did the app download for the points you can earn for free food - we'll be there enough, for sure!  Big parking lot, clean, fun, full bar, you will have a great time here!"}
{"text":"I was so excited when I found out Gyu-kaku was out here. It's one of my favorite places to eat. To top it off, down the street from my hotel. Service was quick and awesome. Meats were good cuts and flavors were yummy. Happy hour is totally legit. Make sure you top your meal off with their delicious macaron ice cream sandwiches."}
{"text":"So glad we called before coming because it was shortly after they opened on a Thursday and it was already quite busy. I overheard people waiting when we left had about an hour to go.

The service is very friendly - our server was very polite and explained how long to cook each item as she dropped it off. The manager visited our table twice throughout the course of our meal, which was nice. The staff work as a team and cleared our plates away if they walked by and saw we were finished with a dish.

We ordered the Geisha plus a few additional items for variety. Took advantage of the $2 Sapporo ($5 after the first round) and were happily full after. The meats were delicious and the shrimp were huge! Some notes: the miso soup could use some salt/flavour, the namuru plate was also disappointing and lacked seasoning. I didn't like the salad dressing since it tasted like a vinegar-y mayo. Definitely worth it to get the crispy garlic/chili sauce for $1 as well as the scallion sauce. We ended up mixing those two with everything and it was deeeelish!! It was fun to toast our own marshmallows for the dessert s'mores and I loved that our server changed the grill before we switched to sweets! Great touch!

Overall, it was good and I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"First time here and it was absolutely delicious! They offer AYCE with a variety of meats and all are full of flavor! You don't need to drench them in sauce like other places. 

They have an app and rewards program which is great especially for locals. 

Yoshi was our server and was awesome. He was efficient and always checking up on our table. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Now that's BBQ. This place is awesome.  The bartender greeted me at the door.  Mention the happy hour specials. I told him I was there for the BBQ .walked me to a BBQ table, and that was it.  

Yoshi, was great. Service and recommendations. 

Great food, music, mood, theme, service and drinks. Will definitely be back and will tell my friends."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!  Loved the gyu-kaku course (on weekends it's 20% off as well). Loved all the components especially the rice pot it came with and all of the meats, maybe minus the chicken but I'm a bit biased of chicken at any Grill place. It never tastes quite right.  

We also got the bacon wrapped asparagus and the kobe duo which were both so worth it.  If I could do it over I would have just seared the meat on both sides, quality of meat was great and is best rare.  Also we didn't use any sauces which is saying something.  Everything was seasoned so well.  

If we didn't get the course we never would have tried most of the things we loved so highly recommend it especially for first timers like us!  Service was great, Yoshi was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"This place is damn solid. 

Reminds me almost exactly of Japanese BBQ! 

The food was not only good, but also very well priced. 

All 3 of us were full, for about $60 ish. 

They are as authentic as it gets in vegas. 
The meat assortment even had tongue, liver and tripe!

The meats were all good, especially the harami. (My recommendation.)

Things to steer away from: basil chicken, ice cream macaron sandwiches. 

Yoshi was our waiter, and he was amazing. 
Attentive, friendly, and Japanese! 

I highly recommend this place, especially for their happy hour. 
It's the perfect place to grab an early meal and some beer. 

P.S. they have a livingsocial deal floating around, and it seems like an amazing deal."}
{"text":"Love love love love this place. We come at least once a week for one of the most kick-ass happy hours in town. Be sure to try the Prime Garlic Shoyu Steak, Bistro Hangar Steak and my personal favorite, the spicy pork. Ask for Ryan, Lily or Yoshi, the best servers in the Valley!"}
{"text":"Situated in a shopping center at the corner of Decatur Blvd and Spring Mountain Rd, it'd be impossible to drive by this place and not notice its entryway especially when lit at night.  Interior was nicely decorated with a fusion of traditional and modern Japanese elements throughout.  Music, on the other hand, can be overbearing as EDM blast through the speakers.  Nonetheless, ambiance is perfect for a date night or dinner with a group of friends.

Haven't really considered of going back to any KBBQ joints since dining at this restaurant for the first time!  Consider it some sort of awakening due to the array of items one can enjoy in such great quality.  No AYCE here but they do offer different full course dinners priced at $55, $66 and $77 that can easily feed 2-4 people.  They also have Happy Hour specials from 1700-1830 and 2100-closing with several discounted items from the menu.

One thing I'd like to point out is how awesome their grills are.  Small vents actually surround the cooking area which makes the smoke dissipate before it can even engulf guests so they don't end up smelling like grilled meat afterwards.

We usually opt for their meat lover's course which is a great way to sample different cuts of meat in various marinades.  The meal starts out with miso soup and house salad as well cheese wontons and garlic fried chicken.  The spread is then followed by the main entree comprised with six different meat items.  To top it all off, s'mores to end the dinner; grill comes off so guests can toast marshmallows straight on the heat.

Overall, Gyu-Kaku is definitely the better alternative to KBBQ...better yet, a great replacement if I must say.  Top notch food quality and superb customer service.  Can't wait for our next meal in this establishment!

P.S. THEY SERVE LADY M MILLE CRÊPE CAKES!!  They only offer green tea flavor but oh so worth it!!"}
{"text":"Been to Gyukaku Hawaii and loved it so thought we'd give Gyu-kaku LV a try. We were there for the 1700-1830 happy hour which is the real steal (they also have a 2100 happy hour) The prices are decent at happy hour and the mains are on the happy hour menu -- kal bi, skirt steak, shrimp, poke, sushi, etc. However they also have a $55 Meat Lovers combo which was comparable to all of the hh items we purchased. 

The best thing I had all night was the spicy ahi volcano complete with crispy rice. Worst was the ahi poke. But of course nothing compares to the way poke is served in Hawaii.

Service was ok. The manager checked on us, and the waiter was as attentive as he could be being the only one waiting on everyone in the restaurant at the time. 

All in all -- Korean BBQ reigns over gyu-kaku japanese bbq"}
{"text":"This is my first Japanese grill. Usually I go to the Korean bbq at Tofu Hut or Bo Nuong Vi at Pho So 1. This is really good. The beef is premium meat. The flavor is unique and so good. I do like the plain meat at Tofu Hut too but the seasoning at Gyu Kaku has a different kick to the meat. Love the grill and the temperature of it. This is the best grill I have used so far. Miso soup included in the group selection that we picked. It is small but it's comfortable. Overall the atmosphere is high end and not in the hole even when the Decatur x Spring Mountain is in the hole corner. Whoever did the decoration did a pretty good job. Come at night inside and you won't see Spring Mountain as an in the hole street.

Happy Hours are good hours, but Lunch hours are Very Happy Hours. It's $8 to start for the lunch and that's with 3 meat, salad, miso, and rice. Yeh!!! Awesomely Happy. With the 10% local discount, it's Screaming Happy. AAAAAAHHHHHHHH!"}
{"text":"If i could give this place 0 stars i would! The food is terrible and extremely overpriced. There is nothing special about this food, the only thing fancy about this place is the name. Do yourself a favor, skip this gimmick and  eat at Bellagio, i could have done just that with the money i spent here."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend and friends for lunch. The food was comparable to the Philly location but the staff were definitely nicer here. We got the premium happy hour special and it included but seafood and beef which was a nice change. 

The menu here is more extensive and had more options. The prices were pretty good compared to typical California prices. 

The food was okay. The rice was dry. And the meat was over marinated and chewy. We had to remind them to oil our hot plate a few times and they kind of left us alone until they brought us the next dishes. Nothing to impressive on the BBQ end. The smores were the best part!"}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite places. Always make it a todo item when ever I'm in Calgary. 

Portions are on the smaller end, so we typically get the dinner for 6, for a party of 4. 

The meats are well seasoned, and almost never need the sauces on the side to be added. Although personally I am not a big fan of the chicken, simply because it's the easiest one to mess up when cooking. But when it's cooked properly, it's delicious.

The Black sesame mochi is my favorite desert from here. 

Service is friendly, and if you make a reservation ahead of time, or for later in the evening, there shouldn't be any issues. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Soo is an attentive, caring, enthusiastic waitress that served me today. 

Monday & Wednesday - Happy Hour ALL DAY. 

Tuesday & Thursday - Happy Hour 1230-630 PM & 9-12 AM. 
 
Great environment. And the barbecue courses are an amazing steal!"}
{"text":"I've been to Gyu-Kaku in downtown Calgary twice for dinner.  Japanese BBQ is always fun!  

Atmosphere: 4/5  Modern, neat and relaxed atmosphere.  Tables were big enough to accommodate all the food with a grill in the middle.  It was not too hot or cold, and the restaurant was generally well ventilated.  Located conveniently in downtown Calgary

Food: 4/5  The first time I came, we had the Geisha for 2, one of their 'value BBQ courses for 2 people.'  There was definitely enough food for the two of us.  The tuna tataki and filet mignon were probably my favorite items.  I like that this course also came with some vegetables like the mushroom medley and spinach garlic. Finishing off with s'mores was great - I haven't had one in a really long time!  The second time I came, we were not that hungry so decided to order a la carte.  Unfortunately some of the items we wanted to try were not available.  We ended up getting orders of harami miso skirt steak, bistro hanger steak, pork belly, gyu kaku salad and shrimp garlic noodles.   It was also possible to substitute some of the marinades.  Overall, the items were all quite tasty.  I would've probably liked a little less marinade but I also prefer blander food hahaha...

Service: 4/5  The waiters were very knowledgeable and great at explaining how do-it-yourself BBQ worked.  They even gave specific times for cooking the various items, which we tried hard to remember.  Overall friendly and efficient service.  It can get quite busy so reservations are definitely advised

Price: 3/5  Can get a bit pricey for dinner but you can always go during happy hour when they have some deals

Overall: 4/5  I enjoyed my Japanese BBQ experience!  It was neat to find something like this in downtown Calgary.  I would probably return during lunch or happy hour to try some of their other items."}
{"text":"Great happy hour special! Friendly staff and pretty decent food

The Ramen is on the bland side and doesn't come with egg, so ordering the other specials will be more worth while for your money."}
{"text":"The happy hour menu was amazing! Just enough food for two people. Great value, superb flavors in the meat. You don't smell like BBQ after eating here! Gave me free ice cream for my birthday!"}
{"text":"The rice bowls are to die for!  Yum, yum, yum!  So much fun to bring good friends, and have some great food & drinks!"}
{"text":"What a great hidden gem. A finee looking Japanese  restaurant with low pruces. 
We heard so much about it, had to try it out. 
Shane our waiter was awesome, had happy hour appetizers  and the special rybeye steak for 7.99.  
Shane suggested the green tea ice cream sandwich. Wow. 
Fabulous dishes, great flavor and loved the prices. 
Shane made our day. 
We have gone back 3 times this week. 
The Manage Sheri Lynn is attentive and checked on us often. 

Ya'll have to try this restaurant."}
{"text":"Our friends were raving about this place and I'm glad they brought us! Awesome food and service was great! We were waiting to be sat for a couple of minutes so we hit up the bar for a drink. The gentleman behind the bar was super friendly and attentive. He later came by our table and asked us how everything was. Since I have worked in restaurants before I am all about the service anywhere I go and they really impressed me. I wish I could remember what we ordered but our friends who are much more familiar with the food did all the ordering. Everything was great, will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Come for happy hour! It's actually worth your buck. Half priced drinks and discounted meats! 

The grill here is great! The air vent is in the grill so you won't leave smelling like BBQ. 

So ordered off the hour and regular menu. Most of the meats were overly marinaded and sweet. Which I didn't like. I really liked the harami and kalbi. The Kobe style flat iron steak was very dry. It was like a dried carne sada without the marinade. 

We also order a full house salad which was very small for the price $5.50. The cheese corn was good but SERIOUSLY felt skimped on corn. It was only like 2 tablespoons in the foil for $5? 

We got s'mores at the end and that was fun to eat! I would def recommend only ordering off happy hour
And you'll leave more satisfied."}
{"text":"DLW and I arrived in Toronto on a Thursday evening for a short vacation, and needed some dinner desperately. This place presented itself on our Yelp search, and our love of Japanese/Korean barbecue settled it.

The place was busy even on a weeknight, and we had a 20 minute wait before being seated. Every table is set up as a barbecue table, unlike lots of places which only have a limited number of grill tables. Our fabulous waiter with the Aussie accent recommended the Premium Meat Lovers dinner, but that seemed a bit much even for our state. We had the regular Meat Lovers, which was plenty. Plenty delicious, too. Five kinds of beef, plus pork for the grill, and salad, edamame, kara-age, and rice beforehand. Ice cream for dessert also included. We really need one of these near us ASAP."}
{"text":"I don't get all the open tables and an hour wait. If there are reservations ok but during my meal the whole front stayed empty.  Wrong way to control labor costs.  If that is not it, the FOH is ruining you, hurting the guest experience, and ultimately the bottom line as well.  Put another server on and kitchen will cope.  Get your head out of your ass, who ever owns this place. If you are reading only the POS system telling you you  only need certain number of servers for certain shifts it's because you were never running at your potential in the first place.  Get your shit in order you are not new anymore and there may be less people sitting around looking at empty tables in the future if don't turn this around, idiot."}
{"text":"There are very few chances in your life to experience quality dishes prepared quickly. I ordered the Meat Lovers Specialist during happy hour and it was simply delicious. I look forward going back another day!"}
{"text":"Well this place is great. We came with my Mother in Law who is not accustomed to Japanese BBQ Yakiniku. She asked for chopsticks, \" but the kind with a rubber band around them, because I cannot use chopsticks\". We got her a fork. The Server was very nice and patient with her. Explained everything and did NOT do that thing where you make fun of someone in another language but they know your talking about them. ;)  We ordered two of the combinations and it said it served 4 people. it was enough for 6. Next time we will just get 1 combination. They were Pork, Chicken and Beef. All the meat was fresh and nicely marinaded. The Kimchi is really good, best spicy fish cakes and seaweed salad I have had since I left the west coast. A nice environment for a gathering of family and close friends you don't mind eating after LOL. We will be back to try seafood."}
{"text":"No fillers, all killers! Fast, excellent service.

We reserved ahead.

This was no-nonsense good/great eats at a reasonable price. We 3 (1 small, 2 big people) ordered the 2-person prime meat combo, with a bunch of extra à la carte items to eat/cook: bibimbap stone bowl, beers, chilli dumplings, garlic shrimps etc.

The prime meat selections tasted fresh and juicy. Our favourite was the New York steak.

We inhaled everything way ahead of the 2 hour seating limit. It was enough to be full, but not disgustingly so. About $165 with tax and tip."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. The staff has great energy and our server was awesome. I like the variety of items on the menu. I like the many different ways to order. I like their app and rewards program. I really like their lunch and happy hour specials. 

We went twice last week, once for dinner and a couple days later for lunch. For our first visit we did the all-you-can-eat menu (the most expensive one) which was great. My favorite thing about the AYCE menu is that the desserts are also AYCE. Yup, all you can eat macaron ice cream sandwiches. When we returned for lunch we each ordered a 3-4 item lunch. It was 1/3 the price of dinner but we ate the same amount of food. If you can really throw down, go for the ultimate AYCE. Otherwise, you might be better off going smaller. 

My faves: bone-in kalbi, harami miso skirt steak 
Hubby's faves: spicy yaki shabu beef, premium ny steak

I'll def be back for lunch. You can't beat the value of their lunch specials!"}
{"text":"i love their meat lovers ! dipping sauce is so delicious too! they have diffrent types of beef & seafood to cook on hibachi grill ! great for group & family & couple!"}
{"text":"Happy hour menu is a great deal. I love their beef toro, pork toro as well as kalbi shortrib.
Meat quality is general above average. But sometimes there are hit and miss . I went in today with a group of 4 people and we found out the quality of the meet is not as good as before. This is the main reason I gave 3 stars. 

Dinner menu is quite expensive in general if you want to have a big meal. 
They offer great selection of drinks and sake cocktails tastes really good. 
Dessert is a must-try."}
{"text":"I've known about this place for a while. A relative swears by it. I finally went and was not disappointed. From the filet steak to the beef ribs everything was succulent. The rice was excellent. The portion size could be more for the money. So go at happy hour, to get happy hour prices."}
{"text":"I went here last minute because Caesar's palace buffet was 2+ hour wait so that gmfu.  And then this place popped up that was open late and I'm very glad that my family and I made a choice to eat here. If you're a real one like me, you'd also choose the premium AYCE. Which comes with a better selection. Starting off the dumplings with chili oil and the karaage were an instant banger. We then kept ordering beef after beef and was highly impressed with the quality of the food. Already I was leaning towards Japanese bbq than Korean.  I really hope someday we can have one of these back in AZ.  Definitely recommend this place if you're tired of Korean bbq (like me).

{"text":"The Skinny: the grilled meats are good quality but the side dishes are not that impressive (3) service: good and efficient. Not smoky/smelly for a yakiniku place - no changing table in the restroom.(4) value: recommend coming in for lunch on Wednesday (all day happy hour) as the lunch combinations are the things to get. 10% locals discount can be used with coupons offered through their app. (3.5 starred review)

Since Opentable.com now only offers rewards at limited restaurants in Vegas, we are more likely to hit this place more often (can be redeemed here and Buca Di beppo....I frankly prefer here).

Lunch is way better pricing than dinner so we hit them up for their lunch sets. I usually get their Meat lover's set for $10.95 which comes with 4 types of meat at 2oz each, a small salad, gyoza, soup and rice. It's a good portion of food and quite filling. They also have a create your own options are well at $9.95 for 2 BBQ items and $12.95 for 3 items which comes with soup, salad and rice. They also have non-grilled lunch sets like to the hamburger steak or bibimbap bowl for less than $13.

The meats are the highlights here.  The quality here is pretty good.The marinated meats are slightly on the sweeter side and very tender. Cooking over the grill is nice due to the great ventilation system (i.e. not smelly or too smokey). 

The miso soup is pretty standard. The salad is largely made of daikon and kind of heavy on the mayo. Gyoza also ho-hum and I probably would not order it unless it was in a set.

For dessert, they have Lady M green tea crepe cake brought in... probably from LA. Ours was served with ice cream even though the signs in the restaurant says that it doesn't. (Maybe it's just me but I don't know what all the fuss is about.) They also have macaroon ice cream sandwiches from Brick (it's an LA thing) which I haven't tried but am pretty intrigued.

Service is good and fast generally. Ambience is modern with loud dance music playing. As for bringing kids here, I guess kids and grills don't mix well - hence the lack of changing tables in the bathroom. Just saying.

The value here is when you apply the discounts here on top of coming in for lunch. Locals get 10% off, dinner sets for 2 are 20% off on Saturday and Sunday. Get their app for additional coupons towards dining. Add in the Open table rewards factor this joint is a place I see myself coming back to. 3.5 starred review."}
{"text":"Almost everything ordered was delicious!  Didn't really care for the garlic noodles as it seemed to not mesh well with the other foods.  They were still pretty tasty but I don't think I'd order them again.  The staff was very friendly, attentive, and even gave tips on how to best cook the different foods.  Loved the decor (inside as well as the entrance) and the restaurant itself was well lit.  The exhaust fans did a great job at keeping the restaurant from being smoky.  I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"JJ is such a great manager. After returning my gyu kaku salad for having a LIVE LADYBUG drowned in the dressing, she made sure to come over and ask how we're doing. Completely disgusting!"}
{"text":"YOSHI was very attentive, environment was very upscale, and the selection of meats were my favorite. I loved the idea of grilling vegetables in foil,KBBQ is only side dishes so I loved the garlic spinach and broccoli. BEEF TONGUE is worth it, with the lemon squeeze... DONT FORGET TO SQUEEZE THE LEMON ON IT! :) 

Only thing I would change would be the pricing.. little pricey to access the whole menu for a dinner for 2 for $114 before gratuity."}
{"text":"I've been going to Gyu Kaku all over the usa for years and absolutely love this Vegas location. Ryan was our server tonight and did an amazing job tonight. He made sure the food was right, the drinks were filled and most of all made us all laugh. Great service tonight. Have been here several times and will continue coming back."}
{"text":"This place is impressive. The decoration is so japanese, its cool. The service was great, the server was nice, very attentive to us. , her name is Soo. The food is great. The meat was tender and juicy. We had the Haramishi meat, spicy pork, asparagus, another meat that i cant remember. We had the dessert which was so good but different. The ice cream tastes fresh and creamy. It was happy hour so the bill was just right. They have set of meals for 2 to 4 people. We did ala carte.
Next time we will get the set."}
{"text":"Loved the food here! Our server was very knowledgeable about their menu items and made some really great suggestions on their most popular dishes/appetizers. I am a server myself, so when it comes to customer service, i get really knitpicky. I forgot the name of our server, but he did a phenomenal job making sure everything was ok, everything was out in time and was also very attentive :) i would definitely recomend dining here."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Japanese/Korean bbq so decided to try this place. Ordered the Premium Meat Lover set. When the dishes came, I thought the portion would not fill me up but that's not the case. At the end, I had to walk around to digest. 
All the dishes are so fresh and good. I like how they gave you 6 different types of premium meat to try. 
The only drawback was the price, it could be all you can eat at another place but again, the meat they offer is different."}
{"text":"The bbq here is good, but not great. We got the two persons dinner special which included salad, seveal plates of meat, corn, among other things. For a bbq, and a Japanesr one nonetheless, the main emphasis should be on the quality of the meat. Based on the high price point and relatively small portions of meat, we expected the quality to be high. Unfortuneately, the meat was just okay, and did not differ from most non-Japanese bbq places. What did stand out was the corn. If they ever wanted to do a spin-off, they should definitely open a bbq corn joint."}
{"text":"The food is always great here! Lots of items to choose from. Service is always on point! Ryan is the best!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday; definitely need to make a reservation in advance or expect to wait. Food and service was great! Would come back."}
{"text":"I have been there so many times. The food quality is getting worse and the price is getting more expensive. 

Their happy hour is a good deal you can have a large beer for 5 bucks. My favorite was beef tone. It taste so juicy and fresh with lemon. We like the spicy beef bimbimbump but I think it is too spicy for us. 

Come here either in happy hour or coupon. Also their fish poke is very fishy."}
{"text":"We went there last week during their soft opening! First of all, the food-- Food was great, fresh, tasty and reasonably priced. We had the meat lover combo for two, which costed around 60 buck after 20% discount, and we were really full after the meal. Dishes came in a little bit slow. However I have to comment on the service. We waited for two hours to get a seat. As I observed when waiting, I noticed that they could have really speed up the service through a better task delegation. I understand that they were in soft opening and some of the staff are new and inexperienced. I will definitely go to their again when the the waiting line is shorter."}
{"text":"Pros:
- Got dinner for two, everything was amazing! 
- Love the atmosphere
- they fit us in without a reservation 
- super friendly staff
- neat social setting! Experience was cool!

Cons:
- our grill shut off right as soon as we got our meal took a bit for the waitress to come back 
- dropped chop sticks again it had taken the waitress a bit to get to our table
- gave each person tongs, but each dish didn't have its own tongs... Kinda worried me when picking up raw chicken then having to pick up the cooked meat...
 
Things to consider:
- We had tried to make a reservation through \"open table\" but it never went through just in case your going to use it for this gem! 
- Time! If you don't have a couple hours this may not be the place for you
- might not be child 0-5 appropriate"}
{"text":"J'y étais ce midi et c'était absolument génial! 
L'accueil et le service sont remarquables. On nous propose le remplissage de thé ou d'eau régulièrement. On vous change la plaque lorsqu'elle est trop sale sans même qu'on le demande. Du jamais vu! Je suggère cependant d'attendre un peu avant de recommencer à griller pour que la nouvelle plaque soit bien chaude. Aussi j'ai beaucoup apprécié qu'on me donne des indications sur le temps de cuisson des viandes. 
J'ai adoré l'ambiance, le décor et évidemment les plats. Le karaage (poulet frit) était tendre et croustillant à souhait. La saveur et la texture du takoyaki est bonne mais il n'y a pas assez de pieuvre. 
Les portions sont bonnes et la qualité de la viande exceptionnelle. Je vous recommande la poitrine de porc, l'onglet de buf et le kalbi. Il faut aussi goûter les papillotes de brocolis ou épinards. Ils ont une sauce secrète qui confère une saveur unique aux légumes. Les meilleurs que j'ai mangé!
J'ai déjà hâte d'y retourner..."}
{"text":"Gyu-Kaku, a Japanese BBQ chain restaurant that provides decent value for various cuts of beef.  We ordered the Happy Hour $55 combo which is meant for 2 people, but can comfortably feed 2 adults and two young kids.  We also ordered a few other items such as the beef tongue and spicy pork. The filet mignon that came with the combo was marinated well and very flavourful and tender.   The best time to come is during their super happy hour, which offers additional discount on a few popular food menu items and $3 Sapporo mugs, $5 Asahi and $4 sake cocktails.  Overall, we a had an enjoyable early dinner and left happy and full bellies."}
{"text":"I wish this place was any bit good but the meats are disappointing.  They were sinewy and tough as offered in the AYCE.  It does not encourage me to come back here. The sides were overlooked and greasy.  Seriously why would I sign up for your packages?  Please spend your hard-earned money elsewhere"}
{"text":"Went for the AYCD ... all you can drink special! $15 bucks for Sapporo and Sake, $18 for premium wells 4/5

Their happy hour starts at 9p and is all day till 6p. I had the spicy miso wings which were $5 bucks for 4 wings... FOUR wings?... wth!!! Well my friend told me there is better items on the menu so who knows I might have to redo my review. 2/5 

Service was great our bartender Roma was attentive and nice! 5/5

Also if you are looking for craft beer.. the choices are very very slim here.

AYCD is worth it for sure!"}
{"text":"This is a delicious place to eat.  And you control the cooking!

You can either order al-la-carte or you can order these special bundles at reduced prices!  The cool part about the bundles are that most of them are arranged in courses.  You'll have an appetizer, meal, and dessert!  For four people, we ordered two of Meat Lover's option and our appetites were deliciously satisfied.

Come to Gyu-Kaku for a one-of-a-kind food experience with high quality ingredients, friendly service, and trendy environment."}
{"text":"Went here with a party of 6 and we were able to make reservations.  We sat in a combo booth table with two chairs in a corner with one griller. If you like to cook your own food, then this is a place you will like. They tell you how many minutes each requires if you were unsure of how to cook.  We started with some fried potstickers and ahi tuna poke, which were both pretty good.  We order the lots of beef and pork belly.  We cooked our seafood at the end, which were scallops and garlic shrimp.  Also, ordered miso ramen and it was pretty good.  My favorite was the sukiyaki bibimbap in a hot stone bowl.  That was super yummy.  It ended up costing us about $30 a person with all the food we ordered.  The only thing that I was suprised with is that they did an automatic 18% gratuity on our bill and also taxed the gratuity.  I just thought it was odd.  Funny thing is that they have local branches here in the IE and I only heard about it when I went to visit a friend in Vegas. They also offer the macaron ice cream sandwiches for desert."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing we went here just by seeing the sign and boy this place is the food is so fresh and with the wait of seeing your food actually cook in fort of you I'm definitely coming back asap... And it came with old fashion smores you cook yourself   too.....me and wife were very please and the service phenomenal excellent they seem native or been here for many years"}
{"text":"Line up is quite long. We were a group of 6 and we tried essentially the whole menu. The various cuts of beef were quite satisfying however it could not compare to the gyukaku we had in Japan. Horoman was tasty, but most cuts were so drenched in sauces that  it burns quite easily on the grill. I rate the experience as average, maybe the lunch would have been a better vang for the money."}
{"text":"After eating at Gyu-Kaku, I would've given my review a 4. However, our server Steven was incredible and made the review completely worthy of a 5.

Came here with my parents to enjoy a Christmas Eve dinner. Upon walking in, I first took note of the beautiful exterior. Walking in, the same enjoyable look followed inside. There were partitions between areas of the room and tables, making each party's experience more private.

Between us three, we picked the Meat Lover's combo that is meant for two people and a few side dishes of vegetables. It was totally enough for all of us, so I'd suggest doing something like this unless you're super hungry. It comes with miso soup, salad, an fried bread/cheese appetizer, fried chicken, and a handful of meats to cook on the grill. I didn't really care for the fried chicken or fried bread, but otherwise the grilled meats were all solid. My parents also both got beers because there was a deal where each beer (Sapporo) was $1.50. We were stunned!! Such a great price.

Service was just wonderful. Steven was an awesome server and exactly how I wish all my servers would be like. He was friendly and approachable, without ever seeming fake. He was always attentive, but didn't ever checking in too often which can also be annoying. Refilled our drinks without us ever having to ask. I've been a server in the past, so I guess I expect a lot, but Steven was just a natural. Seriously made our experience all the better. If you read this, thanks Steven!!! We're definitely going to ask for you next time we come.

All in all, Gyu-Kaku was rad. I think the pre-decided combinations are the most worth it, but a la carte is just as good too if you're picky and know exactly what you want. Definitely make a reservation as this place can get busy. But most of all, enjoy!"}
{"text":"Imitation Japanese, there are so many better options within a few blocks. Avoid this at all costs. The service is bad too."}
{"text":"It was our first time at this restaurant tonight. My husband and I were very pleased with the service, food and the ambiance. We got the meat lovers and a side of garlic mushrooms, and we left satisfied and full. Our server (I didn't hear her name) was very friendly and helpful with explaining the menu, since it was our first time here. I think this place is good for date nights and lunch/dinner with family. I'm taking one star out because the music was a little too loud, and a lot of their sauces had MSG- which isn't a biggie, but we do try to avoid it as much as we can. It was also really cold in there. Maybe they keep the temperature low because of the BBQ grills? 

We would definitely go back to try their other items on the menu. Hopefully, the music won't be as loud next time."}
{"text":"First timer! loved the place, people and food! Had a great birthday dinner! Will be back for sure again :)"}
{"text":"My Top 3 Favorites (from the meat selection):
1) Bistro Hanger Steak with miso
2) Beef Toro (requested miso)
3) Filet Mignon

It is hard to compete with $10 AYCE Korean BBQ, but for the most part, Gyu-Kaku offers some solid lunch specials & other deals that allow you to enjoy the finer points of Asian BBQ without spending a ridiculous amount of money. On weekdays, you can order 2 BBQ meats for $9.95, and it comes with miso soup, salad, and rice. Not bad! Also, the staff will give you tips on how to cook your meat and ensure you enjoy your food. Definitely a great spot to bring anyone - coworkers, family, or friends!"}
{"text":"Best Japanese bbq i've ever tried! The food was great, waiting time is not too long, place was cozy. Unfortunately, we didn't like the service because some of the servers were ignoring us. We couldn't find our server so we had to ask like 3 other servers to grab our drink and order our dessert but it's either they pretended that they didn't see us or look away."}
{"text":"Food= clean, tastes good but portions are bit small (really Jap style) 
I went to Gyu-Kaku in NYC and Las Vegas but feels like MTL gives a bit smaller portion. I went with my fiance and ordered the happy hour menu $55 with fried chicken $6. Price is good but we went as lunch so it is bit on pricey side for lunch. If we went for dinner... we would have to take a lot more of meat. Overall, the workers are nice and the place is clean. The worker come around and check your grill and replace when needed (which this is good! some places you have to beg for replacement bc they so lazy) On top, the taste of meat tastes good."}
{"text":"Really good! 
Went with a group of friends and selected the group
menu for a party of 4 and I must say well worth the price.  The different cuts/parts of the meat were fresh and tender. The only thing I dislike was the seats are really tight especially during the winter season we have heavy coats and it takes up a lot space."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service! Server accidentally refilled ice water into my girlfriends cup (we didnt mind so we didnt say anything). But she realized and replaced the water for us immediately after :) Thoroughly enjoyed the entire BBQ."}
{"text":"I understand the Yakiniku experience is heavily Korean influenced, but I wouldn't really be able to distinguish this from any other typical KBBQ.

I was really hoping that Toronto was getting a unique Japanese BBQ experience that I've had like in New York and San Fran.

All in all, service was ok.  Meat was decent.  Nothing really stands out, but a nice to have in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"If you like bbq and you wanna try something other than korean bbq you should give Gyu kaku a try! The restaurant is spacious, however, often crowded, so I suggest you to reserve in advance!

I principally tried their beef and all I can say is that it is tasty and fresh! The \"spicy\" sauce that they have on the side is also very good! 

If youre two, the meet lover combo is a really good choice! You get to try different types of beef and a dish of chicken and it also comes with salads and a bowl of rice! And theres also combos for 4 or 6 people.

It could be a but expensive for people who eats a lot, but if you download their application you can accumulate points and exchange them towards some dishes or a cash credit! Sometimes they even have some promotions! 

Must not forget their daily specials and happy hours!"}
{"text":"The food is good, delicious but a little bit expensive, 5people= $200. One star lost because when we called the restaurant to ask for reservation, they said they don't provide this service, customers need to walk in, but when we arrived in the same day, they said they accept reservation and the policy just changed a couple days ago. Why they gave us two different answers , who lied? 

If you are interested in this restaurant, you must have reservation, because if you walk in, you have to wait for at least one hour."}
{"text":"Came by with hubby and was surprised by the ambience. Super chill and great staff. We got one of the grilling combo. One of the side meat was wagyu beef. Very small quantity but it was good! It also had side dishes etc so we were semi full at why end. Decent price range and would love to come by next time we visit!"}
{"text":"The \"Premium Meat Lover's for 2\" BBQ course included:  Starters -- Gyu-Kaku Salad, Chicken Karaage, 2 Miso Soup, Beef Sukiyaki Bibimbap; BBQ items -- Harami Miso Skirt Steak, Kalbi Short Rib, Filet Mignon, Toro Beef, New York Steak, Chicken, Corn, Broccoli; and Dessert -- Maple Syrup Gyu-Kaku Ice Cream.  It had a value of $91.50 but their regular price was $75.  I thought this was an amazing deal for the quality and quantity of food for two people!

The Miso Soup was really good!  It was a big deep bowl of miso soup with small cubed tofu; the soup wasn't too salty or thin.

The Chicken Karaage came with spicy mayo and a slice of lemon.  It was good chicken karaage too; it was slightly salty and seasoned well.  The shapes of the chicken karaage pieces were interesting though lol.

The Edamame was good.  The Kim-Chee was also really good.  Apparently, Gyu-Kaku manufactures and purveys its own brand of kimchi in Japanese supermarkets.  The kimchi wasn't too spicy either.

The Gyu-Kaku Salad had a mixture of cabbage, lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, sliced egg, and peppers.  It was a very refreshing salad and the dressing was very good too.

We started grilling the meats by this point.  (By the way, I LOVED their barbecue tongs!  How is it that something so simple as metal tongs could give me so much satisfaction and contentment?)

I was so impressed with the meats!!  The Kalbi Short Rib was really tender and marinated so well that the flavours shone brightly.  The Filet Mignon was incredibly tender.  The Toro Beef was more firm but still you could taste the quality beef in each bite like the other two meats.  I was so impressed! 

The Scallops were very squishy and chewy and fresh.

When the Corn and Broccoli were done, these were delicious too.  The Corn was buttered -- mmm, so good.  The Broccoli had sopped up a bit of the barbecue meats flavours and were cooked really well.

We took our time enjoying the food and meanwhile, the servers came by constantly to change the grills for us.  The process of changing the grills was so much more simpler than the Korean barbecue kinds -- at least to me, it looked very simple and was faster.  It helped a lot to have a clean grill to cook our meats so that we wouldn't have any extra char on our food from the previous grilling.  I really liked their attentiveness and service.

After our first round of meat, we tried the other items on our table too.  The Beef Sukiyaki Bibimbap was brought to our table with ingredients fully intact in the hot stone bowl.  This was also a really good dish!  So tasty and the beef was thoroughly marinated in the sukiyaki sauce.  Some people might found the flavour a little overpowering.

I'm so glad I ordered the Spicy Tuna Volcano to try.  This was spicy tuna on top of a inari sushi (sushi rice wrapped inside a seasoned deep-fried tofu).  By this point, I was getting full but this was definitely a must-try item on the menu because it was so good.

I'm also glad we ordered the Yuzu Shishito Pepper to try.  These peppers were grilled so perfectly, weren't spicy at all, and a great complement to the meats.

The Harami Miso Skirt Steak was the #1 bestseller on their list and I absolutely agreed with this!  Even though I didn't get to try all the meats on their menu, this was definitely the best one we tried that night.  The Harami Miso Skirt Steak was so, so juicy and tender and fantastic!  It was entirely due to the quality of the cut of meat.  I highly recommend this one!  The New York Steak was still good but when compared to the Harami, it just couldn't compare.  The Chicken was marinated with yuzu, basil, and spicy miso.  This was also good chicken that was tender after being grilled.  The main stars of that night though were the different cuts of beef. 

We finished off with a sweet note.  The Maple Syrup Gyu-Kaku Ice Cream was vanilla ice cream dusted with soybean powder with maple syrup.  It was a really sweet scoop of cold ice cream that sealed off the night of meaty goodness. 

I was very impressed with Gyu-Kaku and understand why they have expanded to so many locations all around the world. They have 600 locations globally!  I thought that their prices were very reasonable too -- especially the BBQ course for two.  Spending about $100 for good quality Japanese meat is so worth it.  I'd much rather come here for good quality BBQ than to an all-you-can-eat BBQ restaurant.  They also have Happy Hour where the deals are even sweeter.  I recommend you to try Gyu-Kaku if you haven't tried it before.  Make sure to make a reservation!  When we left at 8:15 p.m.-ish, there were so many people waiting for a table."}
{"text":"The management here is kind of an issue here. Come here for lunch quite often. The person behind the front desk seems always too busy to lead customers to the seat, even the restaurant is not half full. Service is kinda slow too."}
{"text":"This is one chain I like very much.  Whether in Chicago, San Diego, or Las Vegas, the taste is amazing and very consistent across the U.S.  Instead of Korean BBQ, our group opted for this because the rest had never had Japanese BBQ.  I was nervous that they would compare it to Korean BBQ too much and not like it, but the majority loved it just as much as Korean.  We agreed that Gyu Kaku is much better for marinated meats.  They have a huge variety of marinated meats and each one taste amazing.  The flavors are strong but surprisingly not too salty.  We got one of the combos for two people and liked everything except the chicken.  We also upgraded to the hot stone bowl beef rice instead of white rice and it was amazing and perfect for my toddler.  It also included ingredients for you to toast your own s'mores for dessert.  Just yum!  We also ordered the Lady M green tea Mille crepe cake and it was heavenly.  I don't usually like green tea anything but this was a fine exception!  The cold cream between the abundant layers of soft crepe was to die for.  No Gyu Kaku where I live so I look forward to the next city that has it!"}
{"text":"Guys, I highly recommend this place!  The atmosphere is so relaxing.  The servers are attentive AND the food is delish!  The duck, chicken basil and garlic rice are at the top of my list.  Come here for Happy Hour (Monday 5-6), you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"After being coerced by my friend to try this establishment for months, we finally gave it a try after a trip to Teddy Story.  It was around 6:30pm and Gyu-Kaku was already packed with diners!  I tried going here during a long weekend once and it was impossible to eat in unless you had a reservation. Keep that in mind if you're a fan of this place and want to use it for future celebrations.  

Fortunately, we didn't have to wait long that night and our party of five was seated at a large table with one grill and  a decent amount of arm and leg space.  The one thing that really grinded my gears about their seating arrangement though was that they seat large parties of five or more with one grill. At other grill restaurants, you'll usually find two to three people sharing a grill, thereby allowing all parties to regularly have cooked meat available to them. Since the people to grill ratio was very unbalanced here, we had to take turns receiving cooked meat as the single grill could only cook so much meat at a time.  If you come here, I would recommend going with a small party of four or less or have a flexible schedule so that no one minds spending an excessive amount of time waiting for food to be served. 

With regards to our food, we opted for the set for six people after going through all the options with the server. They are great with recommendations, so hit them up when you're uncertain of what to get. Be warned though: a set of six isn't that filling; for our party of five we were only about 3/4 full.  Our set came with a variety of meats and appetizers.  The gyozas were decent. They had a thicker shell than what I prefer, but the meat inside was good.  The bibimbap, albeit being  advertised as one of the best appetizers, tasted like rice and oil alone - a pretty unappetizing combination in my opinion. The bowl of rice they give you along with the bibimbap to enjoy with your meat was insanely dry and hard. You could tell that they make large batches of rice and leave it aside until they run out for the night.  Plus, if you look at the set closely, you'll notice that they give you two types of rice dishes per person and only a handful of meat once the meat has been divided among six people. Specifically, there are 12 pieces of meat per tray, so in a party of 6, you're looking at 2 pieces of each type of meat per diner. This leads me to conclude that the patron is left to fill up on rice to compensate for the lack of meat so that they don't walk out hungry. It is cost effective for the business, but I think it's a blow to the customer's experience because the priority at a grill restaurant is to enjoy the meat.  

Despite being small in portion size per person, the quality of the meat was great.  My bf and I have had better pork at Korean BBQ houses, like Huh Ga Ne (not the ayce kind), but we thoroughly enjoyed the bistro hanger steak and toro beef here. Still, at the end of the day, when you're paying $30+ per person after splitting the bill for a set, I don't think Gyu-Kaku leaves a positive impression and it doesn't effectively bait you for a future visit."}
{"text":"Ordered the samurai for four people and it was so.much.food.  We were all so stuffed... the meats just kept on coming!  Overall, it was a very good and fun meal.  The restaurant was nice and our server was wonderful.  Though the meat could have been seasoned a bit better, it was still excellent.  Definitely go early and make a reservation-- at 6:00 PM, it was quiet and relaxing.  By 8:30 PM, it sounded like a nightclub."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Happy hour all day Wednesday. The New York and their chicken is amazing. Garlic rice is garlicky goodness. I also like their steamed chili dumplings. Good food for a good price!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. It reminds me of Gangnam bbq. Very similar. They have sets with different meats and appetizers. We ordered the premium happy hour course. There were 4 of us so we ordered a few a la carte items that were not part of the course meal including the bistro hanger steak, yaki-shabu beef, toro beef, and New York steak. All the meat tasted so good. We especially liked the harami miso skirt steak which came with the course so we ordered it again. It was very tender and full of so much flavor. The appetizers were just okay, not good or bad. We would probably just order the meats separately without the appetizers. The dessert s'mores were pretty good. Also, they had 3 different sauces for your meat: ponzu, sweet soy, and spicy. They were all good. The service was really good. Overall, 5/5 for food minus the appetizers, 5/5 for service.

Also, we found out recently that they now have all you can eat bbq. We're definitely going to try it next time."}
{"text":"Second experience at Gyu-Kaku, and it was amazing! We were a party of 6 and everything was top notch. The restaurant was full, and our server Agi was very attentive and very helpful. Loved this experience.. amazing food, great laughs with great friends!!"}
{"text":"I come across this restaurant when I was driving around. I took my husband to try it out.. We got the meat lover and the portion is really good enough for 2 persons which is good..The price is decent for what your getting, this place is a MUST to try!"}
{"text":"Gyu-Kaku is a Japanese BBQ chain. It is a fun \"grill-it-yourself\" restaurant. The tables are equipped with grills and you can grill the meats and vegetables at your table. Service was efficient.

The menu is predominantly a la carte - tapas restaurants. There are also a variety of pre-set BBQ courses that provide a much better value - which I would recommend.  The meats in the pre-set courses are marinated well. The highlight is the perfectly marbled Kobe Style Rib Eye Steak. It was tender and flavourful.  For dessert, we had smores. It's a nostalgic way to end a fun meal.

I would recommend this place if you enjoy a lively \"do-it-yourself\" Japanese BBQ restaurant. Definitely not the place for vegetarians. Pro tip: The restaurant may get hot due to the grills. You may also end up smelling like BBQ. Dress appropriately."}
{"text":"Definitely worth it ! My boyfriend and I took the meat lover's & thought all the meat tasted sooo juicy, tender and flavorous I fell in love all over again every time i took bites. 
Their service was amazing, people there were so nice & gentle !! They change the grill if they see that it has to be changed, no need to ask unlike other BBQ places :)
When i saw the $$$ on their menu, i was shooketh.. But after spending my time there, it's very reasonable. I'll definitely be coming back to try other things in the menu!!"}
{"text":"Some comments say it's similar to chako actually not at all. Meat is so much better than other places."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but I just couldn't get over my first experience here. My boyfriend and I are kbbq regulars so we thought we'd try something different this time. We had really high hopes for this place considering the yummy looking pictures of meat and appetizers here on Yelp. We tried all the highly recommended items and a few different ones like the liver and duck breast. Unfortunately we were let down bc even though the meats claimed to have different marinades, they all tasted the same.. some even had no taste at all. Thankfully they do have 3 different types of sauces, but we'd rather not mask our meats with tons of sauce to begin with.

I spent $80 for half the amount of meat i would get at an ayce BBQ place. This place is \"alright\", not a place I would come to regularly. Kbbq all the wayyyy"}
{"text":"Really wanted to eat here, but we were never acknowledged by the bartender or the waiter (there were no hosts) even though the bartender saw us and only 2 tables had customers. Someone could've said they'd be with us soon but no one did so after a long wait we decided to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"First visit here since moving from Oahu. The bf and I loved the Gyu-kaku back home so we decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, I'm really disappointed with the overall service, food presentation, and quality. Throughout the entire dinner service, we were only checked up on 3x and waited 15-20 min to put in our order. Sad to say, but I'd dine elsewhere considering the wide array of restaurants near the area."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch and had the Meat Lover's ;)   Japanese BBQ lunch special. 
The meat was so delicious and so well marinated. 
The New York Strip steak was so fresh and juicy. Great selection of drink, Will try next time for sure."}
{"text":"No joke this place will mess you up...psychologically.  It's like the movie Inception but in your mouth!

All in all amazing place, great atmosphere,  amazing food!"}
{"text":"This place was on my list to visit and finally we were able to try out gyu-kaku last weekend. We arrived around 5pm and was worried we might have to wait a while because we didn't make reservations. But we ended up waiting for a few minutes, and was seated quickly by the back. We had no idea what to order so we chose one of the set meals - Meat Lover $55?. Meat Lover came with 6 dishes of different cuts of meat (sorry don't remember what they were), a plate of salad, karaage, buttered corn AND ice cream at the end. The food was really good and I did not find it salty like what one reviewer had said.

Anyway, let me tell you this was a lot for two people! We were so full towards the end that I couldn't look at food anymore. What I liked about this place was that the servers would change our grill from time to time, and one server even refilled our pop without us even asking. If you sign up for their newsletter you get $10 off when you spend $30+.

Can't wait to come back and try their other items!"}
{"text":"Today I tried this restaurant for the first time . There was no waitbto be seated, and our waitress was prompt and polite. The group that I was with decided to get one combo with a few added sides which turned out to be enough for 3 people to eat and still have left overs. The meal comes with soup , salad, appetizers, a selection of meats , rice dishes and even a cute desert of smores to top off the experience. I loved the food and I do plan on returning."}
{"text":"Food was great, very fresh! Price is good we had the combo meal for two $88 it was plenty of food for our six year old too. Service was good, but could be a little faster. It comes with dessert and the kids Loved it, you can roast marshmallows for snores. Definitely will go back"}
{"text":"The quality of some meats are really good. We went for a la cart rather than having a combo as what we really wanted to get wasn't all part of the combo. The more expensive beef tongue was heavenly tasty! However some of the marinated dishes (such as enoki mushroom) were a bit too salty for my liking. One big down side was the air con wasn't working well in summer, making the whole dinner experience very hot and steamy as you could imagine. Restaurant owner, please fix your air con before summer comes again!!! But will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Ok, so the good...the bad...and the ugly.

Service was great! Then again I came right when they opened which was a Sunday at 11:30AM, so it wasn't a peak rush time. The waitress was very informative, very attentive, and was friendly. My boyfriend and I decided to pick the set meals because it just seemed like the best bang for your buck. 

We ordered the premium meat lover's set which had 5-6 different meat dishes including filet mignon, skirt steak, kalbi ribs (the best cut and most flavorful of the bunch) etc. There were sides like kaarage, corn, enoki mushrooms, miso, and salad. Honestly the meat was really tasty, especially the marinade. The grill had grids which meant to me, the meat would be evenly cooked. Also, the waitress changed the grill 1-2x which in comparison to Korean Grill House, is non existent. That tells me the grill is greased often and cleaner. I loved the corn with the butter and especially enjoyed the kalbi short ribs. The waitress had told us it's the number one seller along with 2 other meat choices that are top sellers as well. I have to agree, it was so melt in your mouth kind of wonderful.

Now the bad and the ugly. So the meat, we were told, was to cook x amount of times. For example the ribs would be 2-3 minutes, the skirt steak 3-4 or whatever the type of cut was had different cooking times. I don't think the meat was cooked well enough or the marinade did not sit with me because I got food poisoning within a couple hours of eating it. I threw up practically 80% of the meat I ate.  So either:

a) I didn't cook it long enough
b) the waitress underestimated the cooking times
c) the meat was contaminated
d) all of the above,.

Honestly, I really wanted to like this place and I am trying to give it the fairest review. Service was excellent, food was good (up until I threw it up), I loved the concept....but food poisoning just pretty much makes you NOT want to come back. 

So yes, I recommend this place but with caution. But be warned to seriously char and overcook your meat because I got very sick from not cooking it long enough."}
{"text":"Happy Hour Mon,Wed: All Day, Tue & Thur-Sun 12pm-6:30 pm & 9pm-12:30am
M-F 2PM-5PM $2, $3 & $4 specials.

I love this happy hour.  Fruity mixed drinks for $4?!?!  I'm sold.  Summer Blossom and Melon Soju Cooler are my faves.  Food is good too and inexpensive.  If you go to happy hour between 2-5pm you can combine all their specials and really get a deal.  We usually opt for one of their group courses where you get a bit of everything and add on any extras as needed.  Service is ok.  I have felt a bit rushed at times even though the restaurant was almost empty.  I'll put up with average service for $4 drinks.  

They have good lunch specials too."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

Interesting concept and it was nice that they had combo sets with different things for you to try. I tried the Happy hour combo and there was pretty good selection of meats. The quality is average but better than Ayce places. I felt that the sukiyaki bibimbap was quite flavorful but really sweet. Nothing really stood out from the meal though. It was a good place to try out but not sure if I would return as I much prefer Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"Not the best tabletop grilling style Japanese BBQ I've ever tried, (especially if you have ever had the luxury to try Anjin in Costa Mesa, CA) but there were some redeeming dishes of the evening. They also offer some decent deals during happy hour; plus they have pre fixe dinner combos that seem like they would be a good option for some: ranging from $55, $66, $77.77 and in addition to 20% off those set prices during happy hour. Happy hour is daily 5-6:30pm & 9-close.

We prefer selecting our few favorites from the menu so we went the a la carte route. Here's our favorites of the evening:

Garlic herb Filet mignon $7.95 - it was tender and grilled nicely on the tabletop grill.

Bacon asparagus $4.95 - bacon makes everything better.

Spicy pork $3.95 - classic Korean style spicy pork - mild, but cooked well on the grill and a great cheap meat dish to get your fill.

Angus ribs $4.95 - tender, juicy and seasoned well.

Miso $1.95 - traditional style, comforting, came out piping hot, and a plus it's not watered down!

Spicy tuna volcano $5.95 - it's packed up with a load of crispy fried rice, but if you eat it carefully, you can reserve some of that extra crispy rice and enjoy it with your grilled meats. I highly recommend that!

Beef tongue $7.95 - very tender and you can't go wrong! I love it.

Scallion sauce $1 - order this sauce. Order lots of it!!! The beef tongue and the rest of the grilled meats paired perfectly with this sauce.

Crunchy garlic sauce $1 - an oily bomb, but don't fret, the crispy charred garlic and spice bits are actually really tasty with the grilled meats- so scoop away!

Rice $1.95 - we really didn't need to order the rice, but one order was more than enough to share between 2 adults (just make sure you took my tip about the spicy tuna volcano's crispy rice above and you'd be set for success!) 

Pass on these:
Toro beef $3.95 - dried out, chewy 
Yakishabu $3.95 - dried out, very chewy
Corn butter $2.95 - skip! Canned corn and not special in any way
Garlic mushroom $2.95 - it was also very basic, so it's worth passing on, but if you're a mushroom lover like us, it may be worth a try 

What made this place just OK to me, was their sauces. The sauce makes or breaks Japanese BBQ and theirs were lacking authenticity. They offer 3 tabletop sauces: ponzu, sweet soy, and spicy, which are are mediocre and could use some extra love. They each tasted basic as if they were purchased bottled from the asian section at the grocery store. Leaves a lot to be desired, you feel me? Well, if I had to choose a favorite it would definitely be the spicy one. Had a nice tang and slight sweetness to it; not spicy in the slightest. 

Now that you've heard the word, get cookin', good lookin'!!"}
{"text":"I really had high expectation before I went to Gyu Kaku last night. It is a good restaurant but lower than my expectation. 

Service: 5 star
    Passionate and Kind
Starters: 5 Star
    I love the starters, especially Gyu Kaku salad and     steam dumpling
Entrees: 3.5 Star
    my boyfriend likes Kobe style beef last time he came, but I would say it was not worth the price, too chewy. The beef tongue was much better than what I had in Tucson, recommended. Teriyaki Bibimbap  was sweet and delicious. Oh, and the grilled salmon, I used to not like cooked salmon in my life, but this one really changed my taste, you have to try it. is Others are just not too good but ok. 
Dessert: 4 Star
     I am a dessert girl and my Vegas trip is just for those dessert. I have never tried the S'more and it looked delicious in photos, but for me it is too sweet, well but it's fun to grill marshmallow. Lady M is good, I tried it once before. 

Overall a 4 star, will not scheduled for my next Vegas travel but will recommend to my friend."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Japanese BBQ, so I have no prior experiences to base this off of.

Basically, you order your foods, then cook them on the grill built into the table. This is similar to the Korean BBQ places near it, and in that sense, the meat was so much better quality here. Every cut of beef, the duck breast, even the shrimp was delicious. The bibimbap was tasty, as were the rest of our food.

We opted to get the $77 course menu for two, but split it 3 ways and ordered a little extra, since their happy hour is before 6:30 or after 9:00.

The restaurant itself was nice, clean, attractive, and the noise level was great. Our waitress was very attentive, always checking on how our cooking was going or if any of us needed refills.

Will definitely be coming back to try more."}

Loved everything we had. The meats are delicious and the bibimbap was perfect.
The service was also very good."}

The also got a happy our menu and some other options, but the combo is just easier to make choices.
The beef grill is amazing, very good quality, my husband is a meat lover and he just loves it. I personally like the number3 popular beef forgot the name mignon something, very tasty! 
Well I known it's a grill restaurant, but their ice cream is sooooo good!! I had green tea ice team for dessert and my husband had black sesame, both of them are so delicious!!"}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed this restaurant and was surprised by the cleanliness/lack of smell. We were a party of 3 but we ordered the special meal for 4 people so that we could try a variety of dishes. It included a number of appetizers, as well as vegetables and raw meats to grill ourselves. Funnily enough, the stand out dishes for us were the fried chicken karaage and the garlic noodles - although I also enjoyed every other item we had. I would say that the raw items that we grilled ourselves ranged from very good to good; although we all agreed that our least favorite was the filet mignon. The service was warm and professional with the Japanese politeness and flair of calling out greetings. We're already planning another visit to try some of the items we didn't get to sample this time."}
{"text":"go during Reverse Happy Hour! I went with three friends and it was my first time ever at an Asian BBQ place. The location isn't a bad place but the inside of the restaurant was gorgeous! There is a lot of Asian flare to it and I felt like I was in another country because of it. The prices during reverse happy hour are a steal to me. I got cabbage kimchi and hanger beef with a drink for only $9. The kimchi was amazing and so was the meat! I love that you cook your own meat to your liking but it already comes seasoned. The flavor station for the meat is a great addition too! Go with the sweet sauce! I've only been here once but I can't wait to go back!"}

We got the meat lovers  sooooooo much food omg??? U get your money's worth for sure very generous with the amount of food they provide to u...

Our server was very nice a little fast talking but that's ok cuz we wanted to stuff our faces 

I honestly can't even remember all that we got because it was just so much but it was very good and happy hour u can't beat that at all

I'll totally come back"}
{"text":"Went there fore my mom's birthday on a saturday night, a group of 6 people. I would recommend making a reservation as the place was packed! 

- we got the super fan of meat group combo (made for 2 people) but twice (therefore for 4 people), and it was plenty for us! Everyone was full - meaning it is pretty generous portions. 
It includes several entrees (bibimpbap, chicken karaage, salads, a bunch of different delicious meats and ice cream)

- the ambiance is really nice, hip yet casual. I find it sweet that all of the staff greet and thanks the customers as they come in and leave. 

- Our waitress, Emilie, was really sweet and professional, she refilled our tea and soft drinks as soon as they were close to low, came to see us several times to make sure we were enjoying our time, which we were! 

- the meat is of a good quality, not like some of the AYCE korean bbq places. 

I would definitely come back and recommend this place over those AYCE korean bbq places, for about the same price, you get better quality food, which is always a win!"}
{"text":"Drool drool drooling. I absolutely love this place. I came here several times already and each time it gets better. Except for that one time I didn't have a reservation and it was packed, but never mind that. You can actually place a reservation online and it was totally hassle free. I changed the number of people so many times throughout the day and they still accommodated to it. Big plus. 

I am a HUGE meat eater. I love eating beef so this place was totally made for me. Everything we have ever ordered was all delicious. My boyfriend and I always order from their 2 for whatever meals. It is a ton of food. It's more than enough for two. It comes with an array of different appetizers and marinated meats. AND with s'mores to end the meal. Recently they started serving macaron ice cream sandwiches. Uh hello yes please! 

The only con about this place would probably be slow service sometimes. It's like why is it taking so long for raw meat to get to our table. Are they slaughtering the cow fresh to order or what? Besides that I can actually overlook that because the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of red meat, but I loved this place! We live nearby and decided to try it out on a Thursday night. I wanted to reserve on OpenTable but didn't see a convenient time so called them and they were happy to accommodate us at 7pm. The place itself is nicer than I expected (I was picturing an AYCE chain), with birch trees, brick walls and concrete floors. We wore random clothes because we expected to smell like bbq afterwards, but the ventilation system is actually so efficient that we didn't need to jump in the shower after dinner. You can order set meals for 2 or 4 people, or go a la carte. We ordered their 3 beef bestsellers, spicy pork, spicy kalbi ramen (can you see the pattern), Korean tofu soup, mushroom medley and Shishito peppers. The food was delicious! The beef cuts were premium and so tender. They give you dipping sauces for your meats but honestly everything was so well-marinated that you don't even need the sauces. Just be warned though- they do favour quality over quantity as the portions were relatively small. I also didn't care much for the ramen as their focus is obviously on the bbq. For dessert we had the red bean fish pancake. We grilled the \" fish \" and devoured it warm with scoops of sesame ice cream. What more can you ask for? We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been to the one in Hawaii 3 times and it is fantastic and so I wanted to take my son and UNLV Rebels to the one Vegas for his birthday and they gave great service and the food was good however; Hawaii was better and had more choices but if you like beef this is the place."}
{"text":"Ok so first of i gotta give it to then food is amazing but the service sucks. I waited for a kalbi for 1 hour!"}
{"text":"What an awesome Japanese BBQ spot. Happy to finally see them in Vegas. It is pricey but you definitely pay for what get for! The meats and marinades were awesome. Best best best J bbq spot in town."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this chain and this Vegas location certainly does not disappoint.

We came here for their Monday all day happy hour. One of the best happy hours all around in my opinion. Not just for alcohol, but the few dollars that you save on plates adds up in the end if you have an appetite like me.

They have 30 ounce Sapporo and Asahi drafts. Literally the mugs are as big as my head. Also other favorites like a lychee martini. This really isn't a place you come to drink like one of the local bars but the mixed drinks always hit the spot.

We started off with the cheese wontons. Always a good choice but remember to eat them fast. You don't want them sitting around too long for the cheese inside goes from gooey goodness to cardboard. 5/5

We also went with the fillet. You save about two dollars during happy hour. And the New York steak. Both extremely good quality. 5/5

We also had the sukiyaki bimbimbap (I think that's how you spell it. Comes in a large cattle looking bowl. Extremely hot so be careful. For a crispier rice, let it sit in the bowl for a while before you stir and serve. Also a 5/5.

Definitely a good place for friends and family to hang out or if you want to nuzzle up next to your sweetheart it's also a great spot."}
{"text":"I LOVE Gyu Kaku -- I've been to several locations in LA and Valencia, and I'm ecstatic that there is finally a spot in Vegas. This has to be my favorite location just because of the drink menu.  Most of the other ones have the same drink menu, which mainly consists of soju cocktails; those are good but I appreciate the variety the LV location has.  I tried three drinks, including the mint apple, one with blue curacao and lychee (delicious!) and a raspberry one (a little tart for me but still good). It's probably one of the cheapest places to drink since the cocktails are $3-$5 during happy hour. Can't beat that!  And the food, as always, was delish.  Their calamari and cheese wontons are must haves.  Can't wait to go back next."}
{"text":"This is great spot for a date or group of friends. Food is only as good as the cook so trust in yourself cause it is seasoned to be great."}
{"text":"Compared to other gyu kaku locations, this location is pretty good. Not over the top good like the ones I've been to in California, but it definitely hits the spot. Food tastes the same as the restaurants in California, and service is always good. I don't frequent this location, but when I'm in the area, I definitely stop by here. Give this place a try for some good Japanese bbq"}
{"text":"2nd time here. Good experiences both times. First time didn't get much direction about cooking, but tonight, the second time around our server (jimmy, I believe) gave cooking time instructions which we appreciated! Great food and happy hours! Spent the same amount if not less than we would have spent at an AYCE place and left absolutely stuffed."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch experience here. I'm not normally a fan of do-it-yourself bbq, but the fans work well here. No stink after. The service was lovely. Kudos to the staff. The price for lunch $13.99 (3 type of meats, rice, salad and soup) was good value. 

My tip? Go with a  group of people and just order a whole whack of meats and figure out which one is your favourite. Mine was spicy pork. Everything was good and we tried almost every single cut of meat. 

I plan to go again for dinner very soon with my husband. The whole experience was fun and pleasant."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday around 5:30pm. The after-work rush hour wasn't in full effect so there was plenty of seating complete with nice decoration and ambiance created by the restaurant. 

Ended up ordering the meat lover's special which was just the right amount of food for a satisfying meal for 2! For those similar to KBBQ, this is pretty much the same concept whereby raw meats are served, and you're given the grill at the centre of the table to cook your meats to your hearts content.

What sets this place apart from the other BBQ places I've been to is the quality of the meat. I'm a huge meat lover (wow that sounds wrong), but it was very obvious that the meat here was of much better quality than the typical BBQ place. Tables come with 3 different sauces - my favourite being the \"spicy\" one (although it's really not spicy at all). 

All in all, it was a pretty awesome place to visit and I'd go again! Price-wise it's a bit steeper than I'd like (ended up costing around $40 per person after tax and tips), but there is a happy hour if you arrive before 5pm for a few bucks off!"}
{"text":"Was told the waiting time is 30 mins. 45 mins later, I had to check with the waitress. She told me that the waiting time was another 40 mins to an hour... and the original 30 mins waiting time was just estimated and I shouldn't rely on that!!! MISS, your estimate was way too off!!! I don't like the way they value customers' time. 

I ended up leaving because I don't think it worths waiting. I had them couple times before. The food is only okay. It is just chain-store quality. Toronto deserves real and better Japanese BBQ with nicer service! 

I never leave comments, but after they wasted my time like this. I decided to give them a review."}
{"text":"As I entered Gyu-Kaku at my last visit about a month ago, I was greeted by a sign with a big fat B rating from the health department. Hopefully, they've rectified that. I've eaten at more questionable establishments before so a B rating was only enough for me to take pause. My favorite items on their menu are the duck breast and Japanese pork sausages. I'm not a huge fan of their beef items because they put some sort of sauce on them. I prefer the beef plain for grilling. I would suggest skipping the course menus and just getting exactly what you want a-la-carte. The course meals, for me, had too many items I wouldn't normally order. There's plenty of seating and the space reminds me of a mainstream yakiniku(grilled meat) restaurant in Tokyo. So far, Gyu-Kaku opens for dinner at 5pm and doesn't close it's doors til 2am. Perfect for those with intense late-night food cravings."}
{"text":"Think izakaya + korean bbq - the free side dishes and you'll get this place totally. 

The atmosphere, decor and service is of an izakaya. Very energetic and fun. The place reeks of succulent meat. Need I say more? Just go make reservations because there's a sure line up for dinner. 

Service is always good with a dilligent cute Japanese server. Even tho you might not understand them entirely but their hospitality and cuteness definitely gives them the upper hand. You can never bare a grudge at an izakaya. They also change your grill as often as needed! No ashy grill here!

Ordered the premium meat set for 2 and the portions are a good value. Lots of food and had left overs. Ofc finished the meat tho :p 

But wait. They serve KOBE beef. I didn't end up ordering it since the set was too much. But def ball hard next time."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is intimate and inviting. There is a lot of variety when it comes to the selection of food. They have prefixed menu for couples or groups, but I went for the AYCE. There are booths for couples and smaller groups, but I noticed that this is a good place for bigger groups as well.

The quality of the meat was good and had a lot of flavour. The grill had a nice ventilation system so that you're not coming out smelling like BBQ. I paired the selections of meat with a glass of Pinot Noir, and that combination went well together!

Customer service was great! Our server, Yoshi, was very attentive. Waters were refilled accordingly.

They have an app where you can scan your receipt for points which eventually lead to rewards (screenshot below). It is a little pricey, but at least the quality is better than your average BBQ place!"}
{"text":"Japanese yakiniku chain restaurant. Disappointment is the menu is way different than the ones in Japan. But it still holds its authenticity by offering different cuts of quality meats. Courses are the way to go. We got meat lovers for myself and my husband. Our son took part in it too, and we all were stuffed. S'mores for dessert seemed a little odd, but after all it made sense. There's a fire pit in front of you so why not, right? We brought some friends who were new to this concept of cooking your own food at the table thing lol but they enjoyed themselves, I think."}
{"text":"Opened for 3 months in downtown Calgary. Free parking after 6 pm & Sunday. Reservation required in advance recommended. Nice Decor, fast friendly service. All Japanese BBQ, kinda similar to Korean BBQ, no sushi or sashimi. Its interesting but nothing really surprising. Foods are good. Pretty good price $30-$50/ person. Music were a bit too loud for dinning room.
Ambient - 4
Service - 4
Foods - 4"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants. We've been here many times. Today we can early around 4pm but couldn't be seated right away even though there were empty tables. The food came quickly as usual which helps with a hungry toddler. Food is good in general. Bathroom needs to be cleaned a little more. Will be back."}
{"text":"It is really good, and especially you go during 11.30-4.00pm on weekdays. the lunch menu is a good deal! the meat is soooo goooood! i love it.  service is amazing too.  good place to go in winter."}
{"text":"The food here is delish however, they seem to be short staffed. We had lunch there yesterday. Walked in around 12:45 and didn't leave until 2:45. Took about 10 min before we got drinks...  We got our appetizers came pretty quickly however to get our meat.... It took over an hour! I was sitting behind the service center and our meat must have been sitting at the counter for a good 15 min before someone had brought it over. I think they forgot about it and us. Never got a drink refill. Not sure if I want to come back here if the service is this bad. The upside is...At least they were friendly."}
{"text":"The food was just okay, which is pretty disappointing considering the price. The staff was overbearing in their upselling of the menu and their excessive and extensive interruptions to explain of how to cook every single dish made it really hard to actually enjoy spending time with the people I came with. On the bright side, their specialty cocktails were really delicious. I'd go back for drinks at the bar. But that's all."}
{"text":"This place is the Best!!!! The food has so much flavor, the service is great and it's fun having the grill at the table to do it yourself. My favorites are the garlic noodles and Harami miso steak, it's so tender and flavorful! It's so good I could eat it everyday!"}
{"text":"Makes sure to come for happy hour. Also make sure to get the shabu beef it has a sweet flavor which I like. Try the spicy pork and like I said before make sure to come for Happy Hour"}
{"text":"Amazing! Used to be a favorite back home in California, they've perfected it here in Vegas.  The food is unique. Family friendly  environment  (the nephews  love to cook for us.) And the deals are ridiculous, there is always a special going on.
And for lunch, while all the staff is great, Yoshi is by far one of the nicest and most helpful servers in town."}
{"text":"Came to Gyu-Kaku for dinner on a busy Friday night, and I'm glad we had reservations. The wait for a table was an hour, and even I waited a tiny bit for my table, despite having a reservation.

It's brand new and novel, so it's expected.

We sat down and took a look at the huge menu; Gyu-Kaku has individual plates of pre-cooked appetizers and grill-yourself meats and vegetables.They also offer set courses meant for groups, but we found that those set courses came with a lot of stuff that we really didn't want. In addition, they have \"Happy Hour\" offerings, that is only from 11:30am to 5pm, and it isn't posted anywhere on the website or in the restaurant, and we had to ask. Their cocktail menu is also on the weak side, so I didn't bother ordering anything other than a \"mega mug\" of Sapporo.

We ordered a takowasa with seaweed to start, which seemed to lack a real wasabi punch, but it was seasoned well and was a great way to start our meal. For the grill, we ordered the Harami miso skirt steak, kalbi short rib, beef tongue, duck breast, spicy pork, spinach garlic, and corn with butter. I apologize that all of my photos are of raw meat, but... what else are you going to do?

Overall, the meat for the grill was well seasoned and tasted fresh enough, and they cooked quickly enough to be eaten quickly. The sauces on the table were great for dipping the meats into, but the best one was the one described as spicy, but wasn't very spicy at all. I also liked that the servers would suggest cooking times for each plate, but it does make dinner a bit more of a chore, since I'm the one sitting there timing out my meats and making sure they're cooked properly and not overly done. 

In addition, the vegetables came wrapped in foil, and were to just sit on the grill for a few minutes. I'm not sure if we were supposed to get instructions aside from time, or how other people really do this, but it was quite the sight of me having to pull the veggies out using my chopsticks, and then to pull open the pouches as quickly as I could, because the aluminum foil was doing its best impression of hot metal.

After all the meat and veggies, we had decided we were still on the hungry side, so we ordered a bowl of garlic noodles with beef. They came served in a hot stone bowl, and a server mixed it up for us before leaving it on the table for us to dole out. It was a decent way to fill up at the end of the meal, and something about the noodles becoming crispy thanks to the stone bowl was really tasty.

We ended the meal by ordering the fried taiyaki with ice cream, and we chose black sesame ice cream to go with our taiyaki. We had to do the grilling ourselves to warm the dessert up, which was kinda fun, but also charred the outside a tiny bit. Whether that's good or bad, I will leave up to you. The taiyaki tasted great, since I love red bean, and alongside the black sesame ice cream, was a great way of ending our meal.

As a random side note: if you aren't into loud, shouty places, you might want to avoid Gyu-Kaku. They do that thing where a staff member will call something out, and the rest of the staff shout their response in unison, which is great. However, the Gyu-Kaku staff seem to call out their responses whenever they feel like it, which ends up becoming a giant chain of yelling, disrupting whatever conversation I was just having. 

My overall experience at Gyu-Kaku was great. Our server was attentive and very friendly, even going out of his way to make sure we made more convenient choices for two and/or ordered enough food. The food tasted good, where the meat was fresh and seasoned well, but I don't think I want to cook my own food very often when I eat out.

I'll probably come back with a bigger group to try more things and do less cooking, but I had a good time at Gyu-Kaku."}
{"text":"The lunch special is worth it. I'm a chubster, used to ayce, and I went immediately after a workout and found it quite filling. $10.76 for two meats, rice, soup, and salad M-F 12-4 pre-tip, and their extended happy hour makes it so you can create your own lunch special for a little more than a $1 extra most other times. Their brisket and belly is marinated unlike other spots but it's not overwhelming."}
{"text":"Friend recommended me here. Over 400 restaurants in Japan. Amazing food. Customer service was phenomenal. Great job JJ. Made happy hour. Awesome drinks. Eat here people!"}
{"text":"The Korean BBQ offers higher quality meats in a non buffet format. The meat were well marinated and the service was good."}
{"text":"Okay so where do I start.... The manager that was at the host station was nice, she got us tables that sat across from one another since we had a party of 7, we ordered our food 5 mins earlier from when our friends arrived but go your starters since we got the \"first starter pack\". The time of us ordering was at 1:02 and we didn't recurve our raw meat until 1:50 after we had to say something to them twice before getting our food. There was a couple that received there food before us that actually got seated after us. We got our food the same time as all of our other friends, they also gave us other tables food and appetizers, everything but our raw meat. So when we finally got our food the nice waiter explained that he would take 10% off but really we need our bill 50% off because this place was just very unorganized and instead of learning how to say namaste everyone needs to remember the times in which the food was placed for order.... Just saying.
F.y.i I Heard California's location was better"}
{"text":"Not even sure how this place came onto my radar, but I am glad it did!
We went with a small gaggle of people, and it was a blast!

We ordered a bunch of the \"hot apps\" - honestly, was not that impressed with this part of the menu. Calamari was kind of blah, the salad was nothing impressive. We had high hopes for the fried bacon chips. And they were fine, not amazing. 

Do not be discouraged- This was a small speed bump in an over-all great night.
The fun really began when we started getting the food that we cook at the small gas grill in the middle of the table! The marinades are awesome, the process is perfect for interactions, conversation, and nibbling! LOVED the Pork Belly and short ribs! The Garlic shrimp was great too- Order a couple, there are only 4. We threw some asparagus and shishito peppers on, YUM!  Plus a bunch of other meats. 

This is a perfect spot for a quiet romantic dinner or a small group of friends.
A great addition to the LV!

Here is my tip-
Ask for the Happy Hour menu! It is from 6PM-10:30PM 
Same food, just a little break on the price."}
{"text":"Delicious food! All of the meats are high quality, and the appetizers are amazing. I highly recommend the short ribs, the skirt steak, and the garlic chicken noodles. 
This is definitely one of favorite places in Vegas now."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Friendly. Good attention to details. Food is delicious. The best time to go is during happy hours. Definitely worth it. They will take care of you and make sure you're enjoying your experience there, even if it's your first time."}
{"text":"Despite being a chain, Gyu-kaku is my favorite BBQ restaurant. I've been to the Vegas location and the one in Huntington Beach, Ca and the food, atmosphere and service  have all been consistently great.

Their happy hour is absolutely awesome and you can eat and drink like a king and still come out with a reasonable tab. Their meat selections are all reasonable with some off the wall stuff like intestines and liver for the more adventurous eater.

Th alcohol isn't just beer but various colorful drinks that you'd be embarrassed to be caught with. But you'll still drink them because they're that good. 

I usually just go in for happy hour and feel like this is one of the best deals around without feeling like you're eating in a barn somewhere. It's reasonably priced without sacrificing all the glam."}
{"text":"Good enough service. They take reservations. Parking lots around the place. Do-your-own-BBQ kind of a place. However, odd that they were unwilling to split the bill even from the very beginning and then wouldn't use two credit cards to split a bill (my guess is trying to save on credit card costs). I've never had a place this size refuse to split a bill or even accept 2 credit cards to split the bill. So carry extra cash around so you can pay the other party if you're going for a group dinner/lunch. 

On another note, they have happy hour specials and stuff on the food. BBQ spicy pork is nice and would recommend."}
{"text":"Although their spicy kalbi ramen & spicy tuna volcano is not that great everything on their happy hour is unbelievably amazing including drinks. Must go to!"}
{"text":"I rarely eat meat, but when I do....watch out because here I come. 
I just love the concept of cooking my own meal on the grill. Something very primal about it. And who doesn't love using tongs to grill with. 
Make sure to call ahead for a reservation, this place gets packed.
Good for sitting at the bar and watching the game, or on a romantic date for two, or with a group- although I don't like sharing so once again, what out or I may get you with the tongs. 
It can be a bit overwhelming with all the choices so come hungry and try as many as your belly will allow. 
Check our their HH specials-will make your wallet thank you."}
{"text":"Service and food was great. Servers name was Derrick and he explained the menu and cooking instructions very thoroughly. Love how everyone says goodbye to you on the way out. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I have been to Gyu Kaku numerous times before in NYC. In fact, I even had about 490 rewards points to spend in my app! The BF has never been - and has not had Japanese BBQ before. So when I discovered that there is a branch in Toronto, I offered it up as a dinner option. Honestly, we had so many options for dinner that I'm not even sure how we decided on this one! 
We had 8:30pm reservations and arrived about 5 minutes after. They seated us right away, no problem. Last call is 9:00pm, so we had to make our food decisions quickly! 

I picked 5 meat dishes and 1 bibimbap. The bibimbap and the kalbi short rib dish ended up being free after I redeemed my points. A+ for the app and how incredibly easy it was to use to redeem rewards. By the time we finished our meal and I had scanned our check, I was already back up to 300 points! 

All the meats we had were good and it's actually kind of hard to figure out which one was the best. I think we both agreed it might have been the hanger steak? 

We also had their taiyaki with ice cream, which I've never seen on a NYC menu. BF really enjoyed this as he is a taiyaki fan, but he doesn't get much of that in Michigan. 

Service was friendly and prompt. Both our servers were very nice and helpful. 

Tip: There is a parking lot just a block or two away and it's pretty cheap."}
{"text":"My bad review is for their service and attitude because we didn't even eat there. 

We made a reservation for a Friday dinner. Walking there in the rain took slightly longer time and when we got there we were a few (less than 5) minutes late than the 15min window for reservations. And when we got there we were told that our reservation had been canceled. The waitress questioned us if we knew the cancellation rule for reservations. She will put us on the waitlist. I admit that I was not in a great mood after a long week and having to walk in the rain. However, I went for a dinner, not an interview. Even if I was late, shouldn't your attitude be still welcoming than blaming?

Since they took our phone number when I made the reservation, I assumed that they would have called us before canceling the reservation. And their answer was that it's their policy and they don't call customers because of a large number of reservations. And the customers call them if they were late. Then why did you still ask for my phone number?? Doesn't it imply that you will contact us if there's a problem? Besides, it turned out that they actually could find another table for us. In fact, there was more than one table available and there was not a long line for tables.

Even though it is a barbeque restaurant, it doesn't feel warm and welcoming at all. We had already lost our appetite when we were coldly told that our reservation had been canceled, so we left without having dinner there.  We have been to many Gyu-kaku locations in the US. They all had better (even if fake hospitality) standard service like all Japanese theme restaurants. Good luck to keeping customers with your current service quality. I doubt if I will give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Happy Hour is the best!! Great deals, great food..friendly hip atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food was decent.  Service was okay til we were finished n waited FOREVER for the checks.  The waitress overcharged one of my friends by $23.  Luckily they get texts from their bank and noticed before we left.  My bf and I split the Meat Lovers which comes w/6 kinds of meat, salad, miso soup, rice (which we had to ask for halfway through our meal), cheese wontons (they were good but just a dab of cheese..not what we expected) and garlic fried chicken for $55.  I'd rather go to KBBQ n get AYCE for $5 more per person.  The sides here are extra..$5 for onions?  Yea right!  Portions aren't that big....got maybe 5-6 small pieces of meat for each dish.  Nothing to write home about..."}

Pros:
   Nice decor

   Food came out kinda slow"}

Marinated meat and other items, yours to cook with friends over a barbecue.

Well priced for what you get. They have great deals and management is really receptive to client feedback. Great loyalty program and great service.

The Sparkling Sake was a really nice treat :)"}
{"text":"Overpriced ($100+/2 for premium meat lovers combo) mostly mediocre food (too salty, quality of even choice cuts was just not to my expectations) & terrible service (had a reservation yet made to wait to the point we were on the verge of leaving) & our server was difficult to understand.
I don't consider myself the most discerning diner and am generally satisfied with the vast majority of my restaurant meals so this was particularly disappointing.
Can't envision ever going back even though they are in my building (mind you, unlike every other previous restaurant in that space - they have never made even the slightest attempt to be part of our community).  
There are many restaurants in the area that represent far better value, quality & overall dining experience.
In summary, my experience differs from many of the other reviewers to the point that I have extreme difficulty understanding their constant popularity."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this two stars is because the food was actually alright. However the portion size is definitely not worth the money. So don't waste your money, instead head down the street to MAGAL BBQ. 

I always go to Magal, it's my usual spot but today I figured hey why not try something new? Gyu has a great rep in the Los Angeles area so I figured this would be great too. BOY WAS I WRONG.

First off, it was completely empty. Nobody in the dinning area not even a busy night. Took atleast 20 mins to even get a hostess to come greet us. That's a no for me. 

Secondly, the server was trash. By trash I mean, a trash can could probably serve me better! Takes our order but isn't even welcoming? Stared at me as I asked for one of the combos and wasn't really personable. Also, he never even came by to check on my table. The only times I saw him was when he brought out the meats and vegetables and that was it. I saw him SO LITTLE I couldn't even point him out in a lineup if I had to. That's a HUGE NO. And lost all my points of ever coming back here.

Thirdly, it took almost 45 mins to even receive the fucking check! My mom was dying of thirst as her cup of tea always empty the entire meal. Unacceptable.
 
I will NOT be coming here again. I'd rather eat elsewhere where my service and hospitality is valued and not neglected just because it's DIY Korean BBQ. Smfh. I am absolutely disgusted lol. 

USE YOUR MONEY AT MAGAL."}
{"text":"OMG!
went for Valentine's Day. The hosts Tim & Chris know the meaning of hospitality, very attentive 
Special multi course menu... $60 or $80 for two,  what a bargain next to strip alternatives.
Great ambiance,  great food, unhurried service. 
Every single course was delish. Must try is the multi layered green tea crepe dessert... 
They also have happy hour... Going back  very soon .
give it a try, special occasion or not, you won't regret it."}

{"text":"Got our table on time (6pm reservation) the menu options are great. Kinda miss some of my Korean bbq staples, but I get it we are at Japanese bbq.

My low stars is for the wait time after ordering .... we sat down at 6 didn't leave till 9:30 and only had 2 orders filled ... I'm confused WE COOK OUR OWN FOOD HERE! Just bring us raw meat... didn't get the all you can eat full feeling I was looking for.

What saved the restaurant was the good happy hour drinks, and the smores for dessert!"}
{"text":"It was a challenge to find a Paleo entree here.  The salmon and spinach both came with butter.  The salad dressing was way too sweet.  The NY Strip had too much untrimmed veiny fat for such a small portion.   

The waiter was kind, friendly and knowledgeable.   However, I was splattered with the oil on the grill when he decided to change it for us.  I so wish he would have just left it alone.  My thick cotton A&F over-priced t-shirt and Nike fancy shorts looked like the coat on a Dalmatian.   It was just an accident.  

Objectively the food was flavorful, however, there were too many sweet sauces, mayonnaise based dressing, average Miso soup and even during happy hour, the price was not worth the amount of food.    I certainly won't return.   However, if you like sweet flavored dressings, meats and freshly grilled items, then, you might have a good time.   

The waiter was great; I'd hire him.  The food did not impress me."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place good food environment the drink Coktail not too much but the rest great we order the happy hour $50 per 2 person and they brought a lot staff salad miso soup rice and meats at the end they give u smores. We will be back soon !!"}
{"text":"I have been to many Gyu-Kaku restaurants.   This one is bad.  The meet they serve is terrible.   I would recommend selecting some other food than coming here and getting disappointed..."}
{"text":"I really don't want to leave negative reviews but this place deserves one. We've been wanting to try this place for a long time. We came here Mother's Day and the wait is an hour and forty five minutes coz we didn't made  reservation . We didn't wanna wait that long we were  famished so we decided to come some other time. We went back a week later . No host in the front  . Couldn't wait any longer ,talked to the server and  told us he'll get  someone. Five minutes later someone came and told us to wait for half an hour , but there were empty tables everywhere. The staff are not friendly at all. We wanted to try their food but after these bad experiences I don't think we're coming back here."}
{"text":"First time here, very nice restaurant, and atmosphere is great! 
Japanese style BBQ cook your own food makes for great dining experience. 

We ordered the \"jackpot surf and turf\" course meal. $77.77 altogether for 2 people,  exclusive to Las Vegas. 3 course meal included starters such as a spicy tuna salad, fried calamari, miso and much more.. 
Main entree included 3-4 styles of steaks: wagyu, skirt steak, and a few more I forgot? Salmon, garlic shrimp. 
And dessert we had s'mores. 

I wouldn't order the 3 course meal again just because I felt it was a bit over priced. You can definitely order ala carte which is better.

The service was good at first but through the middle to end waitress was hard to track down and this young man by the name of Andrew? catered to us and he wasn't even our server. 

I asked another worker(I'm assuming she was a manager) for a refill and extra napkins and she never came back!! Was annoyed about that. But once again Andrew took care of us!!! Good job Andrew!!!!!
  I will return."}
{"text":"Just wanted to say you guys are awesome! I LOVE everything that you serve...with the exception of the garlic shrimp (???) way too salty so I don't get it, but I'm sure other people love it. I'm so happy my girlfriend introduced you guys to me! yum yum!"}
{"text":"Guys. I'm blown away by the entire experience. I'd heard good things but all I knew is that you can grill your own meat, like at Korean BBQ. For my full review, check out: https://therealmtlfoodie.wordpress.com/2018/05/09/gyu-kaku-a-carnivores-dream-come-true-in-montreal/"}
{"text":"VERY TASTY. Meat is fresh. Service is good. The price is a little expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"Great place and service, very joyful. We were four hence straightforward we ordered the menu for 4. This is a combination with meat and vegetables. I can't remember the name but there was a meat in a very mild spicy sauce with sesame seeds, my god I would just come back for that. This menu was very good, it had a little bit of everything (assorted beef, chicken, pork, shrimps, zucchini, broccoli, eggplants, salad, rice, noodles, soup, dessert).... yeah those noodles were awesome, really. The quantities are ok, not too huge. 2 of us were big eaters so we had to order extra stuff (obviously that spicy beef and the noodles). 

We asked what the table next to us ordered and it was 2 meat menus for 2. I think that is a better option and next time we will go for that.

So to summarize, very good quality food but small portions, nice joyful service, nice restaurant. Would come back."}
{"text":"This place is legit.

We ordered the set for 6 people and we were all satisfied. Meat quality was really good and the service was impeccable. Special thanks to our waiter Matthew for taking care of our table.
He gave us instructions on how to grill meats and also was super attentive on our needs.

My favorite meat is the filet, juicy and tender.
Bibimbap was also really good.
Though I wish they could switch one salad to a dessert since the later was not included in the set menu. 

The dessert menu was kinda disappointing for some of the items are missing in their new dessert menu.

It came down to 30$plus tips per person. Although some reviews said it can goes up to 50$ per person, I think it has to do with the number of people who split the set."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend for lunch and it was great! I ended up eating most of the food since my gf couldn't eat anymore. In the end I had a very happy stomach."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here for our friendship dinner when I was in town. She had previously gone there with her ex and loved it and wanted to go back. 

I was excited to try this place because the reviews looked great and it's a neat experience. I made a reservation for our party of 3 and we were seated promptly after arriving. We had a cozy booth near the front.

We were informed that Monday's were happy hour and we each got delicious drinks. We ordered some appetizers. Although we didn't need to. Our meal for 2 fed all three of us easily. I ordered the cabbage salad. It was light and delicious. I liked the sauce they used. We also ordered some calamari. It was ok. I didn't care for the breading or the sauce that came with it.

We ordered the \"meats\" dinner for 2 I believe. It came with Miso soup, a salad, a ton of meat, and dessert. We ordered extra sides of spinach, broccoli, and shrimp. Our server was very sweet. With each dish he brought out, he told us how to cook it and for how long. The cool thing is you can vary your cook time depending on your taste. I like my red meat a little more rare so I cooked it for less time. 

The only meat I didn't care for, was the pesto chicken. The garlic shrimp was particularly good. Overall, the experience was great. The smores at the end were a nice touch. I would like to go back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Good food at great prices!  Very affordable happy hour, with lots of food choices on that menu.  Friendly staff and pretty nice atmosphere.  The bbq menu is great too, and quality is good."}
{"text":"Update:  Food and service was great as always. However, am disappointed in the underhanded tactic of trying to charge a \"gratuity tax\" on top of my tip. I understand taxes. I am all for a good tip for good service. However, I will never be okay with a business trying to tack on a \"gratuity tax\" on top of the tip I am leaving. The manager even said it was a required tax by law. All I can say is liar and deceiver.  Very underhanded."}
{"text":"Want to say that I appreciate Jarrett amazing customer service. From the moment we sat down he was just great! It was my boyfriend first time there, so he made some recommendations and gave him time to look over the menu. Jarrett always had a smile and continued to check in on us. Fransicso came by and cleared our table when ever we were done with our plate. This entire experience is something you don't get often and with Jarrett we did! 

We wanted to let the manager know how amazing Jarrett was, he was no where to be found and when we asked for the manager, he was too busy, his bartender said that it would take him some time. It made us feel like we were not important enough for him to come speak with us. 

We want to make sure that Jarrett and Fransicso know that we appreciate them for their wonderful service!"}
{"text":"I really like the variety of food that comes in the Samurai Set (for 4) $125. You get soup, salad, around 8 kinds of meat, shrimps, vegetables, white rice AND beef bibimbap

The spicy cold tofu was one of the appetizers. The kimchi was on the sweet & sour side and I really like it since I can't eat anything too spicy. And after eating the 'hot air' bbq food this tofu helps to cool down your throat. I should try making this at home sometimes as an easy appetizer yumyum

Some beef was more tender than the others but most of them are really good. You just have to make sure not to overcook them (it is beef you don't have to cook it all the way)

The bibimbap was SUPER yummy!! The sukiyaki sauce from the beef was soaked into the rice. I would come for lunch one day just to order the bibimbap!!

For dessert, you get to pick ice cream or s'mores. We picked the s'mores because it seems so fun to make your own! Def one of the highlights of the meal

Some differences i noticed between korean bbq & japanese bbq was that japanese bbq doesn't get smokey at all even though there was no vent right above the grill. The surface of the grill don't charcoal up as well so your food doesn't turn black

My first experience of Japanese bbq was quite pleasant thanks to Gyu-Kaku"}
{"text":"I went here with my group of friends. All I have to say is... We all love it!! My friends are picky eaters, usually one of them would dislike a certain place we ate at. But here none of them disliked It became one of our favorite bbq spot. It did take awhile to get our order only because the place was packed around 7-8 pm. I suggest making reservations before coming if you have a big group."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a while now and it's still our fav! This location is awesome and mostly because of the staff. Tracy is a manager here, we love her. She makes us feel like we're visiting family. Bank is always great, we've seen him every time we've been here and he greeted us so warmly, like seeing an old friend. Tonight, Ryan was our server, omg. Awesome. He's so happy, friendly and funny!! We had a great night because of them. We always have so much FUN here. Thank you so much!!!"}
{"text":"Best Japanese BBQ place I've been to, the premium set gives you so much to be shared between two people (6 meats, salad, chicken karage, ice cream dessert, buttered broccoli, butter corn and beef bimbimbap) the service is fast, kind and welcoming. Though every time I visit, it is always very busy so I do recommend people to make a reservations so you don't have to wait to long to get a seat. What was most memorable was that me and my friend got a free dessert (macha, vanilla, and black sesame ice cream with crackers and drizzles chocolate syrup on top) because it was my birthday."}
{"text":"Gyu-Kaku has excellent food and every Monday and Wednesday is all day happy hour. I enjoyed my my time here. Got seated right away and service was great. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Great place, services are fantastic. Reservation is strongly strongly recommended. Great selection of meat dishes and everything is tender. I personally prefer the marinated meats as they are more flavourful. S'mores as desert is fun."}
{"text":"My first time here ... we ordered the Gyu-Kaku meal for 2 people (actually fed 3 of us)... it included Gyu-Kaku salad, appetizers (2 of each) Tofu Nuggets, Pork Gyoza and Spicy Tuna Volcano , Mushrooms, Zucchini, Assorted raw meats (about 6 pieces of each) Chicken with basil, Skirt steak, Kalbi, Sirloin, Filet mignon, Raw shrimp (5 pieces), Sukiyaki Bibimbap (a little too much soy sauce so,it was salty) and a dessert special of Smores (you actually roast the marshmallows over the fire grill and build your own smore). You grill the raw meats and vegetables yourself and the waiter/waitress tells you how long to cook it for. 
I must admit, I believe the Japanese way is very different than the Korean Bbq way to where they marinate the meats because all the meats were bland. They had a choice of 3 sauces in a glass jar: Ponzu (which was unexpectedly spicy), Spicy (idk what kind of sauce this was, it was just labeled spicy) and Sweet Soy. This combo meal was $60.
The only items that were tasty to me were the Salad, Tofu Nuggets and Pork Gyoza. Service was excellent!! 
I would return if the Korean Bbq places closed down permanently, guess I'm already spoiled when it comes to marinated meat and the way Kalbi should really taste... sorry guys, E for effort though..."}
{"text":"Been to Gyu kaku locations around the globe ( Taipei, Jakarta, West LA, Hawaii etc) and this is the worst. 

Came here on a weekday with my family at around 5.45pm.There were only two tables seated with people and no one waiting. The server told us to wait 10-15mins. So we wait 10 mins and went up to her, asking if we could be seated first and looked though the menu as we have a show to rush to after dinner. She went to the manager and told us to wait another 5mins. We waited another 5 mins and nothing happens. We went up to her again and told her we will not order anything from the happy hour menu. She asked the manager again and told us to wait 5 more minutes. We were really upset and left. It's a horrible experience and service. I will definitely not visit this location again."}
{"text":"Nice service and good quality. Really full with order of $100+ for 2 including desserts. I thought its a AYCE place coz i had gyubee Japanese bbq at markham, but it is still fine for me . I like it both. Actually, this place is better than gyubee since gyubee is AYCE so they kinda season or salty on everything to make you eat less. However markham is closer to me, so ill say i will go back to both."}
{"text":"My reservation is at 8p. The host wouldn't seat 2 of us until the 3rd person is here . The reservation is half empty, no one is waiting in line. What a joke! I would order my 1st round of drink already. My first time time here. Already don't want to come back. Hopefully your food is exceptional."}
{"text":"Just as high quality as I thought it would be. Been to another one in Hong Kong several years ago and it was just as good if not better.

First of all, I came here without a reservation on a Saturday night (past 9:30pm) and waited for almost an hour, then left. Came again on a Monday with reservation and was seated quickly. IMPORTANT: reserve a spot AND come during \"happy hour\" which is all Monday or after peak hours. The prices are significantly lower and you obvs don't need to spend more than you should.

We ordered a happy hour set for two and there was a great selection of appetizers, meats, and vegetables. There were definitely other things on the menu that I wanted to try but honestly I'm glad I got the set that provided a well-rounded meal. I found the filet mignon and corn particularly delicious. Brocoli could be less salty though, as well as some meats. Also hoped for tea refills but they didn't have enough. The meats were not overly marinated and the grilling process was super easy. In contrast to kbbq, there's not a lot of smoke and doesn't leave you in an outfit of barbecue scented clothes. 

Anyways, atmosphere was hip and comfortable, with lots of room for food on your table. The booths are also spacious and gives you plenty of room between guests. They play a banging playlist that's like alternative electronic that's not too mainstream. 
In addition, get the app! It's weird to have a restaurant that makes an app but you can get yourself some free food by just signing up."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food.  Small servings and a bit pricey.  Ate here for lunch, but I think it is more of a fine dining spot.   When I ate here I was desperate to find a place to eat to accommodate my Paleo Diet and food allergies to wheat/gluten and dairy. Being from out of town, I found this place on yelp last minute. This restaurant and my server were really helpful in accommodating my needs. Plus the food was really yummy. I had the grilled spinach and garlic, short ribs and scallops wrapped in bacon which was \"to die for\". If you have allergies to wheat, be sure to ask your server not to give you anything marinated in standard soy sauce and they will be able to help you out.  As a side note, Las Vegas doesn't appear to be very GF/DF friendly in general.  I'm from LA and there are tons more options here.  I noticed that Pasadena also has one of these restaurants.  I may try the Pasadena location in the future."}
{"text":"Two of my coworkers were celebrating their birthdays and decided to choose this place.

Growing up in Hawaii where we have many yakiniku places, I've yet to have tried one here in Las Vegas.

I gave this place a 3 star review - I normally don't give such low scores but this restaurant really needs to fine tune their customer service and wait staff skills.

The beginning of our evening was a rough start, but Lily and Anthony did their best to make sure we left with smiles on our faces.

When we entered in the place there was no one to greet us at the host station, so we waited...

I wandered around and it seemed there were only two or three people actually working. This was at 6pm, usual time for dinner, I reached out to one of the employees and we were seated immediately.

We sat and perused the menu and had random conversation, during which time we noticed another table was being seated.

While we waited for our server we noticed the new table that was seated was having their drinks delivered to their table yet no one has even bothered to come to our table to get our drink order...and we're a pretty thirsty bunch!

Irritated, one of my coworkers ask a worker to please take our drink order pointing out another table was seated way after we had already been sat.

Again, not a good start. We ordered everything, drinks and food. [Thank you Anthony who let us know he wasn't a server but took our order anyways.]

Our waitress Lily, as pleasant as she was, started delivering food and some of our drinks. It should've been drinks first and not random food dish items at the same time. What happens there is, my coworkers received their starter dish and no drinks while I received my drinks and no starters. This causes a very awkward and unpleasant experience.

Overall, the food was good. Nothing spectacular, the gyoza is of the pre-made family - I hate that in any Asian restaurant I go to, and I can tell frozen from a fresh handmade dumpling.

The meats were delicious, the poké was good that we order two dishes of it. 

This place may have a good chance if they tidied up the experience and fine tuned their waitstaff' customer service. The one thing I did like was it seems the employees were happy to work there and that stands for something!

Lan and Tracy! Thank YOU for so much for the great hospitality and amazing food!"}
{"text":"Came here to have a dinner date with my dope bf in Vegas. We love this place! The fried rice at the Huntington beach location is a bit better."}
{"text":"Heard so many mixed reviews about this spot so I finally gave it a try. ...oh my goodness, it was great! 
They have everything from Toro Steak to NY and Filet Mignon.
They had a slew of different cocktails, saki, some wine and asahi on tap. :)
We had the 2 for $55 special, it came with ;
Garlic Chicken Balls
Cheese Wontons
Miso Soup
Gyu-kaku Salad
Toro Steak
Filet Mignon
NY Strip
Skirt Steak
And a couple different strips of steak I can't spell haha.
Also came with s'mores !
As extra, we got ;
Ahi Poke Bowl
Bacon Chips (our favorite)
Salmon
Mochi. they had Green Tea, Chocolate and Strawberry 
The service was amazing, manager in training came by numerous times to make sure we were ok.
I would definitely come back and bring friends!

{"text":"This place was so good! I loved everything about this restaurant. The service is excellent and the food was delicious. I am always a little hesitant about restaurants where you cook your own food but WOW! It was awesome. The summer blossom martini is delicious.

I got the $77 special for 2 and it was more than enough food. 

I will definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Gyu in years, but this was the first time I tried this Vegas location. 
First thing I noticed right when I walked in was that they have a full bar here. From what I remember, the Gyus I've been to in LA served just beer and sake. This would be a great place to come and watch a game while sippin on an Old Fashioned or havin a couple beers and some finger food. 

Menu hasn't changed much. They still have happy hour all day except from 6PM-8PM. Their lunch sets are great. Rice, salad, miso soup, and two types of selected meats for just $10 is a great deal, and the lunch sets are available from 12PM-4PM. They still have the big sets if you wanna bring a large group and get down and rowdy. I feel like they go overboard with the marinade sometimes, but I'll just ask for the meats plain next time. The sukiyaki bibimbap is as good as I remember it to be.

Vegas has definitely upped its BBQ game, bringing in Gyu-kaku and an abundance of other Korean bbq spots. I've been to Gyu-kaku so many times in SoCal that I feel like I've been Gyu-Kaku'd out. I will probably want to check out Hobak or Magal before coming back here."}
{"text":"I've been to this place two times now and each time was very enjoyable. First of all you should make a reservation. They were very busy both times that I went and had to wait for roughly 40 minutes the first time as we did not reserve a table.

The selection of meat and other dishes are quite extensive. You have the option of ordering a la carte or off their combo menu. I recommend ordering a combo as they come with a good selection of different meat and side items. I personally prefer the items that come with the samurai combo which is listed as for 4 (also tried items on Shogun). 

The side items were all delicious and the meats were very fresh and flavourful. It was a lot of fun grilling the food and it was hilarious watching everyone stare at the grill hoping the food would cook faster.

The service was excellent. Our server was friendly and helpful explaining the menu to us and recommending a choice. Our grill was changed regularly and our cups were always filled with water. One thing to note is that there is a 2 hour limit to the tables. The person at the front actually came to let us know we had 10 minutes to finish up which I was kind of annoyed with as we were not finished eating. Our server however didn't mention anything and allowed us to continue.

If you like meat and enjoy grilling it yourself then this is a no-brainer. Food was delicious and service was excellent. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I think the 2 hr time limit should be increased to 2.5 or 3 hrs.  The time limit starts counting when you start seating in which I don't think it's right.  It takes a good 5-10 mins to view the menu on what to order and also it takes time for the server to bring our dishes separately.  Also, not to mention that we have to cook the food in which it takes time.  By the 2nd hour we just finished our meal and want to order dessert, the waitress politely gave us the bill as well since the time was up.  Service was great but just only time allotment is not adequate.   I would understand if it was buffet that there is time limit, but not when we are paying a la carte pricing.  Food quality and atmosphere was great as well!  We ordered the shogun menu for 6 people and we added an assortment vegetable platter as well.  For dessert we ordered smores and red bean cake with ice cream for dessert.  Overall, I rate 4 out of 5 stars, lost 1 star due to time limit.  But would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic! Lunch Special is a great value and upgrading to the beef bibimbap was well worth a $3 upcharge. The server was fine, but it was very slow due to only a couple people working tables. I have been here twice and it was a little quicker the first time. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"My review is based on service alone and not the food. 

I walked into the restaurant and they told me it was an hour wait for a table. The hostess informed me there were 5 groups ahead of us so it would approximately be about 30min-1hr wait. We put our name on the waitlist and came back after an hour because we thought the wait was reasonable. 

When we came back, I asked how much longer the wait was and she said another 45min???? I asked how many groups were ahead of us and she said 4. I asked the hostess how it was possible that only one group had been seated in the last hour and she said that they had to seat people with reservations before walk-ins. Uhhhh it may have been nice to be notified that there were reservations and that the number of groups we were waiting on were only the walk-ins. The hostesses seemed completely unorganized and did not know how to deal with people waiting and/or estimating the wait time. 

Here's a tip for you - if you have a full number of reservations then DON'T TAKE WALK-INS. Or at least inform people that are walking in of proper wait times. I may want to wait up to an hour but I don't want to wait an hour and then told that it's another hour wait. 

Another thing that pissed me off was that there were plenty of empty tables when I first came in and when I came back in an hour. 

The only saving grace of this place is that it's a well known restaurant chain and I will cut them some slack since it has newly opened. I will wait a while before visiting to actually eat so that the place figures out its shit and hires some proper service employees."}
{"text":"Really cool place great atmosphere wonderful selection of food very cool, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  But the last time I went the grill wasn't as strong enough. I asked one of the waiters if something was wrong with it but he said no it just takes a while. LOL. 

I always get a variety of meats one of which is the Toro beef. That specific meat cooks from 45 seconds a side. Well guess what, all the meat were taking more than 3 minutes to brown. Everything we had on the table cooked for such a long time. I was so mad, to top it off the garlic noodle served on that day was bland. 

After the meal I asked a different server if our grill was faulty (usually they change the burnt grills at least two times whenever we dine here).  We finished and the grill top wasn't even burnt. He said,  yeah this booth specifically had trouble heating. 

The fact that we could've relocated to a different table when you knew that the one we were sitting at was faulty. I would normally give a 5 Star rating. I still love going to this place and I will eventually update my review to a five star since majority of your staff are really nice. Just venting out."}
{"text":"I wish this were more central within the strip because of how known this place is. It was a good overall experience but nothing fabulous. I truly think people are what make or break your visits. I came in for the first time on a casual date,there wasn't a hot up front but did come within a min of standing. The host and server, not to much personable but not bad either.

There is too many things to decide on so we went with a quick ramen and rice bowl. Both of which came out fast and hot! And very tasty. Service was great as far as checking in and quickness. The music was a bit everywhere but not so much of a bother. 

I was looking for a better ambience in this place but didn't get that which is why I gave a 3 star. 

If you want some yummy tasty food in a cool something to do date this would be recommended."}
{"text":"Solid food and friendly service! 
They have a variety of menus to choose from: cold and hot appetizers, rice and noodles, lots of marinated meats and seafood, and desserts! Very reasonable price for what you get. Marinated meats (I only had beef) were very tender and flavorful. Their garlic spinach and mushroom medley is worth a try. The original bibimbap was also good. The waitress mixed the rice up for us because the stone pot was sizzlingly hot.

One downside would be the smoke. Although they claim to have a vent that sucks smokes underneath the grill, it does not do its job perfectly. 

Overall, I would recommend this place to people who are looking for a solid Japanese BBQ place at a reasonable price in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"One of the hardest things about moving to a new city is finding out where your next outing is going to be. Thankfully I stumbled upon a familiar name. Having been to Gyu-Kaku in Oahu I knew what to expect. 

This isn't an AYCE, but during happy hour the food more than justifies the price. They have pre-set dining options or you can go ahead and pick out different meats as you go with your meal. 

One of the things I hate about doing yakaniku is how long the smell lingers on your clothes afterwards. Here it isn't an issue. Right above the flames/grill is a circle of vents that vacuum out any smoke meeting you enjoy your meal without smelling like cooked meats. 

In all I will most definatly be coming back. The prices on meats and drinks are too good to pass up"}
{"text":"First time here and it was great. I had skirt steak,  mahi and spicy pork. Great concept. The service was outstanding and the food was equally as good."}
{"text":"My time here was great! The service and the environment is absolutely amazing.  My friend spilled his miso soup and they quickly cleaned it up and gave him another one, no charge. It was great and everything. The only thing I can complain about is the fact that they don't specifically let you know what is SUPER HAPPY HOUR and what is REGULAR HAPPY HOUR. 
My friends and I went in specifically for the miso soup during happy hour, because I saw it was going to be 99 cents. What I didn't understand was that I guess it was for SUPER HAPPY HOUR which is all day monday and wednesday but tuesday its after 11 - last call. I just wish they were more specific about that. Other than that tho the deals are a steal, especially the 3 dollar BOGO shot of vodka. That shot is like 2 shots worth ALONE. Anyways I recommend going here but just remember what is actually happy hour and what is SUPER happy hour."}
{"text":"I was do disappointed and upset because this is not Gyu-Kaku restaurant we used to go in Japan. I've noticed good reviews from customers. However, they are mostly from American customers not Japanese customers. Why? I did not see any Japanese customers and waitress are mostly Koreans. I also noticed this restaurant is local gays hung out place. My wife told me there were few gay men kissing at parking lot. I would not recommend this restaurant if you have a children."}
{"text":"There's actually, surprisingly, not many Japanese-style bbq joints in town.  Korean bbq is everywhere but apparently Japanese bbq never got off the ground.  But then there's Gyu-Kaku.  Pretty terrific place.  The food is fairly priced and the Happy Hour, beginning at 9pm, offers great food and drink specials taking off a few dollars on some of their better dishes.

I tried a chicken and a pork bbq dish to cook and then some mushrooms for the veggie side.  And of course some sake to knock it all down.  Really nothing to say but offer my compliments to the restaurant.  Wait staff was good, food was good, prices were good.  I am a fan."}
{"text":"Okay soooo almost everything we had was great!! The only 2 things we didn't enjoy was the spicy tuna volcano .. the rice was SUPER hard and the tuna tasted more like a tuna mayo blend. Defiantly no flavor. The other thing we didn't enjoy was the spicy kabli rice dish. The meat was very fatty and the rice was under cooked so it was still pretty hard. But we greatly enjoyed all of the other dishes we had. PS they have a late night happy hour from 9pm- close. So for sure go check it out."}
{"text":"Finally came here tonight after constantly walking by and seeing people waiting for a table. You definitely need reservations! Anyway, the food was amazing. There was 3 of us so we split the pre-fix $80/for 3 people combo and got an order of japanese fried chicken. It was the perfect amount for us, and we were really pleased with the quality of the meats. I'm basing this off my experiences at K-bbq places but this doesnt even compare. The cuts of meat are great and the garlic shrimps were huge. I will be coming back here again for the chuck rib, our table agreed it was the best."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Came here with two friends and they definately did not disappoint. We tried the meat lovers for two, plus some of the additional specials and absolutely loved it. The house hot sake was fantastic, the staff was very knowledgeable and attentive, and the service was lightening fast. Food quality was amazing as well; I love cooking the meat at the table. 

Overall a great place to bring friends for food and drinks. We'll definately be coming back here."}
{"text":"Blew my mind the value for meat quality and selection provide - highly recommend. Amazing service too."}
{"text":"I think this is a place where you get good bang for your buck. The staff was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. Everything was explained to us thoroughly. All the sauces and flavors were unique and delicious. There was plenty of food for two people. Everything was fresh and clean. We left very happy, full, and with a plan to return. 

My very small complaint is that it gets hot in here. You have a hot grill in front of you and you can really feel it. Dress accordingly."}
{"text":"I was attracted to this restaurant by the sheer number of good Yelp reviews.   Many of them are well written, very informative and guide the reader to exactly what to expect.   We went with a party of 4 and a little one, with an advanced reservation on a Saturday evening.  We  were 20 mins late (Parking is extremely difficult in this area) the hostess was very courteous and re-booked us for another table which became free 15 mins later.    New comers with no reservation were told to expect between 1 hour to 1 hour and a half wait.  Those who agreed could wander around and receive text when the table is free, and they had to get back to the restaurant within a short delay. 

Based on some Yelpers' recommendation, we chose the combo for 4.   Our waiter, Matthew took the time to go over the menu, in French, and explained very well our different food options.  He was great from start to finish. Every restaurant should have a Matthew. The food on the menu was as good as was reviewed, and beyond.   For the entree, the tuna  tataki salad (flash seared ahi tuna with a zingy dressing) and the chicken Karaage (bite size chicken pieces, marinated in sake, amongst other ingredients - perfectly seasoned and deep fried, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside) were out of this world. For the main course, the meat were well marinated, and even though I have a tendency to go for meat, rather than vegetables, I find that the set menu was well balanced with their meat - vegetable ratio.   Meat quality is top notch. 

Happy to see that this restaurant takes Amex. 

Would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Once again, it was a fantastic experience!! We had a birthday party there. From our bartender, Bella, the gereral manager Karsten, Manager Bank. Our wonderful sever Ryan, he is the life of the crew!! He has been our server few times and he always takes such good care of all his guests like VIP!! He makes everybody feel so great!!! Just want to say thank you and keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"The quality of the meat was above and beyond for its price .. The staff was very friendly and the service was also exceptional.. I ordered the beef tongue, kalbi, (must try!! It melts in your mouth!!) hanger steak, filet mignon, pork belly and cream corns!! The portion was smaller than all the all you can eat BBQ restaurants because they ONLY use high quality meat and marinated them with their homemade sauce.. If you value quantity over quality then this is definitely not the place for you :-( they also serve Lady M cakes!! It is a must try dessert at gyukaku ;-) Enjoy !!!! Xoxo"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go to eat  Japanese barbecue. The flavors are great as well as the atmosphere. There are some cool places to get dessert in the area as well."}
{"text":"I was so excited to go there.Because my hometown in Japan has GYU-KAKU as well and i loved Gyukaku.
But I was disappointed this Gyukaku.
We ordered beef tongue.Normally the rule in Japan when someone order beef tongue, We eat first before another meat.while the pan is still clean.so,we can enjoy them with juice of lemon.
We went to there twice. 
Both time, they brought another meats before the beef tongue. Even last time who served us was Japanese server.
He didn't bring tongue first.That Japanese server was always talking with another customer who looks his friend and busy talking and we couldn't be served when we needed to ask something .
The rice was sooooooo hard.I usually want to enjoy the bbq with rice.So we don't need to order a lots of meat and we can stay healthy.
But with that hard rice we had hard time.
I Also have 1 year baby she can't eat super hard rice. 
So I asked if i can change to the another  rice but he told me he can't. But he told me he can put the microwave again.
I didn't know that first rice was microwaved.I don't like microwaved rice. 
Also he microwaved till hard rice.It makes rice more dry.
I finally asked hot water to put on the rice to make soft.
That was not totally my way to eat bbq.I couldn't enjoy this Yakiniku at all.
Finally he didn't charge the rice when I explain that I couldn't enjoy without rice. And I said it wasn't his fault. That is the owner's fault who doesn't know what is the rule for yakiniku(bbq).They just want to make money with pricy price.I feel this owner is not honest.
I will not come back there until owner change completely his or her mind.I want to tell you Gyukaku in Japan is totally different so please go to Gyukaku in Japan or another franchise Gyukaku.I don't recommend this Gyukaku.Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the past month. The first time I ate at Gyu-Kaku, I hadn't even left the restaurant and I was already thinking about the next time I would come here. We ended up waiting for a friend from out of town to be in Montreal so we could take her with us. Gyu-Kaku is now one of my favorite food spots for sure!

Simply put, the food is delicious. During my first visit we ordered the $55 Meat Lovers for 2 course menu and it was a great deal for the price. It included so much food that we even had leftovers to bring home (you can ask for a box). They serve great quality meat that melts in your mouth and is marinated so even without sauce it's very flavorful and delish.

The second time there was 4 of us, so we also ordered the Meat Loves for 2, but added a few à la carte items. We had leftovers this time as well. I've noticed that the course menus definitely tend to be cheaper (obviously), but you can expect to spend 30-50$ per person for dinner here.

Besides the excellent food, there are things I love that makes them earn those 5 stars:
They have an excellent ventilation system so that your clothes don't smell like barbecue and grease when you get home. Also, there's plenty of space between tables and also wooden separators between groups of diners so it's actually a great place for a date. Finally, friendly and fast service. The food just keeps coming and they come to your table often to pick up empty dishes and change the grill if necessary. 

Reservations are highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Probably my favourite DIY BBQ place. The meats are seasoned very well and high quality. The sides dishes that come with the sets are also really good. On there Facebook page it also seems like they have new items regularly. It is a bit more expensive than most restaurants, but it is well worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"Came here for the second time. What an amazing time we had! We were four so we got the Samurai option. The meat was de-li-cious. Portions are generous, we had WAY more than enough. The service was amazing as well as the ambiance. Not too loud, private enough but definitely fun. I would recommend it to everyone and come back quite often. No need to go clubbing, just come here, eat bbq and have a lot of beers and you enjoy yourself more than enough!"}
{"text":"Gyu-Kaku is a pretty big Japanese barbecue chain, but I had actually never tried it before. Decided to check it out for dinner one night after a show. We went pretty late, only a little over an hour before closing, which happened to be happy hour prices.

Service was fairly attentive, and it was pretty empty this late at night. The interior is sleek and comfortable.

The food is of decent quality, and the combo we ordered came with enough food to feel full. Prices were not horrendous.

Overall, a decent place, and a nice alternative to other types of Asian barbecue restaurants."}
{"text":"Food is definitely a 5, service a 3. 

We were a party of 9, & all did the meat lovers course. Meats were fantastic, quality, cut & flavors on point. Miso soup & salad also good. Garlic chicken wasn't the best I've had, small portion but still not the worst. Cheese wonton meh. Valcano tuna could be better. 

One side of the table kept getting all their stuff while the other just got miso soup and watched as the other side enjoyed their other appetizers, then got their meat. We had to constantly check in with the server to ask where ours were. The meat was just too good to be upset about the long wait."}
{"text":"This place is pricey if you go during regular hours, but happy hour is awesome. A mug of beer is $1.99 and a pitcher is $10. If cocktails are your style, they are about $4 or $5. I recommend the Coral Reef if you like Lychee. 

Happy hour meats are $3.99 if you only get the cheaper priced meats. They are better quality than AYCE Kbbq meats in Vegas. If you are looking for quantity, then this isn't the place for you. They also have bibimbap and ramen. Overall, I think this place is a great place to drink with friends and eat a few snacks."}
{"text":"I had a few friends recommend this place as a up-and-coming hotspot in the Calgary downtown area. Even going in with high expectations, I was extremely impressed with the food.

The cuts of meat were extremely fresh, well-seasoned and grilled well (if I do say so myself). The concept was great for people who enjoy an interactive experience. We really enjoyed the casual dining atmosphere, but unlike other casual Korean BBQ places, the level of service was fantastic, especially with changing the grill after every course.

Our group did one of the dinner set menus this time, but I'm looking forward to coming back and selecting my own items!"}
{"text":"There's some decent barbecue here. I first tried them in Waikiki and became a fan of this chain. The Vegas location is fairly large with plenty of tables and a long bar area, good for date nights or gatherings with friends and family. It's better to order a la carte instead of going with the meal deals, in my opinion, and skip stuff you may not really want like salad, soup and edamame. Proteins like the harm miso skirt steak and kale short rib don't take long to cook but can benefit from leaving them on the grill to get a little crispy around the edges. Other items we tried were seasoned well like the garlic shrimp and vegetables. The garlic rice, arriving in a stone pot, will get crispy when left in there. It's a larger portion that can be shared by two people. I loved the slivers of garlic mixed in with the rice."}
{"text":"We wanted to try this place because of the good feedback we had gotten from friends. 

We ordered the shareable meal for 6 @160$ and wagyu beef (60$). 

The wagyu beef came in 8 small strips - although delicious it was so overpriced but worth it for the experience. 

The meal came with: filet mignon, calbi chuck rib, hanger steak, Bork belly, chicken thigh, garlic shrimp and assorted vegetables (among other appetizers which were pretty good) 

We received the filet mignion, pork belly, and hanger steak and the waitress told us that it's last call if we want more food because she had brought everything on our meal. 

We looked back at the menu and realized that half the things hadn't come yet and had to ASK for items that were included in our meal. 

The chicken came frozen (!!) and the assorted vegetables came too. The waitress said that she already brought the kalbi chuck rib but she hadn't she confused it with the hanger steak. 

We ordered deserts that were good. And when the bill came the waitress apologized for the service and said that the deserts were on the house. She came with 2 bills one with beer and the other with the meals both bills we had to pay for. 

I calculated and they were charging us twice for the alcohol because it was already included in the hand written price they had given us. 

\"Desserts are on the house\" 

Who are you kidding? 

I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Wonderful place, my friend recommend this place, everything was excellent since the moment I crossed the door,
They welcomed us with a big smile, they recommend different dishes. 
That have a lunch special, I will come back soon!
No expensive at all."}
{"text":"Delicious dinner! We were expecting many sides included but I forgot that this is Japanese BBQ,not Korean one. My bf said that the place is overpriced with little portions, I think it's enough though."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my last visit. Brought my mom in for the experience but the grill ended up being messed up and only half of it was hot to cook anything. It took forever for our meats to not even cook evenly. Waitress was well aware that that our stove wasn't working, was nice enough to offer to switch us tables until she found a solution of taking the inside piece of the grill off so that it was just the bare flame. Again, it worked for a bit but it was only a small flame on one side of the grill. There was no point to move tables at that point since we've already eaten most of our meats. For the price that you pay for the meats here, you should be able to enjoy every piece, unlike AYCE kbbq where you just force eat every meat in sight. Imagine eating a soggy piece of beef with no char at all or even having a meat take 5 minutes to even get to medium rare when it's supposed to take 2 minutes or less. The flame was so low that it took the whole visit for our broccoli to cook and by that time our cheese fondue had evaporated. Annoyed at the experience and will not be coming back again. Definitely not fair that we got unlucky with the our grill to ruin the meal especially for the price and not being happy hour."}
{"text":"After seeing them listed on the open table top 100 restaurants in Canada I couldnt help myself by to make a reservation (note that you can't actually reserve for 2 people, the minimum number of people for online reservation is 3). They actually have happy hour from 11-5 where there are deals on a lot of their dishes - it's not a huge discount, but it's like 1-2 dollars off each dish. 
I've been twice so far, and I'm definitely going back. The menu is extensive enough that after two visits there are still things that we want to go back and try. It's mostly meat that you grill yourself, but there are other menu options, some veggie sides (like butter corn... Mmmmm yummmm, broccoli (which I think also has butter) and there are some rice and noodle bowls and appetizers as well. 
We tried the bibimbap and the garlic noodles. Personally I like the garlic noodles better, good taste, and I love the texture. There are other small appetizers, such as deep fried bacon and fried calamari etc. The deep fried bacon - as much as it sounds super unhealthy - was amazing, so amazing that the calamari fell short, and I usually love calamari. 
They also have a phone app where you can collect points and get free stuff for your next visit! 
Great food, good prices, excellent service... Can't ask for more!"}
{"text":"they are located in Chinatown-Spring mountain road and Decatur.  As we walked in the music hits me, love their Ultra music they played. We tried their meal for 2 people $45 on happy hour. For starters: edamame, miso soup,assorted appetizers, salad and rice. For BBQ items are hanger steak, shrimp garlic,chicken basil, garlic mushroom and for dessert you get s'mores. I like their A la carte menu and we orderd fried bacon chips and Ahi poke. Unlike Korean bbq there are no assorted sides. The server comes and let you know how long it takes to cook for each items. Overall they were tasty and the service was good.

The ambiance is pretty and the place is clean. I would love to come back and try more of their Ala carte."}
{"text":"Location is great, with a clean Asian style aesthetic with lots of breathing room between tables. Seating is comfortable and the table is large, leaving lots of room for a Japanese BBQ feast!!!

Came here with a few friends and we shared the Samurai dinner for 4 at $125. The quality of the meat was top notch and I really enjoyed it. Everything I ate left me very satisfied.

Our waitress was awesome! Very helpful and friendly. We got our food pretty quickly and honestly the ambiance was great. Love the going back and fro with the chefs!

Honestly, this is a 5 star experience however the only thing that bothered me is that I found several plates a little small. If the plates were a little more filled with meat I would be far happier with my experience. Having 1 or 2 pieces per plate left me wanting and when I left, I was still a little hungry."}
{"text":"Been here a few times on my trips home and always enjoyed it with my brother. A bit pricy but they do have quality meats and a great happy hour menu. If you're visiting for dinner, I recommend making a reservation as they tend to get busy. We've done AYCE every time and some of our favorite items include: Harami miso skirt steak, bistro hanger steak miso, garlic shrimp, Kalbi bone in ribs. Also, where else can you order s'mores for dessert? Must have."}
{"text":"The food is really awesome, but the seats are not that many. I suggest that you should make an appointment before you come.

$50 per person if you would like order BBQ"}
{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(256/365) \"FINALLY In The 702!!!\"

After getting chocolate wasted at Jinju, our party of 8 walked in , no reservations needed.

Wifey and I ordered the Shrimp Sukiyaki Bibimbap, Hanger Steak, Harami(Skirt Steak),
and Bacon Wrapped Asparagus. There are so many other items to choose from, it would have to take a few more visits to kill the entire menu! I like that they have both cooked and DIY stuff so you won't go hungry waiting for other items on the grill.

Service was great, and another cool thing is that you don't smell like the grill afterwards. Can't wait for Gyu Kaku's Happy Hour to start. Its gonna be a busy HH spot!  ALOHA!!!

Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  4"}
{"text":"Loved the Japanese BBQ here. I tried the $35 course meal for two - tons of food that we couldn't even finish. Next time I will order al carte. 

On my second visit, four of us ordered al carte. Overall the restaurant was so busy that it was so clear that they wanted to serve us food and deserts quickly and they want us to leave. The waiters kept coming back to finish us up with deserts and bills while I was still eating dinner or having a drink. Now I know. This place is for a quick good BBQ but not for a good long night out."}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place.  If I'm not eating kbbq at Gangnam, it's jbbq at Gyu.  They are head to head in my book.  The selection is great here and the flavorings are so good.  They just upped their prices for all you can eat which is a bummer, but they have an app that you earn points on for free food and stuff so it kind of makes up for it.  My biggest issue is they don't have jalapeños.  I like jalapeños."}
{"text":"This place was okay for Japanese BBQ but wasn't very memorable. Went with a group so we ordered 2 combos, it's not AYCE. It was all decent, the meats looked like good quality and grilled to be very tender. The sauce they use to marinate was just ok, though everything tasted similar with the standard salty and slightly sweet sauces.

I do enjoy the fact that they have appetizers with their combos. The karaage was crispy and well-made. It felt more like a meal instead of just filling up with meat, so it was good they had combos. 

Server was busy but knowing the place was packed we were okay with it. The serving staff were all friendly. Ambience is good for drinking with friends."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Went w/ Brian M. on a Sunday night. We were there during happy hour (12-630pm and 9-1230am Tues,Thurs-Sun; all day Mon-Wed), but went w/ the PREMIUM AYCE for $35 because they had more \"low carb\" options (so we're watching a figure, so what?). 

Pretty much tried all the meats w/ the exception of the ones w/ any sweet sauces. Favorite cut? Bistro Hanger Steak Miso (21-Day aged angus beef). During this experience, I learned that I don't particularly care for super thinly sliced meat. This was nice and tender and full of flavor. 2nd fave was the garlic shrimp, and the garlic mushroom cooked deliciously on the grill.  

Lots of dessert options including s'mores, macaron ice cream sandwich and green tea crepe cake that I wish I could've tried. Service was awesome! Did a great job checking on us, bussing, and asking if we wanted our grill changed every time we ordered.

90min limit is plenty of time to get your food!"}
{"text":"How can it be so much fun to go out for dinner and COOK?

I want to go back to this restaurant.  It's a bit pricey but when I look at the cost of meat in my grocer, I realize you get a LOT for what you pay for.  You can order a la carte or in 'value packs'.

There is a happy hour with great discount specials and I really want to return for that.

This is a well-oiled ship.  The service was extraordinarily good.  The place was jumping and still; our drinks were refilled plentifully, dishes exchanged often and friendly inquiries made as to our enjoyment.

I LOVE the sauces, the chicken karaage was tender and not oily, the salad was memorable and it was the first time I have ever seen what the fuss about edamame is.

It tastes great and is just so much fun.  The server tells you how long to cook each cut of meat and the veggies come in little packs to put on the grill.  

There were families, dates, groups of people and the ambiance was dimly lit with a very attractive decor."}
{"text":"Yummy / Also I was entertained by the clueless ppl sitting next to me, who was eating their rice using tongs"}
{"text":"I love this japanese bbq franchise, although not AYCE, they offer a good variety of quality meat for a reasonable price. They also have many delicious sides such as their beef sukiyaki bimbimbap & beef garlic noodles. Every time we come here, we often opt for their course menu, which includes everything from appetizers, to bbq meats and desserts. If you use the Gyu-kaka app, they always have promotions and rewards going on. So definitely check that out when you come. I love this place, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"the food is not bad here, but the service is not as good. AND the most annoying thing is that they charge a lot of things that should be include in the combo. So, DO DOUBLE CHECK YOUR CHECK just in case they charge your extra money!"}
{"text":"My friend wanted to come to this place after going to their location in Vancouver and said it's super yummy and they have Happy Hour. 

I came here on a Thursday for lunch and decide to order the Sakura Course for $39.95. It came with:
-Gyu-Kaku Salad
-Chicken Karaage 
-2 Miso Soup 
-2 Rice
-Premium Rib Eye Steak
-Filet Mignon 
-Bistro Hanger Steak Miss
-Shrimp Garlic 
-Mushroom Medley 
-2 Ice Cream 

And we also ordered Toro Beef and Cheese Fondue (omg, so good when it's mixed in with the meat but you have to eat fast cause the cheese will dry out and harden on the sides if you leave it in the grill for too long) 

Side note; their green tea ice cream was so rich in flavour it had that slight bitter taste and super yummy! I asked our server and she said they order from their supplier. I wish I knew lol. 

In total it was about $30 person with tip and tax and the portion was decent. If it was ayce I'd like it 10x more though haha. 

The service was amazing; our server explained how to order from the menu and told us how long and how we should cook our meat and veggies which was really helpful. She also brought out the dishes depending on how fast we ate so that we wouldn't have every single dish crowding the table. 

I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"So i finally managed to make a reservation at gyu kaku and checked it out with a good friend. I thought the service was attentive, but a bit cold and dispassionate.

10min after arriving, we were led to our table and informed that we should leave in 2 hours to allow others to enjoy the restaurant as well. While this may be a valid point and it is more understandable given their popularity, I would have preferred to be informed about it while i was making the reservation. Not every dinner outing lasts more than 2h, but it takes away from the experience when you have to worry about the time...

What brings me to gyu kaku is that it's more interactive and fun than the usual dinner experience at a restaurant: you make ur own bbq at your own table. My friend and I got the \"meat lover's\" for 2. Given that we got raw ingredients delivered to our table, there is not much to say about the \"food\" except that the sauces were nice. Most of the meat variety they serve are quite fatty and thin. So unless you're an excellent bbq chef, you change your grate often enough and you're totally dedicated to moving and turning the pieces, I'm afraid you end up having a very unhealthy meal! 

I think this is a nice experience for group outing, particularly if you really like BBQing and want someone else to prepare the meat and take care of the mess at the end. If you're looking for a peaceful dinner and leisurely conversation with a close friend though, this may not be the perfect place :)"}
{"text":"this is a great place that I always visit for Japanese BBQ. The food is amazing, however the service was not so great. Our waiter who served us was very nosy, as we were waiting for one friend and decide to order first to save time, (this was agreed by our friend) our waiter asks Us twice suspiciously \"are you SURE you want to order? What about waiting for your friend?\"\"wow what a great friendship you got there\" . It just shows that the waiter was no very professional questioning unnecessary things."}
{"text":"Super impressed by this place. Its very modern & clean, tables are nicely spaced out, very comfortable seating with huge tables supporting a wonderful Japanese feast! Absolutely no frying/cooking scents in the air. The bbq built into every table have amazing exhaust fans, they literally suck the air back in, you don't leave smelling like fried onions. Portions are very decent. Their menu style is more like bundles of appetizers, main dishes & 1 dessert at different prices & types of meat included; as is your typical Japanese BBQ. The variety was great, each dish really had a unique flavour, their marinations are very interesting. 

Staff are extremely friendly & engaging, joyfully working. Everyone in the restaurant including the kitchen staff greets you in unison on your way out in Japanese. Would definitely go back again. 

Also, make sure you make a reservation, it's usually busy."}
{"text":"Great place to dine near the strip with good food and music. Fresh and delicious Japanese fusion with private booths for medium to big crowds. Decent pricing and a large selection of alcohol, they even have their signature cocktails and a beautiful bar with big screen tvs to watch the game in addition to warm welcoming waiter and waitresses."}
{"text":"This is a fun venue to dine at. Like the Melting Pot, you cook your own food at the table. We ordered the Meat Lovers BBQ course for groups, $55 for two. It is a complete meal consisting of soup and salad, a nice selection of beef items and a single s'more for dessert. The beef is cut up into small pieces for you to cook up at the table. The only \"fly in the ointment\" was that one of the items they brought to the table as New York steak was in fact, pork. When I pointed this out to the waitstaff he insisted it was New York steak. We cooked it up and guess what? If it looks like pork, cooks like pork and tastes like pork, it's pork. When I brought it to the attention of our waiter a second time he said the kitchen told him it was \"labeled\" New York steak. I should have asked for a manager, but I didn't want to put a damper on what was a great evening. For the record, service was great. Our server was friendly and attentive. In addition, they have several specials and happy hours."}
{"text":"This is a \"Japanese\" style table top grill place.  Also known as a pay to cook your own food place.  

I definitely got the Japanese vibe on my first time visiting.  They have cool samurai decorations and art.  The tables also look like ones in Japan minus the sitting on the floor part.

Both times I came here I went during their Happy Hour later in the evening.  They have a great variety of meats in small portions so it's best to order a few because one order will not fill you up.  

All the different meats were really good.  I tried to Kalbi,  New York Steak, and the filet mignon.  All cooked perfectly (because I grilled it duh)

The sides were kind of A mixed between American and Korean dishes.  I ordered the corn and both times they were kinda burned with the directions they gave me.  Also ordered the broccoli and velveta cheese(fondue style) which was great.  

The complaints I have about this was the service.  They only had 1 server working for 7-8 tables.  The music was really loud which I usually like loud but not when I'm out having dinner trying to have a conversation with.

Overall it's a cool concept with cooking your own food and the staff giving you directions.  I'd like to recommend making having a timer at the table for customers.  I had to use my phone as a timer but it would of been nice if there was a timer because if you're not paying attention you could burn your food quick."}
{"text":"Finally got here for dinner, heard about this restaurant from my friends many times! The food quality is good, environment is not bad, doesn't feel like those typical Japanese restaurants, I definitely will come back again!! Had a great dinner here!! Love it..!!!"}
{"text":"The first time I tried Guy Kaky it was in Los Angeles and it was a blast , a great experience with delicious food and great atmosphere , it was something new and delicious . I was very glad to see that there is a Guy Kaky in Las Vegas and I tried it it was super delicious , the best customer service I have seen in a while , the servers name was JJ, he is a professional . I recommend this restaurant to everyone who
Likes Japanese BBQ ."}
{"text":"The duck is the winner here!  If you know what you want, say three items to grill, you can really stretch out the dining experience and your dinner-dollar.  Check out the appetizers, noodles and small plates sections to get your \"sides\" that are great portion sizes without waste.  The 32oz 'bathtub of beer' helped out in all kinds of ways!  It was really easy to spend the evening here, as after the meal, hanging out at the bar waiting on my über prompted a half hour of casual bar time well spent.  Great service, even on a busy Friday night.  Thanks, Laura for the 'Beautiful Drink'!"}
{"text":"Happily surprised to find they opened a location here in Las Vegas after enjoying this restaurant in Honolulu. Tonight we enjoyed the meat lovers special and the surf n turf. It was a nice was to sample a variety of items. Loved the short ribs!"}
{"text":"Sigh... another place that seems like a tourist trap that lures people in with a snazzy outside and atmosphere. Its japanese barbecue I can tell you that, but it aint that good. Place is dirty too. Its unnoticeable, but its there. The food there is expensive and extremely unsatisfying. Service isnt good either.

Ill start off what matters to me: food because we all love it. The meat is barely okay and priced at a plate of 6 pieces of tuna sashimi from Las Vegas. Its just not good. I got a decent variety of things there that I cant remember the names of and all I know it wasnt good.

The service seemed like a joke. I waved a dozen times and even spoke up to the waiters with common phrases like \"excuse me\" which escalated to \"hey, man cmon\", but nothing came up after 10 minutes. After 10 minutes of stuggling to get attention from a waiter thats walking up in down with nothing in his hand everytime, he made eye contact with me as I raised my tired hand like an attaenna reaching for the heavens. EYE CONTACT WITH ME WAVING AT HIM. Even then I got no service. 5 minutes later I got their attention after leaning out of my booth raising my hand.

The environment is dim, so thats nice and relaxing, but looks can be deceiving. I was just sitting there forcing myself into thinking the expensive meat I had ordered was good and I noticed someone cleaning a table. Nothing to look at really, but as I eat my bbq I catch something in my peripheral vision. The person cleans the bottom the table first and uses the same rag, without any rinsing, to clean the top. The place has tabletop grills, so the bottom is naturally going to be dirtier than the top. Then I drop a peice of over priced meat on the table and was forced into throwing it away after seeing such a thing. Finally, they had music playing. Not any other music, but music youd hear from the first two DDRS. I think I even heard Butterfly play. Its humorous for a place that tries to be elegant with dim lighting and a lot of partitions.

As I sip my cup of refreshing water, I gazed upon something I wish I hadnt noticed. There was dirt floating to the top of my water. \"Oh. Just don't get water here then\" is what I thought, but then I looked more closely into the cup. What i thought made my drink filthy was the ice. I almost puked thinking of the idea of literally everyone in the place with ice in their drinks having a chance of getting ill from a restaurants carelessness. So I decided to get a drink without ice, but woah... dirt was still there. So it mustve been the dishes being carelessly cleaned. I genuinely wonder how clean the back of the house is now.

Pros: they sure know how to hide dirt with dim lighting, and a neat enterance.

Cons: dirty place, bad service, and mediocre food.

Advice: bring your dance pants to get jiggy with the music, reach out of your booth to get someones attention, and try to inspect your cup or plates for any filth.

Im not much of a complainer at all, but I feel like Ashton Kutcher was waiting for me to leave so he can pop out telling me I got Punkd as he points to various plants claiming there was a camera in it.

In fairness I couldve just come at the wrong day at the wrong time."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite restaurants in Toronto and definitely my top choice for do it yourself BBQ style food. There's a good selection of meat to choose from and the meat itself is marinated really well. You can have the choice of ordering individual dishes or you can choose a set meal with pre chosen dishes.

Service is really friendly and servers explain how to cook each type of meat. I would've given this place 5 stars if they only had the white sesame ice cream that I wanted to try last time when I was there. I definitely love coming back to this place."}
{"text":"I was pretty glad they opened one in Las Vegas!  Huge fan of it while I was living in Hawaii so you can only imagine the excitement from all the Hawaii transplants in the Valley when this place opened!  Menu is pretty similar with some of my favorites missing, including the grilled mochi and douyaki.  They did however, to my surprise, Lady M Green Tea Crepe Cake!  Say whhhhhaaatt?  Yes!  However, I found it is still better fresh from the bakery itself.  

Anyways, the prices are about the same, no AYCE at this establishment, unlike the other ones in SoCal, but you are paying for the quality of the meat!  

We did order a bunch of the appetizers, which were quite enjoyable!  No disappointments from our dinner."}
{"text":"I love Gyu Kaku in Hawaii, LA and Okinawa but not the one in Toronto. It's just not the same in terms or quality and authenticity. This location is more Korean influenced and the dipping sauces are subpar. Only 3 dipping sauces to choose from and they r all on the sweet side. 

I was so excited to visit this place, we even waited 45 minutes. For 4 people, we ordered the Samurai set dinner plus 4 additional dishes. Beef selections, stone bowl, shrimp and oyster mushroom were good. Steamed asparagus could have used some seasoning and butter. Pork belly was rancid, it was so bad we just left it. The \"must try\" volcano tuna was a disappointment. No one enjoyed it as it was not visually pleasing nor was it tasty. 

Service was friendly, she checked in often but we can tell she was uncomfortable with the wine selections. 

I was hoping for better condiments, flavour and refinement like the rest of the gyu Kaku I've visited. Perhaps a variation of salt, more Japanese oriented dishes instead of a heavily Korean influenced menu.

Sadly I don't think I will be visiting the Toronto location again but I will always make time for the other locations."}
{"text":"Resto grillade japonais .. comme au Japon ! Buf qualité majeure (grillé par nous meme à notre table!) , ambiance d'une ET divertissante, BON choix de boissons et Sakés...oh yeah j'y retournerai ! Prevoir 2 heures pour bouffer ET apprécier"}
{"text":"Family was craving for BBQ but wanted a different style and we decided on having Gyu-Kaku since my parents haven't been here. I suggested this place because they are familiar with ??? or Yakiniku, Japanese Style Grilled Meats. Since my family and I are from Hawaii, Japanese influence is strong in the Islands so we are exposed to Japanese cuisine. We were quite please with the quality of the meats and the different sauces which created a different palate of flavor combination with all the different meats we ordered. Some of the items that were stellar for us was the Beef Tongue and Beef Angus Rib Eye. Some of the side dishes that caught our attention was garlic flavor mushrooms, seaweed salad & garlic rice was flavorful and consistent. The miso soup was a bit on the salty side. Overall we enjoyed our meal especially the Macaroon Ice Cream and S'mores. 

The only downside was our server was a bit slow and rarely check on us if we wanted anything else especially for something like making sure if wanted more water. However it's rare that service is not at par because most times I've been here in the past, Service was great. Will be back when I or we have a craving for Japanese BBQ."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Steven was a great server and we thoroughly enjoyed our food. We had a bachelor party of 7 people and Steven handled all the booze and the food perfectly. If you own this restaurant, give Steven a raise!"}
{"text":"Great service, we had to wait a little bit but it was quick, happy hour has a really good deals and the whole idea is wonderful. Delicious food with perfect seasoning"}
{"text":"This place is good. I've only had Japanese BBQ at Ishoni in Bellevue, WA prior to my visit here and i would say Ishoni is 5 stars, a notch better. The prices ended up being pretty comparable. Roughly $30-$40pp spent. Favorite items were the Kobe steak, and beef tongue. Garlic rice was good, but would prefer white rice since the meat items you're eating it with is already salty. The garlic rice was too much flavor to eat with seasoned meat. They also sell Lady M green tea cake here shipped from NYC. The fresh NYC version is better, but this is not bad. It just doesn't cut thru the layers as well as if you got it in lady m shop from the source."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite BBQ places in the city! It's Japanese style BBQ, but some meats and flavors are quite similar to Korean BBQ. I'd say it's a bit of a fusion. 

We are 5 people and ordered the Shogun set (meant for 6 people). It was a really great selection of meats and appetizers! Loved all their meat! All of them are super flavorful and well marinated. The spicy sauce is my favorite. Even though it's more of a sweet flavor rather than spicy. 
The BBQ grill has fans on top, therefore it doesn't stink as much as other types of grills. The waiters switch the grill cover quite often so the meats don't get charred. They also explain the meat type and cooking time every time they bring up a dish. 

Overall I'd recommend this place to all my friends! Go there during happy hour (11am -4pm) to get discounts off the group menus and many other items!"}
{"text":"If you're hungry and want to try out amazing marinated meats with Japanese appetizers this is the place to go. Grilling your own meats allows for your exact cooking preference and brings out the phenomenal flavours of their high quality meat. The beef sukiyaki is a must try at this place and the steamed pork dumplings!"}
{"text":"Go here at least once a month. 
All the food is awesome. My fave is the bbq short rib with goyza rice and veggies.  Their sweet shoyu  doesn't taste as salty as the reg version either. 
I add water to the broccoli before adding to the grill for more steaming.
Definitely recommend reservations!! 
Oh and the macarons!!!!   
Everyone is super friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Have been here quite a fee times since they opened. Place is pretty nice and relaxing. Can't go wrong with BBQ beef!!!! Food is really good you just need to know what to order. Spicy cabbage salad is awesome the beef filet is really good. The service is slow at times. They have a bar area where you can hang out if you are waiting for a table."}
{"text":"Bank is the best manager ever. Been there a few times but this time he made it better! Yoshi was our server and he checks up on you helps you with menu. We went during happy hour with drinks too Bank told us their popular drink and it was amazing! Keep up the good work and see you on your next day off!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Food was great but the service was even better. Casino employees get 20% off family style meals. I will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yes! Just yes! Finally a Gyu in Montreal. They've opened their famous chain restaurants in most major cities in Canada such as Vancouver and Toronto.

We went for their soft opening last month. You have to call quiet a few times to get a reservation. Online it says call anytime after 2pm. I say call around 5, when they are opening to get a reservation. 

My friends and I got the premium for two. But since there was three of us, we ordered two side dishes. One was scallop wrapped in bacon (so good), and the second was mushroom (they are famous for it). So good, so good. Would 100% go again."}
{"text":"For the years I've lived in this area, they must has changed this location's name over a dozen times. I would have never made an effort to stop and eat here but my cousin invited to me over for his birthday dinner. 

I don't like the outside set up. The front is facing the street and parking is on the side and back of the building. When I first walked inn, I was surpise to see how well this BBQ place was set up. They had so many places to sit. 

I'm giving them 5 stars because our server was great. We were a party of 30 peoples and he was on top of it. Very friendly and kept up with everyones orders. 

Most the food sizes are small but, it goes great with their small griller. I enjoyed the food and I wouldn't mind coming back again."}
{"text":"This is the best Japanese bbq! The happy hour is my favorite and the servers are super nice and attentive. Soo and Steven are the best servers!!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this spot since it opened up in Vegas. The happy hour menu options are perfect and the food is amazing. We tried a little of everything, but the stand outs for me were the spicy kalbi ramen, the garlic fried chicken, and the spicy pork. I think the ramen here is actually better than most ramen houses in the city, if not all. The broth was perfect and flavorful, the meat is tender and not fatty, and the egg was perfect. The garlic fried chicken comes with this spicy sauce that honestly should just be put on everything. 

We tried the filet mignon which was ok, the new York strip that was actually really good, the edamame..which honestly is hard to mess up, the volcano roll...which isn't what it sounds like, and the bacon chips. 

We'll definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"This is the best Japanese bbq place in las vega because it is so tasty to eat at luck and dinner. I recommend this place to tourists."}
{"text":"This place is great.  This is my first real Japanese-based bbq (not the typical Korean ones I go to) and probably the only that can compete with Los Angeles Korean bbqs (not in price, but taste and quality).

I had Kalbi like in the Korean joints, but I also had butterfish and duck as well.  They had this Spicy Tuna Volcano, which is basically spicy tuna on top of a cooked rice ball.  Needless to say, but this place brought my appetite back (stomach virus killed my appetite...).  

Their size of their traditional grills was smaller than I would've liked, but it got the job done.  My party was small, so it didn't really make a difference.  I was just a little impatient because I wanted all that food inside me as soon as I saw it.  (Yes, my dream girl would say something similar to this).

If you're in Vegas and you have a desire for Asian food, go to China Town and eat here.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My daughter's favorite restaurant. Friendly staff and always a fun experience! Love their beef menu and ice cream macaroons!"}
{"text":"High quality meats and great service! Happy hour prices are awesome! They also have a variety of different items: soups, noodles, fried rice, apps, etc! Such a fun atmosphere worth trying out"}
{"text":"The food is always amazing and the service is consistently on point. Only thing I wish was that they offered all you can eat."}
{"text":"Step aside Korean BBQ, there's a new Asian BBQ that's taken my heart.

This was my 1st time trying Japanese BBQ, and it seriously blew my mind!!!

SERVICE 5/5: 
Me and my sis called on New Years Day asking for a reservation, and the lovely lady who answered said she was able to do that! When we walked in we were greeted with all smiles. Our server sat us down and she walked us through the menu with patience since we told her it was our first time. I noticed everyone who worked at Gyu-Kaku worked together cooperatively and efficiently. 

FOOD 4.5/5:
 My sis and I got the Meat Lover BBQ course (Originally $55, but the New Years Day special was 20% off so it became $44)

-LOVE: Bistro Hanger Steak Miso, Filet Mignon, Toro Beef Tare, Premium Sirloin Tare, Cheese Wonton
-LIKE: New York Steak Miso, Karage, 
-DISLIKE: Yaku-Shabu Miso, Gyu-Kaku Salad

I never was a fan of marinated meat because I feel like it takes away from the natural juicy flavors, but the way they marinated the meat here seriously changed my mind. All the BBQ courses come with s'mores as dessert, and I thought that was a great way to end my enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"My foodie group and I visited this Japanese BBQ last night and overall, we really enjoyed it. 
First off, we were 16 people, we sat at two tables of 8 and management was really accommodating when we asked for separate bills, which apparently goes against their one bill policy for groups of 8 or more, so really thankful for that! 

The space is modern and nicely decorated. The seating is comfortable and partitions between tables allows for some intimacy when you're sharing a table; they do have tables for bigger groups like our too but most are tables of 8 split into two; four people per grill. 

The overall service was good, the food was streaming in at a good pace, and although some was never asked if they needed a drink refill, they were attentive when it came time to changing our grill (5 times!) that was too charred. My only drawback would be that they had run out of sake, so  most had to opt for a regular cocktail which were just okay.

We chose the samurai menu, which came with edamame, miso soup, chicken karaage, tuna tataki, beef garlic noodles, salad, and rice for starters. Everything was really good except for the chicken which I found a little dry but the noodles were the bomb! 

Then came the raw meat, poultry and seafood : skirt steak, ribeye, short ribs, filet mignon, beef ribs, pork belly, chicken, and shrimp. We also had eggplant, broccoli, and zucchini. Time to get grilling! The food was outstanding compared to other bbq spots: great quality, generous quantity, and perfectly seasoned. You can really taste the food; no heavy marinades and spices. The waitress helped with recommended grilling times so our food was always perfectly cooked. 

At last came dessert, choice of ice cream or s'mores. Grilling s'mores indoors was fun and different so we really had fun with this one! 

I would definitely return to this spot! The food was really good, great quality and very inexpensive. Our whole menu was at 32$ each! Besides the sake situation and a little confusion with the bill, the overall service, food, and vibe of this place makes for a fun night out."}
{"text":"Sérieusement, WoW! Je m'attendais à une expérience OK.. j'ai tendance à y aller de reculons quand je sais que c'est une chaîne, mais mon dou qu'il faut pas se fier à ça. Mes copines et moi avons adoré notre expérience. Le service était plaisant, très le fun d'entendre tout le staff crier bienvenue en Japonais! Les lieux sont décorés avec goût et bien pensé: division des grandes tables pour pouvoir accommoder les petits et les plus gros groupes. La musique, c'était bof, mais pas assez pour perdre une étoile. J'aurais apprécié de pas entendre 3 fois la même playlist surtout quand elle contient \"All I want for Christmas\" de Mariah Carey... un 24 novembre.

Mais passons aux choses sérieuses. La bouffe! Nous étions un groupe de 4 filles et avons opté pour \"Le Samurai pour 4\" à 125$. Très contente d'avoir choisi cette option, ça nous a permis d'avoir une plus grande variété de viandes pour moins cher que si nous avions choisi chacune \"À la carte\". J'ai vraiment apprécié la variété de viandes et surtout la qualité. C'est ce qui me faisait le plus peur. Mais j'ai été agréablement surprise de la qualité. Si je peux faire une petite recommendation, ne vous gavez pas de riz, car vers la fin du repas ils amènent un plat de nouilles et boeuf à l'ail et MY MY que c'était bon.

J'ai beaucoup apprécié mon expérience (et mon estomac aussi) et ai déjà hâte d'y retourner!"}
{"text":"Imagine how surprised I was to see that one of our Favorite places from LA was just opened in Vegas! 

Of course we had to go..

This one is beautiful inside... Yet the same as whats here in LA.

The service was impeccable though... something that could be hit or miss in LA... Our server was simply fantastic.

Given that it had just opened, there was periods of long wait times for the food to be prepared and brought to us. However, the best part of that, was being able to eat at a slower pace and eat more!

Food was great as usual.

You will love this place if you like making sure your food is cooked to your liking, since you get to cook it yourself.

Happy hour is awesome as well with lots of specials."}
{"text":"Office lunch with colleagues. Cozy environment, great service, awesome food. Meat was really fresh but you do need some grill skill to make your lunch tasty. Would definitely recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"On Mondays?they have all day happy hour, where select items are charged at a discounted rate.
We came in without knowing this; so it was quite a pleasant surprise! We came around 7 and there was no wait time.

We ordered the two person combo which came with a plate of chicken, pork belly, steak, beef slices, pork slices, pork bibimbap, large salad , steamed broccoli, miso soup and dumplings, totalling only $66 after tax. Each meat dish is around 8 oz.

The meat is not super salty, I would say the flavour is on the lighter side which is good because you get to control how you want it with the sauces. (I did not use any sauces and it tasted fine). The cuts were all tender and cooked relatively quickly. 

Last but not least, I left without smelling like a walking BBQ! The ventilation system in place must have worked and done it's job properly."}
{"text":"Gyu-Kaku was my favorite spot for yakiniku back in Japan..I do like korean BBQ but there's something about Japanese style BBQ that I just love (eh probably biased because I am from Japan). I came here on a Monday night for their happy hour where selected meat/veggies are $1-2 cheaper than its original price. 

ATMOSPHERE
Very impressed with the atmosphere and interior. As opposed to the wooden benches/table and casual vibe of Gyu-Kaku in Japan, this place seemed more luxurious/fancy/modern. It made me wonder if Gyu-Kaku here incorporated Vegas's nightclub/flashy vibe to it. They have this cool lit entrance that makes you feel like you are walking on a red carpet for Grammy Awards. Interesting that they even have a bar..atmosphere here is way too cool for a BBQ restaurant. 

SERVICE
Service was excellent here. All the staffs here are energetic and attentive. Our server named Ryan was beyond fantastic. Since it was my first time at this location, he gave us suggestions, explained different sauces and the cooking time for specific meat. I was impressed with his enthusiasm and knowledge.

FOOD
Good quality meat but kinda pricey for such a small portion in my opinion. I guess it's more about the quality over quantity here because meat was actually really good. I believe I got a Toro Shabu  which was thinly sliced beef and horumon which was my first time trying. 3 sauces they had were ponzu, spicy and sweet soy (?), I personally enjoyed dipping in the ponzu. Ponzu was citrusy and very refreshing, complimented the meat well. 

CONCLUSION
Will be back again for their happy hours!

[Edited to add]
Second time around, completely ignored. Even though we had 3 servers walking by us/making eye contact, they acted as if we were not there. Finally after a good 10-20 mins, one of the servers came up to us only to tell us that kitchen is closed. First of all, why do you even have a poster around the entire restaurant which states happy hour is until 1AM. We were there around 12:30AM.. Yeah, if you guys didn't ignore us, maybe the kitchen wouldn't have been closed? Taking a star off. Extremely disappointed in you, Gyukaku."}
{"text":"Just okay.  The service is great and the the place has a good vibe, but I was not impressed with the food."}
{"text":"Welcoming atmosphere! The food was delicious! The service was great! Very satisfied. The server was very knowledgable. Your taste buds will thank you"}
{"text":"Fantastic meat quality. Got their package for four people and we left feeling full and satisfied. Favorite part was the s'mores for dessert."}
{"text":"Good service she change our grill at least 3 time to fresh one  ! Meat is very good quality . Price is little high but they have happy hours after 9 pm till close ! All drink is 50% off !! Good deal !"}
{"text":"Pretty decent place for barbeque. Don't expect to leave without the smell of cooked meat sticking to your hair, though!"}
{"text":"Our first visit here.  We went for lunch on a Monday so it was Happy Hour all day.  It was really good. I liked the table cooking.  We ordered two lunch items/  The meat lovers and the 3 item lunch.  The sizzling rice upgrade was well worth the extra $3.  In all the whole meal was around $32 and we were full.  We also ordered a spicy cabbage salad which was really great.

The waitress was very helpful and brought everything quickly.   I liked the quiet ambiance of the place.  It's definitely a good place for a date.  I'll go back."}
{"text":"I had recently gone to CA for my birthday and found this place on yelp. By the 4 stars, needless to say I was thrilled when I found out one was opening in Vegas! Our experience in CA was so great I was positive it would be great here as well. It was date night and the BF and I wanted to do dinner and a movie. We went in around 8pm no reservation and the wait was an hour and a half!!! OMG so long, no worries though, they are open till 2am. so we decided to come back after our movie. We got back there around 1230am got sat immediately and we're ready! It was happy hour so everything was reduced in price a little. We left stuffed and only paid $43 with the 20% tip included. Well worth every penny. Will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"I really can't believe that I haven't reviewed Gyu-Kaku. It's not all you can eat and you cook your own food.  I don't mind because I think that I'm the best cook ever. Everything cooks in about 1.5 minutes per side.  I've tried all the red meats, the shrimp, the salmon, and even the chicken.  Take my advice and skip the chicken.  The rest is pretty good and my favorite is their hanger steak.  Each serving of their hanger steak is about 3 oz., it's a little thin, but marinated just right for my taste.  Price for dinner is comparable to the rest of the Asian BBQ places out here.  Happy Hour is a couple bucks off their dinner prices.  In my opinion, you get the most out of your money during lunch when the prices are almost half off.  9 oz. of meat for around $10??  Sold!!  

2017 Yelp Review #9"}
{"text":"This is a Japanese chain beloved by my Japanese friends, it had been on my radar for a while so I jumped at the chance when they invited us for a family feast. I was a little worried about going here as a vegetarian, because it's a BBQ joint basically, and not geared towards the veg necessarily, but we rolled in with a crew of 10 including kids and grandparents and everyone feasted like champs. 

The meat lovers were very happy, the meats are very high quality and the bbq built into the table means everyone gets to cook it how they like. The family combos are a great deal and they take a lot of the guesswork out of getting enough food in the right combinations. 

The vegetarians ordered vegetable garlic noodles and tofu chigae and some mushrooms and peppers for the bbq. The chigae came out with meat so we were a bit bummed at first but our waiter whisked it away and came back with a vegetarian one without blinking an eye. And the garlic noodles were super delish! 

The service was great. Super warm and friendly and fun and fast. The manage came to say hi, and then came back with 2 of his staff and sang happy birthday to the kiddo who was celebrating and gave her a cute crown and a s'more to bbq for dessert. 

All in all a super fun and tasty family experience. Definitely book ahead, they filled up by 11:30am!"}
{"text":"Ive been to the ones in LA but the Vegas location is fairly new. I had a great time and the general manager went above and beyond to make sure me and my friends had a good time. Referred me to a smooth japanese whisky & the food speaks for itself. I enjoyed the duck breast & beef tongue. Im a regular now"}
{"text":"You grill your meats / shrimps / vegetables on the grill in the middle of your table... so simple, but oh so satisfying!"}
{"text":"Already filed a complaint through their corporate website, but had to write it here in order to let everyone know how bad my experience was. This was not my first time here, but last weekend, I visited Gyu with 2 other of my friends to only find out that our favorite bbq spot has definitely gone downhill. We do not want to complain about our server, he was great-Dalvin. However, the food was not so good, the marinades were not evenly distributed, and the fried appetizers were just not cooked right- they were either too hard or cold. The experience was not so good as it used to be as soon as we walked in. We were seated by a female staff who did not greet us or smile at us. She just had a cold look, and when we were seated, our table was dirty. The booth had food debris all over, and tongs were dirty as well- make sure you check their tongs to see there are no food left on the inside of them- 2 out of 3 on our table were dirty. Their sauce pans did not seem too clean either. Later, our server was busy with another table, so we grabbed a person who seemed like a manager, who turns out to be the staff who seated us- her name was JJ, and shew as the manager on duty, she said. She had an attitude this whole time she was handling our need. We simply wanted to order couple more items, but she said that our server will be at the table soon, and that she is just a manager.

Does it really matter who takes the order? Specially, when you are a manager? I would understand if she was a hostess or something else that does not associate with menus, but isn't she the manager? We felt like she said something very irresponsible.  I wanted to complain about all these comments I am jotting down here right now, but my friends said that it is probably not even worth it to someone who definitely does not seem to care, so we did not. 

If the food was still the same and the environment, I would not mind coming back. However, so far, the experience was just so absurd, that I doubt if I would come back. There are so many new spots opening up for great barbeque at reasonable price, not to mention that they are gyu kaku copycats. I don't know if a place with such a customer service would be able to assist their customers' needs properly."}
{"text":"Came here on a triple date with my coworkers.

My bf and I ended up getting the Meat Lovers combo and the others got a la carte items. All courses are 20% off on the weekends so that helped. 

Everything in that course was not bad esp when dipped in either sweet soy sauce, chili or ponzu sauce. The sukiyaki bibimbap was tasty and it was in a very large clay bowl. My coworker's wife got the bacon bibimbap and we all thought it was going to be actual bacon bit but it's actually cubed pork belly, looked really good! Of course she liked it a lot. 

The cool thing is that there is an app you can download to get free food. When you get your receipt, you can scan the code or enter in the code displayed at the bottom of your receipt. Every $1 spent is 2 points. You also get a 10% off when you create an account as well as extra 50 points. 

The only thing I was bummed about was that I didn't know they had a locals discount until I received an email for Valentine's Day meal courses. Locals get 10% off. I will make sure to let them know next time. 

The waiter was also attentive. Always came back to see if we wanted to order anything else or to refill our water."}
{"text":"I really like the lunch specials here.  If you upgrade to the bibimbap it really is a lot of food for the money.  It can be a fun experience cooking your own food but it certainly isn't an \"everyday\" lunch.  Service is generally quick but it still takes a bit longer than most lunch places due to the self-cooking style of it.  As good as the meats are I think my favorites are the sides.  Cheesy corn and the mushrooms stood out to me.  I would like to see more curated options available.  I often have option paralysis staring at the menu."}
{"text":"The food was really delicious. Our server Yoshi was so informative and gave such great service! He was very passionate and accommodating. It's a lil on the pricy side but the quality of meat matches up with the price. It is tapas style. Everything was tasty! The ambience is also so nice! The only thing was the macaron ice cream was so hard to bite! The ice cream was too frozen to be served right away. I would def go back again!"}
{"text":"To start, just check out the way they manage broken links on their website - http://www.gyu-kaku.com/montreal-canada

OKAY, now that we're done with that, let me tell you about my delicious meal! We were seating prompty in regards to our reservation. As a group of 4 we decided to split the \"Samurai for 4\" package for $125 ($146 worth of items if ordered individually). We were served our first dishes promptly and they were good at managing when to bring out the next plates in order to have a good flow as there isn't enough room on the table to fit all of the dishes, while also making sure we always had food ready in front of us. With some items, like the broccoli, the staff dropping it off gave the 10 second instructions for heat and time that you might not have already known. All of the meats were clearly of much higher quality that you'll usually find around Montreal, and the available sauces included 3 options that covered sweet, spicy and citrus. The drinks were reasonably priced and staff were really surprising in their ability to be useful, friendly and informative without being overbearing. There was a great amount of teamwork among their staff that resulted in a very smooth service.

Not so perfect moments: One of our \"appetizers\" was delivered halfway through the meal (Beef garlic noodle). It didn't make much of a difference because it was a noodle dish, but it may matter to others. The Miso really wasn't to my taste. Also, their literature continually references their \"Happy Hour\" specials despite the fact that these specials only take place outside of the traditional hours (their happy hour is before 5pm or after 8:30/9:30 depending on the day - except Monday when it's all day)

I will certainly be going back, probably within 2 weeks, and suggest you download their app to take advantage of their points system (FREE FOOD!!)."}
{"text":"Well, here comes an atypically fuzzy review from me...

I haven't tried Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ until now. It's available back in California and has been open here in Vegas for over a year now, but it never drew my attention until some friends agreed on it as a dinner destination.

We waited until 9:00pm for the start of happy hour (also available all day Mondays and Wednesdays and daily noon-6:30pm) to go. We had a reservation, although it didn't look very busy. The decor is welcoming and the place was very clean, perhaps owing somewhat to self-vacuuming grill helping to keep the restaurant and patrons' clothing free of residual meat smells. I have to confess that I was super tired during the meal in the \"I can't focus on more than one thing\" kinda way, but I really don't remember hearing any music whatsoever being played. Maybe it was soft and drowned out by conversation?

I deferred to someone else for the orders (a la carte of course), and I didn't get so much as a whiff at the receipt, so I won't be able to comment as much on specific dishes as I would like. Our approach ended up being like a \"tasting\" because we shared their portions with five instead of just two or three, so definitely don't be afraid to duplicate orders in larger groups.

Miso soup ($0.99 happy hour, $1.95 regular): it's a standard miso soup, but even in the small bowl, it's a relative bargain during happy hour. Get it if you don't flat out hate miso soup.

Gyu-Kaku Salad ($5.50 HH, $6.50 reg): I don't even wanna know what the half order looks like. Even considering our modest split, the portion seems small, and the dish isn't especially memorable even though it was good at the time. Skip this.

Fried Chicken Karaage ($3.95/$4.95): this is actually one of several dishes that are even more deeply discounted during \"Super Happy Hour\" after 11pm, but no way were we waiting that long. It was the best appetizer that I sampled tonight, and the rich creamy sauce is balanced out by a squeeze of lemon.

Fried Calamari ($4.95/$5.95): skip this. The squid was boring and slightly rubbery. There is absolutely nothing special about it. It's like a pricier, less impressive version of the karaage since it comes with the same sauce and lemon.

Pork Gyoza Dumplings ($3.50/$4.95): also a skip. It's good but unmemorable to a similar extent as the salad.

Corn w/ cheese ($3.95): pretty good, maybe not worth the price. I love corn, but you start to question your sanity with these prices for veggies. That's part of the appeal of AYCE joints, which this is not an example of - you feel like you can still get your veggies while maintaining value. But on that note, I would get the zucchini ($2.95) again, and if I go for Super Happy Hour, I'll most likely get the normal corn at $1.99.

I won't pretend to know all of the meats that I had, especially considering that my friend ended up cooking and distributing everything (on that note, not posting any grill meats photos), but I'm absolutely certain that the Toro Beef (\"beef bacon\" for $3.95/$4.95) was a rockstar dish, and I'm sure the Yaki-Shabu (beef chuck roll, same price as the previous item) and Angus Beef Ribs (ditto on price) were also delicious. Although ponzu and spicy sauce (separately or in combination) will probably be your mainstays, I believe the beef ribs were the one that somehow worked especially well with the sweet soy sauce. Just be sure to rely on the sauces to fill out the flavor because this ain't no Korean BBQ joint.

It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows though. Duck breast ($6.95/$7.95) and beef tongue w/ scallion sauce ($8.95) were both notably underwhelming. Actually, I don't even remember amidst the confusion which piece was the duck breast. As for the beef tongue, the meat itself was fine, but the scallion sauce didn't do much for me. Maybe I expected it to be a little more cooked and buttery, but it just seemed raw (but how do you cook it on a wire mesh?) and therefore out of place.

Lastly, dessert was a bit of a downer. The macaron ice creams were decent but not worth the $5. I liked the green tea ice cream inside a strawberry shell, and also the mango. I didn't enjoy the taro shell w/ vanilla as much.

All in all, I enjoyed most of the meats, and happy hour pricing was pretty nice, so I would consider trying Gyu-Kaku again. It's a change of carnivorous pace from the KBBQ places."}
{"text":"My brother and I had ordered the gyu-kaku course and it was delicious. Didn't really think it'd be enough for the both of us, but I ended up getting a food coma as if I had all you can eat kbbq. Starting from the appetizers, everything was so flavorful. You end up wondering just how good the next course will be. Photos are attached, but tbh, I was too excited to eat that I did not take as many as I had wanted to in the beginning.

As for service, I believe I counted around 5 that came to us, asking if we needed anything in the most polite manner. 

The interior was beautiful, extracting older Japanese themes with a modern touch. My experience here seems very worthy of the 5 star rating I've given. I would note that the price is higher than your average casual dinner, but it is worth both the experience and the food."}
{"text":"Gyu-Kaku came in out of nowhere into the downtown core, set to prove that Japanese BBQ is among the Korean BBQ joints out there, and they've definitely got the flair to compete.

Gyu-Kaku is replacing Kirei Sushi, a local sushi restaurant located near the edge of the financial districted. With all newly opened restaurant, the restaurant was packed upon my arrival. The total wait time was very long, so be prepared to commit if you want to try this out.

Once we sat down, the service was excellent. We were given clear explanation of the dishes and the structure of the menu, and were offered personal suggestions. Throughout the night, the food was provided at a mannerly pace, and never rushed, despite being bombarded by line-ups of those who eagerly wait outside.

Onto the food. For the price you pay, the variety of BBQ selections were vast. The meat selection, though raw, were nicely presented. The quality of the beef (fillet minion) and pork (pork belly) shined, as the taste was very clean, and tasted fresh, not frozen. The appetizers shared the same quality as the meat itself, ranging from traditional gyoza to chilled tofu, it was simplicity at its best. Some of the appetizers such as the bibambap were great shareables to begin with as well. 

While this might not be the best JBBQ or KBBQ I've been to, it is a great addition to the downtown core, bringing premium meat and clean flavours to those who wants more out of a asian BBQ joint. Recommended."}
{"text":"This place is great! Happy hour prices are beyond reasonable. It's a very clean establishment and it has good music. It offers a good variety of beers and different menu options. The staff is very friendly. Our server was Yoshi and let me tell you, Yoshi is THEBOMB.COM we will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed gyu-kaki ever since the first time I tried it in Hawaii back in high school.  

We ordered the beef tongue, garlic shrimp, spinach garlic (awesome), yaki shabu miso, harami skirt steak miso, Kali short rib, sukiyaki bibimbap, assorted appetizers, and boy did we eat a lot!!!

They ran out of scallops and tofu nuggets - too bad!

Service is five starts. 

Very happy and will return. Thanks gyu-kaku team!"}
{"text":"It is a bit pricy in my opinion compared to other Korean bbqs in town (we did not come at happy hour) , considering Gyu-Kaku does not have AYCE. Said they will in perhaps a month or two, so that's good. But the restaurant laid out beautifully, not crowded and has great atmospheric lighting. The staff seems to be pretty great here as well. We got the 55$ meat lovers course for 2 and it came with a lottttt, so I think the price is worth it."}
{"text":"Gyu-Kaku est une place à découvrir. Bien que ce soit une chaîne, la nourriture et l'expérience en soi fût à la hauteur de mes attentes. 
Depuis quelques années, on retrouve plusieurs restaurant à Montréal de type grillades à volonté. Côté quantité c'est super mais la qualité n'est définitivement pas là. 

Avec l'arrivée de Gyu-Kaku, c'est une nouvelle game. 

Viande et fruits de mer d'une fraîcheur irréprochable.

Service rapide, attentionné et courtois. Les serveurs vous donnent même le temps de cuisson suggéré pour chacune des viandes. 

+++ Notre serveuse a entendu que c'était mon anniversaire à travers nos conversations et j'ai eu une crème glacée surprise avec le chant et tout le tralala :)

++++Le resto possède une application mobile qui attribue des points de fidélité super facile à utiliser. Vous pouvez reserver en ligne et échanger vos points pour des items du menu. 

Est-ce qu'on y retourne ? Définitivement!"}
{"text":"Was just here, and was told that there would be a 45 minute wait. After an hour into waiting, we went to check if there are any takes available yet, but there is still a 45 minute wait. 

Granted we didn't make a reservation, but I can't recommend a place that doesn't respect my time. If there's going to be a long wait, that's fine just tell me up front. Don't pretend there's a shorter wait time just to get me to wait.

It's unfortunate, because the food that they serve actually tastes good."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed. All day happy hour on Monday's & Wednesday's. The food is great and the drinks are cheap. 

Make sure you get their app for great deals! But be cautious with using your rewards - the program isn't very detailed and you can only use one at a time (which then prevents you from using it next time. Yeah, I'm confused too.)"}
{"text":"Everything are Delicious!! All staffs are very friendly.... I can say 5 stars service to our waitress Emili. All dishes are very tasty, each table have a grill which make our dining very FUN and warm. Love it!! I highly recommend this restaurent."}
{"text":"Very solid choice of diy bbq, best in Montreal imo. For lunch there's a special where you can select 2-3 meats and get a salad a soup and a bowl of rice.

We came out of that lunch very satisfied :D"}
{"text":"Just a little 5 mins walk from Concordia metro you can find this amazing restaurant. Hands down my favourite Japanese BBQ place. During lunch time, they have a super cheap combo of 2 to 3 choices of meat with rice and miso soup for around 13-17$. For supper time, if you are a group of 4-5people I definitely recommend the Samurai combo! You will get to taste a variety of food! And they are all oh so delicious! Oh and do not forget to collect your points from the bill. You can easily get 25$ off"}
{"text":"The interior of the restaurant is really nice and has a comfortable feel. The food was amazing, we got the deal for 4 people and it was enough to fill us up (we weren't hungry after but we weren't bloated either). The combo was nice because we got to try a variety of meats, vegetables and entrées. Personally, my favorite was the fried chicken a lot and the porc belly fat. 

The staff is super friendly and asked us if we wanted to change the grill a couple of times (which I find is pretty rare in BBQ places, especially the AYCE ones). 

My only complaint is the price, it's pretty expensive, but I think the food and service is worth it! It's definitely a place to try out. Also, we reserved to make sure to have a spot and since their opening hours are very limited, it was a bit of a hassle."}
{"text":"Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ is located on 6 Ave SW downtown Calgary.  It was my \"N\" times having lunch at Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ, but it was my first time having food at Calgary location. Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ has three locations in Vancouver and one in Calgary.  The one I've been is in Calgary. The same as before, I have ordered lunch combo - Beef  Tofu pot with salad. The price of the food was a little bit more expensive than Vancouver locations. The salad was fresh and the taste of the salad was the same as other places. The tofu soup was different from other locations. The taste was decent, but I like Vancouver more. In summary, the food in Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ  was OK. Not very excited. Miss Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ  in Vancouver."}
{"text":"Gyu-Kaku has been on my radar for the last little bit. When it first opened, we attempted to get a seat only to be told it'd be a two hour wait. We decided to make a reservation and come in another night.

The day finally came and we were greeted by an awesome wait staff. Some might find their staff overbearing but I actually found their service was top notch.

You can order meat a la carte or through their value combos which is an assortment of appetizers, meats, and desserts. These are supposedly cheaper than if you had ordered these items individually but the amount of people who want to verify this is probably slim to none.

We opted to get the \"Meat Lovers\" value combo which is aimed at 2 people for $55. We were bummed that we couldn't swap the ice cream out for the s'mores.

Gyu-Kaku is known for their quality meat. For the most, I agree that some of this meat is very decent quality. However, there were some sets that were nothing special but were still quite good. The highlights of the set was easily the steak misos.

For dessert, we had green tea ice cream which was actually quite good. Once again, we were disappointed that these items can't be swapped as we really want to try the s'mores.

Overall, I really enjoyed my time here. It was a decent price for BBQ for two despite it not being AYCE. The meat quality was quite good but only slightly better than other BBQ places. Besides the s'mores, there is nothing here that makes it stand out.

I'd recommend to check it out at least once as the food was quite yummy!"}
{"text":"Went here for Happy Hour at 5-6pm. LOVE THE HARAMI SKIRT STEAK!! Super juicy!!! I am also amazed on how fast the grill cooks the meat. I'm sad that they don't have AYCE, but its okay because I had a good experience here. Our waiter was very attentive to our needs despite it being busy during this hour. The desserts were delicious as well, I had the Lady M's Green Tea Mille Crepe (really creamy!) and Chocolate Lava Cake w/ Ice Cream (it melts in your mouth~). 

I notice if you do sake bombs the bartenders in the back start screaming super loud in excitement! It was a rather amusing sight to see lol."}
{"text":"Fun!! Good meat, great service (ask for Alex;-). Meal for 2 will easily feed 3!
And don't forget the black sesame ice cream to top it off"}
{"text":"Wasn't too impress with the sides. We got the mushroom, garlic noodles and kimchee. Kimchee was definitely not the traditional kimchee you'd think. Totally tastes different. The meat selections were really good though. We had duck, pork belly, Kobe Kalbi, and scallops. Definitely coming back do the meat. Although don't expect. Huge servings. They're about 3oz of meat, so I recommend ordering 4 kinds of meat and two side dishes."}
{"text":"Where to begin with the list of issues...Good food but terrible service! The server was impatient with us right off the bat. None of our food came out together. Rice, veggies and cheese came out after we were almost done with our meat and after all of that we still never received our chicken. We ordered the happy hour meal for two. I had three sets of dirty tongs as well before I found a clean set. Overall the place was dirty, the windows were filthy and it just had that feeling of grime everywhere. The best thing that the \"manager\" was able to do was a 15% discount!! 15% was $5 dollars off!! Not worth my time to have pulled him aside! This was my first time at this location and my wife said that to So-Cal location was so much better! I do not think that I would return! They need new management that pays attention to detail for sure!!"}
{"text":"One of the worst organized places I've ever seen.  Came here for a table for 3 at 8pm on Thursday without a reservation, but I was willing to wait.   They said 30-45 ... Ok fine.  1.5 hours later, nothing.  Always, 10 more minutes ... The reception area is vacant without an employee for 20 minutes ... I timed them so I know.  There was an empty table in front of us that would fit us perfectly available for at least 15 minutes, but they couldn't give it to us because \"that section is not in a waited section and servers wouldn't really have the time\".  If you don't have the staff, don't make stuff up so we can go somewhere else.  Don't waste our time.

By the way, I'm still here waiting."}
{"text":"Good Japanese BBQ.  This is apparently a national chain with 45 locations, but each location is fairly unique.  There are great lunch deals, rotating specials, happy hour specials, and all you can eat options -- the menu is complex.  Plus, there is a smartphone app based loyalty program.  However, the food is simple and good -- various forms of meat and vegetables to bbq on the table, as well as Asian noodle and rice dishes."}
{"text":"This has become a standard date night for us- generally always a happy hour or at least a great price. The food is brought out promptly and everything that is supposed to be hot comes out just that. The meat that's brought out is so delicious. Better than other places we've been to. Great customer service and the sake is good;)"}
{"text":"It's a nice place to eat with friends.  The prices are a bit expensive unless you're splitting with friends.  I suggest going during Lunch Time on a Weekday where it's cheaper.  I ordered the Meat Lover set and they some of the meat was more memorable compare to the other meat they serve.  I always enjoy the desserts where the taiyaki and smores you can cook above or on the grill~"}
{"text":"If you've been to Gyu-Kaku in Japan or New York City, you'll agree with my 3 star rating. If this is your first time at a Gyu-Kaku, maybe you would give it a 4. 

Having been to multiple Gyu-Kakus before this, I had high expectations of this restaurant. The staff and restaurant itself were great, however the food didn't live up to the hype. 

Both Bibimbap bowls: I think it would be more appropriate to call them stone cooked fried rice bowls, rather than bibimbap. There were no vegetables, gochujang or egg in the bowl. It was just rice and some meat! 

Kimchi: Disappointing :(

Meat: Ordered the skirt steak and kalbi short rib. Good, but not special enough for me to go back to Gyu-Kaku for. 

If you're looking to eat meat, try a different restaurant on Spring Mountain!"}
{"text":"The good: yes! Finally been craving for a new Japanese place to open. Although I did not expect the hype that came along with this restaurant, I was lucky enough to get in... Just over an hour..! But the good is about it is that it is the first supposedly authentic Japanese BBQ in Toronto (but so sooo similarly to chako - except with the premium meat). The greatness about this place was the service! It was great!! Promo for their soft opening is 20% off their set menu - which was totally worth it imo (but if it's regular price, we hitting a tad pricey). I had the geisha set. The sukiyaki bibimbap was totally unexpectedly the best dish out of there. S'mores is always good no matter where you eat it (I found it fun actually roasting the Marshmellow over the grill). I love their soft opening promotions and the upbeat personality of their staff. However...

The bad: it is exactly what Chako offers except with the premium meat, but even with that sometimes I feel that the meat taste like anything else. As much hype surrounds it, it's exactly what it is, Japanese BBQ (but BBQ is pretty much the same everywhere). I didn't experience something that was mind blowing or something that would make me go, ohh I have to come again. IMO this place is a one and done place. Gave it a try and onto the next one.

The ugly: wowwww the wait is ridiculous!! I went at around opening time at 5:15, but had to wait 1 hr and 20 min. People that came in at 5:30 had to wait 2 hours. Like I said, it's worth going to try once people, but don't get too hung up on it! 

Neutral: go early! If you want a table for a big group. If not be prepared to wait hours (lucky it's close to Eatons). Good to go with biggggg groups because there is a set menu for groups of people with more items to try and a cheaper price (yay!)."}
{"text":"Went here on November 8th for my sons Birthday and I have to say..it was a very enjoyable and pleasant experience.  The food was good and our server Henson was awesome!  Great atmosphere .. good eats.. come experience and if you get Henson..definitely a plus!"}
{"text":"A recent UYE took us to testing out this new addition to our fair city. 

Location: Out of this world smack dab in a great spot just south of St Cath on Crescent in the Central part of downtown. 

Cleanliness: being a JBBQ place these tend to be a bit smoky, however place is new modern and you barely get any aroma of smoky soy sauce meat being grilled. Perfect exhaust fans around the grills do a fantastic just of keeping the smoke and aroma under control.

Price: Depending on what you choose and eat expect to pay in the $30-50 range pp for dinner. They do have group dinner meal prices. Value is a tad better as it's a whole meal deal. We ordered the $140 for 4 people plus a pitcher of Sapporo. With tax and 15% tip on my visit I was $49.25. 

In Montreal there is already a plethora of Korean BBQ places and this popular chain is a new addition for Japanese BBQ. For me K and J BBQ are close cousins. Many of them are 3* to me as they lack on service or quality of meat or both. Call me a snob but I've been fortunate to have my fair share of excellent KBBQ & JBBQ. 

Places I've fondly enjoyed in other cities are where it's AYCE and a huge cold buffet and you fill up a massive mountain of Bulgogi, Seafood, Kalbi and then grill it at your table like a hungry caveman. Other establishments they have menu items and bring out as much as you want till the meat sweats start after about hour 1.5. Other Asian BBQ joints its AYCE sushi mixed in with BBQ. Lastly some of the places in Asia they mix in AYCD (drink) to wet the mouth as you are eating copious quantities of meat. These places tend to be the loudest as patrons inhibitions get lost in the beer.

Here at Gyu Kaku the focus I would declare is on very high quality meats. They don't serve huge quantities per dish however the meat is of very high quality. Juicy flavourful and downright delish.  

They do pre-warn you as you enter the place. It's a 2 hour limit for dining. 

Another positive is the seasoning of the meat is not overly salty with soy sauce or sweet. Seasoning was actually about right in my opinion. 

Starting off with salad and then onto the meats. I believe it was the kalbi and ribeye which were one of the first served were the best. The garlic noodles I could have eaten the whole bowl! Then plate after plate of more meat. Quite a bit more! Some veggies and they ended off the meal with the chicken (very smart as you don't want to contaminate and mix meats). Everything was planned out and food came out fast. You have a choice of ice cream as dessert and my green tea was nice to finish off. 

Service was very attentive and professional. 

Only downside i would say is portion size per plate is a bit small. The veggie plates could have been a bit more plentiful. However they do serve you quite a bit of variety. Also after the meal I didn't feel super full however 20 mon after it set in and I was stuffed. Kind of like a creep up on you content full feeling.

Definitely a place I look forward to returning again and an overall pleasant higher end Asian BBQ dining experience. 

Make reservations... it's a popular place."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to my bf and I from a friend of his who told us that Korean BBQ is old news and that we need to try Japanese BBQ haha. After coming to Gyu-Kaku, I have been converted! 

I must say that the selection of meats, apps and drinks is quite plentiful which had my bf and I a bit confused as what we really wanted to try since, this is an a-la-carte place. Luckily for us, our server had suggested that we may wish to try one of the value courses. So my bf and I ended up going for the \"meat lover for 2\" course, along with getting a few side apps that we wanted to really try (takoyaki, spicy tuna volcano, karaage, shio negi tofu were all yum! Except for the shishto pepper which was tough and rather charred too much, as well as bitter - wouldn't reccomend it) and sake cocktails as it was happy hour time (11:30am-5pm), therefore prices were reduced! 

The atmosphere and service was quite top notch as well, with our server being rather engaging in checking in on us from time to time, as well as assisting with cooking and cooking tips for the meats. Some meats stood out better than others, for me it would have to be the toro beef and hanger steak  Would deffinetly come back!"}
{"text":"Great light night hang out. Awesome happy hour!! Good food with good company. Can't beat the super happy hour deals where a-la cart apps meats and veggies that range under $5! And drinks are also under $5! We always go in late and don't make reservations they normally seat us under 10 min. 
Not to be confused with the Korean style KBBQ. The Japanese meats are flavored differently and have different types of cuts. And best of all. The vent is right above the grill that sits inside the table so once the meat starts cooking. The smoke doesn't have a chance to transfer to you!"}
{"text":"On my usual rounds of scrolling through facebook, I saw that my friend was at his favorite place in Vegas to eat (gyukaku) and immediately wondered why I haven't been back in a year. I realized why which i'll get to later in the review.

Setting: In a fairly large and quiet plaza by the vietnamese market and near the smokin crawfish restaurant. When you see this place you almost get the feeling why something that looks so nice be located here? Bright white lights and modern decor make it out to be a high class establishment so taking a date here would definitely give the impression of quality. 

Choosing your food: You can go a la carte or choose the set meals they offer. Personally I think choosing the set is your best bet for the first time and choosing a la carte the second visit when you know which meats are right for you. 

Meats: They offer several cuts of meat and prepared with different types of marinades which is a big problem for me. All of the meat is in some type of sauce and seasoning which overburdens the meat and ruins its true flavors. Yeah I know some meats are suppose to be marinated (kalbi, bulgogi, etc) but all of their meats seem to be soaking in sauce. I think we can all agree that marbled meat is the best meat. The beef items that we got on the meat lovers seemed pretty tough and chewy which is a big disappointment. 

Happy Hour: All day monday and wednesday is pretty sweet! A good amount of the items on the menu are about $1 some $2 off. A mug of sapporo during the summer happy hour was only $1.50. 

Overall: I think it's a cool place to go for a nice evening of drinking, grilling, and chatting with a group of people, but all the meat being marinated and pretty tough fails to want me to come again for food."}
{"text":"This was the best place to go for a birthday dinner! We had a very large party and Ryan the waiter was super patient and attentive! The food was amazing and he managed to ensure we all ate at the same time spite of a few in our party arriving late. I definitely recommend it to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"Super good, went to dinner here on a Sunday night and did a $35 AYCE can eat deal. The food was quite good and I enjoyed the ambiance. I think the price is fair for what you get and I'm sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"Maybe 3.5.  Decent for what it is, meat is not the highest quality and can be a bit chewy.  Fairly fun atmosphere, and currently running an opening special for 12 dollar pitchers of sapporo.  Check your bill afterwards, we got 200 dollar set meal, and they added that plus charged every item individually as well so the bill was 200 dollars more...  they fixed it though after we pointed it out.  One big miss was the chicken karage, very bland not not very crispy crust."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

Gyu-Kaku has finally opened in Toronto (okay, it's opened since my last visit to Toronto back in December). A place where I wasn't familiar with the meats when I first tried in LA, I get to have another shot in seeing why this place is so popular among foodies.

I arrived on the night of Labour Day, and it was reservations only (no walk-ins). Thankfully my dad reserved beforehand, so we did get a seat.

Gyu-Kaku is a yakiniku restaurant, meaning it specializes in grilled meat. There's a grill in the middle of each table where you grill your meats once they arrive. Monday is a full day Happy Hour (regardless of holiday), so if you want some sweet deals on meats, come on a Monday night.

I had the kalbi soup to start, followed by the premium meat lovers meal. I loved every meat offered, especially the miso skirt steak, toro beef, and New York Steak. The bibimbap was also really good, as well as the chicken karaage. I could probably do without the salad next time, but can't complain too much since it comes with it. If you can't afford the premium meat lovers, the meat lovers option is quite good as well.

Service was excellent, the workers are also very knowledgable about the menu. Definitely a highly recommended place if you love your grilled meat."}
{"text":"Gyu Kaku has consistently good food so 5 stars for that but service is always hit or miss and crazy inconsistent depending on who you get and when you come. You either have a server on top of it or a server with missing and forgotten orders ... there's never an in-between.

Recently though, came to have dinner with my mom on 5/3/15, and was seated at a table with an obnoxious party next to us separated by one of their dividers. Two blonde chicks were loud, irritating, and wholly inappropriate (they were grabbing at each other's underwear). My mom was crazy uncomfortable and the Gyu Kaku store manager was sitting with them kicking it like nothing they were doing was outrageously inappropriate.

So like, have a one star review. Kthxbye."}
{"text":"Our server was friendly and took great care of us. I ordered the meat lover lunch combo, came with salad, soup, and gyoza. The portion was just enough. Loved their salad cause there was egg, tomato, cucumber. It wasn't just a salad they tossed together, it was a good legit salad. They marinate all the meat and it was tasty. I saw their drinks for happy hour and would come back for their happy hour. Looked like they had a great happy hour."}
{"text":"Food was good and service was good when we could get them to come to your table. 

Need more veggies choices too much meats but not enough options for veggies."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time the other day with my cousin & friend. Spent about $134+ for the amount of food we ordered which was not bad at all! Loved everything we tried off the beef menu, only had pork belly off pork menu, then had the garlic shrimp along with bacon wrapped scallops which were also good but the bacon wrapped scallops were a little salty but with sweet soy it cancels out. Our waiter Henson did an amazing job with top notch service, was always attentive checking up on us. He's a very recommended waiter from the 3 of us, cool guy who loves to joke! Ask for him next time :)"}
{"text":"Very awesome happy hour. I've eaten here twice now and both with different company. And I know they've brought their friends here the next day. You needs all you can eat BBQ when the amount they serve you is already going to fill you up. Their meat is full of flavors and I believe it was the brisket. OMG soooo tender. Definitely coming back here and bringing more company."}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour. The meats were good. Although our server mixed up our orders with the table next door and screwed up the bill, everything else was alright. 

I've been to the LA and HI location and must say that LV does not have as much choices as the other places. I would hope for them to put in more items in the future. Otherwise it would have been 5stars."}
{"text":"This was a great place to go and grill beef, pork, chicken, vegetables, and many more. I enjoyed the experience because the service was speedy, and the food delicious! I tried the 3-person option and I felt the price was equal to the proportions you got.

Overall, I would recommend if you like to eat for 1-2 hrs stay."}
{"text":"Been here twice. I really enjoy the food. Brought my kids here on the second visit and they really enjoyed their udon noodles. Service is friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Amazing food! We went on a Friday night around 5 and there was a 15 minute wait. By the time 530 rolled around the wait was 1 hour. If you plan on visiting, it's best to make a reservation. We ordered the meat lovers for 2 and a pitcher of Sapporo, which came up to $80. The meat just melts in your mouth and you can tell it's been marinated. The other side dishes are also really delicious and the service is amazing. They explain everything to you and how long it takes to cook the meat. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant about 5 times and they always have such great customer service and the food is amazing. We had a work dinner this last time I went and Shaelynn (one of the managers) was great! She was always available when I called to speak with her about number of people and different menu options for our party. She even arranged it so we didn't have to wait for our appetizers. When we arrived our table was set up with the first course all ready. Our server Soo was extremely nice and hosted the table with ease, lauggt and joked with us. My friends/co-workers abd I definitely enjoyed ourselves and we highly recommend this place! Take it from us...we're all concierge."}
{"text":"Love this place. I have tried the same restaurant this March at Oahu. Happy to see it comes to Toronto."}
{"text":"I've been hearing people rave about this place in Cali and couldn't wait for it to open!  Gyu-Kaku welcomes you with a grand entry way lit with lights, it definitely doesn't feel like I'm still in Vegas while walking in.  We were seated right away and our server explained the menu to us and suggested ordering off their course menus ($55-$77).  We opted for a la carte because we thought we'd save more money and be able to eat what we wanted, but our bill came out to $60 anyway.  

We started off with the Asian Sangria in Apple.  It's made with Hana Sake, fruits, mandarin, orange, mint and sprite.  The sangria was fruity, refreshing, and delicious!  If you're looking for something to sip on that doesn't burn your throat, this is the winner! 

Spicy Tuna Volcano: a block of rice that's fried with spicy tuna on top.  Although it's a best seller, I wouldn't order it again.  The rice was too fried and hard to chew. I've seen it executed better at ayce sushi.

Our server recommended 2 plates of meat and 2 plates of vegetables per person and an appetizer to be full.  I initially thought it was a lot of food, but I didn't realize how small the portions would be.  

We ordered the Bistro Hanger Steak, Duck, and Angus Beef Ribs with the sauces that were recommended for each on the menu.  When we got our meats, I couldn't believe how fresh they looked, each plate came with 5-6 pieces of meat, so don't expect to get ayce full. It's more about the quality than quantity here.  I also enjoyed the 3 different sauces on the table that you could dip your meats in!  They also have additional sauces you can pay for to enhance the flavor of the meats, we decided to go with the Crunchy Garlic Sauce.  It's crunchy garlic in red chili oil, but with all the sauces at the table, I didn't find it necessary.  Everything had so much flavor already so no need to pay extra.  

For vegetables, we got the Mushroom Medley, which came with Enoki, King Oyster, and Garlic Mushroom and Spinach Garlic.  Both were good additions to the meat.  They come in foil and you steam it on your grill alongside with the meat.  
 
Rice isn't included in a la carte, so we ordered 2 bowls at $1.95 each.  

I love how you don't smell like bbq afterwards and the service is beyond amazing!  I'll definitely be back to try their course menu and their HH menu which is from 5-6 pm and 10 pm-12 am.  Just be mindful that you're gonna have to pay a little more than you're used to, to get full."}
{"text":"First time and it was a good experience. We got the $55 meat lovers course which is for 2 people and were excited to have their s'mores for dessert, but before we ordered it, they told us they ran out. Instead they gave ONE mochi ice cream and cut it in half. I think we should have at least got one each. 

Would have been 5 stars but they ran out of s'mores."}
{"text":"We were thoroughly impressed with our visit to Gyu Kaku. The dinning section was very clean with a traditional Japanese décor. The large bar area looked well stocked and very modern with several flat screen TVs showing a variety of sports. It looks like they also have several large private rooms for parties or business meeting too.

I'm a meat eater and ordered several dishes including: Harami, Toro Beef, Bistro Hanger Steak, & Filet Mignon. My wife had the chicken and several vegetable dishes including her favorite, garlic beans. Everything we ordered tasted great! I love the fact that we were able to physically control how well done we want our food cooked. 

The staff was very friendly and attentive. The prices were all very reasonable, especially considering the upscale vibe to the place and the novelty of getting to grill your own food right at the table.

Hands down this was the best Japanese BBQ restaurant that we've been to anywhere. It's our new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"The food was very nicely presented and was seasoned well! The employees were very nice and checked with us often. They also changed our grill when it was dirty. We ordered Meat Lover and Surf Turf courses! Finished with S'mores at the end which was fun!"}
{"text":"We got there at around 5.30pm on a Sunday without a reservation and were seated right away. 

Our favourite was the Kobe Style Kalbi Short Rib and everything we tried was good. The food came pretty fast. All the meat pieces were placed neatly on the plates and the waiter told us what each type of meat was and how long to grill for. 

They don't have a lot of vegetable choices on the menu but it's definitely a heaven for meat lovers. 

The bill came to $125 for the two of us. A bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Hubby and I sneaked out for Japanese tonight while the kids are at soccer practice. We were actually on our way to another Japanese restaurant when my husband spied this new place. We felt under dressed when we walked in. I was reassured once I noticed everyone there with the exception of hubby was Asian. The selection of meats was great. We ordered a couple of different meats and they were delicious. We also ordered seaweed, spinach and tuna poke, all delicious. Kimchee was ok but not spicy enough. Their spicy sauce also wasn't spicy enough but I didn't order any of their special sauces. Service was excellent and I enjoyed their drink specials. I really needed the staff's cooking advice and followed their directions exactly. I definitely will go back and next time we'll bring the kids."}
{"text":"Presently surprised with this joint, meat selection was solid and all cuts were very fresh and succulent.  Recommend doing the meals as they are enough for two.  Staff was very nice and attentive, no issues cooking the meat at all either.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Order one of the meals. It came with lots of food and a lot of variety of the menu.  The meat and sukiyaki bowl were delicious.  They also usually have drink specials.  Try to make a reservation if possible since they are quite busy."}
{"text":"I went here for Sunday lunch; finding parking around here is really hard, but I luckily found a place. Unluckily, I ended up getting a ticket.

Regardless, the food at Gyu-Kaku is quite good! They have three price levels; they have Super Happy Hour (their lowest price level) from 2pm to 5pm on Monday to Friday. They also have Happy Hour (which I was there for, but not too sure when it is). The prices were reasonable for what it is.

The items below were through doing the a-la-carte menu.

Gyoza - this was moderate in value, you get 4 and they were OK gyoza. Fairly crispy though if you're into that!

Broccoli - they give you broccoli in a bag and get you to heat it up for a while; this way just normal broccoli and it was tasty; but again, it's just broccoli that you can get from the stores.

New York Steak - this was actually good - I think this meat tastes quite good when cooked to medium rare; this is probably one of the easiest ones to cook. My only concern was that because I didn't know how the meat was prepared, etc. I wasn't too comfortable going rare (which is what I prefer in general).

Kalbi Chuck Rib - this was very tender and was tasty, it was enjoyable!

Yaki-Shabu Beef - despite what the menu says about this cooking quickly; this absolutely does not. However, this thinly sliced beef was really tasty with the sweet dipping sauce they provided.

Toro Beef - by far my favourite; this was quick to cook and really tasty. I loved the fattiness and how I could dip it into any of the sauces, and it came out great. It is also great value for money.

Duck Breast - this duck breast was OK. I'm not too sure about this because it took quite a while to cook and was not very flavourful.

Spicy Pork - this probably isn't the Gyu-Kaku's fault, but I'm not a big fan of this dish in general given the high amount of sauce already on the pork."}
{"text":"Been wanting to visit since they opened. I finally went last month during lunch with several coworkers. I ordered the garlic noodle lunch special which comes with a salad and soup (had the miso) and added shrimp for $1. 

The salad and miso soup were fine. The garlic noodle looked promising but in the end it lacked flavor. It was presented nicely with a sizzling stone pot, but the noodles were over cooked and needed more garlic flavor. Luckily they have a variety of sauces for the bbq and I used some to salvage the noodles. 

All in all it was fine. Step above food court but not worth the hype. Will need to return for the bbq lunch set. Reservations are available online via OpenTable."}
{"text":"Came here on a cold night with some coworkers. This place is awesome! I know we have one in Houston but I was in Calgary for work for a week. Definitely skip the other meats and order the #1 meat plate! Pricey but its a nice little spot."}
{"text":"I came with a large group and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The dinner group sets have a good amount of food and you can always supplement with some extra sides. I enjoyed the different types of meat complimented with the three different sauces available. Service was good as the waiter consistently changed the grill and checked to see if we got all the items in our set dinner. An added bonus was that it was a friend's birthday, there was complimentary ice cream dessert and birthday song. The green tea ice cream was very good and wasn't your average fake green tea taste. Overall, will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good cuts of meat here. Really enjoyed the Kalbi here.  Service is quite good at least when we went. Place is clean and tidy so I'm okay with it."}
{"text":"Go, go, go! The service is great! No complaints at all. Been here a handful of times and I'm definitely going again because of the way we are treated there. The waitressing staff are there to make sure you know how to cook your meats on a timely manner on the grill. I can't agree with the mushroom medley, or the corn, it's in a tinfoil sack and you must cook it like that! It's a bit awkward like so, wouldn't mind if they made the mushroom and corn ready to eat in the main kitchen instead, but I can't complain about it, it's their way of doing things and I've ordered it as a part of the package in all times I've gone.  I believe it's the owner or floor manager that always comes around and makes sure we are taken care of, he's wasting his time, we are doing great because of the staff!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in all of Chinatown. The food is amazing for its price, service is always excellent, and the atmosphere is nice as well. I have a reoccurring problem with the hostesses though. There were numerous times I enter this establishment and there's no hostess up front. There was a time I waited a few minutes and even stood in the dining area and no one noticed me.  Other than the hostesses, I absolutely love this place"}
{"text":"I always liked Gyu-Kaku. I have been to the one in Vancouver many times and decided to come here for lunch. They have two kind of lunch specials here. One is called the Calgary Lunch Special for $12.95 you get to pick two items to BBQ or 3 items for $15.95. The Calgary lunch special comes with miso soup, salad and rice. Or you can get the Non-Grill Lunch set for 1 person. They have various options for $9.95 Bowl/ bibimbap set (comes with soup and salad). The Non-grill lunch set is also available in Vancouver so guessing that is why its not called \"Calgary special\" or \"Calgary Non-Grill Lunch set\"

I got the beef Sukiyaki bibimbap set. I was served on a stone bowl and was nice and hot all the way through. The staff would mix the bibimbap for you. I have to say I loved it. It was very delicious. But again Gyu-Kaku never fails me. 

Décor was nice and clean. The place can get pretty hot here because you have the BBQ grill in front of you. Also the place isn't big so you must make a reservation. 

I highly recommend coming here during lunch time."}
{"text":"Been to Guy Kaku all over California and the Vegas Venue definitely lives up to the reputation of its sister venues in california. My friends and I have been here three times this week, and every time the food has been great. Karsten and staff have provided top notch service, the grills are constantly being swapped out for fresh ones and the staff is always accommodating.

The food is presented raw and cooked at the table. They have 3 types of soy; spicy, ponzu, and spicy. All of which are delicious. My favorites include the spicy cabbage salad(amazing.. Trust me! We go through several orders), pork belly, and Angus beef ribs. They happy hour all day Monday and late night happy hour every other day. Can't beat it."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service! Henson was our server and he was great as well as rest of the staff. Been coming here since it opened and it just gets better everytime especially with happy hour all day Monday and Wednesday. Best Japanese BBQ in Vegas hands down!"}
{"text":"The evening started off a little bumpy here but ended off smooth sailing. 

After waiting about 20 min for our waitress to come and take our order (an issue which the manager immediately addressed), our food came out very shortly after. We ordered the set dinner for four with some additions including another bibimbap. The bibimbap wasn't anything like the Korean ones but wasn't horrible. The grilled food was seasoned well and beef was delicious when cooked. The best part about this place is their actual grill. The ventilation is built into the rim of the recessed grill making it pleasant to cook the food without smoke blowing into everyone's face. 

Our server was also fantastic - knowledgeable and friendly. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! In my opinion, it is WAY better than any Korean BBQ I have ever had. The servings are quite small but very worth the price, and they get you full quickly. I highly recommend the angus beef -- it's super fatty and flavorful! Everything is delicious and all the sauces provided are great. I would come here all the time if I lived in Vegas. Also, our waiter Yoshi was very friendly and constantly smiling. One of the best waiters I've ever met! Japanese BBQ is now one of my favorite types of cuisine. Bonus: you don't smell of BBQ and smoke after leaving (unlike with KBBQ)! Wonderful food, wonderful service, wonderful restaurant. 5/5!"}
{"text":"I came here to meet up with some girlfriends after work since they had all day happy hour on Wednesday. It's very centrally located in the valley so great for meeting up. You definitely cannot beat the prices. Martinis for $4, large sake for $6 and tons of food options. It also was very easy to schedule a reservation even for 6 of us. 

The only reason I didn't give this place a 5 star would be the slow service. This could be partially our fault since we were cooking the meat but the whole meal took about three hours to completely finish. I don't recommend coming here on a time crunch.

Overall it was very good and I'd definitely be back again for another happy hour."}
{"text":"This is the best Japanese barbeque i'ved ever taste!!!! Great customer service, nice ambiance , great food!!! Highly recommended and definitely will come back"}
{"text":"Always love coming here and it takes me about 25 minutes but it's well worth it. The service is always top notch and the food is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Wish that for parties of 6 they had two burners to cook the food as it can make it difficult to all eat at the same time."}
{"text":"This is a pretty hip and cool restaurant. Even when you drive by, the place is full of lights with an awesome decor. 
They have your regular Korean BBQ but with a face lift. The grill is a bit smaller but looks a lot fancier. The meat sizes are also smaller than your traditional Korean BBQ, but with good flavor. So why is this place better? The atmosphere is awesome. This is a great place to come with a large group of people and have a great time.  They play loud top hits music and have reasonable priced drinks! They also offer happy hour pricing everyday from 5 PM to 630 PM... 
What I loved the most was the s'mores experience..... I know, I know a bit silly but it really took me back to my camping fun times... How many times can u make ur own s'mores!!! Either way, awesome, totally recommendable restaurant! 
Must try: mushrooms and the Harami Skirt Steak."}
{"text":"I've been to the one in Hawaii many times so I had an idea of what to expect. Ended up going here on a whim with my boyfriend since they were open late. To our surprise we went during happy hour which was a plus. Our server's name was Andrew and he was on point with his customer service; very nice and down to earth. My boyfriend and I had the meat lovers meal for two. It was definitely filling. We will be coming back again! Great service and great food, who's complaining? Not us!"}
{"text":"Excellent time with my first timer friends! We enjoyed cooking together. Great food and service. Nice price and great happy hour too. Our server Mieko was amazing. Thank you to manager Chris. You made our night so special. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The meat quality here is great! However the marinated meat choices are way too sweet. I try sticking to plain ones so I can just dip them in the sauces myself. 

The service here is always great. When there's a rush, servers always 
apologize for the delays and hold up a conversation. Totally understandable.

Asian sangria is also my fav here. I have yet to try the reef with calpico.

The smores at the end of the meal is always pleasant but I feel like the main reason I come to gyu kaku is for the lady m crepe haha"}
{"text":"They were short on staff when we visited. But staffs were friendly even though service took longer. Food was great. Cool looking samurai armor at the front. Don't know if its real or not. Anyway, will definitely come back when we get the cravings again."}
{"text":"It was a weekday night and it was packed, lucky got an reservation so we didn't need to wait. The restaurant look Nice and the staff was friendy and introduce the menu to us. Shortly after we ordered the food came pretty quick(cuz they are raw and you need to cook your own food). The food quality was good and seasoning well. All the items is not more than $10 so it worth the money compare with the food quality. Since every dish is only cost you few  dollars so beware of over order in terms of your budget."}
{"text":"Food was super good! My new favorite spot. 
All the staff were so friendly and helped each other out. We always got checked on, and our grill was constantly being changed.  Water was never empty and our server was so informative and sweet. 

Get the meat lover! It's definitely enough for 2 people and you get s'mores! ... S' MORES!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a very chill and ambient place for Japanese yakiniku. It is not AYCE but the meat is great quality and the prices are pretty reasonable. 

My friend and I ordered 4 different meats and an appetizer split between 2 people and I was stuffed!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten so many Yakiniku in my life in Japan, because we love Yakiniku!! Gyu-Kaku is reasonable yakiniku place and a price that is appropriate for the quality of a good. 
And Mr.Yoshi is great waiter. Actually I was impressed with their wonderful service and seeing all staff working with a smile.
Their Bestseller's \"Harami Miso Skirt Steak\" isn't good actually. I love Harami, but I don't order it here.\"Kalbi Short-Rib\" is delisious and \"Beef Tongue with Scallion Sauce\" is great.And I like \"Yaki-Shabu\" also. I think that they make an effort very much, but Gyu-Kaku company should be able to obtain higher quality meat."}
{"text":"A group of us (7 people) came here during the week for lunch. We called and made reservations ahead of time. The phone line was very tough to get through, fyi.

Upon arrival, we were seated at a table with only 1 grill. I thought that was bizzare, or people don't usually order off the BBQ menu for lunch. Later, we learned that there were only limited amount of tables with 2 grills, and they were all taken. We all ordered the lunch special where you get 2 or 3 plates of choice of dish where you grill, and it comes with rice and miso soup. We waited for a good 15+minutes for the plates to start arriving, and by the time they did, our server messed up our order and had to re-confirm everyone's choice twice. So the second round of waiting for our food began..

It was pathetic for the 7 of us to use 1 grill, we had to take turns and wait for each other. I would have appreciated it a lot more if they asked if we wanted to split into two tables instead.

Service on the other hand (besides getting our order mixed up) was good, they manager(?) checked up on us frequently and ensured that we were getting what we wanted. Food wasn't bad, you can definitely expect the quality to be signifcantly better than your regular AYCE Korean BBQ. 

I simply thought they could at least try to speed things up for us, seeing that we were dressed in business attire, and maybe we could not afford taking a 2.5h lunch break."}
{"text":"Went to gyu kaku twice in one week !! It's a Japanese BBQ joint, but they also have ramen , noodle dishes, apps , etc . Both times I went were at lunch .. And also happy hour ! I've tried their deep fried bacon, cheesy wonton things, noodles and their lunch special . I guess you can say it's expensive, but worth the money . It was  delicious . Their meat has a lot of flavor. The cooking does take some time tho, depending on what you get .. Like the fish products (salmon, miso butter fish) . So order those if you have patience !!"}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant a few times now. It's a much nicer Asian BBQ restaurant than others. Their staff is quite knowledgable and good with suggestions for first timers. The meat quality is great. If you're getting the sharing/group menu, they give you a lot of food. Their happy hour is a pretty sweet deal! I recommend making reservations as they do get very busy."}
{"text":"Alrighty, I've been here 3 times, and all have been consistent, which is a good sign! 

First time on my birthday 11/19: got the premium HH $55 Special which came with harami skirt, filet mignon, shrimp, pork belly, short rib and chicken. Of course it came with the app of soup, salad, edamame, and a few others as well like tofu nugget, gyoza, and an unknown lol. Top favorite were the skirt, filet and chicken. Service was good, the server at the time was starting his first day but did very well. 

Second time was Friday night 1/22: came in with mom, this time got the same special, adding in beef tacos, cheese wonton, sweet potato fries. Before we could taste any of it my mom felt ill and wanted to go home, so I asked for my check and paid the bill and unfortunately had to cancel the meal. Tim the manager immediately responded with helping me out the next time we come in which lead to tonight. 

Monday 1/25: Pretty busy for a Monday night, had to get a reservation first, spoke to Tim the manager and immediately helped us right away and got to continue with our last server, which was Steven, super cool dude! We ordered everything from last time that we didn't get to enjoy and got to taste everything and it was great! Service was excellent and frequent, food was cooked to right temperatures (appetizers). Total check was $88.00 with the extra filet mignon I ordered with drinks and tipped $25.00. Couldn't help but was impressed with the hospitality from this joint, thank you Tim and Steven for making a great experience!

Will come back for my fix again soon!"}
{"text":"Food is overall ok, but I don't really like the meet with prepared source, they kind of taste all the same...

The meat quality is better than all you can eat bbq through, highly recommend their fried chicken.

Very nice service, change the baking tray once, but as my previous experience eating Korean bbq, the tray should be changed at least three or four times, or the flavor of meet would be affected.

Beef tongue highly recommended.

And one big disadvantage is that the smoked air inside room which just have no where to go but getting into people's nose, they should really improve that."}
{"text":"I cant even tell you how amazing our experience has been here...
BUT ...I will try my best, lol.
Came in not really knowing what to expect. Didn't read about this place and wasn't even that hungry....but...
We ended up ordering a bunch of appetizers and also tried the Sukiyaki Bibimbap (let it get crispy!!)
Ordered drinks and a pitcher of beer to go with our food and all was reasonably priced on their happy hour menu. 
Victoria was our server, and was so attentive and patient and offered helpful suggestions. Make sure to ask knowing we were first timers here. 
This is definitely a new favorite spot!!!"}
{"text":"Hostess were two young asian girls whom both gave excellent customer service. Bartender Bella is amazing. Managers (at the time dined in) were very genuine about customer satisfaction, and you could clearly see they cared about this establishment. They talked to each table and spent time to actually have a conversation weather that be in relation to the restaurant or of just random topics, they made everyone laugh and assured no one left disappointed- Even the staff seemed to be happy with Managers who were(at the time): Karsten, and Shayna-Marie. Servers were quick with refills, knowledgable with menu, and did not wait long to have our food out and even explained proper cook times as well as sanitation advice. 

Great food should you choose the right marinade for your meat, along with the right choice of appetizers/sides ect. togo with it. 

Try getting a few Sake Bombs with you and your date/or group of friends when Bella is tending the Bar- She'll make it one to remember !!!!!

All though this is a good review, don't think I will be returning based off of a few things I have seen and heard of about this place. I mean, looks can be appealing to the naked eye, but what goes on behind those curtains/doors(at any establishment) we will never know...unless we have be an employee there... Bottom line is simply this- It looks so fancy and high class from the moment you step into that beautiful glass door and vintage wood door entrance, but don't let that fool you... You just never know. But I do...... And I will leave this review at that -"}
{"text":"Definitely recommend!  Food was really good and service was superb!  We ordered the set for four and added a few items.  My favorite was the cow tongue and kalbi!"}
{"text":"Great lunch and happy hour specials.  I ordered the lunch special that comes salad, rice and miso soup with your choice of 2 or 3 kinds of BBQ meat for $13.95 and $16.95 respectively. I also added $2 for the broccoli.  I got the miso hanger steak and filet mignon.  Both were delicious and went really well with the rice.  Service was prompt and good.  Download the guy-kaku app for discounts and freebies!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with a couple friends and out expectations were highly exceeded. Out server, Ryan knew just what we wanted. We didn't have to order a single thing after drinks it was just there, ready to go once we were. One of the best servers I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. Prompt, friendly, interactive, funny. Plus the food was phenomenal. This is hands down my new favorite spot. And you'll find us in Ryans section every single time!"}
{"text":"You would not be disappointed with their BBQ. Clean dinning space. Fast service and decent prices. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Seriously amazing food and service! We had the ultimate all you can eat and it comes with unlimited free macarons for dessert.. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in town. I take all of my friends from out if town here. They have amazing happy hour cocktails and food. Download their app to receive an amazing discount."}
{"text":"First time to try Japanese grill food and it was a great experience.  Beef, chicken, shrimp plates are well proportioned.  Beef marinates tho has too much sugar in it but is still good.  Andrew catered to our needs and is excellent.  Will come back for sure.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We used to eat here ALL THE TIME! But that was before they started playing offensive rap music. I will not take my family to any establishment that plays music where every other word is n*gger. Seriously who allows this?!??"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Gyu-Kaku for a year now, they have always been awesome and the food has been delicious. Tonight, we experienced a grill that didn't work, but our server Jamie made up for it. She was more that accommodating and really turned out sour experience into a pleasant one. We will be back, but we hope our experience was a lot more pleasant next time than tonight."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant , where you can cook meats and different dishes in the middle of your table they always have a happy hour going on ! Lots of giveaways and stuff for regular returning customers ! The sauces are amazing !"}
{"text":"Gyu kaku is a chain restaurant that specializes in Japanese BBQ where you grill your own meats tableside. There are a variety of delicious meats and sides to choose from a la carte, or you can order a dinner set which is slightly cheaper. 

For starters I ordered the fried bacon chips, good but a bit salty. I also ordered garlic bimbimbap to share. It was so delicious that we had to order another one. For the side veggies, broccoli and mushroom medley which are served with butter wrapped in tin foil to grill. The kimchee was pretty standard. 

For the meat selections, I ordered the Japanese sausages served with whole grain mustard for dipping which were pretty good. Also Kalbi short ribs, filet mignon, yaki-shabu and the spicy pork were delicious. The garlic shrimp was way too salty, too much garlic salt! There are also 3 different dipping sauces for your meat to choose from - sweet soy, ponzu and spicy. 

The restaurant has an app for you to earn points from your bill so that you can redeem them for entrees in the future. We had a great dining experience here and will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I wish they still had their AYC Drink special for $25 because that was amazing! They do have happy hour, which seems to be all the time. It's more like happy day.

I wouldn't go here to eat because their proportions are small, but if you mainly want to get drinks, this is your place to go to. Their \"Coral Reef\" is one of the best cocktails I ever had."}
{"text":"When we landed, I wanted to come here.
Service is excellent, restaurant is clean.
They have quality meat. We ordered the all you can eat at 42 pp
Unlimited ribeye, miso skirt, bbq flank, filet mignon, chili dumplings, salad, unlimited grilled.prawns. we ended with.smores.
The.place is clean abd the food quality is impeccable. Come to this place"}
{"text":"I've been to the other Gyu Kaku locations in Cali: LA, SD, HB, and Tustin and I must say... This location is my favorite so far! What I like about it is that there's a full bar so if there's a wait you can always head there and you can even order appetizers! That makes the wait go by way faster. I've never had an issue with wait time at this location though compared to the ones in Cali. Maybe because it is a lot bigger as well. Servers were very friendly and attentive. This is a Japanese BBQ and most of the items you will be grilling on your own and there's also appetizers and noodle and rice dishes that come from the kitchen. My favorite dishes from here are beef sukiyaki, garlic noodles, spicy tuna volcano with avocado, beef tongue, prime kalbi, filet mignon, garlic shrimp, broccoli with cheese, and mushroom medley. I hear their bacon chips are amazingg but I have yet to give that a try. Besides from Gangnam, this is my go to place for a NON-ayce bbq spot."}
{"text":"Gyu Kaku is a Japanese barbecue joint that resembles a Korean bbq experience. Basically, you order meats, grill them and eat it with the sides. 

We ordered the meat lover's course. Despite being famished, I did not think that the appetizer is outstanding. It had a crispy batter on the outside, but unremarkable flavors. We tried the filet mignon and yaki shabu. Both had tremendous flavors that we liked! For dessert, we had s'mores. They couldnt possibly mess up the packed graham crackers, hershey's milk chocolate and store-bought marshmallows, the cool thing though was toasting them in the restaurant! 
Our server was very friendly and attentive. 

Overall, Gyu Kaku is a great addition to our city!"}
{"text":"Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ is a great place to eat, and can even accommodate large groups! The meat is thicccc-ker  than your usual skinny brisket from a kbbq place. 

The food is great, and our server was very nice as well. It is great for a date or even bringing a group of friends or family. It cost around $30 for AYCE on a Sunday. There is another option that costs more, but you also get more selection of meats. Great place!"}
{"text":"Open late and got good grub! We did a dinner for 4 but only 3 of us are. Good meat cuts and there's smores  for dessert. Awesome decor and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Awesome Happy Hour specials!!! Make sure you come hungry!!! We got soup, salad, assorted appetizers, rice and lots of meat and a shrimp dish, and s'mores for 2 for $55!!! 

It was all delicious and fun as we got to cook it ourselves w/o all the prep and cleanup!!! Henson was our server and he was excellent!!! He kept our drinks filled and brought everything out in a timely manner!!!! Next time we go, we'll be sure to try the Happy Hour drink specials, they look yummy!!! 

Would definitely recommend to anyone that wants a nice, leisurely lunch/dinner!!!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend. We got the Meat Lovers for 2 which was a ton of food for the price. The service was great all night from the moment we walked in. The salad was yummy, the fried chicken bites were delicious, the meat was tender and fun to cook. We had an all round great night and actually ended up being too full for the ice cream at the end!"}
{"text":"Our time here would have been enjoyable except for the fact that we had made reservations and were asked to leave and rushed out the restaurant after our last dish was served because they had a reservation soon for the table. We were handed the bill which we hadn't requested for as we were planning on ordering another dessert and the bill was about $200 for four people and were shocked and disappointed that there was no forewarning when we were seated that there was a tight reservation schedule.  We werent even there for super long considering our reservations was at 5:45pm and was asked to leave at 7:30.  I think it's fair to assume two hours to give diners to eat is reasonable especially since the style of food here was self barbeque.  We got a set dinner menu and food was good, nothing outstanding but being asked to leave just ruined the whole experience."}
{"text":"I was treated to this place by my lovely sister. Once walking through the door and seated, you are greeted by all the workers in Japanese. This I feel is very welcoming and gave me that Japanese feel. 

The set up, decorations and style was really eye catching as well. The entrance is lit up by rows of lights and the inside reflects how restaurants in Japan are set up like. This definitely is a great place to socialize, cook and eat at the same time. 

It did take a little long for someone to come start serving us but it could have been due to how busy they were that night. The servers were friendly and educated us about each meat and entree, they were also very polite. 

We ordered 2 courses, since we had a party for 4. One being the Surf Turf Jackpot Course and the Meat Lover's Course. There is a variety of meat that is included. (Filet mignon, Kobe style flat iron steak) and seafood as well (shrimp, salmon). We were able to cook these the way we like it! 

The only reason I didn't give this place a 5 star is because (1) it did take us awhile to get served and there was no inform of sympathy. (2) it was my brother and I birthday, and we were given one birthday hat but no singing ceremony like the others and (3) our check $50 extra due to charging of every single appetizer item when it was suppose to be included in the courses. Luckily we caught that and got that fixed. 

However if you're looking to drink, eat and socialize. This is a nice place to do all the above. Something about taking and cooking for everyone just gives me that family feel."}
{"text":"Amazing the best chain restaurant I've ever been to. I have been in Montreal for a week and this is by far the best. Great music, servers, and food def recommend"}
{"text":"Great service, great food! Happy hour prices are awesome (available all day Monday)! I recommend doing the yakiniku. Cheap prices for small portions let you try lots of different things."}
{"text":"We ordered the premium meat lover course, premium beef tough and miso beef.  I really love the place and everything tastes good but it is hard to make a reservation. The waiters are always busy and it takes a well to get what you want."}
{"text":"Such a fun place for a date night! It got hot cooking your own food (and it was like 112 outside) but still fun! We did the special for 2 and happy hour pitchers of Sapporo were an awesome deal! It didn't seem like a lot of food, but we left satisfied. We will def be back again."}
{"text":"Very nice place!!!! So delicious!!! And the service is fantastic, thank you Lin you make our stay unforgettable!!!"}
{"text":"Has us wait for 35 mins when the table we got was open the entire time! Had a party of 8 and there's still a table bigger than what we got. Waited for nothing. Horrible hostess."}
{"text":"I can understand why this place is so highly reviewed. It definitely held up to its name. 

Service: 5/5 shout out to Andrew who is a wonderful server. The hostess was very nice as well. Andrew checked in with us enough, but not too much to the point where we got annoyed.

Food: 5/5

What we ordered (happy hour prices):
Angus beef ribs: $3.95 our favorite item
Spicy tuna volcano: $5.95 (i've had better at Tao, etc. not bad though)
Harami skirt steak: $8.95 very good
Kalbi short rib: $8.95 very good
Broccoli cheese fondue: $3.95 our favorite vegetable item
Wakame seaweed salad: $2.95 standard seaweed salad
Garlic fried chicken: $4.50 could have done without

Great experience, will be back soon. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've dined here twice and I love it! The service is great Everyone is friendly and attentive our server checked on us plenty of times. They have a really good late night happy hour at 10pm and a super happy hour at 11 which is even better. I love cooking the food myself on the little grill in the middle of the table. The food is so good and really cheap! They also have great cocktails. It's located right in the middle of China town. You should definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"This is the third time I've been to Gyu-Kaku on crescent and every time has been a great experience! The prices are very reasonable and the quality of the meat is pretty good for what you pay for. I strongly recommend the beef sukiyaki bibimbap and to let the rice sizzle on the hot stone bowl for a couple of minutes after the staff mixes it in front of you for that delicious caramelized rice taste. 

They also have a couple of preset course menus that are a pretty good deal. However, I do not recommend the tuna volcano sushi nor the Gyu-kaku salad, both of which were disappointing, the rice being too hard for the sushi, and the salad dressing watery and unflavourful. I suggest to stick to the bibimbap and grill items for a fool-proof meal and amazing. 

The staff is very courteous and helpful, regularly picking up the empty plates and changing the grill. This place is great for a small group of friends! And did I mention the happy hour? The prices of many item on the list drop! 

I'm already looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Be sure to make a reservation. 
We were here when they were soft launching. We ordered BBQ items only, several meats and veggi, but no starters. I like all of my orders, beef bistro 9$, Kobe New York style 30$, premium beef tongue with scallion sauce 14$, duck breast, pork belly and shishito pepper and asparagus. My husband and I both love the beef tongue the best and Kobe New York the lest. The beef tongue wrapping the scallion is a must try, so tender and juicy, and the sauce went well with all meat items. The scallion sauce is very salty so mind the amount wrapped in the meat. The Kobe style New York we got was not the same as shown on the menu and the taste was a bit disappointing considering the price. There are many other water mouthing choices to try. Later I found its not real Kobe beef only Kobe style. So misleading when someone can read their Japanese label ??.
The service was great. All staff are very knowledgeable to the dishes so they can give you suggestions about the grill timing. They checked on us more than regularly and offered to change to a fresh grill. After changing a grill, be sure to wait long enough to heat the new grill so that the raw meat wont stick on it. Our waiter Vincent paid attention to the grill temperature to make sure it's the best one for the certain meat. Our waiter always half squatted to talk to us, very considerate. 
After the soft launch they will offer happy hour special prices for many dishes. We will definitely to come back and try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"First impression. Super awesome bright entrance! 

We walk in....pretty setting. Totally wanted to eat on the floor tables. 

We get a booth and we were game. I was looking forward to coming here, but after I tried getting a few people's attention and them just looking away acting like I don't exist, i got a bit annoyed. I get it, our table isn't there's, but when my hands in your face and I say excuse me, at least acknowledge it. It took a good 15-20 mins for someone to ask if we've been helped. It just sucks it took someone to wail there hands around like those blow up guys in front of car dealerships to get their attention.

We got Andrew, and he was phenomenal. Great customer service. He told us what the menus about, but since we waited so long, we already knew what we wanted. Get a la carte! No point on getting the combo. Too expensive, and you might not get everything you may want to try. 

The meat was OK, but not to die for. Small portion for each meat you order. They range from $5-$8. Not unless you get the Kobe, then that's about $20. We also got a couple appetizers. The garlic chicken and the calamari. Again, not to die for. Also, those were the worlds smallest fried calamari I've ever had from any restaurants I've ever been in. 

Crunchy garlic sauce ppl were raging about...ehh. 

The real reason I gave this 3 stars, which I think I'm being generous, is because from the corner of my eye I saw one of the ladies cleaning the table top with a dirty rag. I saw her wipe the grill from underneath and saw just dust and black muck on the rag. She then folds the rag, which is thin, and wipes the tables down with it. Then the booth and chairs. Soooo, ew. At least wipe the table top first, yanno? 

Oh! And that playlist they played, I swear all the songs were from the 90's. They got that DDR music playing and made me wanna play it. Hah! 


I also admit, I kind of miss the goth bar that was there prior to it being gyu kaku. Good times. \"(?´) Though, the renovation is pretty great."}
{"text":"I loved every single thing about Gyu-Kaku. Amazing food, great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and did the meat lovers combo, it's suppose to
Be good for 2 people but I came here with the boyfriend and uncle and we were super full. We truly enjoyed our dinner everything tasted delish..and we didn't come out smelling like bbq. Which is Aweosme CuZ whenever we do Korean BBQ, I swear that smell sticks to your clothes for days. Love the beef selection from the beef tongue to the shabu meat I think that's what they called the thin sliced beef. To the apps and Serts.. Which came with karage and s'mores, I'll definitely come back specially that they have a reverse happy hour."}
{"text":"Friends and I went here for a birthday celebration. We booked ahead of time but waited for 15 minutes or so to be seated. The reservation starts at the time of booking and not when seated.

The server was nice and attentive. 

The restaurant was well ventilated so we didn't smell like grilled food by the end of our dinner.

We ordered the Samurai bbq course ($125 for 4 people). The quality of the meat, produce and seafood was fresh. The meat was very red and looked very juicy. The proportion was great for a group of 4 people with a generous appetite. They don't bring out all the dishes at once. For every dish the server brought out, he explained what it was and how long to cook it.

They replaced the grill often without asking which is rare.

We wanted to stay for a little bit for dessert but could not. They were busy and had the table booked after us. It was disappointing but understandable. I wished the time started at the time we were seated.

I would definitely pay the premium price for better food quality and service (other than waiting for a reserved table)."}
{"text":"Found hair in my food and server takes it away and never returns.  Food is ok, but save your money and get far better quality at a Korean or Japanese ayce buffet.  This place isn't worth it.  The staff needs to learn steps of service and cooks need to wear hairnets!"}
{"text":"Always loved going here! They just added all you can eat in the past few months that is bomb!! Max was our server he was extremely nice and came around at the perfect times :)"}
{"text":"Go during HAPPY HOUR! Imported beer is as cheap as it gets in Vegas - $2.50 for Sapporo, Kirin! Though when I recently went, it seemed like the number of waiters and waitress definitely did not match the number of customers... The waiter was quite busy and running around.

I got the All-You-Can-Eat that included the Kobe Beefs. But keep in mind that the different kinds of Kobe Beef plates, you can only get once. It is a very fun place to eat. Everyone has their own plate, and you grill together. It's a family restaurant I would say, and a great place for date nights.

The dessert - THE ICECREAM MACAROONS - are to die for. A very delightful end of a worthy meal."}
{"text":"i went here for my cousin's birthday & the atmosphere was fun & great! the service was good & the staff were all friendly. they showed us how long to grill the meat for & what the recommended sauces were. they sang happy birthday as well for my cousin & it was super cheerful! she got a free ice cream scoop & a paper hat. it was adorable. 

the only thing i didn't like very much was how the flame is either too high or too low & turns off. it was stressful trying to not burn the food & have a giant flame form but also trying to not undercook it either! 

the meat was very yummy though! meat + the cheese fondue is very yummy!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service. My wife and I really enjoyed the Toronto Gyukaku. Much better ventilated than most yakiniku places in the GTA. Meat was well marinated. Service was excellent though since it's fairly new I'm told by friends who went earlier that they had a less than perfect service experience. However for us it was great. Premium meat set for two was a great amount of food, and much cheaper than any of the US Gyukaku locations I've tried."}
{"text":"I am a regular here and I always enjoy my meal. Drinks are unique and food is always fresh. Service is attentive and pleasant. Easy walk from Queen or King stations. This is a busy place so always reserve."}
{"text":"I like Gyu-Kaku for various reasons.  Sure, it's a chain and all but they have one of the best happy hours ever!

Happy hours - All Day on Mondays and Wednesdays!  That alone makes this a great place to visit! They also have early happy hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays through Sundays from 12 pm to 6:30 pm and late happy hour (reverse happy hour) on Tuesdays and Thursdays through Sundays from 9 pm to 12:30 am.  Even with happy hour, you can still drop a pretty penny because there's a lot to order.  I love their cocktails and the beer is a great price too!

My go to items are (give or take): Edamame (free with FB like), Fried Calamari, Kim-Chee Tofu, Spicy Tuna Volcano, Steamed Chili Dumplings, Fried Bacon Bits, Fried Japanese Tofu, Pork Gyoza Dumplings, Toro Beef, Horumon Intestine, Beef Tongue, Pork Belly, Pork Toro, Shrimp Garlic, and Mushroom Medley.

Their rewards program is pretty awesome!  If I'm not getting free food, I'm getting money off the bill. Who is going to complain about that?

They recently added an all-you-can-eat option: $15-$20/pp children (ages 6-12); $30-$40/pp adults and $20-$27 seniors (age 60 and up). 

This is a fun place for groups, although you can easily run out of space at your table.  I like that they make a big deal out of birthdays!  Love places that put that little effort in!  (Hence, that's why I'm going tonight!)

Service is pretty good for the most part.  You have energetic individuals coming around to get your orders in and food out.  It's a bit frustrating to have reservations every time I go, but still have to wait an additional 10-15 minutes since the table is never ready.  (Not ideal when you have kids in tow.) Surprisingly, I didn't have to wait the last time but I have had to in the past.

But most importantly, the kids enjoy this place and will eat quite a bit while there.  As a result, that makes for two very happy parents."}
{"text":"Happy hour has great deals. The meat marination is delicious. My hubs and I enjoy getting the meal deals for 2. Good amount of meats and nice small serving of appetizers. Their specialty salad is also yummy and Their s'mores tops off the meal."}
{"text":"Gyu-Kaku is an classy Japanese BBQ restaurant with great service, a fantastic happy hour, and mid range prices.  For those of you who have not been to a Japanese BBQ, think of those AYCE Korean BBQ places, but with better cuts of meats that are individually laid out on a tray rather than plopped in a bowl.  

I arrived earlier than my group, so I sat at the bar for a beer.  The happy hour was $2.50 draft beers and I took full advantage of it!  Our group sat at a booth - they've designed the restaurant to maximize booth space, cause you know, no one likes to sit close to a stranger.  They also air vents built right into the grill, so all the smoke gets sucked out before it even floats upwards.  Now, while you won't go home reeking of smoke, you also won't get the delightful smells of BBQ here as well.  

We ordered two of their group sets, which I love.  It takes the work of picking the individual meats and sides out of my hands.  Food just magically appears!

Overall, I highly recommend Gyu-Kaku if you're looking for a nice place to have a BBQ dinner."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I got the Ultimate AYCE deal. Even though it was pricey it had a huge selection and better meats than the premium. Everything was delicious! I usually don't eat rice at AYCE places but their beef sukiyaki bibimbap was so good, especially with the meats. The meat was tender and flavorful. What was even better was the service. RJ was super helpful and friendly. Definitely worth checking out if you visit Vegas. There's great food other then those on the strip."}
{"text":"They started an all you eat, but everyone at your table has to get it or no one can. It is ridiculous my wife only eats one dish not worth  her paying 40 dollars for it. I won't  come back.they are basically saying they dont trust their customers. We used to recommend this place to a lot of people.  We wont be doing that anymore"}
{"text":"Went here alone on a Wednesday night... had no idea how to grill my own food and they helped me out big time. Eggplants legit. Girls next to me ordered ice cream w maple syrup and it sounded bomb too. Spinach is good too. Scallops difficult I burned em but still good. Will go back for a work party potentially."}
{"text":"My server was Jarret and he was pretty slow considering that it was on a slow night especially since I only dined in by my myself. Took 15 minutes to get my spicy ahi tuna pok'e (appetizer) which wasn't a good size portion and took another 20 minutes to get my meats for my grill. I'm disappointed, because I n California the service was much better and faster."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin! The delicious appetizers? The delicious beef? Or the s'mores? Right off the bat I definitely recommend this place. It has a great ambiance and has awesome food. The restaurant is large and seems to be able to accommodate a variety of group sizes. The menu has complete courses, AYCE and a-la-cate options. The quality of the food is great and the fact that I can s'mores at the table is was definitely a great addition to the experience. Definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I got the Premium Meat Lovers set at $75 for 2. 

All the meat was very well marinated and so tasty! Our favourites were the thinly sliced pieces of meat which just melt in your mouth. The steak cubes were good but I probably would not order that next time and opt for a steakhouse for steak cravings.

This set was a good way to get a taste of what Gyu-Kaku offers, but for next time, I think we will be ordering a la carte instead - the Harami miso skirt steak in particular was bomb.

They also have bigger sets for larger groups (3, 4, 6, 8) as well. 

Gyu-Kaku's happy hour specials seem like a great deal but it's only on weekdays around lunch time. (Which might be a great idea if you're on a staycation but not so much on a regular work day as your work clothes will smell like BBQ.)

The tables are booths style - good for date nights or with a group of friends.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Ate here on Sun/5 Apr about 8 pm and on Mon/6 Apr about 11 pm:
- Sunday: At the bar we were the only customers but the bartender was unfriendly and maybe even irritated that she had to serve us.  Once seated at our booth, taitress said it was her second day on the job and she was terrible.  I wasn't able to use my LivingSocial (all I had to do was order 2 more items to reach the $30 spending requirement) voucher but she kept ignoring our table (she would speed past us on her way to/from the kitchen).  I had to flag another waiter to get our water glasses refilled.
- Monday: Andrew was a great waiter.  Finally able to use the LivingSocial voucher and it was happy hour.
- I would only come back if: 1) it was happy hour and 2) I don't have that same first waitress.  
- For now the place gets 1-star as it is pricey bbq (even during happy hour) but will adjust my rating up if future visit(s) are on par with waiter Andrew's service.
- Tip to Management: If your voucher \"excludes Lunch Set Menus\" then Dinner Set Menus are fair game.  If you want to exclude that to, then add \"excludes Dinner Set Menus.\""}
{"text":"Very typical gyu kaku, pretty much to expectations of gyu kakus everywhere.

Salad was presented with more plating than I normally see in US branches and I think meat was sweeter than usual but that was probably just normal variations on day to day basis. That said Gyu-Kaku marinades tend to be in the sweet side to begin with so some of the meat bordered on sickly sweet although not quite there for me. 

Above average rating for above average service.  Waitresses were attentive and friendly although here weren't much to do other than giving us meat and taking care of the check."}
{"text":"Food was great and the staff was awesome. I have to say that this location is better than the Sherman Oaks location due to the bigger venue and shorter wait time... Parking is also better."}
{"text":"My favorite server from swish works here! Always ask for Yoshi.  He makes the experience so much better. Food was super tasty."}
{"text":"I only give it 3stars because we come here quite frequently but today was probably our worse visit ever. From the moment we walked in no one greated us it took about 10 min for someone to recognize us. The young gentlemen said it would be about 10 - 15 min and we told him we were going to wait at the bar. We waited about another 10 min for someone to recognize us. They never came and asked if we have been helped or if we needed anything including the gentlemen that told us our quote time as he walked through the bar. Finally a gentlemen came up to us and asked if we are waiting for a table or a bartender and we responded with both as we were for yoshis section only. He got us sat right away. Once we were sat yoshi made our visit so much better.  After their gm left on pregnancy leave it seems like it has taken a toll. The staff isn't polite or as happy. The bathrooms were disgusting. Great way to start a MERRY Christmas."}
{"text":"We came here with a very large group for a birthday. It was quite the buffet of food. 

It's so hard to NOT get good food in Chinatown. We go down there pretty often now because it really is some of the best food you're going to get in Vegas. 

We got the Gyu-Kaku Course. Good god, it's a lot of food and it's very reasonably priced for 2 people. 

The two best things we had: Kalbi Short Ribs & Filet

It comes with so many things, so prepare to be way too full. 

The only downside as to why I didn't give it 5 stars: we had horrible service. 
They put a guy that was very new on the group. And he was forgetting everything. Everyone kept having to ask him for a lot of the food and drinks over and over. 
He was still really nice--he just seemed super stressed out. Which I can imagine why. They shouldn't have had someone so new helping a large group of people with little to no help. So it took over 3 hours of dining. Which is to be expected with a large group. But fair warning--this may not be a good place to have a very large group for dining. 

Overall, it was delicious and we'll definitely be headed back that way."}
{"text":"5 stars for the service! Our server was Bank and he was on point with every thing.
The food did take a little long to come out and we did have to remind our server. We ordered off the happy hour menu and we had ordered the shio ramen as well. 
The shio ramen was incredibly bland; I used to work in a ramen restaurant for two years and I have been to countless other restaurants that serve ramen but this ramen was by far the worse ramen I've ever had. Save your 7 dollars or so and get some more BBQ that's for sure...

The meat itself for the BBQ was quite delicious. Some pieces of the toro beef were incredibly dry and hard to chew. I'd say try the other meats they offer instead (I can't remember their names right now).

My friend and I had the s'mores for dessert and it was delicious and a great experience.

Our total bill came out to be around 70 dollars for dinner for two hungry girls. Neither one of us had drinks, but we did get ramen along with the BBQ. Overall, too pricey for the experience and food quality. I probably won't be returning to this location, but like I said, the service was 5 stars, everything else wasn't."}
{"text":"Very friendly service.

Food are in the salty side, but the meat quality is good; lunch combo is pretty good deal for downtown location.

I always make online reservation to avoid wait."}
{"text":"Love this place. Amazing atmosphere, fantastic service and a very high quality of food. We ordered the Premium for two and some other odds and ends for three people, and while I'm not stuffed, I'm more than satisfied. 

Honestly can't say what my favourite plate was because it was all incredible. The karaage was definitely at the top of the list though."}
{"text":"Arrived around 4:30pm before the dinner crowd.  Reception was friendly and accommodating.  Our waiter was courteous and informative, with one exception.  Being first timers, it wasn't until 3/4 into our dinner that I discovered  a flame adjustment valve on the side of the table.  He should have informed us at the outset.   As a result, cooking time was little longer than it should have been, and the meat could have been broiled a little better to our liking.  Seasoning and flavor of the meal was excellent."}
{"text":"I honestly don't where the negative reviews are coming from? For me, this Japanese/bbq restaurant is getting 5 stars right across the board. The decor is modern, hip and inviting. The service levels are fast, friendly and efficient, and the food (the meats are fresh lean cuts) is excellent. They also have some incredible lunch specials as well. For under $15 you can have  3 protein choices for the bbq, and soup, salad, and rice. I would describe this place as Japanese, with a Korean infusion. The barbecues at the tables are very clean and modern, and the restaurant itself is very clean. I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place..been coming here for about a year & love the happy hour with bartender Linda/Laura (She uses both names)..she's awesome & is the reason we visit all the way from Texas! Love the dumplings, spicy volcanos, edemames, & Sake!!!"}
{"text":"every bite of food was good...although the fish dishes i could do without 
all the varieties of beef and shrimp and the bibimbap!!! 
DONT FORGET TO ORDER THE CRUNCHY GARLIC SAUCE"}
{"text":"One of fave places! Mondays are lit! Cuatomer seevices isn't great but I love the place anyways"}
{"text":"I have been to the gyu kaku in Orange County many times and it is honestly my favorite restaurant to date. Staying in Vegas with my girlfriends family I heard one opened here I was super excited until I witnessed the horror. The restaurant was nice but other than that who ever is running the place has no idea what they are doing. The service was utterly awful when we got served our water they said our water would be right with us. Yea right that never happened also the water we were served was the most disgusting water I have ever been served this is toilet water I am not kidding. It was so bad I was hesitant about the meat quality which was also not on par with Orange County Gyu Kaku. This place was the most disappointing part of the trip."}
{"text":"It's delicious ! Yum..... Just a reminder small portions. Great happy hour on Mondays. But you get what you pay for in this place, the food in great and service is awesome. Manager is hands on with customers on checking if everything is okay and also helps out with clearing table if need to. Desserts are also good and a must try. They also tell  you the best cooking time if you are grilling for every entree you decide to grill so you don't over cook nor undercook your food. All good for me, I will come back to eat at this place again for sure :)"}
{"text":"My buddy and I checked it out since she had a LivingSocial voucher and I will say this, I would have been offended at how much it was if we did not use the discount.  We ordered five meats, chicken karaage, gyu salad, shrimp bibimbap with onion as the veggie and some calamari for about $50.  They served our salad after we got everything else.  

Only consolation was their spicy sauces were amazing"}
{"text":"I have never been here before. It was suggested by a friend the three is us have a fun dinner together on a Saturday night. 

At first I was a little unclear on how to order, but the waiter cleared it up for us. They have cooked food and food you grill yourself.

I ordered the filet mignon to grill. All of us ordered something from the menu that was cooked and that we had to grill ourselves. 

Inside is very trendy. In today's world with people on cell phones 24/7, it was great to be at a restaurant where you couldn't be on the phone because you had to cook your own food! Lol. None of us were on the phone (except to take some photos) and had fun-n-silly conversations. 

I had a great time."}
{"text":"Had a amazing dinner at Gyu Kaku!!
Their meat are very well marinated, very tasty and they offer great variety of foods!

Different types of beef, pork, chicken, seafood and veggies. This is not an AYCE BBQ so the quality is great! All very tasty especially when you combine with their home made sauce. 

Service wise... Ummmm it is still fairly new, they seems a bit messy at times... And they will not give you a table until all the attendees arrives even if you made a reservation. I just hope they can get better with times.

Price wise, it's more than fair in my opinion. They have different combos for you choose and their combo usually includes plenty of appetizers and desserts.

I strongly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Went for the opening and loved it! They have a menu that's fits everyone's needs. Great price, nice place and amazing food. It's not all you can eat."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of BBQ places before and typically they're your usual in and out, stuff your face and leave type of experiences, but gyu Kaku changed the game last night. John, Jamie, and Henson were handling our group, and took care of us beyond any typical restaurant experience. They make you feel at home, while making sure you still leave there as intoxicated as you had planned on being. If you haven't been here, you need to experience it."}
{"text":"I love this place for happy hour. The first time I went at a non happy hour time when they first opened, the service was so bad that I decided to never come back again. One of the employees charged us for an item that we did not order and we let her know about the mistake. She goes to the back and comes back to our table and says something along the lines of \"well you ate it but I'll take it off the receipt. But you still ate it\" um ok? When you get 5 plates of meat brought to your table at once it's kinda hard to tell if we ordered it or not... Anyways, fast forward to 6 months later and I love this place! All of their employees now were definitely carefully picked because they are courteous, polite, and respectful. (Our server yesterday was Steven, thank you!)The meat lovers set at HH is supposed to be for 2 people but is more than enough for 3. They also have some of the best drink specials in Vegas. Check them out for a chill night with great food and drinks. :)"}
{"text":"The meat is good as well as the seafood. The combo is a good choice for a group of people. But the best-seller meat is not on the combo menu. Do recommend try the shrimp with lemon and the spicy/sweet sauce on the table. Soooo fresh and good. The beef tongue are not as good as I expected. The drinks are good. Should try some Japanese drinks with the bbq."}
{"text":"It was my first time having a group Japanese bbq with friends. Everyone was amazed by the sweet service that our waitress was able to provide. Their $55 happy hour group bbq that was supposed to be for 2 people actually feeds up to 3 people. For our group of 6, we ordered two $55 happy hour meal plan and everyone was stuffed after. That was basically $20 per person when we split the bill. We got the backroom that's reserved for large group but if I were to come back for a second time which I probably will, I would prefer a regular seating table over the backroom because it's more inclusive because by the end of the meal, my group of 6 divided themselves into 2 little groups since the backroom has 2 bbq."}
{"text":"I originally had this in New York and so when I heard it was coming to toronto I was really excited. Came here on a week day there was an hour wait for a table of 4. We got the Samurai Combo (check online) for 4 people which had a really sufficient amount of meats, veggies and sides. I highly recommend this set for a party of 4. We were extremely full and that was with 2 guys and 2 girls eating.

The quality of the different cuts of meat were great, they had good seasoning on everything. The grill set up is good because its one of those ones that sucks the smoke through the sides. Didn't find the place or our table to be too smokey so I had no issues.

The servers and manager was really attentive and explained everything as it came out from cook times to type to what sauce went well with meats. There are 3 different standard sauces to use to dip; spicy, ponzu and sweet. All tasty and enjoyable.

They also have an app that is based on rewards program, really useful and good to use if you plan on going back. Overall great experience but I personally prefer authentic korean bbq over this any day...nonetheless worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great food, but a little pricey! Good ambience and Hanson (our waiter), he's very good, great customer service, very atentative with his customer... Because of Hanson, I'll give this restaurant 10 stars for customer service... Thanks, Hanson for a great first time experience :)"}
{"text":"Great spot to eat, drink, and hang out.

Environment: The outside of the restaurant can be a little misleading in the sense that the area isn't that great and the building looks kind of small on the outside, however, upon entering it is totally different. The interior is clean and trendy, with a lot of walls breaking up the restaurant which is nice in the sense that it makes wherever you are seating feel a little more private without being cramped. They also do have seating on the lower level of the restaurant which is part of the reason that it looks so small from the outside. Additionally, the music they play is very trendy and current which I appreciated.

Food: First off, their happy hour is great. They have it every day at reasonable times and deals on basically everything from appetizers, to meat, and to the drinks. For drinks, they have various beers on draft, both Japanese and domestic, and their jumbo hot sake are great and HUGE. Food-wise I got a couple small appetizers, namely the spicy tuna volcano and the fried calamari. When ordering the meats, they usually come in small portions which allows you to try everything you want before you get full. A couple of my favorites were the miso steak, beef tongue, and bacon-wrapped scallops. Everything was very favorable. 

Service: Service was very good as well. Our server Haena was very nice and informative and was very good about checking up on us. She was consistently getting us refills on drinks, changing our grill for us, and letting us know about how much time each item we were grilling would take before it was ready to eat. 

Overall I will continue coming here, and would recommend it to anyone craving Japanese food."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner for a friend's Birthday.  The location we went to was Church street which is NOT an AYCE.  This one is a la carte. The Bloor street located is AYCE.  Restaurant is modern but the ventilation system could be better. We smelt like BBQ when we left.  Warning this place has a 2 hour limit so if you're planning to be there for a long period of time be warned they will
come to the table to kick you out.  The food quality was good and flavourful but I've had better.   We ordered the dinner for 3 and also add in a calamari appetizer.  There was more than enough food for all of us. I would give this restaurant a 4 star if they didn't come and tried to kick us out after 2 hours of seating. It's not a AYCE which I can see why they would have a time limit. We tried to get my friend a dessert to celebrate her Birthday but didn't have time because we were kicked out.  Not sure if I would come back since there's plenty other BBQ restaurants that have better service."}
{"text":"A little bit overpriced for my liking. The price increase is not proportional to the quality of the food. However, the experience was pleasant overall and service was good. I wouldn't go back to have BBQ seeing there are better choices in the city for a less inexpensive meal."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness. This place is so delicous. We came in for our friends birthday. It was our first time here. They had fantastic happy hour specials on drinks and appetizers. A giant mug of Sapporo beer was only $5! 
Our waiter was Yoshi, and he was wonderful. He was very attentive and managed to keep up with all of our orders. 
We started off with some fried pork dumplings which were absolutely delicous. We decided to get the all you can eat BBQ. There are so many different meats, fishes, vegetables, appetizers, and desserts you can choose from. Almost everything I had tried was to die for. The meats are so tender and packed full of flavor. 
I would recommend coming here with friends and family. It is a fun and different experience."}
{"text":"Japanese Korean BBQ is one of my favorites. This place is okay. It has all the basics and food is good. Prices are too high. There are better choices for less just steps away in Chinatown. Service is just okay. Sometimes good. Inconsistent. I lived in Japan for four years and ate yakiniku often. I still do, but won't return here. Second try. Too pricey. Quality is so so."}
{"text":"It was my first time dining at Gyu-Kaku and I have to say the food and service was amazing ! Jamie our server was very helpful and kind. She helped us with the menu and recommended her favorites (which we loved ).We did the all you can eat and definitely will be coming back !"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Gyu-kaku. The first time I had it was in Cali, When I found out Vegas now had a Gyu-kaku I couldn't wait to go. 
      *If you want to insure no wait when you go in make reservations Im sure they are pretty busy on weekends. 
      *Service could be a hit and miss but that is with any restaurant. If you want excellent service then request Ryan He is the best ! Very accommodating makes sure the grills get changed and brings out the food right on time. 
       * Meat is very fresh and has a lot of flavor! I add garlic to the meats but that is a personal preference.
       * General Manager Karsten , he knows how to treat his guests and makes sure they feel welcomed. Job well done. Will definitely be back to Gyu-kaku!"}
{"text":"Have to try the Kobe beef! Good food and good group menu. Ventilation could be improved but I've been to worst places. Recommend."}
{"text":"Dalvin is amazing! We love him. He's so nice, consistent on checking up on your grill and on what you need. He is our favorite waiter."}
{"text":"went in late night with friends. So good! The service was great, they sat us right away and the food came quickly. It's kind of like Korean bbq, but different marinades. We did the alacart instead of ayce and it ended up being better for us. I would for sure eat here again"}
{"text":"This restaurant located in downtown is very popular, it has some very organic decoration like tree trunks haha. We went there during lunch time and there were few people, but apparently in the evening it is super busy. We tried the meat lover set menu (55$ for 2 people), which contains 6-7 meat choices, 4 entrées et dessert (ice-cream), which is fair enough. The service is quite fast but the appetizers were a bit disappointing. Of course, the highlight is the meat and the waitress kindly told us the length of time to cook each type of meat and came to change the grill several times. In general it was a very nice lunch experience!"}
{"text":"This place was really neat--had eatten here about a month ago with a colleague/friend for lunch.  The staff is aware of the lunch 'Rush' so just let them know if you only have a short time.  Meat meat meat and I love it!  They do have lunch specials and noodle dishes that are filled with garlic (yumm and bring gum).  

I enjoyed the atmosphere here; great for groups although I would reserve before hand.  The maple vanilla ice cream did it for me!  I love maple and love vanilla and for a salty eatting person---ice cream is my all time fave dessert so this won my foodie heart!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ place! Wish they had more happy hour selection or mix and match deals but the meats are great and the service is good and the combos are a good mix of food and appetizers. 

Would definitely come back !"}
{"text":"Great for lunch!! This Japanese BBQ in the middle of downtown is a really great place if you feel like a different lunch... service was not bad ... it can be faster, but it was not terrible slow... I had the spicy tuna bowl and it was delicious and my friends had different kind of meats in the BBQ and they all really liked it! The soup was very good too! My only recommendation is not going there if you have a business meeting in the afternoon; as the smoke can get attached to your clothes, considering is a closed space and you're barbecuing meats :.. but I would definitely go back there!! 100% worthy to try!"}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this place. Came on the most important day, happy hour when a pitcher of beer is $10 and a jumbo same is $8, all day Monday & Wednesday. The decor and atmosphere was amazing with lots of seating.Started at the wrong foot when the host totally forgot about us and we had to wait a little longer at the bar than expected. 
The food here is okay. Not super stellar. It gets to the point, not much wow factor. For our party of five we decided not to do the AYCE and decided on two orders of the happy hour for 2 ($50) and we were all well satisfied. Upgrade to the fried rice I can say that the s'mores was super fun making and eating! Great place to hang out and drink for cheap."}
{"text":"Yakiniku (Japanese bbq) is one of my favourite Japanese food and I have been trying many different yakiniku in Japan, New York, Hong Kong. So when i heard Gyu Kaku was coming to Toronto i was so excited! However i was so disappointed after i went there. Firstly, there is no air conditioning in the restaurant!!! We need to wait for 45min sitting by the door, and it was 25*c outside, we were sweating and not feeling well in this hot weather, and even the staffs were sweating and face oil was all on their faces, i think this will give customers a not very good impression as i think not only restaurants have to be clean but also the staffs. This is an indoor bbq, it is unacceptable that there is no air conditioning. I felt so hot during the dinner! Second, the food also disappointed me, i dun think it is like a Japanese style bbq, but rather than a Chinese style All you can eat Korean bbq, the meat quality was very poor, very chewy and marinating by wrong seasoning, the veggie was not fresh, the tuna tataki that i ordered even had some blood in it. The only food that was delicious was the horumon (pork intestine). And i dunno why they use a Thai style spicy sauce as one of the sauces, which is not match with the Japanese style bbq. The rice they used was very bad quality and hard, which is not qualified. They shouldn't use the long rice that usually Chinese people eat. Besides they should use the Japanese short pearl rice instead. The Gyu Kaku in HK and Japan are way better than the one in Toronto. Maybe to someone who are new to yakiniku, it is okay, but to me, no way! With this kind of food quality and environment, I definitely won't go back."}
{"text":"I was here with my family .. i gave 1 because our server Ryan was excellent and fast and one of the best server otherwise i would give it 0 instead.. we done with the meal and went outside to change baby diapers but when we came back the host was cleaning our tables and said to us: \"i need the table, if u want to continue drinking you can sit at the bar\" . What kind of the costumer service is that? They wanted to kick us out because they need the table for new customers.. how about the customers still there still eating... So rude, and so disrespectful.. never got that kind of service when i went to restaurant. So sad for this business like this.. and i feel really upset right now.. for sure i wont suggest anyone to come here at all.."}
{"text":"The Japanese BBQ chain finally opened it's first location in Las Vegas.

Went with my parents to this joint and they loved it. Ended up spending around $50 dollars total for the three of us due to Happy Hour Special and Industry Specials.

We ordered...

Appetizers:
Spicy Tuna Volcano - Bomb.com
Fried Calamari - Decent
Miso Chili Wings - Pretty Good
Steamed Chili Dumplings - Basically gyoza with chili sauce and this crunchy but sticky garlic chili paste. Bomb

Vegetables:
Shishito Peppers - Can't go to a Japanese BBQ joint and not order shishito peppers...that's like declining chips & salsa at a mexican joint.
Asparagus - There's gotta be veggies somewhere..

BBQ Beef:
Filet Mignon - Cut was good, very juicy
New York Steak - One of the tables favorite choice
Bistro Hanger Steak - Not bad very simple
Angus Beef Ribs - It was cool
Harami Skirt Steak - One of the tables favorite choice
Kalbi Short Ribs - Pretty good

Everything we ordered was delicious, cook time is simple and the staff lets you know how long you should cook each item for. The great thing is you leave without the smell of meat on your clothes like them Korean BBQ joints.

Trendy type of atmosphere, drinks were good, food was good, great deals...it has AKthaBeast's stamp of approval!"}
{"text":"30 minutes before we get the first of our four lunch orders.  Unacceptable.  Especially for a dish considered a \"lunch special.\"  Green tea was luke warm and not hot. Server had to manage six different tables which obviously overwhelmed him.  Remaining orders came 45-50 minutes after we ordered and were incomplete.  I don't normally write reviews unless something is really good or extremely bad.  This experience would fit the later..."}
{"text":"I spent well over 50$ and it's unfortunate to say, it was not worth any of it. The meat was incredibly tough and dry. Even the pork belly was drybut, shouldn't because its fatty. Asked for water a few times and did not receive any. I've been to the Gyu in Boston and I would say this one is the worst of the chain. Will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"Superb slices, attentive servers and now they have a loyal customer. Me and my friends are all in a budget so most of us paid around 10-12 each and we were so full. Darwin, our server, was attentive and catered to small requests like changing the grill or water refill. He also explained everything to us about the slices and flavor profile. I'm coming back next time and order more stuff. 
The ambiance and interior was like casual Japanese style BBQ place.
Food is 10 out of 10, a bit more butter on the garlic butter next time but everything else was great.
There's a lot of parking on the side since it's close to a supermarket."}
{"text":"Very delicious and beyond excellent customer service! The bartender was nice and took the time to answer our questions, and the server (Ryan) was very attentive and thorough with his explanations. 

Aside from delicious and tasty meat, the shrimp garlic noodles are beyond scrumptious.

My complaint, which if I asked I am sure it would have been accommodated is that they do not give you separate tongs for the chicken, so you're at risk for cross contamination. But like I said, had I asked I'm sure it would've been accommodated!!!"}
{"text":"Had my first trip here with friends tonight! The place was really good. I literally liked everything we ordered and would definitely come back again and recommend it to people. I'm not a big dessert guy but some people at our table were looking fwd to the smores for dessert that came with the combination we ordered.  I guess that is the only downside of our first experience. How do you run out of Smores? It's just graham crackers, chocolate and marshmallows. Every grocery store has those ingredients across the street. Otherwise we enjoyed the visit."}
{"text":"Excellent service. The waitress is very nice and helpful. 

We ordered meat lovers for two. The price was fare, $65 I believe. The dishes looks like come with small size, but that was absolutely enough meat for two. The dishes also come with salad and fried chicken. Meat were very delicious. The sauce they use on the meat are very special, which make the bbq even better.  

Recommend to come during happy hours, they got promotion. 
Great place for bbq, will recommend my friends to come here."}
{"text":"So at 4:30pm we have to wait 15-20 mins because there is only one server and 4 tables? Wtf."}
{"text":"Best all you can eat bbq I have ever had!!!! You can choose from two ayce options; One is $35 the other is $42 which has a couple more meat varieties for you. I chose the $42 one and I promise you it's worth it! All of their meat is so tender and is well seasoned. They have good appetizers included in the all you can eat as well. And to make things even better, their desserts are ayce too!!! The service is extremely nice here as well. One thing I liked about our server in particular was the fact that he would tell us about how long each meat needed to be cooked for everytime he brought us out our meats. If you want some quality ayce bbq, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Been to the one in Cupertino.  Thought I'd try this one on this side of the West.
I'm glad I did.  
Inside is a new concept of modern architecture and old Japanese.
There's an art collection of authentic Shogun warriors.
The main entrance door is of real Japanese antique door.  Shogun costumes, etc.

The bar is shining with modern LED lights and a good collection of wines and spirits.
Bartender is super fun and friendly.  The SAKE Bomb is the highlight of the night!

Our server \"Yoshi\" is Uber friendly as well.  
Good recommendation of meat selection is really great.  I love the Harami skirt steak and the newly added Fried chicken wonton with Shiracha sauce. 
All the other meats are flavorful and tender.
Spicy tuna volcano is a big hit as well.

If you want great customer service from the servers all the way up to the highest level, this is the place to be.  Great food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Definitely Recommend this place, Go see Shane the bartender for Happy Hour! Much better then going downtown Fremont. Free parking, clean, friendly service, great quality food & beverages. Looking forward to celebrating my upcoming birthday here!"}
{"text":"Came to this location for the first time. Had a great experience. Brennan was our server and he was great. I have been on a low carb diet so it is a great place to eat for that cause I could have almost anything. The steak we had was great. Always a good place to hang with friends and enjoy a meal. I would recommend coming here to anyone."}
{"text":"We wanted to love it. We wanted to be excited. Perhaps, I wanted to love it and was overly excited to try somewhere new? Well, whichever it was...it was anticlimatic for me. My husband's review, \"it wasn't so bad\". They offered internal organs, of course he'll have such of an opinion. 

We came in on a Tuesday not too long after they opened. Immediately greeted...check. Seated...check. I was completely excited to look over their menu, especially since we happen to arrive during Happy Hour. For some reason I still can't figure out, their happy hour menu wasn't as impressive. I suppose it was because the food itself wasn't. 

ME: 
Fusion edamame (garlic seasoned edamame)
Spicy Tuna Volcano (crispy rice with spicy tuna on top)
Beef tacos (won ton wrapper fried into a taco shape with bulgogi squeezed in)
Miso Butterfish (butterfish in miso sauce with a pepper wrapped in foil to simply toss onto the grill)

HUSBAND:
Tako wasabi 
Liver (waiter said it was pork liver)
Beef Toro
Spicy Tuna Volcano
Miso Butterfish

US:
2 Kirin beer

There was nothing spicy or even tuna about this dish. The crispy rice seemed to have more.flavor than the spicy tuna. To jazz it up I made it rain with a bottle of some sauce they have on the table labeled as spicy. But that wasn't spicy at all. 

I do love they offer sweet potatoe FRIES. Having some kind of finger food for a 9months old to grasp and keep occupied is an immediate thumber-upper from me.

Miso Butterfish was alright. The sauce it steams in is very light in taste, which is a good thing for such a fish.  You get a small piece of fish, thankfully, it wasn't a small and thin piece.  Nothing spectacular. Since I do love eating fish, I still appreciated it. 

The beef tacos weren't anything spectacular either. Maybe if they slid in 2 more pcs I wouldve said they were deeelish! Just wasnt enough bite for me to thoroughly assess. A little expensive for what you get happy hour or not. Man, I'm starting to think I came in way too hungry. 

Can't review on the liver, I don't eat that stuff. Husband said twas alright. He did note that the Tako wasabi was his favorite and thought twas pretty good. So if you are into the raw stuff, that just may be your deal.

The beef Toro to me didn't look too fresh...freshly frozen...freshly defrosted frozen...freshly flashed frozen? Whichever...just didn't have that nice color to the meat the way I'm accustomed to seeing at Gangnam. It was marinated in something but upon eating it, I couldn't even taste it out. 

Prices were alright considering it was happy hour. I think I was overly excited in my head so perhaps I was expecting more. I would probably come again just to give it another shot. Maybe during a time when they didnt just open...maybe the food needed time to marinate longer? 

The best part about our meal was our 1.99 kirin beer, my fusion edamame (which was a small bowl for almost 4bucks), and my husband's Tako (small bowl.for almost 4 bucks). We spent 55 bucks, which I walked out wishing we had just went to an AYCE sushi for even less.

 I enjoyed the vibe of the restaurant, and it being well ventilated. There were a couple times our waiter lagged in service. We were nearly done eating by the time he brought our beer out. I suppose since this was noon on a weekday, we had nowhere to go...we didn't really care much. Sometimes just laying back and not having the urgency for anything is soothing to the nerves. Aside from that, overall, service was great and super friendly.

Again, I'd have to come back.. maybe less hungry too. Sometimes hunger can change your palate for sure. But for now, I don't feel like I'm missing out on life if I never did return. 

Definitely kid and stroller friendly! Just keep the kids away from the pit, aye."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch to order noodles and it's been 30 mins and no one seems to know when it's going to be served"}
{"text":"When I don't want Korean bbq, I will go for Japanese bbq, and this is my go-to spot for it. They have so many promotions/happy hours/discounts all the time it actually gets hard to keep track. Their lunch special is also a great deal. The food here tastes great. All the appetizers and choices of meat are delicious, have never disappointed. The staff here is super friendly (especially Yoshi..he's super fun), and service is great as well. There is plenty of seating, and even during busy dinner hours, I've never really had to wait too long to be seated. It's a great place for any kind of occasion with any group..family, friends, or coworkers. Love coming here on Fridays just to make it in time for their happy hour."}
{"text":"I'm always the type of gal who lofts when cooking my own food. I usually grab a few people when I'm heading over to Korean BBQ so I can gorge while others do the grunt work.
Armed with my 2 friends, we sauntered over during the weekday for a lunch. It wasn't busy, but we had just avoided the rush.

The place is decorated minimally, but quite tasteful in decor. The wooden booths were a nice touch with excellent grills that they changed if need be - not letting char build up like other places. You definitely get what you pay for at this place. I recommend getting specials if you can because it adds up with a la carte. We tried the Happy Hour course for 2. You can split amongst 3 instead because there's just that much food! 

The meat was seasoned well! My favourite cuts were the beef, beef ribs, and chicken. The filet mignon was lacking in flavour. The broccoli in a packet of foil was delicious and nicely complimented all the meat. Hands down, the Beef Sukiyaki Bibimbap was what I loved. It was perfectly cooked in the stone pot to give it the combo of the crunchy texture and full of so much flavour. We finished off the meal with mochi ice cream which was tasty. I loved the softer texture of the mochi surrounding the ice cream. However, the maple syrup ice cream was nothing special with maple syrup topping on vanilla ice cream."}
{"text":"Delicious cuts of beef, the karage is nicely fried and the service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Lord knows how many businesses have come and gone at this address over the years like Underworld, Black Label, and Emergency Room etc.  Its transformation into Gyu-Kaku has been nothing short of amazing.  The ultra cool lit entrance begged the question...does Tron eat here?  Being seated while a female sung cover of Savage Garden's \"Truly, Madly, Deeply\" at 300 BPM's blared through the stereo made me think it possible if he were drunk.  

We considered the course dinners priced at $55, $66 and $77 for a moment but saw a lot of filler that would have ended up untouched like cheese wontons, chicken cheese fondue, house salad, fried chicken (ok,ok, maybe one piece), calamari and S'mores.  Our initial server, Keiko, recommended we start with the spicy cabbage salad over the kim-chee.  Thankfully, we listened.  Crispy, spicy and dare I say refreshing?  It was a fine way to whet our appetite.        
 
Standing out among with meats was the beef tongue and harami skirt steak.  Quality matched the price and both delivered on what decent yakiniku should be.  We also enjoyed the kalbi short rib and although the Angus beef ribs were a little too fatty for the wife, I happily devoured it.  The mushroom medley cooked in an unbeatable combination of soy sauce and butter was a nice side dish.  

The only letdown was the \"Spicy Kalbi Bibimbap\".  They got the stone pot right but the rest of it?  It was as if it were made by a northern Swedish resident with no knowledge of Korean cuisine attempting to replicate it through hearsay.  I would have rather ordered the sliced duck breast, an atypical yakiniku offering, or dessert over this pointless filler.  

Despite that, I know I'll be back and stick to grilling.  It's yet another welcome dining choice around Spring Mountain.  3.46729311238987 stars."}
{"text":"First of all I Love the Gyu kaku franchise. The only reason I'm giving thing a 3 star is because the fact we found a long ladies hair in the bibimap. The service needs work of course since it's only the soft opening. The meat quality is good all the marinades is just like all the California ones. Overall this place is way better than all the Asian BBQ spots in Las Vegas. I will be coming back! Hopefully no hair in food next time."}
{"text":"I love Gyu-Kaku salad and sapporo pitcher is $7.50 right now. Price is good and also service is great too."}
{"text":"I'm so happy Gyu-Kaku finally has a location in Montreal. The food is as good as other locations (e.g., Cupertino and San Mateo California, Chicago, Boston, and Miami). The service is a bit slow. However, it is by far the best BBQ place in the city--definitely better than any other local restaurant! I have been to this place 3 times in the past 3 weeks and will definitely come back again! Oh and another thing I really like about this location is that the wait is not as long as US locations."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for a birthday dinner for a party of eight. Service was HORRIBLE and SLOW maybe because the restaurant automatically charges you 18% gratuity.

I advised the hostess that , it is a birthday dinner. Arrived and ordered combo dinners. I noticed that the server did not bring out all of the dishes. She then apologized and brought out the missing dishes. Asked for a refill for hot tea but had to wait at least 10 mins for a refill. Rice was under cook. Service was slow and to top it off, the server and the crew did not sing a happy birthday. I will find out the servers name and will update. I will not be returning. 

***********++++BAD SERVICE***************++++++"}
{"text":"Favorite Japanese bbq place in Vegas!!! Our service is always consistent and amazing. Monday's/Wednesday's they have happy hour all day....we enjoy the food so much we come any day we crave it. Their meats are full of flavor and marinated just right. They do have an AYCE menu but it's more cost effective to go with one of their combos. Last visit we actually did AYCE and actually ended up eating was less meat and paid more. Definitely suggest going online to OpenTable to make a reservation prior to, even if it's before you head down there. They're always busy on the weekends but very worth the wait."}
{"text":"Didn't expect this restaurant to be pretty inside on where it's located.  They changed their hours til 2am, and one of happy hours was offered from 10pm-2am.  Sat in a booth right by the kitchen, but didn't mind when our server was busy running back and forth.  Then to find out it was only two servers that night.  For that situation it was good be sat there because we were always able to see him or catch him if we needed to order more.
Kalbi short rib and bacon wrapped aspargus were my favorite.  Sauces on table were ok, but the spicy crunchy garlic sauce you can order was delicious.  Want to try to steamed chili dumplings next time because they were out.  Will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"First time to try this place. I really love that they have happy hour, it's so reasonable. The meats were delicious, except for the NY Steak, that one didn't have much flavor and was very chewy. The bistro and other meats were yummy. The side dishes are nice, but I recommend getting mostly meat if you want a fuller meal. Even with happy hour, these dishes are pretty small and they do add up. 

Our waiter wasn't that great, he put the stove up too high and didn't check up on us if we needed refills or wanted to order more. We had to wait for another waiter to come around. 

All in all it's a good place to eat if you want tasty food and are also on a budget. Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"The chain has finally made it to Montreal thanks to the growing Asian community. The quality of the meat cuts are undeniable, the quantity of the set menus are more than sufficient so it's really not necessary to be an all you can eat compared to the Korean BBQ next door. The Harami Skirt Steak in Miso Marinade and Certified Angus Kalbi Short Rib in Tare Sweet Soy Marinade are the staples. We also ordered some sides such as the mushrooms that was nicely perfumed, the spinach was a bit too drenched in butter. The only thing that was disappointing was the tofu stew, it was so salty we could not finish it. I do wish there was more choices like different chicken cuts etc that was very common in Japan over grill and it will be something easy to incorporate in the menu.  The quality of the meat and other sides are a great motivation to be back and furthermore if they added more things. Even though the place is big with usually large groups the ambiance is quiet and relaxing that can makes it also a great date dinner.  Reservation is needed as is it still very popular."}
{"text":"Would have been nice if we had gotten our reserved time for today. Showed up and received a notification for reservation booked for tomorrow instead en route. Was also told that no reservations were possible for the weekend but they do take it which we found through our own Google skills. Not sure what's going on here but the service is not what I would expect from an actual Japanese restaurant so far. Let's see what they come up with as a resolution. Hopefully the food will make up for this. 

Waited 30ish minutes past our \"reservation time\", by the time we got our first dishes it was about an hour past it. 

The tuna volcano app was terrible, it tasted way to heavy handed and it was difficult to identify what was actually tuna. The tataki on the other hand was under seasoned. The meat was decent, I didn't like most of the marinades they used as it was not traditional and pretty overpowering however the quality was okay. The menu seemed very Asian fusion; kimchi, chijae....I wish they would have stuck to the menu they have in Japan. If I want Korean BBQ, there are so many other places I would go to for that. 
 Saw a waitress grab a handful of scallions with their hands between using the computer.

Overall it was not worth the wait, but once the hype dies down I may come back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing all around! No AYCE, but their combos will definitely fill you up. The best time to go is their happy hour. You get discounted combos, appetizers, a la carte, and drinks. 

I really enjoy the design of this restaurant. It's modern and clean. The atmosphere is really comfortable and the tables are separated from each other unlike most so you're not staring at another party eating.

I fell in love with the peach soju cooler drink. They're dangerous; delicious and quick to take down.  

My favorite part is at the end, if you order a combo, they pull off the grill and give you s'mores to cook over an open flame! It's so fun."}
{"text":"It was good. But I'm still sitting here eating and the staff seems to be rushing us out of here. It feels very awkward and uncomfortable. The waiter came back to \"check\" on us every 1 minute. 

Our dessert came when I was still in the middle of grilling meat. I understand that there was a big group waiting but I felt like I couldn't enjoy the end of my meal. We were there for less than 2 hours and there were definitely other tables who came before us."}
{"text":"Really fun and casual restaurant. I have been here a couple times now though the service has always been amazing. I loved the roasted mushrooms and vegetables!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place!  The service is excellent, prompt, polite and attentive. For two people we got the premium meat lovers with the bibimbop and it was plenty!  We were stuffed by the end of the meal.  Yes, you are basically paying to cook your own food, but they prepare it for you, presented nicely and some are marinated. Everything in small bites tastes delicious. The soup is just the right amount of sodium, the salad is balanced well with the right amount of ingredients, chicken karaage comes out piping hot and the bibimbop is actually served in a hot stone bowl that cooks the rice while you're enjoying your meats (unlike Anju).  

We liked the real chopsticks as it is nice to sit down at a restaurant and not have to pull apart and sand down your utensils before you eat. It is a bit loud and smokey obviously, but they do have a coat check if you ask, that reduces the smell to your outerwear a bit.  They probably don't have a strong exhaust system, so your clothes and hair will smell afterwards, but it's a fun place and I would recommend it and also will visit again!"}
{"text":"We had a fun and flavorful meal at the new Las Vegas location of Gyu-Kaku on Decatur and Spring Mountain last night.  Eight of us came for dinner and were seated quickly without needing a reservation.  The staff is very friendly here and our waitress explained the menu and all of the options available for our meal.  The Harami Skirt Steak is currently a promotional item at 50% off the regular price per order.  We shared several different items including the skirt steak special, Bistro Hanger Steak, Garlic Shrimp, Bacon-Wrapped Asparagus, Spinach Garlic, Shisito Peppers, Fried Bacon Chips, Edamame, and Shrimp Sukiyaki Bibimbap. There were two charcoal grills for our party, one for four people each, and the guys did the bbq'ing for the gals.  I really enjoyed the Harami Skirt Steak as it had a great miso flavor and no extra sauce was necessary for seasoning.  It was also my first time having bibimbap and I loved it. Those two dishes are ones that I'd definitely have again.
This is a great place to come with your friends so you can share lots of different menu items and socialize over some good food.  Gyu-Kaku also offers \"BBQ Courses,\" specials for two people that start at $55 and include many menu items from appetizers to entrees to dessert, a value over ordering a la carte; I think we may try that the next time around when we're hungrier.  I've heard the Happy Hour is also good, but we'll have to wait a couple of weeks for that to start, according to the staff.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is our first time to this location.  We been to the Honolulu location over a dozen times. 

Food was excellent.  Our server was awesome.  She was very prompt. The restaurant was very very clean. 

The beef tongue and ahi poki was awesome. 

I did not care for the miso butter fish. It didn't look like how it usually does. It looked like 3 blocks of calamari with not much flavor. I don't recommend  the calamari either, it was very small."}
{"text":"Just came back from the restaurant tonight.  feel like sharing my experience with people.  The environment was very good.  Its hard to see such scale of restaurant locally.  The server told me that this restaurant cost about 2 million.  Each stove cost about 10 grand.  The smoke was sucked under neath, so your cloth will not smell after the meal. The menu looks pleasant. beautiful pictures.  Service was good.  He changed my grill 4 times during the meal.  These are all the good parts.  Now here comes the food.  the appetizer we ordered was spicy tuna volcano.  of 1 to 5, I will give it a one.  tuna has no flavor, the deep fried rice ball was hard.  two very different textures did not match well at all.  For the BBQ, I ordered scallop, Kalbi, Harami, Tongue, Chicken fondue.  They have 3 kinds of sauce, Ponzu, Sweet Soy, Spicy sauce.  The Ponzu was blend with out a kick or freshness.  The Sweet soy is too sweet that over powers the meat flavor easily, and you can just tell it was thickened by corn starch.  spicy sauce was Korean style base which was still on the sweet side.  So I am not impress with the sauce.  The scallop was fresh and I have no complaint.  But the meat is really just so so.  The reason is that the cut was bad.  some thick, some thin, some stringy, some wide.  they just want to make it to the weight, (which is only 4 to 5 oz. per order) for $9.00!  And they cut the meat along the grain.  which is a huge no no for bbq.  I feel like they want to cut cost by using the end parts and cut the meat any way they can to make the portion.  The marinate was too sweet and overpowering the meat flavor.  However the marinate flavor was not too bad, So if you like Korean bbq style, you will like it but If you like real Japanese BBQ, you should go try Yagyu( the 2 story building by the China town) They do it right.  The chicken, they use breast, which is very dry, and the fondue is just not what I am expecting when I am trying to eat bbq.  The cheese was overpowering.  The chicken was sticking on the grill.  The grill they use is metal, really easy to get blacken by the sweet sauce.  thats why the server has to change it so often(in the middle of your cooking)  I prefer Yagyu's.  They use cast iron grill, you can put a block of beef fat on it to enhance the flavor.  And the chicken will not stick.  Because yagyu is the first \"Japanese\" bbq place in town, so I compare between the two a lot.  For the draft beer, hands down yagyu is far better.  The mug was stored below freezing.  So when the beer comes, the whole mug is covered with frost and the beer was frozen in side the mug and float to the top.  If you are beer lover, you really have to go try Yagyu's draft beer.  Tonight's beer just looks sad.  And I don't like their rice.  To me, a perfectly cooked rice is just as important as the meat.  because you eat them together.  Rice brand or the type of grain of the rice was not good.  For $1.95 a bowl, they should put out something better.  Over all, for the environment, and if you want to impress some people, they will do the job.  The food is acceptable.  But for the bbq, Yagyu is the way to go."}
{"text":"Everything was sooooooooooooo amazingly delicious! Better than the location in Waikiki. The service was also great. Everyone was on point. Definitely returning soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious chow to be had here. We got the all you can eat and it's a real treat. The rice bowls are really good (beef sukiyaki). Fun fir the kids too. Super great service."}
{"text":"Food here is delicious, prices are moderate. Gyu-kaku is a Japanese bbq grill where you are served raw marinated meat and cook the food yourself on a gas/charcoal grill build into the table. The decor here is very intimate. Lots of seats and dim lighting, tables are close together but the dim lighting give you a sense of privacy. Monday and Wednesday they have ALL DAY HAPPY HOUR. They have happy hour food deals and $10 pitchers of Sapporo ( about 6-7 glasses) and $8 jumbo house sake. Food here is good. My table ordered the happy hour dinner for 2, it was $50 for an assortment of appetizers, meats, and s'mores as dessert. I recommend upgrading the ride to bimibop for extra $3. The meat is marinated well and they have ponzu, sweet soy, and spicy sauces at each table (the spicy sauce was my favorite, it's more sweet than spicy). You have to cook your own food and I recommend someone to keep an eye on the food because most meats cook faster than you think. Overall, food here is good, service was good but nothing spectacular, the bill can add up if you're ordering with your eyes and not your stomach. I recommend anyone to try but I can't see myself eating here more than once every 5-6 months."}
{"text":"It is rare that I don't have anything bad to say about a restaurant.

The restaurant is clean, modern. The staff is extremely friendly, passionate, they all seem to enjoy working there.

We got the premium meat lover's plate for two. While I do not remember which meat was the best, I would say that all of them were really well prepared and tasted really good.

I went to this restaurant twice from how good it was(Something I don t do often in Montreal since we do have a huge variety of restaurants in town). And I will definitely go back :)"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: Honestly, it's kind of a hidden gem. I find the restaurant a little bit hard to spot. On the inside, everything is quite modern and super lovely. 

FOOD: Top notch. When I came here, I was in a group so naturally, we got the group combo. And wow. Their meat is definitely high quality and is flavored to perfection. Although the portions seem a bit small, it definitely fills you up. Their rice dishes are delicious as well. I loved absolutely everything. I would recommend this place to anyone 100%. 

PRICE: A tad bit more expensive but considering the quality that you get, definitely worth it.

SERVICE: The service was excellent when I came. Seeing how it was a new restaurant, the waitress took the time to explain how the menu worked, what was included, what each cut consisted of and how it should be paired with in terms of sauce. Super friendly!"}
{"text":"You just have to check this place out. If you have lived in town for any length of time you know that this particular building has been many different dining and bar establishments but hopefully Gyu-Kaku is here to stay!  

We checked it out on a whim and now it is one of our regular favorites.  We have taken several of our friends here and they've all loved it. It's great for date night and it's great for families. The grill is far enough away from kids depending on where you seat them.  The kids love the s'mores at the end and enjoy watching the cooking at the table. The meat is amazing. Pay attention to how long they want you to cook it. The Toro beef is the best. We always get an extra order or two of that.  The staff has always been super friendly and accommodating. Download their app to get dining rewards. Not long and you can get $25 off your bill!  They do reservations on Open Table online which makes it super easy to book. I definitely recommend having a reservation on the busier days."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place only 2 stars because they're quality of the food was just not good. We ordered the surf and turf course and were highly disappointed. The dressing on the salad had a funky taste. And the tuna poke that was served was just a grainy texture in my mouth. Plus the onions they had as a garnish were sour. The chili dumplings were only luke warm but the sauce was good. The meat was so so and the cheese sauce that was served with the broccoli was way to oily and wouldn't even stick when dipped. As for the service, it was very pleasant. The hostess greeted us right away and so did the server. Sorry but $70 is just not worth it."}
{"text":"Love love love it.  Food was very good. 1st time here came for late night happy hour.  Price good staff excellent!  Nice atmosphere.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Their service is nice, not noisy a place to eat , but only to compensate the poor quality/price ratio. Toooooo expensive for what they offer. Korean bbq on st Catherine are way better."}
{"text":"I love gyu-kaku!  There's one in Houston, and so when I found this gem in Calgary I was so excited.  Excellent prices for Japanese bbq at lunch - get their lunch special and gorge yourself to your heart's content.  The 15.95 lunch special is excellent - a selection of 3 delectable meats with rice, salad, and soup.  That's a lot of food though, so next time I'll probably go for the 12.95 option with 2 meats.  I was thinking I was already at the satisfied point with 2 meats.

You can't go wrong with sizzling marinaded meats on the grill.  Cooked fresh, tender, and tasty."}
{"text":"This place was more than I expected the service was great Erin really took care of us and was very attentive. The ambiance was great. I recommend for a first time to get the meat lovers course the food comes out quickly and it's a lot of food for the price and as usual my favorite part of dinner is  dessert you get smores which ends the meal in a very happy place in heaven."}
{"text":"This is an awesome Japanese BBQ place to go to if you're craving for these types of food. I ordered the Miso Butter Ramen noodles, and it is delicious!! My dad ordered the Karaage rice bowl with the spicy sauce on the side. The prices are phenomenonal, and the location is easy to find. They were able to seat is in even though we didn't have a reservation. I took some pictures of the menu and our food. The menu in the other original pictures are 9 months old, and you can't use the specials menu on a holiday. Only on a regular day? So that was a bit disappointing. The ramen is $10 on the regular lunch menu. They only have two kinds. And the karaage bowl is $9. That's a very phenomenonal price!!! 

I will definitely go to this restaurant again when we're going to Calgary!! 

Without further a do... The pictures!!"}
{"text":"Went on Saturday 1-16-15 at 12:10 PM and just happened to be there during their happy hour which is from 12-6:30 on Saturdays. Their HH is not the best value ever as most items were only $1-2 dollars off (not half off like most places).  As soon as we were seated our server brought waters and turned on the grill.  Our server was absolutely wonderful, helpful, friendly, and every time he dropped off a raw item he gave us advice on how to cook it.  
.
$57.40 got us a gyu salad (half portion), an order of spring rolls, infusion edamame, chicken karaage, garlic rice, white rice, cheesy corn, duck breast, kobe beef, shrimp, and filet mignon.  
. 
Gyu-Kaku Salad (half portion is $3.95)- Romaine I think with hard-boiled egg, some sort of radish on top (maybe daikon?), red pepper, cucumber, tomatoes, and a dressing sort of like thousand island.  It was fresh and crispy and I liked it. 
. 
Vegetable Spring Rolls ($2.99)-Lovely crispy thin wonton wrapper and was served piping hot but unfortunately the inside was total mush.  I would pass on these.  
. 
Infusion edamame ($3.50)- Cooked well but was swimming in an orange fat and garlic which I was burping up all day.  Although it was tasty, I do not recommend it if you have a sensitive tummy. 
. 
Chicken Karaage ($2.99) Delicious slivers of dark meat chicken fried to a perfect crisp with an orange mayo-based sauce.  Just get five orders of this and don't share.  
.
Garlic rice ($3.99) Very large portion but tasted awful to me.  Rice was overcooked and mushy but it was full of raw garlic and piles of sauteed onions.  I would pass on this.  Definitely don't eat this if you have a date because you will not be called for a second date.   
.
Cheesy corn ($3.95) Maybe 4 spoon-fuls of canned corn and the cheese was missing.  Not impressed. 
.
Duck breast ($6.95) I wasn't expecting duck at a yakiniku place but it was very fresh and each piece had a nice strip of fat.  It was delicious.  
. 
Kobe flat-iron steak ($12.95) So tender and delicious.  Nice marbling of fat.  Didn't even need sauce with this one.  Highly recommend.  
. 
Garlic Shrimp ($5.95) Shrimp were huge and succulent but the garlic marinade was somewhat chemical-tasting.  Did not enjoy.  
.
Filet mignon ($6.95) 21 day dry aged chunks of filet mignon.  Incredibly tender and delicious, although they really needed some salt or dipping sauce.  
. 
Everything was tasty and fun but rather expensive and my husband and I spent the next two days in the restroom (SORRY TMI) so either they served us some questionable food or we are just pansies that can't handle their food.  Either way...I'm not goin' back."}
{"text":"Have never been to Japanese bbq before. The food was great. We did meat lovers and surf and turf and had more food than we could eat for 5 people.  It was fun cooking our food. Beers were priced right too. Our waiter, Yoshio, was fantastic. He did a great job of explaining the menus to us and then he just kept bringing the food very quickly. Will definitely recommend to others and will be going back. What a fun place!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to BBQ gathering place. We all absolutely love their meat combos! All their meats are of great quality, although I do love the beef slices the best.
We order their Sapporo pints every time we go there. I fully enjoy every sip of it, but it just seems like their Sapporo is a little lighter than the usual ones to me. Not sure if it is slightly watered down or it is just because of the iciness. Although it is a total bargain for sure.
Their staff seem to be in a good spirit all the time. They try their best to give you details about your meat and how to cook them. But they seem to have a very hard time dealing with bill splitting for a big group and using the points from their app. The last time it took them one whole hour to sort out our bills, and they did not even apply our points correctly in the end. It was absolutely exhausting/disappointing for us."}
{"text":"Delicious food, Great atmosphere and always a great time. Probably the best drink prices in town. Best part is their service and staff. Had different servers but all of them were just awesome! Ask for Jaime or Chris!"}
{"text":"They lose a star cause i nearly lost an eyebrow! Only cause i kept turning the burner up when i was told not to...oops. Great concept, great food, great service. Fair pricing when you can do the couple special for $55. Plenty of food. And you cook it on a burner in your table. The sauces for dipping are great and the smores for desert...fogetabooooouuut it! A great date spot. Will go back. And no hairspray on the brows next time!"}
{"text":"This place looked pretty amazing until we began our dinner. The wait was around 35 minutes, even though the server tells us it will be 20 mins. They are nice and the service yells out random Japanese sayings when you enter and leave. 

The server was great, they did not provide water, the food was very salty and to top it off, they do not know how to change the plates for the grill. While changing the grills, the server dropped the plate a little too hard and splashed on my Fiance. We were not impressed for the slightest. 

The food selection was great, there are a lot of choices, but very pricey. I would rather opt to all you can eat at Korean Grill House which is not too far from here. 

They do have specials but overall very pricey. Something to try is the Takiyaki which is a red bean waffle that you grill and it comes with a side of ice cream. ($5)"}
{"text":"We've been here several times in 2014, and continued on into New Years Day lunch. FYI- They are normally not open for lunch. 

Normally you go to a restaurant for service, food taste and quality, and lastly price. At least that's what I look for in a restaurant that we frequent.

Service: When we first discovered Gyu-Kaku, the service was prompt, attentive ad courteous.  Fast forward 3-4 months later, we waited for seats in a half empty restaurant.  Our meats were not served at the same time.  As in we went through 6 different meats and then the 7th showed up.  This was after we ate the first 6.  And this was just my husband and I dining.  Not to mention the disappearing soda refill that appeared 10 minutes later. Not happy since he was now a grumpy lunch date.

Food Taste: We love the taste of the food here. Simple. Easy. Delicious. It helps when you're the chef! I haven't purchased any pre-cooked items from the kitchen.

Food Quality: I have to admit that Gyu-Kaku is highly consistent with their cuts of meat and seasonings. Tender Filet Mignon! Beefy Angus Beef Ribs. Chicken seasoned impeccably.  

Price: Happy Hour is a steal!  And there are two time periods 5-6:30 and after 9pm. 

The customer service will deter us from returning, but the food taste and quality makes me want to come back."}
{"text":"We had the most terrible experience in a Gyu-Kaku. First the cooktop didn't work. The server came by trying to work it. It didn't work. The host came by trying to work it, he insisted to come by after 2 minutes despite us telling him it's been ten minutes and it didn't work!! So he had to move us after that. A ramen noodle came after EVERYTHING was finished. By the time the check comes, we were charged 2 miso soups that were part of the lunch combos we ordered, an extra meat, and a more expensive combo for a total difference of $15. The waiter looked as if he's surprised that he's caught. Carefully inspect your check before you pay. We've been to other Gyu-Kaku before, and we were here solely because we had good experiences in other locations, and it turned out so disappointing. As we were straightening out the check, the table to the left of our new table had a cooktop/grill malfunction, and they had to move those customers. Then as we were leaving, a new group of guest were placed on that very same table. It made me think they knew what grills don't work, but they place the costumer there regardless. Terrible customer service!!  I'll give it a zero if that's an option."}
{"text":"The service is excellent. The server was friendly, informative, and never annoying.

The food was great. Meat was seasoned pretty well, and I especially love the Beef Garlic noodles. As for cooking the meat, I would just base it on what you think/ feel/ see is cooked or not, for me, I usually cook it longer than what they recommend anyway. As for the dessert I tried, Mochi ice cream- too sweet, and maple-syrup icecream- fine, but not to die for in my opinion. (Too be fair, I'm not really a ice cream fan anyway :P) 

The setting was nice. It has a hip kind of vibe. The music was not 'cringy' loud either :).

Looking at some other reviews, I think its unfair to give a bad review because you're bad at cooking lol.

Great experience overall!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place because I love the gyukaku back in Hawaii. 
The food was alright. Some were the same like the ones back home but some tasted really different. For one, the cheese wontons had a weird cheese dip for it when usually it would come with japanese mayo. This made me sad because it was one of my favorites at gyukaku. But overall, nothing beats the gyukaku back in Hawaii. I would still try this place again. I did go when they just opened so maybe it'll be different next time."}
{"text":"Ok...I love the food. We got the meat-lovers platter and the happy hour platter, so we really got to sample most of the meat offered, even tongue and liver, and a ton of drinks. I think the whole idea is fun, cooking your own perfectly seasoned food, but I did find it a bit pricey. 

There are plenty of other Korean BBQ places that give you all you can eat for cheaper prices.

**For your birthday they sing to you and bring you ingredients to make smores:)"}
{"text":"Completely enjoyed the meal and the service. A tad pricey for what you get, but cooking your own protein is fun. I would to happy to return."}
{"text":"After years and years of going to Korean BBQ, I didn't know it could get better with Japanese BBQ, but it has. I've been to this location just the once, but I have been to their chain in Vancouver before.

This location in Calgary is quite big, with lots of seating and space for big groups, if needed. I would still recommend making a reservation, none-the-less, as I find the restaurant gets busy around dinner time, especially on the weekends. They do seem very family friendly, though, as I've seen small children and they have a children's menu. There isn't a lot of street parking, but there are two parking lots down the block, if needed. I believe the on the left (the Impark) is free after 6 pm, despite what they say on their website (NOT the WestPark - that one still charges after 6). 

In regards to service, servers are usually quite quick and prompt. Most servers are Asian and may or may not speak English fluently. That being said, they are usually quite helpful and can offer recommendations if needed. In addition, they always tell you what dish is arriving, so you know what you are tasting. 

The food here is the best part, of course! Unlike Korean BBQ (which my friend complains only has one flavour), Gyu's different dishes all taste very distinctly different. They choose marinades and sauces to compliment the flavour of the meat itself. You can really taste the marbling on the beef, for example. You are also provided with dipping sauces, but to be honest, they're not really needed - the meat itself is quite flavourful. 

The other thing I really enjoy about Gyu (and all BBQ places), is the ability to grill your own food. I think there is so much fun and pleasure you can get out of cooking your own food; you can char it as much as you like, cook it medium, cook it rare, etc. It's also a fun activity to share with family or friends in a group. 

In addition to that, I also appreciate that Gyu offers other things on their menu besides their BBQ. In particular, they have their garlic noodles and their rice bowls which are both delicious and make for a great lunch. 

On both occasions I've been to Gyu, we've ordered off their value menus. I think this is the best bang for your buck, since you can try a little of everything and still walk away full from the meal!"}
{"text":"Good quality meat at affordable price
It's really exciting to see gyu kaku opened in Toronto!!! Best BBQ place!"}
{"text":"Best Asian BBQ in the town, and has zero competitors. The quality of the meat is absolutely gorgeous. The service is nice and polite. 5 stars without a doubt."}
{"text":"I would prefer to give it 3.5 stars but don't have the option. 

Gyu-Kaku is a wonderful place to eat but dirty and grimy. I knew nothing of this place other than Yelp reviews. As I pulled up to the restaurant I realized that I had seen this place a 100 times or more as I drove by it. It's unassuming, not a hole in the wall, but nothing that ever jumped out to me to pique my interest.

Walking in, I realized this place had been there for a while or at least appears to have. Sitting down at the table I noticed stains on my wife's napkin. This quickly set off all in the party looking at silverware, napkins, table, surroundings. It was dirty, not a place I like to eat at. We were there though and I had a gift card from a Christmas present so we decided to hold our noses and push on. (It didn't smell bad, just using as an expression)

To my delight, the food was all very good. All the meats tasted well and since you cook your own food I would like to give compliments to the chef! We ordered a large array of meats with different seasonings and marinade. I couldn't tell you which one I like the most because they were all truly wonderful. The only thing we didn't enjoy were the garlic mushrooms, they lacked flavor, not what we expected. 

The service was okay, we waited at least 25 minutes to get our check and another 10 once she took our cards to pay. This is mostly overlooked because my wife and I enjoyed our friends company. Our waitress did take time to explain menu items and was pleasant. 

Overall I would go back, the food was very good. I hope it was a one off with the service and that ownership will take this as a hint that maybe they need to go through their building and do a nice deep cleaning. Serious though how easy is it to not place dirty napkins back on the tables, lazy!

{"text":"Food is great. I have been twice. Once with a colleague from work for lunch, and once with my family. Lunch during the week is a great value for the quality of food you get, along with the quantity. I was definitely happy paying $13.99 for, what was, an amazing meal. Even with my family of four, the total was under $100 including tip. Nobody walked away hungry. I definitely recommend this place and will re"}
{"text":"Our grill didn't cook evenly but the service was great and good was tasty.  A but pricey but the atmosphere and quality food fit the price"}
{"text":"Food never fails to be delicious. I like the various beef dishes the best. And it's fun to cook. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"So I've become very fond of this place and I know my review wasn't that great before but my 5 star review is going to Steven because he was honestly the best customer service I've ever experienced!!!! Always smiling happy and willing to help us out and do whatever he can to make us enjoy our time! He was very informative, helpful, friendly, and seriously made us enjoy our delicious food even more. I wish that everyone could learn a bit of something from him!!! Waters never went empty. Never went without asking us if we were okay or needed anything. He was truly 5 star service. I wish I could get him every time. Food, in my POV, has also become much better in my eye. Also very good quality compared to other bbq places."}
{"text":"A modern Japanese restaurant. It's nice to come after 9pm for their happy hour. I really enjoyed the ramen at this location. Also you have to try their calmari. Super good!"}
{"text":"Gyu kaku is the largest yakiniku chain to arrive in americaland and they set a pretty decent standard of what a yakiniku experience would look and feel like in Japan. 

A tip for the Noobs: 
You can have the meat marinated and prepared any way you want. I you just say I want the Kalbi. they will just bring you whatever they have done or just the plain cut. I think that most ot the people with marginal reviews here are because the reviewer did not know how to pick the meat.

My favorite meat/sauce combinations are:
Kalbi miso
Harami miso
Garlic sirloin
Toro beef gochujang
Kalbi gochujang

If you aren't sure on the meat/sauce combo, then the best course is to order a set.
I will be honest and say I'm not a fan of the prepared foods that come with the meal sets. The chicken karaage and cheese gyoza are just meh: fried fillers. The sushi is not anything special and I have to keep reminding myself that I'm here for meat not sushi. I don't expect Jiro level sushi but it's still mediocre even for American west coast standards. 

Their happy hour is probably one of the best in town especially the late night super happy hour (red prices on the menu).

Gyu-Kaku is now the de facto place to go for Japanese yakiniku in Vegas. Go for the meat and beer and nothing else.

Eat with confidence."}
{"text":"pricey place but I thought it was way worth it, great flavor and cuts of mean. The salads just weren't my thing. The service was great, always coming back to check how we were doing. Book a reservation prior, this place get busy and the wait is long"}
{"text":"I mean....The fire pit was not even and the grill mat was sticky,which make my food really undelightful... It produce smoke no matter how many time they change the grill. We finally find out it was the stove itself that wasn't maintained at all. So much residue in there. All good beef became smoky after all.
 My server always forget my order. I was glad that I check what I ordered...AND MY SCALLOPS WERE BITTER INSIDE....Disappointing experience."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!! Went there on Christmas day and everyone was great..food amazing..service good and my family loved the idea of something new on Christmas!   Highly recommend especially for special events. We got the $77 surf n turf which didn't seem like alot but with the many courses it was. Also they gave us a deal. Amazing!!"}

40 minuets later the sever that I talked showed up and told me I still need to wait half hour even there are empty tables everywhere, because the sever are all too busy"}
{"text":"Ive been going to gyu kaku for quite a while now. I love this place. My last visit was 4/20 around 10pm. The place was packed, which is normal. So me and my partner decided to sit at the bar. The bar was a mess. There was leftover ramen bowls and plates everywhere. Nevertheless we decided to just put the dirty dishes off to the side of the bar. The bartender then comes to us and wipes the bar. I greeted her and she greeted me back with the same exact greeting I gave her and started laughing( seemed like she was mocking me.) My car keys were on the bar. She took them, wiped the bar then threw my keys on the bar. She just laughed. I didn't think it was funny. She seemed intoxicated because she was taking shots with the customers. Then we were deciding to get something to eat from the bar. She over heard mr and said \"If you guys wanna order food just wait  be seated coz I'm closing the bar soon.\" Only to find out the bat doesn't close till 12?! Then a couple sat at the bar and I could see her rolling her eyes coz she got new customers. I just ended up leaving and it just ruined my night to be honest. I get it you're tired and you wanna leave soon but I work in the industry and will never treat customers like that. Customers bring the business they should be taken care of with quality service."}
{"text":"Service was friendly, food was below average, but the biggest redeeming quality of this restaurant is the happy hour specials. 

The drinks were tasty and cheap, so I give them three stars for that. I'd be back for that alone. 

As far as the food, I would skip most of the items we ordered including the ramen, crispy rice with tuna and even the pork belly. They were pretty stingy with the meat dishes and the flavor on the rest of the food was just disappointing overall. The ramen had an unpleasant flavor to it that I can't quite identity and the tuna was not particularly fresh and the rice wasn't crispy enough. It had a very fishy smell and taste that I found unappealing. The pork belly wasn't fatty enough and kept sticking to the grill. The only items I would order again on the food front was the kalbi

Yes to the drinks, no to the food."}
{"text":"Flavor: Meh 
Service: Could improve 
Overall Opinion: Go somewhere else

Been to Gyu-Kaku many times before in Southern-California. Always had a great experience but the Las Vegas location was very disappointing. Came here to celebrate my birthday with my friends and got the Premium AYCE price for $42. Our server, Erik, was very professional and kind but the overall experience would not bring me back to this location.

As a party of 6, it took the kitchen awhile to get our meat order out. We were in no rush, so it wasn't a big deal. When the food came, they were overly salted. This included salads being drenched in dressing and beef tongue having a white layer of salt. It was so bad that we asked them to take it back. I had to eat a good chuck of rice to balance out the saltiness. I guess this is how they make their customer's eat more rice instead of meat. 

Felt bad for Erik. He was working many tables and the kitchen wasn't helping his cause. Needed to get a grill change and it took us about 10 minutes to get his attention. Wasn't the best service but it wasn't his fault that the restaurant was under-staffed. Thanks Erik!

Got the bill and of course there was gratuity since we had a party of six. The thing that irked me was that they taxed gratuity. Not sure if it was legal to tax gratuity but they did."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Walk in, we were NOT greeted and ask if they do kid menus and we were told it was $7. Okay, cool. Then we asked about the all you can eat, we could do that too. We were told that we had to sit down and order it, and we get the 90 min for our $30 all you can eat. Nice! So we wait, patiently. Get seated and ask for a booster, 20 min go by and my toddler is swinging around in the restaurant making me not even want to eat there anymore!!! But i stay patient. No booster, no waters, no server! Then, when our server does come we get told 1. There are NO KID MENUS!!! I have 5 kids so this is important to me. I was getting up to leave. And i ask to speak to a manager who by the way still did not approach me to apologize for any confusion or clarification. 

But my server comes back and tells me that we can do the kid menu. cool, we can do that. So we start ordering again. 

Only to find out that we still couldn't do the dang kid menus if we wanted to do the damn $30 all you can eat?!

I left and CALLED this time to speak to a manager. Still NO answer NO CLARIFICATION!

This is by far the worst experience ive ever had. Honestly i don't care if its Christmas -- and that you're busy. You are a restaurant establishment! That is expected to be professional!! And this was nothing of that sort! My family of 7 walked out and left. 

This is upsetting on the miscommunication and lack of effort on their side who ended up putting the server in the middle!!! The server is not at fault, to me its the damn manager!!!

Fix your customer service. I work in customer service and i worked on every holiday this year. Doesn't give you an excuse. You chose this industry. If you don't like it? Don't work it!!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi joint. My brother was telling about this new place he had tried with a few of his friends. So I decided to see what the hype was about. The food was prepared fresh from our appetizers to our main course everything was delicious! We ordered the meat lovers course which has a little bit of their popular items. Our server was such a delight and friendly."}
{"text":"This is one of my fav lil spots im vegas . Brought a family member from out of town and he absolutely loved it . Had the meat lovers bundle and even though its designed for 2 people , 3 of us had more than enough ."}

{"text":"Great food, friendly service, however , unexpected huge crowd caused  the management panic. It will be fine."}
{"text":"Cooking your own food in front of you is new to me, but I like it. Talk about fresh off the grill. Everything else we ordered (garlic noodles and ramen) was delicious. This place hit the spot for a late dinner."}
{"text":"waiter authetically japanese, tofu and edamame salad so good, love the idea of smores even though we where too full to try, husband loved filet mignon, the happy hour prices are unbelieveably cheap"}
{"text":"Have been to one in LA and didn't think it was that good.  Tried this location in Las Vegas and everything was delicious, service with a smile. Highly recommend!"}
