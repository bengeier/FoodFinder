{"text":"Decoration of this place is not reflective to the quality of the food and service. Food was awful. We order couple of items from the menu and they did not even have the food, so we had to reorder. When the food came it looked and tasted like Burger King quality. Not coming back again. I was really hoping for a good experience and wanted to try the place for long time."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I didn't read reviews before trying this place. Dessert was edible,  but not worth the money paid for it. My wife's crepe was supposed to come with fruit, it MAYBE had 3 strawberries sliced thinly and one banana.  Vanilla ice cream was just plain old vanilla,  nothing extravagant and the crepes were rubbery.  Smoothies se3med like mostly milk and a tad bit if powdered fruit.   My wife and I paid 50 dollars for mediocre dessert.  I feel ripped off."}
{"text":"We went here last night around 8:30 for dessert with a group of friends. It was quiet empty when we arrived, so had seating right away. The server came and took our order in a timely manner. We all ordered different desserts. I placed an order for the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake along with a coffee. My husband ordered a double espresso. I absolutely loved the cheesecake and the coffee was not bad. 
The cheesecake was not overly sweet and just melted in my mouth. The others were also very satisfied with the desserts.
Now the reason why I am giving it a three star is that I have a baby that often needs to be changed. When I went into the lady's washroom, to my surprise there was no change table! I also checked the handicap stall, again no change table. This causes a lot of inconvenience for mothers with young ones. 
I would defiantly love to go back but I can't do it anytime in the near future as it hurts to have to change your baby in your car!"}
{"text":"A delicious yet expensive place to get dessert. Spin is a dessert place that is attached to a mall in Pickering. 

I have been here with my girlfriend on two occasions, I can empathize with some of the other reviewers about the service here! I can understand how the length of time it takes just to get your order can be a little bit long. And yes I believe the employees spend more time socializing with one another than actually attending to customers. 

Other than that problem, the desserts themselves are not bad. We have gotten the crepes before, and although they are good, it is nothing spectacular. An item they have that we thought was amazing though was a hazelnut ice cream which is way better than a typical one you would get elsewhere. 

Overall, other than below average service, you can get a relatively delicious dessert at Spin. But do expect to spend a pretty penny to get it."}
{"text":"This was the worst. My friend and I got seated and waited 20 minutes. No one came to take our orders. Everybody working here on Friday night were about 18-20 years old. They were lost and were doing their own thing. They need an adult there to be a manager for some guidance. After not getting our order taken we left. No Service = No food = No customers!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was empty and the service was  slow. We had to get up and walk to get our server's attention many times. When we finally received our food, the order was incorrect and the server insisted we said a different order. When we finally received the correct order, I  enjoyed every bit. I had a waffle with vanilla icecream, raspberries (strawberries were not available) and chocolate sauce."}
{"text":"We had a great time at the Spin Cafe, and we were able to get a table as soon as we got there (unlike. Our server was Shomari and he did a good job taking care of us. The cake slices are a little pricey and no refills on the coffee but it was still a good experience. I hate the white lighting though, I don't know why anyone thinks that pure white lighting is a good idea. Should be warm and intimate. White light is good for an office or laundry room IMO. 

A friend told me that when they went, Spin's menu didn't mention when an item had nuts. We went recently and they fixed that so all is well."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. If you want to come to a place with the worst food, Spin is the place for you. We had to wait for our food and they only brought out only two out of the 3 dessert plates. By the time the last arrive my friends were already done eating. They forgot my other friends drink. On top of that when it came down to get the bill. We had to ask them 3 times. Mind you they were not busy at all. There were in total of 8 - 10 people with 5 people on staff. I get better service at McDonald's then I did at Spin. The food wasn't that great. I would choose Demetres over Spin. Very similar concept but Demetres is way BETTER!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing! Wish I read the reviews before I dropped $60 here! What a joke...they skimp on the toppings and flavour.. lack lustre which makes this wanna be bootleg Caffe Demetris a definite miss. I guess that explains why on a Saturday during peak time the place was completely deserted!! Was really hoping this would be good, but I think I would've been okay with losing a $50 bill on the street than spending the $$$ here."}
{"text":"I came, I starved and I left.****

If you are unemployed and have no other way to spend your time and want to watch a bunch of newbies struggle to take orders then by all means come here. 

Customer service is by far the worst. To save time and money...just go across the street and order a McFlury."}
{"text":"Long story short, never go to a dessert  restaurant to eat an evening dinner. The dessert was really good, this is why I am giving 3stars.

I brought my wife her for Valentine's Day and we both agreed that the dinner portion was sub-standard and not worth the money $70.00+.

The fish tasted like frozen fish from loblaws. It was dry and the rice was simple and plain.(I could have cooked a better meal at home, And I am not a chief!)

On the contrary however, the dessert was exactly what we expected, \"good and fun\".
I know next time to eat before coming to the restaurant.
Great waiter ($10.00 tip I gave), great atmosphere, very professional but the actual food....... please improve or just serve desserts."}
{"text":"waited 15mins just to be seated when there's like 5 staff galavanting. the place looks elegant and fancy.we have to ask for the menu 2x and still waited 5mins to get one after I asked for the 3rd time and gave the one waiter a look. after waiting another 15mins browsing at expensive menu no one acknowledge us to get our order. gave them another 5mins and we just walked out the place."}
{"text":"No atmosphere.  Extremely over priced.  It really is too bad because I've been waiting for a good dessert place to open up in Pickering.  This isn't it.  

It is so expensive you can't go back for another year."}
{"text":"Good food, but horrible, horrible slow service. First we weren't seated until we asked to be seated, which was fine, but our orders took forever. 2 of the orders were just simple scoops of ice cream. It took over 20 minutes and the restaurant wasn't even near busy, it was near empty. My order took almost another 30 minutes after that. Then our order of iced coffee and tea never arrived. We ended up having to cancel that part of the order because by that time we had been sitting for over an hour. We also asked for napkins that took 5 minutes to get.

When we inquired about the iced coffee and tea, we were told the machine was being cleaned, which is why it was taking so long. By the time we left, it was apparently still being cleaned. How hard is it to make tea? You just need hot water.

I'm not sure how the service was so slow when it wasn't even busy. Waiting over 20 minutes for a few scoops of ice cream is beyond ridiculous."}
{"text":"This review is based on service, atmosphere and only the dessert and tea we had. We were the only ones there so easily we were greeted first thing and attended to. Our server was very nice but the staff would talk very loudly to themselves as though there were no customers there.. they need some proper management.. it's a great concept but not very well executed.

We ordered a London fog latte which was delicious!! a bit sweet but the tea leaves they use at the caf√© give a very strong Earl grey flavor. and we ordered the Thriller. it's an October pumpkin spice special. Pumpkin spice ice cream with white chocolate and nuts and hot caramel sauce on the side served over your choice of crepe or waffle. 

it was delicious!!! the ice cream was so good I wish they would carry it year round!

the place is a good concept but lacks organization and is over priced. still, I'd go back once in a while for a relaxing latte and choice dessert"}
{"text":"At first glance, Spin Cafe seems to be a very elegant place, with intimate lighting, white tables, and soft white chairs. It has a very relaxed and laid back vibe. The servers took that to a whole new level, unfortunately. They were in no hurry to help anybody. I read some of the other reviews while I was there and have to agree, the service is slow. I should have read the reviews before going there.

I ordered the Chicken Pesto Crepe with a Caesar salad on the side. Actually, I wasn't offered a choice of salads. It took a while to arrive and the presentation was a bit boring, not great for photos. I started on the Caesar salad and discovered a salty, soupy mess with equal parts lettuce and croutons. They could have called it a crouton salad.

The first cut into the crepe released a pool of oil. The flavour wasn't bad but I couldn't ignore the oil slick on my plate.

I thought their prices were a little on the high side. Their pastries are purchased from Dufflet.

Lesson learned. Read the reviews BEFORE trying a new restaurant!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I agree with some of the reviews.
Decor is great but the rest is spotty.

We just went in for dessert and coffee (I mean it is a dessert cafe).
Most of their desserts are Dufflet - which is fine, but the prices are really high.
Couldn't get over what it cost for a couple pieces of cake and some coffee!

Also, maybe they are new?  The server seemed quite inexperienced and actually tried to take our plates away before we were finished.  Things like cutlery and sugar didn't come as part of normal service.  We had to ask.  Where does that happen?

Anyway -- the last thing I was not thrilled about was the overwhelming grease smell from the kitchen.
I really am not a fan of smelling of stale grease when I leave a restaurant and I sure did not expect it from a dessert spot.

Needless to say will be giving a big miss to this spot.
Sorry guys!"}
{"text":"Meh.... Just meh.... Wasn't bad but wasn't exactly good either.  Service was slow, inattentive.  Fake oily \"whipped cream\" not real cream.  Place looks ok inside, maybe not appropriate for pickering, looks like it belongs on king west maybe and charges downtown prices to boot.  Counted 6 staff working with only 8 customers on a Friday night so there was really no reason for the lack lustre service.  This chain may work elsewhere in the city but I predict it won't last long here- unless they adjust their prices and get their service on point"}
{"text":"I am not sure , but I am starting to believe this is one of those \"Front \" establishments
We went twice.Their were more employees then customers there.Yet the employees always had their backs turned to you . Were busy having their own social time . and both times when we tried to get their attention  if they look at you they just give you a casual please wait .
My sister was getting aggravated at the long wait just for a server to end their social time .
They make you feel like you are interrupting them .We have been there twice and both times  we saw all together 3 tables just get up and leave because after 10 -15 minutes in a mostly empty cafe no server to ask what you will have . 
Also you getting cream or sweetener proves a challenge with them . We asked for more coffee . Yes I dont care about paying for more coffee I dont think its a free refil but just by asking the server tries to convince  you not to get more coffee because it means it is calling for work .
The atmosphere looks great . It has a good location ... but the servers dont care , dont want to work ,,,,and no adult over 18 there. Or perhaps as one review said is hiding in the back not wanting to talk ....so I highly doubt they care about business . Cant see this lasting long what a shame"}
{"text":"Service was not only slow, but my server seemed so bored to be working that he spoke at a level noone could hear.  We went a couple of weekends ago and the place was clean and inviting.  It was however,  extremely hot.  I am not sure why the heat was cranked up but everyone was sweating...not a good look on a server.  We ordered desert and it was pretty good though nothing special.  There is no reason to go here though as Demetri's is way better!  I can't imagine this place will be around for much longer.  The menu variety is way too expansive, the folks working there dont care about work in at a normal pace, and the deserts aren't near as good as Demetri's.   Its a good location though so hopefully the owner sees the consistency of comments from these reviews and fixes it."}
{"text":"We went 10 days back, ordered a chicken sandwhich, it wasnt good at all, the chicken was processed in rectangular cubes instead of being real chicken, ordered oreao mousse dessert which was very average, and 2 coffees, the bill came to $30 plus, wish we had gone to the food court instead, explains no customers were there. I will give one star for the ambiance, the set up is really nice, but that doesnt help if the product is not good. The server was a very nice helpful young girl !"}
{"text":"If I could give this zero stars I probably would. We waited about 30 minutes to be served the worst breakfast I've ever had at a restaurant. Poached eggs were extremely undercooked and served on probably frozen and terrible crab cakes which I doubt were made on site next to the tiniest salad I've ever seen in my life. The hollandaise sauce I could only compare to a salty mayo?. It was bad. I was actually shocked that the server presented this thinking it was acceptable. The only thing I can say it that the place was nicely decorated. I have never gone to a restaurant and refused to pay but the food at this place was totally gross."}
{"text":"Horrid. I can't even express how horrible my experience was here. I wish I could give it a 0. The first time I went they were out of tea and coffee?! Ok... so things happen... I tried to go back another time and the servers are dressed to impress but their service is horrible! They literally didn't show any care in costumer service and didn't ask once how things were. They just leave you. Give you your food and leave you. We had to even go up to get the bill. Horrible customer service. I was in a great mood that day until I went for dessert here! Never again!"}
{"text":"The place is good for desserts but the food is thrown together to look presentable, and the ideas are good but it's not that tasty.
We had the vindaloo fries. They tasted good. Very filling. I could recommend them.

We also had the \"Hershey Store\" peanut butter chocolate ice cream on a waffle. It was supposed to have mini Reese's Cups on top.... It didnt have any.  We told the waiter and he tried to show us the little crumbs that were somewhere between them melted ice cream. Jokingly we told him we shouldn't have to hunt for it, and to bring us more. He brought us a little tiny container of more powdered substance. When we ate it plain, it turned out it was just crushed Skore toffee. It wasn't even Reese's Peanut Butter Cups!!! We just gave up. We went on a sugar fast for 30 days and this was our reward.....a failed reward. ( See the picture).

Okay I must say for the quality of food you get, it is a bit overpriced. For example mini cake desserts are $10 when you can actually get them at the original Dufflet shop for about $4.  And you pay like $14 for two lightly toasted pieces of bread with grilled chicken and a tasteless smearing of guacamole.

 They had a lot of variety for desserts. A lot of stuff from Dufflet and what they claim to be Cheesecake Factory. 

I would return and recommend for dessert only."}
{"text":"I attended Spin Cafe last night with my girlfriend. We usually go to the one in Vaughan but have been excited for this one to open because it's closer to home!

The cafe is new and just opened so the inside is clean and very modern/fresh. 

They seemed to be short staffed when we went in around 7pm on a Saturday night. The quality of the food was great as expected and matches the product found at the more established Vaughan location. 

I had ordered the Loco on a crepe and my girlfriend ordered the Pistachio Crepe. She has a glass of water and I had a Strawberry Italian Soda(which is served warm) so don't expect it with ice like Second Cup!

The only downfall (and it wasn't very good at all) was the service was EXTREMELY slow and very inattentive. The one server did not know how to split the bill for the table beside us and we waited almost 20 mins for a server to remove our completed plates. 

I think once they get settled in and more comfortable this rating would have increased. 

Regardless, I will return."}
{"text":"The absolute worst cafe to go to. I gave this cafe three tries but every single time has been horrible. 

My crepe was made undercooked.. how do you make an uncooked crepe? Once I told the server she said the boss said I still have to pay for it. I was completely fine with paying (although I took one bite) but I just wanted her to cook it. She claimed there was nothing she could do. I asked to talk to the manager and she told the server to tell me she didn't want to come out and she was too busy to talk. 


My friend was unhappy with her ice cream because it had that frost on top like it was sitting there for a long time in the freezer. The cakes were also not fresh m


I don't recommend this cafe at all!"}
{"text":"I am very sorry to the owner of this place, but this dessert spot is not good. The place looks good and has comfy chairs and I appreciate you bringing a dessert spot to my area, but unfortunately... I am not a fan at all.

I'll start with the good, the servers were friendly enough. 

Now, what can be improved is the food and dessert. The cakes are not fresh as the server mentioned they are brought in from Cheesecake Factory and I think the pizza is the frozen grocery store kind but I can give a pass on the pizza since this is a dessert place. It looks like the only fresh made desert would be waffles since I saw a bunch of waffle irons by the cake display.

I definately like what they are trying to do but I just didn't enjoy my experience here."}
{"text":"I was at this Cafe on Saturday February 10th at around 12pm.

After being seated, and ordering a few coffees, we were asked if we'd like anything to eat. We all respectfully declined, as we were satisfied with our drinks. 
Shorty after this the waitress approached our table, and let us know that there is a 1 hour time limit on your group tables and we would have to leave. And according to her, it was your cafe's policy. Personally I feel this practice is INCREDIBLY rude and goes against all customer service principles, however, I can understand this policy if there are people waiting for tables. On THIS particular day your cafe was COMPLETELY EMPTY. The 4 of us were literally the ONLY customers at your establishment. In addition to that, we had just been hit with a huge Snow storm, and there weren't many people out and about anyways.

After feeling incredibly offended and frankly like we were being kicked out of your cafe, your waitress made a point to not only interrupt my business meeting 2 MORE TIMES, she also asked us to LEAVE. I have not experienced such horrible treatment of a customer in any food or beverage establishment in my life. 

I'm never coming back here again. I wouldn't encourage anyone to visit this place either. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE treatment of Customers."}
