{"text":"The food is very average and the only reason they got an A-OK is because they understand that and their prices are accordingly.   Their lunch buffet is quite cheap. I went with their non-veg thali but I didn't know they will pick the stuff from the buffet anyways or else I would have gone with the buffet. All the different dishes I tired were very blend and just average. There are a lot of other joints in the area but for you dont have other options then this would be your place for some cheap Indian buffet.   For my Muslim peeps! This area is common to serve halal meat and as per the server/ owner they serve halal meat at this location."}
{"text":"BEST BEST ****Chicken tikkah masala****   This is a hole in the wall place in little India. They don't have the best service if you get the grumpy lady, it's not fancy and the signs are signs have spelling mistakes. But they make a mean spicy tikkah and warm buttery naan. I order for pick up and enjoy it at home. This is my go to spot any day !!!   I wasn't sure if I was the only one who thinks this dish is spectacular so I randomly get my friend to try it and they agree. I don't say anything and just wait for the reaction...their faces light up.   So this elderly turban uncle took my order.  He made my food and came out to give my food and took my payment. He makes up for the other lame staff.  I complimented his dish and he said his makes better dishes them him!!! I was wondering where he was ... Can it really get better than this ?????????     Love,   Satisfied taste buds :)"}
{"text":"aka: Large Indian Buffet  My sister recommended trying this small mom & pop shop out. They offer under 20ish buffet items (butter chicken, tandoori chicken, aloo gobi, naan bread, basmati rice) and many other vegetarian dishes. It's buffet style so upon arrival you'd seat yourself, grab a plate, and proceed to get your food.  I was quite impressed with the variety of dishes as well as the authentic flavourful taste! They're really good with replenishing dishes so the food is consistently hot. I would definitely suggest trying this place out!  Meat buffet is $10.99 - veggie buffet is $7.99, you can also purchase pop for $1 and other juices"}
