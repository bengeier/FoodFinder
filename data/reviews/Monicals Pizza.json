{"text":"Pizza is tasty! Thin or pan crust. It is a great value as a pleaser which includes salad and drink. Locally owned and operated in a small town, they have more than pizza. We enjoy the friendly service."}
{"text":"This is actually a Monical's now, not Pizza Man anymore, though run by the same family.

If you're not from around these parts (or anywhere near St. Louis), then you probably haven't had St. Louis style pizza. It is by far my favorite kind of pizza and can't be found anywhere other than within a three hour radius of St. Louis. It's thin crust without being crunchy like a cracker. It's crisp enough to hold up to toppings and cut into small squares for easy enjoyment.

The red salad dressing (sort of a cross between French and Catalina) was such a hit that they now bottle and sell it at the stores. It's especially tasty with the pizza dipped in it a bit. 

The bread sticks are also some of the best- easily better than anything the major chains sell, though they aren't covered in cheese, oil and butter. You get dipping sauces for them. The Russian sub is also good.

I always make sure I get some tasty Monical's at least twice when I'm back home. Too bad they won't expand into the rest of the country."}
{"text":"The sausage and mushroom pizza were excellent and the bread sticks with marinara were good and the staff at this place were excellent and the service was good. I will be retuning there again soon."}
{"text":"While it will always be \"pizza man\" in my heart,  the now monicals pizza is everything you would expect from the best name in pizza. 

Don't fool yourself if you have never had monicals ... this is no domino's or pizza Hut swill... this is top notch near perfection food. 

Thin crust extra crispy with some monicals dressing just simply cannot be beat. 

Sure it costs more than,  say,  little Caesars,  but give it one chance and you will see why!"}
{"text":"Just to clarify the other person's post.  Monical's pizza is NOT, I repeat, NOT St. Louis style pizza.  Folks in St. Louis put Provel Cheese on their pizza (essentially a Velveeta-ish pasteurized, processed, cheeze that's a mixture of provolone and mozzarella.  Google it.  It's GROSS).  Monical's uses 100 % real mozzarella!  It's definitely a Central Illinois thing - especially the red French dressing!  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it's so darned expensive.  But again, ST. LOUIS STYLE PIZZA IT IS NOT!  :)"}
