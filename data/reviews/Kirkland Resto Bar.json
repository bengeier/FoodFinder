{"text":"Great new casual pub style place. A bit hidden and tough to find but worth the search(it's next to the McDonalds and physio place)   Burger was amazing. Not over cooked, fresh. Fries excellent! We had the calamari to start and it was perfect. Could have used a little more of the spicy mayo but didn't ask. My companion had fish and chips and it was also excellent.   Excellent beer selection. Some micro brews and mainstream stuff.   Service top notch. Owner seems to be interested in making sure you enjoy your time and food.   Good place to watch a hockey game too. The place isn't huge and has good tv views.   I'd say this is my new favorite local place."}
{"text":"very pretty place. trendy hipster inside, but we stayed outside on the terasse which was really nice, everything was wood themed, so it felt like it was up at a cottage or something, but it was trendy and very modern.   We went just for drinks, and it turns out you have to order food at least once when you order alchohol, which was a little strange, but they at least had a little side menu for drinkers, where we can order something real cheap for just 2-3$ to just show that we did order food, and get as many drinks as we want. To my surprize, the food was actually amazing lol  We had both ordered the samosa each off the mini menu. it came just as one samosa for one order, with a side of coleslaw that seemed fresh and springy, with various veggies in it instead of only cabbage like most places, it was good too. The Samosa was surprizingly great. Crispy outside, and spicy on the inside  I was very surprized about this actually, because alot of real indian restaurants i go to always serve all their traditional food dishes really bland because they're afraid to offend my borring canadian white girl taste pallet lol so i usually hate restaurants in general because they never serve up anything with flavor. But these samosas were yum, and what surprized me was that it was a hipster joint lol no indian insight ?! well ok then lol maybe they're hiding one in the kitchen lol But now I'm deffinetely curious to try the other indian types of food on their menu, they have curry and naan? I bet it's good. And beed rolls too lol I'm happy I wouldn't have to be stuck with lamb, I hate eating dead babies x.x I'd rather mutton lol but happy with beef!  I was surprized to see curry dishes on their menu, because the rest of the food seemed like regular white people food, like club sandwiches, fries, etc. I know it's taboo to put two different styles of food in the same restaurant, but I think that's very convinient, because for example, I love spicy foreign food, but I have friends who can't stand it, so we have a hard time picking a place out, so somewhere like here would be great.  Their alcohol menu was interesting. Instead of coronas, they had Sol's which was what we got with tequila shots that was not listed on the menu. I got to try tequila gold for the first time, was nice and smooth  The rest of their drink menu looked very interesting actually, but unfortunately it wasn't that kind of night for us xp We still had a really nice time, and we didn't have to go on the street to go smoke lol there was a place out in back that was far enough, so it was great, for summer anyways lol  This place is technically not even in Kirkland... it's address is in pierrefonds lol I was very proud to see a restaurant named Kirkland that I thought was in Kirkland lol god dammit... what a disapointment lol Now I'm going to wonder why they named it Kirkland? lol is it because they're very close to kirkland? or... do they use alot of Kirkland Signature items there? lol  I'd personally love to return here, but I'm having a hard time dragging anyone else to. I don't know why, but they seem put off by it, eventhough they've never heard of it or tried it before. I have a bad feeling that people just hate kirkland in general lol which bugs me, cause i live here lol and it's the best city in montreal, we officially blocked the ban on pitbulls here, love us! lol"}
{"text":"Finally, a pub style bar and grill in Kirkland! This is long overdue. The menu has a good selection of Canadian classics (e.g. Poutine) and British favourites (e.g. Butter Chicken). There is also a good selection of beer on tap. A great place for lunch or dinner."}
