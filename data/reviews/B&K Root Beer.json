{"text":"Great little local drive-in, with a couple of picnic tables if you don't feel like having to get the kraut smell out of your car later.  Food is pretty basic - hot dogs with a variety of toppings (cheese, beans, \"coney\", kraut), french fries or jo jos, onion rings, etc.  Occasionally they have hamburgers, but I think it's only one night a week.  Their menu advertises some kind of air-fryer thing that means less fat, but come on - if I'm ordering a hot dog and onion rings for dinner I'm not really thinking about the fat content!  Anyway, that doesn't really matter, because really what you're coming here for is the root beer.  They make their own, and serve it in a frosty mug, and it is delicious.  Better than A&W.  And you can get a larger amount to take home too, although be forewarned that it does not keep its fizz very well in the jugs that they use.  Is it my favorite root beer ever?  No, I tend to prefer the spicier (less sweet) varieties, if I'm going to be picky about it.  But it is darn good, and it is local, and our waitress was very nice, and so I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great, classic drive in! Seasonal, so get here by 9/24/16 for amazing root beer and coneys. Cash and CREDIT accepted now as of 4/13/17. Car hops are friendly and service is fast. (Lights for service) 

Sunday's are discount coney dig day! Plus you can take sauce home for your own cook outs. 

I've been coming here for 40+ years and it's an institution. Get a coney with sauce and onions with a big mug of root beer brewed by them!!!"}
{"text":"Ok just tried the coneys here at this B&K they are not  the same as the coneys at the B&K in Akron on 93 and wilbeth rd... This sauce is much sweeter ... Its good just not even close as good as the other place .... Of course I'm biased I grew up with the one in Akron and you all should try and compare ..."}
{"text":"We read the article in the Beacon Journal a few months ago and we wanted to try it. We were not very impressed to say the least. The \"jumbo\" beef hot dog was not really jumbo in size. The onion rings were very greasy and flavorless. The breaded mushrooms were ok,  On the brighter side, everything came out to the table hot! Oh, and the home made root beer was just ok."}
{"text":"Weather makes things questionable I get that. Two weeks in a row, they have closed early and the weather has been fine. I messaged the business on Facebook and expressed my disappointment and stated I would have to choose another dinner location again this week. My response from the owner was \"ok, thanks\". Disappointed in their lack of customer service as new owners."}
{"text":"$29 for a family of five, That's not bad. I really like this root beer. It's not that other Root Beer, it's different and that's good! Plus it's only $2 for a Tall Cold One! Kids enjoyed their soft pretzels, all beef hotdogs are good and we liked the fried mushrooms."}
{"text":"Great food ! ! ! I have to admit though that I don't stray far from the Kraut Dogs, or Cony Dog. My wife loves the Sloppy Joe, or Cony dog, she also often gets the Cream Cheese Poppers. While here we many times have to take a gallon of Root Beer home. Our Granddaughter loves root beer and last time w"}
{"text":"I haven't been back since while I ate I watched an old man sitting outside chopping onions--a HUGE pile--all while he coughed and coughed and coughed, all over his hands, all over the huge pile of onions. So incredibly disgusting."}
{"text":"This place is so-so.  If you're just interested in someplace in the neighborhood, go ahead and stop. If you don't mind driving a few extra minutes, go to Swensons instead."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick refreshment. Service was fast and this place defiantly won't break the bank. We ordered some root beer floats to go. Overall, nothing immediately makes their root beer floats stand out from any other place except the root beer is really creamy. Would stop here again if I was in the area"}
{"text":"The place was so personal when I went there. The people were so nice, and it's just this small little place. The prices were amazing, however the quantity of food they give you is not a lot, so if you're hungry better order a lot."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait for opening day. The service is great as is the friendliness. The hamburgers are so good..the fries are much better now that the new owners took over. Coneys are better than A&W. Root beer delicious! I love that it's a locally owned drive up restaurant. I'd recommend B&K always!"}
{"text":"Cool old school drive-in. Grew up in the area and for some reason I've never checked this place out. Moved back after years away and rediscovered this place. 

It's a great little business that makes exactly what you would expect from a drive in. The coney dog was excellent as well as the root beer. The hamburger wasn't what I expected. It was more of a homemade burger that you would get from a backyard barbecue which was a nice change. It was  much bigger than I expected (should have gotten a single) and was cooked well. 

They do take credit card so it helps as I never have cash. The waitress was awesome and the time from ordering to actually getting the food was short. Couldn't ask anything more from a local drive-in. I definitely recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Best Root Beer around- it's fresh and homemade. Their food is definitely typical fast food and is a little on the small side, but the pretty reasonable prices make it possible to buy a lot!"}
