{"text":"Not a very good experience tonight.  We had to send a burger back twice and to top it off the manager complained about the \"POS\" system as if to blame the undercooked burger on that instead of the cooks.   The service was very good but the burger was enough for us to consider not visiting again."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and had a great experience.  The staff was very friendly and the food was great.  They are in the process of changing the menu and we had new items. Had the crab cake BLT, soft pretzel sticks with real deli mustard, BBQ potato skins and we sampled the pimento cheese.  All the food was fantastic!   Good drink specials too. Can't wait for spring so we can hang on the patio."}
{"text":"I have only Eaten once but it was really good. The waitress was really nice and the food was tasty. I had Wings and a side order of fries and my friend got the black bean burger * i could wrong on the name* The wings were nice and they were not baby wings and the sauce i they used was good. it was the average wing sauce that everyone serves. The burger was great though. it was like eating chili in a burger form. The atmosphere is great here the the staff does not bother you. I could say if your in the area and want something a little different then give thise a shot"}
{"text":"We had a very nice time at Flip Flops.  The waitress was fun and sociable and the ambiance was something the kids could get into.  The food was fine; I had a shrimp po boy and it was tasty (AND a bit big, had to deconstruct it to eat it!)  We'd probably go back when we're looking for something casual and easy-going for dinner.  It sure beats the likes of O'Charleys and Applebees!"}
{"text":"This is a simple little restaurant, with a pretty simple menu consisting of mostly salads, sandwiches and hot dogs. The decorating was a collection of everything from Bob Marley to Frank Sinatra posters to knick knacks of golf, concerts, etc. As the restaurant name implies, the place has a relaxed \"flip flops\" welcome feel. 

Food. We opted for the chili-cheese fries since our sandwiches were going to come with chips.  A simple Grilled Cheese ($2.99) sounded good to me and the lady friend got the BLT ($3.99). Both sandwiches were served on texas toast and were satisfying. For some reason, our meals ended up with fries instead of chips after all.   

i had a Landsharks draft for $2.50 (14 ounces). They had a few other draft beers and a standard selection of bottled beer. 

The thing that attracted us to check it out was the patio area, unfortunately by the time we got there the wind/storm threat had picked up so we were forced inside. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant! My husband ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with fries and I ordered the BBQ sandwich! Both were great! The BBQ sandwich has this homemade Cole slaw on it that was very tasty! They were playing great music! Great atmosphere! Great service!! We didn't order any alcohol but looks like they have good drink specials as well. Menu had anything from BBQ, salads, chicken sandwiches, hotdogs, etc."}
