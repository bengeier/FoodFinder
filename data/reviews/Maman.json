{"text":"This place is an oasis in the busy FCP food court.they have their own enclosed seating area. They have excellent quiches, salads and baked goods. Try their chocolate chip cookies. Full service espresso bar and patio in the summer."}
{"text":"Love their pastries, tarts and cakes. Not too sweet stuff, always fresh and tasty.    My complain: Their customer service sucks!! I was there today, and two of their male staff were around but they didn't even care to look at me! I was standing just in front of them and it took them 3-4 minutes to come forward and take my order!! And just to clarify no other customer was there. The same thing happened last time I was there as well. It seems that their stuff is too good that they don't even bother to fully respect their customers!  Well, you deserve a 3-star for that!!"}
{"text":"Would not recommend the Saturday brunch to anyone - recommend only for tea/coffee and treats.  Went for brunch last Saturday afternoon... what a let down! The venue itself is very small, but nicely decorated and very rustic. Service was lacking and food took a long time to be served. When food arrived it was mediocre and we had to send some dishes back as they were missing ingredients... not a good first impression. For a restaurant that can only seat a maximum of twenty or so people, I find it hard to fathom how these mistakes are made! Servers brought over a complimentary tiramisu to make up for our experience. Overall, I would definitely not be in a rush back here... there are PLENTY of other cafe/bakeries that deliver impeccable service and quality EVERY time (*cough* NADEGE *cough*)."}
{"text":"happened to find this place last year when i was here working the weekend (last fall) brunch on a sunday. i was most impress with the very fine details of the flatware and plates they were sparkling and gleaming  totally flawless . staff services  was very attentive and chef sab (i believe) from paris was there to see everyone was happy. i went back awhile ago twice ,once for lunch. i 1st had to go to the washroom there i ran into a black women (staff) she became complaining to me about how we people here in canada are so rude and dirty ! she then went in a side door that was jarred open speaking in french  on her cell complaining about management and cooking staff saying they are not even french! they know nothing! they treat us like we are slaves it went on for some time ! i later after taking note to return for brunch ..it was very bad..water marks on pates and silver ..glasswear was dirty ..staff were rather overwhemled ..down hill!!! and staff complaining where we could all hear them ..not a happy place to work i guess? please find a place out of the public ear!!!"}
{"text":"The decor and atmosphere will keep me coming back to Maman, but the dry hard blueberry lavender loaf won't be see me again."}
{"text":"Chocolate chip cookie is heavenly. I believe some magazine quoted it as a must try before you die. It definitely is! I don't know how they do it but it had just the right consistency of crunchy exterior and gooey melty chocolate interior. I hate super sweet cookies and this cookie was perfect and didn't make me feel like I ate a pound of pure sugar.   Sandwiches here are pretty good. I come back for them because I really like the fresh bread they use. They fillings are so-so. The Pierette sandwich (ham, comte cheese, cornichons, butter) had a very delicate flavor and the bread really stood out. The Seb sandwich (roast beef, caramelised onions, greens, whole grain mustard) I didn't care for. The mustard was super overpowering and I basically had to scrape it off the sandwich. The roast beef was pretty flavourless. The best part was the carmalised onions which there was not enough of.   I tried their pistachio loaf and lemonade. The pistachio loaf was really dense and a bit on the dry side. It also looked like it hadn't been mixed properly? Lemonade was good, slightly sweetened with a hint of lavendar. Not sure it was worth the $4 though.  Didn't try the croissants but they looked overbaked and dry.   Can't say I'm wowed but I'd come back for the chocolate cookies for sure! That and the bread."}
{"text":"Having been warned of the lineup at lunch, my party arrived before 11:45. There was just a short line, about 3 people deep, and plenty of seats inside and on the patio. Service can be more organized. We gave our orders to a girl who got most of the things and handed them to the person manning the cash. He had to get the things the girl left out and also make our coffee. There's no tray so ask for your food to go if you're ordering many items so they'll pack it in a bag for you.   On to the good stuff - I love how they styled the interior! The patio is gorgeous as well with fresh hydrangeas on every table. Their cups are too cute!!   We ordered an assortment of their sweets and a croque madam. Everything was good although the canelé was a little chewy. The bread for the sandwich was delicious and my Americano was lovely! The strawberry tart was super fresh! I can't say their croissants are the best as I have had comparable ones elsewhere.   Will have to go back to try their soups and pasta. They now have a cocktail bar too!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really did.   I came here for an afternoon treat. First of all, like with everything else in PATH, it took me forever to find this cafe. Turns out it's on the second floor, west side of the First Canadian Place food court, looks quaint, like catnip for Instagrammers.   Baked goods wise they had croissants that looked very oily and the cakes which seemed too dense so I just ordered a cappuccino. The server did not seem interested in my presence.  The cappuccino I received had a big heap of milk froth on top of it, not a good sign. I took a sip and threw it out, it was that bad.   Back to Sam James I went to get a coffee worth the price. Two stars for the decor and because I feel guilty judging this cafe based on their coffee alone."}
{"text":"Ordered the lavender blueberry loaf but got lemon poppeyseed one, very stale. Madeleine was dry. Canele was ok, but the outside was too soft. Cappuccino was nothing special. For a place that has such beautiful decor and charges prices like that, they should offer better food."}
{"text":"It is like entering a French country home - greeted by appetizing food cooked by \"Maman\". It is also a relaxing place to escape for lunch or coffee break from the hectic of financial district. The cakes are the winner but everything is tasteful and well presented. A great place to host a private event too!"}
{"text":"Best place on Earth according to me: wonderful quiches and salads, and don't get me started on their Croque-Maman. It is a MUST. Feel like home in France anytime I go, staff is amazing and the place looks great. I love eating on their private patio when the sun is out."}
{"text":"Very snobby. Had lunch with a friend here today. I bought a sandwich for lunch and she bought a dessert. We ate on the patio and although we were both paying customers, we were asked to leave because my friend had a salad from a competitor outside of Maman. I didn't even get a chance to finish my lunch (that i purchased at Maman). When we explained to the waiter and showed him what we had just purchased from Maman he said he didn't care and told us to leave. It was very rude and unprofessional. I will not be dining here again and will recommend to my colleagues to not bother giving them their business."}
{"text":"You really gotto try here!"}
{"text":"Went to brunch with my partner on Saturday July 16th. The place has a nice bistro vibe. Although the sign at the entrance says \"wait to be seated\" no one really seated us. We were asked to sit either inside or in the patio - there was no welcome or greeting - just a mere glance. We opted to sit in the patio. The place was barely occupied except for three tables. There were two servers on the floor.   I ordered chicken club with hard-boiled egg, avocado, red cabbage, tomatoes \"à la Provençale\", bacon & spicy mayo and my partner ordered peal bacon sandwich with caramelized onions & sunny side-up egg on brioche bread. The server we had very limited knowledge of the menu. Chicken club was average - the chicken lacked any flavor. There was no Provençale taste in this dish. The accompanying salad was poorly dressed and had thick layers of unmixed salad dressing. Peal bacon sandwich was okay but nothing special.   Although it wasn't a busy time,  the service we received was poor and spotty. My latte was served without a spoon or sugar and had to ask twice for sugar and a spoon. We got two water glasses - one with a lemon slice and one without. I wondered if the server at least checked what she is serving because I didn't ask without lemon. Our meals were served without any cutlery. I also order a piece of pistachio cake from the bakery counter.  The server was not at all interested in describing the cake - rather she pointed at the label on the display case. The cake was moist and the icing was just fine; however,  the cake crust was slightly burnt. I can accept this level of customer service if there was a long line of customers at the bakery counter - but there was no one waiting for service besides me.   So overall the service was rather poor. Maman is located in a food court in the financial district but I expected better service and products given that their prices are higher than normal food court prices."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place after reading about it in blogto. I went there during lunch and the place was packed. In spite of the crowd I was served pretty quickly. I got the pain au chocolate and Maman's famous nutty chocolate chunk cookie. Both were DELICIOUS! The cookie is packed with chocolate chips, macadamia nuts, walnuts and almonds. I'm not a fan of nuts in cookies but I will definitely be back for this decadent baby. The pain au chocolate was easily the best I've had in Toronto so far and came a solid second behind some of the amazing ones I had while visiting Paris. All in all, excellent experience and will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I give it 4 stars for atmosphere, vibe, coffee and their desserts. 2.5 star for their lunch sandwiches. The egg salad sandwich had sand? In it. Maybe their attempt to be rustic? The croque monsieur was too dry.  Great place to hangout but stick to their coffee and sweets is your best bet. Check out their outdoor patio in the summer. Great escape in the urban jungle."}
{"text":"what an adorable find in the most unexpected of places! my husband brought me here to grab a drink before dinner, and I have to say it was definitely the highlight of my night. the cocktails here are extremely well crafted and I'm just going to say it - among the best I have had in the city. right up there with Bar Isabel, where the bartenders are nothing short of magicians. we also got the smoked cod, cauliflower and aged cheddar, and ricotta with dill pinchos (tapas served on a piece of crusty bread) - which were the perfect accompaniment to our perfect cocktails.   maman is located right in the heart of the financial district and accessible through PATH, so it gets very busy at lunch. this is how my husband discovered it in the first place when he grabbed some quiche and coffee from there one day. lunch or drinks, you're going to fall in love in place!!! it's the cutest."}
{"text":"VERY VERY slow service. Went around 8:30AM. Only 2 people in front who ordered coffee (americano and cappuccino). Took almost 10 minutes to take their orders. Finally received double espresso. The coffee was very sour (some like that flavour profile, I don't) and gritty (beans too finely ground). I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Now, I've never been to France, but stepping into Maman is what I imagine it would be like to step into a cozy cafe in Provence. The decor is totally shabby chic with beautiful tile work, reclaimed wood, vintage furniture, and ceramic rabbits (everywhere!)  For the food, I've mostly come here for coffee and viennoiseries. The coffee is decent, but nothing to write home about. The almond croissant, on the other hand... Maman has quite possibly the best almond croissant I've had in Toronto - and I've had many. The pastry is the perfect balance of crisp, flaky, and tender and the almond creme is on point.  Not sure I'd come back for the coffee, but I'd definitely come back for the pastries =)"}
{"text":"Rustic French decor, outdoor patio, and delicious pastries on point. An instagramers paradise. That being said confusion and blank stares from staff. Two entrances not clearly marking where to order. All that in mind staff was friendly and helpful. Coffee was handed in a white cup; not consistent with branding given they had their trademark blue cups stacked in the background on display.  Ordered: Americano and a butter croissant. Coffee was average. Croissant flaky not too greasy- delish! I hear their chocolate chip cookies are legendary. I'll be back. Maybe the French charm will win me over.  Open Mon - Fri 7-6"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, over price based on the portion. Few items were sold out. At least, the service is ok."}
{"text":"I'm such a sucker for packaging.  This place is adorbs. Check out that fake bistro-patio look! Look at the white porcelain bunny vase with fresh flowers sticking out its ears! Check out the blue floral dishes and sticker on the package! Check out the seemingly worn-in, warm communal dining table! Check out my indiscriminate usage of exclamation marks!...!!   Now, beyond the pretty package: This is pretty much strictly a casual lunch place.  The menu isn't very extensive and you're limited to essential bakery goods.  As long as you're down for bistro fare like a sandwich, quiche, or salad, you're OK.  Expect hot foods and you'll want to search elsewhere.    I opted for the croque Maman, which is essentially a croque monsieur - a sandwich of ham, housemade bechamel, then smothered in melted cheese.  Served warm, it's one of the only warm-ish foods you can get other than the quiche.    I felt my sandwich and the quiche were both OK, but a French colleague of mine felt that the bread in her sandwich was stale and that the quiche had too much of the other ingredients in it to really enjoy the egg flavour.  If you plan to give Maman a try, aim for a time outside of the 12:00-1:00pm crazy rush.  The lineup is lonnnnnggggg."}
{"text":"Went here on Tuesday, July 19 at 1145 am with my brother as it was the anniversary of our mothers death. I got a drink and a chicken Dijon baguette. The baguette which was over $9 with taxes, was not as good as other items I've had there before. And would recommend going to brioche doree for better options. I meant to go back in and get us chocolate cookies when we were done as they're actually amazing. However we were sitting on their patio and got kicked off. My brother was eating a burrito bowl due to dietary restrictions and we sat at the far table away from everyone. The short stubby guy came out after we had been there fifteen minutes and told us to leave immediately in a very rude manner due to my brother not having purchased from there. I myself being a paying customer didn't understand why he was making a big deal considering there were many seats left and no one was looking at us. I highly doubt anyone would have dropped their Maman products to run for a burrito bowl because they saw him eating one. He didn't even say sorry that he was asking and instead stood there until we gathered ourselves to go. We both work in the financial district and will be sure to tell coworkers to not come here based on management and their inability to assess scenarios properly. Their patio is cut off by the rest of the food court by a plant. It would be like going to Starbucks patio. I know it's within their right to ask us to leave but halfway through our meal and in the middle of a serious and emotional conversation was NOT the time. Have some decency and stop being so uptight. Will not long support this establishment and their lack of customer service."}
{"text":"The indoor ambience is sweet and cute, the outdoor patio very relaxing and quaint. I had a chocolate chip nut cookie, it was yummy. Great spot for a coffee chat or business meet up. It's a nice option over your local franchise coffee shop. I loved working out on the patio for a couple of hours between meetings - yay for patio wifi!  I've only visited once but it wasn't super crowded and busy, plenty of tables available."}
{"text":"Cute cafe with nice ambiance. It's located in the corner of the second floor food court in the First Canadian Place building. Although it's a bit pricey their coffee and teas are quite good. I haven't tried their food but it's a nice place to just go and chat with your friends over a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"This place is good....only if money is not an issue for you.  I ordered a single serving of their  caesaria salad which is their version of a Caesar salad made with chicken, kale, Parmesan, onions and croutons.  The ingredients used is top notch and the combination of it makes it one of the better kale Caesar salads I have had in the city.   As you can see from my photos, the serving portion is small basically consisting of 4 small pieces of chicken, about 6 leaves of kale, and then a handful of croutons with the onions and cheese. Sadly, it was done within a few bites.  Even though I was craving for more, my major issue is that this cost me a total of $7.91!   For that price I can get a full salad with all the fixings that will leave me satisfied and not feel like I was robbed.   There is an option to get double the serving for their salads but that comes at almost double the cost.  As I mentioned if money is not an issue or if work is paying for your lunch, then this is a good option. Otherwise I would pass as there are many other choices within the area at a fraction of a cost that leaves you full."}
{"text":"Their food is delicious, but my favourite order here is the lavender hot chocolate!"}
{"text":"I'd give this place 5 stars on their decor alone. It has the cutest French country feel and I love every plate, flower, picture frame, chair, etc in there. Even the way they wrap their baguettes is perfection.  Then I ate their food - wow. The pistachio bun was so good and went great with the cortado. The jambon baguette sandwich was so similar to ones I had in Paris. But the star of the meal was the lavender hot chocolate. I am not a hot chocolate fan but this drink made me a believer. A taste like no other drink I've had before. It is definitely a must-try.  Bonus: outdoor terrace facing the financial district"}
{"text":"I've been here several times! The hot chocolate is super delicious (and super hot, be careful). The matcha latte is smooth and made with almond milk.   I expected more from the pain au chocolat, and I think I've had better chocolate croissants at other places, like Duo. Even Starbucks' chocolate croissant served warm seemed better.  Specialty drinks come in one size only."}
{"text":"Love this place! I was introduced to this cafe by my sister-in-law and I was a bit skeptical at first but everything was delicious. First of all - it was a bit hard to find. We walked around for about 25 minutes before we found it tucked away at the end of the food court.  When we got there, the outside is completely different from the inside. Beautiful decor and presentation of the yummy desserts. We had the following... 1) Blueberry and White chocolate lavender loaf 2) strawberry tart 3) lavender hot chocolate 4)egg and asparagus sandwich 5) pesto zucchini noodles  All of the food was pretty good except the pesto pasta was a bit under seasoned. The desserts and hot chocolate were amazing! I don't like desserts that are too sweet so this was just the right amount! I definitely recommend all of the loafs and sandwiches but salads were definitely lacking flavour."}
{"text":"I believe this used to be Schezuan restaurant now made into this beautiful and quaint Parisian bakery.   I guess if you get there at 5:30 there won't be very many options left since the place closes at 6 pm.   None the less grabbed a quick presses cherry drink and the Salmon hamburger which was delicious. The bun was really good which is a strange point to note but it must have been that good that I literally stopped to look at it as though to double check what goodness I had just put in my mouth. The cherry press juice is a bit fizzy which I was not expecting but flavour wise it was average. My friend said her English Apple was amazing though.   Total cost me $13 so not too bad.   Wish I had the chance to try the pistachio baked goodies of almond croissant but alas will have to come back and try it next time."}
{"text":"Very cute decor, well lit with lots of space to do work at the communal tables. I had a brewed coffee and pineapple cake - both were good but not super extraordinary.  I went closer in the evening so it wasn't busy at all. I wonder if it would have been too noisy to work in during peak hour since it is in the First Canadian Place."}
{"text":"Still love their white chocolate blueberry lavender cake. Service definitely needs to improve! The staff just looked indifferent. Don't think I will return if their attitude remains the same."}
{"text":"Went to Maman again today and what a disappointment. Staff is totally uncaring and it feels like you're bothering them more than anything, and prices have skyrocketed. Quality of food is still good, however my quiche was not warmed enough and you could tell the waitress had other things to talk about with her co-worker than the quality of service. Congrats guys, you've managed to achieve Parisian level experience: high price and uncaring waiters."}
{"text":"This review applies to the take out dessert I have tried so far. First off its a welcome relief for the people who have access to the PATH network. There is a dearth of decent dessert spots so this one is a welcome relief. The setup is nice and if their desserts a precursor I will be here for brunch. On the couple of take outs I tried the Pistachio pound cake which was just right. Nice moist and healthy dose of pistachio (was luved by all the guests) Orange was OK. The benchmark for moi croissant was decent as well. Unfortunately the cappuccino was forgetful.  A good addition to the PATH I will revisit for brunch and update."}
{"text":"So decided to go out of my way to find this place. Was greeted by an associate assuming I wanted coffee, ordered the lavender hot chocolate and frankly it's nothing to rave about. Lacked the taste in lavender and tastes like regular hot chocolate. Won't be back. Lacks service and ambient."}
{"text":"croque maman + a slice of pistachio cake (and sometimes a chocolate chip cookie to save for later) is my idea of a great lunch.  a little on the pricey side and they sometimes over bake my sandwich - but the flavours?...oh so goood :)"}
{"text":"Love at first sight. Such an adorable interior with a clean and cozy atmosphere. French server seems friendly. There is a small variety of baked goods but I highly suggest the loaves - especially the pistachio loaf."}
{"text":"Cute little shop with long tables inside a shopping mall. Delicious iced matcha green tea and pistachio bread. All the pastries look amazing.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came for a cup of coffee. They had the Pistachio Loaf to sample. Not impressed, offering burnt pieces which was tough to chew. I don't know, I prefer my loaves to be light and fluffy.... I ordered the Mocha coffee, it was very weak. It was more cocoa with very weak coffee. The decor was very feminin, country style quaint."}
{"text":"Saturday Brunch (Out of 5) Food: 3 Service: 3 Atmosphere: 5  1) Matcha latte: really rich and tasty, I recommend it!  2) Oeufs a la coque with salmon finger toast: nothing special about this at all, order something else.  3) Croque 'maman': would recommend to share this dish because it super rich and heavy. I felt like all i could taste was the bechamel sauce because there was so much of it and it also made the bread a bit soggy in between.    4) Matcha green tea pancakes: a bit on the dry side and not much matcha flavour, looks really good but tastes so-so.  Overall: the atmosphere definitely gets top marks and it sure is a great place for getting some good food snaps for Instagram. It can feel kind of cramped with the communal tables. I was sitting in between two strangers and was almost touching the both of them on each side.   Service wise, they're not exactly the friendliest or warmest bunch of servers but also not terrible, except one younger girl with glasses, she was very sweet!   Overall the brunch was just ok, probably would just come for their pastries and lattes next time."}
{"text":"Oh so lo-ver-ly!   This is a quality coffee shop and bakery import from NYC. It's very busy during the workweek, but don't fret as things move quite quickly.   Try the white chocolate lavender blueberry loaf for a unique and rich treat!"}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to pop into Maman today. Here's my review:  Service: 2 out of 5. As another yelper stated, service is indifferent. I hate when I'm made to feel that I am bothering staff when placing an order. A smile or genuine hello goes a long way!  Food: 3 out of 5. Our initial order was a croque Maman to share. It was absolutely disgusting. The bread was so soggy from the bechemel sauce that we ended up throwing out the sandwich. I went back and ordered a salad with kale and quinoa and a slice of pistachio cake..both were delicious! Also coffee was fabulous!  Atmosphere: 5 out of 5. We sat outside. Loved the patio!   I'll definitely try it again. Hopefully staff receives some customer service training!"}
{"text":"Cutest cafe in the upstairs food court at First Markham Place. Everything in here is absolutely Pinterest-worthy, from the food displays to the decor to the cup designs. It comes at a price, but once in a while, everyone deserves a fancy cup of Joe.   They have a lot of pastries, but the pistachio loaf is really good! I love it as a afternoon break from work and a special treat to myself."}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend around Union Station and found this cafe with a good rating on yelp. So I decided to hang out with my friend there and walk through PATH. It is a little bit complicated and confused to walk in PATH, always seems like a mystery to me. Thanks to the PATH map I grabbed from union station, I finally made a right way to First Canadian Place, and went two levels up, found Maman in the corner of food court.  My friend and I both was wowed by the cute bicycle outside the store and the beautiful door.  I'm really a big fan of the decor of Maman: natural, freestyle, delicate, and warm.  The guest will place an order first, and make a payment and pick up the food and beverage in the other end of the store. Thanks to the location, this cafe is still busy during the afternoon time.   The latte is quite good here. Dark roast coffee beans with a strong pleasant aroma and smooth taste. The barista made the milk foam very good and delicate. The latte art is perfect! I also ordered a eclair, coffee flavour, going well with the latte."}
{"text":"Espresso drink is great; their Peach blueberry almond tart is the perfect marriage of crunchy (almond crust) and softness (peach); it is also just the right amount of sweetness making it the perfect afternoon snack!"}
{"text":"Great pistachio croissant and smooth tasting lattes.  Super pretty decorations.  Samples of the pound cake were available.  They are prettier than they taste.  Ah well.  Pretty counts."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Maman. I've walked by this spot numerous times during my lunchtime food court visits, but have always been overwhelmed by the long line. This time I made an effort to arrive at 11am to avoid the lunch rush.   When I stepped into Maman, I was transported into a small Parisian cafe. The decor, lighting and even the cup design are beautiful. Equally as beautiful is the coffee that they serve. I ordered a cortado and was served my coffee in the perfect baby-sized cup. As a cortado should be.   The pastries are presented so beautifully that I couldn't walk by without ordering something. I opted for the white chocolate blueberry lavender loaf. The texture and flavour of the cake was delicious. I was very happy with my choice.   This place does coffee right. I'll be back to try their lunch offerings!"}
{"text":"I work nearby so have been here a few times for lunch/coffee.  Pros: - Food is delicious!   - Odette quiche (butternut squash & kale) is to die for - Pistachio loaf is decadent - Overall decor is super quaint & outdoor patio is amazing  Cons - Pricey - Lunch can run you $14 if you get a combo,  A loaf is $4 (I only come here when I'm looking for a treat!  Can't afford to come here every day!) - They charge you $1 for tap water (for the plastic cup) if you take out;  Used to be free but I guess they got tired of giving out plastic cups - Service is \"indifferent\" - neither friendly nor rude...but definitely not welcoming"}
{"text":"usually have their famous chocolate chip cookie. this cookie. with it's nutty, soft, chocolately goodness is one of the best cookies i've ever had.  SERVICE here is quite awful. unattentive, indifferent staff. they do not pay attention to incoming customers, and usually have their backs to the front, while doing their prep. service is long and slow, and not a place to go to when in a rush. the food and treats are great. the staff there from the cash/barista/to the smug owners/management, keep me from returning. they need to focus a lot more on their customer service."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance every time I come. It's almost like a getaway from the busy city life. I love how they serve Sloane tea.   Hot chocolate is great. Cheers you up on a gloomy rainy day, not many cafe have that effect.  Usually, I don't eat salad, but the ginger dressing here is tasty.   The home baked chocolate cookie is good. Always coming back and bringing friends and new co-workers over.  Love the bike decor and the rustic look!"}
{"text":"I had Americano - it was tasting just like brewed coffee, just like cheap watery coffee. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Finally found another good lunch option in the financial district. My coworker recommended this adorable place and came here on a Friday afternoon. The line was super long even though we came here at around 12:45pm.  I ordered their Cheryl salad and it's pretty good. Fresh and light! I ordered the small size but it's definitely more than enough for me.   While I was lining up to pay, I saw their blueberry lavender bread and I couldn't resist the presentation of it and ordered myself an afternoon treat. I ended up eating it on my way back to the office. You can definitely taste a hint of lavender but not so much of the blueberry.   I will definitely come back and try their lavender drink! (their cups are super cute!)"}
{"text":"went to the shortest line during lunch hour.  it was thias place.  got yhe wine chicken wt rice and a fruit salad.  the chicken though had lots of gravy was tasteless.  not overly impressed bur it was ok"}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, I came here for Saturday Brunch. I love the décor of this place, it's so cute and gorgeous but the brunch was just average.   The food came very quickly, much quicker than the server taking our orders. We ordered the Croque mamn and the smoked salmon served on blines bread. Loved the plates but the food was just meh. It didn't taste fresh imo.  I would go back for the cookie, but probably not for brunch."}
{"text":"Ahhhhhmazing food and drinks ! What a beautiful place indeed ! The ambience and decor is pretty!! The almond croissant that I had was delicious! Highly recommend it !"}
{"text":"I had a quick stop here with a friend for what she said are best chocolate chip cookies in the city and thy were very good. I also had a delicious cappuccino. The slice of pistachio cake we packed was okay, but nothing great. I loved the decor, but they charge you 50 cents if you ask them for a glass of tapwater because it is served in a plastic cup. Just use glasses instead of plastic cups!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the prettiest cafés that I've been to in Toronto. Their coffee cups have more than one design. The prints on the cups, the wallpaper and the tiles are gorgeous. The food is beautifully prepared. Prices are reasonable given the quality of the food and drinks. Lots of photo ops! Maman is definitely a must go for café lovers."}
{"text":"Love love love the ambience here I really feel like I'm in a France cafe with the Easter- like decor of clay rabbits, the florals,  and the rustic wooden tables.  I went here during their happy hour which is from 5 to 7pm. They have such a unique cocktail menu,  like Parcae, and my favorite from there was the Herbes de Provence ($14) -  calvados, lillet infused with herbs, lemon juice,  sugar and egg whites. For the pastries I recommend trying the eclairs ($4.50) - citrus light pineapple filling, and the canele - lemon filling. They have a new menu option that i really enjoyed with crostini tapas customized with toppings of my choice.  I liked the anchovies with sundried tomato spread the most!"}
{"text":"I have been anxiously awaiting this opening and they did not disappoint! I don't think the decor could get any better, it is beautiful, and inviting. French music playing and French staff really make you feel like you're no longer in the financial district. Perfect timing as the outdoor terrace is also now open.  Today it was pay what you wish as 100% of proceeds went to a local charity. The breads and pastries are made in house, hence the delectable smell when you walk in.  I got a skim milk latte and croissant. I didn't know croissants could be so perfect. It was buttery but crispy and light! The latte is also perfect, it is balanced and rich, not weak.  I do believe I have found my new favourite coffee and bakery spot. Cannot wait to try their rotational lunch menu. Je suis amoureuse!"}
{"text":"Honestly, wow. I love this place - the decor, food, coffee, friendly staff all come together beautifully. What an oasis in the financial district.  Absolutely try their baked goods.   Maman serves up daily fruit tarts (usually later in the afternoon) beautifully made with flavours melding together perfectly. They're also not too sweet, have lots of fresh fruit and the presentation's on-point (peach blueberry almond tart, apple tart)! Usually the pound cakes are served up as samples. I prefer the orange cake and matcha ones - they're moist and flavourful. Oh, and Maman's chocochip cookie is anything but average: chunky, nutty (macadamias, almonds, and walnuts), with the right amount of chocolate chips - a worthy splurge (~$3.50) to satisfy that mid-afternoon sweet tooth ;)   On the subject of savoury food: if you're deciding which quiche to try, get the Ham and Cheese. Flavourful fluffiness abounds! You can make it a combo with one of Maman's salad (~$11.50).   Finally, bevvies: Lavender hot choco is delightful. Drip coffee is pretty dece! And their lattes are smooth though, I prefer Mos Mos. However, their coffee station is the cutest - well stocked utensil drawer and lovely containers for your choice between cream/milk/soymilk!"}
{"text":"Maman is a modern/country french cafe located upstairs at 1 First Canadian Place. I didn't expect it to be in a food court but they made the cafe inside a box that looked like a huge crate container. Odd.. but the latte and cappuccino was super smooth and delicious, would highly recommend it! Also, I tried the pound cakes but the pistachio was too heavy and the poppy seed was a bit dry.   Aside from the pros (delicious drinks), the cons I experienced was that the music was loud for a small cafe. There is a constant line of businessmen and women which makes it hard to enjoy a cup of coffee while sitting on the long beautiful wooden tables + cushioned chairs. I wanted to work on my laptop but sadly had to leave as I could not find the wifi (and I called beforehand and the employee told me there was wifi). I would visit again if I am around the area but would not go there for a relaxing cup of coffee or for work. It was a bit of an unpleasant experience for me after such a long anticipation."}
{"text":"The South of France comes to Toronto. Located in the First Canadian Place, Maman is an adorable French inspired cafe. They also have the cutest to-go cups. The service here is pretty quick because the of lunch rush they get during the work week. The small space is also forgiving because of the huge outdoor patio they have in the first Canadian place building- which is a treat to find in our downtown core."}
{"text":"There is no way you will not make a single comment about their cute decor or cups and plates during your first visit. As you can tell from pictures, this place is just so adorable. When we got there (Thursday 1:30pm), most food was sold out. My friend and I shared a piece of vegetable lasagna ($8 or $8.5 can't remember). It was a big piece which was enough for two of us to share plus one drink each. Lasagna was good, nothing amazing about it though. Lavender hot chocolate.... great concept but sorry I did not taste lavender at all. Matcha latte on the other hand was hands down the best I had in the GTA. They did not skimp on matcha powder. It was green, very bitter with strong matcha flavour. It was smooth with a hint of sweetness. I highly recommend it (ONLY if you truly enjoy that bitterness from match. I hope it was not a mistake of dumping too much matcha powder in it hahaha).   Overall, if you do want to check this place out, go early before noon. Worth dropping by to check out the decor and enjoy drink in those cute cups. Will I be back? Maybe... if I can come earlier AND if I can have the same matcha latte I had this time."}
{"text":"I love this beautiful little Parisian cafe.   If you are looking for a great place to sit, read, and have a slice of tart with a good cup of cafe.....this is the place for you.    If you enjoy clay rabbits with flowers in their ears...this place is for you.     They have great saturday brunches too, but call ahead and reserve a spot (they use real cutlery).   Just super pretty, and the owners are very nice.   Their Quiches are really good....just um, don't try to figure out how much butter is in it.   :-D      Their cups are SO pretty I don't want to throw them out...I just want to keep them.    I don't love their almond loaves....I find it kind of gritty and oily.  Everything else is yummy and quite nice.   They use Sloan teas for their lattes.  Great place for lunch....or a great girls spot for brunch."}
{"text":"I was really excited to check this place but ended up being a bit let down. It is hard to find it  if you don't navigate the PATH on the regular, gets really packed all throughout the day and is quite pricey for what you get. I got the matcha latte (pretty good actually) and my friend got a sandwich (which she said was decent, but not worth the $$)   The place is definitely cute and the interior design is perfect instagram material, but it's also quite loud and cramped which takes down the value of the atmosphere a lot. I feel like if you work in the PATH it's a worthy visit, but it's not a destination visit worthy type of place."}
{"text":"This place is quaint and serves a decent selection of pastries, coffee and tea.   The only con is their lunch selection could be so much better. Limited selection and for the price, I could get a better lunch at IQ or Kupfert and Kim.  Most likely won't be back as there are better lunch and coffee options in the PATH."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times since it opened. At first I was extremely mesmerized by the decor - Maman is beautifully decorated with long wooden tables, flowers and vintage furniture. I fell in love with it.   However since visiting a few more times, I have become quite disappointed with the food/drink quality. The coffee is not the best, a little too watery for me. I've tried the proscuitto sandwich at lunch which was the most disappointing of all - the bread tasted cheap, and there were barely any ingredients inside. In the sea of mediocre food court options, this sandwich managed to be fly under my expectations.   In terms of baked goods, the lavender cake is average - it's unique and flavourful, but it tasted too heavy/oily so I was not able to finish it. The best pastry on the menu is definitely the nutty chocolate chip cookie. The cookie is warmed up, soft on the inside with tasty chocolate chips!   Hopefully their other lunch menus are better because Maman is too cute to have disappointing menu options."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I was disappointed with my first visit to Maman. The Instagram pictures initially drew me to this spot but the lack of any decent customer service will keep me from going back.  I had the croissant with smoked salmon... Tasty but an extremely small portion size. I had a ginger/chamomile tea and split a slice pistachio loaf. I really enjoyed the loaf. I got a side of lavender blueberry and white chocolate loaf to go.  Seeing as I've read other reviews about the rude customer service... Hopefully something can be done."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem although it is becoming more and more popular.   The decor is very Parisienne with earthy decor and wild flowers and mason jars (5 stars). Honestly everything in this place is pretty from the food, to the cups, to even the garbage basket on the patio!   The baked goods are a hit or miss. They look incredible though and the loaves are all very dense.  - lemon poppy loaf is 3 stars and lives up to its name - pistachio loaf tastes more like an almond loaf (2 stars),  - lavender blueberry loaf is a great combo (4 stars).  - the cookies are a little too brittle in my opinion, nothing special even though they look like they are (3 stars) - raisin almond twirl thing was awesome (5 stars) - salads are good too but I have only had one. They do serve lunch though as well as alcoholic drinks. - Coffee is good here too.   Only issue with this place is that it is pricey. A latte and loaf can put you back almost $10."}
{"text":"A cute boutique café  tucked in the corner of FCP.  Came here to try out their lattes and cappuccinos. It was creamy and delicious.  + stars for the decor which reminds me of Parisian cafés. (Especially the bunny decors :D!!)  They have a salad bar available which I plan on trying later on - also try the Lavender Hot Chocolate, which I've heard good reviews for."}
{"text":"Would be a good spot to grab a quick snack or coffee. We went for a proper lunch and there are definitely better options in the city for a French meal."}
{"text":"The Path is known to be very busy, and has crowds of business folk, it was nice to visit Maman and step into a whole other world. I felt as if I was transported to some small European cafe. Wooden floors, White Ceilings with cute pictures, and old wooden tables.   The place is so cute! I would definitely come here to catch up on some reading or meet friends. I didn't try the coffee but tried the Pistachio Cake and Blueberry Apple Pie. The Pie had a great crust and I enjoyed the combo of both fruits. The Cake was a bit on the dry side but the taste was pretty good.   Keep Eating,   Angela"}
{"text":"Went for an afternoon tea and obviously when I saw the pistachio cake could resist on it! Don't regret on cutting the healthy eating on this cake... really fresh and you could ACTUALLY tell that it was real pistachio (not like other cakes where you can tell it's fake pistachio flavouring). The ginger tea was also good!! The place is really cute. I really sad by the fact they are closed on weekends like all other restaurants in the path!"}
{"text":"I got the Nicole salad, mustard and roasted pepper quiche, and split a blueberry tartlette. Everything we ordered was very tasty and made with fresh ingredients. The staff were also quite knowledgeable and friendly in explaining the different items on the menu. Although the cafe packs up with people during lunch rush hour, there is additional seating in the area just outside (food court). A great place for lunch in the financial district!"}
{"text":"Went to Maman today to grab some pastries before noon, this place is a hidden gem in the third floor of First Canadian Place. The decor is beautiful, warm and inviting. Like other Yelpers have commented, it really does remind you of a charming cafe in Paris. I order the macaroons and pistachio loaf. The pistachio loaf was moist and rich; it was covered with chocolate and overall very decadent.  I didn't find it too sweet because it was a subtle flavour of pistachio. They also had a lavender loaf and marble loaf. Their macaroons were also airy inside with a nice outside crust. The thyme and lemon flavour really worked well together. I will still need to go back to try their coffee and lunch options. Everything looked amazing and was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Had a great first experience and horrible recent experience. For transparency, this was an experience for take out. I had asked for several almond croissants and was given chocolate croissants instead which I obviously didn't realize until I got home. When I called to ask if I can exchange, the guy I spoke to non chalantly said - only if it was untouched. Eventhough it's not my fault, all I got was \"sorry there's nothing we can do\". For a couple of croissants?   Owner, please revise your policy because you'll be losing much more when you lose a customer who is a huge fan. That's basic business."}
{"text":"Tried the Lavender Hot chocolate. It was okay. No overwhelming Lavender taste. The ambience is cute. And oh.......they do not do brunch anymore.  June 30, 2017 I had the Cappucino and the Blueberry bread. Both are expensive but the Blueberry loaf was really flavourful.  I tasted the Pistachio as well. I prefer the Blueberry."}
{"text":"Nice place, very polite and friendly staff. Iced Matcha, was not great. Rather they did iced matcha tea and not a matcha milk/ almond milk. Chocolate chip cookie looks delish but not memorable. Rather have them at Le Gourmand or Portland Variety of Nutella Cookie at Cake Shoppe. Pistachio cake was better than the cookie."}
{"text":"I really, really tried to like this place. I really did. I fell in love with the interior, the charming setup, and attention to detail. It's, literally, a restaurant out of a Parisian-themed Pinterest account.   But sadly, after a couple of visits, I just can't bring myself to love the actual food (the few things I've tried, anyway). I've visited twice, both in the mornings, around 8:00 AM, and there wasn't too much of a lineup. On those two occasions, I ordered: a) the lavender hot chocolate and b) the lavender blueberry loaf (Visit 1), and c) a regular brewed coffee, and d) a croissant (Visit 2).  After looking forward to trying out the lavender loaf and hot chocolate in particular, they were a bit of a letdown. The loaf is very dense, and lacks in flavour. I could barely taste the lavender (no hint at all!), let alone the blueberry. It was, unfortunately, just a basic loaf. The hot chocolate tasted like any other hot chocolate drink - no hint of lavender in there either. The croissant was fine but a tad bit oily, and the coffee was decent, but nothing to rave over.  Since I love the interior and space so much, and since I work right by First Canadian Place, I'm wiling to give them another try one day (maybe a cookie this time). But for now, 3 stars (2 for the food, 3 for the interior).  For a coffee and croissant, I paid $5.59 with taxes (Visit 1). For a lavender blueberry loaf and lavender hot chocolate, I paid $8.76 with taxes (Visit 2)."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior. Good Americano. Delicious desserts (ordered the lavender loaf, apple pie, and yogurt parfait). A hidden gem in a typical modern food court."}
{"text":"I really wanted to come to this place for brunch and so I did today! It's a tiny and cute little shop at the end of the food court area on the upper level.   I wasn't fond of their ordering system since there weren't any signs indicating where the cashier was or where you are to order your goodies. I guess it was just my issue since most were regulars so they knew where to go... Anyways I ordered a matcha latte and their Croque Maman for a total of just under $15. This was steep for a sandwich and latte!   I was given the Croque Maman right away in a takeout try even though I was going to be eating it there. When I had my first bite, it was very cheesy but I found that it wasn't hot. It was comparable to microwave food since my bread reminded me of a near stale texture. The overall flavours were so so but extremely salty. For the price you would expect more but to me this sandwich was overpriced. I guess the other patrons didn't find it as expensive since they were either bankers or investors as 90% were all in suits! I wouldn't order it again.  The matcha latte was ready a few minutes later. I picked it up and with lattes you expect some cute design but there aren't any. I guess I had high expectations since I noticed another latte with a leaf design so it's only natural to assume yours would have one as well but NOPE! I didn't enjoy my latte either as it was just a tad bit strong in the matcha flavour that it left you with a really bitter aftertaste after each sip! There wasn't a right balance of matcha to latte taste. Since it was expensive, I tried to finish it but I couldn't. I ended up throwing it out since the bitterness was stronger near the end.   Overall, this place wasn't what I expected it to be. I really liked this place based on the social media pictures but I guess that's all they ever will be... Not worth your money! You can get better food elsewhere and for cheaper!"}
{"text":"My first time getting my morning coffee at Maman...they charge extra $0.50 for lactose free milk!!! Is like I am being punished for being lactose intolerant. The lactose free milk is not that much more expensive. Charging each client an extra $0.50 for lactose free milk is a little steep. When buying lactose free milk in the store I pay extra $ 0.50 for 2L of milk. The coffee was okay for the price they charge....nothing special about it."}
{"text":"This place is such a pleasant surprise to find. Walking around the 1 Canada building's food court and finding this quaint, authentic French bistro was such a treat. I got a piece of the pepper and goat cheese quiche, a piece of lavender marble cake, and an iced matcha latte, all of which were delicious and really filling. The decor is so dang cute too, I'll definitely be back on my next visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"They do grabb orders. Love their pistachio cake. Lunches are great too but since it's in financial district gets busy during lunch"}
{"text":"i work very close to maman and some of my coworkers talked about how pretty this place is, so i looked it up on yelp and it had decent reviews so i decided to check it out.  as they said, the place is gorgeous! both the inside and their patio! really enjoyed sitting on the patio with the green view (rare in the financial district) and great music.  however, the food didn't live up to its beautiful ambiance. their unsweetened iced tea was good, but nothing great. their pistachio loaf was not too bad, i liked the pistachio bits in it but i wouldn't get it again as it was way too greasy, sweet, and heavy for my taste. i couldn't finish it cuz it was just too heavy... and it was 3:30 pm and I hadn't had anything all day before that! i was super hungry and could have eaten so much more! the croissant was too oily as well.  i felt pretty gross after. to be honest, i was a little bit disappointed; seemed like they focused so hard on the presentation that they neglected the most important part - the food. i dunno, maybe i just got the wrong stuff. regardless, if it wasn't for the decor, i would have given it 2 stars."}
{"text":"This Parisian style bakery/cafe place is super cute. It reminds me of a little cafe you can find in the southern region of France. This is the second location of the Maman chain. The first cafe is in the SoHo neighbourhood in Manhattan. The cafe has a rustic feel to it and it also feels very cozy. Like other Yelpers say, this cafe is actually difficult to find. It's in the upstairs food court in First Canadian Place near the IQ restaurant. Be sure to come earlier during lunch to avoid the lunch rush. The line up gets hectic around here since it is located in the financial district.   Went during lunch and my party only ordered the \"two salads for $11\" option. Okay hands down, their salads are pretty good especially the one that has cranberries (I believe the salad was called Julie). Though the salads are pricey, I think it is worth trying it at least once in your life time. Also, their menus change frequently so be sure to check their website to see what they are serving on that specific day. I also ordered their ice tea ($3). Their ice tea is what drove down this rating to a 4. The ice tea was not good... highly do not recommend. I haven't tried their other baked goods or coffee/lattes but I'm sure they would be decent and better than the ice tea. Their packaging is also super cute and trendy."}
{"text":"I don't come here as often anymore as the service is standoffish most days and the initial hype has worn off.  There is still a soft spot in my heart for those gooey, fresh baked Maman cookies which are always consistently delicious.  The lavender hot chocolate was disappointing and not as fragrant as it sounds.  The loaf cakes, especially the pistachio loaf is very heavy and greasy. It wasn't a moist, buttery texture but a dense, greasy slab with an oily after-taste.  Many other places nearby that do better salads."}
{"text":"FYI if you're only there for a coffee, they kick you out (even if the place isn't full) at 5pm, unless you buy more food or alcohol."}
{"text":"Decent food and lovely country-feel oasis in busy financial district area. My fave from here is the egg dill and avocado sandwich."}
{"text":"Visiting Maman is kind of magical, especially as it's located just off a food court, yet it feels like being in a rustic French kitchen. The combined fragrance of butter and coffee provides a heady rush as you make your menu selection and wait (not long at all) for your order to arrive. Prices are a bit higher than the nearby food court alternatives.  The menu is somewhat limited for lunch (quiche choices are not bad) but the dessert and coffee options are a must try. Lavender hot chocolate, anyone?"}
{"text":"Finally, found time to try Maman. It is on the second floor of First Canadian place. Their queue of people rivals the Asian fan club of Uncle Tetsu. Maman prides itself on being French and serving French food. Part of the deal is a feigned French rustic provincial look. They serve coffee, cookies, pastry, soup, salad and sandwiches. Croque \"maman\" Parisian ham sandwich was tasty, but you would have to eat it fast before it gets cold. It has a French toast feeling to it because of its egginess. The Kale quiche is appreciated because it feels light and, again, because it is different. Indeed I would not recommend Maman so much because the food and drinks are great, but because they are different. That alone makes me appreciate them (and I suspect it is the same for others too) because who needs another Tim Hortons or McDonalds? The prices are not too high given the popularity and their location in The Path. All menu items are listed on the glass in front of the displays and menus are on the side as you enter. The staff is friendly and very polite, which is good. They hypocritically ask you whether you are staying or taking the food out however. Finding a seat in there would be like finding humanity in Donald Trump.  What is the story behind the name?"}
{"text":"*This review only reflects the brunch service.  *For their brunch, I really appreciated how Maman don't have the typical egg benedict that you would see on every brunch's menu in Toronto. *You can make a reservation for their weekend brunch through email.  *The staff are true Parisian, no Quebecois french (for those who cares....)  *The service was amazing and tentative.  *Quite and relaxing ambiance.   -Matcha Latte - $5:  The drink quality here are always consistent! Instead of normal milk, Maman servers the matcha latte with almond milk. I liked how the latte wasn't too sweet and you can taste the strong (almost grassy) taste of matcha, which is how I like it :).  -Smoke Salmon served on blinies bread with yogurt sauce, lemon, dill & espelette pepper - $15:  Friend loved it and licked the plate clean.   -Croque \"maman\" with parisian ham, comté cheese and béchamel sauce (optional with a sunny side-up egg +$2) - $15:  The croque madame, or \"maman\" came out piping hot and it was a huge portion! Without the egg, the sandwich would still have been really filling and it was worth the $13 price tag. The side salad had a bit too much dressings, but it was refreshing after having a heavy sandwich.  Oh boy, I normally dislike the béchamel sauce as some tends to taste a bit too flour-y or bland, but this was incredibly flavorful and the sauce was not too thin nor thick. The cheese just slightly melted, creamy and buttery. Break the egg yolk and it will runs through your sandwich and mixes with the cheese and béchamel sauce, and it turns into this eating experience that is just beyond words.   -Matcha green tea pancakes with blueberries, ricotta & shredded coconut - $14:  The matcha flavor didn't come through and it was almost undetectable.I couldn't taste the ricotta nor shredded coconut either. The texture of the pancake was too doughy, dense and almost rubbery. I thought the portion was quite small for $14, but it was a good sized portion without making you feeling stuffed. The one positive thing I can think of was that the pancake was not too sweet, even with the syrup and whipped cream."}
{"text":"Cute cafe in FCP. The food (salads, sandwiches, quiches) are delicious. Desserts are even better. A bit on the pricier side."}
{"text":"They serve toby's estate, which allows me to get a little piece of new york, since I've moved back to Toronto. Some of the staff are actually french, which is great.   The food here is decent. The salads are pretty good and the $6 size is decently feeling. The egg salad sandwich is pretty good, but has red onions, for those who have afternoon meetings... The croque is pretty tasty but very heavy, also for those who have afternoon meetings.."}
{"text":"Was very very disappointed in this place. The barista was super friendly but the person taking orders was quite stand-offish and rude. Don't be fooled by the cute decor like I was. The treats are alright, they look a lot better than they taste. I would say overall they are very overpriced and abbot snobbish. Not my cup of tea"}
{"text":"It's a quaint little spot for sure - very \"shi shi\" if you're looking for a quick grab spot in the financial district. I found it overpriced - and the sandwich I chose (a club sandwich minus bacon plus some sort of mayo? Avocado mayo?) ended up with me going through a bout of food poisoning. Not a great way to end my first (and last) trip to Maman.  Three stars for its esthetically-pleasing decor and setup and pastry selections. The lemon poppyseed loaf was dry. I can't believe I'm saying this - but for great lemon loaf, go to Starbucks."}
{"text":"The food (pastries) and coffee are very good. But there's something up with the pricing. If you order coffee and croissants, to go, on a weekend morning, you apparently get charged extra (that is, substantially more than the prices posted) because... it's brunch? That was the explanation. Which didn't make sense, because these items were supposed to be to go. (That is, no table service, no sitting in the café.) An otherwise nice place I won't be going back to for this reason."}
{"text":"I think the interior decoration of this cafe is really cute but the amount of seats is way lesser than it is in pictures. I ordered a latte and it was average. Their ordering system is very confusing. I came here on a Tuesday around 12/1pm and it was the worst idea ever. The line was extremely long because it was lunch hour. The service wasn't great. When I told the girl I only want a coffee, she seemed really annoyed about it and redirect me to the cashier. Didn't say thank you or make eye contact with me. It's like I was bothering her from taking lunch orders. I hope they improve their customer service soon because it's ruining how cute the cafe actually is smmhhhhh....."}
{"text":"Maman is a nice sit down place to catch up with friends, meet with coworkers or have a moment to yourself. The European/Parisienne vibe makes it a great coffee shop to get away from the tiring \"financial district\" atmosphere. Apart from the decor, I found the coffee and food to be mediocre with quite a high price tag. This is one of those places where you come to admire the decor than for the food."}
{"text":"Delicious lattes and oh my wow, the croissants - one of the best I've had in the city! Decor was cute, very south of France-y and communal tables had ample space and outlets, if need be.  For lunch, I had the cold cut ham and cheese on a baguette and it was great. Next time, I have to try the salads! Can't wait to revisit :)"}
{"text":"Came here today for the first time with some friends for coffee and tea.  The decor was really pretty and has 2 large communal tables that is perfect to meet up with friends.  I heard the chocolate croissants here are amazing but I was too full from lunch.  I had the Sloane Ginger Twist tea which was really good.  I was really not impressed with the service.  I asked the cashier which tea flavour was most popular and she wasn't really interested in responding and then muttered it's all good...  That was definitely not helpful."}
{"text":"I have searched for love and I have now found love. I have tasted its intoxicating, delicious fruit. I am walking on clouds from its weightlessness, And like any budding relationship, I must protect us. I must protect it from glomming over it. From nauseating insecurity and selfishness. I must give it room to breathe and grow and evolve.  I ate the lavender, blueberry loaf and it is moist, heavenly and absolutely delicious. It is not a heavy slice of cake. The lavender icing is a touch of heaven! I felt so relaxed as I enjoyed each morsel. Letting the blueberries explode in my mouth. Letting the lavender caress my lips.  At a little under $4, this is a treat to be enjoyed sporadically. That and the fact I want to keep my waistline."}
{"text":"Adorable coffee shop from New York City and now with a location in Toronto! I was so excited to visit this coffee shop - love the decor and would recommend getting their white chocolate matcha drink."}
{"text":"This place is lovely. Very cute decor with minimalist bunny rabbit accents - adorable!   I love to come here for coffee dates. It's a bit more private than the rest of the First Canadian Place food court. There's very long harvest table seating, and if you come during off hours (maybe 10AM-11:30AM, and any time after 2PM?) - there tends to be free spots.  The desserts are wonderful! I love the moist pistachio loaf, as well as the lavender blueberry loaf. They also have amazing cookies."}
{"text":"Oh wow. We came here at 10am on a weekday for coffee. The place is very busy (had to wait in line even at 10am) so I can imagine it´s a little nuts over lunch or early am.  The decor is just absolutely beautiful, as is their outdoor patio. Really felt like I was in some kind of Victorian Parisian home untouched by time as some of the decor is vintage and beautifully preserved.  My americano was delicious and I tried a bite of a strawberry cream pie. It had clearly been made several hours before as the strawberries were perfectly fresh.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"The shop and patio are both super cute. The service is good and there are non dairy options as well. However, the coffee is mediocre. I recommend the pastries though - delicious! I had the almond croissant and pain au chocolat."}
{"text":"First off, amazing decor. Parisian style, and the employees that were working when I visited had a bit of a French accent too. How this place works is you order and receive your items at the counter- if you'd like to sit down, they have designated tables within their enclosed area (roughly seats 20 people), so you don't need to fight for tables in the FCP food court.   I ordered the quiche and salad combo, which came out to approx $12.50. Both were amazing- the salad is similar to what you can get from somewhere like iQ next door, but just without any protein. Dressing also served on the side (unlike Pumpernickel's pre-dressed salads). All in all, a great deal for lunch items."}
{"text":"When Maman first opened, I was super excited and enamoured with this place. Like other reviewers have mentioned, it is so so cute inside, and a refreshing change from all the other standard, humdrum fast-food places littering the PATH. I have been here three times in total - once for lunch and twice in the early/late afternoon, just to satisfy my sweet tooth cravings. Perhaps it is due to poor timing on my part, but by lunchtime/the afternoon, the selection of pastries is largely depleted, so the only things I have had a chance to try are the \"famous\" nutty chocolate chunk cookie, the pistachio loaf, and small samples of the lavender loaf. I have also had lunch here once, and got a quiche. Food-wise, unfortunately nothing really blew me away, and the one thing that was fairly consistent was that every item I got felt really dense and heavy and also really oily... particularly the cookie, to the point where after eating I just felt kind of gross. I am intrigued enough to want to come back and try some of their other pastries (i.e. almond croissant), but I don't think I would particularly feel the urge to choose this place again as a lunch option."}
{"text":"Adorable Parisian bakery! The decor is beautiful. Maman is vintage, quaint, and picture perfect.   My colleague and I shared the plain croissant ($2.75) and pistachio cake ($3.50). Not the best croissant I have ever eaten - flaky but very oily. The oil soaked through the bag. The pistachio cake was slightly too sweet for our tastes. The batter mix seemed uneven. The cake lacked balance.   I really wanted to love Maman. It seems to lack substances based on our order. Perhaps I will come back to try other menu items if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious pastries, especially liked the canelé. Good strong coffee in pleasant surroundings."}
{"text":"Cute little place within the financial district. I wish it was a stand alone store because it feels a little weird that it's a part of a food court in the PATH. One step into the place transforms you into Paris. It's a really cute place for a quick bite as there arent too many tables around. They have a nice selection of tea and pastries. Prices are average for French style bakeries/cafes downtown."}
{"text":"I recently went to the launch event for new cocktail menu at Maman. The cocktail, which I tried was 'Le Vert' and it was great! It was exactly how I like my cocktails - not sweet!  Apart from the drink, the highlight, for me, were their sweet treats! I happen to be a huge fan of lemon meringue pie and one of their sweets was a lemon meringue bite size treat. I could have eaten the entire tray!  The food is amazing, the décor is lovely...all in all, I will be going back to this French inspired cafe! A great addition to the financial district...and a great escape from the concrete jungle to the French country!"}
{"text":"Well there must be so much to try but I arrived around 2 pm on a week day during the holidays so there was not too much to choose from.  Alas, I have to come again to test out their croissant! They didn't have any at the time.  The ham and cheese quiche tasted yum however the crust was tough flaky and dry. Not sure if it was also due to the later time that I arrived there. The pistachio loaf cake was not dry and tasted good but had a dense grainy texture. I was not wowed. The canelle ? Was Oh So Yummy! Chewy and not too sweet and just sweet enough. Would definitely get more of these!  The lavender hot chocolate was, as reviews have said, quite delicious, thick - if you like your hot chocolate chocolaty, not overpowering with the lavender at all.   So among my bites 2 out of 4...were yummy.  The decor was beautiful !! From the decorative floor to the rustic wood tables and window frames and random chairs.  I have not been to France but it feels quite french :)   The real test is the croissant ... Hopefully I'll be lucky to come across an almond croissant there ..."}
{"text":"Everything use to be so fresh and delicious.. now I go in at 11am and the baked goods shelf is almost barren.. I buy the last 2 canele and they are rock hard and stale.. You would think they would bake a fresh batch daily and have the shelves stocked full when its not even lunchtime yet"}
{"text":"Visiting Maman during my work day for a Jasmine Mist tea is like a little visit to the French country side. I absolutely love how cute it is in there and the atmosphere brightens my day."}
{"text":"Hunt down this place with all the excitement since the ones in New York are so highly rated! It was slightly disappointing when I realized it was tugged in a food court but then still looking forward to getting my patisserie fix. I got here at 10/1030am so it wasn't busy at all, staff aren't exactly helpful nor suggestive. Bakeries were mediocre but the lavender hot chocolate was nice.   This would be a decent lunch spot for nearby offices but nothing in comparison to the standard in New York, and it's more just another sandwich/ coffee shop."}
{"text":"Lovely french cafe for lunch. It's located on the 2nd floor of a building (shopping mall/office). It's a great little spot for a lunch or coffee break. I love their Quiche & Salad combo lunch. Any quiche is delicious, and they have many kind of salad. The portion is huge so I can't finish everything. I honestly wasn't impressed by their pastries, but I'd definitely return for lunch if I have a chance to come back to Toronto. I had 2 lunch and 1 breakfast during my 3 days trip.  Staff are very nice and helpful even when they're super busy. But this opinion can be biased because I'm from NY.."}
{"text":"Very cute pastry shop in First Canadian Place.  My fav of all time are the pistachio loaves, the right amount of icing."}
{"text":"Yuck.   First of all keep pound cake simple. All those weird exoctic flavors that you add to the mix makes for a weird texture and taste.   I ordered a Matcha Latte with Almond Milk. Yuck. It tasted like seaweed I couldn't even finish it. I nearly threw up I thought I was going to stroke out. The nice Security Guard at 1 First Canadian Place asked me if I needed an Ambulance I said no thank you.   Goodness don't know how I will ever get over this traumatic event.   Seriously Lavender Pound Cake? What kind of sick people do this to Pound Cake?"}
