{"text":"This is my favorite place to grab a quick lunch in Oakland. Fast service, with a smile, and I've never ordered something I didn't like. I'm a huge fan of their breadsticks and the calzones are pretty good too."}
{"text":"The pizza is great. The delivery guy is really nice. I like thin crust pizza, so I wish it could be a little bit more thinner. Other than that, everything is perfect"}
{"text":"IT'S FIVE DOLLAR PIZZA!!!  Okay, I'll be the first to admit that Sorrento's is not the best or classiest pizza joint in Pittsburgh. But it's cheap and open late (until around 3 on the weekend). For college students this place is always a good choice....especially after a late night of partying. After around 10 is when the place really gets packed, mostly because of their $5 large pizza deal (starts at 8PM and ends at closing).  The pizza is okay (it's neither outstanding nor disgusting), but I've definitely paid more for much worse in Pittsburgh. It has never been under-cooked and is ready pretty quickly. If you are doing a late night pick-up I would suggest calling in your order to avoid waiting in line surrounded by super drunk college kids (although the conversations you can't help but overhear are pretty funny). I would say splurge and pay the extra $1 for their super yummy BUTTERMILK RANCH (if I could I would probably drink it...andI basically do...) The ranch is ADDICTIVE so I don't mind paying a bit extra. The pizza is hot and super cheesy with a thin crust and okay sauce.  I've had times when I've literally eaten a whole box by myself with two containers of ranch (cuz the guys didn't want to share) and I loved every moment of it.....even though my stomach wasn't too happy. I'd say give it a try! Instead of paying $3 for a slice, grab a box or two with some friends and stop by the 24-hour Rite-Aid for 2 for $3 2-Liter Pepsi."}
{"text":"Chicken Parm doesn't make the grade.  Chicken not quality and barely any sauce.  Bread was okay and I guess the cheese was okay too."}
{"text":"As a customer of 20 years, who started as a kid, Pitt, continued through my 20's and still do now in my early 30's, I can tell you that there are 2 Sorrento's. 1 is the Daytime and the other is at Night. The first is a moderately priced pizza shop, geared towards working professionals that dominate the scene during the day while the students are in class. This Sorrento's makes the best pizza, not just in Oakland but in my opinion, Pgh. The rest of their menu of Pasta's, Hoagies and app's round of the menu very nicely. The second is geared towards college students or more aptly put hammered drunk kids, who want something as affordable as the dollar drafts they just finished consuming at the local college bars. The pizza is still decent, especially for $5, which makes it a 5 star price to quality and if you want to deck it out, you can add extra sauce, cheese and toppings, but YES YOU HAVE TO PAY ADDITIONAL FOR IT, but its still under $10 and more like $7.50 for extra cheese and a topping.  Give it a shot during the day or late night for $5."}
{"text":"I'm a guy who likes his pizza, and I gotta say, I liked this pizza.  Didn't *love*, but liked, and for the price you can't go wrong.  I'll keep looking for the perfect slice, but for the perfect *price* go with Sorrento's.  Also: Consider its location if you're ordering on Friday or Saturday night, it's a campus parlor and those kids are hungry, so expect a long delivery time."}
{"text":"Had the Meatball Calzone. Meatballs had good flavor, plenty of cheese, and the cheese was both Ricotta and provolone.  The crust had a good flavor, but was a bit tough. Chewy. Personal preference is for it to be a bit flakier.   Other than that, it was good.    Had a side salad, Italian dressing. Good quantity of lettuce, two small Roma tomatoes, and good flavor for the dressing."}
{"text":"So this isn't the best pizza in town, however if you're on a budget craving good tasting pizza, then this is the place to go. Their crust is not bad. Plus, they're quick, and they offer discounts for students/staff."}
{"text":"I have ordering pizza and Italian hoagies from here since I was a kid. It is the best! The cheese and sauce is on point! I was diagnosed with celiac in 2013. It's been rough but thank You Sorrento's for making the best gluten free pizza in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Living in the Scranton/Old Forge area I'm very picky about my pizza when traveling but I have to say that Sorrento's is one of the best \"cheap pizzas\" I've encountered in my travels. Despite it's price, the pizza certainly doesn't taste like something you would consider a cheaper pizza and it's definitely something I would eat regularly if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"Sometimes the holes-in-the-wall have something the pretty places don't; in this case, Sorrento's Pizza is that old, dank place that you'd normally pass right by, but if you give it a chance you'll be amazed.  If you're tipsy or simply out late at night, this place is not to be passed by... not even for the competition down the street. Unlike the latter, Sorrento's has indoor seating which comes in handy in the winter, I'm sure!  The pizza is great. I've paid $15+ for a pizza that was far below the taste, quality, and speed of the $5 pie at Sorrento's!  A perfect end to a great, inebriated, or just long night is simple: Sorrento's!"}
{"text":"I was a under cooked pizza and the pizza dough was not done. I ordered my pizza on November 29, 2017. I was to the stomach after eating the pizza. They knew the pizza was under cooked when they gave it to me. The three buddies."}
{"text":"Ignoring the somewhat shabby interior with old wooden booths in a relatively drab setting, this place is awesome.  Can you say $5 large pizza?  Out in Oakland at a late hour?  Why not finish your night with some pizza?  Hungry for lunch?  $5 pizza will do.  Maybe a quick dinner?  $5 pizza is right here.  This is not any cheapo grease-laden, coronary vessel oblietaring POS.  This pizza is high quality, incredibly tasty, and honestly probably the best value in all of Pittsburgh.  And with that being said, 5 stars for $5 pizza."}
{"text":"I usually only get Sorrento's during their late night special, but I decided to order a pizza to my workplace for delivery. This was a big mistake, as I waited over an hour for the pizza! I could've walked over to sorrento's, ordered, eaten, and been back to work in the time it took to get my pizza delivered! Good food but delivery is so slow!!"}
{"text":"The crust was really good, but there was too much cheese / too little sauce. The cheese was undercooked a little as well, not burnt or bubbly, and it separated from the slice. We ordered near closing though, so it might be better earlier in the day."}
{"text":"Fucking horrible delivery never showed up or called.  Not a good impression. On to the next"}
{"text":"Took an hour and a half when they said an hour. Forgot plates and napkins. Pizza was pretty plain."}
{"text":"I don't care what anyone says.  I love Sorrento's pizza.  My dad used to bring me here as a kid when he worked across the street.  As an adult, I figured I would be really disappointed, but it was just as good as I remember the pizza.  Coming in for the first time at dinner time, my friends and I ordered an extra large pizza with pepperoni and extra cheese for $10.  The pizza is super greasy and will literally melt the paper plate away.  It arrives at your table fresh out of the oven and loaded with cheese and toppings.  Everything about this pizza is fantastic.  I pulled down four slices at dinner and three slices during the night.  I love this cheap pizza.  It's not authentic Italian, but it is so good nonetheless.  The employees are super nice and casual, and the police were here eating dinner when we were.  That is always a good sign in my book.  My friends and I have started coming in regularly after our night classes end at 9 PM because we start craving their pizza in the middle of class.  Super cheap and fast!"}
{"text":"The quality pizza here really is a 2/5, the crust under the sauce and cheese is too thin to compensate for the floods of oil provided by the puke-smelling \"cheese.\" I've never had a piece of pizza where I wanted to get to the plain crust at the end because its prelude was so miserable. Sorrento's does not apply a great amount of sauce to their pizza, and the oil only further dilutes the sauce's flavor.  Ordering one of these pizzas and trying to consume it hot is oral suicide: prepare for intensive reparative surgery from the third degree oil burns that will afflict the entirety of your mouth. Often times, the only way to make this pizza bearable is to drop even MORE money on ranch dressing, which is essentially like submitting an early request on the heart disease that this lipid dense pizza is already guaranteeing you.  Despite this negative review, in my Pitt career, I must have consumed dozens upon dozens of Sorrento's pizzas. Why? Am I a idiot? Am I an masochist? Perhaps both, but, here's my analysis...  To graduate from the University of Pittsburgh WITHOUT drunkenly devouring a pizza in Sorrento's at 1:27AM while listening to Becky from Tower A cry about her ex at Penn State dumping her, is not a complete Pitt experience.  Essentially, Sorrento's is a necessary and iconic player in Pitt's South Oakland late night lifestyle. Eating here is mandatory for those wanting a social college experience. I give Sorrento's 3/5  because as terrible as the pizza is, I will continue to eat it and continue to Hail to Pitt."}
{"text":"I can't believe more people haven't reviewed Sorrento's! I love this place!  I lived on Atwood Street over the summer and ate here probably twice a week. $5 large pizzas, but they are actually GOOD. No, this isn't your authentic Italian pizza or New York style pizza, in fact I'm not sure what exactly it is. But I do know that the crust is crispy yet chewy, the sauce is good (not too-sweet or too-heavy), and there's tons and tons of cheese. I had a friend who worked at a couple different pizza shops in town who said that Sorrento's used the freshest ingredients that he had seen, which probably accounts for its deliciousness. Just go on the earlier side of the $5 deal to miss the bulk of the drunk student crowd.  Also their handwritten sign denoting \"Free Wi-Fi\" cracks me up every time (yeah, it doesn't take much)."}
{"text":"This isn't New York pizza, but it gets a 4-star rating for still being delicious and being one of the best, delicious, and cheapest pizza places in Pittsburgh. A large pizza is only $6 on weekend nights after a certain time (I think 8PM). Plus, their ranch sauce is heavenly. I usually came during late 1-2am weekend nights while seeking a meal after a night out. There aren't many options for late night eateries in Oakland, but this was the spot. The line would usually be long, but it moved very quickly. I usually asked for pepperoni on my pizza which would take longer, but it was worth the wait! But the plain cheese was great as well. The pizza is greasy, but I would consider it the perfect amount of grease that I would want on a pizza. My favorite thing about Sorrento's pizza is that the cheese is extremely \"melty\" and oozes as you eat it. I have been here on non-weekend nights as well and got pizza and it had the same great taste. I have never tried any of the other menu items, but it seems like they have great lunch deals!"}
{"text":"Waited 25 minutes for a pineapple and olive pizza. On arrival the pizza was tasteless and low quality.I would only recommend it to people who enjoy the taste of cardboard."}
{"text":"Great pizza and late night weekend specials. Walk in X-Large pizza for $6. $1 toppings is also an excellent price with the deal. If you are in a pizza mood in Oakland, Sorrento's is one of the best available at a wonderful price."}
{"text":"Wow! The meat lovers pizza with banana peppers.   They're really efficient and everything can be done from your bed after a long day. Love that.   They have tons of stuff to choose from, but you heard it first- the breadsticks are perfection. Not too hard, not too doughy. Get them."}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service ever, I would go to Antoons over this garbage place any day. The owner kicked me out even when I was buying a pie from the place. Worst experience of my life!"}
{"text":"Ordered an XL Pepperoni and provolone sticks, form my wife and I for delivery to Magee as we're here with the arrival of our first child.  Price was reasonable and delivery time was reasonable, but I wouldn't call the pizza an XL just a large.  Ordered at 6:10pm on a Saturday and it was delivered at 7:00.  Pizza and sticks were both pretty cold, but such as it is for delivery.  Pizza tasted just ok, not bad and not great.  Provolone was t very good.  Weren't hot at all and just didn't taste good.  Ordered from Sciulli's a few weeks ago when in hospital and it's a very short walk, only 5 min, was ready in 20 min and pizza was excellent and provolone sticks great as well and I was able to get it all back to my wife on foot before it was cooled off.  Price was the same, but pizza was much larger if you're feeding 3-4 it's enough."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here when there was no one in line and we waited for 20 minutes to get a cheese pizza and 2 other people got their orders BEFORE us even though we came here first. Rude af"}
{"text":"A classic late night pizza joint in Oakland. The late night special is $6.50 for a large cheese pizza. All you need is a side of ranch and you are set. The pizza quality is nothing special, but its quick and cheap. My only complaint is that the cheese does easily slide off the pizza. Their ranch is also delicious and definitely elevates the pizza. Don't expect gourmet pizza, but if you want to satisfy that cheesy greasy pizza craving come here!"}
{"text":"They have thick crust pizza! Since I've moved to Pittsburgh, I've been on the hunt for great think crust pizza ... and now I have two places to go (here and Pizza Perfecta in Shadyside)!  I got the Chicago style pizza - which I think was great! I definitely plan on coming back to try their other types of pizza."}
{"text":"Still searching for an adequate pizza shop I found Sorrento's on Bing. They had a coupon for four large pizzas for $20.00.  Even if the pizza was crappy, it's still four pies for twenty dollars.  The coupon also said that they offered toppings for $2.00.  I ordered the special, mentioned the coupon and added pepperoni to two of the pizzas.  The girl said it would be $29.97 (or something close to that) and when I asked why it was four dollars more than it should be she said the price was $24.00 not $20.00.  The coupon is on their website so if they aren't responsible enough to update it then why should I have to pay more than advertised?  The pizza took 66 minutes to arrive which, unless I woke up in an alternative universe where math is done differently, is a lot longer than 45 minutes.  Will I order here again? If they the coupon which will probably still be up I might.  I printed the page with the coupon and gave it to the driver - whether it gets to the manager or not remains to be seen.  It might sound petty to quibble over four dollars but it's the principal of the matter - don't advertise (even on your own website) if you aren't going to back it up."}
