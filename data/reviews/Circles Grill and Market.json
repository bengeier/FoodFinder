{"text":"If not the best Italian, definitely the second best. Great Apps and nice and quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not sure why market is in the name - nothing to buy on the shelves. But service was great and food was solid. I think they need to market to surrounding neighborhoods because it could be a local favorite despite the name that doesn't fit. Mostly Italian with some Spanish dishes thrown in. Plenty of options including kids menu."}
{"text":"I am from NY and was visiting friends and family in NC.    I came across this little gem in a strip mall by the name of circles grill, which is actually a mix of American and Italian food.  To my surprise the food was delicious.  We had a few apps and entrees.  The mussels, zucchini fries, and soup were so fresh and yummy.  The pasta with clam sauce was also really well prepared and delicious.  Really fantastic wine list as well.    A gentleman sitting next to me was raving about the porkchop.  Fantastic little gem with a pretty bar.  I will certainly be back soon."}
{"text":"Awful. I would give it a zero if possible. Two us went for lunch. There was nobody in the restaurant. We ordered 2 paninis. After 25 minutes of nothing (nobody came to the table to explain or apologize) we stood up and told them we were leaving. Nobody really cared. Empty and bad service. Stay away from there."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!  Crispy fries and the patio seating was the icing on the cake for a sunny day!"}
{"text":"Warm, friendly greeting as we entered the restaurant!  Good, appropriate attention from the staff and server.  Food was some of the best we have enjoyed in Charlotte.  Good selection, good presentation and prepared exactly as requested/expected.  The staff kept everything refilled, moving, paid attention to the table yet did not get in the way.  The drinks, the appetizers, the main courses were great....no room for dessert, so we ordered take out!  The mgmt. and staff are serious and want everything to be perfect.  You can actually have a conversation with your spouse/friends while eating.....recommend highly!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner this week.  This was our 4th time dining at Circles and first time for dinner.  Again, everything was excellent.  Calamari was great!  Blackened Salmon special was just delicious. Family was pleased with their entrees also.  This is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Good Italian, odd name, great service. Don't let the confusing title of Grill and Market sway your decision. The food was tasty and authentic. Worth the try and a possible return.  BTW, no grocery shelves...in that I suggest Circles Italian Cafe for the marquee."}
{"text":"Good sports atmosphere but the service has been so slow the past few times. Not sure if it is the then or the servers but the place seems oblivious to the 30-45 minute wait for wings and a kids grilled cheese.  Decent tasting food but seems to be a place to just go for drinks and games.  Shame since I'm in the neighborhood that backs up to it."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. My husband, who is very picky about steaks, was happy with his ribeye. I got the pasta and loved it. Excellent local draft beers. We did take our kids and they had a kids menu but better for date night sans kids."}
{"text":"I ate at Circles yesterday and sat outside to enjoy the glorious sunny day. We again LOVED it.  My friend and I each had a bowl of black bean soup, which was outstanding. (I don't even like black beans but Bill suggested that we try it).  For lunch, we had a Reuban and Cobb salad.  Each were so good!!! This restaurant is a rare find today.  The Peruvian chef is so talented.  Please give Circles a try and you will not be disappointed. The woman beside us had a Vegetarian Panic and she also was raving.  \"Good\" restaurants are difficult to find and this one is top notch!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, not knowing what to expect as they just recently opened.  Wow, nice place. Had the chicken and basil panini with hot, fresh fries, both were delicious. The service was top notch, although they were not very busy my waitress was not hovering over the table. Checked on food when delivered, refilled as needed. Check presentation was timely and professional. Great start, will return for dinner."}
{"text":"Great staff, delicious tasting food, great atmosphere and a full bar. Was very pleased with the service they went above and beyond to make our visit enjoyable."}
{"text":"This was my first time there. Amazing. The wait staff was on spot and Chef Wesley can cook anything to perfection. A true hidden gem in the Fountains shopping center off Audrey Kell Rd."}
{"text":"Was disappointed.  Had the carne Asada with Chimichurri and it was so dry and chewy. The potatoes were really salty and the spinach was stringy and bitter. I felt in general the prices were very high for the offerings.  My friend the Bucatini Bolognese and felt it was a bit under seasoned ....that might indicate some inconstancy by the chef in seasoning.  On a positive note, the service was good and the decor is nice.  Maybe we just picked an off-day to visit."}
{"text":"First, they came for the calamari, but I did not say anything because they were out of calamari. Then they came for the zucchini, and again I remained silent, as they were out of zucchini also. It was 6 pm on Friday.  I write this review ironically as this place will no longer be in business by the time anyone reads this.  Get the chicken parmigiana. Enjoy your one shriveled piece of chicken breast. It's extra good because they don't bother with that pesky mozzarella cheese on top, which is always a bummer. Please, pay $19 for ravioli from the freezer. The mussels? Better get two orders because there are about 6 mussels per order.  The owners were sitting right next to us and were sure to get us our check before offering dessert because we dare to be unimpressed with their garbage. I'd say don't bother coming, but it won't be here if you try."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem of a restaurant.  Every meal has been outstanding. These guys know how to put wonderful flavors together. My wife and I have had several dishes- the pork chop, linguini and clams, blackened salmon, chicken parm, bucatini bolognese, and a pasta special that was offered in the fall were all excellent and flavorful.  The food is creative, original and delicious. Portions and prices are spot on."}
{"text":"Awesome new find!!   Great Italian food with amazing service. It's high end Italian at reasonable prices in a casual, friendly atmosphere.  We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"New restaurant. Great bread. Appropriate service. Best mussels I have ever had. My husband had clams and they were delicious. We plan on going back really soon."}
{"text":"We wondered where to go on a Sat night in South Charlotte, I  looked on YELP and found Circles Grill and Market....Do not let the name fool you ..it is not a Market - It is a cute Italian Restaurant, A small menu but everything we had was good. We were greeted by the manager Bill when we walked in. He took us to our table and told us about the Beer on Tap ( lots of good Locals) and his wine list. We decided to start out with some Bruschetta and it was really good...garlicky and fresh tomatoes on a nice grilled bread. My husband had OMB Copper Beer and I had a glass of Rodney Strong Cabernet. Clam Linguine was my choice for my entree and My Husband Had the Chicken Milanese. No salad was offered or side. My Clam Linguine was very good...fresh little neck clams around the edge of the plate..seasoned just right. My husbands chicken was crispy and had a nice side of spaghetti alio oil  and fresh arugula and tomato on the top of the chicken. We were presented with a Dessert Plate and the end...We chose a Piece of Tiramisus for dessert and it was quite large and delicious!! Enough for the two of us nicely. Its a really good place..but hidden without a lit sign to even tell you where the Fountain Shopping  Center is...All this place needs is some advertising and customers...we need a nice little place like this...Try it out..you will not be disappointed at all!"}
{"text":"Great ambience.  The events are fun with talented entertainment!  Amazing, fresh food from an eclectic chef. Check this up and coming restaurant out!"}
{"text":"Overall the food is really good. We had bruschetta and it seemed to have just a tad bit too much olive oil on it. Had it had anymore on it we would not have eaten it. My husband had chicken Parmesan and I ordered a salad with grilled salmon. He said his tasted good and my salon was cooked perfect. I also enjoyed whatever the dressing was, I just wish it would have been on the side. For whatever reason it was poured on and also came with a cup of it on the side. We agreed that the prices seemed a bit high for the experience. It has a similar feel to Bravo but service just isn't at that level yet (from our experience). Our sever did not know anything about the menu or what is fried in their fryers which should be expected at $18+ a plate. (We asked because of food allergies) She did however make sure to note allergies on our order which we appreciated! The music also did not match the setting. I really wanted to relax but the music was super up beat and almost had me rushing to leave. We will try again in a few months and I'll update my review then."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant 3 times now and really enjoy it.  I do wish they would advertise because it's always empty.  The pork chop (which I would never normally order) was highly recommended by my server and is now my favorite dish!  The menu has a good variety and I have always been pleased with the food and service."}
{"text":"Like others \"Market\" in the name threw us but we decided to try based on the many good reviews. The food was all delicious, actually surprisingly good for essentially a strip mall restaurant.  Dining room was simple but nice and there is a fantastic looking bar. I don't drink so I can't comment on the adult beverages. Service was adequate but I would have expected more (the main reason I gave them 4 stars) especially considering the really good food. Definitely will return but prices are a bit high for just a quick casual weeknight dinner."}
{"text":"In The Fountains shopping center off Ardrey Kell Road, you may not see this great find too often. But what a GREAT local place that consistently serves quality selections. I have noticed everything is done well here. Setting, service, and food. Salads are very fresh. Always a good soup of the day.  Good wine selection too. Pastas are good choice, and some unique Peruvian options.  Try this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Love love love this place the food is amazing.  And our waiter Trey knows how to take care of his customers."}
{"text":"I have been to circles a few times now and I have never been disappointed.  The food is excellent and served hot.  The service and atmosphere are lovely and everyone is so nice and welcoming.  I love that the patio is pet friendly and there are local craft beers on tap!  Loved it!!!!"}
{"text":"Market. Where? Circles. What? Grill. Pasta? No calamari. No zucchini. No cheese on chicken parmesan. The mussels on the house are excellent. Not sure why they serve you a different gravy with chicken. Ravioli was not fresh. Disappointed. Sauce was good. Will we come back? Sadly no. Too pricey for meh."}
