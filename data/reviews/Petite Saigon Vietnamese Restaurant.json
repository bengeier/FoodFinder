{"text":"Best Vietnamese in Airdrie, hands down.  Fast, friendly, and cheap.  Try the sate pho!"}
{"text":"Not worth the stop. 

We tried a crispy noodle dish and the Wor Wonton soup. Certainly wouldn't try them again. 

We tried it since the other local Vietnamese place was closed on Sunday. I've been to the other place a few times, and it was great. Since the reviews were generally positive, we figured why not...  sad that the meal wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"OPEN sign was off but the restaurant was open so if you want in, make sure and double check just in case. It was after-hours for lunch and there was no one inside except the cashier, her son and the mom that does all the cooking.
I love supporting family run businesses so thought I would give it a shot. They were great to talk to.
The decor was typical, a bit run down, not much to look at. 
I ordered what was popular, a #32 (chargrilled pork and spring rolls on vermicelli) and asked for it to go.
It was ready quickly, as in seconds. I had hoped this was a good thing? Or an OK thing?
The food overall was alright, looked good but lacked seasoning in every bite. If you are on a sodium free diet, this would be your place without worry. There was no way I could eat it without bringing it home and fixing it up a little. Sadly most of it is sitting in the fridge."}

{"text":"I stumbled upon Petite Saigon in Airdrie whilst antiquing at the nearby Where On Earth... Did You Get That? antique mall (the two establishments share a parking lot). After hours of poking through dusty books and bone china, I wandered over to Petite Saigon for dinner. The menu offers a wide and mouthwatering selection with all the staple favourites. A daily special offers approximately $2 off regular prices and, as with many Vietnamese restaurants, the portion sizes were nothing to sneeze at.

My table ordered a number of diverse items, from salad rolls to wor-wonton soup, to the quintessential fried egg and grilled pork chops on vermicelli. Having had the opportunity to sample a little of everything my family ordered, I found it all delicious. Expertly and timely cooked and delivered, the pork chops were succulent and beautifully-seasoned; the soup rich, with a tasty broth that was neither too salty nor not salty enough. And any Vietnamese meal is, in my mind, somewhat incomplete without a steaming cup of Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk - which was perfect.

The decor was homey and oddly-mixed, featuring Asian-inspired art alongside taxidermy animal heads - I assumed an homage to the Alberta landscape. Multiple fish tanks lined the back walls hosting an array creatures large and small. The service was friendly and prompt.

I was surprised when I checked in that no one had ever reviewed Petite Saigon before and I'm happy to provide it's first glowing review. Simply put, Petite Saigon offered delicious food at a reasonable price that I would be happy to indulge in again."}
{"text":"Since it was our first time trying Vietnamese, the hostess helped us understand what we were looking at.  Basically, there are spring rolls (veggie option as well), soup dishes, and vermicelli noodle dishes.  I had a chicken + spring roll on noodles, and it was really good!  Kids had a kid bowl of chicken and noodles, and they loved that!  I would def go again!"}
{"text":"Really friendly, attentive service, decent Vietnamese food, good prices. Locally owned and family run!

Gave 3 instead of 4 stars because the food is really average. Not bad, just not awesome. Clean but a little run-down."}
