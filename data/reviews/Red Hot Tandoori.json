{"text":"Super underrated Bangladeshi place (even though it claims Indian/Pakistani cuisine). And very affordable too! Beef and lamb biryani ~$8 and chicken biryani is ~$5. I tried the beef biryani which was AH-MAZING! Reminds me of beef tehari (a type of biryani where you use mustard oil). Lamb Biryani was my favourite though, tender meat, great flavours, authentic taste. They also have Aloo Chop which is kind of like a breaded potato pancake, a staple evening snack in traditional Bangladeshi homes. It tastes similar to aloo tikki or a latke but even better! Each aloo chop is like a dollar or so. They take time making their food so it come warm and fresh. You can see that the chilli is still green which means they were just put in. Spicy level might be a bit high for North American pallettes so don't forget to request the chef for a medium spicy version. The spicy level for me was perfect though.  Most authentic Bangladeshi biryani found here. Period."}

{"text":"The owner is friendly, and the menu options are straight forward. The food was promptly prepared and served.   I ordered the Beef Briyani, which was well favoured with spices and cloves, for $8. The portion is generous although it is mostly spiced rice. The rice is a bit dry and the spices are mostly in the rice as opposed to the meat, but it was still good. It was served with a small side salad with homemade dressing (very tasty), and a hard boiled egg. I also ordered the Lassi, which is a yogurt drink; this one was mango flavored and was great.  The decor is retro and a bit grimey, but overall it is still clean. Water is self serve. Cash only."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to eat after a hike in the nearby Taylor Creek trail. Found this place on Yelp. Had two 5 star reviews. Was skeptical if it was any good but decided to try it anyways as it was not too far. There is nothing much in terms of decor. A place where you got your food and are your meal. I ordered the Chicken Biryani, while my friends ordered Beef and Goat curries with naan. Biryani was good. Came with an egg and two pieces of chicken. All of our dishes came with salad but they didn't look good and I didn't eat it. Anyways the salad was just extra and Biryani was well worth $5.99. The place is mostly self serve however the owner was friendly."}
{"text":"This is a family indian restaurant.   Very simple and you could tell that it is family operated.   The owner works at the front.   The restaurant is very simple and there is nothing outstanding about it.  Some would say this place is unkempt but that's because the owner is himself just a small operator trying to make a living for his family.  This is not an easy restaurant to find.   It's pretty much in an old strip of the danforth.   I ordered the chicken biryani and mango lassi.  The chicken biriyani was for 5.99 which is an amazing price for those craving indian food but at a tight budget.   the mango lassi was pretty good too.   For those that can't take spicy, get the lassi as well for $2.     Don't forget to get their naan too.  They are freshly oven baked and they are amazing.  If I am in the area and I am looking for indian food, I'd drop by."}
