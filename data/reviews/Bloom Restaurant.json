{"text":"Went in the context of Winterlicious. Excellent food, though portions were a little on the small side. Service was excellent. Waiters were humorous, energetic, clear on details and very welcoming.  Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic winterlicious menu. Environment was great and we absolutely didn't mind the 10 minute wait even after having a reservation. But best of all. Thie restaurant has the absolute best customer service in the area. Everyone is super friendly and attentive . They gave us free drinks and food while we waited, and afterwards the owner came down and gave us a gift certificate. The duck , cevice and beef cheek is absolutely to die for on this menu. Keep up the great food and service !!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm! I've lived in the west end for almost five years now and have been hanging around here for a few more and had never eaten here before.  I've walked by on a number of occasions and looked in, but had never eaten. I decided to take my boyfriend out for a celebration of sorts.  However, my timing coincided with Winterlicious and I thought I would be out of luck.  Bloom accommodated us on a blustery Saturday night.  We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals and were impressed with the portions sizes. The bass and the cinnamon fritters were amazing.  It's really great that we may now have our cute little go-to!"}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant and the proprietors are the finest people. You will get excellent service and a lovely taste of Latin American cuisine. Bonus : Luis Mario Ochoa world renowned singer, composer, arranger plays there sometimes and has special guests join him so, great music in an intimate setting with world class acts. That's worth a few stars. I have been invited to perform with him on Sept 20 - a couple of sets of Latin and Jazz music to add to the already great vibe!"}
{"text":"Came for Winterlicious lunch on Saturday. A company of 3. One word to describe the experience: smooth.  As soon as we entered, we were promptly greeted, coats checked and brought to our table with menus in place. These guys were expecting us and they were ready.  We were granted adequate time to mull over the menu, and served water in the meantime. Then, with our \"decided\" composure at play, our server reemerged in minutes to take our orders.   To start, we had the croquettes and cassava/leak soup; for entree, a round of black squid ink paella; and for dessert, the guava bread pudding and chocolate-almond cake. We also tried their pisco sour and mojito drinks.   The drinks arrived first, and they were sufficiently boozy and refreshing. Not too sweet, just how I like it. The croquettes were crunchy and flavourful, paired with lavishly-garlicked kale (yum!) I tried my mother's soup, which was velvety (creamy), had depth of flavour, definitely scrumptious. The squid ink paella did not disappoint. The dish was well salted, spiced, and proportioned. We were most impressed by how they did not abuse the seafood! The calamari, shrimp, and mussel were not over-cooked, and they didn't taste of freezer-burn; they were tender and retained their delicate taste. For dessert, I enjoyed my guava bread pudding- moist, dense, and served with fresh berry compote. The chocolate cake had a nice ganache layer on the top, but the cake itself was a bit dry for my preference.   Overall, I had a nice dining experience. The staff are kind and sincere to their business. Each course was brought out with a nice cadence, it created time for conversation and anticipation of the next dish. We didn't feel rushed nor left in \"hanger\" (hunger-anger). It's a small, cozy restaurant with a convivial vibe. Looking forward to a return trip. Salud!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner and was pleasantly surprised by the warm welcome, but also by the exceptional food! Ceviche, calamari and paella was nothing like I have ever tasted before! The flavors were exemplary...kudos to the  Cuban chef! Our server Jordy, made our experience even more pleasurable with his attentiveness and contagious laughter. Amazing experience...I can't wait to go back! I would recommend to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Went to bloom for Winterlicious today. Beautiful decor, fantastic service, and great food!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend: phenomenal food, phenomenal atmosphere, and phenomenal service. Seriously though, the food was amazing."}
{"text":"I had dinner there and my meal, steak w/garlic mash and aspargus wasn't very special. My date had a lobster risotto with tomato, that turned out to be a tomato sauce risotto with lobster. The tomato sauce had a Campbell soup flavour. Ugh. That being said, when we mentioned that we weren't pleased the staff promptly removed the dish from the bill and threw in a round of drinks. The service there is SPECTACULAR!! The food needs to work up to the same calibur."}
{"text":"Outstanding service. We hadn't been here in a year but decided to return and were so thankful we did. We had the paella and ceviche and loved it. We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"We went tonight and there was a live Cuban band playing (Cuba Traditional).  They are amazing, talented, very energetic, and entertaining. The food was good but the portions were very small and pricey. Although was tasty."}
{"text":"We had been there a few times and really enjoyed, mostly, the food. This is what stands out of this restaurant, THE FOOD. It is a little pricey for what you get as portions are small but you get satisfied.  My 2 star review goes to CUSTOMER SERVICE though based on our last experience. The guy at the entrance (Chinese like) was very rude and looked very unpleasant when he saw we arrived with our baby. Then, we got a waitress named Patricia who asked us if we wanted water, we said yes, and she all of the sudden, opened up a bottle of San Pellegrino (which we never asked for) and we thought it was part of the fix price. Well, it was not, they charged $6 for a bottle, which I then asked her if I could get the bottle's top to take it home as it was almost full and she (as rude as you can be) said customers never do that and they left it there. Well, we never ask her opinion, a little respect lady for the customers who pay your salary. Not only that but she is so loud when she talks that the whole restaurant can hear your order or any comment she might've said. VERY UNPLEASANT, NOT COMING BACK."}
{"text":"Delicious food and terrific customer service. I had the steak frites and it was mouthwatering! My waiter recommended a perfect wine pairing. Amazing experience!"}
{"text":"My family and I went here for Winterlicious and it was my best 'licious experience yet. The food was fantastic and good sized portions. The ambiance was wonderful and the most courteous staff ever! Most stand-out dish was the pan-seared chicken. Cooked perfectly and paired with a unique veggie - anise! Apps and desserts were wonderful too. It was a table of very different palates, but everyone enjoyed themselves.If you get a chance to check it out for Winterlicious - GO!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for Winterlicious. After seeing all the good reviews it had on yelp, we decided to give it a shot. While the service offered by the waiters and waitresses were exemplary, and the food itself tasted great, it unfortunately fell short of our expectations in a few areas.  To address the good points, the waiters were amazingly accommodating and kind. The food was unique and delicious, and definitely a spot for some non-mainstream food. Decor was also lovely.  However, the wait time was disappointingly long, even with a booked reservation. We ended up waiting around 20-30 minutes to be seated after our reservation time. We witnessed a lot of other guests who had troubles with their reservations as well. It was clear that there were lots of frustrations about their booking and seating system.   The restaurant space itself was also quite tight and crowded. It wasn't very private and noise volumes got a bit uncomfortable. Tables were within a few centimetres apart from each other. For a restaurant that focuses more on quality over quantity, it definitely would've been nice to have some peacefulness while enjoying the food.   Overall, the service and food did somewhat balance the cons. I would definitely recommend coming here when it's less busy, as you'll probably have a much better experience!"}
{"text":"We popped in on a slow night and had the great pleasure of chatting with our waiter Pedro while enjoying the finest dinner of our lives. The service is outstanding: warm and attentive.   There is a great variety of dishes on the menu, including both meat and veggie options. We tried several dishes, including the kids meal chicken fingers for our son. Every single one was spectacular. Flavourful without being overpowering. I recommend the tostones and the aji de pollo.   You must try Bloom's. We are going back in a few days for the live music.  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"1 visit to bloom probably my last  I live in the area so most of my reviews are of BWV. This was a lunch with friend around 12:30.   Service;  We sat ourselves because no one greeted us at the door. We sat in the window seat . The waiter was friendly and gave us menus with the specials. He did not ask us to move or mention our window seat as we were the only customers there.   Close to the end of our meal , finishing our last bites approximately 35 Min's in, our waiter said we had to either move from the window seat or hurry and leave????? He said 2 people reserved the window seat and were waiting.  Not impressed!   Extras;  Yummy bread freshly baked or heated with house spread  Large pitcher of ice water on request because the glasses were so small   Food;  We both had the soup and salad  Soup was good , I had a hair but did not mention it  Salad was good but had way too much dressing  The best part of the meal was the bread  No butter available   Ambiance ;  Seating comfortable  Window seat nice while it lasted  Restaurant is on the colder side - bring a sweater    Probably wont return because the food was not that great and waiter turned me off"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in Bloor West Village, so don't be shocked at the prices.  It is owned by Cuban expats and they have integrated some of their traditional cuisine into the main dishes.  Ambiance was nice and casual.  Although most of the crowd were well-dressed, as is the norm in that part of town, the staff did not treat us like second-class customers because we were not dressed to impress and we had two small kids in our party.  On to the food!!  I am currently on a high protein, low-carb diet, so I had to order something that did not have rice (the paella was clearly OUT) or pasta and...well you know the deal.  I ordered the Pollo Asado ($22), which was stuffed with spinach and manchego cheese.  Now, I am a sucker for manchego cheese, which I consider one of the world's best (especially with some serrano ham...), so this dish was a no-brainer.  The waiter recommended I substitute their Cassava fries for the garlic mash.  Either one was a no-no for my diet, but I got the fries anyway and just had my friends eat it.  Alright, I did eat TWO fries...and they were FANTASTIC!!....:P  The chicken was perfectly seasoned, for my taste, and was just enough of a serving for me to get full.  I was savoring every bite with a little of the truffle jus!!  The stuffing was delicious, with the potency of the cheese still present, albeit lessened somewhat mixed with the spinach.  I also tried a little bit of the ceviche appetizer ($13), served in a parfait-looking glass.  It was wonderful!!!  It wasn't TOO lemony, and I couldn't even taste that cilantro \"taste\" that I loathe with a passion!  I should add that I used Yelp's check-in option while I was eating at this place and was pleasantly surprised to get a pop-up coupon - $25 for a Price-Fixe meal!!  BONUS!  Two people at my table had ordered the $35 Price-Fixe meal, so i figured this was a coupon for $10 off that particular menu option.  Well, I was wrong.  Apparently, there is a separate set of dishes that comprise the meal you get with the $25 coupon.  No big deal.  I wasn't expecting the coupon anyway, so no harm no foul!  I later found out that the $25 gets you the \"Cuban\" price-fixe set of dishes, which is described on their website, but not on their actual in-restaurant menu (kind of like Burger's Priest \"secret menu...).  The owner was apologetic (the coupon didn't really indicate that there was a separate menu item that corresponded to it) and she gave us 2 \"Bloom Bucks\", which were good for $20.00 off our next tab.  Now THAT was going above and beyond even though everything would have been fine if she had not!!!  Good service alone gets me to come back to a place at least one more time...even if the food is so-so; however, pair great dishes with service that is just as good...I'm definitely coming back and will also recommend the place.  I'll most likely return when I can reintroduce carbs into my diet again!!"}
{"text":"Situé sur la rue Bloor, à l'Ouest de Runnemede, Bloom est un restaurant spécialisé dans la cuisine d'Amérique centrale et d'Amérique du Sud. Le cuisinier cubain organise régulièrement des semaines à thème, présentant la cuisine typique d'un pays du continent.   La qualité des mets est excellente et le service est très bon. Nous y avons goûté des empanadas et des chuleta et nos quatre compagnons étaient tous ravis par leurs choix respectifs. Nous avons hâte d'y retourner après le festival culinaire de Winterlicious."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try out this lovely intimate gem (after reading some great reviews). We arrived around 9pm, and were graciously seated in to a candlelit booth. We felt the warm hospitality and ambience as soon as we walked in. A pleasant Peruvian gentleman greeted us at our table and encouraged us to be \"adventurous\" with our beverage choice - he recommended the Pesco sour and it was sooo delicious! Our meal was absolute perfection - from the yuca frita & croquettes to the pollo relleno! The dessert was also spectacular - flan & guava empanadas...mm Mmm mm! We were able to meet the Cuban chef behind the mastery which was great, and we left feeling completely satisfied and will definitely be back for more adventure! Thank-you!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food with impeccable service.  Not the fanciest of digs, but definitely a quality place to eat a great tasting, well presented meal for a reasonable price. Will definitely repeat.!"}
{"text":"To start off, service is amazing - so friendly and accommodating!  Food is delicious and the restaurant is very intimate - a little small.  We went for Winterlicious and at first I thought the portions were too small but the timing that the food came out was so perfect that I was full and not at all bloated.  As for the cost, I did not look at the regular menu but I am pretty sure it is a little more than average but not too bad."}
{"text":"We visited Bloom as part of our 10 year dating anniversary and ate off their Winterlicious menu. The food was delicious and the staff were SO friendly and sweet! Can't wait to return"}
{"text":"First time coming to Bloom and I was pleasantly surprised. The service was outstanding and the food was amazing!!  This will be my new default place to go when we want to have dinner close to home."}
{"text":"Great food and service in high park area!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is just perfect in all aspects. The bisque soup from halibut was very good and the lamb cooked as expected.  The Malbec from Argentine was also delicious. In addition the service was excellent. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Came here to try the Winterlicious menu but I was dissapointed. Even though the meal was delicious, the atmosphere made the experience worse. I would like to try this restaurant on another day to see if it improves but for now I would not recommend it.  Pros - The waiters were very accommodating and tried their best to make us have a good time. Someone's reservation didn't go through so they gave him a $50 voucher. - The food was the best part of the experience! They only had the winterlicious menu but I'm glad they only focused on that.  Cons - The structure of the place felt very cheap. I saw peeling wallpaper and the stairs seemed like they could break any minute. The washrooms also had a very small amount of toilet paper and the accessories (paper towel holder and sink) were in very poor condition - Even though the meal was delicious, we were unable to order one out of four items on the menu - It can get loud. I could barely hear my girlfriend talk at times - They had an online reservation issue which caused large amount of people to wait until a table was cleared. We waited 10 minutes while many others came and left due to the wait time - The space where you wait is very tight. We had to squeeze in to allow for people/waiters to pass"}
{"text":"We went there for summerlicious dinner, the service and internal deco are great!! We ordered salmon and such for starter, bison rib and duck for main dish, Apple and cheese cake for dessert, the starter and dessert were excellent, but main dish is kind of ordinary, the bison tasted very plain and duck was chewy, didn't match the restaurant's reviews and our expectation. Maybe we should try their regular menu someday."}
{"text":"This spot has everything I want in a dinner away from home. Bloom had nice soft ambience, friendly service, welcoming hosts and delicious food! I'm an eater and I dined at bloom with my chef friend. He was most impressed as well. I left feeling satisfied, happy and mellow I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place to eat. The sandwich selections were very unique everything was delicious. Good friendly service !"}
{"text":"Delicious and inventive food.  The ceviches are very fresh and uniquely flavoured.  I had the paella which was teeming with fresh seafood.  I could not finish it but that was ok as the sauce I know will be even better after a day.  Service is great and consistent.  No wonder why this place has been here for over a decade.  It still gets packed on Saturday evening.  This is a great place to revivify your palate and taste for great flavours!"}
{"text":"Hola!  This is a chic and stylish resto in Bloor West.  Service is friendly  and the beautiful people eat here in their black dresses and dress shirts, and casually dressed people as well!  On a Friday night at 8pm it was almost at capacity.  It's a cozy spot that makes full use of the space.  The menu has a fantastic range of delights.  We ordered the ensalada, grilled beef heart, and carpaccio to start. All the food is beautifully presented.    The anticuchos - beef heart and the salad it comes with was absolutely delicious and I could eat that as a main never mind appetizer size.  The kale beet salad was also delicious.  The carpaccio was a disappointment.  Describes as coming with a vinaigrette and guacamole, the beef was not thinly sliced, which is what I'm used to, although it was definitely fresh.  I could not discern any specific flavour from the vinaigrette other than oil, guacamole = cubes of avocado, and thin slices of a mild cheese that, if salty, would have complemented the beef and avocado.  The crispy super thin crostini was a nice complement to the dish.  They were all fresh ingredients but it was a bland dish at best.  Main was chupe des mariscos (seafood in a sauce).  That dish was also delicious and all the seafood was perfectly cooked.  Service was faultless, attentive, friendly, warm, and welcoming.  Worth another visit for sure!  Muchas gracias por una agradable velada!!"}
{"text":"My first summerlicious of the season!  And it didn't disappoint.  Bloom is right in my neighbourhood but I've never been because it's a little more than I try to spend on a regular basis.  My DC and I often try restaurants together, and although she lives in the neighbourhood too, we've never gone together to a restaurant in our area.  So we decided to change that!    First off, it really is a lovely little place.  The seating is super comfy, whether you're on the bench or the chairs, which I always appreciate.  I enjoy skooshy furniture.  The atmosphere really sets the mood for the dining experience.  Another extra that I really liked was that they put their summerlicious menu into an actual menu, rather than just having it printed off as I've seen in some other establishments.  The service was also fantastic, I can't say enough about that.  My water glass was never empty, and I tend to drink a lot of water.  And what's better is that they weren't intrusive about it.  Just the standard checking in on each course, but then our conversation wasn't interrupted.  They would just come by and silently fill the glass if necessary.  Loved it!    On to the food...for starters I had the prosciutto-wrapped chicken and my DC the gazpacho.  Both dishes were beautifully presented and were not lacking on the taste front either.  The guava foam that accompanied my chicken was especially interesting to me.  I'm not the biggest fan of frisee though, I find it doesn't have much flavour and is a little difficult to eat tidily.  I was a little surprised that the gazpacho was pinkish in colour, since it was described as being a cucumber soup?  But my friend said nothing and seemed to really enjoy it.    For mains, we both went with the flank steak cooked medium-rare.  Again, beautiful presentation.  The chimichurri pesto on top wasn't really my thing, to be honest.  It looked pretty but I didn't find that it really enhanced the taste.  The steak was cooked very well, a little more rare than I was expecting, but still good.  It was also pre-sliced into three pieces that had been seared on their sides.  Very tasty steak for sure.  The yucca fries were fantastic; I wish there had been more than three.    As for desserts, I ordered the \"Nutella and Spicy Chocolate Layer Cake\" and my friend the churros with dulce de leche ice cream.  I'm not a big fan of churros myself, but the ice cream that I tried was divine.  My cake however...it was good.  It was tasty.  But it was not what I expected at all.  First, it was pretty small.  It was a rectangle smaller than a post-it.  And it wasn't chocolate.  I'm not sure what the layers were, but I was expecting a big chocolate cake with some nutella in there, and some kind of chili spice to it.  The only thing that I got right was the nutella.  The thin layer of frosting on top was definitely nutella.  But there was no detectable spice, and there was no chocolate cake.  The rest of it was white.  Still tasty...but not what I was expecting based on the description, and smaller than I would have hoped for.    All in all, it's a restaurant with a very nice atmosphere, fantastic service, and good food - but not great food.  I will add that my friend seemed to enjoy it immensely and had no complaints.  I would give the food three stars, but the service, presentation and the atmosphere deserve another."}
{"text":"Came here for an 8:30pm dinner during Summerlicious on a Friday night. The restaurant is small, seating about 50 people and has a fresh, clean, bright ambiance.  The host and wait staff were all very personable and made me feel comfortable right off the bat.  Between my dining companion and I we ordered the Calamari and Ceviche for appetizers. The calamari was tough but the ceviche was great (tender pieces of assorted seafood in a zesty lemon/lime dressing).  For mains we had the apparent crowd favorite (as the majority of people seated around us also ordered it) Beef Tenderloin Skewers, and the Salmon.  The Salmon was OK, nothing to write home about, but the Tenderloin Skewers and accompanying deep fried Jicama (Mexican yam) and grilled vegetables were superb. The beef was tender, almost buttery and paired with the salty Jicama, fresh chimichurri and perfectly crunchy grilled veggies it was the best meal I've had in some time.  For dessert we had the Guava Bread Pudding and Flourless Chocolate Cake. Don't waste your time with the cake and go straight for the pudding that was unlike anything I've ever had; soft, light, semi-sweet and fruity but not runny or too juicy.   Overall a great first impression of the service and food. The only downside was the slightly overpriced and underwhelming cocktails.  The caipirinha, which tasted just like margarita, was $10 for a what I thought was a small portion and didn't come with a sugar cane slice. The mojito was also $10 and was again just OK.  With that said, my overall impression is quite favourable; it would not take much to convince me to return.  On side note: During our meal the host came around to each table and told us that one of the tables was celebrating a birthday and asked if we would sing happy birthday when they brought the cake out. At the time I though it a bit strange, but in retrospect it was quite a nice touch to the evening as the whole restaurant united for the song when the cake was brought out much to the surprise and appreciation of the birthday recipient. I though that this was a real Latin twist on our dining experience that I believe Bloom Restaurant embodies."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and personable servers, however, the food was quite mediocre. I came here for Winterlicious, knowing full well that the portions will he small, however, the portions were extra small, I found. The servers were kind enough, and really accommodated us, however the relaxing ambiance and personable servers unfortunately didn't offset the ordinary taste of the food on the Winterlicious menu."}
{"text":"Dinner was AMAZING...very delicioso will be returning 100%, glad we made the choice to try this restaurant- I travel to NYC and always take advantage of Latin/Cuban food; so happy I found a place closer to home-"}
{"text":"Went to Bloom for Summerlicious and, as it should be, the best thing about this restaurant is the food.  My mouth was entertained from appetizer through to the dessert!  We had the Aji De Gallina (Peruvian Style Chicken) from their $35 Summerlicious menu and we were wowed, savouring every bite.  For dessert, we had the Soursop Mousse with Passion fruit (FANTASTIC) and the Caramel and Guava Pudding (AMAZING).  This is the kind of restaurant where the portion sizes don't matter, the taste and flavours are that good.  Why didn't I give it a 5/5?  I love that they take online reservations but when we got there they didn't have my registration on paper despite getting email confirmation that my reservation was accepted.  Also, I let them know that the occasion was for my wife's birthday but we didn't get the special sparkler birthday dessert that a couple other tables got, and that was pretty disappointing.  In summary, Bloom is a great restaurant, with a contemporary atmosphere and decor, and WONDERFUL food."}
{"text":"Came for our anniversary dinner and it was amazing. THE best food in Bloor West Village. Stellar service. Definitely returning."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyable and delicious Summerlicious lunch on a relaxed Saturday. First time trying Nuevo Latino and Chef Pedro Quintanilla made ours a delightful experience.   Plating, texture, and flavour of the dishes were thoughtful and creative. We were very pleased to have tried: duck tostadas, salad with palm hearts, salmon terrine, guava cheese cake, and apple empanada.   We had a reservation for 11am but apparently the restaurant didn't open until 11:30. Nonetheless, Chef Pedro accommodated us graciously. We were seated and served tout de suite. The gentleman who later came in later and was our server... he was visibly vexed at having patrons earlier than Bloom's business hours. His manner was brusque and relatively more inattentive and less gracious than I had expected and when compared to the Chef himself. Perhaps this was a one-off.  Anyhow, for the food: 10/10 would revisit and try Bloom outside of summer/winterlicious."}
{"text":"Ordered Uber eats from this place. Wow- just what I was looking for. This food is made with love!   Got the Cubano sandwich. Big portion and it tastes better than what you get in Cuba!  Now onto the paella a la habanera - get it. This dish alone should be rated 5 stars.   Definitely a new favourite, plus the convenience of getting it delivered to your door. It's a win-win!"}
{"text":"We came to this unassuming place for summerlicious (it was the only place to participate in summerlicious in Bloor West Village) and were very pleasantly surprised. The decor is kind of confused and modern fusion-esque, with Frank Sinatra prints mixed with Latin tribal decor. The food however was very very good. I remember a wonderful cold kale gazpacho, crab smothered in a piquant sauce on mashed purple potatoes,  perfectly medium rare sirloin, delightful cassava chips, and lovely leche chocolate cake for dessert. Service was quick and efficient. The place was packed for the lunch service within 20 minutes but they managed to keep the food coming at a steady pace."}
{"text":"The flower is definitely back on The Bloom on Bloor Street.  I used to be fairly regular at this Bloor West destination but dining competition is fierce and after a few visits at Bloom the menu lost its lustre for me.  Then by chance a food writer friend of mine invited me to what I refer to as a \"soft re-opening\" of the restaurant.  Immediately I noticed there seemed to be a different, fresh vibe in the dining room.    The wall colour isn't the only thing different at Bloom.  The new man behind the doors in the kitchen, Chef Pedro Quintanilla, whose background in Cuban cooking, turned the menu on its ear with his blend of Latin dishes.  Surrounded by my food tweeps we settled in for a glimpse to what we could expect from the newly refaced Bloom restaurant.    The hosts welcomed us with some lovely light cocktail offerings of Bloom Mojitos or the Blooming Buds.  Both were refreshing and a great way to start up the evening.  The opening act was Cassava Frites garnished with Mojo dipping sauce.  Anything with the word mojo in it is like that moment in the film \"Jerry Maguire\" with the old \"you had at me at hello\" line.  It was a perfect Amuse Bouche and got my taste buds all roaring and ready to go.   Starters were a choice between Ceviche or a Spring Terrine.  In my wisdom I buddied up with a Food Tweep and we struck an agreement to each order the opposite and share our plates so we could get to try it all.  The Spring Terrine (chicken liver & foie gras) was sided with crostini,  two crispy onion rings and stems of freshly steamed aspargus.  Kudos to the kitchen for not turning the asparagus into stringy sticks of greeness. On an ethical food note,  Bloom is committed to using sustainable fish,  bravo to the management for recognizing the importance of a sustainable seafood supply.  The fish was cured in lime juice, habanero peppers and cilantro.  It had some attitude and I was down with that.  Although the Ceviche we had that evening was a bit chewier than I prefer, the lime juice with the Habanero really kicked it up a notch.  For me the winner was the Spring Terrine.  I have since again tried the Ceviche, which really is a house specialty, and the second time was much better.    For mains, the choice was Sesame Crusted Ahi Tuna Fillet with crispy spuds, roasted veggies drizzled with a tofu-wasabi dressing or a pan seared Flank Steak topped with a Chimichurri Sauce, sided with garlic mashed potatoes and ginger glazed carrots.  The fish was cooked perfectly with the sesame creating a very dry crust.  I have eaten my share of Chimichurri over the years but hands down the Chimichurri atop a seared rare sliced pile of flank steak was freakishly delicious.    Most restaurants make the Chimichurri in a food processor, turning it into what most would say looked more like Pesto.  This Chimichurri had real body to it. It wasn't runny but rather sat like a firm condiment across the meat.  I later learned from Chef Quintanilla that he hand chops the Chimichurri which explains the consistency.  It also told me volumes about the calibre of the food he sends out of the kitchen.    While I liked the Tuna, I'm a meat loving kinda girl and the flank steak was a home run.  Just writing about that Chimichurri on the steak makes my mouth water.  A mouthful of that meat and those garlic mashed potatoes was a food love affair in my mouth.    Bring on the sweets!  The evening choices consisted of Churros (insert drool strings here) with warm chocolate sauce and ice cream or a Cuban Dulce de Leche flan with Thyme.  The Churros was much more tiny than what I am accustomed to.  The killer though was the warm chocolate sauce that was edgy with a slight tang of heat and cinnamon.  The Dulce de Leche flan was true to flan style and was pretty much spot on although I'm not sure I could taste the Thyme.   The winner for the sweets of the evening, without question, had to be those crispy little Churros drizzled with that chocolate sauce.    Malivoire wines were the accompanying libations.  They included a 2009 Pinot Gris, a 2007 (which by far and away was one of the best years for wine in Ontario) Pinot Noir and for dessert a 2008 Icewine Riesling was served.  All worked well with the food but for me I was feeling the love for the Pinot.    I'm definitely adding Bloom back to my restaurant destination list.  It's a great date spot, a great spot to get together with your girlie pals or just a lovely, low key spot to kick back and enjoy a decent meal.  The new menu at Bloom is worth a look at.  You don't want to miss out on that Chimichurri and the Churros are plate licking worthy!  Like I said, the flower is definitely back on the Bloom!    Couple of quick notes;  Bloom offers a BYOW with corkage of $10 bucks Tues-Thurs, $20 Fri-Sat."}
{"text":"Small cozy place to have a romantic date. Warm welcome nice servants. Easy place to have dilicious food."}
{"text":"To say my boyfriend and I had a wonderful experience here is not enough. From the moment we stepped inside, we were greeted by everyone with great warmth and hospitality. This extended throughout our meal at Bloom. The hosts, owners, and support staff engaged with every patron like they were dear friends.  The food was carefully thought out and well put together. We were both very happy with the quality of our meal and the care put in to it.  We're new to the area and are looking for a new favorite restaurant and it looks like we may have found it.  I would also like to add that I have never reviewed a restaurant online before, but this place deserves credit."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to kick off the Winterlicious season by dining at Bloom restaurant. From the onset, the atmosphere was very warm and friendly. The waitstaff are clearly passionate about the restaurant and cuisine that they serve. They are happy to answer questions about the dishes and provide recommendations if you are having trouble deciding what to order.   Between the two of us, we tried the Pisco sour, Fabada Asturania (white bean, chorizo and bacon soup, Tilapia ceviche (I am not a fan of seafood but decided to give this a shot to live a little! I am so glad I did!), Pato Asado (sugarcane marinated duck), Guava bread pudding (intriguing concept, amazing flavour!) and chocolate tres leches cake. The drinks and dishes were perfectly balanced.   By far, this is the best Winterlicious meal I have had to date! Will definitely be returning for another meal especially since the live music is available on certain nights!"}
{"text":"Bloom is a brilliant restaurant. It's a gem hidden away in the west end of the city. I have been several times now, and have yet to be disappointed. The interior of the restaurant is quite nice. A handful of tables line the wall along the left side of the restaurant and end at the bar. White brick walls contrast the smooth red ceiling nicely. On the right are a few larger tables and a booth of sorts. The place is dimly lit, which is what makes it look closed from the outside when you peer in through tinted glass. I wanted to steal the chair I was sitting on, but didn't think I'd be able to sneak it out of the store. The food is great. (It's sort of Italian, but not quite.)  They have a small menu that changes often, which you can view on their website. This is a great place to take a date."}
{"text":"This was a last minute pick on the last day of winterlicious since all our first choices had no reservations for our group size and time. Ample paid street parking and if you don't mind walking a few minutes lots of side street parking too! With low expectations, we had an amazing experience. The food was really really good. I had the octopus salad, pork belly roll, and guava bread pudding. All 3 dishes were great. Octopus was not overcooked, fresh garden salad brought nice balance. Pork belly was tender, juicy. The pickled cabbage was very refreshing. And the bread pudding.. Supposedly a recipe from the chef's grandmother! I could have had their entire batch and then some. My friends ordered the mushroom soup and venison. The mushroom soup was warm, full flavoured. And they said the venison was amazing. Our sangrias were delicious. You get a full medium pitcher of the good stuff, they don't try to give you less by filling it with ice. However a bit pricey @ $35/ pitcher. It's also as much as our Prix fixed menu which was $38. Anyways, 3 pitchers later and we had zero regrets lol. Good company, good food, good drinks. Only downside to our experience  was that we wanted to order their paella on the side on top of our winterlicious menu but they couldn't make it happen as they would be all out of ingredients lol. We had a birthday girl with us and she received complimentary flute of champagne and cake. Service was above and beyond. Would definitely come back and would recommend to others. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Bloom Restaurant is a fantastic place to experience modernized Latin American food.  My friend and I chose this restaurant mainly because we've never had Latin American food and summerlicious special was going on.   Upon arriving, we were greeted by Pedro and then waited by Jordi.  Not only were they were very friendly and provided great service, they even took the effort to learn and remember our names.  During our time there, the service was outstanding.    The food was absolutely amazing.  The portions were perfect -  not too small so you'll enjoy it but not too big such that it fills you too full to eat subsequent rounds or feeling uncomfortable.  I ordered: calamari, salmon and the ice-cream log.  Calamari was perfectly grilled and paired very well with a light crisp salad.   I'm usually quite hesitant to order salmon because many restaurants tend to overcook it.  But it was not the case, the salmon was perfectly grilled - soft flavourful on the inside with a crisp beautiful exterior.  The salmon paired well with quinoa.  The ice-cream log was good too - it had an interesting almond texture and taste but, however, I thought my friend's bread pudding was better.      Overall - it was a great dining experience.  Although I live all the way in Scarborough and my friend lives in Richmond Hill (i.e. very far), I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"lime green wall with a slanted ceiling on one side, and a more white and dim ambiance further into the restaurant.  inviting.  we were welcomed and seated warmly by numerous waitstaff.  one of them, pedro, was friendly and funny.  he took his time to thoroughly explain the daily specials. our party of five ended up ordering:  - red sangria: a bit too much juice (pulpy and opaque), but tasty nonetheless.  my mom had like half the pitcher.  happy mother's day mom! - blue cheese & poached pear salad (on the house!): mixed greens and a sweet balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  delicious.  blue cheese and pear complement each other phenomenally - chef's daily selection ceviche: pedro mentioned that it was a scallop ceviche for the day, but we were pretty convinced it was lobster once we tried some of it.  nice and tangy, with some interesting kinds of corn in there - appetizer of the day: a plate of 1. a thick plantain slice stuffed with black beans and manchego cheese, 2. one seared scallop, and 3. a small portion of mango salsa.  probably the best appetizer we had.  the plantain was something really unique and well put together.  the scallop was cooked perfectly - the browned part was delicious, and the sear kept the raw-ish delicate texture on the inside - pulpo a la parrilla: grilled pieces of citrusy, tender octopus served with fried plantains and salad.  liked this one a lot  - rollo de lechon: this is supposed to come with pork belly, but they ran out and substituted a pork steak instead.  i don't normally like pork steaks but this one was cooked to a nice soft texture.  served with a black bean and rice mixture, as well as some salad and fried plantains.  good stuff - paella al habanera: just some straight up, damn good paella. loaded with chorizo and seafood - pollo relleno: chorizo-stuffed chicken.  very tender, with a strong flavour kick from the chorizo. loved it - lobster tail special: grilled and served with their quinoa mixture and salad.  the lobster was a bit salty, but was well cooked and full of tangy salsa flavour.  excellent - pernil de cordero: red wine braised lamb shank served over mashed potatoes and vegetables.  the sauce didn't have a distinct taste, but it still went really well with the lamb.  tied with the paella for my favourite main course  - guava bread pudding: apparently the chef's grandma's home recipe.  nice firm croissant-based pudding block that seems to have a bit of guava flavour in its mixture.  subtle, but good.  topped with some berries and whip cream  everything was kinda pricey, but very reasonable.  maybe except for the $35 pitcher of sangria.  reasonable wait times, and friendly service.  overall we had a really good experience here, and got to try some new and unique flavours.  we would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Such a hidden gem! Food is amazing. The flavors WAKE YOU UP. A breath of fresh and unpretentious air amongst all the overly stylized and salty restos in Toronto. Check it out and you won't be disappointed. It can be on the pricier side but I would pay the extra for something extraordinary and than average for average."}
{"text":"1st time at Bloom Restaurant via Winterlicious. The items on the Licious menu I chose were all pretty good albeit portions are on the small side. The Fabada, Chicken Fricassee, and Bread Pudding had filled me up but probably not to the extent that feels is worth $28. The Chicken Fricassee could definitely use more rice considering how large the plate was - yes, I know it's a Winterlicious portion.  Service in general was okay. I highly suggest larger cups as I often needed to drink water to accompany the food. Perhaps let customers keep a pitcher at their table?  Overall, I enjoyed my 1st time experience here. I would recommend to all."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! Went there to celebrate our daughter's last day of University. Incredible food and the staff made you feel like you had known them for years. The service was top notch...definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday as a date night.    Ambiance( 4 stars) A cosy place, we were there when it was pretty empty so did not feel the discomfort other people did.    Service (5+ stars): The owner, Pedro, is extremely charismatic.  He was the main waiter for us, and was extremely pleasant and gave great suggestions for food and drinks.   We were originally interested in Mojitos, but he suggested we try 'Pisco sour' instead as it is Peruvian classical drink.  He told us if we do not like it, he would give us Mojito free of charge.  The drink was amazing and we decided to follow his suggestion on food as well.  Food: (5 stars) We got a lentil soup and civice as starters.  Pedro served them to us already spit up, so we did not have to awkward sharing of the soup.   Both were really good. For the main meal we decided to get Paella.   (5 stars) For desert we got the bread pudding, a tad to sweet for my liking. (4.5 stars).  Cost:   With everything the cost was $120 before tip.  On the expensive side but generally worth it."}
{"text":"I made reservations here after purchasing a Groupon voucher. I read the reviews and looked at the website before my visit, so I was expecting something a bit more upscale based on the pricing. Don't get me wrong, this place is lovely and hardly ramshackle, but some of the chairs have seen better days and the decor seems more homey than haute.   I ordered the salad and crabcake appetizer for my dinner and my friend had the salmon entree. The menu changes from time to time so the selection is somewhat limited, albeit quite fresh. The salad was delicious with just the right blend of sweet and tangy, but for $9, this appetizer-sized salad needs to be outstanding (which it was).   The crab cake appetizer was surrounded with a thick sprinkling of... dust.  Yes, dust. What appeared to be cheese was the result of a voracious dish-polishing regime going on the kitchen. The server apologized profusely and reappeared with a replacement crab cake. This was decent, but for $16, I was a bit disappointed.  Overall the service was outstanding but the decor and food were priced a few points above what I thought they should have been."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here for this year's summerlicious, and it was amazing. The summerlicous menu food was so, so good and the service was also really awesome. The atmosphere was also very nice, i loved the music they played quietly in the background.  I'd totally come here for their live jazz sometime if i get a chance to."}
{"text":"I'm Latin and well traveler, really love food! Unfortunately I got very disappointed with the food at this place, nor much flavor and paid $70 for an average meal with very small portions. I don't recommend to visit this place."}
{"text":"Interesting little menu.  Got the Black Bean Soup and the cold tomato one. Both were nice and different. The place has its own unique flavour overall with everything. Got the beef tenders and salmon tacos.  The whole experience left me with a feeling of 'I gotta come back to try the other stuff on the menu'.... which is a good thing   The host/server was very warm and inviting."}
{"text":"Came to Bloom for a family dinner on a Saturday night.  This place is located in the lovely Bloor West Village. It's teeny tiny but cozy inside! You didn't feel like you were eating on top of the other diners. Pricey menu here, but the food was GREAT. The chef is cuban and cuisine is Latin American, a type that I really can't say I'm very familiar with. I had a peruvian appetizer consisting of mashed potatoes stuffed with minced meat, formed into a ball and fried with goat cheese...dang. It was GREAT!! It's not a part of their regular menu, but it should be!!  Others at the table got the Carpaccio (CARPACCIO Beef Tenderloin, Truffle Oil, Fleur De Sel, Fresh Lime Juice, Shaved Padano Cheese & Olive Oil-Garlic Crostini), and the Poblano Pepper (POBLANO PEPPER Stuffed with Beef & Pork Picadillo)...nobody could stop OOoh-ing and AAhhh-ing over their meals. The staff was amazing. They learned all of our names and addressed us by name throughout the night. The staff seemed to enjoy working there, and that really makes a difference to the enjoyment on the whole.  Great Place!"}
{"text":"I love Bloom. Pedro and the team are some of the kindest, most genuine people you will meet. Their only concern is the comfort and happiness of their diners. They really go the extra mile. The food is beautifully prepared, clearly with love and devotion to what they are doing. When it gets busy, be prepared to wait a little longer for your food and drinks - just relax and enjoy. In all the years I have been going there, I don't think I have seen staff turn over even once. Same people serving really well-prepared food together with delicious drinks in a lovely room. It stands alone in Bloor West Village for these traits."}
{"text":"Friendly service, great atmosphere and amazing food! Will be back for sure! We were lucky to have had a table without makig a reservation!"}
{"text":"Pleasant but food was underwhelming.  The service was good and the menu was interesting but the food did not wow me.  I would be willing to give them another chance but I have to admit I was hoping for a little bit more."}
{"text":"Summerlicious ($35) at Bloom Restaurant was quite delicious.   Summer rain and me forgetting my wallet resulted in me being over 30 minutes late for my reservation. The staffs did find a table for me but my Yelp Drinking Buddy who was busy drinking down the street was later than me, so I ended up ordering one of their Martini Sparkling Pom ($12) which was delicious...   My eating arrangement with my YDB is that we always that we have to order something different so I am stuck with   Appetizer: Prosciutto-wrapped Chicken With Frisee Salad and a Guava Foam Dressing   Main:Coriander Roasted Arctic Char Cilantro Yogurt Sauce with Roasted Fennel and Carrots   Dessert: Churros & Dulce de Leche Ice cream   Personally I like my choice better. The taste was more subtle and was quite refreshing for summer days.   Now from Tuesday to Thursday Bloom has a prix menu for $35 so you don't need to wait for any \"Licious\" try out their Mediterranean Menu with Latin American Influences!!"}
{"text":"Small restaurant with a nice contemporary touch. On Friday we ordered the lunch summerlicius menu. We ordered ensalana amozana/ceviche de pulpo. Main courses were picanha a la braa/ Casa limeña. Desert consisted of turron de mamey/ chocolate cake.   The best part of the meal were the appetizers. The main courses were not very flavourful and the desert was just ok. The service was somewhat slow as it seems they need more wait staff.   There is paid parking on the street nearby.   Glad I went but won't be going back."}
