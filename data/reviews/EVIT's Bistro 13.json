{"text":"Stopped here for lunch. Ordered the special fried shrimp with a side of mac and cheese. First off the fried shrimp had way too much of some kind of bread crumb batter and was burnt. The macaroni and cheese had chicken in it and I found 3 chunks of Gristle and a bit too much cayenne pepper for my taste. I think the food might have been a little better if the chef slash teacher would have been in the kitchen rather than out in the lobby talking about how great he is. I'm sorry to say that this food was so bad I was compelled to actually right a review. Wish I would have stopped at Pete's Fish and Chips instead."}
{"text":"This restaurant is run by EVIT students who are training to enter the Culinary/Baking & Pastry Arts industries and is managed by an Awesome Chef. The food is delicious and very reasonably priced. Everyone at Bistro 13 does a fantastic job, you can tell that the students are excited to be there serving food to the public."}
{"text":"Bistro 13 is a hidden gem. My wife and I had lunch there for the first time today. I had the Sonoran Chicken sandwich and my wife had the Caprese Chicken sandwich. They come with choice of sides and we picked the salad. Great pick. The salads were of fresh designer greens (no iceberg!) and the pesto ranch we asked for was very tasty. The presentation of both sandwiches was first class and the taste, positively delightful. My wife couldn't finish hers, there was so much, so I got to sample hers. I said this is something I would expect to be served in one of the upscale bistros in Scottsdale for VERY MUCH more. Bistro 13 IS a learning experience for students of the art, (YMMV) and they close promptly at 1:30 but my take is you owe it to yourself to try them."}
{"text":"EVIT Bistro 13 sits on the south side of Main Street in west Mesa and is easily passed by; but you should look for it and stop in for a bite to eat.  Situated in front of a Standard Restaurant Supply store and, appropriately, next to the East Valley Institute of Technology, is a great breakfast and lunch eatery run by culinary students under the tutelage of a chef/instructor.

Like most other \"school/retail\" establishments such as massage schools, beauty schools, hair institutes and the like, two things are prominent here: a great price and value for a product, and a high likelihood of receiving a quality product and service.  However, because this is a school run by learning students, there is the chance that one or both of these things will be amiss; but that tends to not be the norm here.

Inside there is a travel theme clearly conceived and decorated by students.  There are mosaics, paintings and even metal wall art that no doubt has been crafted by EVIT students that fit nicely into a student run/themed restaurant.  The colors inside are appealing and attractive, refreshing even.  There is also a nice outdoor seating area to enjoy your meal al fresco.  

From the outside, it is obvious that Bistro 13 is a former fast food building.  This allows for ample parking and the presence of a drive-thru.  If you are in a hurry or want an order to go, just call ahead and pick up your meal from the drive-thru.  

Because each order is cooked fresh, service can be a bit slow, but you are rewarded with a hot, fresh and tasty meal.  I was told that everything is made fresh, on premises, including such things as dressings, sauces and dips, waffle cut fries and even desserts.  In addition, there are daily specials that seem to fit the overall theme of \"Global Cuisine,\" so look forward to additional surprises not seen on the regular menu.  

One drawback of freshly prepared food cooked to order is that wait times for your meal can go into the 10+ minute range for something like the tasty Panko Chicken Fingers or a Sonoran Chicken Sandwich even when moderately busy.  However, the food is generally worth the wait.  This is also why you will want to call ahead before using the drive-thru.

When dining inside, you order and pay at the counter, then the food is delivered to you by one of the students or instructors.  There is real flatware wrapped in napkins and real glassware used for the beverages - so kudos to EVIT for not going the \"disposable\" route.  

So what about the food?  Besides being hot and fresh, the flavors are distinct, not over the top, and proportionally thought through.  There is a nice level of spice, when appropriate, and seasoning is consistently spot-on.  The sauces and dressings are tasty and distinct enough from each other to please almost any palette.  The fries are seasoned nicely, and are only enhanced by NOT HEINZ ketchup - but a proper International Red Sauce that usually is called catsup.  (Read my other reviews and you will know my affinity for catsup that is not the rotten tasting, overly-sweet, lacking real tomato flavor, Heinz variety that is way too prevalent in restaurants today - please, more places offer any other brand besides Heinz, you are doing your food a dis-service by using Heinz).  But, I digress. 

Other notable touches are homemade pickle spears that are crispy crunchy and distinctly seasoned and the ability to substitute bread on a sandwich with two grilled Portobello mushrooms for a low-carb option.

Overall, I am impressed with the food choices offered at Bistro 13.  Given the reasonably priced menu items, I know most diners will be happy they stopped here.  Just know that the hours are limited to two and a half hours for breakfast and three hours for lunch after being closed for an hour in between, so get to breakfast by 9:30am or lunch by 1:30pm and if you go at 10:00am or 2:00pm, you are out of luck; so plan ahead.  And yes, they take credit cards.

{"text":"This restaurant is a great place to eat.  It is a converted fast food building.  They are students so the service is a little slow but once your food arrives it is fabulous.  My husband and I ate there for less than $15.00.  We had lunch and an ice tea.  I had the Cobb salad which was delicious and my husband had a caprese sandwich with a salad.  I had to ask for a togo box because it was so big.  It is in a deserted part of Mesa.  Great food, Great prices, Great service. They have it all."}
{"text":"Amazing little Bistro that is student operated under the supervision of a chef instructor.  Great food and great prices!  My personal favorite on the menu is the  Southwest Chipotle Salad! Love it!  Bistro 13 is only open Monday thru Thursday, 7:00 - 9:30 Breakfast and 10:30 - 1:30 Lunch....Summer Hours."}
{"text":"This place isn't anything special, besides being affordable. The southwest salad was just plain with a spicy sauce which was okay. However the menu is really limited. On top of that, the service was terrible with food and drinks being mixed up and forgotten completely. I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful for fresh made to order lunches cooked by East Valley Institute of technology students. I love the panko chicken fingers and the Sonoran chicken sandwich. The students are really friendly, and the prices are extremely reasonable. It looks like in an abandoned fast food joint from the outside, don't let this stop you from going!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 salads to go. The Mediterranean Salad $4.50 with grilled chicken (add $2.00) and the Southwest Chipotle Ranch Salad $4.50 with grilled chicken (add $2.00).  They were both fantastic!  I like that they offer them as vegetarian with the option to add the chicken.  Many times I don't want the chicken on my salad and most places do not offer that option so it is nice that it is offered.

The salad and ingredients were super fresh and the dressings were amazing (home made)!  I also liked that they package the dressing separate from the salad so that it isn't wilted by the time I sit down to eat it.  I don't know if they serve it that way when you eat in or not but I do prefer to dress my own salad.  

The hours are limited here to Mon-Thur 7am to 9:30am and reopen at 10:30am to 1:30pm as this is a student run restaurant. Starting Aug. 1st it will be open the same hours but they will be adding Friday.
I will definitely be back to try out some of the other salads offered as well as other menu items.  I would recommend that you give it a try!"}
