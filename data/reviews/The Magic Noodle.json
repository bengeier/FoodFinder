{"text":"Let me start by saying that the food is GREAT! Which is what those stars are for. The service however, was absolutely not. My brother and I were greeted and seated upon arrival and the experience just depleted from there. The older lady that was our waitress seemed to be servicing the entire restaurant which I know can be stressful, so I didn't expect much. But she literally paid no attention to us AT ALL.. she walked by our table on several occasions with not even a \"how is your food?\" or \"do you need anything\". We asked for napkins and she threw them on the table. Our water glasses sat empty and unattended, while we watched her walk by our table and happily refill the glasses of the other guests. Luckily, one of the other younger girls working noticed we were being ignored and attended to us. I honestly feel that we were discriminated against racially, since we were 2 of the very few \"non Asian\" people dining.  Nonetheless, our experience was very disappointing and we will be getting take-out moving forward."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a must! Food is absolutely delicious & flavorful. First time here & tried about four different dishes including the spicy dumplings & Mongolian beef chow main. Good size food  portions are big enough to share. I'll definitely Be going back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Hand made noodles were great in the Mongolian Beef Chow Mein.  Hot and cold appetizers are also very good-try the Chinese Beef Burrito!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My family and I finally get to try this place as we live around the corner. We were there during lunch time and the place was packed. We had to wait a little but it was worth it as they prepared the noodles fresh. I would definitely recommend their pork pancakes. We also had the beef brisket noodle, Lan Zhou noodles and Mongolian Chow Mein. Everything was delicious and the service was great. Can't wait to go back next time to try other items."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place to eat some noodles. You can eat in or take out. Sometimes the soup can be a bit salty to some, but for the most part I think it is perfect. They usually aren't to busy with no wait. All of their noodles and soup are homemade and taste wonderful."}
{"text":"We arrived and everything was very clean and new. We ordered red braised beef noodle soup, house chow mein, and their gyoza/potstickers. I originally wanted the vegetable chow mein and asked our waiter if that was good and his response was, \"if that's what you like.\" And then I said well you work here.. have you tried the noodles?? Did you like them? What would you recommend? So that's how we ended up choosing the house chow mein.   The beef noodle soup came out and we were eating. It was very salty and not as rich as beef noodle soup is supposed to be.   The chow mein came out and it was good. It was tasty.. But salty also. The house chow mein comes with shrimp, pork, chicken, and beef. The whole works. I wonder if the vegetable one would have came out the exact same except with vegetables and if the waiter only suggested the house one over the vegetable one bc he liked how it came with a lot of meat.. as most guys would enjoy that kind of dish. I on the other hand do love my veggies.   The gyoza/potstickers came out and I really liked them! I liked them so much I ordered another. But at the same time I also wondered if I liked them so much bc I was hungry hahahahah and didn't really eat much of the 2 salty noodle dishes.   The bill came and I was disappointed and surprised at how much the gyoza/potstickers were!... $7.50 for 6 pieces.. the 6 pieces were in actuality only 3 since they cut it in half.  Imagine an egg roll.. cut diagonally. The chow mein was $8.99.   Safe to say at least I tried it."}
{"text":"Found a new must visit restaurant in Vegas.  We were up the street getting a massage and were in the mood for noodles so we found this place and we were in for a treat.  The soup had the perfect amount of spice savory flavors.  I can't wait to come back and explore the menu."}
{"text":"Very friendly host, food is definitely better than Noodle man on Rainbow.  I can feel they really put their heart into making food for you."}
{"text":"Love the spicy dumplings. The sliced pork with Galic sauce are good. Also order fish flat noodle with pickled vegetables and Dan Dan noodle. Yum yum yum. Another favorite noodle place found."}
{"text":"Very impressed....I got food to go and was pleasantly pleased. The service was friendly, fast and courtesy. You can watch the cooks hand-pull the noodles in the kitchen...it was interesting to watch. I've never had these type of homemade noodles before but 'wow' very delicious. You can really taste the difference.....they are soft, flavorful and tasty! I really enjoyed the house special pancakes (they are like long, round dumplings, really good!) The wonton Soup broth was a little fishy but the wontons were yummy. The beef brisket noodle soup was excellent....broth was perfect, beef was tender and noodles were out of this world!  Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere to begin with. Got the chicken chowmein which was how i wanted on a chowmein.. very tasty and not dry. Order was somewhat good for two. The sweet and sour cucumber was good too . Also ordered chong qing style spicy noodle, very unique taste , something to try.. but the best of all is the noodle.. so fresh!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The Sichuan Beef Noodle Bowl was the best. The noodles are perfect texture. The spicy wontons were great as well. Like butter the wrappers are so soft and tender. Great service as well. I would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I don't normally leave reviews for places on Yelp, but I was thoroughly satisfied with not only the service here but the outstanding food. I highly recommend the Beef Brisket Noodles. The food came out fast, and it was hot -which was awesome. Overall, this place is a new fave of mine."}
{"text":"Really cute and clean inside. I had the sweet/sour cucumbers , Chinese burrito and chicken fried rice. Everything was delish. Large portions , good value for your money. Service was quick and professional.  Loved watching the noodles being made!"}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time we have come here! The food is amazing and noodles are made by hand! We drive from Arizona just to eat here!"}
{"text":"We ordered the spicy wonton for appetizers. Those little things were delicious! The spice was just right! Very flavorful!  I ordered the fish noodle with pickled vegetables and the hubby got the beef brisket noodles.  Everything was good and fresh. The service was good except for the time it took to get my husbands soup. It took more than 20 minutes to get it. I think there was some miscommunication in the kitchen. Overall the soup was good. I would give them a try. Maybe if I order something else I would like it more than the soup and I'll update this review."}
{"text":"Tried the Mongolian beef chow mein as it was recommended by the waitress. It was amazing. Love the decoration too. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So far so good, fast service.. i will review again when I come back to taste some more Of their entrees.."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Noodles are amazingly good. I watched them make the noodles from scratch. Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Super fresh noodle ?the noodle here as the name suggests ?and made in the house ?you can see them twirl the noodle in the kitchen and before you know it ?it's in your bowl ?we order fish noodle ?szechuan beef brisket noodle ?mongolian beef chow mein ?chinese beef burrito ?spicy beef shank with beef tenderlion ?the food  it taste different delicious ?service was prompt ?the fist time try to post up the yelp ?don't know why it does 't  post out ? this time i take picture post up again ?couse The Magic Noodle deserve b a 5 star"}
{"text":"First time here try the noodles all I can said this is the best noodles in town , this place will be my noodles place in the future."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on a recent Friday, to pick up some lunch for myself and my friend while she was at work.   Magic Noodle is located in the same plaza as Infused Tea Lounge, Makai, etc, just south of Tropicana on Fort Apache. I had arrived less than 30 minutes after they opened but almost the entire restaurant was full already. Every table was occupied, if not mildly over occupied. The layout of the restaurant is fairly similar to that of Shang's Artisan or Noodle man, with an open kitchen blocked off by a large glass wall showing the noodle being pulled.   I had ordered a dan dan noodle for myself, shredded chicken noodle w/ garlic sauce for her, and a beef brisket noodle for another friend at the office. It took maybe 15-20 minutes to get my order but it was still fairly quick, considering how busy the restaurant was.   The food smelled really good in the car as I was being mildly tortured while driving over to the office my friend is at.   They separate all the sauces and soups since it was ordered as take out. For some reason, the dan dan noodle sauce got all over the place, leaving like less than an inch of sauce left in that huge take out bowl. Fortunately, that was still enough to cover all the noodles, if anything, it was still a bit salty. Sauce had a good amount of numbing spice/oil to it which was pretty decent  The noodles, even after sitting in a take out box for give or take 30 minutes, were still quite al dente and had a good amount of bite to it, which was great. I noticed their strands of noodles are not too uniform throughout. Thickness varied quite a lot in the same order.   Great to have a hand pulled noodle place so close to home. Beats driving to Noodle Man or Shang's Artisan when feeling a bit lazy. Parking is much easier here than Shang's !"}
{"text":"First time trying this place and it was SO good! Very nice servers and quick service. You are able to sit at the bar and watch them make the noodles which is cool entertainment. I had the Mongolian beef chow mein which was so flavorful and spicy. Had leftovers for such a good price too. Def coming back!"}
{"text":"Everything I tasted was delicious, went about 7pm will definitely be back. Magical indeed!!"}
{"text":"I love noodles. Especially fresh, hand pulled noodles. This place did not disappoint- the noodles were chewy, and the broth was tasty. They could have added veggies but I think I was too busy gulping down yummy noodles to notice."}
{"text":"Wow, really good Chinese food. Love the atmosphere too and the prices. Service was excellent. So happy these guys opened up near my house. Best chow main I have ever had in Vegas for sure."}
{"text":"First time here and both the hubby and I enjoyed everything! We ordered the chicken mushroom noodle soup, special chow mein, special fried rice and the spicy dumplings. The food was delicious, fresh and served to order. We will be back! Laid back atmosphere and modern decorating. Good service and watching the handpulled noodles being made was really cool. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We Love every single thing we ever ordered here!  Fresh noodles and very yummy dishes/soups!  Even our picky toddler loves their noodles.  We will definitely come back here.  Thanks very much, The Magic Noodle!"}
{"text":"Really great place for some Szechuan flavor. A lot of options of different noodles and an open kitchen so you can see them make it. Prices are also reasonable."}
{"text":"I must say that we has the best dinner ever!  Service was great they were helpful and friendly. We sat   bar and got to watch the noodlers noodle.  We had C4 and C7 which were both fantastic and spicy. The noodles were perfect and taste of both were distinctly different. We will be back again- soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight small place but great food .Watched them making noodles staff very friendly will be going back next week and probably the week after and the week after!!!! Can't wait to try something different.It may take a bit but it is fresh once you taste it you won't mind the weight next time."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! absolute YUM-NESS! good, fast, friendly service as soon as we walked in we were seated (which im not used to) im from california so im used to walking into a restaurant and getting ignored for 15 minutes having to ask for service...i had their spicy beef noodle soup with the thickest noodles beef was tender as hell! soup was the perfect spice level & salt level. i am also inlove with with spicy wontons!!! i could go swimming in an ocean of their spicy wontons seriously!!!!"}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. Everything.  The noodle wars in Vegas are in full swing and Magic Noodle is a clear winner in my book, and of just because it's within walking distance to my castle.  The noodles have the right bite, the broth has the the right richness, and the meat is plentiful, fatty and like pure, hot, sex. Yeah...I went there.  I'm referring to the \"Szechuan Beef Noodles\". Get the regular hand pulled.  Hungover? Well...let me just say that this brought me back to life after St. Patrick's Day. I had died. I think. So there's that, too.  The spicy wontons are great too, just add some extra chili oil that is at your table. Unless you're a wuss."}
{"text":"This place was my favorite noodle place for awhile.  I can visit the place 2-3 times a week.  It is possibly the most authentic Chinese noodle place in Vegas.  This place remind me of the street vendors when I was in China more than 20 years ago.   I am writing this to let the management know that I am not going back for minimum of 12 months.  Because the food is so good, I can over look the poor services and horrible sanitation.  Until  one day, my 6 year old son and I was completely ignored in the place for 20 minutes.  Our order was taken for awhile and the customers came after us were taking care of.  When my son told me the 3rd time \"Dad, I am hungry.\"  This is enough."}
{"text":"Noodles are really fresh & great texture! Parents and husband love it! Their beef pancake rolls and pot stickers are so good too!"}
{"text":"I don't know if I believe in magic, but I do believe in knife-shaved noodles! Much like Shaang and Noodle Man, Magic Noodle offers a similar menu of housemade noodle dishes, rices, and apps, served in a wood-accented dining room where the focal point is a glassed-in kitchen where the staff are stretching and pulling the noodles to order. The guys here have been especially great about putting on a show for the camera, so whip out your phone and get it on the 'gram.  I always have to order spicy wontons if I see them on a menu, and the version here were generously portioned and very thinly-skinned, with a great house-made chili oil sauce. The Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup is a huge portion of \"spicy\" (not really) broth with chunks of beef brisket, broccoli, and plenty of noodles- specify knife-shaved for the chewy, curly style I like best.  Looking forward to revisiting for the pancakes and burrito apps next time!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and boy they do not disappoint. I am a noodle fanatic and this is by far the best Chinese noodle restaurant ever. Their noodles are freshly hand pull, unlike some other places that used store bought noodles. I highly recommend their hand pull noodles or the knife cut, you can definitely taste the difference as it has more texture compare to regular noodles. I can't wait to be back and try other items. Highly recommend if you love noodles like me."}
{"text":"Ordered the beef brisket soup noodles. Broth was pretty good, I added some soy sauce and chili oil to bump it up a little bit. I didn't love it, but the price was great, staff was attentive and kind. Will be seeking better flavor elsewhere."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  We are definitely coming back whenever we are back in Vegas.  We can't stop talking about it."}
{"text":"First time here with my son, very happy to see other noodle shop opened around my house. Came here around 8pm on the Saturday and it was packed. The wait isn't bad. Food came really quick. Beef Brisket Noodle, Sliced Pork with Garlic Sauce, Beef Tripe w/ Spicy Sauce are all of my favorites. It's just like what we had in Sichuan. Will be here again for sure. Good to have another place for take out."}
{"text":"Noodle soup was ok. Kung Pao was not good at all, was sweet . Service was quite friendly and waiting time was short."}
{"text":"I shop in the area often and noticed a new place to eat. I ordered the Mongolian Noodle dish and the House Rice.  Both were great!  It's hard to find a good Chinese restaurant, luckily I found one. The staff was great and helpful. I plan on doing pick up when I don't have time to cook."}
{"text":"Noodles are legit, whenever I get a jones for hand-pulled noodles this place is the jam. Seems a little pricey, but in line with how other niche places charge in Vegas. Worth the extra few bucks. I like that you can see the kitchen and what everyone is doing, it's all transparent. It's always busy and you can tell these guys are all about getting it done and getting the food out."}
{"text":"Excellent! Great restaurant, just love this place! Noodles are handmade and the meal is very tasty."}
{"text":"IFast and attentive, friendly service. Filled up on a weekend lunch pretty quick, you know it must be that good.   The chili wontons ARE a definite must. The wontons have the perfect texture, not soggy at all and you can taste the meatiness of the filling without the heat overpowering the dish. Would order two of these next time. Don't let the chili in the name stop you from getting them!  Also ordered the szechuan beef brisket noodle soup and the reviews weren't kidding, the beef is super tender!! Plus there were plenty of it. We had it with the original noodles and I'm not too particular about noodles but the bf said the soup doesn't really hold onto the noodles well but it's a soupy soup you know. Cooked al dente. Broth was also light and not too oily which was surprising. No msg here!  And last, we had the combination chow mein. Again the sauce doesn't stick well on the noodles but the flavor was all there. Simple but satisfying, would like it to be a tad bit more saucy but that's my preference. Lots of veggies and meat (shrimp, beef, chicken, spam?). Good enough for two people too.   Definitely coming back again, especially for those wontons!!"}
{"text":"A Chinese Noodle Restaurant on the Westside--yay!   I went here with a friend of mine and we ordered their Chinese Spicy Dumplings which for my opinion was really good and tasty.  We've ordered their Beef Brisket Noodle and their Lan Zhou Noodle. You can taste the freshness of their noodles and the broth I was expecting it to be more thicker for the Brisket because that's what I'm used to---over all my cravings has been satisfied and it was really good.  You will be able to see through how they make their noodles which is fascinating and entertaining at the same time."}
{"text":"I've seen some guy hand making noodles a restaurant on the strip, but I didn't expect to find something similar so far off the strip.  I guess this place is magical.  The handmade noodles have a nice bite to them.  The tomato egg noodle soup wasn't what I quite expected, but the fried egg on it was really good.  Wontons in spicy oil are great as everyone else stated along with their special pancakes.  And those Dan Dan noodles will numb your mouth into that.  This is a great find off the strip."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this place! We used to go to Noodle Man but their service as been pissing me off so we are looking for new options. My sister recommended this place and I really liked it. First off kudos to the server working there, he was very honest about the menu and made honest recommendations and did not just say yes to what I asked for when he knows it would not be a good choice, I appreciate the honesty! I ordered the first noodle and asked for knife cut noodle and the server said that is not a good choice because the broth works better with the regular noodle so of course I went with his recommendation!  We both got the first noodle on the menu (forgot what it's called), and it was so good. Noodle was fresh and chewy, broth was simple but so flavorful with a little chili providing a nice kick. The only thing that threw me off was the meat, it had that \"fridge\" smell that was a little strong. It was not inedible or anything but ruined the noodle a bit.   I cannot wait to come back and try more."}
{"text":"????Las Vegas????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"First time here and I will be back for sure! My dad and I decided to come here for lunch after I had my tires changed at Walmart (across the street). It was a cold and windy day so this place definitely hit the spot.  House special pancakes (pork): this was sooo good. The dough was thin and had a nice crunch to it. The pork inside was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Highly recommend.   Lan Zhou noodle: my dad got this dish. He's a picky eater and even he admitted that the broth and noodles were tasty. He didn't get it spicy but you do have the option to make it spicy.   Fish noodle with pickled vegetables: if you love pickled veggies, then you'll love this dish. The broth was delicious and had a nice tang to it that wasn't overwhelming from the pickled veggies.   If there was one thing I could recommend, it would be to add more meat into these dishes. I think mine only came with 5 pieces of fish and my dad's came with 3 or 4 slices of beef. I do want to try the other stuff on their menu so I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Overall this place was pretty good, service was quick and to the point. In terms of the food it was pretty good and in big portions. I tried both the Mongolian beef chow mein and the beef brisket noodles (not pictured). I'd definitely recommend the Mongolian beef chow mein but for the beef brisket noodles I would be wary if you prefer a moderately savory/salty broth as this one was pretty salty. Both dishes were served with flat wide noodles which had an extremely nice texture and chew. I wouldn't exactly deem this restaurant as a 5/5 as I felt it lacked any redeeming, special qualities setting it apart from any other noodle restaurant. But I still recommend it to anyone who loves good handmade noodles!"}
{"text":"So yummy and the service from Jennifer is awesome! She is very welcoming and serves you right away with your drink. The beef brisket noodle soup is to die for - huge bowl filled with tasty broth, lots of fresh hand-made noodles and the most tender beef you can imagine. It's cool to watch them make the hand pulled noodles from scratch right in front of you! I can't wait to go back and try the rest of their menu items. Thank you for opening as you are now my favorite go to place for beef noodle soup!"}
{"text":"This has become my favorite noodle house after tonight. Good service, tasty food and great price. What more can one ask for? The dish that is marked as spicy really isn't too spicy, but you need to eat slowly due to quite a bit grease in the soup. The amount of noodle they put in your bowl is more than enough. You won't walk away hungry."}
{"text":"I'll keep it plain and simple..I prefer Shang Artisan over this place for hand pooled noodles in Vegas! Not a bad meal but the flavors didn't compare to Shang ?"}
{"text":"So I've seen a ton of photos, and heard great things about this place. The location is really nice, and clean. When you walk in straight ahead there is a glass with a bar in front of it, and the chefs are seen pulling the noodles. I personally really like noodles. I went with the spicy wontons to start off, and then got the Szechuan beef brisket with knife cut noodles. The taste was GREAT! I usually add more spice to my food, but this had just the right amount of spice. The noodles were just right. I will definitely be returning to try more stuff."}
{"text":"Fresh hand pulled noodles!!! I would have to say very similar to another restaurant on Rainbow, but Magic Noodle I am a fan of. I have been here twice for takeout. My favorites include -Zhajiang Noodles: sauce noodle, very refreshing and great taste. -Sweet and Sour Cucumber -Sweet and Sour Black Fungus salad -House Special Veggie Pancakes: best appetizer, a must try, it has a good texture when you bite into it, comes with dipping sauce. My friend commented that thier food is authentic and very similar to how it would be prepared in China. Prices are reasonable and you will get full....leftovers still taste good. I want to try a noodle soup the next time I visit."}
{"text":"So first time going here. It was a Friday night and when we walked in there were no tables. We had to add our name to a list to be seated. So that was a sign that this place was good.  We were seated probably in about a 20 minute time frame and we had a party of 3 so it was pretty reasonable and it was about 8:30 at night. We had a front row seat to the noodle making as well and our 7 year old loved that. The waiter was on top of everything and thanks to yelp we saved a lot of time and already knew what we wanted.   I got the brisket noodle bowl soup , daughter got chicken fried rice and husband got he Mongolian beef chow mein  I was kind of disappointed in the brisket because it was sooooo fatty, like extremely fatty very large chunks. All white pieces . And that's my only complaint. So for that bowl being all the rave that was the only let down. Noodles and broth were amazing. Chicken fried rice was absolutely amazing. The Mongolian beef chow mein was great and perfect amount of spice .  The service was very fast and the mason jar waters are a great touch. Will definitely be returning here again and can't wait to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner on a windy Saturday night.  First impression when walking in, \"this place is clean, inviting and well lit.  And I'm really hungry right now\".   Took a while to decided what to get but the waitress was very patient and helpful.   One complaint, there are no descriptions of the menu items.   I like to know what I'm ordering.  Usually I do, but I still have not a clue was Dan Dan noodles are.  And tap water had a normal great taste to it.  They might want to make sure that water filter is working.  Oh well,,,   Ended up with the Mongolian beef item.  It was really super tasty.  Noodles were obviously fresh and flavors were great.  Veggies cooked nicely.  Came with peppers, onion and carrot I believe.  Portion is solid.  Cost $8.95.   Not too shabby.  Wife got Szechwan Beef Brisket.  I didn't like it but she did.      Would I go back, yes.  Fresh food, reasonable prices and nice flavor.    I like the window looking into the kitchen and the guy swinging the noodles around all fancy like."}
{"text":"Great noodles and flavor.  Knife cut all the way.  Came with family and everyone loved their respective meals"}
{"text":"The food were very authentic , and the food portion is very generous! We ordered 5 dishes and none of the dish disappointed me! Definitely recommend to everyone"}
{"text":"So finally got around to checking out The Magic Noodle. I was in carb recovery kind of mood post long bike day. I had noodles on my mind and thought of the perfect spot that been on my radar. So first impression was really like the interior with the original artwork one of the walls, the open kitchen look always favorite, and ample seating from counter area to tables. Truthfully it set up like lot of Ramen or Noodle shops around the valley or the ones I have been to. The menu is nothing crazy only two pages but has most of your favorites soup base noodles, sauce noodles, stir-fried and fried rice plus appetizers. The key or trending is the noodles  fresh made or really not keeping up with the times. Lol. It was lot of decisions only because it was my first time. I ended up settling for the Mongolian Beef Chow Mein and since first time had get appetizer went with the Onion Pancake.   The Onion Pancake asked my server if should go with the add egg. He told me is very popular but wanted try the pancake without no distractions. It was pretty awesome. The texture is little bit like pancake. It not as fluffy or looks like pancake. I more like pita bread kind of. It filling like bread, see the onions, not over powering but definitely can taste the green onion, and nice starter or like getting basket of bread. Maybe if add the egg game changer?? I enjoyed it and would recommend it as starter.  The Mongolian Beef Chow Mein was awesome. The portion size is generous and not doubt get your money worth in food. I love! Hearty this dish was with ample amounts of noodles. The vegetables and the beef felt like every bite got the best of all worlds. It had nice depth of flavor in the sauce. Solid noodle dish.   The service was five stars!!!!! The gentlemen was awesome since it was my first time. Never had empty glass of water. Checked several times make sure everything was good. Friendly.   The Magic Noodle player in the noodle game for me. I love the fact close to home for me. No doubt plan on coming back cause barely tapped the menu. Till my next noodle recovery meal. lol!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. We had the Szechwan Beef Brisket noodle bowl, my grandmother with original noodles and I with knife cut noodle. It was made fresh while we waited and got to watch as our noodles were being pulled. The service was great and the waiter was super friendly, helping us to decide what to have as this was our first time. I'm definitely coming here again and recommending to everyone I know."}
{"text":"This was an outstanding lunch! Our first time and we will most definitely be back! The spicy wontons were so good as an appetizer that we finished our meal with a second order of them. Clean restaurant, excellent service, friendly help with the menu and you get to watch master noodle makers toss dough and cook. This is the spot!"}
{"text":"A3 and A4 are very good appetizers my girlfriend had bad experience with wontons but when she tried A4 she liked it so much. Overall it's a must go to place!! Nothing like this in California."}
{"text":"Last time I went there got bad service and waitress ignoring me. After 30 days I try give them last chance If still give me same Attitude I will never go there again.  But today When I get there, The waiter smile to me and very nice and fast assigned me a seat .  Ask me need any drink and give me menu. Service is excellent.  When we finished , He came over ask us anything need to go .  He is absolutely excellent service and nice person. I ask his , He told me his name is \"Bill\".  So next time when I visit Magic noodle If Bill service I will stay . If she show up , I will turn my head over and leave.  (Magic noodle ) the food it's really as their name magic super delicious."}
{"text":"In need of some hot delish Chinese soup, this us the place. I tried the first item on the menu, a bit spicy but it was indicated. Still the thin slices of beef, the homemade noodles sets your tummy right. My son in from a visit from Austin, he knows good Asian food, ordered the brisket noodle, good food in a big bowl! I'm going again very soon introduce to my group of friends!"}
{"text":"Ok so besides the fact that the food is really good, i have a funny story that will never let me forget this place:  The guy told me, \"Everything on the table is yours.\" I paid, grabbed my 3 bags, and left. I got to my car and checked my order...  1 bag: broth  1 bag: noodles/beef  1 bag:   The third bag was the roll of carry out bags! I brought it back in, and we both had a laugh. Luckily, the food is delicious because I'd love to go back and steal his bags again......i meeean dine here again!"}
{"text":"Loved the pancakes and fried rice as well as the spicy brisket noodles. It had an authentic taste to it that I really liked."}
{"text":"Amazing meal and great presentation. Ordered beef noodle soup, chicken fried rice, pancakes and Dan Dan noodles. Noodles were all hand pulled. The family was fascinated with the chef that did the noodle pulling. Truly an artful. Most of all, food were super delicious. Would like to have more noodles in the noodle soup next time. Perfect meal."}
{"text":"I tried Magic Noodle three times ordering 6 different dishes. Every dish I ordered was really sparse on the meat. The noodles were better than ok I would rate them a solid B but the meat was the cheapest meat possible and very little of it."}
{"text":"Chinese burrito, sechwan beef and fish noodles are very delicious. Sometimes a little wait but worth it."}
{"text":"I rarely give places 5 stars on first tries but this place is bomb! I had just arrived to vegas that and after a long nap it was lunch time, I yelped for noodles and found this place near by where my friend lives... It is authentic chinese noodles and for those who know me... i'm a snob on chinese food and noodles!   This place has hand made noodles and you can have them cut in whatever way you like....   Green onion pancakes (4/5): thin and crispy. went well with the chili oil sauce. It wasn't burnt which is a plus!  C4 Szechuan brisket beef w/ knife cut noodles (4/5): broth wasn't as spicy so i added more chili oil but they put lots of beef briskets.   C1 Lan zhou w/knife cut (3/5): not spicy broth more of a pork base and flavor was ok.   Service is good, even though the place is small... the workers are hustling... They do speak chinese but I spoke in english when I ordered."}
{"text":"Freshly hand pulled noodles in an inviting, cozy atmosphere. The service was awesome too. Go here ASAP. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love noodles? I bet almost everybody does, especially homemade noodles. We arrived pass the lunch time but this place was still full house, that's good, it means this place is really that good.   For appetizer we ordered the spicy wonton. I ordered the Chong Qing spicy noodles and my husband ordered the Lan Zhou noodles.   The spicy wonton was very very good. We love the sauce, it wasn't plain of chili oil, this sauce had a very good flavor. The wonton itself were delicious.   My noodles was so dang delicious. The broth looked red but It wasn't that spicy at all. I chose the thick cut flat noodles. The noodles were so perfect, cooked perfect, wasn't too soft that can make it mushy. The broth was rich flavorful, it contained with peanuts, ground pork, shredded Chinese cabbage and bok Choy.   My husband's soup was also delicious. He chose the usual cut type of noodles. The noodles came with slices of beef and the broth was the best broth! It was so rich of beef broth flavor.  Because this noodle soup was so good, my husband ate it all! No leftover!   The restaurant isn't that big, so I am pretty sure at lunch time, it will be packed. The price is not bad at all, and so worth it. And the service is fast and efficient. Inside the restaurant, you'll be able to watch the men making the noodles through the glass window. I'll be back in the future if we're back to Vegas."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. The noodles were great and the soup was astounding. It was at a reasonable price.  We had some good service as well. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing fresh! Fun staff! Fun to watch them make your noodles and YUMMY food! A must try"}
{"text":"Before we could even get seated we were asked to move seats because some lady didn't like the fact that I'm Black my boyfriend is white and we were there with our extremely well behaved 9 yr old. The restaurant was empty except for us and the table of horrible women and the waitress attempted to sit us right behind them until one of the women said something to her. The waitress who seemed very nice let us know the woman was talking badly about us but instead of saying something to her she asked us to move. I thought about it for a second and let them know we wouldn't be ordering. I'm appalled at the way we were treated and how it was handled. I was very excited to try this place out since we eat out a lot and love some of the other noodle houses in town but we won't be back."}
{"text":"A friend recently introduced me to Magic Noodle and after that first visit I was compelled to tell other friends about it and to start making return trips for lunch.  My recommendations after several visits include:  Appetizers:  I highly recommend the House Special Pancakes or the Spicy Wonton.  Or just get both.  You'll thank me later.  Soups:  I can definitely recommend the two I've tried so far:  Lan Zhou Noodle, and Chong Qing Style Spicy Noodle.  I need to be disciplined and try others as well, but both of these are so good, it's hard to force myself to give something else a try.  Even so, absolutely everything I've seen brought out looks tempting.  Now read on; you'll have some choices to make when you order:  Types of noodles.  All the noodles are hand made right there in the restaurant.  In fact, the magic happens right behind a glass wall separating diners from the kitchen, and it's pretty cool to watch as the noodles are being stretched/pulled by hand.  If you have kids, bring them--they'll be as fascinated as you are to watch.  When you order, you'll have the choice between original noodles, flat noodles, or knife cut.  They're all good, but give the knife cut noodles a try.  Rather than being uniform in shape, they're literally cut by hand and you'll end up with a variety of sizes and shapes in your broth.  The waiters will always be happy to recommend a noodle type deepening on the broth you're going to enjoy.    Types of broth.  Speaking of broth, ask the waiter to explain the varieties.  There are six or seven different broths available based on the various soups you chose.  You may want to focus on the broth when you order rather than just what's floating in it.  The staff is awesome!  They'll obviously talk to you about the menu, but one of the best things about everyone I've spoken with there is they seem genuinely excited about the restaurant.  Parking:  The Magic Noodle is in a storefront, and there's always sufficient parking available.  So many delicious choices and at a very reasonable price!  If you enjoy noodles and haven't tried Magic Noodles, treat yourself and add a Chinese noodle house to your noodle house options!"}
{"text":"Noodles were so fresh and good. Kid loved watching them make the noodles. Too bad they didn't have pan fried dumplings. The burrito dumplings were good but not the same. All the noodles were good"}
{"text":"Great addition to the Southwest! The house pancakes with pork and the beef brisket noodle soup were both fantastic. Neither of us liked the Mongolian chow mein- way too sweet. We ordered with the knife cut noodles with the chow mein and those were awesome- really great texture. Will definitely be back to try those in another dish!"}
{"text":"As a fellow fresh noodle lover... we can definitely appreciate a good hand pull noodle!  Noodle Master Andy isn't afraid to show up his tricks up his sleeves and we can definitely taste the difference!  We tried the Spicy brisket with hand pulled noodles and also the pickled fish with shaved noodles.  Both have good flavors but more importantly great texture in the noodles!  They're also conveniently located by lots of anchors like Walmart and Lowe's so you can easily take a break from errands and grab yourself a bowl of noodles!"}
{"text":"This restaurant reminded me of The Noodle Man(same design, fresh noodle ) I tried the Sichuan spicy  beef brisket 3/5 with hand cut noodle (way too thick) it wasn't spicy or much flavor as I expected..But the brisket was very tender though(wish there was more meat) hey I love my meats.. hehe  What surprised me was the Mongolian beef noodle 5/5.. it was soo good Sweet n Spicy.  To me stir fried noodle w veggies n beef are the same everywhere BUT not here, probably one of the best stir fried noodle EVER !!  OMG soo  Delicious     I will definitely come back here to try other dishes."}
{"text":"So this place is good, real good. You get to watch the guy make the noodles which is a lot of fun. The food itself is great, the noodles are sooooooo good and the prices are very reasonable. It's a sit down restaurant, but nothing too fancy. Downside, the service was so slow. I went on a Tuesday at 6 pm. All the tables were full and it took 45 minutes to get our food which was a bowl of soup and chow main. The poor table next to us waited for over an hour for their food. It took their server 30 minutes to bring them their hot tea. I needed leftover containers and got sick of waiting, so I went and grabbed them myself along with the check, and left cash at the table all without our server even knowing. Keep in mind the  dining area is small.  Yep, it was that bad. I am going to chalk it up to them being a new restaurant and still working out the kinks. I'll be back in a month or two."}
{"text":"Ah... just discovered this place. Tried C7 with the wide noodles. Wow! Spicy, delicious and the noodles are amazing. Can't wait to try the other dishes!! Beware though... can be messy"}
{"text":"So good!  Amazing noodles, great value and a kitchen that's really fun to watch as they prepare your meal and stretch the noodles.  I didn't get a chance to try the spicy dumplings or pancakes but that's a go-to the next time I head over there.  The noodles I got (beef brisket) were flavorful, fresh and delicious.  The portions are great and the value is fine too.  My wife had the special chow mein which was also great from what I tried and we both left full and happy.  We'll be back around for sure in the future."}
{"text":"I was not expecting Magic Noodles to be this good! My husband had the green bean and pork belly noodles and I had the black bean noodles, they were so fresh and every bite was delicious! I highly recommend this place. A great way to watch the cook pull the noodles in the kitchen! It's great for kids to watch!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service, and nice neighborhood restaurant.  Cozy, but staff was good at turning tables to keep wait to a reasonable length.  Every we ordered was very good, and menu had a nice range and variety.  Perhaps not top of the range for all items, but everything was very solid, and variety of menu options was good.  Enjoyed the beef roll, green onion pancake with braised pork belly, dan dan noodles and szechuan beef noodle soup, with knife cut noodles.  Definitely will return."}
{"text":"We tried the Lan Zhou noodle and the Fish Noodle w/ Pickled Veg last night, and I highly recommend trying the fish noodle. The broth was absolutely amazing- perfect combination of hot and sour and had huge slices of fish.   We chose two types of noodles and I'm a bigger fan of the knife cut noodles (thick and chewy!) than the flat wide hand pulled noodles (got soggy after a few min in the broth).   Also recommend trying the sliced pork with garlic sauce- tender pork and lots of minced garlic. Just wish it was spicier! The house special pancakes were just oversized gyoza. Nothing too special. The beef filling was flavorful and juicy though.  Food came out really slow, so it was nice to be able to watch the noodle making from the dining area. Service was ok. Good location in the SW, fair prices, good portions- 4 stars"}
{"text":"There noodle is very good and soup base are really tasty. Very good customer service. If you choose to eat noodles this is the best place to go in town. Definitely deserved a five-star restaurant"}
{"text":"Five is excessive, but they're so nearby, so filling, and so tasty that I gotta give it up.   When I see the words \"Spicy beef noodle soup\" c4 and  fresh hand pulled noodles\", I get more excited than I should, and fear I will never burn off the calories to justify my noodle habit.   One caveat: I think the soup, at least the spicy one, goes better with the hand pulled noodles than the knife shaved. I enjoy a doughy noodle every now and then but it's almost like they soak up too much spice.   If for some reason, you come to magic noodle, and don't want noodles. The house fried rice and appetizers are bomb too...detour  Literally (not literally but almost literally) everything tastes better with the chili oil from the spicy Wontons. I know it's just(?) chili oil but maybe it's the flavor the wontons leave behind that make it taste better than straight up chili oil. I like to use it for as many different non soup items as I can. End detour  Seeing the word burrito gave me pause but the burritos and pancakes (A3 was my choice) at this Chinese restaurant are quite good. The sweet and sour cucumber, B5 are a refreshing treat as well. I could easily imagine coming here splitting a bowl of noodles (I haven't tried it yet so I don't know if there's an associated fee) and splitting two or three appetizers the cucumbers might be necessary if only to make me feel less guilty about all the carbs (bonus that they taste good)."}
{"text":"My husband and I discovered this lovely Chinese restaurant, Magic noodles. The name says it all, they make the noddles from scratch. It is a show combined with a delightful experience.  The staff is friendly and the fish soup noddles were extremely delicious.  We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese noodle!  We went around 630 on a Thursday night, the place was busy but no line.  They only had two servers working, and one was helping out with a to go order, so the service was a little slow, but I can't blame them the server was working hard and fast running around every where.  The restaurant itself is not very big though, clean and nice decor. There is also a see through mirror to the kitchen and you can watch the chef pulling noodles right in front of you! So if they pick their nose or spit in your food you would see it right away, and of course that wasn't happening here :)  I love the noodle soup I got (lan zhou beef noodle soup), soup was perfectly seasoned. The noodles were chewy and had great taste!  I also got the spicy wonton as an appetizer, and that was wayyyyy too much food. I was very hungry too before dinner, I still could not finish all the noodles and soup. The portion size is not bad at all. Even if you don't get appetizer you will walk away more than satiated.  Price is decent as well compared to other noodle places, around $8-10 a bowl. Other places charged up to $12-18.."}
{"text":"Heard many time from my friends about this restaurant. Very good noodles !! They make fresh noodle on site! I have ordered the house special chow mein and Szechuan beef brisket noodle, it's the best in town. They are surely busy and packed. They might not have the best service but the food is surely the best haha. Thank you guys! Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"?????Vegas???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"It was my 2nd time today. Love the fresh noodles.  Tried the beef brisket and the chicken mushroom noodles so far and loved them both. We also ordered the fried rice and the son loved it"}
{"text":"Food was delicious ! We ordered the wonton soup. The Broth was amazing! And the dumplings so good . My baby loved them. Also order the beef Mongolian noodles . They were so fresh and left perfectly cooked . Order the appetizer not the pancake the ones that look like eggs rolls . The customer service was excellent . Owner was really nice and you can tell he works hard!"}
{"text":"Was here on my lunch break and it was super busy. Luckily, I ordered ahead of time. I ordered the spicy wontons and the Lan Zhou noodles. The spicy wonton has the perfect between sweet, salty, and spicy. Super delicious. The portion was just right. The Lan Zhou noodles was really good also. The noodles were perfectly cooked, not too hard, not too soft. The noodles had just enough springiness to it (all noodles are made in house). Would recommend the soup for anyone that wants a soup that is not too overpowering with seasoning or too plain. Definitely does the soul good on a cold night."}
{"text":"We don't live on this side of town and are now bummed that we don't after finding this place! Man what a gem! Best noodles I've ever had. The house special pancakes with pork are out of this world! We will definitely be making a trip out this way when we want noodles!"}
{"text":"Wow what a great place I go every Tuesday  So go another  day It is fun to watch them  Make tour noodles fresh"}
{"text":"I've been addicted to this place lately, and I can't stop coming back! They sure know how to work their magic. The hand-pulled noodles are sooooo good, and the texture is just perfect, not too chewy nor too soft. If you prefer chewier, you can opt for the knife-shaved or the flat, wide noodles. You can also watch them make your magical noodles fresh behind the glass in their open kitchen.  My favorite items include:  -Szechuan beef noodle  -spicy pork ribs noodle -Dan Dan noodle -Mongolian beef chow mein  -House special fried rice -spicy wonton -homemade style cucumber -sweet and sour black fungus salad (yes that says fungus) -Chinese beef burrito   -steamed chicken with chili sauce    The food and service are amazing, and the prices are very reasonable. Heck, you even get a show out of it. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy noodles made in house. Although this place is super busy, the staff does great to accommodate the demand. I usually order the Mongolian beef dish, wish is delicious. Just be prepared to wait a few minutes during busy hours."}
{"text":"Want to have some noodle soup and my granddaughter and I try this place I love it the noodles are so good and love the broth they served with noodles go check them out you will love it"}
{"text":"This place has legit noodles. It's pretty cool watching them make them by hand.  Very simple and nice decor, mellow place.  Started off with the onion pancake. The beef brisket soup is a must try. The broth is full of flavor and not a lot of oil. Tried the Mongolian noodles,  and wow.  Do yourself a favor and try it. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I had to give this place 5 stars! So my wife decided she wanted to come here and we came to have dinner. We sat down, Eric was our waiter and took our orders right away.... I ordered the House Special  Chow Mein with no ONIONS. As I started to eat it, it was very fresh and noodles were amazing I bit into an onion and immediately Eric came over and I was kind of embarrassed to to eat the meal he went ahead and changed it and I ended up having a Beef Brisket Soup. Well.... it was AMAZING! The noodles were incredible that I think I'm going back my next day off to eat the same thing again. All I can say is the food is very fresh and the service is 5 stars"}
{"text":"Prior to magic noodle my only experience with hand pulled noodles were little hole in the walls in New York. This spot does not disappoint.   As soon as you enter you are greeted and quickly shown to your table. From the table you are able to peer into the kitchen and see how the noodles are made.   The food was amazing. We started with the scallion pancakes & Braised Pork Belly. Pancakes were brought out quickly and the pork belly were cooked to perfection. Following the appetizers was my Szechuan Beef Brisket Noodle. The only thing that did not meet my expectations were the spice levels (nothing that the complimentary chilli oil couldn't fix)  Overall I loved everything in my meal and will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu"}
{"text":"Been to this place multiple times since it opened (we have a shop a few doors down). I'm never disappointed- everything is flavorful and the service is always great!! They don't mind altering orders and my personal favorite is mongolian beef chow mein."}
{"text":"Hand cut, fresh noodles.  Pulling and forming the noodle right in front of your eyes.  Options such as soup, chow mein, or meat/noodle combos.  Most options are more Chengdu-based so expect that peppercorn spice.  Takeout available and prices are under $10 for dishes and filling.  Really tasty and an other great addition to the booming fresh noodle scene in Vegas.  Nice that Magic Noodle is on the west side so I don't have to drive down to China Town for a noodle fix."}
{"text":"First, this place is tiny and being new and we're still in the middle of a colder weather, be prepare to wait during popular dinner time. My friend and I went here for dinner around 6:30 on a Friday. We got lucky and only had to wait for 5 minutes. There's no waiting area though as space is really tight and fully utilized, so we had to awkwardly stand by the entrance door while waiting. Located in the same plaza as thai noodle house and infused tea. Plenty of parking.  We tried their spicy wontons for appetizers and they're really good. The wonton skin was soft, while the filling was firm, giving you a nice texture. I could taste the shrimp and pork in the fillings too, so they didn't have much fillers. The chili sauce had a good flavor and went well with the wontons. It's quite pricey though. $6.50 for only 6 wontons.   For noodle soup, I had their Szechuan beef brisket noodle ($8.95). I chose to have their regular hand-pulled noodle. The noodles were cooked perfectly al-dente. However, the broth was not spicy at all. I was expecting that numbing spiciness that comes from Szechuan dishes, but nope, tasted just a regular beef broth with some chili oil. The brisket was tender for the most part and they gave a lot of it too. I do like that their broth is not too salty.   Service was ok. Had to ask for water refill a couple times. The place is clean, but you will still smell like beef soup after. Just like after you have pho lol. I would come back again and try their other soups."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon, overall it was okay. There was only one waiter servicing all the tables from what I could see. From the moment we sat down at the bar facing the kitchen all I could focus on was the \"B\" health grade on the wall. The kitchen from what I could see wasn't the cleanest, but despite my nervousness we stayed. Being Vegan, I ordered the vegetable chow mein. Once I received my food I soon realized that the plastic chopsticks make it difficult to eat noodles with because the noodles slide on the chopstick. The waiter didn't check on us at all throughout the interaction and the food was just okay. Tbh I enjoy the chow mein at Panda Express more. Not worth the hype, and the mediocre service."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our first experience very much! My favorites were the veggie pancake, pickled cabbage and Mongolian beef chow mein. It is fun to watch the noodles being made. Great service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Service was pretty good. The staff was smiling and I came late joining my bf. She got me water without me asking.   I got the knife cut noodles C7. It was ok. The noodles were nice n chewy. I liked the texture. The flavor was def that numbing spiciness you expect but not super spicy to me.   My bf got the dan dan noodles. I didn't get to try the noodles but I tried the sauce. It was spicy and also numbing. I don't remember dan dan noodles being made that way but it was good. I liked his bowl more.   I think this place is alright for a noodle shop but I feel like it's not as spicy as I would've expected. Not bad though."}
{"text":"So fresh tasting. This place is a little gem. Service is so warm and friendly too. This is has easily become a new favorite spot!!"}
{"text":"\"Vegas cold-weather season\" hit suddenly so the family and I tried this new local shop to warm up. So excited to have a noodle shop similar to Shang but closer to home!  We tried the beef brisket with knife cut noodle and the fish with pickled vegetable and knife cut noodles.  Beef brisket: broth is ginger flavor forward, slightly floral and sweet. Overall good, but could have more depth of that beefy flavor. The knife cut noodles were fabulous, perfectly not-too-thin-not-too-thick. Meat was tasty, as well. Very filling on this cold night.  Fish & Pickled Veg Noodle: This one packs a good spicy kick. Loved, loved the spice level! Especially with the pickled vegetables cutting through the spiced broth. It's only missing some fresh thinly sliced cabbage or other fresh vegetable to add some texture. I noticed with the noodles, some were very thick and others more similar to the size of the noodles in the beef brisket bowl so their cook was inconsistent. Fish was tasty with all the broth flavor, but a little muddy on the finish.  The shop is small and steadily busy, yet tables were rotating at a good pace with no one left waiting too long to find their spot. Service was also good. For beverages, the hot spicy soup would be great washed down with a nice beer, so hopefully they'll add beer and wine to the menu eventually (soft drinks/teas/juices currently.)  Overall, solid dishes - more like 3.5 stars- and will be returning to try more."}
{"text":"And i'm definitely not coming back here to eat again. I was disappointed. The broth was plain. There was nothing about my dish that made me dance as I ate. The noodles were good. Wasn't the greatest. I finished my food, only because I was starving. But at the end of it, I felt horrible for eating something I didn't enjoy... and paid for. Our service was fantastic though. He was kind and informative about their menu."}
{"text":"A great place for a bowl of noodles.  One of only a few places in LV that has authentic hand pulled noodles.  Service was prompt and the food was good.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"My new favorite noodle place! Ive been here once before and was impressed that I had to have my mom try it out too. I had the Szechuan beef brisket noodle and my mother had the chow mein, and both were delicious. Everything here is definitely flavorful! & the service was great! This place is worth the try!"}
{"text":"This past Monday, I was hoping to Hawaiian food.  Fortunately, they were closed on Memorial day so I ended up a few doors down at the Magic Noodle.    First impressions walking in, it's a nice setup.  Because I was alone, I opted to sit at the bar, especially because I could see the kitchen hand making the noodles.  Lunch and show.  On this visit, I opted for chicken and mushroom.  Once it came out and letting it sit a few minutes to cool down, the first thing I did was to taste the soup.  The soup was bland.  I then made the slow attempt to taste the mushroom and it was fantastic, as well as the chicken.  Eat the noodle, soup, chicken and mushroom certainly tasted great. And just to be sure, tasting the soup when it was the only thing left had very little taste.  Good service, ok broth, great noodles, chicken and soup, clean restaurant and nice atmosphere.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Love the noodles here...had the Mongolian, the garlic chicken, and the pork and string bean and all three were great...I get the cravings for this place cuz the taste makes u want to come back"}
{"text":"Delicious food .. love the service and the food .. this is gonna be my new spot whenever I feeling hungry ..."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!! We came here for my birthday per a recommendation and it did not disappoint!! Hand pulled noodles, tender brisket and very flavorful broth! We were told we had to try the beef pancakes and I am so glad we did!! Black Fungus salad was incredible as well, it looks strange but worth trying!! Prices here were also great!!!"}
{"text":"After Earl's hockey practice, he wanted noodles so we yelped and found the Magic Noodle.  We were seated immediately and after some perusing, we settled for 1. Green Onion Pancakes with pork belly - compared to the soup noodle, this one was the winner.   2. Chong Qing Style Spicy Noodle - I liked the pickled vegetable (green beans) in this soup, but it was lacking in flavor.  I also wish they had included on the menu that this has crushed peanuts.  I prefer the spicy noodle at La Mian way more.   3. Spicy Pork Ribs Noodle - this one tasted better than Chong Qing, but still bleh.  Service was great!  Our kind waiter even gave my toddler apple juice when she asked for it.  But..I don't know if I will return because I do like La Mian better."}
{"text":"I love this place. The fresh wide noodle are delicious. I can't wait to go back. I try and bring everyone here for some great tasting food."}
{"text":"The most authentic Chinese noodle I've ever had in US. Seriously the beef hand-pulled noodle and the red chili sauce are exactly taste like what I had in China."}
{"text":"My experience with the main star, the noodles was an okay kind of thing. The Dan Dan was not what I was expecting, the seasoning in the Dan Dan made my throat numb and I ended up having my taste buds not taste any of the other foods I had ordered! I have to say the noodles are fresh and is pretty good. I would definitely recommend the knife cut noodles for those would like fresh made noodles with a bit of a chewy texture to it. The soup had an okay flavor, just a bit of more spice would make it better! Overall, I found the flavor of the broths ok, the noodles were definitely fresh, and one of the side dishes I had ordered, the spicy wonton, I think it was called, was definitely delicious!"}
{"text":"Environment: An average-sized restaurant, with a hall that leads to restrooms in the back, and the kitchen off to the side with clear panels so that you can see the chefs preparing your food (especially the noodles).   Service: When you first enter, there is a sign-in sheet where you can indicate how many are in your party. However, both times a waiter had quickly greeted my friends and I to inquire himself how many people were in our party, and the wait times were not very long.  Food: I have tried the chicken with mushroom soup, as well as the beef brisket soup, spicy wontons, and house pancake appetizer. First, the house pancake, and spicy wonton appetizers. My boyfriend and I ordered the house pancakes with pork inside, and they were amazing. The filling was similar to that of pork dumplings/gyoza, but what really sold them for me was the outer bread encasing. It was light, crispy, and tasted like pastry dough. A must try! And although I do not mix well with spicy foods, the wontons were not overly spicy, just more on the chili-oil side. They were soft to eat, and the wonton wrapper actually reminded me of the noodles used for Pad Kee Mao.   For both soups, I ordered the original noodles. You can also order knife cut or flat-wide noodles. The original noodles had a good texture to them-- not too thin or too thick, and had a good amount of chewiness. There were a variety of mushrooms in the chicken with mushroom soup, which I really enjoyed. The chicken was not over-seasoned, but still very moist. For the beef brisket soup, the meat was very soft, but made the meal misleading as the brisket came in big chunks, so it seemed like there wasn't enough protein at first glance. However, the broth for both soups was very light, which allowed for the noodles, meats, and other garnishes in the soups to take the spotlight.   Overall: The prices were cheap, the food was really good, and I will definitely be back the next time I am in the Vegas area. Definitely would recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Yummy! I love this newer Chinese Restaurant and have been here now countless times, mostly take out. My favorites apps are their spicy wontons, beef pancakes, and the Spicy Beef Shank cold dish.   My favorite dishes are the Lan Zhou, Szechuan Beef, and Tomato and Egg Noodle. Sometimes the broth is super flavorful some days and others it's more bland. That would be my only real complaint.   The service here has always been too notch and I never have to wait long for a takeout order. I love it too because it's in a super convenient location."}
{"text":"Best tasting noodles in the Spring Valley/Summerlin area.  I've enjoyed most in the area, but none close to this place.  It has become my new #1 go-to-option for noodles."}
{"text":"My friend actually recommended this place. I had the Song Sao noodles today and it was amazing. The noodles texture were great and price was very reasonable too. Our server was very sweet and attentive. I have found my new favorite noodle place."}
{"text":"Wow. This is the best noodle restaurant so far. Definitely they will have me as a repeat customer. Even my sisters and their spouses love it too."}
{"text":"Food: Noodle is made very well, the texture is nice and soft yet has a hint of chewiness to it.  Soup base is good, it has a lot of flavor. The good part is how clear it is, no cloudiness which means it was cooked repeatedly.  Service: I like the service here. They acknowledge you once you walk in. I usually go off hours so I never catch the rush hours, which works to my benefit. The servers are always coming around to check for empty dishes and to refill our drinks.  Environment: We enjoy looking into the kitchen area, where we see the noodles being made. The sitting area is nice and clean. That tables are not sticky like most Asian restaurants."}
{"text":"Good food. Price is ok.    Wait time os to long.  And i wish their portions were a bit bigger"}
{"text":"For Vegas, easily 5 stars! Hand-pulled Chinese noodles, great portions, and the staff is very knowledgeable about the ingredients and will work with you on food allergies. The dumplings, the noodle dishes, the service, everything - no complaints."}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite noodle restaurant! I have tried the pancakes, spicy wontons, the C7, and the C4. All of which are amazing. The service is also really good."}
{"text":"This place was hopping during the dinner hour.  Greeted and seated quickly.  We both wanted some noodles with sauce. We decided on chicken w/garlic sauce and Kung pao chicken over noodles.  Two glasses of water came right after our order.  The food came shortly after that.  Nice flavor and ample sauce to coat the noodles.  Good amount of noodles on the plate .  Both dishes were tasty.  Reasonable prices.  Lots of parking available."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Let me start off with the service is spot on even when they are busy and overwhelmed. The food is spot on. I have been here a couple times and the food and service have been the same, amazing. Definitely one of my go to spots."}
{"text":"Service: 5 stars hands down!!  Food: Equally amazing!  -House Special Pancake is the best app here IMO!! We got the beef and it amazes me with the taste and texture. Def a must order!! -Spicy wonton wasn't bad but once we ate the pancake, nothing really came close to being as amazing.  -We ordered 3 beef brisket soups, each with different noodles. I loved my knife cut noodles! I don't think I'd deviate from those either. -Mongolian beef noodle had a spicy flavor, rich with sauce. It has a kick and can leave your lips kinda numb but the flavor was worth it, and I don't do spicy.  -Chicken fried rice? Yassssss!  We were really taken back by how chill they were with us. We had my 3 year old niece with us and they even joked around with her. It made my heart happy! They goofed around with us and told some jokes about green onions. LOL. It was great!  Fresh, hand cut noodles are WHATS UP!!!"}
{"text":"Wow and wow. Picked up several dishes for takeout.  The restaurant owner(?) told us the food would not be as good as if we ate it in house. Well, I can't wait to try it in house. The food was amazing. You just can't match the taste of the homemade noodles. And, the house fried rice was amazing, too."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from here and got two orders of the Szechuan Beef Brisket Noodles. The beef was seasoned well and very tender, the you can taste the freshness of the noodles, and the broth was very flavorful and delicious. The staff was also prompt and courteous. Overall, highly recommend this place and we will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Well it's no secret I love a good handmade noodle! Abra-cadabra- Magic noodle did not disappoint.   Their noodles were a bit varied in size/shape. Call them imperfect...or maybe say it's a true sign they are handmade. Regardless, the texture was fresh and delightful.   I found their broth to be superior to other handmade noodle shops. The chicken and mushrooms was outstanding. We also got the brisket. The brisket was far too fatty for my liking but the few meaty pieces were tender and delicious. The broth on this was pho-esque. The dan dan noodles were very spicy. Too spicy to be able to eat an entire bowl. A few bites would suffice.   It's cute inside. We got to watch them make noodles during our visit. Service was acceptable. They don't have any diet soda, only regular.  That's weird.   A definite winner for a steaming bowl of delicious Asian noodles. I'll be back for more magic noodles!"}
{"text":"I love knife cut noodles so had to come here to experiment. The noodles weren't chewy like how I expected it to taste.  Bc I'm so used to eating knife cut noodles, I know what is good vs bad and these were on the bad side of the spectrum. Also the spicy dumplings weren't that great either! I'm normally not this big of a good snob but when it comes to Sichuan, I know what's good.  I would need to go back to try the other noodles, but would not recommend the thick knife cut noodles. I liked the restaurant in itself because they ha e glass walls - you have a clear viewing of the kitchen. Service was great and the restaurant was sanitary."}
{"text":"Super delicious, super fresh, super friendly   It just has to be good when you walk in and you are the only non-Chinese in the restaurant.  It's exciting to watch the cooks hand pull the noodles.  All the dishes our family had were tasty with the noodles being the highlight.  The staff interacts like family with the customers and they encourage you to go watch your food being prepared in the open (behind glass) kitchen. We definitely will be back and we will highly recommend Magic Noodle to all our friends and family"}
{"text":"I'd love to rate with 5 stars but my dan dan was salty. I'll come back again, hoping the saltiness can be adjusted."}
{"text":"Noodle Man, Shang's, move over. There's a new player in town and it's better.   I got the beef brisket noodle soup with shaved noodles. I couldn't be happier with my decision. The shaved noodles are perfect to my preference. Great chewiness, not too long, not too short. The broth was delicious but I've had better. The beef was so tender and just melted in my mouth. Hands down, there isn't a beef brisket noodle soup in Vegas that can compare.  My wife got the black fungus and the chicken and mushroom soup with the wide noodles. The broth was pretty good, there were a ton of mushrooms and the chicken wasn't dry as I was half expecting, especially for white meat. The wide noodles had great texture but they were extremely long and it just felt like the noodle was too overwhelming for the dish and took away from the flavor. I would personally prefer a thinner noodle that would be able to absorb more flavor and broth. The black fungus was awesome. The last time I had it was probably in my childhood when my parents ordered it somewhere. Definitely something I wouldn't have ordered on my own. It had great crunch and texture with a nice sweet and sour flavor. My wife loved it, we would probably order it again.   I looked over and saw that someone had ordered the pork belly and string beans noodle stir fry. It looked so on point! My wife hates fatty meat and even she was eyeing that dish. That and/or the Mongolian chow mein is on the to try list for our next visit. And there WILL be a next visit. Probably tomorrow. It was that good. I'm excited to try some more apps."}
{"text":"Stopped by The Magic Noodle at the recommendation of a Bougie BFF.   This is as good as it gets...  Magic Noodle Service:  We came in with a party of 12 which included a baby and a 2 year old and our timing was good, we were seated immediately.  We sampled a lot of appetizers and ordered individual dishes as well.  Appetizers came out quickly and our main dishes came our shortly after.  Great work by the staff and kitchen.  Magic Noodle Cuisine:  My main dish was the C4/Szechuan Beef Brisket Noodle and it was very tasty.  The broth was spicy enough to make me sweat but didn't burn the mouth, love it.  The fresh noodles made in house is evident.  The Spicy Won Tons were so spicy and delish, we had to get another set in and I'm definitely ordering on the next visit.  The Onion Pancakes with the braised pork belly is another one I'm ordering again, full of flavor.  I sampled the House, Chicken and Mongolian Beef Chow Mein, all were good-tasting.  Magic Noodle Ambiance: The kitchen ahs glass windows which showcases the chefs tossing the lovely in house noodles.  The kitchen is surrounded by bar seating and the dining area is aligned with wooden tables and seats.  The wall is adorned with Chinese drawings and Hanzi in black and white to make for a very clean look.  Every noodle I sampled with our big party of 12 had the same characteristic, you can taste the freshness and it will bring you back.  The $ pricing for $$$ quality food will also bring you back.  The overall Szechuan cuisine at The Magic Noodle is very tasty and I enjoyed my first visit.  See you at the next one...enjoy! =)"}
{"text":"These hand-pulled noodles are the real deal! I came out with my family of very picky food snobs and surprisingly, no complaints! Stunning reviews all around, we each ordered different noodles and each had its own amazing and unique flavor (I ordered the chicken mushroom one). The noodles are hand pulled in front of you and are made to order, but even if you couldn't see it directly in front of you, you can definitely tell from the texture of the noodles, they have the perfect chew! The broth was flavorful and you have the option of adjusting the spice level if necessary (perfect for me!). Amazing food and FANTASTIC service! 10/10 recommend  :)"}
{"text":"I had spicy pork rib noodle here and it was the best noodle I have ever tasted! Soup was very authentic and perfect. Noodle was made by hand fresh and very delicious. I will come back again and again for their noodles!"}
{"text":"I was in town for a national pug meet up for the weekend and this was nearby the hotel. Located in a strip mal where there is plenty of parking.   The noodles are made in house which is common in the San Gabriel Valley of So Cal. It was lunch time and I ordered the spicy beef noodle soup and pork belly & green onion pancakes. The pancakes were a smaller portion that I normally get - but the flavor and texture was spot on. The beef noodle soup was also hearty, tasty and just as good as the places I frequent in So Ca. I chatted with the owner who was younger and friendly just like my server.  Credit cards are accepted here. I would definitely recommend Magic Noodle if you're in the area and craving fresh hand pulled noodles."}
{"text":"We get the c3 and add the amazing oil spice they give you with it. Wide noodles and omg the taste is just amazing!!!! I crave it every day!!! Yummmmmaaaaaaayyyyy"}
{"text":"So tasty! Homemade noodles  great soup! Get it spicy. Also they're really nice and accommodating. I recommend the spicy chow mein and the spicy noodle soup."}
{"text":"This was is really delicious. I love that you can get different type of noodles for your soup. The staff is really nice and helpful in choosing when you're unsure of what to get.   I'll definitely be back or maybe just order some to go one night!"}
{"text":"HOLY FmotherUfCrazyKoo I usually get Thai food... spicy drunken noodle, or pad Thai..  This place is close and opened a few month ago, great reviews so I figured give it a shot.  Called in my order... I wanted the king pow chicken and chicken chow mein. Told the guy to pick me the most ordered or loved appetizer.. he suggested the spicy beef wonton.  Picked up my order, the restaurant was close to full... with happy faces. Bounced back home with my food opened up the wontons. WOWWWWWWWW. I don't eat this type of food very often.... I love these. Good thing my lady doesn't eat red meat or pork...is pork red meat? The spicy beef wontons blew me away. I ate them all in less than 3 minutes. Added the spicy oil stuff after the first one I ate. Straight firrrrre  Now, I move onto the kung pow... don't know how to compare it... cause I don't usually eat this. But it's GREAT. I add the hot oil to bot the Kung pow and chow mein....  All I have to say is try it. DEFINITELY GET THE SPICY BEEF WONTON!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this new noodle place, there's so many popping up in town. I was a bit disappointed. I ordered the Lang zhou noodle, the noodles were pretty good, a little on the salty side but good flavor. I started with the veggie pancake, that I enjoyed, that was probably the best part of dinner. I ordered a hot tea and was very disappointing, it's supposed to be hot!  It was barely warm, not enjoyable at all. The service was also not very good, not very friendly, a bit slow and not welcoming at all. The chicken in the chicken chow mein my father ordered were tiny slivers of chicken and were chewy, I don't recommended. It's a small restaurant, which is fine, no alcohol available.  It would also be nice if the menu had a description of what the noodle dishes contained. I had to google the names to figure out what was in them."}
{"text":"Yes! So many yessss! I am a pescatarian but eat mostly veg. I order the noodle soup with veggie broth and veggies and am in heaven.   Watching the noodle makers twist and turn dough into perfect noodles is just an added bonus."}
{"text":"Best place ever !! Sense moving to Vegas this has been my number one noodle shop of choice !! They have the best hand pulled noodles I've ever had !!  And their beef fried rice is literally the best I've ever had !! Even better then my moms ! And that's hard to beat !!!  The workers their are super friendly and happy to explain any of the items on their menu!"}
{"text":"Noodles were amazing, rice was amazing, service was okay, who cares the food made up for any shortcomings."}
{"text":"Interesting noodle place. They make their noodles by hand from scratch. Tasty brisket soup. Fair price and big portions. Definitely a must try. Different from the usual ramen and pho."}
{"text":"Wow! I loved this place. Thanks to Yelp I discovered this place and I was supper exited to go. The Magic Noodle did not disappoint a single bit. I love the open kitchen and the view of the making on noodles by hand. I had the  Beef Brisket Soup and cannot wait to try the Szechuan one next time. This is the kind of place that is worth the 45min drive and it caters to true foodies. Awesome!"}
{"text":"My favorite  noodle place in the neighborhood.  Quick service, friendly staff and amazing hand pulled noodles. I try not to eat much here because of my new low carb diet but it's hard to resist the Temptation of their fresh noodles and delicious spices.  Definitely highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for noodles in town!   The restaurant is clean and modern with a traditional touch. I love the open display of the kitchen as you can watch your noodles being made fresh after each order. I've been here five times now, and the quality and consistency of the noodles have been on point every single time.   Here are my recommendations: For appetizers, get the sweet and sour cucumber, spicy wonton, and the Chinese beef burrito. Pro tip: Dip the Chinese beef burrito into the spicy wonton sauce. You're welcome.   All the noodles I've tried have been really good including the spicy beef noodle soup, Dan Dan noodles, and Mongolian chow mein. There are three different styles of noodles: hand-pulled (skinny), knife-shaved, and thick or wide noodles. The knife shaved and thick noodles have a chewier texture than the hand-pulled.   The amazing food and the great service has me coming back and back again."}
{"text":"Chinese food on Christmas Eve is a tradition. But we've 86'd all the usual takeout places we used to patronize closer to home, after appearances on KTNV's Dirty Dining in one case, and a change of chef in another, made them no-go. So I went to Yelp and found The Magic Noodle. Despite the name, it didn't occur to me that this wasn't going to be the typical Chinese food place of our past, but oh, well, we go with the flow.   We brought along a bottle of wine, just in case they didn't serve it. Not only do they not, it was tolerated because it was Christmas Eve, but strongly discouraged other times. Good thing we thought to bring a corkscrew. And since I drink exactly two things - coffee and wine - the coffee mugs we were provided (to sort-of hide the contents) were perfectly okay with me.  Service was very friendly, and our waitress was patient with our questions. That was good, since there are virtually no explanations for menu items with Chinese names.  We started with a Szechuan dumpling appetizer, which was very tasty. I ordered Lan Zhou noodle soup, and my husband got the Szechuan beef brisket. But as soon as they were delivered, we switched dishes. He expected the brisket to be sliced, but these were chunks, and covered in fat. The Lan Zhou was sliced.  I thought I could handle the chunks of brisket, but it turned out to be so fatty that there was almost no meat to eat. I filled up a small plate completely with nothing but fat, and in the end there was virtually only soup and noodles. (The noodles were excellent and broth was good). The waitress brought me a small plate of the sliced Lan Zhou beef. I have no idea what kind of cut this is, but it was ice-cold, looked greenish in the center, and tasted weird to me.   The restaurant is clean and modern, the noodle-making show in the open kitchen is fascinating, the prices are reasonable, but to us it just wasn't worth the trip."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, ( I ordered beef noodle and beef pancakes)very good service. I like the energy of this place. One thing that I noticed while I was eating was the happiness in the face of the guys making the noodles inside the kitchen. Also the kitchen is impeccably clean and you can see everything from outside. The happy energy of the employees got me. They work hard to give you the best at that place. I'll definitely come back to try something else! I don't know another place where I can find fresh noodles like that. Congrats!"}
{"text":"After seeing countless mesmerizing photos on Unlokt and LasVegasFill's IG , I finally tried this place out. I ordered the following:  Appetizers: - Wontons in chili oil (not too spicy and the wontons skins were fresh and soft.  The meatball inside was flavorful and juicy) - House Special Pancakes (slightly crispy and the meat inside was juicy, but it made the pancake outside a little soggy. The vinegar that came with it was such a great dipping sauce.  I also used the chili oil from the wontons for this too)  Entree: - Szechuan Beef Brisket Noodle with the wide noodles (I personally like my pasta a little al dente and that's the texture of the wide noodles.  It's a little thicker, with slightly more chew.  The beef was tender and flavorful.  The soup base was sooo flavorful and not spicy.  Don't be deterred by the all the chili oil-- it's not bad at all)  Service: Their staff was welcoming and friendly.  Great service every time I visited and you can tell the server was really passionate about their food.  I don't know how you can ignore some of these noodle pics.  Try this place out!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed The Magic Noodle. The layout is perfect for watching the kitchen make your fresh noodles. The service was overly friendly and attentive. The food did not disappoint.  I ordered the beef brisket noodle soup with knife cut noodles. The noodles were probably the only minor negative for me. Being knife cut, they were naturally imperfect, going from thick and chewy on one end to super thin on the other. Next time, I'll try their hand-pulled noodles so I can get my slurp on. I thought the beef and the broth were flavorful with the meat being incredibly tender.  We also tried the sweet and sour black fungus salad. Definitely up there on my list of favorite types of fungus! I just love the texture."}
{"text":"Delicious noodles. If you like Shang Artisan Noodle, you'll like this place.   This place just opened up a few days ago, so they're still working out the kinks. Expect slow service to begin with."}
{"text":"Came here because of the reviews. It did not disappoint. There are only a few vegetarian options but the the food is great. Service is great as well. I just think itnis cool that there is a guys tossing noodles in the window."}
{"text":"Came by myself so only tried the fish and pickled vegetable noodle soup with the knife cut noodles. Authentic and yummy. Place is super clean and staff super nice and efficient. Service is quick and prices reasonable. 5 tables filled up right after I arrived at 11:05am. All Chinese so you know it's authentic. I will definitely be coming back with my family."}
{"text":"1. I love this location - especially since there is pretty decent parking and it is close to my home.  2. The food was delicious and very fresh.  3. Our waitress did not have the best English but thankfully, we speak Chinese and the owner or manager was also very helpful.   Our beef noodle soups came out fairly quickly and we also enjoyed some cold side dishes and spicy wontons. In addition, the stir fried pork belly and string bean noodles took a little longer to come out. I would have also liked the string beans to be cooked a little more, they seemed to be steamed and then stir fried in.   My family greatly enjoyed their noodle soups and the side dishes. I loved the spicy wontons and it's always great to see any place making fresh noodles in their restaurant. I give extra props since it is a difficult and tedious task to do.   The pricing is extremely reasonable and their menu reminds me of the Noodle Man and Shang's. However, I really did enjoy this restaurant and will definitely be back, especially since it is so close to home.   We went when it first opened and I'm positive it has gotten even better since we have been there. We look forwarded to going back in the future!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I've eaten here twice and both times the food exceeds my expectations.  You can't go wrong with any of the soups and since then cut their own noodles, you can ask for them to be extra long  I'll be back, for sure!"}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????11?????????"}
{"text":"It's about time they got a good noodle bar on this side of town! Always fresh hand pulled and knife cut noodles with great texture and flavor! Can't skip the onion pancakes here either, a lot less greasy than other ones in town. Must try!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews for this place we had to check it out and it didn't disappoint. Szechuan Beef noodle soup and the Spicy Dumplings were both killer dishes and I can't recommend them enough. Service was also very attentive and it's cool to be able to see the noodles being made from anywhere you sit."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this place out. I got beef brisket noodle soup with wide noodles. I recommend the wide noodles because they were yummy and chewy! They also show how they make the noodles in front of you, which is really cool. I think next time I will get it spicy though. It is a huge portion and I couldn't even finish it myself, but so worth it. It took a little bit of time to receive my food but they were nice enough give me a free soft drink. Definitely coming back and trying their other items!"}
{"text":"Good stuff! Really enjoyed the noodles! Guy makes noodles in front of windows which is great for kids."}
{"text":"I saw a pop up on Yelp a month ago, saved it and got the chance to try it out today.  The Magic Noodle reminds me a lot of The Noodle Man off Rainbow.  The Magic Noodle is a little bigger.  It's clean and has great customer service.   We ordered:  -Sliced Pork Garlic Sauce (If you love pork and garlic, this dish is a must!) -Spicy Beef Shank with Beef Tenderloin (Meaty, it wasn't bad.  We were hoping it was similar to another dish at Chef Hung in Irvine.  We miss their Spicy Beef Tendon.  This dish has the same taste, but different texture since we had beef tendon there.  Fresh and cold.) -C1  Lan Zhou Noodle (Clean broth, fresh noodles, I think I like the noodle texture at Noodle Man better.  But this is still very good.) -C3  Beef Brisket Noodle  (Husband had this noodle soup and he really liked it.)  We enjoyed the service and food here.  Only about 2 miles away from home.  Happy there is another noodle spot similar to The Noodle Man, since it's a pain to drive to off the Rainbow.  Also, in the summertime this place should be cooler than The Noodle Man.  This store doesn't get the afternoon sun."}
{"text":"So so good! Great little spot, nice vibe. Staff is friendly. Fun watching the noodles being made. Ingredients were fresh and flavors were amazing. Affordable. Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Best place EVER ! I've been eating here for the past couple of months and still amazed from the  flavors freshness and super great service ! So happy it's by my house :)"}
{"text":"My favorite place for noodles in Vegas, I come here a few times a week.   Their dough is fresh and handmade and the texture is chewy and doughy.  My favorite is the szechuan beef noodles. I recommend getting it with the knife cut noodles.  I only wish they put szechuan peppercorn in the soup!  Their dan dan míen is also pretty good if you like the mouth numbing peppercorn flavor."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place out since it was a new Chinese noodle place near my house. We placed our orders which were two noodle soup dishes and specifically requested the knife cut noodles option. We were waiting for a while and were wondering why everyone seated around us (and seated later than us) were getting their orders first.   Thirty minutes later, we were told by our server that they don't have fresh knife cut noodles and that their hand-pulled noodles were fresher. It would take an additional 5-10 minutes to make our order. Why didn't they tell us this information 30 minutes ago?   After waiting patiently and being almost borderline hangry, we finally received our orders. We ordered the Fish Noodle with Pickled Vegetables and the Beef Brisket Noodle which were both delicious. The former has a savory, spicy broth that complimented the fish and the latter, a nice succulent dark broth that was brightened by cilantro, green onions, and other veggies.   So long story made short, the food was definitely good and worth returning for but the staff need to communicate better with each other and their customers about their orders. The customer service was a 2, the food was a 5. Another recent review also mentioned waiting a long time for their order due to miscommunication in the kitchen. If this restaurant will stay successful, they'll have to improve this problem."}
{"text":"I drove over 35 minutes to try this place...and I was not disappointed. I had seen pictures of the awesome noodles of this place on instagram and I knew I had to try them.  The inside of the restaurant is fairly small and they can't really sit many people at the same time. That is why I think it is important to go early in order to be seated promptly. I went with a large group of people at 6:00pm and had no issues getting a table. By the time we left though there were at least 15 people waiting to be seated.   The food here is REALLY good. I ordered the beef brisket soup with wide noodles. The noodles were awesome and the soup was very flavorful. I was impressed with the amount of meat they put on the soup as well. They do not shy away from that!   I also ordered the pork garlic appetizer and I honestly think this was one of the best things! I had never had something like that before and it is on my list to order it again!  Prompt and great service received. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Needed something quick before work and this was on the way,  so I decided to drag my coworker and have lunch.  Luckily we missed the lunch rush, so we were greeted and sat quickly with very prompt water service.  We got the treat of seeing the noodle man handmaking the noodles, so definitely worth the wait since the times I've went to Noodle Man, there was no noodle maker!  With the help of our server, Benny, we picked out their house special Beef Brisket Noodle  (next visit will be with the knife cut noodle) and Mongolian Beef Chow Mein.  The broth of the beef brisket noodle had great depth and body to it. Noodles were al dente, with enough bite. And the seasoning all through out was amazing. For someone whose allergies are working on overtime and can still discern the taste of the dish, it makes me wonder how others can say their food is bland...   The Mongolian Beef Chow Mein had great spice and heat. Definitely made my nose run, but not horribly. Fifteen minutes in I'm surprised my allergies weren't kicking in to overdrive. With all the soy sauce that they use, most Asian restaurants I go to my sinuses are already going full force, but not here.   The highlight of the meal was when I kiddingly asked our waiter, \"As you can see, my friend is white, are you sure he can handle the spice levels?\" Without missing a beat, he said it's not the spicy but throughout the meal, he was very nice to ask to make sure it really wasn't spicy haha. Sorry Larry, love you friend!  Definitely coming back to try their other dishes. Move over Noodle Man.  Too bad they don't have a dessert menu :-3"}
{"text":"Saw this place open and walked by the establishment several times. Finally had the opportunity to dine there. The food is great. Everything on the menu looked delicious. The prices was lower than I expected. Get a free show out of it as well. The service was great. Servers are genuine and sincere which makes the whole dining experience much better. Will be going back again."}
{"text":"Came in on Friday afternoon. Very nice decor and atmosphere sit in restaurant. We order something on menu is kind new to us. Pork pancake and fish with sour pickle noodle. It taste different yet very delicious. Next time I will try the knife shave noodle. Will be back soon with next review"}
{"text":"The Brisket with knife cut noodle is a must. Lots of cilantro, so if you don't like that much, just ask for light on the cilantro. The onion pancake is a must try and the beef burrito, yum!"}
{"text":"I'm very fond of this style of Chinese cooking, and with this place being so close to where I live, decided to try it. It was also a rainy day, which is perfect for hot noodle soups. The food here is just ok. I had the \"beef burrito\" aka taiwanese beef roll, and the pork pancake to start. The pancakes are long and rectangular, not like the normal shape of this dish at most places. The beef roll was a small portion for $6.50 and was just mediocre at best, like the kitchen didn't really care when they made this. I ordered a C1 lan zhou soup and subbed knife sliced noodles for my entree. The soup broth had a pleasant taste. Although whoever cut my noodles needs to learn to be a little more uniform in their slicing. Some were really thin, and some were way too thick and not cooked in the middle. And the chili sauce which is on the table, they need to fix this. Has no flavor at all, it's not spicy, just tastes like straight oil and sesame. That was really disappointing. But they are a new restaurant and probably still figuring things out, so I'll give it another try in the future."}
{"text":"Great place, Authentic chinese Yunnan style. close to our house area. I tried once when they just opening the business . food was good cold chicken as apppetizer, Dan Dan noodle few more noodle soup."}
{"text":"A reproduction of the noodle king, it's the same setup, the same menu, probably the same owners. Perhaps a second location since the first one was doing so well. I still prefer the original but this one is pretty decent as well. Zha jiang mian and a stir fry noodle were essentially the same as the other place.  I like the knife cut noodles. Give it a try if you haven't had a lot of exposure to chinese noodles."}
{"text":"Flavorful and delicious food. The noodles are obviously fresh, and it's obvious when you eat them. They take great care in making their noodles, and it is fun to watch from the bar. The beef brisket and Mongolian beef were both tender and flavorful. I highly recommend checking this place out!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love the spicy wontons (flavor bombs, not really spicy at all), Chinese beef burritos, and the brisket soup with hand pulled thin noodles. DEFINITELY the brisket soup, broth is fantastic! I wanted to love their onion pancakes, and they had the chewy texture we asians love in breads, but it was heavy as increasingly hard and gummy as it cooled. I come back for the soup and the wontons all the time."}
{"text":"I think we should take it easy for a little bit - the magics gone.  The soup is uninspiring, bland and the hand pulled noodle is on the average side.  I ordered the lan zhou noodles seeing that this place is from lan zhou.  My friend ordered the beef noodles and i can tell the soup is watery too.  The fried dumpling was good.  Just not impressed, i like other places better now that all these hand pulled noodles are cropping up everywhere."}
{"text":"Yes, yes and yes.  Everything. It was all amazing and cheap. They make the noodles fresh and you can watch. It's like a kid in a candy store   What to get:  Dumplings Fried rice C7 C4  The service was good. Don't be stupid like me and wear white.  That is all."}
{"text":"The place is clean.friendly staff.u can watch how the noodles are made.must try beef burrito and beef brisket noodles"}
{"text":"It was really super tasty.this place is clean,inviting the price no place can beat .I will be back.highly recommend"}
{"text":"Their Szechuan Beef Brisket Noodle (C4) is a must-have! It has the right amount of spicy and tangy-ness that keeps me coming back for more. I like it the most with thin noodles. I also recommend the Spicy Wontons - they are just as good as the ones found in Din Tai Fung, a popular joint found in the LA area; their Steamed Chicken with Chili Sauce, and Sweet and Sour Black Fungas Salad (weird, but so tasty and apparently very healthy!). I love how this location is in the Southwest area so I can always just stop by and have a quick dinner. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This brand new spot features delicious Chinese hand pulled noodles featured in delicious broths and sauces.  Beef Brisket Noodle (soup) - DELICIOUS. The broth is truly amazing and reminiscent of Oxtail soup, but better lol. The noodles and their variance in thickness was very pleasant in this flavorful but light broth.  The meat was so tender and again very flavorful.    House Chow Mein Noodles - Featured a variety of veggies and meats but was very flavorful. Definitely not your average chow Mein!  Spicy Won Ton - Good, not what I was expecting but very good nonetheless.  Beef Pancake - So fun and yummy! It says 3 pieces but they're not small pieces at all, so do get it!   Food:  Great. Fun environment, entertaining to watch and all in all great.  The noodles they give you in each meal is A LOT - don't be like us and eat so fast you get full quickly lol.  -1 Star on Service: Serving slightly slow but they're new and trying to figure out their systems and processes, as with all new restaurants.  Plus they have to hand make your noodles so I do appreciate that.  I look forward to them growing and settling in their processes.  Delicious and enjoyable, I highly recommend and will visit again!"}
{"text":"Really solid noodle place, very reasonably priced- fantastic in fact for the quality and portion size. Service was good, and they make their noodles fresh in the open concept kitchen. Spicy wontons were a great starter, a little on the spicy side but it's all in the oil.  Beef chow mein was excellent. A little greasy but really great flavors. Just needed a bit of texture but all in all very good noodles. 4.5/5 stars"}
{"text":"Good.  Definitely go with the knife cut noodles.  It's a bit out of the way but worth it."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome!! Wish I could post the video how they make the noodle fresh. The waiters were very attentive i love that!"}
{"text":"Literally a one of a kind authentic experience. I was basic and got the mongolian beef. it was spicy but i finished the whole damn thing"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, hand pulled noodles made fresh to order.  We started with the spicy dumplings they were delicious, not too spicy and an order is enough for 2 people. I ordered the Mongolian beef chow mein it was not what I expected, it was way better. The beef was tender and flavorful. My friend ordered the beef brisket noodle, the broth was excellent. Large portions, reasonably priced and friendly staff.  I highly recommend this  restaurant"}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere. Vegas is expanding it's ramen options and providing options like this near 215 and Tropicana is a treat. The real advantage is that there are so many different soup and stir fried options which are flavorful and complex you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I got the chicken chow mein and my boyfriend got the Mongolian beef chow mein. They make the noodles in front of you. We loved every bit. My boyfriend ate his and the rest of mine lol. Definitely fast service for handmade noodles."}
{"text":"We were so happy for The Magic Noodle to finally open, as the other noodle house we go to is very far away.  The restaurant is really nice - they've done a fantastic job of decorating, and the kitchen is open so you can see the chef making the hand-pulled noodles and doing all of the food preparation.  We were greeted immediately and given a table and menus.  We do wish the menus had descriptions of the items so that we could better know what they were.  My daughter and I split the Chicken Fried Rice and Chicken Chow Mein.  The Fried Rice was to die for, and the best we have ever had!  The Chow Mein was delicious as well, and the noodles had great texture - we went with the original noodle, but next time may try a different style.  Overall, we were very pleased with our meal, although they do not have Diet Coke which we're hoping they will decide to get in for the future as that would have made our meal perfect.  We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This place was legit when it come to home made noodles.  They make.them fresh for every meal. The service started out really excellent but then they brought someone else's order out before we got ours.  OK noticed that the order came out in order.  Either was the waiter was good and we got some really good things.  The Wonton with added noodles was tasty but on the bland side.  Good for people in restricted diet.  The Mongolian fried noodles had a slight kick to it.  It didn't taste like Mongolian beef it lacked the green onions but it was still full of flavor.  Beef was tender and noodles aldenti. The garlic chicken was very garlicky for the others not so much for me.  It did have a kick at the end.   The onion cakes were crisp and thin.  It didn't get 5 stars for the price it was 5.99 and oil am use to paying less than 4.00 or even way less.  Beef brisket soup noodles was very tasty I wish it has some spicy to it.   The  Chicken chow mein was on the bland and but it was okay for seniors.  The pork belly with string beans was very favorable and the pork belly melted in your mouth.  Overall it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Magic noodle is amazing. I wanted something different that I've never tried. Ramen is squally my go to and seafood soup but I must say I have a new favorite. The thick wide noodles for the beef brisket was delicious ! The texture of the noodles and beef was so soft and tender. Would recommend to anyone. Also , cured my hangover lol. The staff was very hospitable . They checked on us our entire stay and engaged with some jokes here and there. The service and food is on point. I will say it takes a bit of time to get your soup But again, the noodles are freshly handmade in front of you. Quality is what you are waiting for"}
{"text":"So tasty. had the Chong Qing Style Spicy Noodle w/ the Knife Cut Noodles item C7 on the menu for lunch and it was savory spicy goodness. I buried my face in that bowl of noodles and didn't come up for a breath until I was done. There was a lot going on in that bowl, spicy broth, minced meat, diced peanut, bean, onion, vegetable and of course the shaved noodle. When my focus wasn't totally on that bowl I watched the kitchen chefs preparing the dishes through a large glass window for the other patrons, entertaining for me. The establishment is clean and the serving staff are great. I haven't had a better bowl of noodles."}
{"text":"Always delicious and hot. I love this place and my favorite is the Spicy Wonton and I just tried the Chicken Chow Mien with knife cut noodles. Perfect. The service is amazing and always friendly. We are Happy Customers."}
{"text":"cool that they are hand made noodle and you can watch the guy make them... still very greasy"}
{"text":"I don't want to post this review because it's a small place and already super popular but seriously, great stuff here and they make your noodles right in front of you! So delicious!"}
{"text":"We ordered food to go, so maybe that detracts from the food a bit.  The beef wraps were tasty but small and more expensive than other places.  The beef noodle soup wasn't too impressive.  The broth didn't stand out and the noodles were a little too soft for my liking.  The beef was tender but again could use more flavor.  I'll probably have to give them a try in person before I write them off, but so far I think Noodle Man and Shang Artisan are more impressive."}
{"text":"Seriously the best ramen and chow mein EVER. They make all their noodles. We had chicken chow mein, and spicy brisket ramen. Meat was soooo tender and full of flavor. We will 100% be back. Customer service was amazing. They were all VERY attentive. We will be back. Thank you."}
{"text":"Omg! Fall in love with this place at the first time!  Soooooooo yummy!  The taste of noodles is more delicious than the pictures!"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant in a popular strip mall that has pretty much all types of options. My boyfriend ate here before and he recommended we go for dinner. It doesn't seat very many, maybe 25-30 people max? Clean and barely smelled of food until the people next to us got their order. I got the Vegetable Chou Mein and he got the Szechwan Beef Brisket. These are good portions, might even need a take home box. I would wish for hot tea as an option vs just cold drinks, as hot soup and cold drinks don't really go well for digestion. And perhaps a non-spicy egg/spring roll to enjoy since not everyone eats spicy? It seems they do a lot of to-go business too since there's not a lot of seating. We ate well for under $20 w just water to drink."}
{"text":"The Mongolian Beef Chow mien is the bomb!  I ordered the beef noodle soup (spicy) to go ... I think it would have been better eaten at the restaurant.  The price is very reasonable and the noodle pulling is a delight to watch!"}
{"text":"The food was 4 stars.  Why 3 rating?    1) I ordered an appetizer and a main - the main came out 4 minutes after I ordered and the appetizer arrived when I was 1/2 way through my main. I had a feeling I should have ordered the app and just waited.  But I thought I would give the service a try on timing.   2) If you are going to run an open kitchen and seat people along the counter area by the glass to watch -  be ready for all eyes on you.  You are the show.  You are the star.   2a) If you're going have an open kitchen with glass - the glass should be clean.  It was not.  I'm not talking about a little flour from the hand made / tossed noodles being on the glass...I'm talking the glass was hazy and needed attention. 3) The containers on the tables that hold - Chili Oil, Soy Sauce, and Black Vinegar were dirty.  The spoons looked like they've not been changed in a long time and the dried crusty residue around the top of the lids was nasty.  May take a bit of effort but when a customer is finished dining the  spoons should be changed and the lids should be wiped down.  Perhaps keeping the condiments \"to serve\" would be a better remedy instead of leaving them out on every table.   4) One employee came into the open kitchen. He wasn't wearing gloves.  He reached into his pocket, pulled out his wallet, went inside and brought out a sum of cash.  He began to count and fan it.   He put it back in the wallet and walked behind the rear curtain (you could still see his legs)  4a) Another employee came from behind the curtain and when he did you could see the employee from (4) peeling fresh leafy vegetables with his bare hands.   He never washed his hands from handling dirty money.  5) When I informed my server of the situation he said he wasn't a manager but would tell them.  He went in the back for a minute or two and came back out to me and said \"thank you' 6) The employee that needed to wash his hands was still standing doing his work.   I then said to the server - HE NEEDS TO WASH HIS HANDS NOW.  He went back and had the person washed his hands.    They are still a new place.  The food was indeed delicious.  Am I a bit worried about eating my full meal and watching the sanitary habits of the employees?  Yeah....just a bit.  If you have an open restaurant like this you need to be on TOP of sanitation and all employees need to be handling food properly.  I will try it again.  I hope what I noticed the first time doesn't happen again or to anyone else."}
{"text":"Hot and new noods!  If you're in a mood for good noods, try the Magic Noodle, where we got a free show with our delicious meal.  When we arrived last night, we were seated immediately although we probably came at just the right time because the place was full of patrons.  Mr. Wang was pulling noodles almost the whole time we were there (I only know his name because I asked our server who that hard-working bespectacled fellow was behind the glass).  That's the free show part.  The delicious part came when we had our noodles. I chose the knife cut noodles for the Beef Brisket soup.  These noodles were just the right consistency, not too firm and not too soft.  I loved the tender beef brisket served with the soup, as well, with its nice flavor and quite a generous amount of beef.  Service was great throughout our meal as we were checked on often and our water glasses were never empty.  I would definitely recommend this place for a magical meal."}
{"text":"Love this place I come once a week. There soup the noodles the pancakes mmmmmmm they all hit the spot."}
{"text":"It's a small restaurant but the people are nice, and the food is great!  Try the panckes and the fried rice"}
{"text":"Happened to notice this restaurant while headed to another restaurant in the same shopping center. Decided to try it and SO glad we did. We tried the Beef Brisket Noodle, Spicy Pork Rib Noodle and Braised Pork Belly and Green Bean Chow Mein. Everything was outstanding. My kids - one the pickiest eater alive - both ate multiple bowls of the chow mein and beef brisket soup. This place is a winner."}
{"text":"Good noodle soup place. I had the need brisket soup. The broth is solid, not quite the best I have had (that belongs to a restaurant in Atlanta), but competently prepared and flavorful. The beef also wasn't quite the best I have had (one or two pieces were a bit tough), but no serious complaints. The noodles themselves are the highlight. The service was friendly. And the prices are reasonable--$9 for a solid dinner."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  I am so happy that I had no clue what I wanted to eat.  My son and I just opened the yelp app and looked through the list of things near the area we were in.  He thought the name was amusing and asked if we could try it.   We walked in and were greeted by a smiling face.  He sat us immediately and got some drinks right out to our table.  I cannot even describe how delicious the place smelled.  I had no clue what dish was creating it, but I was hoping that whatever I chose would be it.  While we decided, my son was entrances watching one of the chefs making the noodles that they use in their dishes.   The staff remained attentive through the whole meal even as the restaurant filled.  Every dish we ordered was absolutely scrumptious.   I cannot use the word AMAZING enough for The Magic Noodle. The atmosphere is AMAZING.   The staff is AMAZING.  The food is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.  And the price is definitely AMAZING for all that they offer.   This is definitely a must visit again and again.  (By the way...  The smell that got me was the Mongolian Beef Chow Mein)"}
{"text":"Very poor service.  They do understand what you are saying:ordering & or lose your order.  First visit we set down and had to order three times before I got what ordered.  Last night my wife called in an order & when I got there 20 minutes later they had done nothing for our order with only one table of customers in the restaurant.  I just walked out & bought dinner elsewhere.  Never going back."}
{"text":"When I tell you.... the pork pancakes..... and the veggie ones delicious. I really wanted to give them 5 stars.... but the veggies on the kung pao chicken were to thick cut. However, the flavor was definitely on point. Now the service was another story. It was ok at first.. we were eating our meal when the waiter came over and insisted we pay. He didn't even ask if we wanted anything else. He said it was shift change. Ok... I understand that, but it appeared that he came looking for a tip. Sorry but now you're not getting one. Other then that.... everything was good."}
{"text":"First time experience at a Chinese Noodle restaurant. The decor is modern and through the large glass windows into the kitchen, you can watch them make the noodles. I came because I love Pho and Ramen so I wanted to give Chinese Noodle Soup a try. The presentation is made my mouth water as you can imagine by the picture. I had the spicy beef noodle soup (can't remember the actual name). It was really tasty and quite spicy but I didn't realize this dish is a ground beef dish which isn't my preference. I will come back and try another soup. It was really inexpensive as well. I left under $10!! Service was very fast as well. I do recommend this place. Give it a try next time you're in the area."}
{"text":"I really liked the Lan Zhou noodles! They were delicious. Also the cold cucumber appetizer was super garlicky, sour and delicious. Plus points for the Chinese TV in the background that was playing some delicious looking cooking show. My fiancee got the Chong Ching noodles, which were pleasantly mala.  This feels like a strange reason to knock the review down a peg, but I did notice that this restaurant has no ambient music. Maybe it was the day I was there, but there was no background music at all. This lead to easily hearing conversations in the kitchen, as well as from other customers. I prefer there at least to be some background music to set the tone. As it was...it just felt quiet. I would have appreciated some tone-setting tunes.  We're getting down to the nitty gritty again, but the owner/server seemed like in a big rush to do everything- set down utensils, clear tables, and take orders. Not that it's bad to do things quickly, but I picked up a rushed, almost frantic vibe. I guess it's good for speed of service though.  Price is great, service is quick. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had the Veggie Chow Mein with the fat noodles. I do say this has been some of the best noodles I've eaten in a long time. The sauce was flavorful and the helpings were sufficient. I recommend this place."}
