{"text":"Great service,  good food.  Would return.  Rating this just a three because there are only five reviews now and all are 5 stars.  This is not a five star place."}
{"text":"Luca's is closed and reopened as The Treehouse Cafe.  I was excited to see a cafe in the area but disappointingly, it's just Luca's 2.0 minus the pizza, delivery and family-friendly hours.  The best things about it are the Luca's breadsticks, Luca's chocolate chip cookies, and the woman (I believe she may be the owner) is very friendly."}
{"text":"Beautiful little bistro in a gorgeous / classy environment. It is located near a country club. The server is ready to be your best friend. I think I heard him whistling as he was making my food. He loves his job. The food was fresh and tasted excellent."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza by the slice. Great subs worth a try and very filling. Right next to golf course. Get a drink from the coffee bar. Really fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Solid, above average pizza.  Can get a little hot inside in the summer with the pizza ovens blasting away."}
{"text":"Great pizza with a friendly staff.   Small place but good for a casual Italian meal.  Menu is typical pizza shop,  but the food is well made.   Pizza dough is top notch and they use good ingredients.   I'm usually there with my family and it is kid friendly."}
