{"text":"Very bland!! Completely unexpected and disappointing after reading all previous reviews."}
{"text":"Persian food is what I grew up with and sure I spot a new place where u can find a Persian menu
I've been here for lunch. We ordered Koobideh and Barg
Both well cooked, tender and delicious (I might have some reservation for better places in Montreal but  it was above average in my taste)
The portion is big and an average (eating wise!) couple could share one plate
The staff were nice and welcoming and helpful in explaining their contribution to a traditional  Persian menu.
We were surprised with some Tahdig (A layer of thin bread and rice spread on the bottom of the pot, fried and crispy and greasy indeed) and we were even more surprised when the bill came with 30% opening month discount

The ambiance is just average

They could have put more of quality furniture I say

There is a parking lot in front of the restaurant and on a Sunday we had no difficulty in finding a free spot"}
{"text":"Out standing food with great customer service food is amazing and tasty, by Far one of the best Persian food I have ever tried . Highly recommend and my favorite dish is Onyx Special. 
Thank you team Onyx."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. The waitress was polite but the customer service by the owner was not good. We were a group of 25. So it may happen that the right food is not served to the right person by the waitress. But the way that the owner raised his voice at the event holder in front of his guests because of the mistake that the restaurant did was really disrespectful and disappointing !!!"}
{"text":"We had our weeding party in the restaurant. The weakness of our part is music band, they were not professional and they did not stay on the price that we talked about it. The head of the band lose his control and behaved so unprofessionally in front of my father-in-law. He throws the money in front of him and leaves the restaurant with so loud voice. 
Honestly, the music was not good.I suggest ignoring the music band. I believe Radio Javan works better for your party and it does not cost  350$ with a rude behavior.

Food, decorations, and service were perfect.  The food was so delicious. People worked so hard and their service is almost perfect."}
{"text":"I am Persian and I love Persian food, After reading reviews of Onyx I was excited to try this newly opened restaurant. 

Let's start with appearance, the outside was cute and welcoming, as for the inside it had no character, although it was very clean (because it's only a few months old) but it wasn't cozy and also it was very cold (had to put back on my coat).  Also, the restaurant is kinda like an L shape and towards the back, I'm guessing where the kitchen is, that's where they have the speakers for the music, they put up the volume so the people in the dining room could hear. Not a nice ambiance in my opinion.

Now let's get to what really matters: THE FOOD. They brought us warm pita bread and butter, which is what typical Persian restaurants do. We ordered mirza ghassemi (eggplant puree mix). The ingredients are suppose to be grilled eggplant (to give it a smokey flavour), tomatoes, garlic and beaten eggs. All mixed and pur√©ed together. Although it had that nice smokey taste that I love, they did not use tomatoes, instead they used tomato paste and I did not taste or see any beaten eggs. Portion was  good sized, but I prefer Quartier Perse's mirza ghassemi more.

For our main course we had joojeh (chicken brochette with bone) and chengeh (chunks of filet mignon alternated with peppers and onions)

The chicken was really not good, usually you don't give out a wing as a piece of brochette and the meat was brownish and not very well cooked. The filet mignon was even worse than the chicken, it had no seasoning, and the inside was raw. First and foremost your suppose to ask the client how do you want the cook to be and if you don't ask then you shouldn't make it raw.

The salad was typical garden salad but the dressing was very blahh probably mayo and ketchup mixed together.

The only good thing about the meal was the tea at the end, the waitress brought us a teapot with dates, sugar cubes and crystallized sugar. That was the highlight of the meal.

The staff was really not that much concerned, the waitress was either really nervous or really shy. She spoke very softly and it was very hard to hear what she is saying, after bringing our food she never asked if everything was okay and when she would come in the dining area it was always to bring food, she never looked around to see if anybody wanted something, we had to call out for her to come to our table.

The price of the food is cheap compared to other Iranian restaurant, but the quality is cheap too. They call themselves fine Persian dining but there was no finesse there. Your better off at Tehran or Quartier Perse, you might pay more but you will definitely get better quality.

-------------------------------------------------
After posting this review, the owner messaged me, and tried to tell me that my review was false and unfair. I replied to him explaining to him in more detail the issues we had, but instead of accepting my my honest opinion he said that my reviewed seamed \"fishy\" basically accusing me of purposely giving a bad review. He also added that I should not promote other Persian restaurants in my review of his restaurant and that I don't seem to be \"just\" a customer.  

I have work in customer relations for over 10 years and the first thing they teach you is the customer is always right, also never to argue with a customer.

I would to finish this update by adding thy I went To Onyx, I checked-in on Yelp as I always do when I go to a restaurant. I took pictures of the plates I had, as I usually do, and I wrote a review later and yes I compared the restaurants to others like them, this is what I usually do the same I do with all other restaurants. And Yes I was Just a customer, just having a meal and then just writings my honest opinion of it. Having this type of reaction to a review is very insulting and very unprofessional."}
{"text":"The food was good. We had the onyx 1 including Barg, Koobideh and Jooje among them Barg was the best. We also had Kashke Bademjoon as appetizer which was really tasty. The place is cozy but clean and calm."}
{"text":"Low quality food and desert. Awful service"}
