{"text":"Great food, friendly service! I often frequent Tamam's for lunch and they never dissappoint. The Lahmacun is a personal favourite"}
{"text":"Great spot to eat with awesome food! You gotta eat here! We had the falafel and lahmacun with nice salad. A few days later we went for breakfast, very pleased with both days."}
{"text":"I had a chicken shawarma wrap combo here last week. The wrap is huge, so I definitely didn't need the combo. The sandwich alone was more than enough food. 

I found the wrap had so many \"wet\" vegetables in it that it made the pita very soggy, so I'd probably ask them to keep out some of the wetter vegetables rather than go with everything next time. The vegetables definitely made up the majority of the wrap. There was significantly less chicken than vegetables in this wrap.

I did ask for it spicy, but it wasn't all that hot. Those who like mild spice should be happy.

Aside from the excessive moisture from the vegetables, this was a pretty tasty shawarma pita so I'd likely get it again."}
{"text":"This place is great, generous portions, wonderful flavour and good fresh ingredients. Staff and welcoming and friendly you really feel they care about their patrons and their food.

I work in an office nearby and this area is not great in terms of food options, I will be heading to Tamam's regularly from now on. What a gem."}
{"text":"Delicious food! I often travel to Toronto and Tamam's has been a must-go restaurant for me. It is a clean and family friendly restaurant with great food and service. As a person who grew up in countries with similar cuisines, I can tell that Tamam's serves quite authentic Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food.  I like the wide range of healthy options, especially the soups and juicy salads. My favorite dish is the Iskender Donair and I love their deserts.  Don't forget to complete your meal with Turkish coffee or tea!"}
{"text":"Came in with the fam because dad friend recommended and for me, just like in any place...if your workers are sitting down eating and resting something it up!

We got the beef shawarma in a wrap and it was just tasteless and bland. I couldn't even taste the humus! I don't recommend it, and it was hot as hell in there.  Well, the fries were good but I can make that at home."}
{"text":"Great food and great portions! Fast, friendly service. The hummus plate and chicken shawarma are excellent! They have \"traditional\" breakfast too, but why would ya when there's shawarma?

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken wrap and beef dinner plate, both are excellent. Love the combination of the refreshing salad and meat that are topped with some sort of sauce they put in. Will come back in the future."}
{"text":"Came here again after my good takeout experience. Unfortunately, like many restuarants, they had failed to keep it consistent. The shwarma meat was lukewarm and dry. The serving size noticeably shrunk.

I really thought I found a regular place to eat at. Oh well..."}
{"text":"Was disappointed fora 4 star rating. The chic shawarma was decent and generous portion size, however skip the tabouleh and baklava, they were awful."}
{"text":"I've been to the restaurant several times, as it was close to York University. Every time I went the food has been delicious. It nice that's there is a unique restaurant like this in the area. I have had the chicken shawarma and a few different Turkish pizzas and I would recommend them all."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, staff was friendly, we got it to go and it was ready pretty fast."}
{"text":"Ordered via the Just-eat app. Very happy with the tasty food received. Big enough portions for two people to share. Food was also delivered before the estimated delivery time. Would order again!!!"}
