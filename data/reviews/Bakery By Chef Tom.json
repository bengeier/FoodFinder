{"text":"Thanks  to Chef Tom and crew another downtown Glendale shopkeeper didn't starve today. I ordered a sandwich this morning and they even delivered it to me later in the day. Thanks  You are too good to me.  Barbie ~ Gypsy Chicken Marketplace"}
{"text":"Place was clean,  would be nice if there were more of a variety of sandwiches.  I gotta say the bread was good (sourdough).. fresh..."}
{"text":"They are never open. Their website states open daily . Monday-Friday: 7.30 a.m. to 3.30 p.m.  I've tried to go in several times for a cup of coffee and its like 9-10 am and they are still not open. The owner closes whenever he wants with no notice. He needs to change the information on his website if this continues. They also have a weak selection of items, just a few sandwiches and they never actually have any baked goods... weird considering it is a bakery!! It takes these people half an hour to make one sandwich! definitely not suitable for someone who is on a quick lunch break, you will spend your entire lunch waiting on your food to be prepared. I tried to give this place a chance but they just have poor customer service."}
{"text":"This is the greatest place!! If you are looking for a FAMILY OWNED AND OPERATED bakery/deli...well here it is!   Probably the most quaint location in the heart of downtown Glendale. Chef Tom is right there to make taste bud delights come to life!!  Come by during the summer and you lift find their Son, Duncan, delivering refreshing lemonade to sun beaten warriors of the concrete jungle!  And did I mention that Adriene Oftedahl Sanders is a Moon Valley Rockets Alum? So you have a local hometown family making it happen!  We stopped by to grab a sandwich and say \"Hi!\"  Show some love to your small business owners and get some great food in the process!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best gingerbread ever! My customers loved it! Not a crumb was left. And the price was amazing too!"}
{"text":"This place is great and Chef Tom and his wife are very welcoming! It's a quaint little shop that reminds me of a cigar store back home in NY and also has an East Coast deli feel. I haven't had the sandwiches because I'm a vegetarian but my hubby has and he loves them! I am, however, one who loves baked goods, and this place doesn't disappoint! They have a dessert called the doughfin (lemon poppy muffin with a donut consistency inside) that's to die for, and just the other day, they introduced us to their regular and chocolate chip homemade coconut macaroons which were melt in your mouth delicious! This place is a must when visiting the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Made to order fresh sandwiches with Boars head deli meat shall I say more. The cookies are awesome as well ,I'll definitely be coming back.Thanks chef tom"}
{"text":"Wow, this bakery is so awesome! First time here and I love it. A local mom and pop store. I had coffee and 2 of his homemade cookies. They were great ! Tom and his staff are very friendly. They have comfortable seating as well. They also offer some deli sandwiches as well. I am looking forward to trying those at a later date. The shop is very clean as well.  5 stars for sure !"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat in Old Town Glendale that had outside seating, we stumbled upon this place. I am so glad we did. The deli sandwich was delicious, the pickles were terrific, but the snicker doodles were amazing. Great food, wonderful customer service! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Came here with family for lunch and we sat outside on the patio enjoying the weather and some amazing deli sandwiches. There was a great list of sandwich toppings that were all appetizing and the cookies are amazing!"}
{"text":"Not really a bakery, not a sparkling eatery either so I didn't eat the free sandwiches offered to residents at Councilman Aldama's mobile office. Just the look of the dreary place was a turnoff."}
{"text":"I bought two kinds of Cupcakes, strawberry with preservers and fresh strawberries and cream cheese with gram cracker crumble. Yum!"}
