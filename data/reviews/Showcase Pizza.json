{"text":"Got an extra large buffalo pizza. All they did to make this extra large was stretch out a smaller dough. It was so thin that I couldn't pick it up. What a complete waste of money. Will never eat from here again."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I ever tried!!! We love the \"My Big Fat Greek Pizza\" LOVE IT!!!!"}
{"text":"This pizza is OUTSTANDING!!! Best one is MY BIG FAT GREEK PIZZA and the BLUE HAWAII-AN... Can't wait to visit my daughter's family in Pittsburgh and coming to this place for sure!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The spongebob square pizza is my absolute favorite. Their wings are great, too. If you haven't tried this place, you're seriously missing out!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. We are NEVER disappointed. They are almost always early and never late. There hasn't been one thing that we've ordered that we didn't like. Awesome quantities and in general incredible food. ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"Pizza is gross..Sauce: taste like plain tomato paste, cheese milky and cheap (no tang or saltiness like good romano or parmesan blend), crust very doughy and bland, and soggy..super let down, just gross nasty pizza. Not worth your money..service was good atleast."}
{"text":"We tried their pizza for the first time last night We ordered the Sponge Bob Square Pie, mozzarella sticks & mac & cheeses bites. We did not care for the taste of the pizza at all. I also didn't care for the sauce that came with the mozzarella sticks. It was $30 for a pizza and two small sides. I ended up throwing the pizza out as it was not good at all. We will not be ordering from here again. We just did not care for the taste of the food at all."}
