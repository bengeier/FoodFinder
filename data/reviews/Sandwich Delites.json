{"text":"I can see where this place would do well with the college crowd, but my experience will not bring me back.  The warning signs were all there....never have I seen an open kitchen with four (4) microwaves, and those were just the ones that were visible.  I went after the lunch rush and felt as if they were real pushy about placing an order while I was looking at the menu.  Ultimately I settled on trying a meatball sandwich.  I witnessed the preparation, then the dreaded microwave heating of it.  I took one bite into it and about lit my mouth on fire.  Additionally the sauce was absolutely horrendous.  I wrapped it up and tossed it in the nearest trash can.  Never again.  To be fair, I only tried it the one time, and did not give them a second chance, so take that for what it's worth."}
{"text":"another place that is great in berea- sandwich delites.  i have really fond memories of chilly autumn saturday afternoons after a rehearsal or something heading over to sandwich delites.  their sandwiches are colossally amazing.  one of those suckers with a dr. brown cherry soda?  yum yum in my tum tums.  that's my memories of a weekend afternoon back in the day. with all the good places that come and go, i'm glad this place is still around."}
{"text":"Normally, I agree with everything Kimberly K says. However, I think Sandwich Delites is one of the scariest eating establishments I have ever been. Granted it probably no longer smells like an ash tray, but when I went to B-W I ordered soup here and it tasted like burnt cigs. Yuck. I have more than one friend terrified of eating here."}
{"text":"Ugh...prepare for microwaved, poor-quality meat sandwiches if you come here. Sounds appealing, eh? I will say that the two guys I was with loved this place. It's kind of like a grungy/old-school diner mixed with a \"deli\" vibe.   The food? In my opinion, not good.  The owner of the place? Adorable, super sweet, and hilarious without knowing it. Example: She gave us a discount for no reason. (Cash only, by the way!) When she brought out my \"grilled chicken\" sandwich, she told me that it actual isn't grilled chicken, she's not sure why the sign says that! Apparently it hasn't changed in years. She just heats up the chicken that they send her (it was crispy chicken patties).  She also reported to me that she decided NOT to cut my chicken sandwich in half because it was going to slide all over the place and get really messy! So, I could do it myself if I wanted, but it was going to be messy!! ...Equal parts disturbing and funny/cute coming from her.  I want to support this place, but have to be honest and say that I won't visit again. The positives are that it is cheap and close to the Baldwin-Wallace campus."}
