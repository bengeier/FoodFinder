{"text":"First time here. Walked into the restaurant and half the tables I saw were piled with dirty dished with half eaten food on them (I have no idea how long they've been sitting there for). Waited 10minutes for servers to clean a table for us to sit. They used a dirty cloth to clean the table with!! I know this because the table smelt horrible after!! This definetly made me lose my apetite. I had to call the server 3 times to take down my order cause evertime i said \"excuse me\" she would brush me off and say \"wait a moment\" then go to the back to chat with her friends. (what the hell?!\") After the third time i was finally able to order, but had to wait another 30minutes for the food!! Service was sooooo SLOW! When i got my food, I tasted the curry and I thought it was okay but was really chunky compared to other places I've had. I know malaysian curry and this was definetly not worth a 45min drive to try. I dont think I'll be going back. The only thing i really really enjoyed was the Coconut Shrimp."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight with family. We ordered the chicken in pandan leaves, crispy ginger beef, beef curry with roti, assam laksa, prawn noodle soup, and had the mango sticky rice for dessert.   The crispy ginger beef was thoroughly crispy slices of beef, I didn't think beef could be this crispy until now. The assam laksa is a noodle soup filled with fish, pineapples, and onions, and topped with crispy pieces of tofu skin, a very unique blend of flavours. I really like this dish, and it's a dish that's hard to find around here, but this one might be more for the adventurous eater. The prawn noodle soup seemed bland after trying all the richly seasoned dishes at first, but then the more subtle flavours of the broth come through, and I realize it's kind of refreshing to have shrimp based broth for a change. And it comes with this shrimp sauce on the side that I wish they would sell in jars. It's like the shrimp version of onion jam.  I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch with family. The place is tucked away and kind of dark on the inside, but the servers were nice and the owner came out to say hi.   The food here is definitely authentic. The soup bases and sauces are all made by hand and you can taste the difference that brings. The prices are a bit high for the portion size if you're ordering regular foods and not any of their specials. They also have a hidden lunch specials menu that was advertised on the Chinese radio but didn't seem to be brought out. We had to ask specifically for it (as did the table next to us that came in later).  From the special menu, we ordered the penang shrimp soup noodles and the tom yum goong soup noodles. They both had a soft kick of spiciness that you'll appreciate until your lips go numb. The soup is fantastic for both of them, and the ingredients are fresh. The special menu items come with a drink as well, and all for $6. The winter melon longan drink (cold) is quite good and has a unique flavour - very refreshing for a hot summer day.   We also ordered the pad thai from the regular lunch menu. It comes with a spring roll and salad for $8. The noodles were good (again, well flavoured), but the spring roll was dry and the salad dressing wasn't very good. We also ordered the satay skewers (4 per serving), which were a bit chewy but the peanut sauce was fantastic. And lastly, the curry beef brisket with flaky pancakes ($8) - this was probably the most expensive dish simply because it was tiny. One person cannot get full on this, and for that price, that's a shame.  Overall, $35 for 3 people for lunch. Not bad. :)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my first visit to Coconut Island restaurant.  I was looking for some traditional Malaysian/Thai food, and ordered the Thai Chicken in Pandan Leaves and the Roti Canai with Chicken curry.  They were both great, ESPECIALLY the Chicken curry was amazing with a bit of spice!   I also enjoyed the Malaysian hot coffee for follow-up, it was somewhat sweet but I suppose that's how the 3-in-1 packs make it.  Definitely will be sure to try some more dishes next time!"}
{"text":"Coconut Island Restaurant does has lunch time specials and combos and I love spicy food and I decide to give it a try.  When I walked in the restaurant at 12:15 pm on a weekday, it was empty.. oh not a good sign. This place does have a funny and musky smell to it. and the interior of the restaurant is quite dark.  There are over 20 different lunch specials you can choose from starting from $6.50.  I decide on the Penang Pawn Noodle Soup for $6.50. I request for extra spicy. Yes the kitchen is slow! I waited over 15 minute for my noodle to arrive. There are 2 tiny shrimps on top, with a few tiny piece of chicken, tofu and half an egg. The broth is NOT spicy at all... and it tasted pretty bland. Usually Malaysian food has a really strong taste and flavour and my noodle has none of that!   OK it taste like something I a lousy cook would have make it at home! If I want my own cooking.. I will have stay home!  There is only 1 waitress working during lunch time.. and to serve the 3 tables with 5 customers and she is so slow...... can't imagine if it is a full house.. but it is hard to think that it will be busy with the slow service and the quality of the food!  Don't go there if you are in a rush during lunch time! You will be so frustrated!  They accepts Cash only!"}
{"text":"Pros: Somewhat nice decor, a little tacky. Cons: Overpriced and worse than fast-food thai. Very slow service.  I was out for dinner with my parents and we were in the mood for curry so we gave it a try. It was Saturday night and there were only 2 other patrons in. The decor was a little dated but not dreary. Despite the lack of patrons, we stood by the door for nearly 2 minutes before someone set us down at a table. There seems to be only 1 waitress. Service was definitely not good. When she was bringing a toddler high chair for another customer, she accidentally hit my father with one of the legs. She stopped, looked at my dad, and then without a word just walked on. An simple 'sorry' would be nice.   The dinner menu selection was quite broad but when we ordered turns out some of the items were not available. We ordered thai fish cake, Pad Thai, and a Beef Brisket curry, and 2 orders of roti. The lone waitress kept pushing us to order some chinese vegetable dishes, not a good sign in a thai/malaysian restaurant.   Also, the prices were a bit high especially for the separate orders of roti. The dishes didn't come with any accompanying sides like most other restaurants. The curry was by itself $11. The roti are $5 for 2 pieces. So we spent $10 on roti alone.  The fish cake was the first to arrive. For $5.50 we got 4 tiny pieces of fish cake that were dripping in oil. It taste like some frozen fish cake that you buy at a supermarket. The Beef curry was a mixed-bag. Beef was quite well cooked, but the curry was watery lacked spices and flavour. Pad thai was OK, but the meat and shrimp were dry. And like the fish cake, it was very oily. If you ever had Pad Thai at Thai Express in a Toronto mall food court, that's much better than this.  We definitely would not visit again. There are several other Thai options just a block away and they are way better than this place."}
