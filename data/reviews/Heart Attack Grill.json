{"text":"HOLY HOT WAITRESS BATMAN!!!!!!!!! THIS PLACE IS THE SHIZZNIT!!!!!! So my boy and I saw the travel channel burger special on this joint a week before we went to Vegas and we were all like \" YO CUZ WE GOTS TO EATS THESE MEATS\". So the morning after our first rage session we  were the first customers in line when it opened. There was also an obnoxious German film crew trying to shoot in their restaurant. After being rude to one of the lovely waitresses and refusing to wear the awesome patients gown we got to experience probably the greatest tongue lashing I've ever witnessed. Dr.Jon came over and told the German douche bags what they could do with the hospital gowns if they didn't like them. Dr. Jon is a true american hero in my opinion because like any good American he knows what happens if you let a pushy German get their way. His vision of american  badassness is a shining beacon of our freedom and should be commended. The burgers, fries, and shakes are  tasty, the waitresses are friendly ,beautiful and playful. If you're downtown you owe it to America to eat here.    p.s. Dr. Jon if you ever read this know that you are awesome and I am now and forever your biggest fan.  Everyone I ever speak to that is heading to vegas will hear my tale of how my hero Dr. Jon vanquished the snotty Euro film crew sent here to mock our American right to do whatever the f%#ck we want to. I will eat here every time I visit Vegas until I die.   Just revisited this American gem and it was every bit as good as the last time. God bless America and and God bless the good men and women of the Heart attack Grill. Dr. Jon is even more baller than I remember, I'm pretty certain he is the smartest man to ever live."}
{"text":"I went with great expectations when I went to Las Vegas after reading news about them.  The whole experience was contrary to what I expected though.   First, the cash part.  Come on, what is the reason for not taking credit cards when the whole world accepts it?  That you might die and credit card might not get cleared?   Second, the menu.  Just a handful of items?  I was expecting something more than just a burger / fries and hot dog.   Third, the food itself.  If you make your burger in lard and is supposed to have 1000s of calories, it should be tasty, rt?  Or so I thought.  I finished it only because I just wanted to avoid a scene of arguing with them that I don't want spanking even if I did not finish food (though most of the people over there seemed to enjoy it - maybe I am the minority, but it was not fun for me).  I think it is the chilli that spoiled the taste of the burger.  But whatever it is, the taste was nothing to write about. Fourth, the ambiance.  I will rate the indoor atmosphere only at the same level of McDonalds or Burger King.   Fifth, the security - locked doors only to be opened by security after verifying you paid.  Why?  I mean, they seriously make you feel like you are in a mental assylum with the nurses costumes and the spanking machine in the middle.  No problem for me with a restaurant having security, but I have never seen any one watching at the door so closely as if people eating there might run away in the middle without paying. I definitely think they have a unique theme that can attract people.  But make a great tasty food worth the calories and improve the ambiance - it can be a game changer.  Also, please be a bit more family friendly or advise that this is not a family friendly place.  As a family man / Christian, this place has been my first big turnoff place in US.  I have been to a variety of restuarants before.  But this is the first one that I found to be odd - in an unpleasant way."}
{"text":"A stop at the Heart Attack Grill wasn't really part of our Vegas plan, but in a terrible fit of a need for dessert, we decided that a full-butter-fat milkshake would be an excellent idea and this did not disappoint!  I have to admit at first I was like \"Really?  You want me to put on a hospital gown?\" , but it IS Vegas so I played along without complaint and we were promptly seated at the bar.  As a fan of terrible B-movies, I greatly appreciated the gaudy and awful decor of the place...right down to the ripped off movie posters that had been altered to suit the Heart Attack Grill theme.  It was terrible, cheesy, awful....everything a diner like this should be!  Our Nurse at the bar was awesome.  She was cute, sassy, a little sarcastic, and a whole lot of fun!  They serve three classes of milkshakes: naughty, which are essentially your basic flavors, obscene with selections such as cheesecake and maple bacon, and XXX which contain flavored vodka.  We settled on the maple bacon but wanted to add the XXX element to it, so we requested an add of whipped cream vodka.  Our Nurse said no one has ever asked for that before.  I couldn't believe it!  Maple bacon milkshake with whipped cream vodka seemed like a perfect fit to me!  I think they should add it to the menu!  My boyfriend and I opted to share the milkshake, and good thing too!  Sure, it was an $11 milkshake, but they DO NOT skimp on the size!  Plus I'm pretty sure there were at least 6 slices of bacon, half a jar of maple syrup, and a double shot of vodka in the thing!  It was a beautiful masterpiece of everything you shouldn't feed to your body!  Fat, sugar, calories, booze....it was simply beautiful!  If you're truly on vacation and really wanting to do something that is completely \"Vegas\", a visit to the Heart Attack Grill is in order.  Don't expect to have any \"healthy\" options.  I've read reviews on here where people have complained about everything being fried in lard.  Duh.  If you expected anything else, you evidently didn't do your research first.  They do have a Vegan menu, 100% pure tobacco....meaning you can buy a pack of cigarettes.  We saw people getting hooked up to wine \"IVs\" and folks that didn't finish their burgers spanked with a paddle.  Was it the fanciest or highest quality meal we had while in Vegas, absolutely not, but it was the funnest!  Definitely made the list for a return trip on the next Vegas run!  Bypass burger, here I come!"}
{"text":"Three stars or the food. Four for the atmosphere. Five for the alcohol!  They make you wear a hospital gown. First time my shirt stayed clean eating chile. :)  Meat in the chile was grisly.  But the overall experience was great fun."}
{"text":"Lousy burger, loud atmosphere and overall lame experience. You'd think if burgers was the ONLY thing on your menu you'd do it right. and I was not a fan of wearing a hospital gown to lunch it was neither fun nor funny. but I suppose if you're really in the mood to eat and watch someone get spanked then this is a good place?"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, food was so-so.  I think they could tweak a few things and make it better.  The whole premise of the restaurant is to be unhealthy as possible.  Fries cooked in lard, 9000+ calorie burgers, butterfat shakes, Luck strike smokes and beer.  You get the picture.  They only accept cash and you have to wear a hospital gown when you enter.  Would I go back?  Probably not,."}
{"text":"What a burger that was but the lard fries and butter fat shake was a semi-fail. HAG is a fun place to eat at, having a large scale outside for those who weigh over 350 can eat free there. I saw one guy who was scaled and surpassed that minimum. Sirens went off as the nurse waitresses and doctor owner was cheering him on. Wow....cheering for a guy that is vastly obese.  Continuing about the food, the burger was very tasty which I added 10 strips of bacon to. The fries were soggy and drenched in oil. The shake as it was made with butter fat was way too buttery and gave me a headache.  3stars for the burger and fun-friendly restaurant atmosphere. 1-star for the promotion of the obese"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Sure there was a lot of hype and that's why we went. We didn't go for a filet mignon to write home about, but we did receive decent food and a great atmosphere. Where else can you go and enjoy a meal with an enthusiastic restaurant and the friendliest service around? We even ran into the owner and he stopped what he was doing to take a picture with my wife, without hesitation! We were able to finish our meals and forgo the spanking, but it sure was fun watching others fail and receive their comeuppance."}
{"text":"I enjoyed coming here, I've seen this place a few times and finally came in, ordered the quadruple bypass burger and chili fries, sat at the bar and cracked some jokes with the nice bartender Tracy. Finished my burger and was on my way \"stuffed\" no spanking for me"}
{"text":"Walked by this place many times. Walked in and sat down but the smell of grease just couldn't allow me to stay. Just Google \"Dirty Dining Las Vegas\" and you will see what you are eating at this place.  40 Demerits by health district and when asked by the news reporter if the owner wishes to explain their side of the story, the owner comes and physically pushes the report out of the restaurant.  I WONDER WHAT THEY HAVE TO HIDE!!!?!?  The burgers are dry and just flavored with the cheese and bacon thats on the burger.  Stick with IN N OUT ...."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely a must for the experience. From a medical professional view, seeing the client in gown and nurses serving is just hilarious. I can say that the service was excellent as well. Drinking from an IV line was an experience. The only dowfall of this place is once you try it, you know you won't go back. The food isn't quite the best. I know its a fast food place, but the meat has no flavor to it and the fries tasted like they were cooked hours ago and reheated.  I'm giving 9/10 for the experience but only a 2/10 the food."}
{"text":"Great cheeseburger with a giant Mexican Coke....oh yah, pretty college girls in tight nurses outfits.  I'm a fan.  A little hokey, but the food is good and at a fair price."}
{"text":"This place was good,my cousin recommended it since she seen it on Man vs Food. I'm not huge burger fanatic but I went with the majority of the group. All burgers come with chili which wasn't bad and fries do not come with the burger. I had a single bypass burger for 9 bucks and only bottle soda but it was ok. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This place is all about the gimmick.  Greasy, tasteless food.  It offers free meals to those over 350 lbs.  It's probably not a good idea to encourage someone with obvious weight issues with free food."}
{"text":"After 3 trips to Vegas and never checking this place out I finally did, and wow what a great time!   Enormous servings, food tasted great, servers were fantastic and super friendly.  If you've got a great sense of humour you gotta check out this place.  Novelties galore.  Dr. Jon the owner is fabulous great novelty ideas and fun place to check out when on Fremont Street!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe go to get a picture of the place with friends and family standing on the outside scale - that's funny!  Anyone over 300 pounds eats for free!    But the food is horrid - burgers are tasteless and the fries are doused in lard - yucky to the max!  The shakes however are super yummy but you can really only consume about 3 bites of that before you're conscience speaks up and reminds you the calories aren't worth the yumminess.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME EATING HERE.  It's a joke so enjoy the exterior for what it is but don't even think about going in."}
{"text":"Really, really not good.  I was really looking forward to this place since there had been so much hype about it. And it was not good even a little bit.  I'll tell you too, I eat burgers. I eat a lot of burgers. Probably 4 or 5 times a week I have a hunk of cow in my mouth.  So my boss and I decided to take off from the base and head down to Heart Attack for lunch on a Monday. When you first arrive, they throw a hospital gown on you and have you take your seat. This is where the first problem shows up: the waitress.  This woman was duuuuuuuuumb. I really hope for the sake of humanity that they make them act like that for tips or something. She was Air-headimus Maximus and would not stop talking. She might be hands down the most annoying waitress I've ever encountered.   I won't mention the out of nowhere 70's music they were playing (is it 70's themed? Isn't it 50's diner themed? Or is it hospital themed?), what I really want to focus on is the food.  I heard they don't serve water, which isn't true, they serve bottled water, so I got that.   The fries, surprisingly, were the highlight. I know some reviews mentioned that the fries were nothing special and didn't compliment the burger very well. But I found the fries to be the most enjoyable part.  And then the burger.....  I got a single bypass (about half a pound of meat with cheese, grilled onions, lettuce and tomato) and decided not to opt for the 5 bacon slices.   I don't know where to start with this burger. Dry/cracking bun, too-tough burger meat, soggy (and kind of gross) onions, and the cheese looked like they laid it on after they cooked it. Everything about the burger looked and tasted wrong, and not wrong in a calorie way, but wrong in a \"that's not a hamburger\" way.  I think one of the lower end places I go for a burger is Whiskey Dicks on Craig Rd near the base, and I went there today and was blown away by how much better the burger was.   My boss agreed that Heart Attack Grill is never going to get our time and money again.  If you're over 350 pounds, go ahead for the free burger (note that fries and drink are NOT included for you), but if your a looking for a better burger than Heart Attack, Jack in the Box and Carl's Jr. are right down the street."}
{"text":"There are quite a few unique things about this place, drinks are bottled water, bottled coke, Corona or Bud (there is no tap water as they have no glasses). There are really only two things on the menu, a burger (either Single, Double, Triple or Quadruple Bypass) with or without cheese and an endless order or fries. They had a toppings bar with pickles, jalapenos, tomatoes and onions but no lettuce (it's considered health food). There is mustard, mayonnaise, ketchup and vinegar but no hot sauce.  For $499 you can get a membership and can eat 3 meals a day every day of the year if you'd like. Another schitck they have is if you weigh in excess of 350 lbs your meal is on the house (you can eat there 3 times a day if you please). And there is currently an eating challenge for an individual to complete a Quadruple Bypass in a single sitting but I don't think you receive anything. They have the fasted time at around 2:30 minutes currently.  I ordered a Single Bypass with cheese and the french fries. The fries were tasty but not nearly as crispy as I'd like. They were quite limp which actually made it somewhat hard to dip them in the ketchup. They were extremely fresh though, they cut and make them almost non-stop throughout the day. However they are fried in lard and are extremely greasy.  The burger was good but certainly nothing I couldn't whip up at home. Mine was slightly undercooked for my liking but not enough to have them recook it. They use a 70/30 beef to fat patty, which for me is too much. On top of that they add pork fat while cooking and dip the buns in  pork fat as well. As you can tell they're very much into excess here. For all the added calories there is not sufficient added taste.  The whole thing is over-the-top and cheesy but I guess you can say you come here for the experience more than anything and for that it's more than worth the $10 and the food is at least acceptable. It's really more of a show than anything else. I was hoping to get to see someone attempt the Quadruple Bypass but sadly I didn't get to witness one. It's somewhat strange but families, with young children, tend to eat here a lot too. I don't know how I'd feel about bringing my kids here, not quite the right place. The staff and the crowd was quite enjoyable. I'd eat here occasionally if I lived near by, if only for a good time.  I have photos and a more in depth review on my personal blog."}
{"text":"Massive burgers but average quality. You have to put on hospital gowns when you go in. There are  a few othe gimmicks such as wine being served on an IV drip. You cant buy drinks as a mixer. You need to buy a whole bottle of spirt and mix yourself.  The food is all served with disposable cutlery and plates.  Lastly you get spanked if you dont eat all your food. It would be good for a group of lads or girls on a night out byt not really for familys or couples. Will have to try the english looking pub accross the road next time."}
{"text":"A group of my friends and I went to Vegas for the big fight and since we were staying on Fremont we decided to check it out.  Service was ok at best, I ordered a double burger and fries.  Fries were barely room temp and the burger was the same.  Food tasted very bland, meat on the burger was very low quality and had no flavor at all.  Fries were disgusting, and not fresh, they tasted as if you left McDonald's fries in your car for a day and tried to eat them.  Overall it's just a shitty place."}
{"text":"BURGER WAS PRE-MADE.  Avoid. Went for the gimmick & what I heard was a great burger.  Received a cold, pre-made burger missing half the toppings (1 person in our group ordered no special sauce or onions therefore, no one got special sauce or onions).  Fries were soggy. The waitress came by litterally three times total.  To take our order, to deliver the food, to deliver our check.  She even had the nerve to give attitude to one person who tried to order water.  I understand that is their gimmick but, you can respectfully state you dont serve water.  Beer selection was horrible.  Should've went to Fatburger, at least I would have had taste with my calories."}
{"text":"The most funnest, un-PC place you will ever visit  The Heart Attack Grill is way fun and a unique experience in the downtown area. Right away they dress everybody in a hospital gown and wristband and you're escorted to your table by a scantily clad \"nurse.\" At first we were like wtf is this?  The menu is really limited, mostly diner fare, massive burgers, fries etc. (don't expect any culinary fireworks). They have milkshakes served with a pat on butter on top, wine in an IV bag, and your \"medicinal liquor\" is administered in a pill vial. They don't serve any diet pop.  I ordered the candy cigarettes only because they are banned where I come from!  The decor is retro kitsch, complete with a large painting of a pin-up nurse riding a large cigarette. The other diners tend to be on the more rowdier side, especially if a guy is being paddled by a nurse. Don't see that everyday!    Sure it's a gimmicky place, but we had a great time. 'Murica!"}
{"text":"Ok, there are two problems with this place.  First, the food.  It is only ok.  The fries are quite good, the hamburgers are serviceable.  The shakes are pretty tasty, but not noteworthy.  If you go, you are going for the fun theme, right?  The place has a weird vibe.  There wasn't much energy or fun happening, at least when I was there.   Overall: Ok, not great.  Oh, I felt like I had eaten a bag of cement about an hour after drinking only 1/8 of the shake. Oh yeah, cash only."}
{"text":"A very cool concept but the food is mediocre, I was expecting the food to be better but overall I would recommend eating here at least once. I really liked the theme and ended up eating 5000 calories lol."}
{"text":"This place is so bad, in every way, that it actually ruined an otherwise fun night out for me and some friends. The food is just plain nasty, and the slimy owner will, seriously, throw you out if you don't want to wear the patient costume.  Got that?  You're REQUIRED to wear a patient smock while you eat or be thrown out.  You cannot even order a glass of water; they won't serve it to you.  Isn't that funny?  Because it won't make you fat!  (And he can't charge you for it.)  What's next?  A cigarette-themed restaurant?  Dog-fighting?  It's a mean-spirited, bad restaurant based solely on one tasteless joke and a prominent location. I don't care how drunk you are.  Don't do it. You'll be very sorry.  Let me just summarize: this is the worst restaurant, novelty or otherwise, that I've ever had the misfortune to patronize."}
{"text":"Survival of thie fittest stays true again today. Order a bottomless fries and a water and just stare at the girls for an hour. 2 BUCKS."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at the Heart Attack Grill is great! A very creative menu and you get to wear a hospital gown while you eat! The neat part is their drink selection. Wine comes on an IV pole in an IV bag, you can buy a shot of liquor in a personalized pill bottle, and the \"peniscillin\" shots are hilarious! Food wise, it's your standard hamburger, hot dog, and fries. If you don't finish your burger though, you get spanked with a paddle by your waitress! Great to go in a group."}
{"text":"I love a good burger! But...  Food is disgusting and the whole place is a grease trap.  Burger was soggy from the grease and the fries were not anywhere near crispy, but limp and skinny. With all of the gimmicks- you'd think the owner would have the decency to try and sell food that is edible."}
{"text":"This place is just a gimmick, so if you don't mind paying just to find that out you will be ok here, but I wonder how many repeat customers they get.  Outside the restaurant you have the option to weigh yourself before and after the gluttony and when you arrive inside you are greeted by a couple of gals in nurse uniforms and instructed to put on a hospital gown. Ok, I thought, if I spill I am safe! You will be instructed CASH ONLY.   The food is gross. They must make about 500 burgers at a shot because you can't choose how you want your burger done and when you do get it, the thing is a dried out piece of leather. Perhaps that is why they have to smother it in greasy chilli. As well, the 'chilli cheese fries' are some weak, skinny fries with a single slice of American processed cheese sitting under the greasy chilli and not at all melted. Be prepared, they don't even offer ice water so right there is the majority of your bill for just a couple of waters at an inflated price.  My Hubs tells me he enjoyed the meal. I still can't change my rating because a.) he is wrong and b.) the quality of the food is terrible.  The service seems to be good at first, but the initial friendliness of the waitresses is just a facade because the service is awful. Once they have been nice and cheerful with their initial greeting (which can come off as a bit insincere) it all goes down hill rapidly from there.   If you don't finish your burger be prepared to be 'spanked'~ literally. They don't take it easy either, you can sense the sting! We opted to split a single burger which was enough for us, but note they won't split anything more than a single."}
{"text":"Good food. Bad beer. Not a family friendly place"}
{"text":"This is a joint that I'll visit again!  Not an extensive menu but when you're making something awesome to begin with, why confuse people with other options?  Gigantic artery-clogging burgers fully laden with cheese, bacon, grilled onions, and enough beef to make a Texan think twice...  Fries cooked in PURE LARD and salted to perfection (they aren't crispy fries so don't expect them to be).  Unfortunately I was just passing through Vegas and I made it a point to stop here.  So I had to drive and had to skip out on the Jello \"Shot\".  It's equivalent to like 5 traditional jello shots, it's half vodka, and it comes in a huge syringe (which you get to keep).  Next time, I'm bringing a DD and I'm getting 4 of em.  And btw, the servers?  Beautiful ladies in skin-tight nurse outfits.  And I know it's probably required of them but they're very sweet gals too!"}
{"text":"I was there with my family. Too much fun & funny theme, if you do not mind that they spank you for not finishing the highest calory burger in the world, I highly suggest it  \"cash only\" & \"try wine\" :)))"}
{"text":"It's basically a big kitschy gimmick. They pride themselves on their unhealthy food. Which I would be fine with, IF the food was any good. The burger was dry and cooked to death and the fries I had were soggy. Several of the people I were with didn't like there's either. It was annoyingly loud and service was not very good. There were some amusing things about it but overall I wish I had gone somewhere else for dinner."}
{"text":"Try it once for the experience, but the food is disgusting and overpriced."}
{"text":"I drove from LA to Chandler with my roommate just try the heart attack grill. Naturally I had pretty high standards.   Heart attack grill met my wildest (and naughtiest) dreams.  First off the decor is amazing. Outside, inside, it was just great to be there and it felt so unique.   The food amazing. I finished the quadruple bypass in 9 minutes and enjoyed every bite. I could have eaten another double bypass but instead made a return trip to the all you can eat french fry bar. Which serves delicious fries. Plus the coke made with real sugar was delicious. Now I know why everyone from my dads generation always raves about the original coke.   Last but definitely not least was the nurses. Between the food and the nurses I felt like I would definitely be needing mouth to mouth by the end of the experience. The nurses are very attractive and friendly. Not to mention that the uniforms are a great sight.   I will definitely be making a return trip over the summer with more of my friends so they can experience the joy of the heart attack grill."}
{"text":"I guess if you are into the experience it's ok, but the food is gross ( like seriously it will have you questioning what a burger should be) anyways we shared a single and it as ok , you basically just come for the Ambiance which by the way it sucked because they are too cheap to get good mikes for karaoke, and the slaps get boring after a while. Don't waste your time go have a good tasting burger and do the slapping yourself."}
{"text":"This place is okay if you just want the experience, but the food is pretty bad. I ordered the chili cheese fries and they were pretty bad. I only had 1 or 2 tastes and could not finish them. They had no taste and were oily as heck. Hamburgers were super dry and huge. The only thing that was good was the hamburger buns and the service . Go for the experience, however order minimal food! I would never go back."}
{"text":"Just terrible. If you're thinking about going here, DON'T! My family was very excited to come to the grill. We thought it was going to be the highlight of our trip, but it was absolutely horrific. We love all things greasy but this food was just nasty... it didn't even taste that unhealthy and it didn't really taste like anything but nasty dollar store cheese slices and gross 33 cent hot dog chili. I spit the first bite of my burger out because it was so gross, then I took the bun off and there was a short light hair in the chili. I told the waitress (Her name was Courtney) and she took it. I then told her I just wanted some chili fries instead and she informed me that they wouldn't be free. Well yeah, I know that, I didn't really expect them to be. I told her that's fine but to make sure we don't pay for the burger. That is when she went from being overly nice (so fake) to a complete bitch. She said \" Well of course you do... I mean its not our fault there was a hair in it.\" Yes, it is. It's exactly your fault. I told her I wasn't paying for a burger with hair in it and she argued with us for a while, then she took the burger to the bar and all the employees came out and loudly picked at it and tried to find the hair. They must have found it because she decided not to charge for the overpriced burger. The service and food was disgusting. I was scared to even eat my chili fries because they seemed like the type of people to spit in your food if you piss them off. It was gross anyway though and I ended up leaving most of it. I honestly can not believe this place is still in business.... You can only pay with cash. And there's only two non-alcoholic drink options... a glass bottle of coke and bottled water. You can't even get a glass of ice water. The website made this look like a lot of fun but the nasty food and terrible service ruin it. The nurse didn't even offer to spank us when we couldn't finish our food because she was pissed off at us.  Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas a short time ago to celebrate my niece's 21st birthday. After what I've seen about this place on TV, I knew that if I was anywhere near the place, I would give it a try. Well, I was, I did, and I loved it.    A word of warning, I ordered the triple-bypass, with bacon, before I knew how hard those waitresses spank you with the paddle! I was plenty motivated after seeing that, and finished all 1 //2+ pounds, and 6000 calories, without too much difficulty. Putting mustard on it at the end help cut through all that richness that I knew was making my gall bladder cry like a baby. The burger itself was quite good, and reasonably priced. I wish I could say I tried some of the other items on the menu, but the rest of my party enjoyed what they has as well (chili fries and drinks for the most part). Shots of alcohol come in prescription bottles with your name and 'directions for use' - a nice touch, and our 'nurse' was fantastic. Great service all-around.   Don't forget, cash only. The more people in your group, the more fun you'll have. People that are reserved, by nature, need not apply- the place is a bit of freak show. People that don't appreciate a little gluttony from time to time need not apply. Me and the rest of my group give it a thumbs-up."}
{"text":"This place is aces!!! Girls, don't be afraid to take your man here, even though the girls wear slutty nurses outfits they really take time to befriend the girls that come here!!! not to mention how hot is the doctor thing!!!! the burgers have good flavor and you got all the T and A you can handle... have fun!!! this place is great!!!!!"}
{"text":"definitely a different experience...they have a sign saying over 350 pounds eat free, the waitresses are dressed as naughty nurses and you get in a hospital gown before you eat....they promote obesity with high calorie burgers that they promote for having the most calories in a burger (world record)  Reviews play non-stop of tv interviews, exposes, etc. talking about how bad this place is for you and people have actually died in their restaurant eating their burgers...this is what kind of place it is.  Different for sure, but kind of disgusting and we couldn't even come close to eating the burgers-the punishment...taken to the center of the restaurant to get spanked...and as hard as the waitress can swing it, is as hard as you get hit-be prepared"}
{"text":"The burger and shake was pretty good, but DO NOT get the fries. Not good at all. Make sure and ask the Dr's or Nurse's to take pictures of you and your friends and make sure and get pictures of them. It was fun, everyone was very nice. Went on a Friday only had to wait about 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Two university friends and myself took upon ourselves to take a pit stop in Vegas to check out the American-core extravaganza of money and breasts. Well decided to get our debauched night started, we decided it would be fueled by the servings of the appropriate Heart Attack Grill.  We entered the shameless yet upfront calorie dispenser, passing a laughing overweight family trying out a cattle weight scale by the entrance. They dress you up as a hospital patient and a nurse (your server) sits you down in a loud cantina-like room where a dozen screens show news stories of clients suffering from health problems in relation to the restaurant itself. People are constantly eagerly peaking inside as if the restaurant was a monkey cage at a zoo. The mascot of the restaurant is doctor Mendele's reincarnation whose evil goals consist of giving you heart diseases.  We were given an overpriced menu with few items, including a vegan section which contained 100% organic cigarettes. A large statue of a nurse riding a cigarette is another celebration of tobacco in the establishment, and I, being a smoker, found both distasteful. Which brings me to the next point: the food.  We ordered a regular sized burger each by our large-breasted nurse with a hint of sadness in her eye, who then told us about the consequences of not finishing our meal: a public spanking in the middle of the restaurant. This happened 5 times while we ate with the whole restaurant cheering for the food waste. A morbidly obese man also got cheered for when he stepped on a scale and activated an alarm for being excessively heavy. He did not look cheerful however, although one gets to eat for free if above 350lbs.  We observed these scenes while waiting for our food, feeling increasingly uncomfortable from the desecration of weight problems, excessive machismo, and praising of tobacco and saturated fats, leading cause of the two literal biggest fatal diseases in the US, heart disease and cancer. I was already feeling sick when i got my food. This experience managed to convince me that fat is not correlated with tastefulness, as the large bun, patty, chili, and bacon all were as bland as the fries (separately bought). Interestingly, the most tasty ingredient was the tomato and onion in the burger. For the whole time i ate this entire meal I enjoyed myself at no single point.  Im not even proud I have visited this place. I'm embarrassed of myself and everyone who ate there that day.  I wish I could un-eat this meal. What we thought would be a unique counter cultural attraction revealed itself to be a sad reminder of contemporary problems in US society and people's attitudes toward them. This place advertises itself to be horrible and it is. They got that right."}
{"text":"This is a total novelty/tourist spot.  By all means, it's something to try out just for shits and giggs.  But it's not necessarily somewhere I'd lunch at on a weekly basis.    Upon walking in, my friend and I were directed to put on hospital gowns.  The restaurant requires that everyone puts one on.  Okay, that's cute, it has a theme...  Once seated, and continuing with the shtick, we were informed that they don't offer water, any diet beverages, or splenda/equal, etc. for iced tea.  I sort of get the diet soda but no water?  I foresee that being uncomfortable in the summer when it's really hot here.    My friend and I split the smallest hamburger and fries.  (We're two smaller chicks.)  The hamburger was decent, nothing special.  For the price, you can definitely find a better burger in this town.  The fries, however, were kinda gross.  In my opinion, fries fried in duck fat is simply unnatural and tasted funny.  I mean, I grew up eating certain foods fried in lard, particularly at my grandmother's house, so it's not exactly an unfamiliar taste.   Who knows, maybe I've grown conditioned to fries fried in certain types of oil.  The fries were also soggy.  I can't quite put my finger on the taste, but suffice it to say, I won't be ordering fries there again.  Would I go again? Meeh...probably not...maybe, just maybe, with OOT family or friends.  But there'd have to be A LOT of arm twisting.     Oh yeah, they only take cash (no credit/debit cards) and they don't validate Fremont Street parking."}
{"text":"A unique burger joint with a humorous experience. Didn't go for the food, went for the experience.  I walked in and grabbed a seat at the bar. The friendly head nurse gives you a admittance bracelet and dresses you in a hospital gown. There are creepy manequins standing around the restaurant. The head nurse told me she did shots off one of the guy surgeon manequins LOL.  A really hot waitress dressed in a super tight nurse costume showing lots of cleavage and lots of legs.  Small menu to choose from. As I don't eat beef, here is what I chose:  1.83 all you can eat fries... cooked in lard 4.55 30 oz butterfat strawberry shake.  The fries are usually fresh cooked and pretty good. The Shake,... it was very sweet, not the best thing I had but I enjoyed about 2/3 of it and then had to leave it because I was getting headache and dehydration.  I saw my man finish the quadruple bypass (four patties ewww). He got wheeled out to the car by the head nurse. His opinion: Very greasy, not the most flavorful.  Friendly service. The staff is all dressed up. and You're required to wear hospital gowns like a patient lol  There's entertaining stuff on the TV, stuff related to their restaurant. Local culture presented in a fun fashion.  This place is humorous, worth going to for the experience at least once...   but expect to crave some salad or some fruits/veggies afterwards cuz the grease/fat content will make you feel icky."}
{"text":"Loved the food and drinks! Yes it is not good for you, but once in a while is fine. You have to wear a gown with wait staff dressed as nurses. I had a double bypass and fries and fiancee had a single. Glad we finished them, did not feel like getting my butt whipped! LOL! Definitely worth a visit while in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Burgers are just ok. It was funny to watch my husband get spanked since he couldn't finish his meal. The concept is also cool just wish the food was a little better!"}
{"text":"I've heard about this place from friends and seen it on tv enough times for it to make it on my culinary bucket list. They absolutely delivered on committing to the theme. From hospital gowns and nurse-waitresses to alcoholic drinks administered via IV bags, pill bottles, and syringes, and sprinkled with the occasional spanking that turns heads, the atmosphere was lighthearted and fun. I've never felt more American in my gluttony than at this place. The food, though made to be overly fatty, was actually tasty. Good patty, great bun, taste was not sacrificed at all.  Aside from the food though, I loved the burger infused movie posters and famous works of art like Salvador Dali's \"burgers\" (not \"Clocks\") and the blasphemous \"Last Supper\" painting with Bible figures replaced with notable fast food icons.  Surprisingly funny and not at all what I thought came with the experience of the Heart Attack Grill was the anti-government sentiments. All in good fun, I'm sure. Obama pictures in the urinal and \"Obama's cut\" as the \"tax\" label on our receipt were knee-slapper moments. It was an experience I enjoyed, to say the least. Do it once. You'll be fine. Haha"}
{"text":"Burgers are actually pretty decent. I could only eat a single but I was stuffed after. Totally a \"one and done\" place for locals, but if friends come in to town ill take them here."}
{"text":"A bit overrated. Burgers are not too great either. Single burger definitely enough for most people."}
{"text":"Yes, as someone stated before, this place makes hooters look like a classy restaurant. You walk in, and the nurse tells you to sit wherever you want at this enormous awkwardly shaped table (a cross). I'm sure the owner or whoever designed it thought it was brilliant, but it was really awkward seating for our 6 person group. You sit on the outside of the cross, and the \"nurses\" work on the inside, taking orders/serving, etc. The inner lining of the cross also has mirrors, so you can check out your ugly nurses' asses from a variety of unflattering angles. And you end up staring and being stared at by other patrons of the restaurant, since you have to sit facing them.  The food is really disappointing. Seriously, you expect the food at HAG to be like a \"guilty pleasure,\" but for being that unhealthy, it has no flavor. Apparently, all they really intend is to clog your arteries, not to feed you something delicious. You can't justify putting that food in your mouth, because it tastes like soggy mush. Each patty is a half pound of unseasoned beef, cheese is optional. You have to go up and get your own tomatoes/onions/pickles (no lettuce), and also your own fries (which they charge extra for, and only put out in small batches, so you have to wait in line to get them since they run out so quickly). The fries, yes you would expect them to be delicious for being fried in lard, but no, they are soggy and gross. It was basically eating some disgusting potato and ketchup casserole. Oh, and all beverages come in a bottle, including water, which is another way for this cheap restaurant to charge you.   Our \"nurse\" (i.e. waitress) was also 40+ years old, and should not have been wearing that skimpy outfit, and the other nurse was too fat for her job. I guess they make the ugly nurses work during weekdays (jk..not really). The service was terrible too. Seriously, there was barely anyone there, and the nurses acted like they were busy doing something, and never tended to us or followed up with us. Like dumbas$es we still paid tip.  Anyway, go to hooters if you want better tasting food, better service, and better looking waitresses. I'm sure it's equally unhealthy, so don't feel bad. If you want burgers however, Red Robin has a tasty selection,, and their fries are absolutely delicious (and they bring them to you, so you're not standing in line like an a$$). Come to think of it, I think HAG stole their menu from In-N-Out. The burgers are the same, just bigger and flavorless. At In N Out, you can order a hamburger, a cheeseburger, a double-double, and then the \"secret menu\" of increasing cheeseburger sizes, and  which is exactly what HAG does.   Basically, the way HAG runs its restaurant is to cut corners. Make you serve yourself, while still bringing your food to you to collect tip. The huge table is easy to service, cuz hey, it's just one huge table. You're not really engaged in what is supposed to be an amazing and awesomely unhealthy experience to remember. Nothing is fun about being at HAG. They don't live up to the theme of the restaurant than say, 5&Diner where you get the feel that you're in a 50s diner. Oh, and the music sucks.  Bottom line, go to this restaurant if you want to clog your arteries. That's all you'll get out of your experience. That and regret."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here this evening for the experience. Well I have to say, our experience kinda sucked. The \"nurse\"  who was our waitress really wasn't into having fun it seemed. She was just take the order, and then we didn't see her again until she brought the food, and then not until she put the bill on our table. We wanted to have fun too. Its more hyped up than what it really is. They put you in a hospital gown and then I guess that is it.  I had the single bypass burger, My husband had the triple, we split the greasy fries, and split a chocolate butter shake, it made me throw up all night long. My husband was sick after eating there. I checked my pulse on the machine they have, and when i left it was 109. wow. so anyways the food was not to great, I have definitely had better. It really is just for if you want to say you did the experience. Nothing else, And I will not eat here ever again."}
{"text":"I heard so much about this place on TV and thought I'd give it a try. The location and ambience is really good but there was only one good looking waitress, the one who served us and she was too busy and ignored us. I don't really care about customer care anyway as I understand it might be frustrating for the waitresses to flirt with every one. When it comes to food, taste and quality of ingredients etc I really do care a lot.   The burgers they served were piece of crap, the bun was bad, the beef patty was dry and the grilled onions didn't taste like one.  They just put dry bun with dry patty and 6 slices of bacon and some grilled stuff and call it a burger. It doesn't get any better no matter how much mayo or mustard you put on it. I have had far better burgers at regular fast food chains like Carl's Jr, Smash burger, Five guys and even Mc Ds. This place is totally not worth the drive from the strip and the money.   THEY DON'T ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS!! so annoying.  Oh and the people who left 5 star ratings are either paid to write those reviews or their taste buds have completely gone by eating even crappier food."}
{"text":"This is the worst place ever disgusting burgers taste like the microwaved my burger!!!! I would rather eat school lunch then this burger place horrible WARNING DO NOT GO!!!!! Worst costumer service!!!! Very rude every one !!!"}
{"text":"All the marketing and hype can't disguise the fact that their food just isn't very good. In fact, it's really bad. It's a novelty restaurant that just can't deliver on what's most important for a restaurant: good food.  First: the good. The entire premise of Heart Attack Grill is to be as politically incorrect as possible. There's a blood pressure machine with a high score list. People over 350 lbs eat free. They don't serve salad. In fact, you can't even get lettuce on your burger. There are TV's all over the restaurant that just show the press coverage of Heart Attack Grill (this gets old real quick - I'd rather have the football game on). The waitresses are wearing sexy nurse outfits. But after the initial chuckle, you actually have to eat.  The bad: The food. The only palatable part of our meal was the Mexican Coke. Usually grease=good, except at Heart Attack Grill. I'm not sure how they did it, but they made a burger that's both greasy and dry. It's like they overcooked some beef and bacon, slapped it on a bun, and then used a mister to spray flavorless oil all over the burger. I tried to make it work. I really tried. I asked if they had any hot sauce, but they said no, you just have your choice of ketchup, mustard, and mayo. The fries tasted like they were just left in the fryer at low temperature. They came out greasy, limp, and without any flavor at all.  If you want a burger, go to any of the established burger joints in town: Fatburger, Five Guys, In n Out.  Even McDonald's makes a better burger than Heart Attack Grill."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I told the hostess I was uncomfortable wearing the hospital gown provided because of a recent hospital stay. She told us that I had to put it on or I could go away. Seriously. That's all it took for me to turn around and walk out. I will NEVER go back here."}
{"text":"I'd heard of this place & wanted to try it.  I live in LV so thought I'd get a burger to go from their Fremont street location.  There were 2 young ladies at the door, both dressed in those sexy nurse type outfits as were the waitresses there.  One of them took my order for the smallest burger they had, which by the time you add tax & tip it was over $10.  I don't remember seeing any other female customers, just a few tables of men dressed in hospital gowns.  There was no comfortable place to wait in front so I wandered around the place.  For a long time.  It was a long wait.  It was not a good burger.  None of it was.  Really false advertising for a place that hypes decadently delicious food.  Just now I checked their menu online (http://www.heartattackgrill.com/heart-attack-grill-menu.html) because I was trying to remember what I had paid.  Their website shows animated, scantily clad women doing things like humping a hotdog.  Another shows a woman who has been hogtied with bacon lying on her stomach and moving her boobs around as she tries to free herself.    The young ladies I met at the door seemed very nice and the service was good other then the long wait.  But the food is not good and let's face it - their target market is men (especially misogynistic men) who want to over eat and then j*rk off.    I'm just not in that demographic."}
{"text":"Tried to eat here on my last trip.  They have this gag that they think is hysterically funny (I would too...if I was 15.)  They make you dress up in a hospital gown and a hospital bracelet.  I never got to try the burger.  Once I hit the table, I doffed the gown so it was just around my waist.  It was itchy and smelled like it hadn't been washed since the last customer who wore it.  The waitress was a bitch, opening the conversation by spitting, \"Put your gown back on, hon!\"  I told her \"no\".  She said she wouldn't serve me without the dumb gown.  So I told her we were at an impasse.  Then I had to explain what an \"impasse\" was.  So, I left.  I ran into others on Freemont who had endured the unlaundered gowns (they said theirs smelled like someone else too) and they told me I didn't miss anything in their sub-par burger.  See, guys...Hooters gets to pull their gags because their food is actually good and their waitresses actually back off when you're not interested in being part of the show.    You're not Hooters.  Keep treating customers like this and you'll be just a Vegas memory."}
{"text":"This place IS REALLY COOL - the theme is 100% true - from the huge stethoscope hanging from the ceiling to the bottle of wine delivered in the IV-Stand, everything is true AND if you don't finish your hamburger you get the PADDLE (no kidding).  Too bad the quality of food is so poor that you can't even eat it (so everyone gets the paddle), especially the chili, which amounted to oozing grease from chunks of I don't know what.  I don't think anybody comes back here a second time.  If they would IMPROVE THE FOOD QUALITY I think this would be a really cool place to bring out of town guests, because the concept is great and totally belongs here in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty darn good. Its a cash only and the menu is pretty simple, burgers, dogs and fries. The burger reminded me of a backyard bbq and was pretty darn good. My boyfriend had the triple and a dog (he's got a large appetite) and couldn't quite finish it all.... but don't be mistaken, you will get spankings if you don't finish your food  !! The decor is pretty corny but it was a great time.  If your down with the grease and love a little entertainment Vegas style... this place is for you!"}
{"text":"The shock and awe of the atmosphere was awesome. Waitress was great. Food needs improvement. Bland and not great. Except the shakes, they were amazing! Will not return again as its something only worth doing once. But, will probably get a shake to go."}
{"text":"I rarely ever write bad reviews because I work in the industry and know how bad some places get hit with hecklers and bs comments but... Damn this place was Terrible! The worst burger in think I've ever had in my damn life. I know exactly what precook burgers taste like and I have a big feeling that's what these things are. It's gimmicky and I get that. You have to get people through the door somehow but please save yourself the money and lick the dirty hands of the nearest bum on the street. The service was decent and I rarely bother with commenting on service as it sometimes doesn't reflect the restaurant but it's the only thing it has going for it. The commercials playing on repeat, the crap art, and garbage food made me feel as if I were on a bad acid trip in hell. And nope I'm not being dramatic. Trust me this place is a waste of time and gas money."}
{"text":"I travel with a competitive speech team. We were recently in Arizona for a competition, and my team HAD to stop at the Heart Attack Grill- a member of my team is doing a speech about it, we couldn't get away without seeing the place firsthand!  Upon arrival, we were immediately greeted by a smell that can accurately be described as \"Fat, grease, and charred death.\" You know the smell that sometimes comes out of a burger restaurant- the slightly-singed, but otherwise-delicious smell of meat being grilled? This was a sick amplification of that. The smell alone was enough to drive several members of our party to pursue other options for dinner.  As far as decor, the restaurant does a good job of sticking to an anti-doctor theme, with signs plastered all over the restaurant warning you of the unhealthy nature of their food, mandatory patient gowns for all diners, and waitresses dressed as cute nurses.   But the food itself could be summed up with the word \"Sickening,\" which actually works metaphorically and literally. Their shakes are incredibly sweet, but actually filled with ice cream, pure cream, and butter. Their fries are cooked in lard, and their burgers are excessively heavy and fattening. A burger and fries is really enough to fill up a fully-grown man, but the sensation of being completely filled by lard, meat, and grease is almost as disgusting as seeing one of the obese regulars scarf down a triple-bypass burger for free.  The next morning, most of us who'd eaten there were still full. One of my friends said he \"felt like [he] just blew the Hamburglar.\" Starting with the smell, and lasting all the way to the aftertaste the next morning, this anti-hospital is as novel as it is grotesque and excessive. I seriously almost threw up twice before I even tried anything, but I like to exercise and eat healthy. Other people didn't seem as disturbed by the place as I did, and to HG's credit, the things they serve actually maintain a stronger semblance to edible food than some other places I've eaten. It will definitely fill you up, and the theme is kind of cute.  Nonetheless, I can't walk away from a restaurant feeling like I just destroyed my body and recommend it. I almost feel like the place is unethical for its  choice to give such flagrantly unhealthy meals. At the same time, the place is called HEART ATTACK Grill, and they don't make any effort to pretend they're doing anything other than providing the most unhealthy and disgusting food possible. With that, and the friendly service in mind, I can't justify any rating lower than 2/5. I'd definitely like this place more if they just used fresh ingredients, didn't cover everything in nastiness, and just stuck to making good burgers, fries, and shakes... but I realized that would just make them In-N-Out, and would kind of ruin everything this restaurant stands for.  Disgusting? Yes. Necessary? No. Immoral? Decidedly no, since they clearly warn you about what you're getting in to.  I'd eat here once, and NEVER again. It's a place fueled by novelty- go there only if you're inspired after watching Epic Meal Time on youtube."}
{"text":"Nice place full of people but the food is just really death on a plate I would love to eat there if I wasnt on a diet my friends loved it every bit so when I'm bit try watch my weight I'll wait there the huge scale was fun outside"}
{"text":"Are you #%¥#% kidding me. The staff's attitude is less than desirable. Must be working in the novelty of the name. Asked to speak with manager. Same problem. Good luck. Never going to this one."}
{"text":"Heart attack grill is a place where you should visit once and once only. It has an interesting hospital theme with fun burger posters hung along the wall. The servers are dressed up either as \"sexy nurses\" scrubs. The servers are fun and attentive and creates a great atmosphere for the guests to enjoy. The whole environment is the reason why hubby and I decided to try the place in the first place.   Now onto the food... You would think that a place where everything is deep fried in fat and butter would be good, but the hamburger patty is plain and dry, the chili is meh, the fries are over cooked.  The only thing I liked is probably my coke.  If you ever have the urge to try this place, I recommend going with a friend so you can split a single patty, enjoy the environment, then go somewhere else for better food."}
{"text":"This place was TERRIBLE!  Myself and a couple of friends made our way into the Heart Attack Grill very hungry after checking out a spring training game.  Everything was cool until we walked in the building and got a whiff of the grease filled air.  As we were entering the building one of the guys in the restaurant was getting wheeled out of the joint in a wheelchair after finishing their Quadruple Bypass Burger, the guy's face was full of regret as he was wheeled by us.  We finally sat down and each of us ordered a single-bypass (single patty burger), the thing that was delivered had some sort of a resemblance to a hamburger but I wasn't quite sure.  I took one bite and I thought I was going to throw up, it was like eating Crisco straight.  I tried my best to stomach more and at least get some of my money's worth but I had to quit after the third bite.  The two redeeming qualities about the place, if at all, was that 1) the girls working that day were pretty cute and 2) they serve bottled Coke that uses real sugar.  Other than that there is absolutely no reason to eat at this place since there are other places that serve way better burgers for half the price or that have better looking girls with a lot less clothing on (Hooters)."}
{"text":"My boyfriend really wanted to go here because of he thought the theme was cool and that it would be fun. Well it turned out to be the opposite. Yes it was funny to sit in a hospital gown, but unless you were there for jello shots and hard core drinking, the waitresses wouldn't pay any attention to you. It took us 15 minutes to get our drink order and then longer to get our actual order. I just got a single burger and fries and let me tell you after eating that \"food\" i wanted to vomit.   The fries were rock hard and not good at all for something fried in lard. The burger might have been okay if the chili wasn't on it because it tasted like powdered chili (aka vomit). Definitely not quality food and they make their money off the atmosphere. I couldn't  even finish my food, so my boyfriend had so shove it down so I didn't get spanked. But we COULD NOT finish those gross fries. Didn't get a spanking because it was clear how upset we were. As the slow service theme continued to get our check, we walked out of there with that burger sitting in our stomach's for hours."}
{"text":"Went in the other day for the first time, sat down at the bar and a fat bald guy started pressuring that we needed to order! I had been sat down for all of 30 seconds and just gotten the menu. He was persistent and I ask him if there was a time limit and he just starred at me with a stupid look on his face so I decided to leave. I told the hostess on the way out that he needed to learn some manners & customer service skills to which she replied; he's the owner!!!!! Enough said, I won't be going there again...........................  From most of the reviews here I would say if you want to eat crap just go to that other place with the clown, super size it and save yourself 30 bucks!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a milk shake to go. What? Cash only? You don't take debit cards? What year is this? I thought this was a real restaurant. You lost this local's business."}
{"text":"I was just in Vegas this past weekend, and a friend and I were checking out some stuff north of the strip.  It was lunch time, we were hungry and right near Freemont Street.  We saw the signs for Heart Attack Grille and thought it sounded like a fun place with a good burger.  But, first, we decided to check it out on Yelp just to be sure we weren't making a huge mistake.  \"Just 2 stars.\" . . . \"Let's try it anyways - looks cool.\"  It could have been the pretty girls in the mini nurses uniforms, that tipped the decision their way, but I'm glad we went.  The burgers were good, not great, but good.  The single is plently big enough and has like 5 - 6 pieces of Bacon.  Good, crispy bacon.  Servers were cute, friendly and polite.  My friend found a hair in her burger, they took care of it immediately.  Their chocolate shake was super rich - had a pad of butter on the top.  I wasn't sure if I should be grossed out or find it funny - I decided on funny.  This is really probably more of a 3 star place, but since there are so many other negative reviews, I'm giving them a 4th to help them out.  Don't go here if you are looking for a gourmet meal, great service, or a widely varied menu.  There are soooooo many great restaurants in Vegas for that kind of stuff.  Go here if you are just looking for a fun place with a funny concept.  Think of it like Hooters but with only really big burgers with ton's of bacon."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Amazing Service! Great value for money. Enough food to fill you up for an entire month!   They really mean what the say - you defiantly feel like your gonna have a heart attack - the heart burn was defiantly not unexpected.   Amazing theme! Getting everyone dressed up in hospital gowns! Defiantly a bonus if your a messy eater.   Just a pointer for anyone new visiting there - order small!! You can always order more! Cause if you cannot eat it all your waitress spanks you with a wooden paddle."}
{"text":"Disgusting food I wouldn't even feed the livestock on my pig farm.  It's not that it's unhealthy - there are plenty of unhealthy places that serve tasty food - it's that it's downright low quality as well, and cooked in such a way to induce vomit.  It makes McDonalds look like a gourmet room."}
{"text":"Women are hot! Beer is cold and burger are on the money!!!!! What more do you want from a burger joint. Excellent place to go to if you are on a trip to Vegas with just the fellas. Eat all your food or face the consequences."}
{"text":"While I did expect the price to be a bit on the high side considering it is in the heart (no pun intended) of Downtown Las Vegas, I was not expecting it to be as overpriced as it is.   The employees seemed to be simply going through the motions and did not really appear that they wanted to be there.   As for the food, the burger was not only overpriced, but overcooked as well. I don't mind a burger that is well done, even though I prefer medium, but I did not expect to have a burger that was like shoe-leather. The bun was twice as big as the burger, so I tore half the bun from the burger and it fit the burger properly. The bacon was only half cooked, maybe to even out the overcooked burger? The onions were the only part of the burger that was properly done. the tomato was so small it seemed more like a cherry tomato than a burger size tomato. There was supposed to be cheese on the burger, but I had a difficult time finding it, a single small bite was all I got with cheese.  As for the fries, all I can say is there is nothing worse than cold, soggy fries with zero taste.   This is one local that won't be returning."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  When I first heard of this place, I wanted to drive to Arizona and experience it.  I finally got to try it now that it is located in Vegas and I was so disappointed. The theme is awesome. Too bad the food is not.    To the owner: Please make the food taste good.  You have a brilliant idea for a restaurant in the perfect city."}
{"text":"I usually rate restaurants based on their food.....  The burger at Heart Attack grill is not that good....you would think that a place that has only a burger and hot dog would find some time to perfect these, but this place seems to be more about it's overall concept than the food.  I got the single burger and regular fries.....I did add bacon.  The burger was really tiny, the bun completely dwarfed it.  There was an inch radius between the burger and the edge of the bun.  The red onion on it was cut way too thick, so every time you bit into the burger, it tasted very strong of onion (I love onion btw...so the onion has to be super strong for me to make this comment).  The fries were old and cold....they  had to be sitting out for at least 30 minutes to have that consistency and temp.  The chili on the burger looked like baby poop.......the best thing on the table was my bottle of water.  With so many good restaurants in Vegas.....this one should be avoided.  Unless your thing is getting spanked by a waitress in a nurse's outfit.  (one of their concepts is you get spanked with a paddle (aka Dazed and Confused) if you don't finish your food."}
{"text":"I just walked by and saw this restaurant.  I had to go in and try the burgers.  I got the burger with 4 patties and 25 leaves of bacon - holy S###.  The burger was a way bigger then I expected but it killed it in order to save my ass !!   Quality of the burger - good - toppings fresh. Patties tasted well, bacon too.  Nice service staff"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! But, I do have a couple concerns (hence the four stars).  This establishment discriminates against skinny people! I only weigh a buck fifty and I got laughed at by the staff when I walked in.  The food however is wonderful! Real lard, real pad of butter on milkshakes, and hot servers doesn't hurt.I should probably eat here more often so I can gain weight and earn the respect from the staff. Because I care about what people think of me. I wanna be fat damnit!!!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe the negative reviews on this place! I disagree completely.  My boyfriend and I thought it was awesome. We went last month for the first time and he ordered a single burger with fries and a beer. I ordered fries and a butterfat shake. We both loved our food. And honestly, because I am a huge milkshake fan, I love to try new ones and this was by far the best shake I've had in a very long time. (chocolate) So thick and creamy and delicious! (must be all the fat haha) Fries were great but I did have to add a little more salt which was not a problem, my boyfriend said his burger was awesome and cooked just right. When going to this restaurant, you know you are in for a fatty, greasy, salty time and that's what you should expect.  The nurse outfits were cute, the aprons they put on you were so fun, the whole experience of this place was like no other. We DEFINITELY recommend trying heart attack grill! It was really fun, tasty, and our waitress was awesome too. :)"}
{"text":"Fun, kitschy place to go for a humorous lunch while in downtown Vegas. Loved the over the top concept of the place. Friendly waitresses, cheery atmosphere and great burger and fries to boot. The best was the strawberry shake, absolutely delish."}
{"text":"Love the hot dog best smothered with chili! But the 8 way burger is the bomb , I killed that thing!!!! Recommend when visiting Las Vegas you stop here first, quite the experience!"}
{"text":"sexy nurses, shots of alcohol in a pill bottle, spankings for not finishing your food.  whats not to love.  come prepared to leave feeling full and bloated.  but it is Vegas baby live a little"}
{"text":"Sind hierher gekommen, da wir das Heart Attack aus dem TV kennen. Coole Idee mit den Outfits der Krankenschwestern/Kellnerinnen und den Patienten/Gäste...jedoch war es innen ein wenig enttäuschend, hätten mehr erwartet, so ganz sauber war es auch nicht, wirkte etwas schmuddelig, hatten schon besseres gesehen...der Service war jedoch sehr freundlich. Dann haben wir Single und double bypass burger bestellt, hat uns beide jedoch geschmacklich nicht umgehauen, haben schon bessere burger gegessen. Alles in allem: war nur \"ok\", aber einmal hin hat ausgereicht!"}
{"text":"This place is just weird. They force you to wear a hospital gown.. they claim it is clean I don't know about that.  The food is nasty! The burgers are dry how can a chiliburger be dry?? I have no idea they accomplished it though. Their fries are gross we made the mistake of ordering the chili fries. The table wasn't clean, the server had a hard time getting the order correct even though there are only like 4 food options. They only accept cash, their drink selection is extremely limited. So to some it up over priced for the quality and what it is, bad service, dirty, inconvenient... And 3 members of my group got food poisoning a few hours later... GROSS I'd  rather eat McDonald's."}
{"text":"If you're going to put on a show about being the place where the food is worth dying for, you would expect the food to be great. Unfortunately, the Single Bypass burger I had was dry and bland, the fries were ok, but not great. The butterfat shake came in a plastic glass, maybe about a 16 oz. size. It gave me indigestion. If there is a next time, I'll get the real Coke instead.  If the food was as good as Fatburger's, it would be worth the trip, but it is hard to live up to the concept, I guess. Even Johnny Rocket's would be better for a burger/fries/shake meal.  As for the hot waitresses, the ones on duty were only average, and the mannequins on display were far hotter."}
{"text":"The food was decently priced, the portions were crazy huge!!! My hubby got a hot dog... **that was funny to watch him eat** I had a liquid dinner which consisted of a pill jar full of rum with my name on it [came with a great slushie] 2 jello shots that were in syringes... i stole fries from my mother in law and a piece of her burger. i wasn't too fond of the bacon... and that is always a deal breaker for me **i'm a hardcore bacon addict.**  oh!!!!!!!!!! they have spanking sessions there && make you wear a gown. lol."}
{"text":"Thank you Madeline for the best dining experience ever. The food was great, you were better. You are one awesome chick. Keep the good vibes flowin. Love ur rack!"}
{"text":"Okay, yes it is gimmicky, touristy, and completely over the top, but it was fun and the burger was delicious!  I guess I could take or leave the fires cooked in lard, as far as I could tell they weren't really any better or worse than the peanut oil cooked fries at Five Guys, but I enjoyed them enough.  I didn't go for the milk shake with a stick of butter in it, that seemed gross, but I did enjoy some nice trashy PBR while I was there.  The only reason I'm not going to give five stars is because of the beer.  Cans only, and of the most trashy brands imaginable, which is of course keeping with the theme but I would have much enjoyed a good IPA or stout as opposed to Colt 45."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is good for a shock value and its a real nice counter-point to all those vegan-healthy places out there. If you take pride in obesity or wish to die from a hamburger induced heart attack. This is the place for you!  It tastes good but, it leaves you feeling glutinous I've had their small burger and fries. I felt disgusted with myself and didn't feel like eating much for the next couple of days.   If you're a health nut/vegan then this place is a living hell and you need to run far far away. This place is quite possibly the worst place you'd want to be if you are.  The decor is decent, The prices... Not so much. No false advertising here.   I feel kinda gross just typing this but, it is what it says it is and I can't fault them for that."}
{"text":"As it turns out, just because food is incredibly bad for you doesn't mean it's tasty! We had the flat liner Fries with chili and cheese and they just weren't good. I think there shakes are full of butter which seems fun until yourealise it just tastes like butter, which is good on toast but not so good in a thick shake. I think I thought the taste would make up for the calories but I was wrong... Staff seemed nice. It's a pretty funny and irreverent restaurant but maybe the burgers are better than what we ordered."}
{"text":"Service - Great Atmosphere - Fun and unique, you'll never forget your experience here  Food - Good Value - worth every penny  You'll never experience anything like this place, don't miss this restaurant on your trip to Vegas !"}
{"text":"This place is super gimmicky. That being said, it is certainly a fun place to visit, and fits into Vegas perfectly. We sat at the bar, and the service was actually awesome. All of the servers, or rather nurses, were helpful, and answered our questions about the food, the paddling (if you don't finish) etc. I really wanted to give this place five stars for the atmosphere and service, but the food was really meh. If you are looking for a fun and bizarre place to go with friends and family, definitely go. If you are looking for a delicious burger, go to In-and-Out.  Probably the strangest part about the place is that one of their daily customers actually died of a heart attack and they proudly display his ashes above the bar. That's dedication."}
{"text":"Nourriture vraiment pas terrible mais très bonne ambiance... On vous enfile une blouse de patient d hôpital des l arrivée et les serveuses sont des jolies infirmières  qui n'hésiterons pas a vous mettre la fessée si vous ne finissez pas votre assiette. Les Burgers sont conçus pour être les plus gras possible..."}
{"text":"I get it... it's the HEART ATTACK Grill however the burgers are disgustingly greasy.  I love a good burger but one drenched in a pool of grease? I think not. Dressing in hospital gowns was unique and seemed fun until I realized people were getting an intense spanking with a wooden paddle for not finishing their food.  I had a bite of the \"single bypass burger\" and called it quits. Never again."}
{"text":"I'm a local. I've passed over this place many a time laughing at the gimmickry involved in keeping this place open. It's so absurd as a concept that it's entertaining. In earnest, when my father told me this was where we were eating that day for lunch, I began to talk him out of it. But it was his day and I suspect he was going for the nursing outfits.  To start with, you're required to keep on the hospital gowns. It's a cute gimmick but annoying when you're wearing a sweater. The menu is unsurprisingly limited. Giant hot dogs or build your size burger with fried sides. The prices are inexplicably high unless you want to add unnecessary amounts of bacon. For some reason, adding bacon costs about a buck.  The beer selection is a choice of three overpriced cans. Or you can go for soda or the gimmick IV alcohol or Jell-O shot syringe to name a few.   A highlight is the overall gimmick in itself. The movie poster adaptations are interesting scenery. The homemade music video interpretations are both fascinating and disturbing. The nurses are cute in their skimpy costumes, but there are plenty of restaurants in Vegas with barely clad girls and tasty food.  And that brings us to the heart of the review: the food. The single bypass burger was not just incredibly unhealthy (as advertised) but genuinely terrible. It wasn't just sautéed in lard; it was brutalized by it. It was so overdone I complained to the waitress. Her response was, \"if you don't finish, you get spanked.\" I attempted to explain that parts of the patty were burnt and she eventually replaced it with something eerily similar. This was definitely not \"a burger worth dying for.\" It's not even a burger worth paying for. The onion rings and fries were plentiful, but again, generally terrible. I get the gimmick of wanting to pack calories into each meal. But doing so to sacrifice flavor goes against the entire purpose of a restaurant. You can do high calorie artery clogging decedent food that tastes good.    Heart attack grill's problem is that it is more money making gimmick than restaurant. It's the culinary equivalent of cow tipping."}
{"text":"This is one of the many restaurants in Vegas you go to for the experience. Do not go for the food trust me. The food left a lot to be desired. The only thing I really enjoyed was the atmosphere and the server was nice to! Overall decent restaurant would I come back probably not."}
{"text":"Horrible food, bland no flavor, if you go for the experience that's not even worth it, just get the single burger and don't waste your money. First Time I came and the last time I'll come. Everything about a cheesy restaurant is this restaurant, and when the customers get spanked the nurses really fuck you up. Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"Have been in Vegas for a few  months working and we have been trying Burger joints all over town. Skip the strip and come down to Fremont street and try them here. You do not have to be drunk you just need to love burgers and you will not be disappointed here. They serve burgers with a smile."}
{"text":"Just like it sounds. Good food and a tourist attraction for those visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"The one star is for the experience only.  The food warrants a negative rating.  The only way to sum up the Heart Attach Grill is kitschy, but fun.  Unfortunately, their food doesn't live up to their slogan of \"taste worth dying for.\"  We came in expecting good food, but not gourmet.  Worst burger and fries we had ever tasted.  To start, the burgers were chard to a wonderfully grey color. I think they were as well done as leather.  They lacked seasoning and the bacon was as chewy as they precooked stuff found in the back of a supermarket.  Lard fries should be crisp and delicious, full of flavors not found at fast food or your normal burger stops. No.  They were boiled in lard, soggy and mushy, and, like the burger, lacked any seasoning and flavor.  I would have preferred to eat at a McDonald's.  People giving this place anything over 2 stars need to reevaluate what they consider to be a good burger, because better food can be had at a \"roach coach\"."}
{"text":"This place is so thorough with their theme, it screams for a 5 star review.  From the from the \"bibs\", table-tops, the fake movie posters, the tape loop on the video screens (hint: search for this restaurant on YouTube), to the costumes, this place totally nails it.  The funny thing is, the fries are actually really, really good having been cooked in lard.  That and I've never, ever, ever seen a restaurant actually serve a Hamm's tallboy.  When Penn and Teller had their show on Showtime, Penn said something to the effect that freedom is debauchery with a smile. Amen. Viva Las Vegas. God bless America. This kind of thing wouldn't be around anywhere else."}
{"text":"It is a themed restaurant and NO WHERE near gourmet food quality.  It is good for laughs but don't be in a hurry they are SLOW........... and they make you pay with cash but take orders on iPhones. WTF get a square and make it easy on your customers.  If over 350 you eat for free. Otherwise yuppy ate paying for the decor and theme.  If you want a unique theme and plenty of pics then this is your place"}
{"text":"enjoyable. I didnt like wearing that stupid robe thingy but I enjoyed their food the only thing is that they only accept cash which I found to be really inconveinent."}
{"text":"Best thing ever!!! I had to go here while in Vegas and let me tell you it was a blast. Fun from the time we walked in. I can't wait to go back on the return trip."}
{"text":"First real food stop here in Vegas after being up nearly 24 hours. I am in Vegas for the Mr. Olympia expo and after seeing all the healthy fit people one of the people in our group wanted to eat at this fattening restaurant. I had never been here, but was very hungry after walking all day, and being off my diet for over 8 months. Great way to celebrate with this high calorie restaurant.   The first thing you notice in front of the restaurant is a scale...yes to weigh yourself. Apparently they promote being oversized, since all those over 350 lbs. eat free!! Our whole group weighed ourselves just to see how much we would weigh after eating here. Upon entering we were greeted by nurses and given a hospital patient gown. It was the best how very themed the restaurant was getting all customers into their world. This created a wonderful atmosphere for us to lose ourselves and enjoy the moment. They are known for the highest calorie burger with the quadruple bypass burger. It has 4 1/2lb. patties with cheese chili, onion tomato and pickles. Basically also everything is cooked in lard to raise the calories even more! The burger alone was 8000 calories. I added fries also cooked in lard, so who knows how much more calories that added! I also got a strawberry daiquiri that came with a personalized prescription bottle with your name printed on it. The bottle was 3.4 oz of a shot of alcohol. This was a heavy, high calorie meal that I ate completely but felt guilty and shame at the same time.   Everything tasted good, but it was all about the experience of the restaurant and how the theme of it enthralls you while eating there. If you don't manage to finish your burger, you will get spanked. Yes, spanked by one of the nurses with a wooden paddle. Very funny to see when it happened. I would come back here again, but only with friends. The reason why is to enjoy the experience. I didn't think the food was all that great, but still good.   I would recommend this place to all first timers and all those who love burgers. I'm really giving it 3 stars for the food, and the extra star for the theme given at the restaurant. Hope this helps you decide."}
{"text":"We went here after a night of drinking and gambling on Freemont. I found it hilarious and we had a great time. I love the shots in prescription bottles. Nurse waitresses and grown men getting spanked. The food was super greasy but what did you expect? Go here for a greasy burger and a good time."}
{"text":"The service, quality, and taste of this place is about as bad as it is for your health. Not to mention that the owner treated me completely awful recently. Never will I ever go back to this death trap. Save myself the 8 bucks and go to 24 Carrots Juice across the street."}
{"text":"It's ok but it's just good for entertainment and pictures. If you do not finish your food  you can get a very big spanking which scared me... lol  because I cannot finish the food very large portions.."}
{"text":"This place was GREAT! My boyfriend and I were \"admitted\" to the \"hospital\"  with an IV bracelet and we were dressed in patient gowns for the duration of our meal. Our waitress was great and was very nice about taking our picture.  The food was great. My boyfriend loved his lard sauteed bun and the burger was tender and juicy. The fries were of course, fried in lard, and I went back for THIRDS because they are unlimited. We tried not to think about the calories and enjoyed our meal.  I talked to the owner - the guy they interview on TV. He was a really nice guy, surprisingly. I asked him if he really was a nutritionist and he said \"Yes, and I still have a practice. I believe this is the best way to live. You have to have a cheat meal once a week. Don't eat here everyday, it's bad for you. But without a cheat meal, you'll drive yourself crazy.\" I was a little star struck (I don't get out much) so I didn't ask anymore questions. I was happy that I got to meet him!  The reviews about \"cottage cheese thighs\" and this place being a Hooters knock off are, in my opinion, a little far fetched. I think if you've seen the specials they have on TV about this place you pretty much know what you're in for. I thought it was great that the waitresses were dressed as nurses, and of course they aren't perfect. Perfect models don't have time to work in fast food! These are just real women making a living off their looks and having a good time. Besides, I'm sure they make bank in tips from all the fatties that really do go there to gorge themselves on a daily basis (if you're over 350 pounds you can eat for free).   All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by the restaurant, happy that I got to talk to the owner/founder, and was treated well by the staff. The food was good, the atmosphere was fun. I recommend if you are vacationing in Arizona, check this place out!"}
{"text":"If I can give this place no stars I would it's disgusting burgers taste like microwaved meat horrible do t waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Better than what my expectation was of the place.  The entertainment factor is better than the food.  Food Hedonism at its finest for Vegas."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this HAG location twice.  Each time, the wait staff were attentive and responsive.  It's a limited menu - but portions are substantial.  The fries are above average and I rate the shakes as O.K.  It detracts from the shakes that they are served in cheap plastic cups.  I thought the burger was good - with a fresh bun, good meat and garnishes.  Even the minimal single burger is big, my wife could only eat half of her burger.  The shtick involved with the whole faux medical thing is cheesy but tolerable.  It was kind of fun watching others get spanked and teased by HAG staff."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Worse customer service I've ever had. It may have just been my waitress. However customer service should be number one & I won't ever go here again due to the service. Plus the food is nasty which play another factor on how horrible this restaurant is."}
{"text":"Firstly, this review is an experience, and is not rated solely on just the food.  We arrived and were greeted by the nurse who told us to gown up. This was so amusing because I work in the health care field. We were seated and given a menu. The menu is hysterical because there are no diet drinks, instead their are foods which are given the common stereotype as \"give you a heart attack\" such as liquor shots in prescription bottles, energy drinks, huge fatty foods, alcohol in IV bags with your custom prescription name on it.  The rules are that if you weigh more than 350 lbs, your meal is free. They actually have a scale. You also have to finish your meal, and if you fail to do so, the nurse will spank you.. literally. And you cannot split your meal with someone. I went ahead and ordered a double bypass with the works. The food itself is pretty good, but nothing to write home about. It's just a regular, meaty burger you can find at most burger joints. But, don't let that discourage you, the place itself holds a solid theme and I believe that speak louder for the food itself. Again, it's all about the experience.   Everyone in our party finished their meal, but I insisted for the nurse to spank me. What they have you do is bend you over and grab the handle bars. There is a camera facing towards your face which broadcasts your reaction to the TV all over the restauraunt. I'm being complete serious when I say this, but I feel that these nurses enjoy their work and really whale down on you. These girls slapped me so hard, that I had to call it quits. It really hurt. I'm a tan guy, and I walked away red as an apple with blood shot eyes. Perhaps it was the fact that I tried to be kinky and insisted that the nurse assault me that caused them to really unleash it.  Needless to say, the experience was fun for everyone. Our nurse was extremely friendly, and intuitive. We came a little bit after opening, so it wasn't too busy and Rikki, our nurse, sat with us and chatted a bit and told us about herself and the background of the restauraunt.  I recommend coming here and would return if given the opportunity"}
{"text":"Airways wanted to try this place being the health freak that I am not. Well greeted and dressed in a patent gown before going to my table. Offer of menu explanation, but I had done my research and so ordered a single bypass with bacon, and a portion of fries.- I did not realize the spanking was voluntary so wanted to make sure I finished! The staff were brilliant and friendly, and even though it was only 4 on a Monday afternoon, the place got lively. The burger was good, filling and tasty, but the fries were a little bland considering what they are cooked in. Saw some brave men and a woman get the paddle which brought tears to my eyes- certainly not for the feint bottomed.! Summary, great staff, great service, great burgers and great fun. So if you are on the strip, take a taxi, or better still take the Deuce bus which drops you off 200m from the place and the pick up back to the strip is just outside."}
{"text":"My one star giving to this place goes only to the waitress that served us on our visit. My wife, in-laws and I stopped by for lunch last week and were very disappointed in this place. We placed our order with the waitress who was kind and very fast with our drink and food orders. One of the orders was the half pound hot dog, looked amazing but the hot dog was cool to the touch. No big deal just have it heated up a bit and its good to go right? We sent it back and the gutless manager in back tells the waitress to tell us that its hot enough and if we want a new one we have to buy a whole new hot dog... 9$ for a hot dog and you cant even serve it hot?? Wow and a real manager would come deal with a problem in person. Not send the employees to pass their rude messages. Poor excuse for management and even the waitress agreed that it was the worst management shes ever worked for. She also told the waitress that 70 was hot enough for a hotdog???  Are you kidding me? Take a class on food preparation and then a people skills class. Not sure who was manager on duty 10-16-13 around 2pm but they should stop being so lazy and make sure all food is served hot not 70 degrees."}
{"text":"The Year is 1993:  Hernan N. comes home from school and turns on the TV.On comes one of the greatest animated shows of all time, Animaniacs.The 10-year old me follows the adventures of Yakko, Wakko and Dot(plus various other characters.Pinky & The Brain!The Goodfeathers!) everyday with delight.  Right now you are probably thinking to yourself, \"Why the fuck is this guy talking about cartoons?\"  There was a nameless character on the show who just happened to be a buxom blonde nurse.Whenever Yakko would come across said nurse he would shout out his catchphrase, \"HELLOOOOO NURSE!\"  That began my obsession/fetish/whatever with girls in nurses outfits.I'm not talking about those lame scrubs that nurses wear nowadays(screw you male nurses for ruining the way that nurses dress now), but the white outfits and hat little white hat with the red cross on it.To this day, whenever I come across an attractive woman that phrase echoes through my head.I sometimes find myself imagining what a girl will look like in a nurse's outfit before deciding to approach her.Relationships have been ruined due to this obsession(why aren't more women into roleplaying?).Anyway...  The Present:  I find out there is a new restaurant opening up on Fremont Street that serves frighteningly unhealthy food and the waitresses are dressed like nurses....I'm there, dude.  I walk in and the 1st thing I see is a short, busty blonde dressed as a nurse.With every fiber of my being I fight off the urge to yell out, \"HELLOOOO NURSE!\"  She puts a hospital gown on me and I am seated at the bar, attended to by a lady wearing surgeon scrubs.The menu says. \"Taste worth dying for.\"  I didn't feel like going overboard for my 1st time, so I ordered the Single Bypass(1/2 lb burger), Lard Fries(wtf!?) and a Coke.While I waited on my food I chatted up the bartender and asked her how often 350+ lbs people come to get a free burger.She told me at least 1 a day, and one night there was 6.Minutes after I inquired, a hefty fellow came in and got on the scale.This contender stood at 6'5 and weighed in at 357 lbs.America, fuck ya.  The fries were pretty damn good.I have no clue what lard is supposed to taste like but it works well with fries.Apparently, the bun and meat of the burger are also coated with lard.Lardopalooza up in here.  Something about this burger was just not right.The cheese looked like it had been placed onto the burger the moment it had been handed to me, the onions had the texture of worms(Yes, I've eaten worms before.)Normally when one bites into a really good burger, you get that burst of flavor in your mouth that makes you pity vegetarians.I did not experience that here.  As I continued to eat, I gazed up at the video wall and saw the sign(Throwing out an Ace of Base reference).The video shows the owner in a doctor's outfit and two nurses shopping for supplies at a Sam's Club/Costco warehouse store.He pushes the 2 nurses around on a cart and comes to the meat section.Now it all makes sense.They buy all their product from a fucking Costco!sigh...  I wanted to like this place, i really did.The staff is great, the theme and atmosphere is cool but the food is just not good."}
{"text":"A lot has changed at this place in the 18 months since my first visit when I loved this place.  The sexy costumes are GONE,   the PBR on ice is GONE,  the \"A Team\" of cute and entertaining waitresses is gone.    The last two times I went there for lunch I was greeted with grenades and boring beers.  Not worth the extra cost and calories anymore.   For what ever reason this place has lost its MOJO."}
{"text":"Not sure what to expect really.. But it was probably the best experience I've had at any restaurant.. It was both ridiculous and hilarious at the same time, not what you could ever imagine. A unique experience that should be experienced at least once in your life. You don't come here for the food.. It's the unique experience! The staff are super friendly, very informal but genuinely nice. I recommend this place to anyone who visits Las Vegas!! It has such a lovely atmosphere and interesting yet funny things to be entertained by from the menu, to the drinks, the artworks on the wall, the receipt printout, and many more! They really have used their imagination well. Toilets are clean as well. No credit cards, only cash accepted."}
{"text":"Hilarious environment and honest menu labels.  The milk shakes are incredible!"}
{"text":"Nice concept and all but the food is horrible.  Not that its not healthy, its BLUNT. If its not healthy anymore it might as well taste good, right?"}
{"text":"Wow!  Are there no reviews of this place, yet?  Okay, this is a funky, fun concept for a restaurant.  First of all I need to let you all know the food is great, although one might not want to eat it every day.  The menu fits on one business card, so the choices are simple. Nothing is diet at all, and the french fires are fired in lard.  BUT, the food is soooo good.  The concept is cute too.  The cooks are dressed as doctors, and the waitresses are dressed as nurses a la Tim Curry as he was dressed in the Rocky Horror Picture Show.  It sounds weird, but I recommend everyone who loves a great burger try the Heart Attack Grill in Phoenix.  Get thee there!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money or time. Burgers were the worst I ever had and the atmosphere was just as bad. If your drunk and looking for a weird time, this might be for you"}
{"text":"Sad that on my brothers last night in Vegas, we got turned away an hour before closing because they only had 2 servers working. That sucks. It was on my things to do list because this was my first time in Vegas. Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Great and fun environment. The hamburgers and fries very tasteful. The vodka in a medicine bottle prescriptive to us. lol Clean and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Get on board with their gimmick and you'll have a fun time! Be prepared, there are windows all around so people will definitly look in and stare at everyone inside.   Fun experience - you have to wear a wristband and hospital gown. Your server is a sexy nurse and she will warn you that you will get spanked if you don't finish your burger. Food is ok - everyone is cooked in lard so it's tasty going down. Our group ordered burgers, fries, and candy cigarettes. No spanking for us but it's hilarious to watch the men get spanked. The nurses spank them really hard - it's funny to see who yelps in pain and who just takes it. It looks like they don't spank women - the woman at the table next to us couldn't finish her burger and our waitress assured her she wouldn't get spanked but her husband would have to take it for her!  If you weigh over 350 lbs, your burger is free, you just have to get on the massive scale to prove it.   We were there on a Friday night around 10 pm, it was lacking in ambience, I think it would have helped to have some upbeat music pumping in. It's definitely one of those places to try once and take pictures - bring cash, it's cash only."}
{"text":"This was the second food adventure I had while visiting AZ for the past weekend with my friends.  I'm not that big into burgers, but I had to try this place ever since I've seen it on the Travel Channel.  I was a little scared since this place cooks everything in LARD, but when in Rome...  This place gets a 2 stars for a couple of reasons.  First, the burger I had wasn't that great.  It tasted like a back yard bbq session.  I was expecting a little bit more.  Second, after we got done eating my other friends felt like crap the whole day.  I believe they spent some time with the porcelain seat back at our hotel...  The only thing that saved this place from the 1 star is the Fries and the Shakes.  The fries are pretty good and its bottomless.  Maybe it was the LARD it was cooked in but the fries had a unique taste.  The Vanilla Shake I had was good.  My friends had the Strawberry Shake and can attest to its goodness as well.  The best part of the Heart Attack Grill is........THE NURSES!  If it wasn't for them, I would have walked out of this place as soon as I bit into my burger.  Good Gimmick bad burger!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food, not as suitable for young children as people get the paddle  and this event takes place in the middle of the floor--could be the wrong message for younger eyes. Overall staff was nice and the food was good."}
{"text":"Ok, so..... I expected to come here and eat the food with the understanding that it was going to be lardy and fatty.  I will admit, the shake was really good, and the fries were also alright..... but the burger..... UGH  I ate 2 single burgers (I got to eat for free since I'm a big guy).  They sat in my gut, like a hot wet towel. I was not impressed nor was I feeling good after this.  Yep, the hot nurses make up for it.  Nope, I will not be going back, one time experience.  Yep, I'm glad I experienced this once in my life.  Oh yeah, and it's cash only. No credit cards."}
{"text":"Should have listened to the yelp reviews but my boy wanted to go here since he saw this place open last time. this place was dead when we got there.. at dinner time.. I was expecting some food eating challenge get a t-shirt thing which I'm down for but no.. just a bunch of gross food and spanking if you Don't eat it all. So basically you just don't order a lot. no refills on drinks everything is in a bottle (no cups) the burgers are wannabe Tommy burgers with chilly and such, but they fall way short. you can't take your food with you if you don't finish and they beat your ass like your momma should have if you don't finish. you can pick a burger, hot dog, fries or onion rings or chilli fries and thats it. no variety on any of it other than adding extra patties to the burger if you want. shit food shit menu shit drinks the place was sad dead dark and dreary with weird fucking music videos playing featuring the D squad from the strip club. Our waitress was friendly and nice but the place was just weird and creepy they snap at you if you take of the medical robe they force you to wear which i guess is good protects your clothes fro chili spill. but place sucked. had to pay for parking for stupid fremont street which is just a creepy scary place.. don't even get me started on it.. but anyway.. there's a decent idea here but it falls super short of what it could be. go else where for a burger unless you weigh like 350 pounds i think is, then you can eat for free, or if you like being spanked with a big ass wooden paddle while strangers record it on their cell phones to share with the world. oh and it's way over priced for what it is too."}
{"text":"I went here on my wedding day,  and I really enjoyed it. The menu was fun, and interesting. The burgers were ok, but the best part was the spankings for those who didn't finish their meal. My husband got three :)"}
{"text":"Great fun service with bland food.   The service is very fun, novel, and all around great.  The food itself though is bland and dry.   This is a place to go so you can say you ate with a hospital gown on and got spanked while in Vegas"}
{"text":"I paid $20 for a single Patty cheeseburgers fry milkshake two cokes .. to top it off the Burger had no flava .. of course I didn't eat all my food. I was extremely hungry when I left .. I just paid the bill.. hospital food taste better.. passed save your money."}
{"text":"I went because of the novelty and hype.  I've even had out-of-towners ask for this place specifically.  I found that people over 350 lbs. eat for free, and now I have a new goal.  The burger was OK, and the unlimited fries were a nice touch.  I can see why this place gets so much press.  Now for the big 3:  Service:  kind of sad.  The waitress seemed like she was put out to help us with our order, and she was often missing.  For example, I'd finished my soda, and waited over 5 mins. before she realized I was ready for more.  She never seemed happy to be there, regardless of the skimpy outfit she was dressed in.  Please don't expect playful or pleasing conversation from the wait staff.  Price:  It was 150% of what I expected.  A 1/2 lb. burger's avg. retail price is like, $5, and this is definitely more.  This alone will keep me from intentionally coming back, although, for the kitch of the place, I may bring out-of-towners.  It's definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  (double-down on the once part)  Taste:  It's a good burger.  Nothing notable, exciting, or overwhelming.  It's what you'd expect from a flat grill.  In the end, this place lives up to the hype.  It's cool to go once to say that you've been there.  The prices are too high for this to be a place for a regular customer base, so take pleasure in visiting this during your one time.  If you're over 350 lbs., then their pricing makes this the coolest place ever, for as long as your physicians will allow you to go.  Viva la Heart Attack Grill!"}
{"text":"The concept is very unique and fun. Unfortunately the food falls very short of what you would expect. The burgers are somewhat basic in flavor of the meat and have a bland taste. The fries were expected to be outstanding but they were limp, barely cooked and mushy. Overall I am glad I tried it but  not sure it is worth another trip."}
{"text":"mediocre burger. got the single. horrible service. will never ever ever ever ever ever come back here. would have gave 0 stars if possible. The waitress was very rude and the \"manager\" was as well. I'm upset that I spent my money here. I had family in town who really wanted to visit this place so I stayed if not for guests I would have left immediately when I realized that you had to wear a hospital gown to eat here. First and last time and I will make sure to let friends & family know about my horrible experience."}
{"text":"i love going to heart attack grill! service is amazing! and the burgers are better than burger king/mcdonald"}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a Sunday around 12:30PM in downtown Vegas. We went inside and were greeted by a chain guarding the entrance, a little note to the owners, a sign saying \"Please wait to be Seated\" works for every other restaurant in the world. There were about six people in the place with plenty of empty tables.  After waiting in the holding area for a few minutes a not very attractive or pleasant waitress arrived and told us we HAD to wear the hospital gowns and we HAD to either drink or dump out our Starbucks coffees we had because they don't allow outside drinks.   I get it, its a theme restaurant,  you have rules but you so do I about eating at a place with rude wait staff. The food looked good though, I didn't try it. The menu is VERY limited, burgers, fries, shakes and mexican coke. I love all of those things but it seems like they're are a LOT of unhealthy heart attack inducing foods out there to choose  from you may want to think about including some of them, oh, and ditch the chain and stupid rules."}
{"text":"What a joke.... I'm a local and would not revisit this HORRIBLE restaurant if it was the last place in Vegas. Upon arrival we were REQUIRED to put on a rediculous hospital gown. Yes, you are required to wear it or they refuse to serve you. We waited over 5 minutes to even be acknowledged by a server, granted the restaurant did have about 20 guests in it at the time. After ordering we waited another 10 minutes for our drinks to arrive, I think our server went on break because our food came out at about the same time.   The burgers were mediocre at best but the milkshake was delicious. This was the only positive part of my experience.   So let's recap, the service was obviously horrible which can't be surprising because anyone with have decent skills would not work there. The food was less than satisfactory minus the shake of course and the over-all attitude of the hostess and manager was \"if you don't like our rules, feel free to eat somewhere else\".   Don't worry, not only will I never eat there again, I will be sure everyone I know that comes to town is told to avoid this place. If it wasn't located in Las Vegas on Freemont street, it would servive 5 minutes with the attitude, terrible service and burgers that taste like something you would actually receive in a real hospital."}
{"text":"I give them credit for originality & creativity. this place is worth going to just for that experience to say that you have actually been there. The burgers are huge and come with an egg on them. I'm not a fan off eggs but its thin and the taste is light. The waitresses are what you would expect to find at some strip club and often flirt with the guests. Oh, and if you couldn't guess, this isn't a place for the kids. haha. The meat on the burger is good, but i have better many times before, and the fries are ok. I hope they stay open just because the idea is so inventive, but i don't know if i will be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Mmmmm now that's a tasty burger..... And of course the nurses were very nice too"}
{"text":"Staff is absolutely rude and will kill any attempts to really enjoy the place.  On the menu they advertise all you can eat fries and all you can drink coke. We were told this was not the case and this was only there to get people to buy it then they could be charged more for refills/more fries. The burgers were OK but thats about it. The waitress we had was rude and treated our entire party like trash. When we refused to tip she flipped out and demanded a tip as we were leaving. The Travel Channel has done a great disservice by even featuring this place. They do not deserve any business and seem to favor rude treatment of their customers and a \"bait and switch\" tactic in terms of advertising."}
{"text":"My chest hurts.  Heart attack grill is a fun idea and the theme is cool, but do I need to watch videos about the heart attack grill while I am sitting at the heart attack grill?    The fries were really good.  I guess the lard makes the difference, also they were hot and salty, so that is a major plus.    The burger was OK but not great.  I had the double, which is 1 lb. total.  The meat was alright, not awesome, not bad.  I would have preferred if they had more options (like bacon, different cheeses, grilled onions, onion rings to go on top, that type of stuff).    The shake was meh.  I had to stir in my own chocolate syrup(!?), and it was a little too thick to be refreshing.  I was really thirsty in the end.     Also, my friend doesn't do red meat and there was nothing for her.  Come on, I know you have a theme going, but not offering anything at all is just kind of douche-y.  How about a fried chicken sandwich, or a giant grilled cheese?    Overall, I'd say it was a three star experience."}
{"text":"Burger was pretty tasteless. I expected a super juicy, greasy burger based on the name of the place. definitely not worth the price. Interesting experience *maybe* one time only."}
{"text":"The Single Bypass was also more than enough for me, fun place to checkout, but not the best tasting burgers, hey, just go for the fun."}
{"text":"Someone really dropped the ball with this store. The gimmick they are selling which is hot nurses in small clothes is missing; so the gowns and scale and special names are cumbersome.  I walked out as soon as I felt the depressing atmosphere. I guess I didn't want a hamburger after all."}
{"text":"Saw this place recently while walking downtown Vegas. Of course we heard about it and read all the reviews. We wanted to just look inside. Ad was greeted by a completely snotty hostess. My wife had a coke in her hand from a previous snack and the girl at the front snapped a us saying loudly, \"we don't allow any outside drinks\" she was very nasty about it. I stated all we wanted to do was look around. Another couple walked in and we we still looking at the menu and staff dressed as nurses. The hostess said again, very loudly about no outside drinks. I would not eat here just due to the snotty and rude way we were greeted."}
{"text":"\"Ending anorexia one burger at a time\"  This is a very entertaining place to eat. I've been intrigued by this place ever since the Food Network aired a small episode on it..   Basically, fat people are welcome here. If you are over 350 pounds, you eat for free. Their menu is very simple. Burgers, fries, and milkshakes. It is a hospital themed restaurant and the servers are all scantily clad nurses. If it's your birthday or you don't finish your meal, you get a spanking in front of the whole restaurant. That encouraged me to eat my single bypass.   For about $52, we fed 5 people. That order consisted of 4 single bypass burgers with bacon, 2 large fries, 3 cokes, and 2 waters.   The burger was NOT bad at all. The fries were gross. Disgusting. I hate thick, wet, soggy fries. The fries tasted like bacon. Meh!  My bf broke a sweat eating the single bypass with fries. I laughed at him. I didn't break a sweat but it took me double the time to finish. i would come here again but not order the fries. The nurses were very friendly."}
{"text":"I had a decent 1lb double burger that was not juicy, it was sopping wet. Fries cooked in animal fat have good flavor, but they were a little limp and not very crispy. I had a PBR and a real sugar bottled Coke, which are really good.  If you haven't been to this place you should go, it's a fun place to visit. I went on a Saturday and I thought the young 'nurses' were some quality eye candy. I'm not going back because I respect my health to some degree. However, I was entertained and liked that the place doesn't pull any punches. Just go once, and cross it off your local bucket list."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and great environment!  We had double bypass and It was amazing! Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"SOLID 3.... Could've been a 4 rating. Yes the place has it gimmicks, yes the portions are huge. I ordered the single and boy was it big. Hubby ordered a double and barely finished it. We ordered the fries with chili and although the taste was good, I wish they would use a thicker cut fry.... The straw like fries really absorbed the oil and became soggy fast. Lastly, they do spank if you don't finish your meal, and yes it hard. Definitely visit if your in the area... Pretty good lunch place."}
{"text":"Food is disgusting and they refused to give me ice water .... isn't that against the law?"}
{"text":"We went to Heart Attack Grill for pure gluttony and it delivered. I expected it to be all gimmick, but I was pleasantly surprised that I did in fact enjoy the burger and fries.   I only had the single bypass, but others had the triple with bacon. Bun to meat ratio is quite good on the single. Great cheese and carmelized onions. My only complaint is that you have no choice on the temperature, all burgers are well done. I've had better burgers elsewhere, but I'd never request one well done. Considering its how this one comes it's pretty good. The bacon is very good if you choose to get it. Fries remind me of those I got as a kid. I prefer crisp and fluffy on the inside, but while these are a bit limp they have great flavor. I didn't have the shake, but a friend did. It was so filling he only finished half and had no room for his burger. It's thick like custard and the pat of butter is just a square that can easily be taken off.   I expected my visit to be a one time deal, but I would return. Note that it is cash only. A single bypass with bacon and fries will cost less than eleven bucks. Don't forget a drink and tip.  Come with a big appetite and sense of humor. I doubt you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this a 2 star because I liked my chili cheese fries, they were one of the best I've ever had.  I didn't like that it was \"mandatory\" to wear a hospital gown, and maybe I felt that way because I already had a Santa suit on from the Las Vegas Santa Run I just finished, but it made me feel stuffy.    The menu was more like a comic book and I was searching all over for the food, and the water.   They only serve bottled water! I am picky about my bottled water and it needs to be reverse osmosis. I just want my regular tap water with lemon.  Not paying for a bottle of water that I'm not going to enjoy.     And the utensils . I LOVE plastic forks. I use them at home. But when the fork is so cheap it bends when you eat your food, it pisses me off. Invest in a better fork with the profits your making off the bottled water . And then leaving, I don't even know what it's called but it's the rotating bar that spins down when you walk thru it and push it down. If your 350 pounds you can't even leave. And then to top it off, they try to up sell you on Souvenir's. It wasn't a fun or pleasant experience, and the seating is to close together , again if your catering to, or want larger people to come in, open up the space, I'm average size and felt trapped.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is a greaseball. You can taste the grease. If you are typically a healthy eater, you will be disappointed. I'd rather spend my unhealthy calorie budget on something else. The milkshakes are great though."}
{"text":"Zero stars!  I could go on and on about the horrific food my boyfriend and I attempted to eat at this place- burgers were like shoe leather and the \"fries\" looked like  a dirty, wet sponge-but I don't want to waste another moment on this \"establishment\".   You should be ashamed of yourself, owner of Heart Attack Grill. Worst food ever!  DO NOT EAT HERE!!"}
{"text":"Go figure that this place would close. I've been to the original one and that one was a million times better than the one here in Dallas. The fries were mushy and gross, the burger didn't taste half as good, and the entire place was simply dirty looking. I couldn't even finish my burger and fries when I was there. I kept thinking over and over on how much the original one was so much fun from the moment I entered, to walking up the fry station, to leaving stuffed.  Oh well... I guess everything is worth the try."}
{"text":"Not the best burger I've ever had, but a fun place to try with the coworkers on a Friday afternoon. I had the quadruple bypass and a few helpings from the all-you-can-eat fry station. Better than BK/McD's, but nothing to write home about. The waitresses were hot and they happily wheeled me out to my car in a wheelchair! But it's more of an attraction than anything else."}
{"text":"This place is fun! If you want a 5 star meal go somewhere else.  Gourmet to die for meals go somewhere else (although the chocolate shake with alcohol which is good for you is exceptional). They have the best vegan menu in the nation, I opted for the Lucky's.  I love the fact that everything about this place is politically incorrect. Come here for the fun of it,  go somewhere else if your a foodie."}
{"text":"Food is ok, but go to this restaurant  for experience. The place is hilarious! Great decorations. Waitresses wear sexy nurse outfit. Men have to visit the restroom - there are two urinals:  one with Bush's portrait and another with Obama's. Pick your favorite president . . . Lol!   And if you don't finish your meal you get some nice spanking:)"}
{"text":"Decent prices for what you get. I had the single bypass Burger without the chili, but with bacon. It was a good size and well prepared. 5 strips of ok bacon and a nice bun. The fries were a tad over done, but I tend to like them that way. I had the chocolate 'shake'. It comes with a pat of butter on top. I didn't even try to eat that. The shake was served with a spoon. Why they call it a milkshake is beyond me. It more closely resembles a frosty at Wendy's, but without the malt flavouring.   I ate all my food so I didn't get spanked. My waitress was pretty good looking, so I suggested that I should get to spank her. She had a sense of humour (I think you kinda have to at a place like this) but she declined.   I'd go there again for another burger no problem. I watched two people walk out because they didn't get the theme. Pretty stupid of them I thought."}
{"text":"If your looking for good food don't bother. If your looking for an over priced mediocre burger stop in. The atmosphere is fun and campy, the wait staff wear scrubs and tight nurses uniforms. The burger was OK but nothing special, while the fries were a bit soggy and cool. Staff was very friendly and a fun. As a guest you are to wear a patients gown and patient ID band. Guest over 350 lbs eat free and if you don't finisher your burger you get paddled on the behind."}
{"text":"If you like grease on everything then I guess being fat is ok, because over 350 pounds eat free. I really didn't want to go here but my friends dragged me here. I'm pro health and run 2 miles a day back home, but why not, won't hurt me just try a simple burger. Hey I might have some fun. First, I had to wear the patient costume. Stupid! Then the prices are very high 10 bucks for a plain burger, what a joke. Second, very unhealthy food and the owner promotes this marketing 100%, which is very sick. I left before I order because I still want to live a long life! Plus rude service!"}
{"text":"This is the real deal.  If you want a heart attack or clogged arteries; this is the place to be.  I thought the owner of this 'restaurant of death' also recently died himself.  Not a suprise...  Although if you don't eat here every day, like we - tourists from Belgium - do; The Heartattack Grill is an an unmissable experience!  So if you are near Fremont street, feel free to jump in for a scoop of fat fries and a lump of meat.  If you can eat the 'bypass burger' you don't have to pay for it... If you can't... you get spanked with a piece of wood... on your butt.. Welcome to America! :-)"}
{"text":"Many things have been said of the Heart Attack Grill. About their use of lard to make burgers and fries. About the record-setting butter fat content of their shakes. About their Guinness Book of World Records-backed claim as the unhealthiest restaurant on the planet. If there was ever a restaurant that truly deserves to be in Las Vegas, it's this one.   But is it any good? Well I went in to find out.    This restaurant is truly an experience. You are greeted at the door by sexy nurses who dress patrons in hospital gowns. Wine is served on an IV drip and shots are given on injections (or pill bottles). Can't finish your food? (Likely, as the portions are huge) The nurses will bend you over a rack/torturing device and spank you with a paddle. Hard.   There are essentially two entrees: a huge chili dog and the bypass burgers that go from the one-patty single bypass to the quadruple bypass and beyond. There are no substitutions. You want bacon on that double bypass? Then you get 10 slices. No compromises. Do you weigh 350 pounds or more? You eat for free.  I ordered the double bypass and could barely get a whole bite in my mouth.  How others are able to consume the larger burgers, I can't imagine.   But are they any good you ask? Well, yes and no. There is a point of diminishing returns. I thought it was a pretty good burger and the flavor of the chili fries we ordered was just right for me (my brother/accomplice thought they needed more acidity) but eventually all the lard and fat giving the food flavor does catch up with you and coats your stomach and mouth to the point where you want to stop. It was precisely at that point where, while struggling to finish our chili fries,  we witnessed a man and woman get spanked for not finishing their food. It was no joke. They got decked pretty hard and we promptly cleaned or plate.   Even with that, I can't help but recommend you visit this joint. It's a whole lot of over the top fun and when you're in Vegas, that's kind of the point. Besides, the mural depicting a very funny (and very politically incorrect) version of Da Vinci's The Last Supper, along with the rest of the decor is worth the price of the food alone."}
{"text":"Such slow service took over 30 min to get out meal and it wasn't even crowded!! Not worth it! Good for taking pictures outside"}
{"text":"It is what it says...   The drinks and milkshakes are really good.  The atmosphere was fun and creative.  Waitstaff all got along and enjoyed interacting with the customers.  The food is super rich and it's pretty difficult to leave that place without a stomach ache due to everything being fried in lard."}
{"text":"They refused to allow me and my service dog in the restaurant despite having all my paperwork on hand and advising them of ADA rights for service animals... their rationale: \"she doesn't look like a service dog\" and \"we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.\""}
{"text":"I don't recommend this place, took my kids here because they saw it on TV and I regret it. The service is horrible they act like they dont need our business and the food is terrible. the burgers and fries taste like lard, they have stupid rules we got kicked out in the middle of our dinner because my 5 year old son did not have hes adult size hospital gown on right wich they supplied.....do your health a favor and stay away!!!"}
{"text":"I am utterly disappointed and disgusted at the service and the quality of the food. I spent 27 dollars of my hard earned money they messed up the order 3 times and on the third try after waiting for over an hour to receive food it was so disgusting I barfed on the sidewalk outside after I spent money on garbage!  Do not waste your time or your stomach!!!!!"}
{"text":"*attention service animal owners/handlers* Staff will request to see \"papers\" upon arrival and don't understand proper procedures in terms of allowing access. The manager initially refused service to my gf and I requesting to see \"papers.\" Attempts were made by my gf to try and educate staff but we were still refused entry on grounds of \"private property.\" When attempting to get in contact with LVPD a waitress came out to say that the manager just saw the service dog vest and allowed us access. The manager came back to apologize to us after we finished eating and my gf gave out service animal cards to help educate the staff. The owner needs to change his policy for services animals or more bad press and potential business damaging lawsuits will be in the works."}
{"text":"This place. I always wanted to go here and finally got my chance when I was passing through town. I was previously in the Phoenix area and was surprised that that location closed down. I found this one in Vegas by accident.  Walked in there with a friend around 11, a large crowed just left and it seemed pretty empty. We were greeted right away and had the gowns put on. They were nice and clean, I dont know why people complain about them.  The service was slow, infact, no one came to our table for a few minutes, I see this complain a lot. There were nurses out there but they were cleaning tables up. There appears to be poor communication between the hostess and the waitress. Even though they all carry iPods touch to take your order, you would think this would not be a problem.  During our visit, Epic Meal Time was filming an episode a table away and received a lot of attention from the owner and a few nurses. A lack of service to us was expected because of this. Nothing terrible.  I ordered a Double Bypass with extra bacon. The burger was nothing special. I was surprised by its dullness. I've had some great burgers at other places, for what this restaurant has going on, they should really work on improving their burgers. They lake in flavor. The fries were soggy, I dont know if they were just poorly made or what you get when you deep fry them in lard.  Otherwise, the place was pretty good. A nice challenge for those late nights. I really hope the owner sees that his restaurants keep getting poor reviews and do something about it. I honestly think they have a good idea just poorly implement.  As far as anyone else complaining about stupid things like no diet cola, or cash only, or that you cant split a meal. Srsly? You come to a place called Heart Attack Grill and complain about these things? Get over it."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst mystery meat hamburger I've ever had.  Ordered a single with no chili, however it still tasted like chili.  Horrid!!  Worst burger ever."}
{"text":"We couldn't wait to try this place more out of curiosity. We had to really talk my brother into wearing the hospital gown, though. He was not up for wearing the gown while eating his hamburger. With the help of some nurses there, we got it on him. Phew! I like the idea of the theme, theme restaurants in general and poking fun at high-caloric, bad-for-you food. I found \"wheeling you out in a wheelchair if necessary,\"the blood pressure machine at the door, the nurse outfits and the gowns, etc. hilarious! The service was OK, and for the most part they were friendly and happy to take pictures of you. However, the hamburgers were not that great...pretty bland and dry. It's one of those places that's good to just try once and that's it."}
{"text":"My opinion?? Skip this joint. Of course everyone knows about this place by hearing it on Travel Channel or Food Network but it's not all it's made out to be. The theme is funny and they play good music. I'll give it that much. That's what the 1 star is for.   Pros:  -Funny theme  Cons: -Icky smell when you walk in. -Unless you get their smallest burger you can't split anything. -Shakes are unedible. Like they blended a stick of butter in every shake. (it actually comes with a pat of butter sitting right on top. We all agreed it was the worst shake we ever tasted.) -Cant order Diet Coke cause they don't do anything \"diet\"  -They REFUSE to serve their guests water (even if it's super hot out. Its VEGAS!!!) They say if you want water the closest thing they have is iced tea. I feel that this has nothing to do with the unhealthy theme of the restaurant it's just a scam so that you HAVE to pay for a drink. -Their food isn't even that good. -Cash only. -Their \"what you see is what you get\" attitude.  Final thought??   There are MANY restaurants that are known for their gigantic portions or over-the-top calorie count meals that have better food AND the service and the atmosphere are a million times better than this place. I get their gimmick, it's just executed VERY poorly."}
{"text":"My first experience here was a 5 star experience. The waitress was great. Food was pretty good and the mixed drink was strong. Just the way I like it. The last time we went, the experience was awful. I am picky when it comes to my food. Their hamburgers now come with chili on it. I asked if they can please put the chili on the side. I don't know if I like it, so I certainly don't want it smothering my hamburger, If I did like it, I would put it on myself. The waitress said they don't put food on the side. So I couldn't get any chili. Come on! How hard is it to put whatever you put on the burger,  on the side!? I'm paying for it. Just slap it on the side! Jease. Then I asked for a water, the waitress says, \"bottled?\"  I said, \"no, tap is fine\". She says, \"We don't have any\"  Umm... no tap!? I'm hoping she didn't know what tap water is and she thought I was asking for some fancy high priced water! LOL This experience not so great, because of it, I doubt I will go back on my next trip to Vegas. A customer should be able to order their food the way they like it."}
{"text":"Well. We went here.  We were greeted by 2 peppy and upbeat cute 20something girls. We were expecting that to be the case when we were sat.  Still waiting.  Still waiting.  Still waiting.  I am not lying one bit when I say, we waited 18 minutes and not ONE person came to greet us, serve us water or even acknowledge us.  We left after waiting 18 minutes for someone to come over. When we walked out the same 2 girls said, \"bye, thanks for coming. How was everything?\"  I literally walked out the door with my friend as our other friend filed a complaint.  They did NOTHING to get us back to eat there, NOTHING.  This happened around 2-3PM this past Sunday, 7/9/2012."}
{"text":"This place is a try-once gimmick. I laughed, thought it was interesting, ate, felt nauseous, and have never felt the need to return."}
{"text":"So the one thing I disliked the most about this place is you cannot share your food at all.  I could not even share fries with my husband!  This means if you are a tourist you will end up throwing away anything you don't eat as our hotels have no fridge.  The food is not that great either.  So make sure you take that into consideration."}
{"text":"Is the Heart Attack Grill a bit of a tourist trap? Well, of course it is, but the prices aren't outrageous. It's a fun time, so be a tourist and go! We chose the single heart attack with bacon. Well done is the only option, but our burgers were very tasty and our meal was well presented. Then there were the fries. If you don't believe that McDonalds makes the best fries in the known universe, then you probably believe that soccer is,actually, a sport. We've eaten a lot of fries across the U. S. & Canada and HAG gets the silver medal. Cudos th Doctor Andrew, our very friendly & capable host. For service & food, TravelingbyCarr GandR calls it 3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Watch your friends who cant finish a burger and complete strangers get spanked. IV bags of wine help."}
{"text":"It was a fun experience. The concept is both hysterical and horrifying. The food was average but the threat of a public spanking did invent me to finish my plate.  All in all a fun Vegas experience.  Not fine dining but worth the trip."}
{"text":"Decent burger, a bit overpriced, but a definite tourist destination. Make sure you have cash, plastic not accepted."}
{"text":"This place was a bit of a let down. You hear so much about it, then you walk in the door and you feel underwhelmed. It seems a bit run down, the place has definitely seen better days.  The food has seen better days too. The burger wasn't anything to write home about. The fries were ok. Not bad, not good, just average. I did enjoy the strawberry shake, though. That was pretty above average.  My overall feeling? It's a tourist trap. Literally. Heaven help you if you don't have cash. Who doesn't take debit cards anymore? Seriously? And the price is pretty absurd. If I'm paying that much for something, your establishment should look better for sure, and the food should be of a higher caliber."}
{"text":"This place is super inappropriate and offensive! Definitely not a place for young families. From the last supper blasphemy mural to the smut that is on all of the screens wherever you look. The food is so so and the nurses(waitresses) are so snobby that you wonder if they should just find another job. I will not return."}
{"text":"Honestly, I stopped here to watch people instantly die while eating this garbage.   It didn't happen.   So I moved on.   So should you."}
{"text":"So much fun.  I only went for the experience, not the food. You are in for a treat! Never been to anywhere like it. If you have an open mind, love to laugh, and like creative ideas check it out. I had a blast!"}
{"text":"This place had a cool theme, but the food was sub par.. The burger was blan and nothing better than a fast food burger with 3000 calories. The decorations were about the best part of the visit."}
{"text":"Toughest place to rate. Atmosphere was great. Service very good. Place was a blast. Food sucked especially for the price. But I'd say come for the fun get drunk and order the cheapest thing. Split a burger and have a blast."}
{"text":"Great place I was expecting a burger place but this is way more fun. And free spankings. Burgers are food and beer is cold and waitresses are hot."}
{"text":"The food is okay. Like the other reviews say you go there more for the experience. Its fun to watch but if your not gonna finish your food and dont want to get embarrassed just order fries."}
{"text":"A fun and original hamburger joint. It's located in the Neonopolis Plaza. Before you are seated you are issued a hospital gown and wristband. I had the single bypass hamburger and fries. You can have up to a four patty burger(the quadruple bypass hamburger). They have a scale in the middle of the restaurant, if you weigh 350 lbs. or more you eat for free. The burger is pretty much average and the fries below average. The fries look burnt although don't taste like they are. Probably from being cooked in lard. The big plus of the Heart Attack Grill are the servers/nurses. They take your order and bs with you for a few minutes. This probably causes the slow process of receiving your food(Even at 10:00pm). A must-see for hamburger connoisseurs visiting Las Vegas."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE FOR THE FOOD! It's pretty bad! But the overall experience is fun and you will certainly have a laugh!"}
{"text":"The Double Bypass hamburger was great. But that is the only reason why I gave this place 3 stars.  The Drink selection is POOR. Only Ice tea when asked for splenda, or equal I was told they did not have, only sugar. Asked what kind of soft drinks,  only coke. No sprite, Dr. pepper or anything else.  The Fries were just ok. but not really worth mentioning. The shakes tasted like you put a straw into a stick of butter, so skip it.  The service was average."}
{"text":"This place was gross meat was like sponge. No wonder they spank everyone at the restraunt if you dont finish the meal they give u the paddle so we wrapped our food in napkins yuck!"}
{"text":"Saturday around noon with two buddies, hung over before baseball game. Menu similar to in and out......burgers, fries and drink. The burgers look cheap but are good. Very cool art work. Pretty cheap for the quantity of food. Cool employees..laid back. Its also mandatory to wear a hospital gown, hahaha. Plus no greens......hence heart attack grill.......6.7 out of 10."}
{"text":"I went to this amazing restaurant that serves burgers that are unbelievably good and huge in size. I weight in on a scale that is infront of the building and weighted in at 175 and was not about to weight myself to see how much food I eat. The girls that work there are very nice and cute in the nurse uniforms. The cheapest burger is $9 something but it's huge and I could not finish. The place gets really packed and the entrance is very small. As soon as you walk in it's like boom a menu the you get a hospital gown. Fun place it's a must to have fun with a stage."}
{"text":"Food is good, spankings are funny and waitresses are cool. The food is UNHEALTHY...VERY BAD FOR YOU...don't eat here if you're gonna complain about it.   Don't over order or else you'll get three VERY painful spankings... the nurses don't go easy on you."}
{"text":"Heart Attack Grill is one of those places that is worth checking out but only as a one time experience. The idea is that you are in a hospital as a patient and all the waitresses are nurses. When you first enter, everyone is clothed with a hospital gown before you are seated.   As far as food, it was mediocre. There aren't really too many options due to the nature of the restaurant. If you generally enjoy milkshakes, I'd be very cautious about trying the one at Heart Attack Grill. I do enjoy my milkshakes but the one here that I had a taste of was just way too thick - it tasted just like pudding. If thats your style, maybe you'd enjoy it but I'm glad it wasn't something that I ordered off the menu.  A cool item I saw on the menu was the wine (someone ordered it during the time we were dining there) - it is served in an IV bag on a pole.  If you don't finish your meal, you're supposed to get 3 spankings from a nurse in front of the whole restaurant (or sing karaoke). Also, the restaurant is cash only!"}
{"text":"Saw this genius on the news. So touristy, walked past and had to try it. Did the double bypass, it was about what you would expect but the butter fat strawberry milkshake is ridiculously good. For the experience it is ok, nothing great. A fresh big mac or Wendy's burger is better. Is interesting to weigh yourself before you go in and then after. 4 lb dinner."}
{"text":"A \"must try once\" restaurant in Las Vegas  Pros: * Very unique experience. Restaurants staffs dress as either nurses or doctors, and they give customer a gawn to dress as patient. If you can't finish your burger, the waitress are going to spank your butt 3 times hard, very hard * See many guys raising their butt and being spank, it's hard to not to laugh * Price is decent, a lot more cheaper than we thought.  Cons: * Burger taste is plain; In and Out is way better * Heart Attack Grill is locating off the strip * A lot of food are being wasted because their quad burgers are huge, I wouldn't expect a normal soul can even finish half of that thing  Hints: * It's cash only * If you order fries, soda, and some other sides, then their single bypass burger would be big enough for two people (that's the only size that can be share unless you want to get spank, then go ahead to order something bigger) * Bring your camera to capture your friends or others being spank"}
{"text":"OMG....you must experience this place when you visit Vegas.  We didn't eat...but had a few drinks at the bar....and it was worth it.  You must wear a hosptial gown and the waitresses are \"nurses\".  We enjoyed watching other \"patients\" get spanked for not finishing their food.  Our bartender,. Stephanie, was awesome!   Great place to stop in for a drink and laughs."}
{"text":"This is an excellent establishment for what it is: a kitschy, kooky, fun theme restaurant! Don't expect the best food (that's like expecting Chuck'e Cheese's to serve gourmet) but do come with an open mind and an attitude of fun.   Apart from the cash only policy, you are also warned that you might get a spanking if you don't finish your food. Remember, NO SHARING any burger larger than a single! If you are male and order larger, get your butt ready for a spanking!   Truthfully, most guys come in for the spanking. It adds a lot of fun to the place and it's totally funny watching the guys get spanked. The ladies working the paddle make sure to add as much force as they can to the whooping too, you know the guys will feel the swipes hours, maybe even days after.   The staff are all very friendly and efficient. For such a large place, we never had to flag anyone down. There was always someone asking if we needed anything and checking up on how we were doing with our orders.   It was my idea to come here (hey, it's Vegas, and I choose to be stupid with food instead of other, um, pleasures) so I had to order the Quadruple Bypass. The male server actually went, \"YOU'RE having the quad?\" in surprise when he brought us the food. :))  Food wise, don't expect anything special. The burger patties are large and dense. They taste ok but we're a but dry. The bacon was really well cooked though. They remained crunchy even overnight, when we checked the leftovers. The hotdog itself was too salty, the mayo and mustard on the table help cut the saltiness.   If you like places like this, go. It's fun and it gives good pictures."}
{"text":"My husband needed to go here bc he saw it on TV! HAHA.. it was worth going to for the experience, but I would never go back.  We split a little burger and chilli cheese fries and it was okay, not bad but not really good.  Our waitress was snotty and didnt really want to be bothered by us or with her job in general.  But the experience and atmosphere was worth it, that one time.    WHAT WE DID NOT LIKE: They do not allow you to share your burger unless you order the 1 patty burger. My husband really wanted the double patty burger and I was just going to have a few bites, but they wouldnt allow it! SO STUPID."}
{"text":"So i show up to the restaurant, i had 80 dollars on my wallet i asked if i can get change for a 20, handed the money to lady serving us. She placed the 20 in change on the table. I took the change to completed the transaction witch was 32 dollars even. I handed her a 20 and 2 fives with 2 dollars tip was 3. Evened it out with 35 dollard after i payed that, she asked for the 20 more to cover the change. It wasnt till i noticed my wallet money was 25. I calculated everything and it 45 that was suppose to be in my wallet. Turns out the lady wasnt aware of the extra 20 i handed her i asked her and she said i gave her the correct amount owe . Denied that i had gave her wrong change. So with that said make sure you guys count your MONEY !!I DIDNT GET MY 20 BACK!"}
{"text":"This place was a huge waste of money.  The burgers were tasteless and the fries had no seasoning.  The theme is cool and the wait staff were friendly.  This is a cash only place so hit the ATM if you don't need this warning.  The sodas were also gross.  Who messes up soda????"}
{"text":"Great food, resonabke prices. Also agree with their message, they are really trying to raise awareness of the dangers of fast food, and the owner is unapologetically honest. I respect that."}
{"text":"Definitely a different experience. I would not recommend this place for the quality of the food; definitely nothing special about it; as a matter of fact they advertise how bad it is for you and they are proud of it. But you don't go there for the quality but the fun, and that is ok, especially if you are entertaining some guests in town. Our first experience was actually very good, thanks to the friendly service. For some reason, they only accepted cash and their hours are not very long, considering they are on the busiest place in Vegas. Regardless, be ready for a fun visit especially if you enjoy watching people getting spanked (for not finishing their meal) or even better if you like to be on the receiving end. And those spanks are pretty heavy! They will not spare you if you can handle it... Menu choice is very limited and wacky (Burgers are offered with up to six patties!, (The \"sextuple bi-pass\"), decor is very simple, but again, you are not going there for a nice date; they actually make you wear hospital gowns and some drink are offered on an IV drip, and need I mention, the waitresses are dressed as nurses....well more like naughty nurses...."}
{"text":"My friends, and family went to Vegas to attend my wedding, and afterwards we wound up on Fremont at this AMAZING hamburger joint!!!! This was SO much fun, the drinks, and Jell-O shots were plentiful, the food OUTSTANDING, and the staff very friendly!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place to anyone looking for good food, and a fun experience!!"}
{"text":"ridiculous concept......lame servers.....cash only......kind of gross food.....I would never set foot in this place again."}
{"text":"Once upon a time a young Australian named Scott ventured to a far off land named Las Vegas. Scott had heard tales of magical machines that sometimes, but rarely gave you money if you pushed buttons on them for long enough. Scott heard of ladies that wore very little and drinks that were very large. He also heard tales of burgers the size of a small child and it became his quest while in this strange land to track down, and devour one of these famed burgers.  Not deterred by the reviews of a mixed nature to be found on the magical tome known as Yelp, Scott set his sights on the Heart Attack Grill. Neon signs beckoned him forth. Posters in the windows told him that alcohol was good for him. Scott agreed. He stepped through the doors, with his beloved (and vegetarian) wife in tow, and was promptly greeted by a young lady in a nurses uniform. This was not like any nurse Scott had seen before. Nurses dressed in such skimpy attire in the strange land of Vegas. Upon being greeted Scott was cloaked in a surgical gown that no doubt had magical properties and was led to his waiting table.  The Grill was quiet, for it was late afternoon on a week day. Scott ordered a Double Bypass burger and when asked if extra bacon would be required Scott answered \"Yes, yes it will\". Scott's wife, the vegetarian Leisha, simply smiled and ordered a large beverage of an amber liquid known as beer.   Before too long the burger had arrived. It was as large as the fables had told and Scott was quite pleased, though a little shocked. Scott was not expecting the food in this strange place to be of what looked to be good quality. The fries looked crisp and brown and tasted slightly of lard. Lard is good.  The burger glistened in the light. Scott looked around the room at the images on the wall that parodied films of yesteryear and smiled, then picked up the weighty burger with two trembling hands and took his first bite. It was good. Very good. Surprisingly good actually. This challenge would be a welcome one with such delicious treats on offer. Leisha asked Scott how his burger tasted as she sipped from her mammoth beer. \"Delicious\" was Scott's reply through mouthfuls of juicy meat before diving back in.   Before too long Scott was halfway through his burger and he was beginning to falter. But Scott's will was strong. He could not return to his home in Australia letting this challenge best him, so he bunkered down and dove back in. The burger was rapidly decreasing in size, as Scott felt he was rapidly increasing in size. And then, with one almighty fist pump the final bite was downed and Scott was victorious. He was elated.   After an appropriate resting time Scott rose to his feet and felt several kilograms heavier as he waddled to the door and the outside world with a grin on his face and a cow in his stomach. Victory was his, but it was not the poor gentleman's who was currently bent over a table being spanked by a nurse."}
{"text":"Really fun place and the staff are excellent. Upon arrival, you'll be asked to put on an 'operating' gown before being shown to your table. The menu is fairly simple and made up mostly of combinations of burgers. But the clue is in the name folks- don't expect fine cuisine here! It's dirty, greasy and more of a novelty than a meal. There is a drinks menu with a limited selection of beer, but they do have a nice IPA."}
{"text":"Just awful. Absolutely awful.  The theme of this place is interesting but besides that there's absolutely no reason to go here. Any other burger place would be a better choice.    The burgers were indeed large but the bacon was ice cold and the quality of the meat left much to be desired. And to top it all off, they spank you if you don't finish their terrible food.   Interesting theme and cute waitresses aside, there's no reason to ever subject your stomach to this awful food."}
{"text":"Man what can we say about this place? Karen and I went there of course due to seeing it from Travel Channel and we were both excited but left so disgusted and very disappointed. The lard on the burger buns? Wow that's just nasty and don't get me started on the smell of that. Pretty cool place to visit and take photos though but dont eat there if you don't have to."}
{"text":"The burger was good, the fries were ok, but once you mentally process that they were deep fried in lard, then what was tasting really good turned into a really guilt-loaded dinner. But it is what it says it is. A truly American restaurant, proud of its decadence."}
{"text":"Are u freaking kidding me?! This place is horrible! I am down to eat a delicious 5 thousand calorie burger any day, but not if it tastes like crap! I paid 16 dollars for a giant old tasting burger that had flavorless meat and came with disgusting soggy fries that look like burnt fingers!  It's dirty and a tourist trap! Too bad too! Everyone love a good burger! Never again Heart Attack Grill!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place was quite the experience. If you don't finish your food you can choose to be spanked.   The bacon comes in 5s it seems and everything is not health friendly from what I've seen. The food was not out of this world or anything, but it was pretty good. I would definitely go here again, if I had time.   The service and feel of this place was amazing. It just makes it a fun experience. I wouldn't go here solely based on food, go here if you're trying something new.  I tried a burger and fries, because I'm simple. There was just too much food though! I got spanked :( It was fun though.  Didn't get the name of the bartender but she served us. (The lady on the menu, image below).  The milkshake comes with a piece of butter, which is strange but if you're going here you're not trying to win any fitness contests.  Again, great place, fun, and would go again if I had time."}
{"text":"Its no pretending here.  Its a bad for you burger.  Its almost old fashioned before non hydrogenated whats its oils and crap.  Its meat, lard, bun.  REAL sugar cokes and frys done in lard.  Yes you can get monster burgers here and that is their \"fame\" but they are also good.  I have never had any issues at all about servce, and never promised, read or anything about a free burger if you eat it.  Give it a shot to find out what food is suppose to be before the invention of artificial everything (just not often)."}
{"text":"This themed restaurant is one of my favorites and up there with Dick's Last Resort.  Their burgers are absolutely artery-cloggingly good.  The fries are definitely different than that of McDonald's or In 'n Out, so don't expect the norm.  Their shakes and margaritas are the absolute strongest and probably best you'll find, even in Vegas.  The servers and cooks and owner are fantastic, happy, courteous, and a pleasure to see and be around.  The funnest thing about this restaurant is the theme and environment.  Notoriously unhealthy food, hospital atmosphere, the name says it all.  And if you weigh over 350 lbs, you eat for free!  Awesome work!"}
{"text":"The show is fun and service is crazy.  But the burger taste like a microwaved patty, the fries are frozen junk! Overall food is terrible, but the entertainment is super fun!  It's fun to go once and that's it don't need to go back after that!"}
{"text":"Yes I am actually giving another burger joint 5 Stars. This is only the second time I've ever given a burger joint 5 Stars. The first was a Red Robin in the Fair Lakes area of Fairfax County Virginia, not Red Robin in general. Been to many Red Robin's but the Fair Lakes restaurant deserve 5 stars not so much the other Red Robin's. In fact the Fairfax one is the only one I'll go to. The Heart Attack Grill is located on Fremont Street in the Fremont Street Experience area of Las Vegas.   Now about the 5 Stars. The reason I gave the 5 stars to the Fairfax Red Robin is for a completely different reason I'm giving the 5 stars to the Heart Attack Grill. As Ricky Ricardo would say I have some \"splaining\" to do.   Here goes. The Red Robin was because of the quality of the food, the atmosphere of the restaurant and the exceptional customer service. Now the quality of the food from the Heart Attack Grill isn't as good as the Red Robin. Don't get me wrong the burger was a good one. The ambience of the restaurant isn't quite the same but I will tell you the Heart Attack Grill was really a lot of fun, the most fun I've ever had in a burger joint. The atmosphere here is fun and hilarious. Plus, I got spanked by a cute waitress in a sexy nurse outfit, how about them apples. Of course just the fact that it's located in the Fremont Street Experience give it a little nudge up. If you put all these pieces together you get 5 stars for sure.  Also, let me ad, the customer service is very good. The whole premise is that the food is bad for you. Let's be honest, the Heart Attack Grill is honest. McDonalds and Burger King and all those other fast food joints know their food is not healthy. But in their defense, they never expected people to eat in their restaurants so often. I know people that eat fast food 5 or 6 days a week and they wonder why they are in poor health, DUH. In moderation McDonalds and Burger King are fine.   At the Heart Attack Grill if your over 350 pounds you can eat for free. It's all about being unhealthy and it's just fun an hilarious. They make you wear a hospital gown and all the waiters and waitresses are like nurses and doctors.   Even in Yelp, when you check into the Heart Attack Grill you get three free spankings from a nurse. My wife got spanked from a male nurse and I a female nurse. How great is that? a burger and a spanking? Does it get any better than that? No my friends it doesn't. I even got a nurse beer. (See pictures) and my wife got a shot of rum and the shots come in a prescription medicine bottle lol. With warning on it.   The food came out pretty quickly and the burger was pretty darn good, the fries were good too. The customer service is way above average. Everyone there was super friendly and nice. They all looked like they were having a good time. I would guess working there would be fun, the restaurant is all about having a good time. The prices are very reasonable as well.   There also have t-shirts and other souvenirs. One more thing in the urinals in the bathroom you can pee on either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, it's worth the visit just to do that. I'm not going to tell you who I did it to.  So yes, you put all these things together you get 5 stars. You have to make this a stop while visiting Las Vegas. Next year we are bring my daughter and her husband when me make our next trip to Las Vegas and you can bet we'll be bringing them to the Heart Attack Grill."}
{"text":"A restaurant in the desert that charges 2 bucks for a bottle of water."}
{"text":"We went to the Heart Attack Grill because it sounded like it would be a fun experience, and it was. If you weigh over 350 pounds you eat for free, and you can weigh yourself on a scale right outside the restaurant. When I heard \"They spank you if you don't finish\" I thought they mean playfully. No. I was so wrong. They wind up with a paddle and smack you, hard! They left one poor girl with the back end redder than fire. It was entertaining to watch, but will strike fear into you to finish whatever you order. You can ask to get spanked if you so wish.    I give the restaurant a 5 for it's theming. It's medical themed. They have you dress in gowns, bring out wine in IV bags and have shots in a plastic syringe. Employees are dressed in scrubs and nurses uniforms. It was a fun experience. Although the food was only okay.   I give the food a 3. They have a limited number of drinks to choose from, and the menu is pretty small as well so choices are limited. I got the Coronary dog, half pound hot dog with Chili. I felt like the chili was bland and the hot dog just tasted off. My husband tried the hot dog as well and felt the same. I was disappointed in how it tasted. Everyone else in our party seemed to like their burgers. The onion rings were good, but not anything special.   Overall it's a fun experience best shared in a group, but don't expect the best food."}
{"text":"This is one of the most unique burger joints I have ever experienced.  You can't help but notice this place with its bright lights and huge scale out front.  Apparently if the scale states you weigh over 350lbs, a bell will ring and your meal is on the house.  As you walk in, you are greeted by \"nurses.\"  They give you an ID bracelet and fit you in a hospital gown.  The menu was simple by offering four different type of burgers (single, double, triple, or quadruple patties), fries, and drinks (water, coke, or shake.)  Everyone at my table decided to go simple and order he single bypass burger while one brave soul attempted the quadruple bypass.  I felt like the burger was one of the most tasteless burgers I have ever tried.  The fries wasn't good either because they were hard and not seasoned well.  There is also a catch about ordering the quadruple bypass burger: if you attempt this challenge and fail, a nurse will come over and punish you (get spanked in the ass with a paddle three times as hard as they like).  I feel like the guys wouldn't take that as a punishment.  LoL.  But my friend forced himself to finish the burger and ended up with food coma at the end of the day.    All in all, it was a good experience to see what downtown Vegas offered but I wouldn't recommend or return back to this place.  If you are craving for some burgers, go check out In-n-Out or Jack in a Box instead.  A way better way to spend your money."}
{"text":"They told me that one person has actually died here, and then they showed me his ashes that are kept behind the bar.  The hospital gowns and themed waitstaff are an interesting gimmick. Burgers are relatively cheap, I think I ordered a triple cheeseburger with 15 pieces of bacon for 12$. As for the actual quality of the food, mediocre. Go for the photo opp and the extreme depression that will follow your clogged arteries, don't go for the taste."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and get a nice old fashion spanking if you don't finish your food. Loved it."}
{"text":"If you care to be spanked for not finishing your food then you may want to stop by this joint in downtown Vegas. I celebrated a few days (6) out in Vegas with wife and friends. We were out celebrating good times and my big 4-0. My friends thought it would be a good idea to get me the heart attack burger. There were like 18 patties(exaggerating a bit), cheese, and red onions galore. They just wanted me to get spanked. I love pain so I didn't care. I ate 6 of the patties. I could have finished it but wanted to give the guys the satisfaction.   My friends ordered smaller meals but begged for some punishment. You get broadcasted online for all to see. It's a fun place to visit with lots of people. I had a lot of tourists around me taking pics of me and the burger. It was totally worth it after a day of golf and boozing pool side. Stop by and have fun."}
{"text":"Well I needed a doctor...hmm...a nurse I mean during a visit at the Heart Attack Grill !  Fortunately with an empty stomach, I was able to complete my double patty with cheese and not get spanked by a lovely nurse.  My strategy besides coming in hungry: 1. Eat one patty with one bun 2. Finish 3. Eat the other patty with the other bun 4. Finish and Done!  The burger was good and the atmosphere festive of course.  The promo videos of the staff is comical and a delight.  I would come back for a spanking..i mean burger in the future!"}
{"text":"The Heart Attack Grill is a lot of fun. The first thing they do is have a really hot waiter or waitress dress you in  a hospital gown while being \"admitted\" to the restaurant. A very sexy and overly friendly nurse/waitress with a mini-skirt and low-cut blouse will come to your table to help you order. She will sit down and talk with you while you order.  They have a vegan menu, it has one item on it, cigarettes. Ordering carefully is very important here, because if you do not finish your burger the nurse/waitress spanks you with a wooden paddle in front of all the dinners in the restaurant. I do not think they spank very hard because the guys were lining up for spanking as others took photos of them being spanked. Even though I finished my single burger and she offered to spank me just for the hell of it. I politely declined. If you claim to weigh over 350 pounds, they will put you on a scale to weigh you. If you reach the magic number, you eat for free. One guy was over 350 pounds, so the whole room cheered for him. When the drinks are delivered, they are bought out in an IV Bag (intravenous bag) on an IV  stand. The decorations are hilarious. Overall it is a really fun place. The food was kind of pricey, the burgers start at $10 for a single and it was not that great. The burger was cold and just not special, it might have just been a bad night. Despite crappy food, I still gave this place five stars,  because it was a blast!"}
{"text":"Tracy the manager is beyond rude. They refused to serve  a burger with just the bacon and the cheese. It was terrible!!! The attitude was ridiculous and the drink prices were sky high."}
{"text":"Hrmm...had to try it. Cheesy. It was either this place or the healthy Mediterranean place across the way. Pssh...I'm in Vegas betch.  We were \"admitted\" to this place and given a hospital gown and bracelet. The nurse was hot, so was the doctor. This sounds like the beginning of some smut film. Our nurse sat us down and I felt like I was in the looney bin.  Some folks were getting shots in syringes, wine in bags, and paddles to their caboose. All very strange and quite entertaining.   We ordered a single bypass burger, which we split because they don't split the bigger burgers. If you don't finish your burger, that's a paddling. Burger toppings are limited, possibly to deter people from getting all fancy. When the burger and fries arrived they just looked sloppy. And I'm all for a sloppy burger, but it looked disgusting. Definitely not the best burger I've had. It was actually pretty bland considering it had chili on it. I realized that I was basically paying for the ambience. I washed it down with a Mexican Coke and took some candy cigarettes to go.  Now that I've done it I won't be back here."}
{"text":"This is a unique burger experience, that is for sure. But unique does not necessarily equal positive. I mean, it's really cool that there's a huge scale outside where you can weigh yourself 24/7 (the scale weighs heavy, by the way).  And wacky rules like, if you weigh over 350 lbs you eat for free.   But if your homeless and hungry, I guess not. Sad. But okay. It's a business not a soup kitchen. I digress...  Upon entry you are fitted with a hospital gown and wrist band. The servers are all referred to, and dressed as, doctors and nurses. And the menu is set up that way as well (triple bypass burger, flatliner fries, etc.).   The burger was huge, and I only went with the simple \"single bypass.\" But it had very little flavor. Same with the fries. I had a water and it was outstanding!  So for the kitschy experience, I'd say everyone should come do it at least once. But once was probably enough for me.   Oh and just one final suggestion: weigh yourself before you go in. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"More of a bombastic novelty tourist attraction, rather than a restaurant, I was expecting more.  This place is very gimmicky and could be a turn off for some. I seen a lot of this restaurant in the news and with all of the controversy surrounding this place I had to satisfy my morbid curiosity.  I had the Quadruple Bi-pass burger with bacon.  I consider myself a world class eater, but this behemoth gave me a challenge, I finished the meaty mound at probably the gain of 5 pounds and a cost of 10 years off of my life.  On the ride back to my hotel I felt my hand shaking, heart racing and my soul escaping from my body.  The burger was cooked well done and there was no option to have the burger cooked any other style.  The flavor was ok I guess, but you can dip dry wall in butter fat and it would taste good. My beef with this place (pun intended)  is how hokey the whole thing  feels, people get spanked, there is yelling and screaming, and it feels like a forced circus that is just trying a little too hard. This is definitely not feel good food. but if you want to see what all the fuss is about then go for it,  its not going to hurt your wallet only your waist line and arteries."}
{"text":"I heard about this place on TV and when i found out  i was coming to Vegas i made sure i came here to eat. Located at the at the end of the Fremont Street Experience . I loved this place as well as everyone else in my party  the service was great and the food was great .   First  you walk in and you get put in a hospital gown which i thought was way to funny ,the waitress are dressed up as nurses and the bartenders are the doctors pretty cool . there are mixed reviews about this place but everyone has there opinion the burgers were very juicy and had a good taste not dry at all the fries were also good especially since they are fried in lard i had my concerns of them being super soggy and like greasy but i was very wrong .  I  ordered the double bypass burger with cheese and my husband ordered the double bypass with bacon and these burgers were no joke they were huge . we ordered a Butterfat milkshake it was SO yummy and so creamy and even had a cube a butter  and a mini Hershey bar as well it was a experience for me with this milk shake .  They are a cash only restaurant  but they sell beer and wine and frozen drinks . i thought it was cool the nurses aka our waitress took our order on there IPHONE . The staff were great they took pictures with us and of the group as well . Yes it may be a healthy spot but what burger joint isn't unhealthy lol . Anyway my next Vegas trip hubby wants to come back  so that what i will do"}
{"text":"No standards at this food business at all. Too dirty to consume and so many grams of trans fat. It is more about themselves and doing bad intentions more than caring for customers. Honestly, my relative did not feel good on his stomach. I would personally avoid coming here. Some of the images are fairly offensive."}
{"text":"The Worst customer service experience I have ever encountered.  We entered, got our gowns, sat down and ordered.  While waiting, I had a hot flash moment (menopause) and had taken my arms out of the gown and was fanning myself. One of the \"Nurses\" came over and said, \"you have to put your gown back on,\" I said, I'm having a hot flash, she said you have to put your gown back on.  I said I will once my hot flash subsides.  She left, but shortly after that another \"Nurse\" came over and started reaching towards me as if she was going to try to put the gown back on me, and said you have to put the gown back on, per my manager. I told her she better not touch me and to send the manager over. At this point our group was so put off by the behavior of the 2 women, we decided to leave. Before going, my husband spoke to the manager and told her what had a happened. She apologized, but that didn't make up for the other two women who approached me initially & who acted like they were the hospital gown police and had no regard or didn't understand what a hot flash was. Their tone and actions towards me, was out of line and unacceptable. We are locals and definitely will not return or even recommend this place to anyone based on the actions of the staff tonight"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.   We had great customer service. The \"nurses\" were very friendly, attentive and helpful. Yes, its one of those, \"try once and never come back\" places but worth a try once. Everything cooked in lard is very unappealing. The burgers weren't half bad cept I Dont like chili. Fries were pretty good. They're more like in n out fries rather than McDonalds crunchy fries, though....and also cooked in lard.   Cash only!"}
{"text":"I did not care for this flavorless burger joint! there are better burger places in Vegas that have way better food! I gave this place two stars because the women dressed as naughty nurses are somewhat entertaining, but you better finish your untasty meal or they will give you a whooping!"}
{"text":"What can I say? My eight year old son has wanted to go here forever. We finally went for his eighth birthday on Monday. Our waitress was blah, wife was not happy with her at all. The table next to us had the upbeat waitress who made things exciting! Anyway, we ordered our food which consisted of burgers, fries and onion rings, what came out was the driest meat I have ever tasted. Now I know what they do with the used pucks from the Golden Knights hockey practice! The only thing that was half way decent was the onion rings! So after all was said and done,  I had choked my burger down, my son ate half, daughter had one bite and the wife had two bites. I took the uneaten burgers to go and gave them to some fellers outside who were happy for the meal. At least I didn't feel that I wasted eighty bucks on crap! Also they don't even validate parking! If you feel the need to go there, save a few bucks and look at the food on-line and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Gotta say I think the yelp rating is a bit low. 3.5-4 is more appropriate. You can't deduct points for the schtick because you know it's there before you go so on to the food.  How many patties with or without bacon and fries is your choice. Keeps it simple. Beers are 24 oz and cold. Food arrives quickly and service is attentive. Many video screens with mostly 90's music videos to watch while waiting. Burgers are quite good, no complaint except possibly too much cheese. Fries are nice but expected a bit more flavor from the lard. Milkshake is very tasty yet pure fat. Between the 2 of us we ate about 20% of the shake. Prices were reasonable and we were pretty happy about the whole experience. Would return next time to Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is ....alright for burgers. I mean, the real hype is whether or not you have the confidence to finish the bypass burgers so that you don't get an ass whooping. But other than that, the burgers and things are...ehh."}
{"text":"Ahh what to say about this place. I've always wanted to try it because it seemed like it would be a cool place to eat. First they only accept cash which is pretty lame since my boyfriend and I barely even carry cash on us, second we asked for water and she brought us bottled water we asked for tap and our server said they didn't have any. What kinda bs is that. The burger was nothing fancy just a basic patty onions and tomato and bun. Tasted pretty plain. The hotdog was really big that actually had some pretty good flavor to it we ordered the chili on the side because the menu photo did not make it look appealing at all (it looked like diarrhea on food). Our server never once came to check on us just to take the order and give us the check. Bad service. I would not recommend this place to anybody. Over priced and plain food."}
{"text":"Vegas tradition,  Not that the place is the finest, or healthiest, it's the experience.  From wearing a hospital gown to getting spanked it all seems soo unreal!  Food is a bit pricey but you definitely get what you pay for. Huge portions and the idea of being \"spanked\" if you do not finish you food makes it more exhilarating.  Girls are nice, food is always prepared fairly fast. CASH ONLY.   ps  Each time we come i request for my brother to be spanked, not because he doesnt finish his food but because why not get spanked while in VEGAS. (the nurses take spanking SERIOUS and are not easy on anyone)"}
{"text":"The worst possible food. BK makes a better burger. All gimmick no substance. If the Dr Spent as much time on the food as he does on the gimmick the food could possibly be better.   Otherwise look thru the window and get a good laugh."}
{"text":"I ate hear and the waitresses were cute but looked like they were on strung out on meth. The burger was good for the first 2 bites then the taste became very monotonous, I would not go here again."}
{"text":"Honestly the burgers were mediocre (delicious at first if you're starving!), my friend and I were definitely not feeling so great afterwards because of how much we ate.  Our 'nurse' made our night though.  She was friendly and not fake at all.  I felt some of the others serving that night weren't as enthusiastic or enjoying their job so I enjoyed our experience at this establishment.  If you eat a burger, don't go past 2 patties =)... and don't order fries because you will not reach the fries LOL... Oh gosh I came here from eating little throughout the day and it was NOT a good idea hahah..."}
{"text":"Very entertaining. You have to wear hospital gowns when you enter and its pretty much all hospital themed inside. Finish your food or else you get spanked lol. Cash only which was the only downfall."}
{"text":"This place is nothing but fun. You get into the hospital theme gown and the waitress treats you like her patient. It was our first time at the heart attack grill and we would definitely go back. The food is really yummy  huge portions almost thought I wasn't going to finish but I didn't want to get a spanking ;)  Our waitress was Lola and she was wonderful. Don't think about it just go you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Such a fun place and the burgers are delicious!! I went on a business trip with the guys and we had a blast. I want to come back really soon!!"}
{"text":"The concept is cool, but the food was below average.  I first heard about this place a few years ago on the Travel Channel. At the time, the location was somewhere in Arizona. I got the single burger with cheese. So bland! Tasted some of my husband's fries and it made me frown. Fremont area offers better options. Remember cash only. Be prepared to feel like a child because they also force you to wear a hospital gown too."}
{"text":"Worth checking out, at least once!  It's definitely decked out with the hospital theme - and the customers get involved with it: you have to wear a hospital gown!   There's so much to look at, that you don't know where to focus.  You have the option to sign up for a serious paddlin' in front of everyone - there's a camera that records your facial expressions and of course, your friends can film you as well!    If you weigh 350lbs+ you get a free meal; however, you weigh-in right in the middle of the restaurant, the weight displayed for everyone to see."}
{"text":"Better than I expected!  For a burger, fries, and shake in Vegas, I paid less that I thought I was going to.  The burger was good. The low-priced addition of MANY strips of bacon was a good call. The fries were meh... I was expecting more, but they were just ok.  The gold though, is their shakes. I had a vodka cookie dough shake. Hands down best shake I've ever had.  For being a big gimmick, this place was a pretty good deal with good food. The only reason I'm coming back though is for the shakes."}
{"text":"Fun experience, but the burgers are more like meatloaf patties very dense. In our group the chili dog and onion rings were the best food items."}
{"text":"With a 350 pounds and over eat free and a Massive 12000 calorie burger, this is the stuff of legend.  The Ultimate PIG-OUT Spot, No Joke!  All you can eat French Fry Bar, Burgers cooked with lard, Shakes made with Butter fat (WTH), Holy Crap.  This place is intimidating and almost frightening.  Tip for all first timers, start with a single bypass burger and work your way up.  Everything was Tasty but I should of stayed away from the Milkshake.  A great place for a laugh and a very friendly staff, but a Must Try for all Food Junkies!"}
{"text":"This was our 1st trying it! We Loved it. The food was really good, customer service (our nurse/waitress) took great care of us. We just had the regular hamburger but next time we might try the 8 patty burger. You need to try this place at least once. I strongly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place didn't have very many redeeming qualities.. I love the gimmick of weighing yourself first and then after you eat... my daughter loved the Dr.. all the people were very friendly.. but the food was awful..  it made all of us sick including my daughter. Was not happy with their food. Service was great but tl again food was awful."}
{"text":"It was a fun place to go, but the fries were way to salty to even eat and the burger was just alright. It was a fun experience, but it is making me sick and regretting going there. I guess if you are over 350 your body can handle this food a lil easier, but if you're not I would recommend looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"Heart Attack Grill is based on an extremely unique concept, which makes it a very interesting restaurant.  When I first walked in a nurse helped check me & my friends in. She put hospital gowns on us along with the hospital bracelets, which stated something about a bypass.   There is ABSOLUTELY nothing healthy on the menu. The menu consists of burgers, shakes, coke, fries, and water. I ordered the single bypass, since I'm not much of red meat girl, with fries and a coca cola.  Overall, the burger was delicious, but I found the fries to be okay. The potatoes here are fried in pure lard in order to make the fries. They looked a little burnt and didn't taste as amazing as I thought they would be. They weren't that fresh either.  The service is okay... nothing out of the ordinary.  I would come back here again just because you can't find a place like this anywhere else in the country.  WARNING: If you don't finish your entire burger they will spank you."}
{"text":"The environment was nice, and the workers at the entrance were really friendly. The burger was tasty, but a little pricy, and I had to pay about $1.50 just for water. Our inexperienced, hard-of-hearing, unfriendly waitress (Victoria, according to the receipt) put bacon on our burgers when we said no bacon and told us we didn't order fries when we clearly did. She was also on her phone a lot. Very unprofessional. At least she took a couple bucks off the bill for messing up.  Also this must be the only restaurant in Downtown Las Vegas that doesn't accept credit/debit cards. At least their ATM machine was only $.75."}
{"text":"Very upset with the service I received from one of the host/nurses this past Monday night. Very rude and snobby!  I must say though.. The milkshakes are DELICIOUS!!!!"}
{"text":"I honestly do not know how far hospitality goes for many people but being in the culinary/restaurant industry and boyfriend in the customer service industry I expected some kind of courtesy. Also, I never write comments but this had to be said.  Earlier this evening (10/1), I went there with my boyfriend and daughter. We we at the \"f*ck it, lets try it out\" point, can't go wrong with burgers and fries. Looking on the outside vinyl at specials and prices for the burgers. The menu with prices were on the inside so we walk right in and look at the menu. Not even 30 seconds of being there or even getting a full look at the menu, the host, notices we have an outside drink, and asks us to step outside to finish them before coming back in. We literally just walked in the door and the boyfriend said after being asked to leave \"oh ok, no problem, we just wanted to look at the menu\" During mid sentence of my boyfriend saying that, the host replies \"sir, outside. You are not allowed outside drinks in here\" I look at him with an \"are you serious look\" while trying to look at the menu at the same time but it is also hard with holding a hungry 2 year old. Moving forward, not being there for even a minute, we start turning around while still trying to look at the menu. We are very respectful in obeying the \"no outside food or drink\" rule in an establishment but as soon as the host said \"Sir, Ma'am. The door is right there. You can look at the menu from outside\" I flipped but in a professional manner.   First, I asked him where the sign was for no outside food/drinks, there was none or he didn't know where it was because we obviously didn't see it. Then he goes on with attitude, I might add, of how disrespectful I'm being towards him and how rude I am? I still had my 2 year old, who has been up all day and eating was our last stop before home.  Second, there were guys inside staring at the menu with beer in their hands, which was obviously from outside but I don't hear him telling them to look at the menu from outside. All we had was a half full soda while these guys had a full on beer, each.  Lastly, of course I wanted to speak to their manager about their hosts' customer service skills but the host didn't want to go get them. I could have made the scene worse but I didn't bother, we finally left. The entrance was small and crowded for 7 guys, me, a 2 year old and a host.  I honestly thought this was Dick's for the brief minute we were there."}
{"text":"For the price they serve a ton of food.  $10 for a double ($1+extra for bacon 10 slices on the double). Each burger is 1/2 lb of meat.... You can order from a single to an octuple!  Be wary of the size you order as they do spank you for not finishing your burger, unless you enjoy that kind of thing.   This place is a complete over the top representation of exactly what it claims to be with the name Heart Attack Grill  Over-sized,  over-fattened food.   It is completely about the fun and atmosphere and I enjoyed it completely.   When you go make sure you take the right attitude, the right appetite,  and cash (there is an atm)."}
{"text":"This place is loads of fun! Order wisely here! Even their single burger is really big! The food is tasty. I got a white wine IV bag that I shared with my friend. A whole bottle fits in there. We also did the jello syringe shots which were really yummy."}
{"text":"I was not prepared for how big these damn burgers are, no wonder people get spanked.  The chili cheese fries were delicious.  The burger was pretty good nothing amazing but good.  We killed our food the coke from the glass bottle was perfect.  I couldn't even eat a shake I was too full.  A single is ample food you have got to be crazy to go bigger or extremely hungry.  They greet you in the front and put on a robe which is cool cuz it can get messy.  The waitresses were all nice although I heard this place has toned down a lot from its days in Arizona.  Nurse Stephanie was awesome we exchanged a ton of jokes and laughs.  We even did the jello shots.  We had a great time sitting at the bar and observing.  I would go back!!"}
{"text":"Ughhhh I walked out of this restaurant with a sick and heavy feeling in my stomach.  I'm sorry stomach, never again!  My friend ordered the quadruple bypass, and I ordered the single.  The single was way more than enough lard and meat for me.  Just to complete the whole experience we ordered the flat liner fries too.  BAD CHOICE.  The first one was tasty, the ones that followed started tasting more like soggy potatoes dipped in lard.    The quad was just pure insanity and my friend finished it.  D: He liked it but I was on the side ready to jump up if any CPR was needed.  The ambiance was cute.  Nurse waiters and waitresses, clever movie posters that parody the grill, and patient gowns for everyone!    Artery clogging food is definitely the main game of this place.  If you really want to have a myocardial infarction, eat here."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the entire experience. If you are interested in visiting this location just make sure you have a slight \"opened mind\" in the least. Eat all your food (or don't) and you'll have a great time. Kind of want to go back tonight but the rational part of me says I probably shouldn't : ) next time I'm in Vegas though!"}
{"text":"This is a cash only place. I had the double burger, which was too much for me. Should have had the single. The fries were ok, the burger patty was bland. Basically, I will not come back for the food, it's ok at best. If this helps in comparison, there are far better burgers at Carl's Jr. The side show would be the only reason to return but only if I'm with someone who has not been there. If you don't finish your meal, you get spanked with a paddle by the waitress. There were plenty of guys not finishing (I'm sure many on purpose) and being spanked. I could not finish because I ordered too much and I passed on the spanking. I'm not willing to get spanked for great food, and the food is far from great. Some of them regretted it, because a few waitresses showed no mercy. Service was friendly, but this place could be alot better if the food was good."}
{"text":"I've heard, read and seen stories of this eatery.  Now having experienced it, I can say, it was entertaining and energetic.  Our nurse was friendly, helpful and amazingly beautiful.  Our party of five was served good food with great drinks.  One of our group felt it necessary to order a quint. bypass burger with bacon and fries.  No, he did not finish it.  As punishment, our nurse lined all 5 of us up on the barstools and gave us butt bruises.  It was fun for all but a couple of us.  Sitting is now a luxury.  One tip, this is a cash only establishment.  If you like a fun time and amature karaoke, stop by."}
{"text":"This was my third time here......the service is great....the food is not for the health minded, and that is how it is advertised. It is is fun, but do not let the waitresses paddle your ass! Those cute little gals swing like Babe Ruth! We had chili dogs....they are huge....had the vodka chocolate shake..OUTSTANDING.........fun time here every time!"}
{"text":"3 stars just because it is an interesting concept and they have a cool interior.  If i were rating strictly on the food, at best they would get 2 stars.    Service was okay, not particularly stellar.  They do make you agree to the \"rules\" before you are allowed into the restaurant.  The milk shake was the best part of the meal, and i am not a big fan of ice cream or milkshakes in general.  The burger (a single bypass with bacon) was huge, but tasteless.  The onion rings were doughy and undercooked.  The hot dog one of our party ordered was huge, and probably the biggest success of the meal.  We saw three individuals weigh in over 350 pounds during our meal, which was enough to make me lose my appetite.  I only managed 4 bites of the burger, but got out without a spanking.  It's fun to say we've been here, but certainly won't go back, and i can only recommend it based on the kitschy idea."}
{"text":"Lol. This is a real place, located within the Fremont Experience area. Per the sign, anyone 350lbs or more eats for free. SMH. They sale burgers galore and all of the waitress wear nurse uniforms. Burgers are great and staff are inviting. A must visit place."}
{"text":"Gross, gross, gross! If they spent as much money as they did on the decor as they did their food it might be a better Burger you can definitely tell the patties came from frozen meat, the french fries were very low budget Costco french fries with no flavor the bottle sodas weren't enough quench your thirst,the decor is way outdated not to mention it was dirty. Best part was it was cheap, cash only!"}
{"text":"We went on September 1st.  It's a nice gimmick restaurant with overpriced food.  I guess you could do it once to say you did it, but I would never go back.  It is cash only.  You would be better off to eat at In and Out, and use the money you saved for the buffet at Caesers."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this restaurant.  The food is okay, but not as good as advertised.  The theme is okay and most of the staff are friendly.  However, the overall experience is not worth the time.  It is a cash only establishment.  And the management is NOT will to be accommodating if there is an error or something wrong with your order.  I was unhappy with a drink which was recommended by the waitress.  When I ask to change the drink, the waitress and the manager both refused.  I thought it was a little strange, but whatever.  Then the burger ended being a bit over rated.  If you want a good burger, go to Gordon Ramsey's Burgr.  I have tried that too and its great!"}
{"text":"???????????????????????????? ??????????????????????? ????????????????????????  ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????ww ????????????? ???????????????????????????????????? ???????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????????  ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ????????????????????????????????????????? ???????????????????????????? ????????????????????????????????????????? ????????????????? ???????????  ?????????????????????"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and the overall gimmick of the place is great. I recommend you try this place once for the experience. The food is good, the burgers, hotdogs, & chilie cheese fries are all well prepared with good flavor. Just be careful with the portions, there isn't a small meal on the menu. If u order too much food & don't finish it they paddle u in front of the whole restaurant."}
{"text":"This experience was awesome! I've never seen a Burger Restaurant like this before.  First of all, we have been there for Vacation.  We saw on a German TV Show this Restaurant and we thought we should visit it.   If you enter the Restaurant a sexy Nurse will give you an scrub. When you choose an Burger, watch out. Because if you don't eat them completely, the sexy Nurse will spank your Ass! So I choose a Single By-Pass Burger and my husband chooses the Double By-Pass Burger and together we tried the Flatliner Fries with Chili and Cheese. It tastes all good, but it was not mind-blowing.  For the rest of the day we have had enough.  The Decoration in this Location was very detailed and cool and if your weight is over 350lb, you can eat for free (Not me)."}
{"text":"So this is kind of a novelty place...I didn't know that when I went in there.  The skanky nurses (waitresses) make you wear hospital gowns as a bib.  They don't serve any sort of \"healthy\" food at all (no veggies or diet drinks).  The burgers themselves were great, but I really like the french fries the most.  Kind of expensive, but a fun choice if you're in the area."}
{"text":"You go to Heart Attack Grill for the experience and not necessarily to get the best burger of your life. We were on Fremont roaming around starved and there was a line out the door because of how notorious this place is. Weigh 350 pounds and eat free? Come on!!! You can even embarrass yourself outside with their massive scale.  Instead of waiting for a table, we sat at the bar which cut our wait time. You get to wear a lovely hospital gown and look a complete mess, but whatever. The menu is hilariously gross; only vegan option is cigarettes and you can get an octuple bypass with 40 slices of bacon. You read both of those right.   Boyfriend and I both had the single bypass, shared a side of fries, and a beer. We should have split a single as I could barely finish 1/3 of it. Oddly enough, that's the only burger you can split; can't split anything larger. Burger lacked flavor to me, even with bacon and chili on it. I did love the bun and the fries were great with my mayonnaise coating (self inflicted). For dessert, because I wasn't fat enough, got the strawberry milkshake. I was in heaven it was so good! I could have lived without the frozen butter on top; didn't add anything but a gross bite and overthetopness.   Creme de la creme of this place is watching gross dudes who have been oogling the waitresses in nurse costumes all night clamoring to get spanked by a paddle.  They say you get spanked for not finishing your burger, but I'm pretty sure it was anyone who asked for it got it. I didn't finish mine, so maybe they lay low with the ladies.  Was it a fun experience while in Vegas? Sure. Would I go back? No.  Oh, and it's cash only."}
{"text":"COOL, FUN, PLACE. FOOD SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have had better burgers at Denny's. The fries were cold and tasteless. They take CASH ONLY and I know why, the prices are a joke.  Walk in look around then go some place else to eat."}
{"text":"Really fun food joint, but not the best tasting food, although as expected you get a huge amount. The atmosphere is really cool though, lots of custom memorabilia and even the menus and paintings are a work of art. Heart Attack Grill is the satire of all American fast food places. If I can recommend any of the foods, the onion rings are really nice."}
{"text":"This is not my kind of place at all, but my husband insisted on trying it so off we went. I wanted a milkshake, but saw someone walk by with one that literally had butter on it. I went with water. We each tried a burger, and while my husband thoroughly enjoyed his, I found it to lack anything special about it to make it worth the price they charge and it was far larger than I needed even with just one patty. The drink options were amusing- the IV bag and syringe were fun, and the syringe drink actually tasted good. Service was friendly, which is better than I can say about a lot of places in Vegas. The decor was cute as well. For a one-time trip to make my husband happy it was fine but it's not worth a second trip for me."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and experience I thought was definitely fun and a must, at least once! I see all the posts about the burgers not being good but the day we went they were good not gourmet but good. I tasted a friends since I myself ordered the chili cheese dog and that was really good. I didn't order my own fries or onion rings cause if I had I would have gotten spanked!! I tasted the greasers and they weren't bad but they weren't great. If you thought you can go into a place called Heart Attack Grill and order diet food and diet cokes then you really should have visited their website. It says Cash only, it says exactly what they have on their menu and the whole concept of the place."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Vegas, one of my guy friends suggested we try Heart Attack Grill. Wait, let me reiterate, he INSISTED we eat there. I hadn't heard of it before and didn't know what to expect. We arrived about 9pm ish.   Outside of the restaurant there is a huge scale that entices drunk people to weigh themselves for all of Freemount St. to see. There's also a neon sign saying if you weigh 350lbs or more you eat for free. Foregoing getting on the scale, we walked in and was immediately accosted by \"nurses\" in tight & revealing uniforms, who put us in hospital gowns and gave us \"hospital wrist bands\". Now I know why my friend wanted to come here, the nurses....not to worry girls, the \"doctors\" are equally hot.  Stephanie was our server and she was really friendly. There were 6 of us. Everyone ordered the Single By-Pass Burger with a side of fries except for one who decided on the ginormous Chili Dog. While looking at the menu, it said if you didn't finish your menu, the nurses would spank you. Deciding I didn't want to get spanked, my friend and I decided to share the single. We ordered a couple of shakes to share. Wasn't too keen on the calorie count it claimed but, it was pretty good.   We also ordered the peniscillin Jell-O shots. It actually comes out in the shape of a....., well, I'll pass on the graphics and let your imagination go to the dark place. The peniscillin shot is filled with white jello and is like a needle shot you'd get at the doctors's office. Let's just say they aren't served in glasses, you shoot it in your mouth. I would've posted pics but I'll keep this G-rated.   The food was nothing special, it's just a burger loaded with bacon and a ton of calories. It was cooked to my liking and I'm so glad I shared with my friend because I could barely finish it.   My friend who ordered the chili dog wasn't able to finish his. I pointed out that he was about to get his booty spanked...woot woot and he literally started getting nervous. I actually didn't think they'd spank people but it was fun teasing the drunk guy. He tried to get us to help him but we refused. He tried swapping his basket with another friend who had finished his meal. I reminded him Stephanie would probably remember he ordered the chili dog since he's the only one who ordered it on our table. He said there was no way they would spank customers and was probably a gimmick. Well, what do you know, at that very moment, we hear \"pack, pack, pack\" and people cheering. A guy was getting spanked! And the nurse wasn't spanking him gently either!  Our friend seriously panicked and started grabbing everyone's basket and trying to hide his unfinished meal. It was hilarious. He was begging us not to tell our waitress. I really wanted to see him get spanked. Guess you had to be there cuz it was very funny seeing him sweating. When the check came, he threw some money on the table and bolted out the door....wuss.  The ambience is retro themed, like a novelty fast food burger joint, with hospital decorations. There are a lot of seatings with music playing in the back ground. There's also a scale inside and a few big guys got on it and what do you know, they weigh more than 350 lbs. one guy who I think was their friend was 3 lbs shy. The patrons cheered and were engaging. Maybe because we went late at night, when everyone is \"feeling good\" the place seemed alive.   For me Heart Attack Grill is a one time deal, just to say, I've been there, done that. Don't expect the most amazing burgers. Go there for the novelty.   Service was spot on and super friendly, the reason for the 4 star rating.   I think the hospital gowns they give you are freshly laundered because when we left we put it in a laundry basket.   As many Yelpers have stated, they take cash only. So keep this on mind. It's also kid friendly."}
{"text":"The heart attack grill is nothing more than a tourist attraction. A very poor tasting one at that. The burgers and fries have no real flavor. Burger patties lathered with lard and cooked on a flat top stove so the patties are dripping in pure fat. The fries also fried in pure lard have so much fat in them that they taste soggy. Soggy fat. Sounds delicious don't it? The owner makes light of a very serious addiction in this country. Food addiction is just as real and just as deadly as any other addiction. The owner let's people that weigh more than 350 pounds eat free. Why free? So their gluttony will eventually kill them. To this day 3 people have had a heart attack IN the restaurant. Among those 3 was his unofficial spokesman that ate at Heart Attack Grill for free every day and died. So go to Heart Attack Grill put on your dirty hospital gown, pay for an overpriced disgusting meal and enjoy what might possibly be..... your last meal."}
{"text":"This was my first time in Vegas and me my wife and two year old son decided on the last day of the memorial weekend we would check out the Fremont downtown strip. We looked at the heart attack grill and thought WOW what a cool place to eat. BOY WAS I WRONG!. We had to wait over 20 Min's just to be seated which was OK because the place was busy and a tourist attraction. But after we were seated our waiter messed up a large groups order so it took him 20 Min's to even notice us. After we flagged him down he made us wait another five Min's then finally took our order. He brought our \"water\" $1.84 a piece because they don't offer free water and then placed our order. The waiter checked in on us 10 Min's later assuring us that we would get our order in five minutes but by this time he took another group of 15 foot ball players. so we had to wait for him to take all their orders and while it was taking a long time another waitress had to bring over the order for us.  I ordered a double bypass and my wife ordered a single by pass. Both our burgers were dry and burnt my wife took three bites of her burger and she then said that this was enough. I only took one bite of mine. WE DECIDED TO GETUP AND LEAVE. I told the waiter that his service was horrible and that we were not going to pay. He then ran to the bar counter where the manager was and began to tell him the situation. This guy dressed as the head doctor pretty much said well this is the way that they are made and there is no way that we would get our money back because we ate the food. I told him that this was BS. he then threatened me to call the Security and I had to pay for it or go to jail for a Misdemeanor. I told him to take off half the food and paid for something I didn't enjoy.  Moral of the story kids is if you want to be treated badly and have a long wait and over pay then go to this place but if your looking for at least one star service then don't come here at all save your money. We went across the street to the Irish pub and they gave us another burger and even gave us free soda because we were treated badly. I give this place the big TWO THUMBS DOWN~!"}
{"text":"We went there on our honeymoon and it was an enjoyable experience .kinda fun putting on the gowns and talking to the nurse. So overall the experience of it was pretty fun got to watch a guy weigh in and since he weighed over 350 bells and lites went off cause his meal was gonna be free! The nurses were friendly and all had good sense of humor! But the food was not good at all burger was tasteless ,chili was freaking terrible fries were soggy and disgusting. Prolly won't go back but we did buy a paddle"}
{"text":"We ate there twice.  The first time, we had chili on our burgers and fries.  The chili is nasty so the 2nd time we were there, no chili.  The burgers are great!!!  The onion rings will serve 2 people! The double had my almost 300 lb son crying like a baby LOL - he did get a spanking not because he didn't finish his meal (he did) but because the rest of us didn't and we put our food on his plate when his \"nurse\" wasn't looking.  She gave him 3 whacks for that! :)  The wait staff is excellent and super nice!  You cannot order anything to go and all orders must be paid in cash only (they have an ATM on site with a $1.95 fee - the hotel ATM fee is $5.00 FYI)."}
{"text":"Unusual and fun atmosphere with a cute concept. The fries were okay, but the rest of the food was awful. We expected a great burger, but it was one of the worst I have had. I would stop in for a look, but recommend eating somewhere else."}
{"text":"The burgers aren't that awesome but I think most people go there for the atmosphere, which is pretty cool. You will get spanked or sing karaoke if you do not finish your food. The chili cheese fries are good too (they're made with lard) and people over 350 lbs eat for free! Also no diet drinks."}
{"text":"This was a big disappointment!!  As soon as we get in the door there are two nurses there that were supposed to greet us but decided to stare at us instead. After the party in front of us was seated we finally received some acknowledgement by these two nurses holding up dingy worn out wrinkled faded used gowns which I put on against my will. Then the waitress moved into the dining area about five feet and sat us right behind some professional video gear apparently they are filming a TV show documentary! At this point no one has explained what this restaurant is all about or what the video is all about.    We are left to figure it all out on our own! So at this point we are very skeptical but we venture ahead anyway. We receive our menus and where very confused because there is nothing to it small medium or large that's it? Fries, soda, and beer! At this point I am looking around for the comment card but cannot find one! So from this point on it only gets worse.  So the food arrives and to our surprise there is nothing to it at all. Actually my bun was bigger than my burger with no sauce it was not juicy dripping with fat it was actually dry and over cooked cheap piece of meat in a bun 1.5 times too small for the bun.  So I ordered a milk shake why not! Soon after filming a scene started which was flagged of behind us through a diffused panel. The music was shut off too so no ambient music playing as everyone crowded around near our table to watch a cute skinny girl try and gobble down 4pounds of burger. So I had to wait until filming was done to get my milk shake while the restaurant watched us wait for our food watching this skinny girl try and do the do!  The waitresses are just not into it noir was I at this point. So the last thing that upset me was that when the bill came I threw my card on the table. The waitress says that we are cash only? This made me mad because they failed to explain anything to us the whole time we were there. She even had the nerve to say yeah we have a sign up front that says so.   As a patron I felt cheated out of the experience in every way possible. They left me nothing to recommend nothing except regret!   I will now rate the food on a scale of 1-10 I give a 4.5 unseasoned meat, overcooked and dry. Not even close to a heart attack. The fries are undesirable, too soggy straight from a heat lamp or something. The milk shake was ok I guess but had no desire to finish it based on the other events I was just  not in to it anymore.  The service was a 5 Basically this is setup on hype and cannot deliver on what it promises."}
{"text":"I have tried this place a couple of times. Once to eat and once to drink. The food is very average and you are paying more for the reputation of being on man vs food, etc. It is definitely an experience to eat here and we thought it was a unique idea with the size of the burgers and the stick of butter in the milkshakes, etc. On the other hand when we came in later to drink on a separate trip I didn't care for the staff. We are in Vegas to have fun and let loose. Instead we had the bartender who was having a bad night and decided to take it out on the customers. I felt we were under the microscope and she was looking for us to step out of line to release her built up frustration. With so much competition downtown you have to cater to people having fun and not rain on our parade! My advice is to remind your staff they are in the people business and if they only got into it just for the tips regardless of service and attitude they are in the wrong line of work..."}
{"text":"One time is all you need. Burger is ok. Shakes are better than average. Sodas are dismal. Way over priced. Tacky and not my idea of fun to watch folks getting spanked for over ordering. Generally I recommend going elsewhere."}
{"text":"I had so much fun here great experience. Unfortunately i wasnt able to eat all my food so I had to get up there and do karaoke I definitely will be back to watch some of my friends get spanked really enjoy the thing really enjoyed the shots very cool restaurant a must-try"}
{"text":"We came here because my friend weighs 354 and so he got to eat free. From the minute we stepped inside it was rush, rush, rush. Our server quickly went over the menu and was leaning on my menu so I couldn't even see it. I asked her if we could have a minute but she gave me a look and said, \"why? I just told you the menu\". So I said \"Ok I'll just take a water\" to make her go away. She then says I would have to buy a bottled water or an alcoholic drink because that's all they have. At this point I was so turned off by her service I didn't want to pay her a penny for a glass of water. And being 16 weeks pregnant there weren't any drink options for me. My friend said the burger was average, and none of us liked how we were treated. Definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, huge portions, simple menu, great concept for marketing their business. The nurses smack you with a paddle if you don't finish your burger Lol!"}
{"text":"Ok so what do I say about the heart attack grill?  Well I'll start by saying that this is a very touristy place, it isn't somewhere you would choose to go to every day of the week if you were a local lol  When you enter you are greeted by a guy in medical scrubs who leads you to a little dressing area where you are given hospital patient gowns to put on, then you are led by a waitress dressed as a nurse to your table.  The nurse then gives you your (very limited) menu, the options are a 1/2 pound hot dog with chilli and cheese or the burgers-you can go for the single burger with cheese and chilli or you can opt to go big and choose the double or triple burgers with extra bacon and cheese and chilli!   Oh did I mention that whatever you choose to order you MUST finish? If you don't you will be taken my your nurse waitress to the middle of the restaurant and spanked with a large wooden paddle!! Lol  So I decided to play it safe and opted for the single burger with chilli and cheese and believe me I am glad I did as I struggled to even finish this-but I did :)   The food is as it sounds....greasy, fatty and extremely salty so the heart attack grill is the perfect name for this place, I could feel my arteries clogging as I ate lol   Anyways this place is not for everyday dining but if you are visiting Las Vegas for a holiday, this is a must try place-such a laugh and it's a story to tell!  The only reason I didn't give this any more than 3 stars is down the food-it was the greasiest burger I've ever had to eat and I don't think I would have finished it if it wasn't for fear of a spanking lol"}
{"text":"This place is a tourist trap of food destruction.  You will have to wear a medical gown if you go in.  You will get beat with a wooden paddle, not a light spanking if you cannot finish your burger.  The waitresses dressed like nurses take joy in doing a running 270 degree softball pitch like paddle swing in the middle of the restaurant for the joy of all other patrons while the poor people who cannot finish their burgers stare into an iPad taking a selfie of them being punished. This place was better than Steak Shack and the food is huge.  The double burger I had was the biggest I ever saw.  The patties are half pound pre-cook. The fries are good, shakes are awesome, I just will not order more than 1 side next time for me and the wife - it is too much food.  The decor is amazing by the way and really creative!!!"}
{"text":"I saw the Heart Attack Grill on television and knew they had scantily clad nurses and lard induced food. What you don't realize is the restaurant is really going for more than the lard version of Hooters.  They want to give you the feeling that you are eating in a strip club.  By that, I'm not suggesting that the nurses are inappropriate or wearing too little clothing. It's just that you walk in and they have long tables shaped like a bar with stools. It's like a cheap inside joke, they are TRYING to be the ultimate guys hangout: lard burgers and fries, waitresses who are dressed like stripper nurses, no veggies, no diet coke,  all the lard drenched steak fries you can eat, corona's and regular coke served in bottles.    Yeah, I'm fine with all of that and I understand this place is going for that theme.   So in short, the concept is fun but the execution is horrible. Here are the problems  1. Food: the burgers tasted as if they went to Food City and bought the cheapest meat they could buy and dump it in some lard. The lard didn't not make the food taste any different with the exception that I felt really full and heavy at the end of my meal. The food was very disappointing.   2. Scantilly clad women in nurses outfits are fine as long as the women wearing the outfits are attractive. That wasn't the case here. They are not even Hooters quality in terms of attractiveness.  3. Yes, I want greasy food but I don't want to feel like I'm standing next to the fryer as I eat the food. The floor had so much grease that had condensed from the air that I almost slipped several times. The place had a bad odor and it just stank from the lard. You felt like you were eating in the kitchen.  4. Lack of service: the nurses chat with you and are friendly but they don't serve you. It's like Fudruckers. You get your own fries. You put toppings on your own burger. You fill out your own order/check at the end. The waitress only takes your drink order and points to a wall and aks you to pick out a burger  5. Scary crowd: the people eating at the restaurant reminded me of people on the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. We are talking major rednecks here!  It was mostly middle aged guys sitting by themselves and eating as if they were at a strip club I also saw a bunch of kids eat here and they looked as if they running moonshine between Kentucky and Ohio in the 1920's.  6. No credit cards.  They have an ATM in the place if you lack cash  7. Expensive.  I paid 14 dollars for a beer and a burger.  For the cheap a$#$ environment, you woud think the prices would be less but you"}
{"text":"So a friend brought me here after she had a great time. The food is good and there is absolutely no green stuff here. The environment is fun and everyone is in great spirit.   Upon entering you are given a hospital gown. That instantly puts you in a the mood to chow down. The staff is dressed like nurses. And there's a few people in scrubs. The decorations are hilarious and just add to the scene.  Definitely going to come back here every time I go to Vegas. I order the single bypass burger and fries just to be safe (no spankings over here). But I think I can definitely finish a double bypass the next.   This is a place that you go to with good friends. Laugh, drink and make sure to eat all your food or else."}
{"text":"Funny idea but terrible food, would not recommend.  The strange atmosphere and the smelly robes that you have to wear didn't really help to get you in the right mood for a meal. Like I said, funny idea but I definitely won't go again."}
{"text":"Cash only restaurant, because you could die. A bit intimidating place, but we wanted to try it because it was in the food channel. To get in the restaurant, they let you wear a hospital gown to stick with the hospital theme. Also, the waiters are not that pretty when we came.   Once the food came, one bite of the \"single coronary by-pass\" and I almost threw up! It tasted so gross, the after taste is even worse! They cook the patty with LARD (animal fat). This is the reason why people will actually have a \"heartattack.\" Even the milkshake that my brother ordered had butter as a topping on it. Overall, we were disappointed. Never should have came here, and never coming back to this place EVER."}
{"text":"Cinque stelle per la simpatia e la sugnosità di qualunque cosa uno possa ordinare! Heart Attack è un'istituzione che tutti gli amanti degli hamburger dovrebbero conoscere e propone da sempre una sola sfida: ordinati l'hamburger della dimensione che vuoi ma se non lo finisci verrai sculacciato!  Su questo semplice concetto hanno costruito un business! Quando uno entra viene accolto da delle sexy (alcune lo erano) infermiere che prima ti mettono in camice da paziente e poi ti accompagnano al tavolo. Il menù è talmente allucinante e ben fatto che se sei interessato lo puoi comprare ad un dollaro... io ero interessato :D  Spiccano tra tutto gli hamburger che pur essendo semplici con solo cipolla, bacon, fagioli o qualcosa di simile e una roba piccante che non ho ovviamente messo, hanno la possibilità di essere ingigantiti a dismisura. Per intenderci si può arrivare ad avere un hamburger con nove strati di carne ed una quarantina di strisce di bacon! Unico contro è che qualora tu non finissi la tua ordinazione una delle infermiere ti mette alla gogna e sculaccia con una paletta di legno, anch'essa comprabile a sette dollari... intendo la paletta, eh :) A detta di Ettore ed Arcangelo, entrambi sculacciati di cui uno dei due per scelta, la paletta fa male e la rossa che ci faceva da infermiera sembrava divertirsi un mondo in questo suo secondo lavoro!  Per questo, per le bellissime locandine dei film e perché quel bacon era fottutamente buono non posso che dare cinque stelle all'Heart Attack cinque stelle. Se le meritano tutte!"}
{"text":"The best burger I've had in years. Stuck with the single bypass burger and i almost couldn't finish it. Best part was watching my boyfriend get spanked for leaving a bite of his burger!"}
{"text":"This is a must one time... we had a blast . Group of 8 of us with one of our guys weighing in at 410lbs.. walk in and you get hospital gowns.. our big guy had to go on the karaoke stage and they announced his weight and he got to eat for free on the single patties and fries as long as he ordered a drink... cash only , can only , you must finish what you order or you will be spanked or forced to sing karaoke unless you have someone willing to take your spankings ... we all ordered singles and fries .. they serve your shots in prescription bottles and their beer comes in a can with sexy nurses... burgers were good .. fries were good .. totally worth the price of everything for the experience .."}
{"text":"10/10 for experience. My wife and I went in with about 10 other dudes and I told one of my co-workers that I'd put $15 down toward the burger with 8 patties. He ate 6! And he just about chunked everywhere. Our waitress/naughty nurse was a tennis player in high school and I don't know if I've ever seen anyone hit harder than she did while paddling my co-worker for not finishing his octave bypass burger lol.  The food here is a 7/10, the burger was fine, I'm just so glad I asked for the chili on the side because I've never seen a more oily/gloppy mess than that nasty chili. Overall, anyone needs to go at least once for the experience. Top notch for entertainment!"}
{"text":"I had to make a stopover at the heart attack Grill on the old Vegas Fremont strip. Being a physician, always wanted to play the part of dressing up as the patient and here was my chance. The vibe here was purely fast food diner. Walking in you're greeted by \"nurses\" that robe you up and seat you at the table. Their menu was on the pricey side for a bypass burgers, fries, and drinks but I loved the creativity of the menu!   To name a few wine in IV bags wheeled out on an IV stand, beer cans labeled after -blonde (4/5 -good brew for 6$-I enjoyed it) amber and dark nurse, Jell-O shots in enteral feeding syringes (2/5-at 6$ -do not get the cherry flavoured shot - it had a really bad aftertaste), hard liquor shots in large prescription bottles!   Couldn't comment on food because I didn't have any. However, if you don't finish your food you get smacked in the butt! Fun entertainment!"}
{"text":"Wow I was recommended by this and didnt get a chance to look it up on yelp so when I got here I was shocked of was just out of my expectations. I liked that they did play to the theme a lot. The theme is a hospital type the servers are good looking nurses and the owner is the surgeon. When u walk in you get served and you wear a gown. They also have made up news stories on the TVs talking about there place. Overall it was a different experience so it was good."}
{"text":"A very gimmicky place all they have is cheeseburgers and they are mediocre at best it was worth the experience to go once my wife do not care for it though and we probably will not go back"}
{"text":"Come here for the experience, not the food!  Servers were awesome but food was sub-par. I had the fries and double bypass. Fries and burger had no taste. I asked if I had to finish the fries also to avoid the \"paddle\" but they told me that only the burger needed to be finished. Sucks that they don't let you take home food which you paid cash for if you can't finish your meal. Oh yeah, they don't accept credit cards which is a minus also.   The only fun part was seeing my friend and other patrons get paddled by waitresses dressed in nurse outfits for not finishing their burgers.   Would I come here again? Probably not. Sad to say, McDonalds have tastier burgers than this place."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Meat was blah, fries were blah, but a fun experience.  *If you weigh more then 350 you eat free.  *They only accept cash. *must wear gown and bracelet Wouldn't come back because the food was nothing special, but a good experience!"}
{"text":"I love this place... girls smack your ass when you don't finish your burger... lol. Friendly service, food was good, atmosphere was fun!"}
{"text":"Wow, I tried, I really did.  But the Double beat me.  This place, like all things in life, are gonna be as fun as you make it.  People who can eat more than the doubles are from another planet.  The double was good and the chili rocked.  My cousin ordered the same with but with bacon and killed it!  Me on the other hand, I gave it my all but came up short and had to suffer the spanks from the Naughty Nurse.  Did I really lose?"}
{"text":"Great Schtick, as a previous reviewer wrote. I don't remember much about the food, frankly (I seem to remember enjoying the onion rings) so it probably wasn't fantastic. But the experience of eating made the visit worth it."}
{"text":"If it was possible to give this place a half of a star, I would. Tacky, unattractive waitresses. Poor concept. And the fact they are actually promoting poor health is extremely sad.  But then a again the owner is short and bald which explains everything. You have to try to get attention somewhere. It is no wonder some of the other branches are closing their doors."}
{"text":"The burgers were quite bland and forgettable and the menu didn't have a lot to offer. But the golden item on their menu is their milkshakes. This is the only reason I would go back. Apparently, their shakes are made with one whole stick of butter! I know this may seem like much but you MUST taste it. After one sip, you'll get this creamy, sweet after-taste of butter... amazing. Also, I thought the theme was super cute especially with the heart rate machines and the scale to tie it all together."}
{"text":"Wasn't a big fan of this place at all. Didn't live up to the hype. It is very much a you don't like it, there's the door. It's a fun environment and everyone is very friendly but the food wasn't that good. Check out the website before you decide to go."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere, the burgers weren't too bad. My wife however wanted to hit our nurse."}
{"text":"Very cool place, this place lives up to its name in every sense of its name.  You want big, bold and grand when it comes to burgers this is the place.  Staff is enjoyably fun, and the decor screams \"MUST EAT BURGER NOW\"!  My advice, take what want, but eat what you take, or else that's a paddling!  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Dined here last night with my fam and had a blast watching the nurses spank folks who didn't finish their food. Food was basic but you are there for the entertainment!! Fun place!"}
{"text":"Tried to eat there last night with a party of 7. The goofy guy at the door was not interested in trying to seat us and was quite rude. We left and went to flippin burgers down the street. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless they can start treating customers with a little respect."}
{"text":"Seriously good time! We loved this place. Our group of 12 enjoyed the delicious burgers, Jell-O shots & watching the good sport in our group take his spanking for not finishing his whole burger. We had a blast! The hospital gowns that everyone wears adds to the fun, as does the waitresses in nursing costume. Menu is simple. Food is good! We'd go back next time!"}

{"text":"Alot of hype to be honest; maybe our expectations were just too high from all the food channel shows over the years featuring the original location in Phoenix?  TBH the \"nurses\" were not hot, sorry.  The \"fry bar\" does not happen in the vegas location; when asked we are fed excuses about health codes, lol in the city of buffet's you can't have a fry bar, lol suuuuurrrrreeee.  I understand we are in vegas and everything in the tourist areas is expensive, I get it really.  BUT when i'm paying close to 20 bucks for a cheeseburger with 6 strips of bacon, I expect 6 strips, not 2 strips broken into 3 pieces each, cmon.  Same thing regarding sodas n water, really?  I can buy a bottle of water on the bridges n bring it with me next time I guess lol.  Overall service/food quality were par at best, and they were slow.  Burgers were hammered and Im pretty sure our waitress was too.  She spent most of her time wiping down the same table, over and over, or just kinda lookin off into space.  Fries were not good, so no loss on the fry bar.  Checked it off our list but we don't plan to go back when we can goto In n Out, Carls Jr or the awesome burger king inside Rio instead."}
{"text":"Very good burger, shake is good, fries suck, seems like lard and fries don't mix....finish it all or you'll get a spanking jajaja..."}
{"text":"If you have not been to this place you need to. What an experience. Great waitresses, good food and what fun. When they say Heart Attack Grill, they mean it. All the way from the single burger on up. The burgers are good,  the chili is good in the fries are fries. The best part is how they all joke around. When you arrive they put a hospital gown on you and then seat you. This is where the fun begins. Careful when you order a jello shot as it comes in a large syringe that they administer to you (Of course no needle). I ordered the single and left over full. Highly recommended. The picture is of a double that a buddie had"}
{"text":"Very fun experience I must say they kept the theme through and through... all they sell is basically burgers and hot dogs so please be a beef fan.. all the alcohol drinks come in the coolest props.. and you get to keep them! Definitely a fun spot to take the family! And experience the fun. (The minus 1 star for the food , the burgers were just ok but not horrible)"}
{"text":"All I'm gonna say is you have to come here to experience all the fun for yourself and the creative ways they present their food and drinks! Waiters are hilarious!"}
{"text":"Food is OK but it's about the experience! Fun spot to go to with a group of friends. Got a double bypass and shared chili cheese fries. We had a lot of fun, but prob won't go back. It's more of a one time thing."}
{"text":"Kitsch at it's finest!  However I cannot stay away and always seem to need to swing by and people-watch and eat bad-for-you-food.  Fries are good (I always order extra-crispy) and burgers are a delicious, somewhat sloppy, mess.  Um... can I have an extra pat of butter on my shake please?  ha!"}
{"text":"So, I wasn't expecting much food-wise I mean.  Just a good time with great friends which is always a treat regardless of what we are eating.  At best, I was expecting a fast food burger chain type burger...at worst a barely palatable \"looks kinda like meat, doesn't really taste like it\" burger. Boy, was I way the heck wrong!  It was a mighty fine burger. E and I came to the decision that in our burger eating lives thus far, we've had a majority of mediocre burgers,  a few downright not so good burgers, and even less good to great burgers. This was suprprisingly good. Moist, meaty, tasty, and all on a really great bun from a local bakery. I thought it was a potato bun but our nurse (server) didn't know for sure. Their chili chese fries were a great compliment to the burger, shoestring fries with what seemed like a 'no bean hot dog kinda chili' chili. I'm not sure what brand was used but that too was yummy; one of the better ones.  The floor entertainment was hilarious and I'm sure painful. Although, do you really feel any pain if you are swimming in an alcoholic fog? The tiny nurses literally wound up to swat a fellow three times for not finishing his meal. One even swatted the guy on the same cheek  each time - ouch!  All in all a grand time...good burger...great friends. Next time someone suggests venturing out this way, I will not be a naysayer."}
{"text":"This place is fun and I get the theme is really fatty food, but I couldn't eat anything on the menu. I don't eat meat and they wouldn't make me a grilled cheese even if I paid the same price as a burger. I ended up getting the onion rings fried in lard, only cause I was starving!   Fun place though and I would recommend for meat eaters cause the atmosphere is cool."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. Why is this restaurant still open??? They are basically promoting obesity by offering free meals to anyone over 350lbs!!! How can serving a burger called \"triple bypass surgery\" be appetizing??? With all the obesity in america the last thing we need are people eating burgers over 9k calories!!!! This is a disgrace and I am shocked people even think about eating at this morbid place."}
{"text":"Do not eat here. I walked in with my certified service dog and not only was I refused service I was also cussed at and called derogatory names by the owner himself. I have never been so offended. He did not follow ADA regulations. Someone has to do something about this business and their poor choices and lack of respect for disabled people."}
{"text":"Okej, här kommer en svensk recension av ett ställe som jag hade hypat för mig själv (och försökt hypa sällskapet) ett bra tag innan senaste USA-resan.  Heart Attack Grill serverar precis vad du tror: burgare i 10000 kcal-klassen varvat med milkshakes toppade med smörklickar, pommes friterade i rent ister och shots i \"dildosprutor\" som sprutas i munnen av servitrisen. Ägaren och kocken, \"Dr.\" Jon Basso följer sin vision och hymlar inte med att dessa burgare är dåliga för hälsan... ett antal talespersoner för restaurangen har redan avlidit (givetvis inget direkt samband med Heart Attack Grill). Jag skulle kunna skriva kring detta halva natten men dags att recensera besöket!  Tillsammans med två vänner besökte vi restaurangen den 26/6 vid tretiden på eftermiddagen. Vid entrén tilldelas alla patienter (vi) patientkläder av sjuksköterskorna (servitriserna) vilka ska bäras under hela besöket. På menyn finns hamburgare, korv, pommes, milkshakes, läsk, alkohol (shots, öl) samt cigg utan filter...viktigt, utan filter.  Burgarna kan staplas i allt från ett till åtta lager, har för mig att fler lager gick att köpa till om du nu skulle vara så hungrig. Enlagersburgare är tillåtna att dela för sällskap som endast vill smaka, två och högre skapelser är INTE tillåtna att dela. Lyckas du sänka fyra lager eller fler skjutsas du till entrén i rullstol efter besöket. Misslyckas du äta din beställda burgare väntar smisk av sjuksköterskan, en särskild smiskställning finns uppställd i mitten av restaurangen. Vägar du över 350 pounds (~159kg) äter du gratis :)  Samtliga i ställskapet beställde in en Single Bypass Burger med en vanlig Fries och en Chili Cheese Flatliner Fries att dela på. Till detta tog vi cola. Bröden var luftiga och goda även om de kändes överdimensionerade för ett lager kött, ost och bacon. Det märks att de är tänkta hålla betydligt högre kreationer på plats. Köttet var saftigt, baconet salt och gott, osten var svårbedömd. Amerikaner är ostälskare men oftast gäller kvantitet före kvalitet. Pommes blev en blöt röra under chili/ost-såsen. Givetvis blev vi proppmätta, och detta på en singelburgare! Med facit i hand skulle vi skippat pommes och satsat på sänka en två- eller trelagersburgare.  Gå hit om... ...du vill ha en upplevelse utöver det normala. ...du verkligen är ute efter \"upplevelsen\" i första hand, och inte maten. ...du vill sätta tänderna i en hamburgare á 10000 kalorier. ...du har kört ett grymt träningspass innan vill säkra kalorierna. ...du av någon anledning vill pissa på George Bush och/eller Barrack Obama på herrarnas toalett.  Gå inte hit om... ...du förväntar dig ett \"seriöst\" restaurangbesök. ...du ska snacka jämställdhet med ditt sällskap. ...du inte är beredd på att få smisk i fall att du skulle lämna mat. ...du har sjukhusskräck. En i sällskapet blev väldigt dålig och fick lämna restaurangen!"}
{"text":"This is a cash only location. You are greeted at the door & guided into a side room where they put a nurse gown on you. From the changing room, they walk you to your seat. The menu is very basic. I ordered a single burger with fries & a drink. I'm pretty thin & was able to finish the entire meal. (No spankings for me!) The service & entertainment is great! My guests & I had a fun time!"}
{"text":"This place is great, but it's worth noting that the service is not as fun and inviting as advertised. Also worth noting that while they claim to close at 11pm, if you show up at 10:45 the chairs will already be stacked and lights will be off. Show up early if you want to get in!"}
{"text":"With all the hype about this place I expected the WOW factor but unfortunately they missed on that. We left the strip and looked up their operation hours before making the trip and it stated closes at midnight. When we arrived a few minutes before 10pm we were barely greeted with a \"we're closing in 5 minutes, did you want to eat here tonight?\" She then proceeded to ask a manager if she could still seat us. I told her that their website said midnight and if they closed at 10pm we had still made it before that. They  sat us and you could tell that they were very unhappy we had come in. Then a server shouts out loud \"did you really just do that to me?\" to the host. Working in the restaurant industry for more than 10 plus years I clearly know that was restaurant talk for \"why did you seat me right before we close?\" If I wasn't with my in laws I would have just said let's go. The other problem was that the manager didn't really seem to care. Food was good, hopefully it wasn't messed with? There must have been at least 50 people looking to dine inside but the doors were closed, from a business aspect if things, they seem to be missing a lot of revenue by misinforming their guests. Won't recommend it nor be back! Too bad"}
{"text":"I wouldn't give this place a 1 but there is no 0. We went there for the first time last night as it was featured on travel channel and wanted to check it out. The service was slow, waitress didn't check on us while we were there until it was time for the check. You have to pay $2.00 for water and the food was terrible. i was surprised there were lots of people there. It was a waste of money and time. Would not recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"This place is worth a stop for the tourist attraction part at minimum! My boyfriend somehow heard about or found this place on something while we were on vacation in Vegas. We stopped in for lunch after going into several casinos in the area. First off, you can weigh yourself outside. Then you go in and they make you put a hospital gown over your clothes. Then they seat you and explain the rules.  If you weigh more than 350 pounds and will get on the scale that is inside the restaurant so everyone can see your burger is free.  You must eat everything you order or you get spanked. By a waitress in a nurse's uniform with a paddle. Seriously.   The menu is very limited which is probably good since if you order too much... off to get spanked. I ordered a beer (giant can). My boyfriend ordered a daiquiri (the bring it as a virgin daiquiri with the rum in a large pill bottle on the side so you can add it yourself). Drinks were good. The burgers are LARGE. I ordered just a single cheeseburger. My boyfriend got a single burger with everything and a side or fries. The burgers were very good!!!   It took a bit but we finished all our food. Another group didn't. A guy got his three spankings (and they went to town on him but he said he wanted it hard so that's what he got). The woman got three very fast and what sounded to be light spanks. So don't freak that they are going to beat your ass literally if you don't finish your food.  The hostess and our waitress were both super nice. The restaurant is decorated to match the theme and there are evidently some interesting murals and things at the urinals in the men's room that my boyfriend took pics of.   Have fun! Remember this is Vegas!"}
{"text":"I came here with little expectations and walked away a huge fan.  If you're over 350 pounds and get on the scale to prove it, them you can get all you can eat single cheeseburgers.  My friend and I only came in for a beverage and got more than we bargained for.  He got a cheesecake milkshake and I got a red velvet milkshake.  They actually used an entire cupcake in mine and only half of it was blended.  The name says it all as they also put a slice of butter in the milkshakes.  The Jell-O shot is in a huge syringe but it's more like four shots and it's super strong.  There is also a sign if you don't finish your food, you can get spanked in the middle of the restaurant by the naughty \"nurse.\"  The waitresses looked as though they were truly enjoying their jobs and that was a delight to see.  I will definitely come back!!!!"}
{"text":"The chocolate shake was so yummy :) This place is more about the experience but the food was pretty good too. Everyone needs to experience this place at least once."}
{"text":"Novelty - 8/10 - Go once to tell people you've been there.  And duh your going to see sexy nurses and a unique restaurant concept that is telling you to eat so unhealthy it will kill you.  Its expensive for the food you receive but worth the novelty of it and the few pictures you leave with.   Food - 3/10 - Take my word and other yelp comments the burger is nothing special.  The meat is very bland and has no memorable seasoning or sauce (yawn).  For a \"burger\" joint when calories are no concern you think it was the most amazing flavor ever.  It's not.  Burger Guru's go elsewhere.  The fries were a huge disappointment as well.  I went with 6 other people.  We all blamed the soggy fries on being the \"bottom\" of the pan.  We got more unlimited fries when a fresh batch came out and no one loved them at all.  Its funny cause there is a video playing on flat screens and when we saw the crispy looking fries on screen we were like 'we want those!'.  The milkshakes were also disappointing because people expected more flavor like thick ice cream.  It was a very generic base that they just pump flavored syrup into, no blenders.  Also, people that dined the same day as us found a hair ball in the double burger.  It was pretty gross when he held it up and the nurses came running to replace!  I cant wait for his review!  Who will go again?  0 out of 6 of us.  Who is talking about this place to their friends and family? 6 out of 6 of us.  Who felt a little sick to their stomachs? 4 out of 6 of us.  Overall go once have fun.  But if you want a great tasting burger and some calories that may lead to an eventual heart attack find a gourmet burger spot with some crispy bacon, blue cheese crumbles, special sauce, and maybe even a fried egg on top.  A good burger is good til the last bite, this was not."}
{"text":"This is for sure a place you go to for the schtick. You'd think since there are only a couple items on the menu, they would taste decent. The burgers here taste like they've been boiled in water. Don't go here for the food, only go here for the humorous environment."}
{"text":"Fun environment, funny theme, price is not bad- if anything it's cheap for vegas.  Service is good. It really is a great experience.   Cash only. ATM inside.   Food- fries are good, chili is the BEST! Seriously delicious chili that comes on the burger. BUT. The beef patty was not good at all. Better quality at McDonald's. I removed the beef patty and just had a chili and  cheese Hamburger."}
{"text":"This restaurant was really fun! As we walked in, one of the nurses explained the rules to me and my friends. Leftover food=optional spanky. LOL Then we got our gowns on and ordered.   The inside of the restaurant was funny; I really liked the men's bathroom. I think what ruined it for me were the calories. As the doctor was handing us our burgers, he would say, \"get ready to enjoy 3000 calories.\" Each single bypass burger with bacon was 3000 calories! Hahah whoa! Everything is cooked in lard. The only healthy thing on their menu is water! Overall, great experience!"}
{"text":"They have a scale outside to step on and if you weigh in if you get free food. Upon entering your greeted by two very sexy nurses and you place a hospital gown on. We didn't actually eat there because we had just eaten but we had to perk inside because I heard about the restaurant They have warning signs everywhere LOL hazardous to your health ha ha ha ha if you're on vacation I advise stopping in!"}
{"text":"First time here friendly environment beautiful nurses service was excellent portions out of this world and smell is no words can describe it a must see anytime you in vegas"}
{"text":"This is a fun place to go, the atmosphere is great. They offer large burgers and if you don't finish it all you get spanked! There's also a huge scale outside so you can weigh yourself before and after you consume one of their \"heart attack inducing burgers\". They're not known for their healthy options..they have NONE! Which is fitting with its name. The experience was fun! However their food left me disappointed. I felt like I could go to IHOP for the same tasting burger. I ordered the 1/2 lb burger (their smallest size) and some fries. The food tasted like they had been sitting out for a while...and I would have liked to see a couple more options for their hamburgers. Maybe some grilled mushrooms or some different sauces! They do allow you to add bacon by 5 slices! If their food was up too par this would have been a five star experience!"}
{"text":"The single by pass burger was delicious and the right size. Along with the 1/2 pound hot dog. It was so heavy that you can't eat it with your hands, you have to cut the hot dog up into portions to eat it.   Note: They don't sell diet coke here..."}
{"text":"First off let's get this out of the way. They don't take credit cards, nope not that one, or that one. No matter how many you pull out, it's just not happening. Because the are a cash only establishment! We didn't know and came in, but luckily found an ATM around the corner. So please don't come unless you have cash with you. Avoid that ATM fee. The menu is pretty basic, a nurse will bring you it. You choose a burger depending on the topping and patties you want. As well as any extras such as drinks and fries. And the Doctors cook it to perfection. Eat, keep your gown on until a nurse takes it off, and finish your food. There are two reasons for this...The first, there's no take out here. You either eat it or leave it. If you can't finish it, reason two: You'll be punished! A few slaps on the butt by a gorgeous nurse sounds nice. Until you end up like me, I wasn't even able to finish a regular by-pass burger. So I was given the paddle and trust me they don't hold back on those who can't finish their food! But at least they give you a nice hug afterwards~ makes you forget the sting on your behind. If you just want a spanking, I'm sure you'll find the nurses more then eager to satisfy that  curiosity."}
{"text":"Good Experience but worst food. Burger was dry and hard to eat. Lots of fat no flavor. AVOID at all costs"}
{"text":"OK so putting on the hospital gown and sitting around eating was fun but the only thing that was good here was the butter fat shakes so rich and cream I loved them. That said I wouldn't really recommend the place the burgers are dry as dirt and don't taste much better and they charge a fortune the fries were limp and greasy there is nothing about the place that stands out really other than that it's a fun gimmick. The waitress though busy was friendly as well as the hostess who seats you and gives you your gowns I think the quadruple bypass burger is like 9000 calories so having the gown will save time when you have your heart attack LOL"}
{"text":"We thought this would be a funny experience...it was mediocre. Burgers were alright and they gave you a good portion of fries. I ordered a lemonade - it was gross. Tasted like sugar not lemonade. They use cane sugar, but I've gotten several came sugar lemonades before. I didn't finish my food so I got a spanking. Thought it would be funny but just hurt. Restaurant was deserted. Also a strange set up... everything about it screamed fast casual. Food came in baskets and they had trash cans next to the table. Drinks were in glass bottles which I like but that means no refills. I would recommend any of the other numerous burger places in Vegas before going back here."}
{"text":"For those who have never been here, this place is basically a McDonalds with less service (since you garnish your own burger), tiny menu and much more novelty.  Upon entering you are told to sit anywhere.  Most of the seating is bar style around the middle of the room.  The \"bar\"/counter is in the shape of a hospital cross with conveniently placed ass-level mirrors all along the inside for the male patron's viewing pleasure.  You are given a hospital gown and a patient chart to fill in your order along with a hospital bracelet that says \"I Ate at Heart Attack Grill\". Their menu consists of the single (2000 calories), double, triple, or quadruple bypass burgers (8000 calories), flatliner fries, coke (with cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup in the old school cute glass bottle), bottled water beer.  They even offer no filter cigarettes. The prices for the burgers range from $7.29 -$12.95.  I had a single bypass burger and flatliner fries.  The burger was okay and fries were thin and crispy the way I like them. The fries arrived first then when the burger arrives the nurse points you toward the toppings bar where you can add tomatoes, pickles, onion, jalapeños, ketchup and mustard to your burger.  The entire staff is female including the cooks who are also in nurse uniforms.  As expected, most of the customers were male.  The waitresses are very friendly and ours let us take a picture with her at the end of our meal.  Not a bad place for tourists to check out but if I ever returned to Arizona on a second trip I would skip this place."}
{"text":"A very fun experience.  I had friends in from Brazil and they saw Heart Attack Grill on youtube and I said we will go.   Waitresses were nice, we finished our food but still wanted spankings and they were more than happy to give LOL.  Food was good, actually my Brazil friends liked the burger more than In-N-Out (not me) but was all good fun !   Try it out if in LV !  A fun time."}
{"text":"I was partying downtown with friends celebrating birthday. After few hours of drinking had the munchies and deciding where to go someone like Hear Attack Grill. I was the only one that never been there so for me kind of excited.   Everything about it screams TOURIST thing too do. But hey nothing wrong with playing Vegas tourist since only partying downtown. By the end I was getting into the whole touristy thing with you have too were hospital gowns or not going too let you in (I have mixed emotions on it; we made most of it little food fight sprayed each other with ketchup and mustard all over it), the waitresses all dressed up in nurses outfit, doctor dressed up, wheel chairs, paddle, and some people think corny but adds too the Heart Attack experience.  I had the single burger without the bacon. I know going soft but thinking more drinking not overload on food night was early. It was pretty tasty burger. It was cooked perfect. The bun nice and toasted. Talk about size god the single could be doube-double at In-N-Out. Yay it oversized burger but unlike most oversized burgers this burgers had great flavor. It not all about the amount of meat shove down (it is option if you choose) but fact the patties have nice flavor. Different. The fries were good too. No way going too fit in shake. I still In-N-Out guy but if ever in downtown need burger fix sure heading down for some Heart Attack Grill style!"}
{"text":"Its a shame. Funny/Cool Novelty concept. Cool atmosphere.Very original. But....The food was horrible. When I am willing to push the concern of my health aside and eat greasy, unhealthy, fatty food, its because it is BOMB.com good. My Burger...NASTY....Fries....NASTY...shake was good (but you can really only take a few bites until you notice the lard on the spoon). Its a shame. If they could pull out some good burgers, and maybe add some kind additional unhealthy dish (ribs, ribs and BBQ), it would be a cool place to check out. In the meantime, if you have the urge to flush your health down the toilet, I recommend swinging by a McDonnell's drive through. The take credit card, and their burgers and frys will beat this place any day."}
{"text":"All this place serves is burgers or hotdogs. They make you wear a weird hospital gown which they are very serious about. After eating my very over priced burger, and waiting in the check I took off the silly gown. I was approached by a waitress and told that I must put the gown back on until I leave the restaurant.."}
{"text":"The only thing you need to know about this place is to stay far away from it. Went there while on vacation at the recommendation of a friend. The theme was as the name describes. However, I was expecting a greasy \"heart-attack\" burger. Instead, it was dry and just horrible. The place smelled like a hospital which I guess is the theme but it was hard to stomach the whole experience."}
{"text":"All show no substance. As in the whole setup is amazingly entertaining & the hostess go out of their way to play the part. But thats it. The food is far from being satisfactory. That said I would recommend at least one time visit just to soak in the fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Really good food and you get a lot for the price.  Several guys and a girl got spanked while I was there and it was put online which we went to the website to watch.  Pretty entertaining and the prices are decent as well."}
{"text":"This is defiantly a place to go just to say you have been here. The food is ok nothing that I would go back because I craved it, but than again that's probably good considering how big their burgers are. And if you don't finish your burger you get spanked by your nurse server. Well if you like to be spanked don't finish. We didn't know about that added attraction, I can say I'm glad I didn't order a burger just fries because I know I can't eat a lot. I did like the wine IV bag that is a really cute idea."}
{"text":"very delicious place. I love the coronary hot dog. I highly recommend this place to eat. trust me you must try it. (:"}
{"text":"I have to say I was not impressed with this place at all.  It has a good gimmick.  When entering there is a huge sign on the door stating cash only and you are reminded of this by the nurse who is positioned behind  a glass wall. She kindly reminds you that it is cash only and they have an ATM if you need it.  All \"patients\" must wear a hospital gown.  We were sat near the paddle station but sadly positioned so we really couldn't see what was really happening except the beatings. :) (You are beaten if you don't finish your food.  in reality, you have to buy one of their souvenir paddles.).   It took a bit for our waitress to come over to us to place our orders.  There really isn't much variety on the menu, it is a burger or a chili hot dog.  I got a single burger and my husband order the chili dog with fries.  The burger was bland even with chili on it and the fries were just soggy not crisp at all.  My husband's chili dog didn't have enough chili on it to cover the whole thing. Oh, and you can't just order a glass of water, you have to pay for bottled water and the Coca Cola bottles are the smaller kind.  Paying $3 a pop was not pleasant.   We were entertained while we ate as several tourists were being \"spanked\" but all in all the place is not worth a repeat.  Food was eh, service was eh, and the prices were eh."}
{"text":"This place is quite shocking. I'm giving it one extra star for the experience.  I would say it is a place meant for people who have a fetish for gluttony. You need to be really open minded coming here.  Stepped on the large scale outside and I first weighed in at 105 lbs.  walking in I could not figure out how to enter.  I attempted to walk in through the turnstyle and failed.  Finally a nurse came and dressed me in a hospital gown.  I totally felt uncomfortable because all I could think about was being in a hospital where there are germs and sickness.  (It was a Psychological discomfort). And all of a sudden we saw people getting spanked by a midget who rides around in a mini ambulance to deliver food. It looked like it was so hard and painful!!  So as we were looking at the menu we read all these rules.  I was definitely not going to submit myself to such nonsense. I have absolutely no ass to save my life!  And it was a turn off that we would get punished for not finishing our food.  Skinny bitch was def in the wrong place.  We shared a burger and I ordered a butter fat shake.  I LOVE butter and all unhealthy delicious food, this got me excited and it tasted so yumm. But I could barely drink much it was extremely rich. The way they personalize and serve shots in a prescription bottle is really cool.  What grossed me out is that I bit into a part in my burger that was cold and hard that I could not chew. It was a large enough chunk. It was definitely the insides of a cow that I probably would not want to eat.  I made it out without punishment.  I wanted to try the wine that they serve in an IV but I was much too full. Upon leaving I weighed in at 107lbs. Can't be?  2 lbs?!"}
{"text":"This is such a fun place to go and eat! The staff is amazing! I will definitely be back because my nurse Dominique made the whole experience fun And memorable!"}
{"text":"One of the most unique restaurants I have been to due to the atmosphere. The only items on the menu are burgers and hotdogs. The food is decent but the entertainment is top notch. This is a restaurant for your friends not family."}
{"text":"I want to say the staff deserves 5  stars. They are truly wonderful, upbeat, friendly & courteous. I especially loved Lola-she is very personable and charismatic.   The decor is unique, comical, & interactive. It's a very fun themed eatery. The menu doesn't have many options and the fact that the onion rings & fries are deep fried with lard almost made me fall off my chair in shock.  We had the bypass burger and it was okay. The 7up and coke remind me of the old school soda. There is a sign outside that says if you are over 350 lbs, you will eat for free. I kid you not, a young teenager got on that scale and he weighed 498 lbs-that's just, .... WOW. You can't come to Fremont and not try this place out. It's a lot of fun but don't go crazy and order a huge portion, and stay away from all the really bad stuff. You're mostly there for the experience not so much the food."}
{"text":"Have you ever wished you were morbidly obese? You would if you went here. If you are over 350 pounds (no lying, they weigh you in the middle of the restaurant) then you eat for free.   You walk in and are greeted by a hot girl dressed as a nurse. Every guy's dream right? And then said nurse helps you into a hospital gown, which you are required to wear throughout your meal.  They have burgers, fries, shakes, and liquor. That is all. If you are expecting more, you will be disappointed. Everything is calorie-filled and tasty, and you won't leave hungry. The shakes have a pad of butter on top and are around 2000 calories.  They only take cash but have an ATM in the restaurant with a small 75 cent service fee.  If you don't get a heart attack from eating their food, you will definitely get one from looking at the waitresses.  This is definitely a fun place to go if you are in town, but I definitely wouldn't come here on a regular basis, unless I wanted to gain a bazillion pounds."}
{"text":"The food was really good and well worth the grub. It really lives up to it's name as well so better be prepared to go with an empty stomach"}
{"text":"It was ok and thats about it. This was not the place I would have chosen to eat but it wasn't my turn to pick.  First off 2/3's of the people that go to vegas are fat f$%# so this is right up their ally. I don't really see why people try and say how bad this place is compared to all of the all you can eat buffets with their 500 feet of food troughs in them so whats the difference with this place? They are just cashing in on fat america like all the other food places. Anyway the menu is a burger, hotdog, fries or chili fries, limited drink options plus milkshakes with a tab of butter on top why? Why the hell not after you ate the 7 patty burger with the pound of bacon, chili, lettuce, tomato and cheese on it. I got the single, the girls split a single and the other guy in the group got a double. We finished everything so we didn't get paddled, but some people weren't so lucky.   The food? It wasn't bad. It was a pretty big patty, the fries were good, coke in a glass bottle. Our service was a little slow but it was pretty busy on a friday night.   Oh yeah if your 350+ you eat for free, there is a scale in the place with a big led screen above for all to see."}
{"text":"BF and I visited here for lunch in November ironically after my ER visit that morning. Walked in and received the hospital gown, but no bracelet since mine was still an original from St. Rose. :D   The decor of the place is really unique. Lots of movie posters with the quotes changed to reflect the overall restaurant theme. Waitresses are dressed as sexy nurses and take your order from an iPhone.  Just a note, this place is 100% fat, full flavor. It's not Burger King where you can have it your way. I don't eat beef, but thought I would be able to just order without the beef on it. Nope. So, we compromised and BF and I both ordered single bypass burgers and I took the beef patty off mine and gave to him.  Single bypass comes with 5 slices of bacon. Fries are cooked in lard, and while he loved them, I prefer my fries crispy. Wanted water, but they don't have it, understandable with the theme. No diet soda, no light beer, no skinny cocktails, all full fat! lol   Didn't try their milkshakes because they seemed much too filling.  Honestly, a lot of people think this place is just horrible for your health calorie/fat wise, but you're probably gonna get the same, if not more from ordering a creamy, cheesy, pasta dish from another restaurant, so why not go for the experience?  Won't go back, not because of the service, but just because we only went for the initial experience, or unless we go with out of town guests next time."}
{"text":"its a burger joint. i had high expectations on being the most greasiest and tastiest burger. but... it was a burger. ive had greasier and tastier ones.   their chocolate milkshake is so thick. im talkin about the actual milkshake, not nurse stephanie. ooh nurse stephanie you are such a bad girl! she dished out just as much dirty, perverted jokes, and innuendos as i could muster. DONT LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT! shes the one who started it!   thick... chocolate... milkshake..."}
{"text":"A novelty.  2  orders of soggy all you can eat fries, 2 single cheese burgers, 1 -1.82 water, and 1 coke. $24.00 . CASH ONLY! Lobbys has a much better burger.  I wish we would have went out for anything else!"}
{"text":"It is a novelty restaurant.  So the nurses look good but the food is not the best. If you are there for the novelty of getting a free burger or to get spanked by the nurses it is cool. If you are looking for a great meal you may choose other options."}
{"text":"The Heart Attack Grill is fun.  If you love kooky stuff like hospital gowns, sexy nurses, and crazy alarms, you'll be right at home here. The food here is EXTREMELY indulgent, but it all tastes great (yes, even the butter chocolate shake).   It's not gourmet, but it makes for a good vacation destination."}
{"text":"SO MUCH FUNNNN!!!  This place is definitely an awesome experience for the fam !! From dressing up in hospital gowns as you walk in to the syringe shots, they have outdone themselves! Also, make sure to eat all your food or they'll be giving you spankings...."}
{"text":"The Heart Attack Grill.  A fantasy of scantily clad nurses and greasy burgers!  Oh this could be soooo great.  It positively makes me cry that it just missed greatness.  Let me explain.  First off, the place requires sexy nurses.  Well...  they had uniforms... but honestly I think you will do better at most of the casino brew pubs.  The girls are cute... but seem more like the crew I would expect at In N Out Burger.  I know....  I know... this has nothing to do with food..  but hey...  I didn't invent the place.  I am just going by the image they project.  And this demanded to be rated.  Ok.. so the food.  Burgers are good, tasty, and slightly overcooked.  The fries....  well..  not worth it.  But I have to say I love the simple menu.  If you are in the mood for a refreshing Iced Tea or a Diet Coke... head someplace else.  It's sugary beverages, liquor, or milkshakes.  OK.  I'm in!  :)  The shakes are the thickest fattest shakes I have ever seen.  There is actually a piece of butter on top.  Ya.. well...  look at the name of the place.  Overall...  a fun menu.  Burgers, shakes, cokes, and a guy getting spanked by teenage waitresses in nurse uniforms.  Overall, not a bad lunch.  It's really not about food quality here.  This place is supposed to be an ultimate male indulgence.  Sexy it up a bit and figure out a way to take credit cards.... and I would add another star.  Make it adults only and we'll talk.  Oh ya... if you are over 350lbs you eat for free.  Umm..."}
{"text":"Heart Attack Grill: Well how can you give a bad review for places that serve GIANT, GIANT, GIANT, Burgers, that promote obesity and to overeat. HAHA   This is definitely a novelty place, I don't think I could eat here to many times, if at all again.   If your over 350lbs you get your meal for free. LOL  So my friend ordered a Triple Burger with everything and I ordered a Double Burger with everything. In addition, we ordered the chili fries and there hot dog which seemed like 2lbs. Everything on it, has chili, cheese, onions and tons of bacon.   This was a mistake, we could have easily split the double burger. My buddy ate about a 3/4 of the triple which was a great accomplishment, each patty seemed like 1/3 of a lbs, if not more. Very tall and big, big burgers.   I ate almost half of my burger, for me it was a little too meaty, but was pretty good overall. The hot dog was really good, we split that. I could have had half of the hot dog and been perfect. But we went there to be pigs and try everything there. I had maybe one fry as I could not eat anymore.   You can't customize your burger, you can only leave ingredients off, I wanted chili on the side, but they said they couldn't do that. The chili looks like it can cause some serious damage, next day in the bathroom, just saying. HaHa  So if you go there, you can easily split a burger with someone, unless you are a super eater, then I recommend getting a burger just for yourself.   But for the novelty of it, you should try one burger on your own.. They make you wear hospital gowns when your eating in there, this is kind of funny and strange at the same time, but it's going along with the theme of everything.   They were spanking people in there that didn't eat all their food, it was quite humorous as they really spank them hard, a paddle broke when I was in there. LOL  I will definitely go back there with someone who has never been there, for the experience."}
{"text":"I cannnot believe the quality of food at this restaurant.  How it survives in Las Vegas, the food capital of the world, is beyond me.  The hamburger I ordered was just a single, and thank God, I didn't order anything bigger.  The single patty had 4 pieces of grizzle in it.  It was dried out, like it was yesterday's leftover!  They don't serve anything but alcoholic drinks and Coke and bottled water.  My husband ordered fries with his burger and they were floating in grease.  This place is no joke, if you eat the fries, you can have a coronary!  I've eaten in many restaurants in Vegas, and this has to be the worst, and it is a tourist trap.  Stay away!"}
{"text":"I am in the area for a baseball camp and my buddy suggested that we visit the Heart Attack Grill for their famous quadrupal bypass burger.  I wasn't in mood to eat it all so I got the double bypass burger.  Didn't finish it.  The texture of the burgers and bun and cheese got to me so I stopped eating.  My friend finished the quadrupal and took a picture with the nurse and doctor while sitting in the wheelchair.   The more I think about this restaurant, the more I think that this is Arizona's version of Hooters (girls in skimpy clothing serving food that is just ok).  The fries there were a funny color...not golden brown.  We wanted to watch the game today but they have no tv.  Instead you get to watch a bunch of videos about the Heart Attack Grill as well as some old videos such as \"Fat\" by Weird Al, \"In the Navy\" by the Village People, and \"I Got You Babe\" by Sonny and Cher.   The best thing I can say is that they serve Cokes in big glass bottles.   Lots of creativity...but I think it is overkill.  At some point, you have to be concerned with the quality of food being served.  Oh yea, I forgot to mention that the cook is dressed in a scrubs, the waitresses are either in nurse outfits or scrubs, the owner was in a doctor's labcoat...and the customers...well, we get to wear gowns."}
{"text":"Wasn't a big fan... burgers and hot dogs were super greasy and over priced. Basic french fries and blonde beer in a can. Yes the atmosphere of it all is what makes it good. Super funny since you must wear a hospital gown & the nurses(waitresses) are going around either giving shots ;) or spanking someone since they didn't finish their meal. Overall okay... guess a must place to eat when in old Vegas!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth a visit. The food is just okay, but it's a really fun place. Loved it! Our server was alot of fun too. We managed to eat all of our food so nobody got spanked! I would recommend this place to any first time visitor."}
{"text":"If you're coming here, you know this stuff is absolutely horrible for you. BUT THAT'S THE POINT!  The lard fries were amazing. The burger was absolutely mouthwatering delicious. The Mexican sugar cola was tasty.  Yeah, maybe I put on a half pound or so in the process, its fattening as hell and dunked in grease and butter, but it's damn tasty. Couple that with hot girls running around in nurse outfits serving you up and you've got yourself a winner. The owner was awesome too, real laid back and chill guy. The fact you have to throw on a hospital gown and the overall atmosphere of the place is pretty amusing and cool.   This place is no gimmick, if you want a bomb burger and fries and don't mind tossing over a G of calories in your system, slide through!"}
{"text":"They have a neat novelty theme here. All guests were hospital gowns. The burger menu is quite clear and simple. My husband and I had the single burger and onion rings. Good thing we decided to split it. The servings are great. If you order wine.....it is served in a IV bag. Very fun place."}
{"text":"Loved the burgers here! Don't order fries with your burger unless you know you can finish it all! Its an awesome atmosphere! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is crazy! Words cannot describe it - you will have to go see this for yourself!   The food was good, of course it was because its nowhere near healthy! A place worth checking out one time."}
{"text":"This place = Failtown, USA.  My friends and I went in a while back to check out what all the hype was about this place.  Sure, it seemed like it was a Hooters knockoff (replace wings with burgers), but we had some hope that this establishment would be legit. WRONG.  The waitress informs one of my buddy's that if he finishes some sort of monster glutton burger then the meal was on the house.  Well sometime later, after putting that entire burger away, we get the check and notice the burger was still on the check.  We bring it up with the waitress who beats around the bush.  We then ask for the manager, who was VERY non-compliant.  After the discussion turns into an argument (wow real professional on your part Heart Attack Grill), he threatens to \"call the cops if we don't leave and we better or else he's going to jump over the counter and punch us in the face.\"  SO MUCH FAIL  Regardless of whether the food was good or not (nothing spectacular), I am NEVER going back there again nor would I recommend anyone else to do so.  There's a Red Robin a mile west on Warner that has a full bar and burgers just as gluttonous with unlimited steak fries to boot.  If I could give this place 0 stars (along with AIDS, Herpes, Cancer, and a slow fiery death), I would.  DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE"}
{"text":"The people here are great ! The food is OK but extreme big! It's more an attraction then a restaurant. We laughed and had a lot of fun here ! We will come back!"}
{"text":"The service was a little slow to start off, but when it came to the food it was definately interesting. I got the Triple Bypass burger which is 1 1/2 lbs of beef plus 11 slices of bacon, tomatoes, onions and cheese for $14. I also got the butterfat chocolate shake which came with a slice of butter as garnishment. Perhaps I will go here again in a few months after my body recuperates from this time."}
{"text":"Food was not great at all.  Our waitress was great however all the other waitresses look like they didnt want to be there and complained.  It just a tourist attraction.  The onion ring was like u are just eating lard.  Wasn't crispy just oily gross.  The burgers was totally dry.  Waste of money"}
{"text":"CASH ONLY. Burger meat is good but the Chili is pretty gross, mushy like cat/dog food texture. Overpriced everything.   Nice one time experience to see someone get a super hard paddle in their butt 3X!!!.by 3 different nurses......which traumatized my almost 4 year old son after seeing that scene."}
{"text":"I'm loving the whole dress up thing. The whole concept is pretty neat. I had fun! It's great to experience the Heart Attack Grill while you're visiting Vegas and happen to be on Fremont street, but I doubt any locals eat there.   Their menu's simple. There's a bypass burger in a few different sizes and fries that's fried in lard. That's pretty much the only options, which is a bummer. I also notice they had mayonnaise sitting out and was wondering if they had refrigerate it over the nights. I didn't bother to touch the mayo(being cautious) and already acknowledging that their food is already very unhealthy. They also have milkshakes that are served with butter on top(yuck!) and they offer a buttermilk milkshake. The thought of that kind of grosses me out. This place is very unhealthy and anyone over 350 pounds get to eat free. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Gross food, scary and the staff are bullies.  The worst food and most horrible people in Las Vegas. I wish I could give it a negative star. I ordered water, hot dog and a chocolate milk shake. The water was cold. But the shake tasted like any cheapo fake shake. The hot dog tasted sour and the chili smelled and tasted vaguely like vomit. The bun was stale and hard. I could not swallow the bite I took. We asked for the check and I told our server that I would pay for the water and the shake (I ate 2 or 3 bites). However I hadn't been able to eat the hot dog so I took it off the bill. She said \"no, you have to pay\". I asked to speak with the manager and this is when I got weird. The manager also demanded I pay. She stood no more than 10 inches from me saying she wasn't going to let me leave. I told her at least 10 times to back up. She yelled across the restaurant for someone to call security. Meanwhile another manager comes to stand very close to me. They were threatening me until I finally put the money down and ran crying from the restaurant. I stopped security and told them what happened. Security told us they held me there illegally and that they wouldn't have made me pay. At that point I thought, ok, I'll get my receipt and write an e-mail. As I entered the restaurant and employee met me at the door, raised her arms and hit me squarely on both shoulders. She said,\"You're not coming in here. I stepped back from the impact and yelled I'm a customer and I want my receipt. I grabbed it and ran back to my hotel. DO NOT EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"It's more an experience than a restaurant.  Menu is awesome, there are some unique stuff, very funny.  Be aware that if you don't finish your meal, you'll get spanked. You can choose to get spanked if you finish it too :-)  There is scale, i was 3 pounds lighter before I had lunch.  CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"This place is heavy on gimmick, but I'll tell you the burgers are phenomenal!  I think it wouldn't kill the theme to have Diet Cokes, but that's a small issue.  I plan on visiting again on my next visit to the valley."}
{"text":"It's a great place to go if you want something different and electrifying!  They put a hospital gown on you!  Wine in IV bags  Jell-O shots in syringes  And of course nurses serving you!  The food is good and just make sure you finish it!"}
{"text":"This is one of those unique famous places that any food nut wants to try once in their life.  I went there on my first visit to Arizona last year, and it pretty much was what I expected based off of tv specials and internet videos and interviews.  You get a decent burger at a decent price, and then you go up to the fry-bar and grab some fries and add some toppings to your burger.    There's something rewarding about going into a place that says it will kill you, and walking out alive afterwards.  The experience comes complete with having to wear a hospital gown, and being waited on by \"nurses\".  The angled mirrors on the inside of the serving area are a nice touch ; )  Now that I moved to Arizona, I'm sure I'll be back each and every time a new friend or family member comes to town to visit me."}
{"text":"Just horrifying to say the least.  I thought this place had a funny and creative concept until the day I actually walked inside; I have never in my life wanted to leave a restaurant more quickly.  Being brusquely demanded to wear a warm hospital gown and sat down in one of the only restaurants rude enough to not provide free tap water to paying customers is the last thing someone wishes to be greeted by during a Las Vegas heat wave. Furthermore you are given the ultimatum between forcing extra food down your throat or being publicly beaten if you don't quite feel up to finishing your meal in front of these people.  I didn't even need to try the food to know this would've been one of the most unpleasant eating experiences possible.  I simply left and believe 100% that I made a very wise decision. Judging from many of the reviews, the overpriced food is foul anyways, sacrificing flavor to add as many calories as possible. I am completely for the idea of frying food in lard, but only if it actually makes the food taste better...."}
{"text":"Will only give three stars for two reasons: the theme/concept and my husband somehow enjoyed his meal. He got a triple bypass with the 15 slices of bacon and I got a single. He loves meat so he was right at home, but mine was completely tasteless. I ate the whole thing only for the fun of the game, but if I was anywhere else I would've had maybe two bites. Our server was BUSY and didn't give very good service but I know that only because of how slammed she was. There were also a few super drunk douche bags there that were probably not helping her mood. I would never take my kids there but some people did bring them in and they do have high chairs there. They played good music too, so at least it was entertaining to watch people get spanked and listen to good tunes. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend, everyone was super nice and friendly and burgers were good but when it comes to the paddled .. all I say beware but I got spanked and now I have a bruise on my butt! I get it's funny but they should do it so damn hard.... it should hurt but not leave you a Feaking bruise !"}
{"text":"Ok, I went here cause I remembered Guy from Triple D. So from the looks of this place......if your a foodie, you gotta come in and try this place out.  When you first walk in they give you a hospital gown. The hostess and waitresses are all dressed like nurses. The inside looks like a Diner from the 80s.  When we get to our table the menu was pretty cool looking. A bunch of hot babes, wrapped in bacon and laying on hotdogs which was out of the norm of course but cool looking. The menu mainly consist of Burgers Hotdogs chili, fries and shakes.  From looking at the pictures of the burgers on the menu they didn't look like they had any quality to them, so at the at moment I knew I wouldn't really like it. But my daughter was excited so I stayed. Ordered a double cheese burger and fries. So did my daughter. If i remember correctly they had a burger with like 6 patties on it, bacon and cheeses preeeety extreme. While waiting for my food, a waitress was making an announcement with a paddle in her handle as she walked a young man to a place to bend over. She said he was a bad boy cause he didn't finish his food So he had to be paddled . And she back cocking her arm back like a New York Sox pitcher and whammed him on his ass.....it looked as if it hurt.......he smiled however  he may have liked it .  I got my food and the quality sucked bad. The meat first the burger taste like the cheapest type of Beef EVER. Even the FRIES sucked....and I LOVE fries. BUT I was forced to eat it cause I didn't want to get paddled .   over all the experience was cool, but the food sucked"}
{"text":"**Anyone who can be offended easily and take it personally, please do not come here. Honestly. Save the hassle for yourself**  Outside and inside, you are fully warned that this is an offensive restaurant. That, is what drew my guest and I inside though. Something different than a typical restaurant. Kind of like an Ed Debevic's.  First, you can weigh yourself on a scale outside to see if you'll qualify for a free meal, or to simply see how much you weigh going into the restaurant! Next, after probably waiting in line for some time to get in, you have a hospital gown put on you. You know, to make sure that you don't spill or get grease on yourself! How courteous! Next, you see some instructional videos about how the restaurant operates and historically, how it was founded. You are \"rudely\" seated and explained the rules again that you MUST finish your food or you will be spanked by a paddle. Male, female, old, young, they will get you. Every fifteen minutes or so, in between their incredibly corny and hilarious music videos, comes a sing/dance-a-long. Which, you guessed it, you MUST participate in (within reason) or you will be spanked. It's to help settle some of the grease and massive amounts of food. You may get to see a person or two publicly weighed in front of the entire restaurant to see if they qualify or when others are forced to do karaoke in front of everyone.  All of it is for an incredible price, hilarious atmosphere, and some pretty good greasy food and milkshakes (or beer if you want). You get to take a picture in a wheelchair at the end and shoved out the door.  Again, if you get offended easily, don't waste your time. On the walls and windows, they give their PO Box number and phone number and email to send complaints to because simply, they don't care and for good reason. :)"}
{"text":"A burger relative to a Carls Jr burger, Fries and a milkshake  $26.00 (without tip)  WTF  this place is a tourist trap.  If the burgers don't kill you the bill will.   Plus not everyone wants to wear a hospital gown to eat.  The girls look like out of work tranny hookers fresh off Karen street."}
{"text":"The food and service are both pretty much 3-star (i.e. not bad, but not spectacular), but this restaurant gets an extra star for novelty (you likely already know about the general theme and most of the quirks of this place, so I'll won't go into excessive detail in discussing those areas).  The hospital gown that you are forced to wear as a diner is actually quite practical, as it proved very effective in keeping me from making a mess on my clothes while eating.  The threatened outcome of a paddling for failing to finish your burger can indeed be realized here: during my meal, I got to see a tall (he looked to be about 6'-ish) grown-ass man get spanked by a \"nurse\" (i.e. waitress) for precisely that infraction. The \"punishment\" was comical for a number of (mostly obvious) reasons, but two in particular: 1) the nurse was approximately 4' tall, and 2) she *really* leaned into that shit - the 3 whacks were conspicuously loud from even the opposite end of the restaurant, and homeboy memorably jumped and rubbed his ass from the surprise of the unrestrained forcefulness of the first spanking.  As mentioned earlier, my burger and fries were not mind-blowing, but they did satisfy my hunger, and were not unreasonably priced for their large size. I was more impressed by the level of effort made by the owner/management in building the palpable atmosphere of cheekiness and political incorrectness in all aspects of the restaurant.  I can't say with certainty that I'd come back here a 2nd time (partly because the food is \"meh\", and partly because I honestly *DON'T* want experience an actual heart attack). But, I *will* say that if you've never been here, you owe it to yourself to make at least one visit (for the novelty, if nothing else). Any restaurant that will itemize your sales tax as \"government theft\" on your receipt deserves at least one visit based on general principle alone."}
{"text":"Intentional tacky, but just pure fun.  Very good burger and fires and the place is a blast.  80's music videos playing on the tvs and sound system   Go with a good attitude -- it's meant to be fun"}
{"text":"Even thinking about this place gives me a stomach ache. Where to begin, The atmosphere was fine, I liked the cheesy music on the outdated televisions, but thats about it . At first their whole hospital themed gimmick was cute then just got hugely annoying. The waitress was completely unattentive and even rude. There is NO WATER, which you will be begging for after a bite of their sodium packed but tasteless food. After a bite of their soggy flavorless food and too thick and rich chocolate shake I was ready to leave. I am a HUGE fan of anything that tacky and greasy food. But all their butter filled ingredients were all gratitious and adds nothing to the flavor of  the food. I have a stomach of steel and this place left me with an upset stomach. AVOID AT ALL COST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here over saint pattys weekend. It was absolutely amazing. We found out about it from a TV series on Netflix and couldn't wait to experience it. Not only were the burgers absolutely delicious but the atmosphere was definitely something to experience. We watched a handful of people get their spankings, one nurse had a softball pitchers swing. It was hilarious. We would definitely go again. I recommend it if your in the Vegas area!"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas, I love a good burger and had read all the hype on this place. The backstory sounded like a lot of fun...the nurses, hospital gowns, etc.  The reality is, it's a dive with overpriced sub-par burgers and fries. In a town where there are hundreds (maybe thousands) of choices, this was the bad one."}
{"text":"If you like flavor, avoid this spot. The lack of flavoring makes you think this restaurant has never heard of Lawry's or garlic salt. Who tf serves milkshakes with butter? This restaurant is all fat no flavor and I don't know if that is a compliment or not. I would take my chances with gas station sushi instead, at least the wasabi and ginger give that flavor."}
{"text":"Go for a good time - not the food!  This is a fun and unique place to go with friends or coworkers but, I wasn't a fan of the food. If you don't eat red meat or drink alcohol, you don't belong here!  Don't get me wrong, I had a blast with a group of people traveling together for work but, I didn't eat anything. Nothing on the menu appealed to me.  This seems more appropriate for a bachelor party. Parents, please don't bring your children here!  If you don't finish your burger, the tiny waitress spanks you with a wooden paddle in the center of the restaurant.  The staff gets friendly with you the second you walk in the door as they fit you for a hospital gown. I must say, I've never laughed so much at a work dinner!  Just the way the wine is served kept me laughing all night!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the experience everyone should go at least once, i mean why not?? But now about the food, the chocolate shake was delicious should try it, the burgers are pretty huge might i add, i got the the triple bypass and only ate 1/3..(ate the rest later ;)...) but the fires were burnt and there margaritas were pretty nasty... so in all i gave it what i did..."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I was hesitant to try this place out. However, I was pleasantly surprised.  The food was not the tasteless lump of meat everyone said it was, it was a delicious burger that I enjoyed.  The fries were ok; not my favorite, but not horrible.  Very fun atmosphere. My friend and I both ordered the shot specials in the menu, 4oz shots for under $5. We ordered them with coke, and a glass so we could combine them as cocktails. They don't have any ice, so we had warm cocktails by the time we finished. Also when we got the bill, the shots rang up as $9.75! I told the waitress they were supposed to be the 4-something that was advertised in the menu, and she just said \"no, that is wrong...\" That was my only complaint about our service.  I would come back here for sure, bringing people who haven't been before. I probably wouldn't go back just to have their food again."}
{"text":"I felt good going in.  I felt good eating there.  I felt woozy on the way out.  Went with the coworkers to the new HAG.  The environment is cool.  Nurses, lots of big screen TV's, a kind of 60's diner feel.  The TV's play music videos from the 70's and 80's.  Thm menu makes jokes about the price of taxes, which our government squanders (or something like that).  This place definitely has character.  Oh yeah, and the waitress nurses are pretty damn hot.  The food was great.  I loved my single and fries, which was more than enough to fill me up.  The burger was juicy and tasty, and the fat-coated buns were amazing.  One of my coworkers ate an entire quadruple hamburger (1/5 pound patties).  Our waitress wheeled his fatass out in a wheelchair.  None of us were big enough for the \"weight in at 350 lbs or more and eat free\".  Maybe my quadruple-eating coworker will work on this.    The service was friendly, efficient, and easy on the eyes. The prices weren't bad.  They don't serve water at all.  I'm not sure that is legal.  We'll see how long that lasts.  Also, the place is cash only (ATM inside).  Plenty of malt liquor brands are offered, but not a lick of quality craft beer.  I guess the really bad part about HAG is how you might feel afterwards.  My stomach is currently upset.  My head is foggy.  I'm pretty sure this review will be poorly written as I can't really focus right now.  I mean, the buns are coated in lard for gosh sake.  Hello cholesterol and sugar overdose!  Great to experience once, but I won't be making a habit of eating here.  If you don't eat a lot of fast food, you might want to think about eating McDonald's for a week before hand to train yourself up to meeting the Heart Attack Grill challenge.  I didn't, and now I am paying the consequences!"}
{"text":"What a place, just a lot of fun if you Don't mind calories !!! Everything there is big , bad and delicious !! I got the double cheeseburger, it comes with 12 pieces of bacon, wanted a bud light, \"nope\" only bud heavy ! You have to wear a hospital Johnny . if u don't finish your meal u get spanked by the waitress !!! And if your over 350lbs you eat for free !"}
{"text":"Service is good but food isn't very flavorful. Bun for hot dog and burgers very dry and too thick. Focus of this place is all on the the amount of food and not on the taste quality of the food."}
{"text":"The Heart Attack Grill is completely ridiculous and that's why its completely cool. If you don't have a sense of humor or If you're a higher then thou health food nut, then don't go. Seriously go eat your box of triple bean veggie burgers, wash it down with a fresh fruit smoothie and crap your pants all night. But if your like most of us and you like to indulge yourself once in awhile and just enjoy the taste of a big greasy cheesy burger and some fatty fries then get your self over to the Heart Attack Grill on Freemont Street in Vegas. The fun starts here before you even get through the door when you can weigh in on the freight scale right outside the entrance and display your weight to anyone passing. And guess what..if the scale reads 350 pounds or above your meal is on the house! Thankfully I did not make weight and the wife did not either, so after getting dressed up in hospital gowns by the rather well endowed waitstaff ( also dressed as nurses) we were brought to our seats. The menu is simple. Burgers, Fries, Non Diet Sodas,Booze and Shakes ...and unfiltered cigarettes ( seriously). You can get your burger as a single, double triple or quadruple Bypass complete with Cheese, Bacon, Tomato, and Sauteed Onions. The Fries are just one size and are fried in pure lard. The shakes are thick and made of butterfat ( and alcohol if you wish) and are garnished with a hunk of butter. Simone and I both had a single bypass with Fries and It was more then enough food. We both agreed that while not the best burger ever, these were still very well cooked, juicy and cooked through and complete with fresh tasting toppings. The cheese was classic American. the bacon was crispy, the onions sweet and the tomato cut thick. The bun was excellent, soft and yet durable enough to hold up under the Burger drippings.  The Flatliner fries, as they are called, were average and not consistently cooked. They were fresh cut but some were crispy while others were more on the soggy side. Overall the Heart Attack Grill was a lot of fun. The food was good comfort food in all the wrong ways, The service was friendly ( in every way) and the atmosphere was unforgettable. Overall 4 stars."}
{"text":"This place was epic! 350lbs you eat free. Have to wear a hospital gown to eat in. Wine is served in IV drip bags and if you dont finish your meal you get spanked with a paddle, seen it heard otd..lol"}
{"text":"It's great if you are 350 pounds you eat free otherwise if you are 100 pounds like me you should be ready and hungry and with cash only !...the place is on the corner of Freemont st looks a bit run down from the outside when you walk in the attendant is dressed as a nurse walks you back and puts some gowns on you then sits you ...there are no salads very limited Menu and it's limited to Hot Dog and HamBurgers and you must eat all that you order or at the end you get spanked with a paddle ! Fun concept but be there hungry and the girls whatever and videos are cheesy ...other than the food was not bad !"}
{"text":"Ahhh the infamous Heart Attack Grill.  Listen, I am all for food that is bad for you.  There is a place in this world for it, and I will defend that place in the world as I would defend my own country from invasion.  However, when food is not good for you, it better taste good.  This is the failure of the Heart Attack Grill.   -When a burger is 8000,6000,4000, or 2000 calories, it better be in the top 10 of all time burgers. This is more like the bottom 10.  The burgers here are SOOOOOO GREASY.  If I went back I'd ask them for some burger with my grease.  Now let me say, I'm not that guy who wipes off his greasy food with a napkin and THEN eats. When I seek out grease, bring it on. But the burger is so thoroughly and completely greased inside and out that there is no burger taste. Pure disappointment.  -The fries, cooked in pure lard, were actually excellent. I almost gave this place 2 stars for that, but then I realized this is actually why I am giving it 1 star.  -I do like the coke bottled in Mexico with actual sugar, not corn syrup or whatever the hell we use here. That was a plus.  -I don't smoke, so I did not partake of the unfiltered lucky strike lung darts.  -The wait staff. Wow, they aren't wearing much. We had a cute waitress, who would sit on the counter, and my sister realized that more of her butt was in contact with the counter than not. She was playing the role well. Flirty, dingy. There were some other waitresses that were probably 20 years her elder. I will not comment further for fear it may incriminate me.  -The atmosphere.....White and Red, like In N Out or 5 Guys Burgers. Wheelchairs for people who eat triple or quadruple bypasses. What no Lipitor? I would bet money that the scary dude who sat next to us ogling the cute waitress for an hour was registered in the state as a sex offender, or at least on some FBI watch-list.   I will leave you with the following thought as you ponder my lack of recommendation for The Heart Attack Grill.  Someone said this place makes Hooters look classy. ACTUALLY this place makes the Crazy Horse Too in Las Vegas look classy."}
{"text":"Heart Attack Grill falls in the fun category.  It is fun to go once! I would not go again.  We had the joy of witnessing a person \"win\" a free dinner for weighing over 350lbs!! Win is a very loosely used term in the case :)  The food is average, this is more about the experience. During dinner you are dressed in surgical overalls and served by sexy nurses.  Warning! Failing to finish what you order results in a spanking with a leather belt!  We had the single burger + bacon (if bacon is not an option it is mandatory), Fries (extremely salty) and the butter shake (comes with a knob of butter on top)  The burger and shake were average, no regrets. The fries I would not recommend they are sooo salty!  Enjoy the weigh in before and after eating! :)"}
{"text":"This is a must do once for entertainment purposes.   Start off with the Pros:  Neat place, clean, neat uniforms, fun/friendly staff, the Doctor shows up in person (star of the episode) allowing pictures, BEST MILKSHAKE ever! Cons: food is average for no reason.   The food needs to take on an upscale bar food flavor vice out of the can processed.   This can be done easily making people want to come more than once:)   We had fun!"}
{"text":"Definitely a restaurant with a gimmick. The food wasn't bad nothing that really made me feel like I needed to go back except for the milkshake, and the wine Iv bags. Came with friends had a really fun time!!! Liked that they make sure you don't get your clothes dirty!"}
{"text":"To begin with, I'd like to say that I'd actually like to give this place 3.5 stars. # is just a little too short, but 4 is a bit too much. For once, I'll err on the side of conservatism.  The bottom line: This place makes a decent burger, and it is what it says it is: a place for purely unhealthy food. You know what you're getting going in, and that's not a bad thing if that's what you want, at least once in a while. Everything in moderation, even overindulgence.  That said, \"moderation\" isn't exactly what this place is about. Although you can get a few other menu items, the mainstay is burgers, which you can get up to 8 patties (at least on the menu; I'm sure you can go off the menu and request more). I had the Double Heart Attack with fries and a Coke. You have an option to get bacon on the burger, which actually comes with veggies (lettuce, tomato, and lettuce), along with cheese and chili, but I declined the 10 slices that get added to this particular version. Maybe some other trip.   And I didn't quite get what I expected. I expected some small \"tourist-size\" thing. But this was a big fat two-hander on a sturdy, yet tasty bun. It was actually heavy to lift. Rather than ladling in on so in becomes an eat-with-your-fork meal, the amount of chili was just right, a layer the size of a tomato slice. And it was quite good as well, enhancing the already tasty meat. I asked about the chili and it is not canned, but locally made. By not trying to go \"gourmet\" or \"upscale\" and by not being chintzy with the meat (as you might expect a tourist place in Vegas to do), this turns out to be one of the better burgers in Vegas. Especially as it was late in the afternoon and I'd not had lunch (deliberately, planning for this trip), I was able to finish with room to spare.   Which is a good thing, as it appears that there are consequences of not finishing your meal.   The fries, meh. Freshly cut potatoes, it appears, but not a significant amount, and a bit too heavy on the oil. Get past the oil and they are fairly tasty.  Not being a drinker of alcohol, my beverage options were limited. For soft drinks they have one item: old fashioned bottles of Coca Cola with real sugar, known to some as \"Mexican Coke.\" I was able to stretch the one bottle for the entire meal, and was pleasantly surprised to seen the final total at \"just\" $15, which for Vegas is a very good deal.  About those consequences. Being the \"heart Attack Grill,\" there's a whole medical theme going. The waitresses, seemingly hot young vixens all, are in nurse's uniforms with the typical Vegas waitress short skirts. The bartender was a very friendly and personable bald man, quick to smile, excellent with the service, and dressed in a doctor's lab coat complete with stethoscope around his neck. (When I was ready to order, I at first said, in the most serious voice I could muster, \"I'll have the salad.\" He looked at me mor a moment, then pointed and said \"Get out!\" then grinned, and I just couldn't keep a straight face at the point myself.) When you enter, you are given a hospital-like wristband and a patient's gown to wear.  And apparently, if you don't finish your massive burger, you'll get spanked by one of the waitresses with a big fat paddle. You might even get one to spank you if you do finish, and pictures of this, uh, abuse seem to be welcome. You can buy a paddle, or even a copy of the menu ($1) if you like. However the business is cash only, ostensibly to make sure your tab is paid should the Heart Attack Grill experience actually give you a heart attack. Interestingly, the bottom of the menu has a snarky conservative-leaning comment about having to pay the sales tax to the government, a not uncommon sentiment with Nevadans, but just days after the Boston bombers were found, cornered, and captured, it occurs to me that those taxes pay for, among other things, the local, state, and federal law enforcement that effected their capture. And that is not a bad thing at all.   As it says on big neon signs on the outside,if you weigh more than 350 lb. *they have scales to check), you can eat for free (provided you buy a beverage). That's an interesting little gimmick that, fortunately, most people cannot partake of.  All-in-all, this is an experience worth repeating, and worth a trip to downtown."}
{"text":"Such a cool experience The food was decent but the experience itself was great  Worth going to They smack your butt with a wooden thing if you don't finish your food and film it - different  Definitely a fun experience in Vegas"}
{"text":"This place had been here for a while, so I thought I'd give it a try.  My only satisfaction was that I can check this off my list.  I ordered a hotdog because, yes, they do swat you if you don't finish your food...but ew. The \"nurse\" was understanding and gave me a pass on the swats."}
{"text":"Terrible effin service they do not care about their patrons at all and this review is only for that. I wasn't able to taste the gimmicky heart attack food because they basicaly kicked us out due to the fact that they didn't have the air on (in vegas in june)  and my mother who is middle aged couldn't stand how hot it was with the stupid hospital gown on. She even told the retard who called herself the manager (Dr. outfit) that she was menopausal and couldn't stand how hot it was in there with the nasty gown on. The lady tells us o well if you want to stay here and eat you have to keep the gown on, it's our #1 rule, no gown you can't stay... it was already embarrasing for my mom to disclose that info and this chick just went HAM about her keeping it on, and said if it was too hot with the gown on we had to leave (wtf) This place sucks and it's not even worth the experience, they put these nasty ass gowns on that have been on other patrons all day, and night and make you wear them the entire time you're there, and if you don't eat all your food they spank you with a paddle. If you're drunk enough or a frat boy under 20 i'd assume this place would be fun, we've passed the place many times and i thought the theme was cute but the service really was terrible."}
{"text":"Anxious to try since the Dallas location closed down before I could visit. The gluttony is played to the extreme, and you can definitely taste the Lard, especially in the Chili, but it's a fun experience and we thoroughly enjoyed everything. The Hamburger patties are pretty thin, and most of the flavor comes from the toppings. I had a Coronary Dog, which was quite good, actually - albeit, probably 5,000 calories! Flatline Fries are covered in (sliced) Cheese and Chili and are good, but the Lard flavor in the chili leaves a strange feeling in the mouth. Bring cash! They only accept cash, so plan ahead if you visit."}
{"text":"By far the best burgers in Vegas!!! Yes the portions are huge and they fat content not to be looked at if your wanting to enjoy your self. But a must got to place if yo like people watching and your really hungry after a long walk down Fremont!!! They serve your 24oz. beers in brown paper sacks and love that they do not add any \"special sauce\" to the bun! The fries may sound like an awful mixture but they are crispy and tasty! A must addition to you burger is the BACON!!! Bun is huge and soft and lite doesn't weigh down the burger! We will be back its a fun place....DONT FORGET TO BRING CASH!!!! they have an ATM there...."}
{"text":"Gimmicky?  Yes, but this place is genuinely fun.  When we first moved to Las Vegas I was amazed how many friends asked us about it.  We made a point to go and had a blast.  The food is well-prepared and tasty--no surprise since it's made with all the stuff that ensures lots of flavor!  The restaurant itself is clean and entertaining, with several scales around for customers to weigh in, and waitresses dressed to play their parts as nurses ensuring we receive the full treatment of deliciousness.  The walls are decorated with movie posters modified to match the theme of the restaurant and there are enough TVs mounted high to ensure everyone gets to enjoy rock videos and parody songs that feature the staff!  I recently went back with several friends and if anything, it's even better.  If you have friends in town, don't miss taking them to experience this unique eatery.  Be sure to bring your appetite and a camera, and afterwards, stroll around Fremont Street.  Tasty, gratuitous fun!"}
{"text":"Reviewer # 809  Where do I start?!? Well, first off, this place is so terrible its AMAZING and where else other than Vegas?  It's right on Freemont St in old town Vegas. This was my second time visiting HAG, but first at this location. I posted lots of photos for you to view. Walk in and get your hospital gown on.  ****CAUTION**** There is nothing healthy here. You will not find any veggies, diet soda, or meat alternatives. It is an unhealthy place to eat and caters to that. For that reason, I didn't eat anything when I was here this time, but I did in the past and it was very flavorful. I've been watching my health and wasn't going to let Vegas take that and my money from me! However, it was important that I take my friends there because it is oh-so-fun!   If you're over 350 pounds you eat for free. You must get up on the stage, have all eyes on you as your nurse says something like \"attention... we have a challenge to eat for free\" then people 350+ get on the scale. If you're over the 350 you are treated like royalty... kinda neat... kinda morbid... kinda not cool... kinda cool! What do you think?  They are in the Guinness Book of World Records for the most caloric burger. They have doubled that since then but the first record stands so they haven't needed to reclaim their place. Get yourself an IV wine bag, a juicy burger, and a near butter thick shake! You better plan to either walk or sleep it off, cause you're gonna be sleepy!   Be sure to check out my many photos. Oh and make sure you eat all your food. Unless you want to be SPANKED!"}
{"text":"Burgers are actually pretty damn good! Delicious even! Maybe its all the fatty additives.. I am a small woman but managed to eat a whole single bypass burger with a side of fries! It was good!  Everything about this restaurant was absolutely hilarious, from the menu and décor to the spankings! I was surprised that they actually spank people pretty hard. You will not be forced to be spanked though, you can opt out of course. Our nurse was amazing, and super friendly!  I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a good laugh! And the burgers aren't bad either. The pricing is definitely reasonable. The only bad thing is that it will take weeks to burn the calories off."}
{"text":"We liked the place....fun, Excellent fries, rings, and shakes....Burgers were WAY over cooked. If they cooked the burgers right, this place would be great."}
{"text":"Why would anyone give this place more than 1 star? How is this place even open still? SERIOUSLY?! Ew.  Ok, yes I understand it's Vegas and it's fun. I'll give it that. The gowns are fun to dress up in- they do very well with the theme. That is how they got one star from me.  However, they advertise \"taste worth dying for\".... WTF are they smoking? There is SO MUCH potential for this place if they had decent food.   I've had my share of fatty foods. They usually taste better than skinny people food. If all fast food tasted like this, I think the obesity epidemic would be solved. No one would want to eat this crap.   This place was an embarrassment to fatty foods everywhere. Other places'  fries that are fried in animal fat= amazing. Why? Because they are crispy and delicious. They are fried first in oil and then in duck fat. HAG misses the extra step and just fries their fries in lard in lard. Lard burns at too low of a temperature and cannot \"FRY\" fries.  HAG fries are limp, soggy, and burned ( AND luke warm). Gross.  The burger... 59 cent dry stale bun + overcooked basically unseasoned meat + bacon that was chewy and luke warm (somehow it was stale too) = disappointment.   It's not even a tiny bit delicious. It is disgusting and they don't even try. The whole restaurant is constantly advertising how amazing the food is and how it's food worth dying for. No- it's definitely worth avoiding though."}
{"text":"I took some out-of-towners here recently -- at their insistence. I was a little less enthralled the 2nd time around. The amusement of eating at a place called Heart Attack Grill that makes you wear a hospital gown and whose servers are dressed as nurses is only good for one visit. The next time, like me, you may only just shrug your shoulders.  Still, it's not a bad burger. But, I wouldn't call it good either. But, it was deliciously gooey with cheese, and the flavor of the meat was decent. The fries are still pretty tasty, natural cut & fried in lard. Overall though...I can think of a lot of other places I'd rather have a burger.  Bottom line: Heart Attack Grill is a novelty. The actual food is just okay -- no need to dis it; we've all had worse and better. But, I'd rather have great food than a great gimmick."}
{"text":"Ok so I first introduce this place to my friends a few years ago after we did a marathon and we were driving back from New Mexico. At that time the Arizona location was the only one open. We went there and after doing 26.2 miles a few thousand cal why not. We all meet Doc and told him we just came in for some burger and we were all hooked. My other friends went to the Texas location when it was open. Now that Vegas is the only one now it's nice that some of the original staff followed. If you want something completely different and know that sometimes the unhealthy is the best tasting food come here. It's a man's burger pick it up and grease just all over your hands, milkshakes so thick you need a spoon to eat them. I been to the Vegas location at least 4-5 time already. As long as it's open I will come back."}
{"text":"We had no idea what we were getting into ... eating in a hospital gown and having \" nurses \" serve us was so awesome and fun ! There was karaoke and crowd participation ! Food was amazing I don't recommend ordering a double burger  bc if you don't finish it you get spanked by your server"}
{"text":"Food is subpar, Meat is dry, overcooked. Fries were decent, but avoid the onion rings at all costs. They are cooked in straight lard and it's one of the worst things I've ever had. The chili comes from a bag that was probably defrosted in a microwave that morning and slopped into a pail over a stove.   This place is marketed to fatties. If you're fat and you have no shame, you'll love it. Stretch those sweats and dig in. If you're a normal human being you'll just get a laugh out of the gimmick.   Two stars, one for making me chuckle, and one for the waitresses who at least have a sense of humor about all of it."}
{"text":"A few bites from our full review -   \"Before ordering, we took our time to go through the elaborate menu with tinker-bell sized pinup girls all over, and quirky writing throughout. Note, their only vegetarian option is cigarettes - keeping it healthy!\" \"Our Single Bypass Burger on the other hand was more pleasant. It had chili, onion, tomatoes, and cheese with meat full of cartilages and fat.\""}
{"text":"Other than the fat worried this place is cool. Lola was cool and sexy girl she is ;-)"}
{"text":"I'm sorry this place is gross. I've been there twice. It's a fun idea with the hospital gowns and hospital bracelet and such. Cute idea. But the food is severely over priced and disgusting. I've yet too ever finish my burger, which is sad because who doesn't love a bacon burger?  I just can't ever seem to chock  down the over cooked dry a$$ burger. Just nasty. The staff isn't that friendly or accommodating. They rarely come by your table to check to see if you need a refill.  So if you're on Fremont street. Pop your head in maybe come in for an over priced soda to get the hospital gown bracelet wearing experience.  Other than that keep walking. The food is wretched. Save your money for gambling."}
{"text":"Located in downtown Las Vegas there's definitely a different vibe. More small town, less glamorous and quaint, at least in comparison to what it feels like on the strip. You will see right on the corner, the famous heart attack grill.  This place is a nightmare for anyone who is trying to lose weight, stay healthy or even count calories. But, it's a great place for the experience and novelty, it was featured in many tv shows!  As you enter the facility, you are greeted by the sexy nurses who give you a general run down of the place. After you are clothed in a gown, you are seated and shown a menu filled with empty calories and lard.  The only burger you were allowed to share is the single (2,500 calories), if you are brave enough to order something else, you might have to prepare yourself for a spanking!  The burger was heavy... Because there was no lettuce, it felt oily and filled with meat. It tasted good, but it left me feeling fat. The onion rings were good and also very oily.   Overall a fun experience and a decent place to dine, but definitely not a place I would like to revisit.  Note: It's Cash Only, if you weigh more than 350 lbs. you eat for free, and you are not allowed to bring your own beverage, and water is only served bottled."}
{"text":"WOW. THE ONLY THING THAT IS KEEPING THESE GUYS OPEN IS THEIR LOCATION AND FOOD NETWORK FAME.  Most of their customers are mainly gonna be tourists and first timers. Located in a busy part of the Fremont Street Experience, the name of the restaurant and the words \"350 Pounds and Over Eat Free\" are definite eye catchers.  The Heart Attack Grill or \"HAG\" as it's come to be known, has actually lived up to it's namesake with actual heart attack incidents. As a matter of fact, while I am typing this review, I find out the unofficial spokesperson for HAG has died from you guessed it, an apparent heart attack.  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20130212/nv-heart-attack-grill-heart-attack/?utm_hp_ref=politics&ir=politics  This place must be bad because I have gone at least 3 paragraphs before even having to mention their food. Ok, quick descriptions. They cook their beef patties and fries with lard. Their milkshakes have actual butter in them. Literally they have a little stick of butter right on top of it sticking out. Now I know the fat is what makes most greasy food taste good but in this case the grease is highly overpowering.  Service is decent. Yeah you got scantily clad female nurses as your servers but this is Vegas. Nothing should surprise you. Well, maybe except for when you see guys getting spanked by them with wooden paddles because it's their birthday. You can actually get spanked if you ask nicely. No special occasion necessary.  Of course everybody's number one complaint is that they take cash only. Of course there is an ATM available but you get charged up the arse just in fees alone. FAIL.  So overall, most people come just for the shock value. Meaning they are shocked when they shouldnt be when they find out there has been several heart attack incidents. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED."}
{"text":"Don S's review below is right on point.   I love places that are out of the norm and this place fits the bill. I heard about it quite some time ago on the Food Network and pledged to eat there one day.   Well, today I was in Phoenix and my brother drove us.  We had a great time. Huge, GREASY, 1/2 poind patties on large, GREASY, buns served with GREASY cheese. You won't find lettuce here, but you can add all the pickles, jalapenos, tomatoes and onions you want.   Fries? They were GREASY.... but fried in REAL GREASE. Fries cooked in hot lard. I don't know what trans-fat looks like but I'm sure these fries are the poster children for unhealthily cooked food.  We each had a Double Bypass and they were great. I'd recommend leaving off all the condiments and veggies so you can just savor this GREASE soaked piece of heaven. I could have gone for a Triple, but in retrospect, my heart is probably happy that I didn't. If you order the Quadruple, they wheel you out in a wheelchair. (seriously, they do)  Sugar laden Coca-Cola in large bottles, water and Margaritas are your choices for drinks.  All in all, this is a unique food joint that you have to experience at least once in your life. It was fun, tasty, GREASY and reasonably priced. You will never forget it. I know I won't."}
{"text":"The buttermilk milk shakes are fabulous. There is enough for 2 people to share!"}
{"text":"Great novelty place to eat but not recommend dining here all the time because it can be hazardous to your health.  This can only exist in Las Vegas. I was in Vegas celebrating my birthday and had my 21 year old nephew with me. We have been having fun and came here to continue the party.  If you have never been I think you need to go at least once in your life.  If you aren't familiar with this place they boast about having the world highest caloric content burger. The portion sizes are gigantic.  I think they do it so you are guaranteed not to finish. In the event you don't complete your meal you will get a spanking. It's a find place for a meal. They only take cash so make sure you bring some."}
{"text":"Place is a joke! They DO NOT accept cash (Probably trying to report less profit to pay less taxes) I don't know any place that doesn't accept cards now days. Even a small business has a square card reader on their phone. This place takes down your order on their little phone thing, so there's no excuse for that. Which by the way, takes them forever to take your order on, it would be a lot faster if they just wrote it down.   I'm not %100 on Las Vegas Law, but I am pretty sure it is illegal to charge for water if you serve alcohol in your establishment. A friend of mine asked for a Water and was denied any free waters but had to pay for a bottled water. That is crazy.  Now the service was horrible, it could have just been our server because everyone else around seemed to be getting faster service. The burgers are \"ok\", nothing great, the gimmick is they are just loaded with tons of bacon.  Highly recommend you choose a different place. This place is just popular because it was on TV and because the FREE FOOD over 350 pounds so everyone want's to see what the hype is about. It is nothing great at all. AVOID!"}
{"text":"The food is great. I love the chocolate shake!    Two complaints: 1. I'm not a fan of it being a cash only place since I don't like to carry cash.   2.this is not a place to take your kids. I'm not a fan of the nurse's outfits and the ensuing spankings if you don't eat your meal. I admit it made me a little uncomfortable.   It is also a pricey establishment, but I think that needs to be expected if you're eating in a location where it's at.   I think this is a place you should go at least once for the experience, just don't take your kids."}
{"text":"This place was totally entertaining. From the hospital gown you have to wear once you walk in the door to the witty commentary on the menu to the sassy servers. The burgers and fries were what I think my grandma would make in her kitchen in the deep fryer and frying pan. They were good and didn't taste like most commercialized hamburgers and fries you get everywhere else. The milkshake was the best milkshake ever (according to my wife). If you love butter then you will love the milkshakes. I'm happy to finally find a place that serves food you want to eat and not care about whether it's healthy. Bring cash, or use the ATM at the door because they don't take cards."}
{"text":"I came here because a group of us were downtown.  When I entered I thought that it was a stupid gimik but I went a long with it because I was hungry and in a hurry.   We ordered our food and when it arrived it wasn't the greatest.  It didn't taste that great and the atmosphere was cheesy.    While we were eating we heard a couple come in and ask to be seated.  The nurse at the front told them that they would have to put on a hospital gown.  The girl in the couple looked at the gowns and noticed that they weren't clean.  Thats when I looked mine over and noticed that she was right.  She immediately said that because she has been diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder; she shouldn't be forced to wear that.  I know someone who lives with that disorder so I know that they have high anxiety when it comes to cleanliness.  The nurse argued with her until the girl asked to talk to a manager.  The nurse yelled across the restaurant to an old guy in a Dr outfit who claimed he owned the place.    He arrogantly asked \"what's the problem,\" in the same tone the nurse was having with the two patrons.  The girl stated that she didn't want to wear the medical gown because she didn't trust how clean it was and the manager said, \"leave then!\"    The girl responded, \"you would rather us eat somewhere else instead of voting with our dollars here?\"  The so called manager started to get in both of the couples faces in an aggressive manner.  The male part of the couple was just standing there and didn't say a word until the manager started to make the couple feel apprehensive. The old manager then threatened the guy after the couple had exited the front door.  Thats when the guy started to stand his ground and call the manager out as a coward.  The guy told the manager to come at him if he wanted to threaten him otherwise he should go back inside and eat a %@)#.  \"You obviously like a lot of meat in your mouth.\"  I started rolling after that and expected the manager to do something.    I thought the situation absurd because the so called 'owner' threatened a couple who wanted to pay to eat at his horrible restaurant.  Then when the manager was bowed up to, he had to cowar back and close the door.    I wont be coming back to this place after the way I saw patrons were treated and after I saw that the restaurant won't make exceptions for someone who has been diagnosed with a disability.   The \"owner\" made the situation worse and made himself look like a coward."}
{"text":"ya, only go here if you love great burgers, fries, shakes, liquor, atmosphere, service/staff, reasonable prices, and hot chicks ;)"}
{"text":"OMG.  Look, I'm a big, fat, slob. I didn't get this way by eating salads, 'k? So, when it comes to burgers, fries, and milkshakes, I know what I'm talking about.   And this is the best damned burger in the world. Everything was delicious. Sure, the butter on the milkshake was over-the-top, but, hey, that's their gimmick. It's worth taking the time, trouble, and energy to find parking and get there; I loved every bite."}
{"text":"A fun place to eat if you get the point of the place.  Anyone who takes this place seriously needs to get their head examined.  It's a parody of Murica! Have a good time, eat lots of nasty food and when you get home hit the gym and don't eat so much crap.  I got the double bypass and a butterfat shake.  The burger was good and props to whoever they get their buns from, in that it was able to withstand the juices of the burger without falling apart.  The shake was awesome.  My wife ordered from the vegan menu with two vodka Jell-O shots administer with an oral syringe.  They did the job.  I recommend you just don't be a humorless whiner wuss and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"This place looked very cool, the 80s themed music and decor was cool. It was a little weird having to gown up and I saw several people leave due to this akward moment. We were sat quickly and then it began.  Cash only, bottled water, super greasy onion rings, burger was so so. Over cooked and chili tasted off. I finished mine so the black guy with a paddle did not spank me with it. Upside, super hot shapely young waitresses , great chocolate shake.  Mediocre food.  Save your money and go to Five Guys."}
{"text":"BEST BURGERS EVER!!!!! Everyone in my group loved this place so much that we went twice! Highly recommend!!! The vanilla milk shake is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"This place has \"dude's diner\" and \"meat & potatoes man\" written all over it.  The menu is simple; burgers, fries, shakes, full sugared soda, bad beer and bottled water...don't even think to ask for tap water because you can't get it.  All the burgers vary by size; single, double, triple, quadruple, etc.  Changing only by how many strips of bacon, slices of cheese or burger patties are stacking between the two buns.    I actually lost my appetite before it came time to order.  I could only muster a bite of the hubby's single bypass and a lone french fry, solely tasting for review sake.  I can honestly say the food is trash.  The burger was actually worse than McDonald's and the fries were a joke...so not worth paying $2 for fries off their entirely ala carte menu.  The fries were not at all fresh and I almost wished they deep fried them in bacon fat rather than lard because there would have at least been some flavor to them.  And salt, they desperately needed salt...but no amount of salt could have salvaged the stale, bland taste of those fries.  The whole place is one big joke; from the giant weigh scale at the front door, to the patient hospital gowns patrons must wear and the nurse and doctor uniforms on all the wait staff.  The restaurant is very thematic, they knock it outta the park on that point and I loved the humor in the reciept.  But that's where my love died...of a heart attack.  Cash only."}
{"text":"I remember seeing this place on the Food Network and thought it would be pretty cool to go there. When I actually finally got to try it, I was disappointed.   When you first go in, they put you in a scrub and it's mandatory. It was a little annoying because I had layers on because it was like 40 degrees outside and adding the scrub on top of my clothes was going to be restricting when I eat. I didn't even want to take my jacket off because I'd still be freezing. Plus it's a little annoying in general because it's so tedious and all you really wanna do is eat.   Let me remind you that this is a themed restaurant. A medical/ hospital themed where the employees have a nurse uniform and a doctor uniform. And the setting of the place was new and interesting which is why gave it 2 stars. This place is more of an experience than it's food.   Now the food.. The food was bland. Bland. Bland. It was not that great. I've had better burgers than that. The onion rings were the only flavorful thing they had. Though I did like their mango dreamsicle. They are pretty strict with their menu but the way it was setup was cool. You can't have this, you can't have that, we don't have this, we don't have that. Like my aunt asked for hot water because it helps with her stomach and our server was like, \"Nope! We have this water bottle.\" I don't really know. I felt like our server was kinda rude anyways. I feel like the people work there think there think they're hot shit but I mean whatever I guess. Oh yeah. If you don't finish your food, you get spanked.  Overall experience was okay. Ambiance was the only thing that gave this rating 2 stars. Like I said, food was bland. Workers were kinda annoying. And it's cash only. I felt like they did too much with this concept. It's not as great as it seems to be. I personally wouldn't want to eat here again unless I have people out of town coming here that wants to try it."}
{"text":"Yay once again we got to make a stop at this hilarious joint. We brought our son who was more than happy to eat a yummy burger & fries. However he was a no go on the spanking. This time around I had the cheeseburger it was darn good. The only reason my review is not a 5, well they only take cash."}
{"text":"Saw this place on t.v . so many times when growing up, o when work had me staying at a hotel only about a 5 minute walk away I decided to try it if only for the experience. Staff was used to answering customers questions and attentive to our needs, so points for that. However, this place only accepts cash and can get pretty pricey if you don't know how big the portions are. However that said, the portions are large and extremely filling ( had the double bypass and fries). All in all its a tourist trap with decent food (kinda above average) and a great location, if nothing else you should try it once."}
{"text":"I saw this place online somewhere, the whole concept is marketed pretty well.  The only downfall(the most important one) is that the food sucks, the only thing that doesn't suck is the mexican coke with real cane sugar !!! But heart attack grill doesn't even make the coke, so they pretty much just suck.   If the burger actually tasted good, it would be unhealthy if you ate all of it.  But since the burger has no taste, and is just a piece of cooked meat on a huge bun, with a few measly pieces of tomato, there is nothing that would really make you want to go back.   I had the 1/2 lb. burger, and ate the entire burger but didn't eat 1/2 of the bun.  I only ate the burger because I paid for it, and I was hungry, or else I probably wouldn't have even eaten it.   The fries are soggy and gross.  I don't usually add salt on my food, but I had to put salt on these fries to eat them, and they were still pretty gross.   I was going to order a milkshake, but the milkshake was in such a small cup that there was no justifying the $5 price tag.   The only novelty in this restaurant is the scale outside the door, and the slutty nurse costumes that the waitresses must wear.   The waitresses are friendly, and the owner is the doctor looking man with the stethoscope around his neck.   We came in on Friday around 6pm, and there were only 30 or so patrons in a room meant for at least 75.... they should probably improve their food, and add more items to the ( 5 item menu) or I don't see why anyone would bother coming back."}
{"text":"Only go here once for the experience. It is fun but the food is not that good.  You get to choose only hamburgers and hotdogs.  The fun part is wearing a hospital gown so feel free to make a mess!  If you don't finish your burger, they will spank you!  They even serve their fattening shakes with a pat of butter, yuck.   CASH ONLY Here!"}
{"text":"So, this place can only exist in Vegas! The fact that the nurses (servers) paddle patrons is AWESOME but probably wouldn't go over so well anywhere else. Lol loved the hospital gowns you have to wear, and hey, it protects your outfit! The menu is simple but legit: heart attack waiting to happen. The burger I ordered (one party only lol) was surprisingly good but I wouldn't call it the best burger I have ever had. The onion rings are a huge portion...insert your arteries clogging here. Two of us shared it and there were still more than half of the order left. The Blond Nurse beer is great and the best part, I got to sing karaoke on stage baby!!!! I showed them what's up!! Love it!!!"}
{"text":"The theme was cool, and I liked the 80's music videos playing; but the food was not good! The meat was poor quality and over cooked. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I enjoy the gimmicks of this place but there is absolutely no way I can actually endorse Heart Attack Grill in good conscience .  I went with my bachelor party group and everyone ordered except me. I just wanted to throw up a little upon seeing and smelling the 'heart-attack' items. Our server was friendly too, but even my own ass was not sparred from the beat down I received. If you don't finish your food, you get spanked. Apparently if you don't order any food, you still get spanked.  HOORAY!  If I really wanted to give myself a heart attack, there are way better enjoyable alternatives. For those of you who want to witness the brutality I suffered in the restaurant, please watch the video I have attached to my review."}
{"text":"Me and my husband were so excited to come to this place because they had been featured on some our favorite food shows! We drove from California to Vegas and the first night there decided to eat there! This was on July 3rd. The place smelled horrible, they made us wear these gross medical gowns, which smelled like they hadn't been washed. But we ignored the fact and were excited to try to food! My husband ordered the 3x3, he loves burgers, he took about 2 bites and whispered to me that he couldn't eat anymore because the burger was so horrible tasting, full of fats and chewy like rubber with little to no taste. I'm vegetarian and was sooooooo disappointed! There was no options for me at all! You would think they would have a veggie patty for the burgers at least??? But no! So i ordered a milkshake and fries, the fries were decent....but their chocolate shake nearly made me vomit, it was so bitter it tasted like 100% cocoa, no sweet typical milkshake taste! And to top this horrible experience off all the ladies that worked there acted they were miserable and didn't want to be there, they never checked on our table and the music they played was just awful. Very disappointed and definitely will NOT be going there when visiting Vegas again."}
{"text":"First off I don't think this place is supposed to have the best burger. I give this place 5 stars because the environment is awesome, beer giant burgers, doctor waiters, nurses paddle your but if you don't finish your food or just for the fun if it. It's cash only just burgers and fries, and a giant hot dog. The art around the restraunt is super cool. If u weigh more then 350. Lbs u eat free"}
{"text":"3 stars for entertainment and the creativity built around the restaurant.  Our server/nurse was a delight, always checking with us and interacting with us.  Yes it was expensive hamburger joint.  But just visit once and it would be enough to make your visit to Vegas wonderful.    The family joke we had was that we had more fun at the Heart Attack Grill than the buffet at the Wynn!  Ha!"}
{"text":"Get the single cheeseburger with bacon and fries!  So greasy but oh so yummy! I ate half of my food, because it was sooooo BIG!  Definitely a fun place to go with a group.  Check out the men's bathroom, just sayin its hillarious!  They place you on a gown as if you're going into the hospital. THe servers are dressed in sexy nurse outfits and they give shots.. whatever u want."}
{"text":"They'll get ya into a hospital gown, give you some high calorie, high stacked burgers! That If you don't finish... YOU GET SPANKED!  Chocolate, vanilla or strawberry alcoholic triple shop milkshakes for 12.00!  Weigh 350 pounds or more  YOU EAT FOR FREE! Haha VEGAS!  The girls wear nursing costumes and guys in scrubs.. Guys spank girls n vs versa employee to consumer. This place is great! Should stay open later past 11! Till 2 at least  Great spot right on Fremont"}
{"text":"I really thought this place was cool to try. So some friends took us there to try it. Food was good lil pricey on drinks but the thing made me lil mad was i wanted to do a penis shot with my girl toni. However because some1 bitch about its inappropriateness infront of her childern (dnt knw when this all went down) and did it on yelp they stopd doing it. Its an adult themed resturant people NOT FOR YOUNG KIDS. However i loved staff it was great"}
{"text":"I love the experience. The place is super cool. It's definitely like a once in a lifetime experience (or more than once if you like it that much) I went on a date here and he ordered a $25 eight patty burger. I ordered a Dr Pepper which came in a cute little glass. I hate burgers so I just got the chocolate milk shake which was more of a thick frozen yogurt. It was good but I don't think I'd ever go again since I don't like anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Took my son for his birthday and he enjoyed the experience.  From the hospital gowns to the food. Great entertainment and affordable.  I just want to throw this out there.  I am vegetarian, usually I can go to any restaurant and modify things to fit my dietary needs, however, this is NOT VEGETARIAN FRIENDLY, unless you just want to eat a bun.  I thought I could get away with just having fries but then realized the menu noted \"everything is cooked in lard\" which was enough to scare my hunger away.  My son, had a double and an order of fries. He really liked it and it truly was a massive burger.  The whole idea of heart attack grill is fun and I'm glad I went, but I left starving!  Definitely check it out if you're in that area but beware if you are vegetarian."}
{"text":"I seen this place on man versus food, so I was like what the heck I'll give it a try. You walk in and they put a hospital gown on you. All the waitresses are dressed like nurses, and the bartender is the doctor. I know I'm here for the experience so it's all good. I order a jack and coke which my jack came in a pill bottle personalized for me. This is great. The fries are cooked in lard, and there isn't anything good for you on the menu.  If you weigh over 350 lbs you eat for free. If you don't finish your food you get paddled by your waitress (and it goes directly to their website on video). I give it 4 stars because the food was good, but not amazing, yet the experience was one that will last a lifetime.  This IS a cash only place, but they do have an ATM."}
{"text":"My dad wanted to try one of the milkshakes here, that they make with the \"highest butter fat ice cream\" around. Butter only makes things better, right? Umm, not so much...  I walked in to order some shakes to go from the front counter (no one in my party wanted to have to put on a hospital gown to sit down and eat there). The girls working there were super friendly and were happy to let me place a to-go order. But the shakes were just gross. They left a weird, waxy (or maybe buttery?) coating in your mouth and the ice cream was not spectacular.   I get that this place is a gimmick more than a an actual restaurant, but I would recommend saving your time and money for something else. Speaking from just having the nasty shakes, we did not order any burgers."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful, fun experience, from putting on the gowns to enjoying the wall art and the whole concept.  No Diet Drinks it's against their rules was a little disappointing (let me poison myself on aspartame please).  Surprised at \"cash only\" in a large successful place but they're making it.  Laughed from start to finish.  Lots of gown pics, watched several get whacked.  We split a burger and fries-two of us ate for $20 including drinks and tips. Burger cooked well, great condiments (no pickle? boohoo).  Not high quality food--good junk food.   Just a great quirky place for lunch when in a wild city."}
{"text":"this u fun place I enjoyed the burger the fries WAAAY to greasy but hey it's the HEART ATTACK GRILL what do u expect had fun watching people getting spanked and the decor was hilarious  i love the shots that are given in a pill bottle with your name typed on it. I would probably go back again ."}
{"text":"Burgers and service was phenomenal. Definitely get what u pay for and then some if you don't finish your food!!  Word to the wise, never ask for a Diet Coke!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend's sister reallllly wanted to eat here. Upon seeing the outside of the restaurant, I had reservations. It seems so gimmicky, so I assumed the food would be subpar at best.  First off -- before you are taken to your seat, you must wear a hospital gown or your order will not be taken. Be a good sport and put it on, k?  Second -- don't even think about ordering a diet soda or a salad. There are no healthy things on the menu.   You see where I'm going with this, right?  When we sat down and waited for the rest of our table to show up, a young man went to the middle of the dining area with a goofy grin on his face, with a waitress in a nurse's uniform in tow, clutching a paddle. He bent over and took three hard swats to the butt and looked as if he was in heaven. His crime? Not finishing his food. I leaned over to my boyfriend and said \"Oh sh*t! I better finish my burger!! They really put their muscles behind the spankings!!\"  I made the grievous mistake of ordering a chocolate shake as my drink. I drank half before I gave up on it -- it was delicious but super rich (what did I expect?! It came with freaking butter on top!) and I wanted to save room for my burger. BF's sister said the single patty burgers weren't that big. She was wrong. So. Wrong. I finished the meat, but left the bacon, bread and fixings in my basket. Admitting defeat, I took my three licks like a champ, amidst hooting from other patrons and incriminating video footage taken by BF's dad.  The burgers, fries and onion rings are actually very good. Not what I expected. Would I go back? Sure! I'll just skip the milkshake, because that's what put me over the edge. Besides...I need to order some red wine in an awesome looking IV bag!"}
{"text":"Our doctor was sweet and very cute. It was weird at first but after a couple shots I left crying no joke. I don't drink and had a Jell-O shot and a prescription bottle shot. I forgot our doctors name but here is our picture. Great memories were made."}
{"text":"Lola is a hard smacking sweetheart! We're had a great experience and great food!!! This is a great overall restaurant and family fun."}
{"text":"The chocolate shake tasted bland and weird. The burger tasted like cafeteria food. They didn't give you water if you didn't want a coke. They make you wear hospital gowns and I didn't like that because it was choking my neck. It didn't feel like a friendly environment and if anyone goes to Vegas don't come here just go somewhere else"}
{"text":"The only reason it gets 2 stars rather than 1 is because its one of those \"you gota try it\" places.  Truth is its disgusting.  The butter fat shakes taste like they sound, like flavored butter you eat with a spoon.  The lard fries are burnt and taste like hair.  I got the double bypass, it sucked.  No flavor in the meat.  It was just a big fatty tasteless meal.  The only good things were the bacon, the chili and the atmosphere.  Go there take a picture, get a single and split it.  Cross it off the list"}
{"text":"A fun restaurant.  Went with our two older kids and they loved the people watching.  The food is good but simple.  The wine IV is a full bottle so be ready.  The spanking is no joke.  If you don't finish your food your waitress will spank you and it's not a light spank.  Some of the waitresses really knew how to hit and I'm sure their guest went home with a bruise.  Even the tough guys would tear up. It's a cash only place and perfect for those wanting to have fun!"}
{"text":"Family of 5 went to try this \"novelty\" burger place while in town. I expected so much more. The meat in this burger has to be of lowest quality and absolutely no flavor and very strange texture. Go elsewhere if you want a good burger. The plus side is this is the only place around with this type of strange, entertaining theme."}
{"text":"Well,  We knew what we were getting our self into when we decided to try this joint! And we were right, Besides the good looking girls, this place is not that great! Burger was OK, I made it better with the condiments, fries were OK, I did though liked their shakes! Glad we tried it, probably will not come back! But seriously, you get what they advertise!!"}
{"text":"Would have given it 4 stars, however their frozen drinks are lacking in booze. Mighty tasty, but I have doubts on them being the strongest on Fremont. I did get a singl bypass with bacon, and it was AWESOME! I think they forgot to lard up the bun, which contributed to the deliciousness. The theme is awesome, there is a last supper painting with the owner as Jesus, and fast food characters as the disciples. I will go back for another burger, I might choose a different type of booze this time."}
{"text":"It didn't live up to the hype.. Burger was mediocre at best, fries were super meh. Cash only. The videos were downright creepy with poor CGI overlay of some doctor dude and some of the employees.... doctor dude has has a creepy stare. All in all I came, I saw, I ate, I went 'meh' and I left."}
{"text":"It's a novelty fun place that put a hospital gown on you when you walk in and if you don't finish your food you will be paddled.. It's pretty much burgers they are good it's just a fun place..hey your in Vegas have fun.."}
{"text":"Very interesting experience. Food was not the greatest. Very greasy. But I guess it says it will be in the name. Must wear a hospital gown and eat all your food.. Or else..."}
{"text":"This place is an awesome experience!! Don't expect much for variety as their menu is strictly burgers & fries & bacon & chili smothered all over!! Everything is made with butter & if you have $30 to blow on a photo opportunity and want to feed the homeless later, then I definitely recommend the \"octuple bypass burger\" with 150 slices of bacon, which is 20,000 calories!!! And if you don't finish your meal, you get a good old fashioned paddling at the end  for all you 50 shades of black type of people lol"}
{"text":"All gimmick. Only thing nice here is the servers and the atmosphere but then again, we came for some juicy and unhealthy burger and fries. While it's a fun experience, the food was so disappointing. Meats were dry and the fries were soak as if they were fried in lard/oil that wasn't hot. Come here once for fun? yes. Come here again to eat? hell no."}
{"text":"If you are seeking good quality food, I would probably give this place a miss. If you are seeking a novelty restaurant with a few laughs, give it a go.   This is a place where you can be rewarded for, or even to the extent of encouraged for being fat. If you are over a certain weight, you actually get to eat here for free - crazy, yes I know!!!  You and your fellow guests will be dressed in hospital garments, fed EXTREMELY unhealthy food - very sickening the sizes of burgers that are available here. You can drink wine from an intravenous drip, syringe filled with vodka, and get spanked from waitresses dressed up in nurses uniforms for not finishing your dinner.   As a novelty, maybe one time visit, by all means drop in & have a laugh, however I am sure you wouldn't be coming back on a regular occurrence."}
{"text":"We ate there yesterday and it was great!  The food was great and the staff was very friendly. Tracy the manager/ head nurse was great and gave us a great history on the place. It was fun and I'm glad I got this on my bucket list. Get a shake"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place! It's an experience; you'll never forget and you won't find another place like it! By the looks of the outside, we weren't sure if we wanted to go in! However, it was completely worth the chance! I absolutely Love this place! From the greeting at the front, the restrooms, the drinks and all the action that goes on! I do Not recommend children; this is more of an adult burger place.. I also highly recommend making sure you Eat everything in your plate!"}
{"text":"Having heard of this place on TV (Food network, I think) and my son who goes to school in AZ, the whole family, including my vegetarian only wife, just 'had' to try the place.   I would say that the place pretty much lives up to its name as being a gut busting, caloric inducing burger joint. Not for the faint of heart, I just got a single burger (is that what they call them?), fries, a coke, and shared my wife's Vanilla shake.  I must have ate/drank over 3k worth of calories in one sitting.   I am an avid runner with a half marathon, 10k's, etc under my belt and I just had to run a full marathon (26.2 miles) the next day to cleanse myself of what I ate the day before. I really didn't run a marathon the next day, but like one reviewer said, \"The next morning, most of us who'd eaten there were still full.\"   Would I eat there again? Sure, next year as its a great place to go to check out if you are in the area, but part of your regular diet, no way! But don't think my review is all about hating the joint, it's a great place. I even talked to the \"doctor' himself and had dreams of expanding. With America's gluttony, I think he might even be successful at it in places like Dallas, Memphis, Orlando, New Orleans, etc...San Francisco? Hmmm, all of us healthy foodies would drive him outta town :-)"}
{"text":"OMG this place was SOOO MUCH FUN!! I think the only bad thing is that it close early.. it should be open 24 hours! The karaoke was funny to watch, the people getting spanked because they didnt finish their food was hilarious to watch! The way they present some of the things on the menu is super dope! Highly recommended, you just gotta see for yourself."}
{"text":"On our way to Sedona, my bf and I decided on making a stop by the Heart Attack Grill. We were intrigued by this restaurant since it was featured on the Foodnetwork and the Travel Channel. Also, we're not in AZ often so we decided to check it out.  The restaurant itself is located in a dying strip mall. The signage outside does not stand out at all so if you're not keeping an eye out for it you may miss it.  When you walk in the door, you're greeted by the smell of lard and cheerful waitresses dressed in nurses outfits. I was a little grossed out by lard smell but it was barely noticeable after a while. Haha.  My bf and I ordered a single bypass burger and fries. I didn't care to much for the fries. It was bland and soggy so I only had a few from the unlimited fries bar. The burger is delivered to you plainly as a cheeseburger and there's a condiment bar with pickles, jalapenos, onions, etc. LOVED the fresh pickles. It definitely made my burger eating experience more pleasurable. I was 2/3 done with my burger when my bf tells me to not watch the video playing on the screen which shows the cooking process of the burger. What do most people do when you hear something like that? You check it out due to curiosity, right? I wish I hadn't seen it because I completely lost my appetite upon seeing the video. *shudder* I sort of knew and remembered the cooking process from the foodnetwork or travel channel shows but seeing it and actually eating it grossed me out.   I'm glad I tried it but I doubt I'd be coming back again if I'm in the Arizona area. I value my arteries a little too much to subject it to such grease/lard again."}
{"text":"It is just a fun Vegas experience!  Just realize it is cash only!  It lives up to its name.  It was probablly horrendous for us...but it was fun.  Order the smallest things, it will still be too much!"}
{"text":"The Heart Attack Grill is definitely one of the gems of the valley. For all of the negative reviews about the food being greasy and bad for you, I'm not sure what you were expecting. They are exactly what they advertise - a deliciously quick trip to the grave. The burgers are dripping with lard, making them tantilizingly juicy. Of course this is not the place for someone looking for a light, healthy lunch, but for those of us who enjoy indulging in what might be our last meal, a double bypass burger is a worthy choice.   Personally i love the gimmick of the naughty nurses (who i may add are more than willing to sit on your lap while you sweat through a burger and fries) and Dr. Jon.  The Heart Attack Grill is well deserving of their recent fame. Ignore the whiners and try it out!"}
{"text":"Cool experience and fun environment. Really not for children due to what's displayed on their TV's.   I would come here again and I would definitely recommend it.   Good luck"}
{"text":"The hubs and I had a great time here! We are Vegas locals, but this was our first time visiting Heart Attack Grill. Service was pretty speedy considering the number of guests there on Saturday. We took the advice of fellow yelpers and split a single bypass with bacon  and a side of onion rings. We also ordered one of the frozen dreamsicle drinks with a side of Vodka...The drink was disgusting! I am not exaggerating when I say it tasted like crushed ice with syrup mixed into it, YUCK! The rest of the food was fine  . I usually prefer my burger cooked medium, but it was still quite tasty well-done. My husband enjoyed his half of the burger, and we both agreed the onion rings were awesome...crunchy and served with a side of ranch. We were unable to finish the onion rings, but since we finished our burger we did not have to be paddled by our nurse in front of the entire restaurant. Many other diners were not so lucky. We witnessed several patrons receiving harsh paddling due to their failure to finish their meals. It was great, and we made sure to take several pictures of the paddlings as well as the rest of the experience. If you are visiting Las Vegas, I recommend giving this place a try; the food is certainly not the best we have had, but the experience was priceless! FYI, everyone must wear a hospital gown during the meal, so be prepared."}
{"text":"Great entertainment, horrible food! Btw, I had the Double Bypass Burger with about 10pcs of bacon. The bacon was the best part of the burger!"}
{"text":"Food is awful. Very disappointing because this place has such potential, but the awkward presentation and bland food makes this a place to avoid."}
{"text":"This place is kinda crazy! They make you wear a hospital patient gown before you are seated to dine there. They are not shy when they list the food items as being loaded w fat, calories, and artery logging ingredients! I like how they have a full bar as well as 20oz. cans of select beers on hand too! The posters on the walls tell it all. If you don't finish your burger you WILL get spanked on your bottom with a paddle by several of the waitresses there. Not that that's a bad thing!  :D"}
{"text":"I went here twice during my weekend in Vegas.  Once by myself, just to see what everyone that I know was talking about.  The second time was to bring one of my co-workers that I was in Vegas with.  Yes, it's a gimmick.  Get over that.  You walk in, they put a wrist band and hospital gown onto you.  You then have four burger options....single, double, triple, or quadruple bypass.   Each patty is a half pound, so you do the math.  The only thing that comes on it is tomato, onion and cheese.  Bacon is extra, but over-loaded for a small upcharge.  Mayonnaise is served in squeeze bottles tableside.  Both times I had a superlative experience.  On my first trip, I ordered a Coors Light from the bartender.  She stared at me until I realized my mistake, then I got a PBR.  I figured what the hell, it's not like I'm going for quality here.  The PBR was covered in ice and was super cold, which went perfect with the great burger I got.  I found their burgers to be quite good, on both visits.  The fries are not my style, but are fried up in lard.  IT'S A GIMMICK, DEAL WITH IT.  I spoke freely with the super-friendly wait staff, both the owner who was in a doctor's coat and the bartender in the nurse's outfit.  This was about the time that the \"doctor\" chastised the bartender for both of us not having a cold beer in our hands.  Beers were provided to both of us then, one that was not on my tab.  After that, when I went to pay (CASH ONLY), the bartender pushed my money away, said, \"We're not done with you yet.\"   She then produced two massive glasses filled with Jaeger.  Say what you will about whether you like licorice booze or not, but you can't turn it away when it's sitting in front of you.   I downed the shot with the bartender, and then commented that they don't skimp on the booze.  She pointed out that it was a 4oz shot that she pours, the only kind they do.  I also didn't pay for that shot.  This place is all about hedonism, fun, non-pretentiousness, and just going for it.  And they look to reward you for being in on it.  If you go here, wanting a foodie dining experience, you're looking for reasons to be pissed.  Accept it for what it is, and love the hell out of it.  I plan to visit again the next time I'm in Vegas.  Absolutely."}
{"text":"You must go as it's fun and different! I'm giving them 4 stars because when I went there the first time it was an awesome experience hahaha thay treat you as a patient and if you don't finish your meal, they will spank you. They had good looking staff and it was kind of kinky haha. The food was OK. But this year  Food wasn't as good as I remembered and was greasier. I already knew about the spank thing and the girls would spank your date if you dot finish your meal as a girl!  They also were not as pretty as last time."}
{"text":"Looked cool on tv.  Tasted like nothing to brag about.   Yes the medical theme is cool, the girls are basically hooters girls in nurse outfits. You wear a hospital gown and there's cool decor and eye candy. People get spanked   Your wallet is also getting spanked. $13 for a single burger, fries, and coke? And I missed what was so awesome about it. They don't put pickles or lettuce on the burgers, they're pretty plain. I thought the bun would be sinfully delicious, nope!! Nothing special there.  And the fries were nothing special, I really don't get what the appeal of the actual food is. Five Guys is way better, even Wendy's is better.  Our server was not that great. Waited 20 minutes to get our check and the place wasn't even crowded on a Saturday at 230pm.  Skip it and grab a 99 cent fried Twinkie down the street."}
{"text":"This was the highlight of my trip to Las Vegas and I would recommend it to anyone.  I love the theme and how fun it is there. A restaurant that can thoroughly stick to there theme is a wonderful place to go.  They dress you up in hospital gowns, the food is directed towards the theme as well as the alcohol.  The waitresses at this restaurant love there job you can tell.I had an AMAZING waitress named Rianna who I would recommend to anyone who is going to talk to her. She was so down to earth and wonderful.  They do Karaoke there as well which isn't the main attraction and just kind of added but it is okay. I also don't know how I feel about congratulating people who are over 350 pounds with a free meal but it was cool seeing people get weighed and the scale.  I didn't eat but all they have is burgers and fries. Instead I decided to stick to drinks. I love that the Jello shots are in an actual syringe and are huge! I love that the only option you can get is red for the blood. My Mom got wine and the only option is to get a bottle of wine in an IV bag so that is what she got!  Be careful about what burger you order because if you don't finish your food... you get spanked :)"}
{"text":"This place was simply OK and nothing more.  I'd say try it once for the experience of being able to say you did it but I wouldn't recommend going back.  First let me say this place is no where near the strip and you have to take a taxi to get to it if you're staying in a hotel on the strip.  And you can honestly get a much better tasting burger at a nicer restaurant on the strip for the exact same price.  It's a big place that looks like someone took a high school cafeteria and tried to dress it up.  The concept is cool but it could be done up a lot better.  Lots of little improvements here and there could change the whole experience.  The food tasted okay and I swear I've had better at a Wendy's drive through.  The fries I couldn't even finish and I was hoping it would be something that would pop in my mouth and scream AMAZING, but it was more of a yawn.  I can't even finish this review, this place was barely worth my time on writing this review."}
{"text":"Don't go here. The food is horrible.  Stay away there are better places. I was disapointed in this place. They talk a good game, food sucks. Burgers were very very dry and no flavor, they didnt tast fresh almost like they were microwaved and the bread was hard as a rock.. The frys must have been cooked in motor oil cause they were very dark and nasty looking, they didnt look anything like the picture at all. Now I understand they want you to order a drink and not order a water. I orderd a coke and a water and the waitress says they dont serve water, just stupid cause I orderd a coke also. AGAIN STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"Atmosphere awesome our waitress was really attentive.  The spankings there when you don't finish your burger are brutal we saw a paddle get broke on one man.  The food is horrible greasy burgers and no flavor I actually ended up getting sick afterwards. Would not be a place we go back to."}
{"text":"All sizzle, no steak. So, the gimmick is that you're in a hospital and they force gowns on you before you are seated. Their very limited menu consists of half-pound burger patties (you can order up to eight on a bun), fries cooked in lard and bottled sodas. The food is memorable, but not in a good way. I don't know if it was the method of cooking but this was the worst burger I've ever consumed in my four decades of my life. The texture was mealy and the taste reminded me of a spoiled turkey burger. Not to mention pricy. The fries were inexpensive but weren't much better.  It should be pointed out that if you weigh over 350 pounds you eat for free. Also, people who do not finish their meal get an optional paddling in full view of patrons.  The gimmick is neat but I cannot recommend the food here. Try it for the experience and nothing more."}
{"text":"So fattening. SO unhealthy. SO DELICIOUS! It was worth the drive from LA to AZ."}
{"text":"Main bullet point - Really, really bad burgers. I ordered a double bypass burger and found it so off-putting and bland I couldn't eat much of  it.  I decided to take a bite of each ingredient separately to see what the problem was.   The patty seemed like a very low grade \"soy-burger\" type thing that had close to no flavor what-so-ever.   Even the bacon didn't taste very baconey [sic]. The cheese tasted like I was biting into a glob of pure lard with a tiny bit of cheese flavoring added, it was really disgusting.  The fries were almost as bad as the burger.  The only thing I had that was good was the chocolate shake. It was unusual in that it had a buttery flavor. That might not sound good, but it is. If you must come here definitely get the shake.  This place is all theme and gimmick. If you want to experience it in the best way, stay outside and look through the window and watch the spankings and goofiness for a few minutes. It's not worth going in."}
{"text":"I understand the gimmick of this restaurant and also know to factor that into thinking about the experience and the food I'm going to have or had. The \"waitnurses,\" as I'd like to coin this term, are very friendly, save the one I accidentally caught scratching the middle pocket of her apron around the area near what some would call \"wonderland.\" Oh, of course she happened to be the one to serve us.   My brother, my love and I went in, were draped in their clean bib-acting robes. As we passed by a wheelchair for an obese person, I wondered to myself if anybody actually sat in that chair before and fit the chair. I was expecting a fun evening, especially for my brother, who just turned 21 and was in town for New Year's weekend.   Previously, I had stopped by once before to get their chocolate shake. The hostess ordered it for me, and curiosity got the best of me, so I had to ask how many calories the chocolate shake was. I was thinking maybe 1000 would be a little bit close to my expectation of unhealthy, but it was double that amount! 2000 whopping calories for what Ryan H. described as an East Coast frozen custard - I took it to go and shared it with my love and together,we were both able to have half of it. We couldn't do the rest. They advertise that it's pure creme. I don't mind killing myself for good food, but I would say this was a tad bit better than mediocre.   To the dinner... we had the  Triple Bypass: our waitnurse (the one who scratched her area) wouldn't let us split at first, and we told her that we had already eaten and were just passing by and wanted to try them, so she allowed us to split it ourselves. Grilled onions must have been on the sideline of the grill for a while, because they sure were out of practice and didn't do their part. They were lukewarm and had no flavor, not even anything savory. The bacon somewhat tried to attack us, but they needed more of a defense because again they were benching players. Bacon strips were also lukewarm. The meat was not a seasoned player, didn't know how to attack us and the sliced tomatoes were not signed on this season, so they were a no-go either. The only thing that attacked us horribly were the calories. The Quadruple Bypass is 8000 calories according to our waitnurse, and we had the Triple, so minus maybe 1500 calories brings us to about 6500 calories split between the three of us. Well, I didn't do bread, so it's a little more for the guys.   We also ordered 3 Cokes and the  Vanilla Shake: this was yummier than the chocolate shake, but it definitely did taste like butter, but not like a butter popcorn jelly belly as someone else mentioned in their review. I would like to add that for the amount of calories it had, it should taste great, but it wasn't really up to par with its 2000 average daily value calories. My brother really enjoyed the shake. I enjoyed it also, but perhaps because the burger was so disappointing. Le sigh...  As we were waiting for our fries to get to us, we saw a doctor-costumed bartender dancing with a waitnurse who was kind of DJing and counting the minutes to New Year's. They were having fun dancing, and yes, there were dim TVs if you were sitting right next to them, but if you were far enough away, you were able to see music videos from the 80's paired next to videos of a doctor using his stethoscope to pat the burger meat down onto the grill.   Lard-fried Fries: I had a total of about three fries from the basket of fries. No, I'm not obsessively counting calories and at this point it wouldn't even matter. However, I was very disappointed that the texture of the fries weren't identifiable. I could say what it wasn't. It wasn't crispy. It wasn't freshly soggy like In N' Out. It wasn't delicious or had a certain taste to it. It was the most apathetic basket of fries I had ever met. \"Hello, Fries. Okay. I see. Goodbye. You don't care? Okay.\"   Our waitnurse brought us the bill. Throughout the entire dinner, we figured out where she had her hand on our plates and the bill, so we weren't nervous about her being our waitress, not at all. I'd like to add to her benefit of the doubt, that all the waitnurses are made to wear red bras and undershorts that are possibly uncomfortable.   I asked my brother if he had fun. He enjoyed the experience, but he didn't like the food. I am a good food hunter. I feel I disappointed my brother and should have listened to the few and the wise on Yelp, but wanted to try it for myself, hoping to regain a few stars of hope for this new and grotesquely interesting place. Hope? Nope. I wish the Denny's had opened there instead. Sorry, Dr. Jon. Nutritionist gone wild? Well, this is ¡¡¡¡Mad Food Yelper gone fariggin' LOCA!!!! Okay. Time of death...2:41am"}
{"text":"How does this place stay in business? Last year I attempted to eat here and the staff was rude and clearly unhappy. It took 15 minutes after I started paying attention to my watch, in a nearly empty restaurant, in the early afternoon, to get service. We were already standing up to leave when we were approached. They could have cared less and actually got smart as we walked out. Walking out we saw people seated after us had drinks already. Quite interesting.... Just this Saturday night I was with a group who wanted to eat there. I protested but agreed to go. Apparently they were only taking to go orders? On a Saturday night? I give up. Reading these reviews it doesn't seem much like it's worth it any longer."}
{"text":"I like my fat and calorie indulgences to feel authentic. I love pasta made with butter and cream, I love things fried in bacon and duck fat.   This place had all of the guilt for me and none of the pleasure.   The waitresses were hot in a Vegas Stripper sort of way and I get the gimmick, being given a hospital gown.    After the first joke though, it wore old. I wanted a water.  They don't serve it.  I don't really like sugary soda.  I should have seen if they had coffee. They do not take card, just cash.  They give out free food if you are over 350 lbs.  After awhile it felt less and less authentic until it felt like some cheap mockery of a diner experience where the joke was on me.   The meat is good. Have to say my cousin and I split one burger between us. I barely could eat a quarter of their smallest burger. The shakes are super rich but seriously - the butter on top made me loose my appetite for it.   Fries should be fried in something that has a taste - not lard. Lard is useless for cooking, it's not nearly as tasty as bacon fat or duck grease or  any number of oils out there.   I wouldn't go back. I would save my calories for something else."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely horrible. The burgers are absolutely disgusting.. The patty was extremely dry.. the onions tasted old, like a sweaty gym sock, the cheese was flavorless. Wolfs can chili tastes better than their chili.. The worst burgers in the world. McDonald's makes better burgers than this place.  Still can't get that nasty taste out of my mouth.. Normally I'm not picky but this restaurant here.. Is Just damn right disgusting. I'd rather run into oncoming traffic before returning to this POS restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to this place because I saw it on DDD. When you walk in the whole gimmick is explained to you so no surprises \" You have a choice of a spanking or sing karaoke if you don't finish your burger, cash only, you may split only the single burger, you will wear a hospital gown and be served by \"nurses\". (And I am a nurse) There really were no surprises. The food was ok, the largest burger is 8 patties, 8 pieces cheese, and I think 42pc bacon for 20,000 calories! If you weigh over 350lb you eat free. I decided karaoke or spankings aren't for me so mom and I shared a single burger (it was ok) onion rings (delicious and too many to finish) and a chocolate shake (made with butter)! We didn't drink/eat much of the shake as the texture was lumpy and weird. I was told I'd get a free jello shot since my hands fit in the hand print but never received it. Wine is served in IV drips. I watched several people get spanked (usually 3 spankings that get harder each time- followed by a hug) I am here to tell you I felt those spankings just by being at the table next to the spanking contraption! They were HARD! WOW! So glad I shared my single burger (which was plenty).Fun place for a one time gimmick."}
{"text":"Heart Attack grill is a must if your visiting Vegas. The portions are Huge, Tasty, and seriously Unhealthy!. I had the triple bypass and was amazing, couldn't finish it all so I had to get spanked by our lovely nurse. Highly recommend checking into this Hospital eatery."}
{"text":"Big burgers, lots of bacon. Fun place. Wine in an I.V. Bag and a good spanking from your waitress of you don't finish your burger."}
{"text":"So many haters, but really this place is kinda awesome. In a city full of sin, how can you settle for anything less. Total dudes' place much akin to Hooters. I admire the great risk that the owner took to bring it here, but of course well...I'm a self proclaimed fatass. I didn't have problems with the extra extra friendly (spanking) service. This place is damn unique.  -=-Quadruple Bypass Champ-=- Yep you heard it. I downed the 8000 calories in one sitting. Sure, the 270 mile ride home wasn't fun, but you gotta pay to play. Most might say so much quantity that it can't possibly taste good, but let me tell you....the tastiness of the patty is really what got me through this. It's no frills cooked to tenderness perfection, with a slathering of cheese melted on. No charcoal mess, no gimmicks, just good ol' food. My technique was to divide and conquer where I essentially made 2 doubles. When I knocked down that tower of meat, the sense of accomplishment was monumental. I looked over at my partners' burgers and juices were just spilling down, but my plate, no messy droppings. All technique! At the end of the meal, I was wheeled out to my car in a hospital robe by my buxom nurse server. I was King of the World this day. King of the Toilet that night."}
{"text":"Upon entering we were greeted by a nurse and doctor who we realized was the owner. We were offered hospital gowns as everyone is required to wear them while visiting. The decor was cool, the owner was in most of the custom pictures. One was of a cartoon mural with about 10 of the old school fast food icons: Ronald McDonald, Wendy, Dominos Pizza Guy, Jack In The Box, etc.... There was a lot of thought put into the decor. Theres a huge scale inside & out so you can weigh yourself. Anyone 350 pounds or more eat free. All the females are dressed as nurses & males as doctors. 2 big screen tv's which were playing re-runs of news reels from stories of the grill, a guy being gurnied out by medics due to an actual heart attack, etc.  The menu is extemely simple: A single, double, triple, quadruple bypass burger-all with bacon. The single has 5 pieces of bacon, double has 10 pieces, triple 15, and quad 20!! Beef is 1/2 pound to 2 lbs with all the fixings: cheese, onion & tomatoe. French fries that are fresh cut & deep fried in pure Lard, mmmmmmm!! Either a chocolate or Vanilla milkshake made with ButterFat. A bottled water or CocaCola in a bottle. No other sodas and they dont have ice.  CASH ONLY! They also sell Lucky Strike Cigarettes in a vending machine by the carton.  The food was nothing spectacular, Ive definitely had better. But the experience was fun & different. A nurse went to a table and spanked a customer with a paddle for being a bad boy & not finishing his food. (A couple at the next table who hadnt ordered yet got up and left after seeing that happen), I thought it was funny but maybe its not for everyone. I would go back again for the experience."}
{"text":"Well I had to come check this place out after seeing it on TV before I moved to LV. Well I finally came here and boy was I let down. I had the hotdog and butter chocolate shake. The hotdog even though packing an absurd amount of calories was just super salty but bland tasting. The shake however was pretty good if you can get past the big tab of butter floating in your shake! My wife had the double by pass burger and fries and she said that she prefer 5 guys over it and the fries again was kinda marginal not not delivering on taste even with the gargantuan amount of calories it enstowed. The reason I give two stars is because it was kinda fun watching patrons of the resturant  getting paddled by the waitress and watching the reactions of the customers. Wearing the hospital gown is not optional btw so be prepared to donn one! Enjoy."}
{"text":"Buck for Buck, spank for spank, best $ spent for bountiful burgers, fries and shakes around. Made the mistake of ordering a triple, luckily I hadn't eaten all day and was barely able to finish the tasty morsel. Fries just took up too much valuable stomach space. The shake was perfectly creamy with more than enough chocolate flavor to help dinner slide down the pie hole. More than completely satisfied! Didn't need to eat again for weeks.....my cardiologist didn't approve!  Wait staff was courteous and relatively prompt even with the restaurant about 80% full.  The whole concept is wickedly anti-diet, in your face 'tongue in cheek' cliche - puns intended! The three tables around us diners all joined in the fun.  If there is a book-\"How to have fun in Vegas on the Cheap\" most definitely will feature this place."}
{"text":"Lola was The Best. She was upbeat, kept dancing, and thorough in explaining how the place works. We ordered and the burgers were way better than we expected. The soda were a bit too sweet but the food and atmosphere is amazing. Laughed the whole time."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. They require you to wear the stupid hospital gown. The interior of the restaurant looks like they ran out of money 20% into the buildout. The TVs play disgusting images of fat bare bellies bouncing and getting slapped. If that isn't enough to lose your appetite, I don't know what is. They take the fun theme too far.   BTW, take a look of the pictures on their menus of the food. It looks disgusting!  Gross."}
{"text":"This place had a really cool theme and it seemed like it would be good... 1. The robes you wear have a weird smell, was really uncomfortable wearing it  2. The food is shit! OMG the food was disgusting!!! The meat looked pale and days old, as if it was preheated and then tossed into heating pans to keep warm all day. The chili was drenched in lard/oil. Out of a group of 8, 2 threw up after at the suit and 2 had bad stomach aches and 2 had diarrhea...we all agreed the food was crap and would never return again.  3. ...apparently they don't have an A/C because I could smell the sweat in the air.   Conclusion: go for the experience if it's a must but honestly it's a waste of money, time, and health. They don't call of the heart attack grill for nothing."}
{"text":"Very unique experience I must say.  I came with some buddies on 08/09/2015.  I was expecting a hospital environment was was really surprised at the all the 'merica satire and the embrace of all things fating. Some find it uncomfortable, but as long as you tell yourself this isn't serious, you'll have a good time. The burgers weren't that good, but its the atmosphere that really brings people here. Once in a lifetime experience is good enough for me."}
{"text":"Well we've always wanted to try the Heart Attack Grill and got the opportunity while we were in Vegas this past weekend.  As soon as you walk in you are fitted with a hospital gown and you wear that during your whole meal.  The nurses are dressed in sexy outfits and you are promised a spanking if you don't finish your burger.  We both got the single bypass burger which I finished but my husband didn't!  Yep he got a spanking.   We shared an order of fries and we shared a chocolate shake which is a \"butterfat\" shake, very chocolatey and probably one of the best shakes I've ever had.  Garnished with a pat of butter.  I attempted to get a Diet Coke and I was told there isn't anything Diet.  There is no lettuce with the burgers.   I found the burgers and fries to be average and the chocolate shake was outstanding.  You pay for the atmosphere.  Cash only.   If you are over 350 lbs you eat free.  Overall a fun place to go !"}
{"text":"Food isn't all that great. Meat doesn't taste like good quality. I give 3 stars because it was a great experience. Super funny in there, live the waitresses energy. Great for a 1 time experience."}
{"text":"The hamburgers were awful and that's coming from someone who LOVES fattening foods. The burgers were warm at best, the service wasn't great either. Maybe because we ate at 9:30pm on a Saturday night? The place was empty (should have been a sign) with NO atmosphere and we ended up getting out of our seats to ask for a knife and later the check. I took two kids here thinking it would be a fun place. . . NOT. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Once you get past the gimmick the food is actually enjoyable.  The fare is simple and well executed. The burgers and hotdog were of above average quality if not gourmet (who would expect gourmet here?).  The shakes were excellent.  Service was on point.  Be advised they only accept cash here. I had cash on me but not everybody walks with cash these days."}
{"text":"I will like to start to say the experience is one of a kind. Fun place to visit at least one time. Staff are passionate to deliver service that is entertaining and out of the norm. I expected too much to have a great burger. I was not very satisfied. I had a good time, but the spanking part when meals are not completely consume, does not make me to excited to come back. Also the spanking with the paddle was no joke, my butt was numb for couple hours."}
{"text":"This was something I'd had on my bucket list for years, so I may have had unrealistic expectations going into it. But.. The food was okay. The theme is awesome and atmosphere can't be beat. I had such higher expectations for the food though.   I ordered a single burger with fries. The burger was bland with too much bun. The fries didn't seem to have my flavor at all.   But again, the experience, theme and cost make this a must see.   Only big warning, they don't take credit cards to plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Total disappointment. Shame on Food Network for even airing them a few years ago when I first learned of it. You would think that the food was good if they were on the Food Network, right? Hell naw. False advertisement.  Yeah this place prides itself on being bad and YOLO and what not. They have the strongest daiquiri, cigarette candy, animal-fat fries, etc. Yeah, I don't mind indulging on those things in moderation but when I do, it better be damn good. The burger was so bland, I asked for a side of pickles to help slither that overcooked mess down my throat but the owner doesn't like pickles so he does not offer it in his restaurant. Pffft!  The only thing this place has going for them is it's gimmicky, touristy and tacky. I highly doubt they have any repeat customers besides the morbidly obese that get to eat for free. But then again those guys have been dropping like flies up in there."}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant on TV and said I must go there whenever I go to Las Vegas and it was pretty much what I expected. First thing you should know is that they only take cash so prepare for that. You can use there ATM but like all ATMs in Vegas they charge you like $7 to take money out. Second thing is you should finish your burger if you don't want a spanking. They told me after I ordered mine and after seeing them hit some guy I was determined not to be him. I also seen a guy get a spanking for not ordering alcohol so drink up. It's a fun place to go honestly. It seems to appeal to masochistic individuals for an example there's a picture above the urinal in the men's bathroom with two woman laughing talking about how small my Johnson was lol. The food was good but I've definitely had a better burger. You mostly go here for the experience and not because the food is amazing."}
{"text":"The onion rings and chocolate shake was incredible!!! The environment alone is unbelievably incredible."}
{"text":"Awsome food! If you're looking for fancy, dainty, or any adjective other than basic - forget it.  Real back to fundamentals food!  Burger - beef, fried, nothing else. (with cheese is default) No special sauce or secret seasonings, just real meat. They do have a \"garnish\" bar - but don't look for the lettuce.  Fries - potatoes, fresh cut before your eyes, then fried - in lard.  Coke - cold, in a glass bottle, made with real sugar.  Enjoy your burger, fries, and a Coke unadulterated!"}
{"text":"Worst burger I have ever tried!!! I am still to this day grossed out by the thought of their greasy burgers and stale buns. The French fries were just ok and the theme was pretty funny but definitely just an overall weird experience. Our waitress was nice but wasn't very accommodating; just took our order and then brought us the check. I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone, despite the unique theme."}
{"text":"I just hadddddd to go... Smh... Why why why... The atmosphere is fun with the \" nurses\" but in the end focus back on that lard filled menu. It is only because I am not in a frat house nor am i no longer in my 20s and have actually been here once now that will keep me away. Keep it to the tourist, they will have fun as it is a ...in my opinion  a once visited place only..."}
{"text":"I'm gonna have to chime in here since I actually enjoy the food here. The place, for the most part, is still pretty new... and I had no problems with the service here. The novelty of the place is funny, and it is what it is. Gimmick with the hospital gown, nurses as the waitresses, and even a doctor wandering about.  Though.. there are some words of warning... they serve unhealthy food... THAT'S THE POINT... nothing is healthy here... so why would they serve diet soda? Yea.. they have water now because restaurants are always required to serve it.. but you have to buy a bottle ($2).. ok.. it sucks.. it's just a regular 16.9 oz bottle of water you can get a big case of 24 for like $5 at a grocery store.. (so $2 is a major ripoff..)  So, if you want water.. I'd say just bring in a bottle of your own (not sure if they'd let you, but shoot... I'd sneak in one for whatever.).. Just be prepared ahead of time.  ... and it's CASH ONLY. another downer and something you need to be prepared for.. The atm there charges $0.75 and at least for me.. isn't that bad... though it's best if you remember to bring in cash in the first place.  I love bacon. It's a wonderful thing... so when I found out they had tons of it in their burger.. as well as the fries being fried in lard... HELL YEAH I was excited. If people are grossed out about that... sorry.. you can go elsewhere. And the butter fat shakes.. again.. it's unhealthy.. of course it's on the menu...  so again.. if you're grossed out by it... don't order it.. DUH... and btw, i had one made with chocolate.. it was DELICIOUS... you wanna call it gross? fine.. go eat some broccoli with some non-fat ranch dressing.  BTW, I went yesterday evening and enjoyed the food enough to come back again tonight. Is it wrong to promote obesity by giving people free food if they weigh over 350 lbs? I actually find that disturbing... but hey.. the food here is good.. and I won't argue about that."}
{"text":"Bomb ass place, service was real quick, and having Double bi-pass burger top off with feeling ghetto drink of Old english 24oz...and didn't get spanked..aww bummer, smh...Olskool"}
{"text":"It was alright; people make it seem that it's a big deal but it's really not. I got the single burger w/ bacon & fries, & it was DELICIOUS. I love bacon! ;) I also ordered the butterfat? shake & it was surprisingly good."}
{"text":"For some odd reason I really liked this place. It kind of remind of Dick's Last Resort. The food is OK, but the service is pretty good and it is like you get a show while you eat.  You start off by putting on a surgery gown. Then you place your order.  They tell you that if you do not eat all of your food, you will get paddled.  We all know that is however optional. I did not eat all my food and left unscathed.  Other tables around me were having a great time. If you are over a certain weight, I believe 300, you eat free.  That means you get one burger at a time, but have to purchase a drink. So, for me the novelty, and spectacle bumped this place up. I hope I am able to make it there again.  Note: Here, wine comes in a IV bag and they play super cheesy videos on the restaurant's TV"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Got the single burger, it was good. Fries and onions are delicious. Try to save room for them."}
{"text":"What a SH-- HOLE!!! And people say VEGANS spread PROPAGANDA??? HAHAHA RIGHT!! I don't think it gets any worse than advertising & promoting an unhealthy & OBESE lifestyle! Way to go, heart attack grill! You'll stop at nothing for profit, even if it means killing your customers slowly with cancer, diabetes & heart disease. (Aka MEAT & DAIRY.) For those who don't know - You actually get REWARDED for being obese & unhealthy at this so called \"restaurant\". What a JOKE."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during our Vegas vacation. This place has been featured on Travel Channel and Food Network. It's smack right at the entrance on Freemont St experience and the storefront features a giant size weight scale. It is definitely a tourist trap but also entertaining. Just the décor of the restaurant is worth checking out.  We were greeted by a hostess dressed up as a kinky nurse. She then escorted us to a walk-in closet where we grabbed the mandatory hospital gowns. I encourage everybody to take a group pic wearing the gowns because its priceless :)  FYI, this is a cash only place but the hostess will give you heads up anyway before you sit down. The menu is straightforward. You simply choose your burger starting from a single, double, triple, quadruple all the way up to 8 patties, if you dare. If you don't finish your entire meal including sides, you get spanked in front of public. It may seem embarrassing but public humiliation is what this place is really known for. The burgers however, were just ordinary. Too dry for my taste and I think they were frozen. Nevertheless, it was a blast hanging out here. Besides the public spanking, they also have karaoke. Anyone can request a song and perform on stage wearing the hospital gown while the crowd cheers on. Its definitely quite a spectacle!  Burgers start around $9 for a Single Bypass Burger and can go up to $24 for the Octuple. You can add bacon or other toppings for extra $$. Fries are also extra. They also have delicious real fatty milkshakes and liquor. Try one of the monster shots."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a good gimmick if your a tourist .. But u have to finish all your burger or you get paddled hard. The burger being big isn't the only hard part . The hardest part is the burger is gross and has no taste whatsoever so it makes the experience not so great. I would probably not go here again but it may give you a chuckle but feeling not so well after you finished your last bite."}
{"text":"Definitely the most unhealthy place to eat and they are proud of it.  Over 350 pounds and you eat for free.  Nurses are nice too.  The success here is built on their novelty, but with a little ingenuity it could be a real star attraction.  CASH ONLY!!!!"}
{"text":"Was visiting a brew house that is next door and wasn't feeling the food truck offereings.  Decided to come here and see what it was all about.  We figured it was a gimmicky place and would be \"ok\" at best.    Got placed into our hospital gowns and seated.  It was busy so wait was a little long but our \"nurse\" got us our drinks pretty quick.   We decided on food and ordered.  I opted for the 1/2 lb hot dog with chili and bacon.  It came out and looked amazing.  I managed to finish it because I didn't want my ass paddled  ( optional fun if you don't finish....having a hot nurse paddle ya).     So how was the food you ask?  It was damn good.  Chili was delish and the hot dog was beefy and flavorful.   We all thought...wow this place is legit.  The onion rings are damn good too.  Of you are on Fremont St in Vegas give this place a shot. Haha....I said shot."}
{"text":"I had seen this place on tv many times before and always wanted to try it.  If you are looking for an amazing time you should definitely stop here.  If you are looking for a great burger, there are many better places in Vegas.  The four star review is based almost entirely off of the atmosphere of this place.  They put you in a hospital gown when you walk in which sets the mood for a very fun experience.  All of the staff are very nice and friendly.  You can watch or participate in karaoke as you are waiting for your food.  If you don't finish your food you get paddled before exiting.  Overall just a great and fun place to be if you are looking for something different to do one night in Vegas.  The burger itself was slightly above average, but nothing special.  The meat tasted bland and was overcooked.  The bun was too thick and overpowered the taste of the meat.  In the end it turned out to be an ok greasy burger, but was forgettable.  The size of the burgers is definitely not forgettable and even a single patty is very big.  One person in our group made the mistake of ordering a triple which was the biggest burger I have ever seen.  It was a nice change of pace from the casino/club setting and I am happy we stopped.  I would probably go back again for how fun it is."}
{"text":"Ordered a quadruple bypass without fries at the bar, crushed it in five minutes and left. Felt miserable for the rest of the day, but an overall fun experience and a unique place."}
{"text":"No thanks!  I remember seeing this mythical place on Food Network. The idea of having a crazy huge, unhealthy burger sounded soooooo appealing. Also, it was close to home, so I figured WHY NOT!  We walked in expecting the place to be BAWMPIN'.   Unfortunately, it was lunch, and a weekday, so maybe it was our fault for picking a bad day.  The tables have full rolls of paper towels, and bottles of ketchup, mayo, and mustard. I got anxious looking at everybody else's orders, but I have to say that the setting made me a bit uncomfortable.  Firstly, I don't like the idea that I'm wearing a hospital gown that was probably worn by hundreds before me,(EVEN IF THEY WASH IT, ugh. I'm a germophobe, sorry) and to be worn on top of your clothes in the hot hot hot summer of Las Vegas... being sat in a sunny area of the restaurant... blahblahblah, I know I'm complaining, but it's what stood out to me.  Anyway, I'll make it short. The burger LOOKS amazing, but the taste... eh.  I got the double with bacon and fries. (I'm little but I can eat!)  I prefer my burgers medium, and theirs were well done, NO PINK! BOO! At first bite, I thought \"Hmm, this could be amazing\" but it was a little dry, so I added some ketchup. It was a bit better. Upon taking a few more bites, I started feeling like all I was eating was a dry, overcooked, hockey puck of beef, with no seasoning, no nada. Also, the fries... SOGGY and not very good! :( i was utterly disappointed.  BF and I also tried the shakes. Very good, but with a big, tasteless burger, and soggy fries, I wasn't impressed.  I think the shakes are the only thing I'd go back for.  PS. They only serve bottled water, no \"ice water\", so keep that in mind if you plan on eating here."}
{"text":"This place was a fun experience with watching those taking baseball swings at people's butts... to the different shot glasses they have.. and the wine Iv bag.... the food it self was okay but the part that was nasty was the chili. You can tell it is that cheap can chili not good at all. Maybe next time I go I'll get no chili on tge burger"}
{"text":"Heart Attack Grill is quite interesting in concept and can be a fun time. While waiting to zipline at Slotzilla, we went there for a drink. Fun times! Nurse Tracy is badass. She's funny awesome and can give u good tips for your trip. I had the syringe shot which was extremely strong. Wanted to try the IV wine bag but time wasn't on our side and I was too full. It's a very touristy kind of spot but hey! I'm a tourist! If you choose to order food, make sure you clean the plate...Or you're subject to a spanking!"}
{"text":"Ate here on our last day in Vegas. Food tasted good, our waitress was really friendly and portions are designed to make sure you get paddled for not finishing your meal. This place is worth the stop in to try out."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to eat food is good not healthy burgers cooked in lard I got the triple bypas and had to force myself to finish it so much food but  still a fun experience in Vegas the waitress / nurse was very friendly she helped my son relax after he thought he was booing to get spanked for not  finishing his food only real negative was it is a cash only restaurant and no local ATMs that didn't  shady"}
{"text":"I went here with my husband and 2 friends. One of my friends really wanted to come here cause he is over 350 lbs.   You get gowned up in a beautiful hospital gown before you are sat. We sat by the window and it was kinda annoying cause people are gawking in the whole time taking pictures for their instagram.   We had the gorgeous  Lola as our waitress and I loved her, she was a delight. I ordered the single with fries. Our friend who ate for free started with a single. If you are over 350 and want to eat for free, you have to order a drink at least. You also have to get on the scale in the middle of the room so everyone can see your weight.   The food came out super fast. I wasn't expecting much out of these burgers and that is exactly what I got. Just generic burgers, nothing special about them. They only have soda in bottles so no free refills. The fries were like bad McD's.   My husband didnt finish his double so he got spanked by Lola. Overall food bad, service good. It is a one time thing I think. I would never go back."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have delicious burgers, hot dogs, french fries and milkshakes as well as beer and booze. I ate a quadruple bypass burger, a coronary dog, 2 vanilla shakes, a beer and a shot of Jameson. It was all excellent. As if all that was not enough, they also have some very hot, sexy nurses to wait on you. What more could a guy want?!!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place on the news and so I wanted to give it a try and see if it was \"taste worth dying for\" as they claim. Unfortunately, it's really not. The burger and fries I got were decent, but not anything special. And service was not that good.  I just ordered a single bypass burger and it was moist, but not juicy. And the fries were brown and really needed salt to taste good. They were rather flimsy and really nothing special, even if they are in fact cooked in lard.  As for service, it wasn't the worst, but it could've been better. The hostess at the front really looked miserable and like she didn't want to be there. The \"nurse\" who served me at my table was okay, but after she took my order I waited around 20 minutes for a burger and fries! Other people who had been in there before me were waiting as well, and then finally everybody's food all came out at the same time. The nurse did check on me once, but otherwise she was just mingling with the others as well as the \"doctor\" throughout the night. The place was rather empty, too!  What makes this place interesting aside from the obvious hospital theme is the fact that they show music videos of some classic old hits on the big screen. I also thought it was cute how on the receipt, the restaurant was referred to as a \"diet center\" and the tax was called \"Obama's cut.\"  I was hoping to be blown away when I decided to try this place that warns people that it's bad for your health. Unfortunately, I found that I can get a better burger elsewhere and similar fries without the artery clogging, or upset stomach that I felt a bit later on that evening. In short, not worth the hype or price."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Las Vegas, and saw the Heart Attack Grill on Freemont Street, I went in and while I thought it was really cool that the staff were all dressed as medical personnel, and they gave the customers hospital gowns upon entry I found the food to be mediocre and overpriced.   I ordered their smallest burger with cheese and tomato, french fries and a vanilla milkshake. The burger was overcooked, and when I asked for medium well, I was told that they only do well done. The fries were super greasy and soggy and the Vanilla Milkshake was actually garnished with butter. I asked why that was and was told that it was a \"Butterfat\" shake. It had an odd buttery taste to it so 85% of that got wasted.  Despite a cool atmosphere, and limited menu, I will not be returning. Although I have to say that everything BUT the food was super cool."}
{"text":"Das Restaurant war genauso wie im TV. Der Burger und die Fries waren mittelmäßig. Die Schläge auf den Po haben gar nicht so wehgetan."}
{"text":"This place was awful. The food was disgusting and it tasted horrible. The service was atrocious. I don't know who owns this place but they should burn it down. If I could put less than one star, I would. Negative 50 stars"}
{"text":"Hospital Gowns. Jello shots in a syringe.  Food themed movie posters.  Delicious burgers.  People getting paddled.  What more could you ask for in crazy Las Vegas?  It might not be the kind of place you go for a serious meal or even a healthy one--the vegetarian menu is unfiltered cigarettes--but it is a fun experience.  If you are in a hurry, this might not be the place for you but if you have time--1-2 hours--it is worth the experience.  Caution: don't let the red head paddle you.  She has a fierce wind-up and a hell of a swing!!"}
{"text":"Once you arrive you will have put on a hospital gown it is NOT optional even if your aren't eating.   The burger was just okay they were a little dry for my liking and there were not many toppings to choose from.   The drinks are a great value you get about 3 premium shots like (patron, kettle one etc.) for under $20."}
{"text":"This is the ONLY Restaurant I know that is known Around the World for their unique brand messaging.    I ate at one of their original locations in Phoenix/Tuscon area.     Very Very Tasty Food all cooked in lard.   You should visit AT least once.  Customer is pampered like no other place Ive been to."}
{"text":"I came here since it was on many of those \"must do in downtown Vegas\" lists.   The one star is for the fact that service was nice and friendly.  There are so many cons. The decor is tacky and distasteful. The spankings just seemed sad and fun only for those who were drunk and wildly awkward for everyone else. The prices are unreasonable.   For a place that claims to be a \"taste worth dying for,\" shouldn't the burger actually taste at least mediocre? The burger was overwhelmed by the chili, which is good but salty. The fries are crispy but flavorless otherwise. The milkshakes are thick and come with a slat of butter, but the only noticeable difference is that it's very smooth but feels like you're sipping room temperature butter with flavoring.  Frying something in lard doesn't automatically make it taste good. Honestly, it feels like a waste of calories and money coming here--Red Robin, Shake Shack, etc all have better food and prices."}
{"text":"If you have ventured off of the Las Vegas strip to Fremont and have come into the Heart Attack Grill, you are clearly there for one reason:  a big, greasy burger.  This is not a gourmet burger place.  There is no creativity or flair added.  It is simply a big, greasy burger, cooked in pure lard, and covered in more bacon than you'd like to eat for breakfast after, well, a night in Vegas.  The menu gets right to the point.  I think there are maybe 6 options, not including drinks.  Everything will be greasy and cooked in fat.  I opted for the \"single bypass\" burger, which was 1/2 pound of beef, 5 strips of bacon, american slice cheese, and onions.  That's it folks.  The burger nearly slipped out of my hands it was so greasy.  Was it tasty?  Of course.  It was juicy and satisfying, but only in a way that will make you feel like poop for hours after eating there.  (and poop you will!)  It honestly wasn't anything special.  I weighed myself on the way in and out, and between the burger and PBR I gained 2 lbs.  I guess this is kind of the point of eating there, really.  After all...you put on hospital gowns when you're seated.  I saw a lot of people trying to eat the triple or even quadruple bipass burger.  Most people looked like they wanted to die and were maybe halfway through.  I don't recommend this.  The only \"benefit\" of eating the giant burger is that if you finish, they will wheel you back to your car/hotel in a wheelchair.  I understand this place has a lot of bad publicity due to it's clearly awful food for you.  People have actually had heart attacks there.  But, in full honor of America, this place will serve you potential-death on a plate and even serves you for free if you weigh more than 350 lbs.  I don't agree with this encouragement of handing really bad-for-you free food to an overweight individual, but if they are there, it's their choice I suppose.    Honestly, check it out if you wanna say you went there.  Get the small burger.  Feel like crap for a few hours.  Tell your friends.  Never go back."}
{"text":"Omg.  Fun place to try at least once.  Food is what is advertised FULL OF FAT I felt bloated and had belly ache for hours after But it was good.  The service was fun.   Must try while in Vegas if not dieting"}
{"text":"This place is literally a heart attack waiting to happen.  I was in Arizona visiting one of my best friends and he wanted to take me to Heart Attack Grill because he heard about it on Travel Channel's Best Places to Pig Out and had never gone.  As a consumer of large foods, I went for the quadruple bypass burger and it was indeed large.  They cook everything in lard, so it was extra greasy and had complete flavor.  I was actually very impressed with the taste.  My first bit was delicious...granted, there were many more bites after.  I loved it and was able to finish the monster of a burger.  I did add some pickles to the burger since I needed it to get through all four layers and 2lbs of burger.  The fries were pretty good too.  Minus one star because the \"hot nurses\" were not that hot except for one (our server) who was kinda a B****.  She wasn't just that, but not even attentive when I needed an extra water.  Oh well...in the contest between Rube vs Heart Attack Grill's quadruple bypass burger...RUBE WINS!"}
{"text":"Not the cheapest burger place i know but is a super fun place! The unique kind of service where the server sits down and treats you like a hospital patient (while you wear a hospital gown) is really fun."}
{"text":"This place is just horrible ! I really wanted to try this place, not knowing they made their food to literally put u in the hospital! I was assuming it was jus a theme :/ ! ... I couldn't finish nothing I ordered everything was jus flooded with lard ! Then they only accept cash ! Jus horrible !"}
{"text":"The novelty of this place garners it some brownie points, and you definitely don't come here for the food.   Yes, scantily clad nurses will serve you your food, cheerfully chat you up, and be agreeable to a photo shoot at the end of your meal. You'll also appreciate the little things Heart Attack Grill does (i.e. conveniently placed mirrors at ass-level behind all the counters for any patron's ogling pleasure), and there's no shortage of little quirks that definitely give the place character (i.e. their refusal to serve any diet sodas).  The food kinda sucks, though. I'll admit I liked the huge and considerately chilled Coke bottle, but that's about it. The fries were quite...flaccid and stale, the burger didn't seem so fresh or special, and it was relatively pricey for the amount of sustenance you get. Even so, you don't need more than a single bypass burger, unless you're itching to be useless for the next few hours, or if you are a gorilla.   Yet the clever presentation of what might sound like a practical joke with poor taste makes this place worth visiting with some friends. You'll have fun, and you'll be plenty full by the end of it!"}
{"text":"One of our friends had the bright idea to come here and take the challenge of finishing the burger.  They have a large scale where you pile your group and do a pre-weighing before you chow down. We were at a total weight of 1200lbs. Seriously??  You have to put the medical looking gown before you are seated, which was interesting.  Our waitress was great, and was very attentive throughout our meal     We all ordered a burger from single to triple bypass.  I will say the burger was tasty, but then again why wouldn't it taste amazing with the loads of bacon and sodium? I have had to give some of the bacon up to one of my friends, there was about 15 pieces of bacon in my double.     A fun place to come, especially for bachelor party, as you can rib each other while you try to hammer down a triple stack burger.  We all finished (thankfully), so no one had to go through the physical pain of getting spanked.   What was our final weight?  Let's just say it was more than 20+ lbs.   It's water weight, I promise!"}
{"text":"The food was average at best.   No big surprise that there was no diet coke.  The Milk shake tasted more like a cup full of ice cream with some butter.  The staff was friendly and that was a positive. I wouldn't go back but i also have had much worse meals."}
{"text":"I love the total experience here. You have to get checked in, then you get your gown and then you are seated. The waitresses are all dressed as sexy nurses.  Downside is they only offer chili, onion, tomato, cheese and bacon to go in your burger. No pickles or relish etc. They also dont ask you how you want it cooked..  Upside is the shakes with brownie chunks in it is heavenly!! Its also freaking huge. Along with the single bypass burger.  Biggest upside is you get 3 spanks with a paddle if you dont finish your food.  Great to experience at least once, but unless you want a spanking from a hot nurse you better go hungry.  Fyi I didnt finish my food ;)"}
{"text":"Don't come here!!!! WORST customer service ever! Bar tender is the manager and is pathetic. Refused to open a bottle of Grey Goose that was clearly on the shelf. They only care about making money and spanking people who don't finish their burgers! What a waste of my time!"}
{"text":"I am glad I experienced this place after seeing it on the travel channel and other shows. I am giving it only 4 stars because I was actually disappointed in the food. I was like there is no way you can go wrong with chili, cheese on hotdogs and hamburgers or fries. Chili tasted canned and cheese did too!!! But the drink selection is creative and a must !!! I definitely would return for cocktails and the amazing service we received."}
{"text":"We were greeted by a doctor and a nurse. We sat down and a doctor came over to take our order, I jus wanted a single patty with no bread. My bf got a double with 10 slices of bacon. He was happy cuz he greedy. I had a old english beer like old school it came in a brown paper bag that read \"feeling ghetto\" I was like hell yeah..it was a fun atmosphere. No kids menu."}
{"text":"This place gets a 4 star because the burgers are good- not great. If based on food alone, it would get a 3, but the eye candy made it dabateable for a 5 star review.  Service was fast and friendly. All beautiful girls working. No guys, even the cooks were dressed in nurse outfits and booty shorts.  Anywhere I can order a burger (1/2lb - 2lbs), eat endless fries, take three shots of  Patrón and watch my burger get cooked by a gorgeous woman in basically a thong, is a place worthy to eat at.  Oh, if you eat the quadruple bypass burger (4-1/2lb patties) the \"nurse\" wheels you to your car in a wheelchair!!!  Go here, at least once- it's fun!"}
{"text":"This is by far the single worst restaurant experience of my entire life. I rarely ever write a review, but in this case, I wanted to make sure that anyone considering going to the disguising place is forewarned.  First, the \"food\". I took my family here because i thought it would be a fun, novelty experience. It was definitely different. Could have been cool, but instead, the place is a complete dump. The \"food\" was utterly disgusting. With burgers being the only thing on the menu, i would think that they could figure out how to make a good burger. Nope. Just a nasty grilled piece of the lowest quality beef they could find. Yuk.  Second, we had the displeasure of meeting the owner. He came across as a total sleeze ball which wasn't much of a surprise given the quality of his restaurant.  Eating here is probalby pretty close to what it must feel like to eat in a scummy strip joint. Do yourself a favor. Go anywhere else but here."}
{"text":"Awhile back I had the quadruple bypass burger with fries and I almost died.  Not because I had gone to Hamburger heaven but because it tasted like burnt charcoal.  I still ate the whole thing but it scared me to even think about going back again.  This last time I decided to give it one last try and brought my niece , her boyfriend and the nugget.  Well , I am happy to say.. Holy Cow ! I guess they finally got the bugs out.  The burger was juicy although cooked thoroughly, the hamburger buns tasted and as well as texture were like they were made fresh in the back.  It was a surprising redemption and I will definitely come back again.   Just remember folks !  CASH ONLY and if you don't finish your burger you get a spanking !  optional I would imagine.. hilarious none the less !"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Freemont Street many times, yet had never tried the Heart Attack Grill so we thought why not?!  My husband wasn't 350+ and he was thrilled by his actual weight (as he's been trying to lose).  I stepped on (only because no one there knows me) and was slightly disappointed, but whatever...  anyways... the hospital gowns are great in case you spill something.  We tried both the dog and the burger.  They were ok, nothing great unfortunately... BUT, the FRIES were AMAZING!!!  I haven't had fries that good in years.  I wish fast food restaurants still cooked with that fatty stuff, but now it's all healthy and fries just don't taste natural any longer... but these were terrific!  Our waitress was great as well.  Watching the spankings and hearing the Karaoke was super cool.  We'd go back with a group for sure.  The only reason I marked off 1 star was that the burger was dry and a bit overcooked.  Prices - thank God they weren't as bad as the rest of Vegas though!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pure HYPE and pure garbage. I'm all down for a fun time, but this is not it. For one, I had to look around for the entrance because when I went in there was no one in sight to greet us and there was the chain blocking the way. Then you have to get dressed up and all that crap just to go in and get seated. The place is cash only which is weird in the modern day and age where anyone can have a credit card reader. Quit being so cheap.  The \"nurse\" then sat down with us to explain their menu which listed only the few items they had available. She had a bit of an attitude when we said we wanted to look over the menu as we had never been there before. Pretty much nothing aside from hot dogs and burgers for main entrees. I ended up getting a burger which was just as average as any burger anywhere else. The other major peeve was that all the beverages came in bottles which means no refills for anything. I don't think I have ever sipped a Coke so sparingly.  It took us forever to get the attention of the staff for us to pay the bill because they are constantly either messing around or just hiding behind the counter playing with their phones. This place is essentially an over-hyped, cheap ass place that serves garbage food and horrible service."}
{"text":"This place is cool. I love the quirky decor.  Upon entering a man dressed in scrubs \"checked us in\" and put hospital gowns on us an and hospital bracelet.   Then we were seated and the waitress was wearing a cute skimpy nurses outfit. We had a terrible waitress. She barely checked on us and as I was still eating my fries actually reached and started pulling them away. I had to tell her I was still eating and not done. There were people in there but still many tables open so I saw no need to hurry us off. I also saw other customers had waitresses who were sitting at the table with them being friendly and even bringing a syringe with what appeared to have melted butter or alcohol in it! That looked so cool but we were never offered anything like that.  I ordered the \"Flatliner Fries\" and they were fried in pure lard. They come out very black looking burnt but don't taste that way at all and were very good. They cost $1.84. I also ordered a \"Chocolate  Butter Fat Shake\" made with pure cream. It cost $4.62 and was delicious!  My man had a \"Single By Pass\" and that had 1 burger, cheese, onion and 5 slices of bacon. I tried a piece of the bacon and I have to say it was so yummy I am surprised that don't sell a side of it. This burger cost $7.39.  We liked it a lot and will go back again.  Please note that they only accept cash. The charge for pulling money out of the ATM was .75 cents however my card was charged $2.00. Maybe I read something wrong when pulling the money out.  They offer a souvenir menu on the way out but it does cost a $1."}

{"text":"Really fun place. The food is too fat for me, but it's not about it there :) And actually the fun begins when you admit you cannot finish your meal..."}
{"text":"was with friends out of town , thought it would be fun.  wrong.  in an almost empty restaurant  they sat us near the window in front ( I am sure to make them look busy now that I look back)  most parties there were put near the front windows. it was 111 out that day.  they make you wear  hospital gowns, which is cute , but they are cotton.  and  it was not very cool in there.   as we waited here are screens every were  playing music videos ,  with there own interpretations of the video.    I look up at the screen and the first thing i see is a close up of JFK's  head exploding when he was assassinated.  not something i want to see as i order dinner.   ordered my burger  with out  chili , when i got it  it was obvious someone started to put it on and saw it was not supposed to have it , so they scraped it off , my 1/2  my burger tasted like chili  ( and not good chili)   the burger itself was ok .  about what I expected form a gimmick place.   then as we finished our meal , the sun had crept down and was hitting me in the back , i was sweating, so i took off the gown  as my friend went to go use the restroom before we left.   our waitress ( who was good )  came  and asked me to put it back on, i told her  what was up and she asked could i just drape it over me a bit for now then,  she was nice so i said sure.  not a min. later  another waitress came and said , sir I am sorry you need to put that on or leave the building .  so  I just left. making sure to tell the hostess  , that if they are sitting someone in the sun and force them to wear the gown they should turn the air up .   was not a good time  had.  the food was only ok, you did get a nice size burger, a little over cooked.  the  water is bottled and cost as much as a coke  ( which is a small glass bottle type )  no refills .  Verdict  take friends  to a good steak place for the same price"}
{"text":"More of a place to just go to once to say you did...and survived! I think the prices were very reasonable. The burgers are good but greasy; just know that when you decide to come here. The entertainment of people getting paddled is perhaps the best part."}
{"text":"This place was amusing. It is a hospital themed restaurant in downtown. There is a weigh machine inside and can be seen outside  that customers that weigh more than 350lbs eats free. Once you enter, the hostess and waitress dressed in nurse uniform comes and help you get into a hospital gown and a bracelet similar to what you would wear at the hospital. The waitor and waitresses (\"nurses\") take orders (\"prescriptions\") from the customers (\"patients\"). Each patient wears a hospital gown before ordering and those who do not finish their meal receive a paddling by one of the \"nurses\" with the option to buy the paddle afterwards. I had a burger and I couldn't finish it and had no place to hide it, I tried. The male nurse gave me 3 wacks while my friends videoed me and laughed their butt off. It was all a good fun but man did it hurt!  The menu includes \"Single\", \"Double\", \"Triple\", and \"Quadruple Bypass\" hamburgers ranging from 8 to 32 ounces of beef and all-you-can-eat \"Flatliner Fries\" (cooked in pure lard), beer and tequila, and soft drinks such as Jolt and Mexican-bottled Coca-Cola made with cane sugar. The food was okay but I thought it was a fun place to come and people watch being paddled so come with single friends or for ladies night out."}
{"text":"OMG! The best time ever! Yenny was our waitress and Madeline came by our table to add to the frivolity! Everyone had a blast! The foods good and plenty plus it tasted great! Service was absolutely amazing! The doctor even came out to our table to greet us.. I'll be back here again, after I run another 5K"}
{"text":"We have a friend that kept raving about this place!  So we decided to go and check it out.  As soon as we stepped in the doctor greeted us, and put on our hospital gowns!  They only accept cash, and they do have a ATM machine, it only charges .75 cents.  So we got our table!  It wasn't in a very good spot though, because if you don't finish your food, they will paddle you!  Where we where sitting, I couldn't see anything!  All I could do was hear it.  So our waitress came over, she was realy nice.  I can't remember her name.  But she let us know you can't share any food, I think she said only the single.  So I ordered the single with bacon I think it was about $9.50  And an order of fries about $1.80  and a bottle water, they only sell coke, and I don't drink coke unless I have crown royal in it!  lol  It seemed like it took a long time for our food, but we weren't in a hurry.  I kept hearing people get there butt spanked!  So our food finally came!  My single was pretty big, and the bun is really good!  Over all, it was just ok, the fries, just ok!  I think the big deal here are the nurses, and the spankings!  I could care less if I ever go back here again!"}
{"text":"The service was good. The decor feels a bit outdated and cheesy. The food was about as comparable as a frozen dinner. The worst part was eating the triple as it was too much sub par food."}
{"text":"This was hands down my favorite place I went to in Vegas! Definitely will be back when I come again!  I'm obviously over 350, so I got my burger for free! This is a cash only establishment, but there is an atm on location.   If you don't finish your food, you will be paddled by a beautiful nurse. Or if you want, you can be paddled for fun too!   The Jell-O shots are a lot of fun, and if you ask, a nurse will give you your shots! They serve wine in an IV bag, the burger was amazing. Coke also tastes best out of a glass bottle."}
{"text":"I stop here every time I visit.  Good burgers and fries.  Service is good.  A little pricey but its a good time.  All details provided up front ie cash only and paddle if you dont finish or opt out with karaoke.  I think its worth checking out."}
{"text":"Holy smokes!  My ass will never be the same.  Came here with a few friends for the first meal of the day, we were starving after a long sinful night.  It's vegas so we usually eat once and drink all day, saying that we came here to eat a fat burger to fill up the tank.  We came in put on our hospital gowns and got seated, it was my first time so i thought the whole experience was fun.  The nurses were nice and wore their costumes nicely, our waiter happened to be a guy which in the end we realized that's who would be spanking us...wah wah waaahh... total fail! I didn't finish my burger and left just a couple bites , I guess you can say i wanted to follow through with the whole experience.  Biggest mistake ever.  I was the first in line to get spanked, I looked around for a female nurse that i can call out to do the job but before i knew it.. SMACK!!! he went for the kill.  This was the beginning of my end.  I cringed and the crowd which usually make a \"ooow\" sound stayed quiet, they felt my pain.  The next two spanks were no different I felt like I would never be able to sit again.  My friends were up and they went through the same, their expressions were priceless but mine was the most painful and we have a video to prove it.  I shoulda finished that damn burger damnit! I would of preferred to be constipated from that tasteless meat patties than to get spanked like that ever again. The food and ambiance are not that great. All in all i can say I won't be coming back here again and if i do it's to get some payback on a poor unexpected soul.  3 stars for the experience. 0 for the spanks :("}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant! Not your average place to eat. Don't expect variety, they have a basic menu. Every clean and good customer service. I spilt the bypass burger because it too much for me to eat. The meat was tasty, quality buns, fresh onions and tomatoes."}
{"text":"This place will deffinently clog your arteries. Lol amazing food and great atmosphere.  Such a great experience. I recommend stopping in here if you have the chance. Deffinently a must stop! Just make sure you finish your burger, otherwise it's spanking time!!"}
{"text":"it was my first time here and brought my friends from Singapore, heard this place is a awesome, scared to order too much, coz as the moment we enter the restaurant a lot of people have been spanked on their butt for not finishing the food.. hahaha honestly their burgers are tasty and they have friendly nurses. its a place to visit where you want to experience Vegas... will definitely comeback and bring some more friends out of state and country"}
{"text":"The picture says it all.  Doctors and nurses serving you a burger and fries.  How can you go wrong with that type of a theme restaurant?  Surprisingly, the burgers were pretty good.  Juicy and cooked just right.  I ordered a double bypass (no cheese) and could not finish it.  While I was there I watched someone eat a quadruple bypass.  Not a pretty sight but memorable.    I love the customer service here.  The nurses were all very friendly.  Always willing to pose for pictures and chat."}
{"text":"First of all I want to say that I didn't eat any burgers or fries when I went. My husband and I were strolling on Fremont St and wanted a desert.   The initial greeting was great!!! I thought it was too funny that you have to put on a hospital gown when entering and that there is a giant scale in the middle of the restaraunt. Also the waitresses are dressed as sexy nurses.   Unfortunatley for the people waiting for their burgers the grill had broke and there was no food coming from the kitchen for about 15 minutes. I personally think that the wait staff could have handled it better by informing their customers.  Other than that it was a fun place to check out. The milkshake was probably the most unhealthy thing I've ever had. You can't drink it but thankfully they give you a spoon. There was also a chunk of butter sitting right on top of the very stiff shake.   This place is definatly for people that aren't worried about calories."}
{"text":"We visited Fremont Street and stopped here for lunch. Being a fan of themed restaurants, we thought we'd try it. I immediately hated the theme. It's a hospital for craps sake. Sorry but sickness and food don't pair well. And the little hospital gowns have got to go.   My husband ordered a burger and fries. The fries were brown. THEY WERE BROWN! How the hell do you get brown fries?? The burger was gross. He only ate half of it. When ordering, the waitress/nurse warned if you didn't eat it all then you get a spanking. What hospital spanks?? A porn hospital maybe. Whatever. I think I gave out the \"don't even freaking touch us\" vibe, because she didn't.   I ordered a chocolate butterfat shake, not knowing what they meant by \"butterfat\". It came with a pat of butter in it, like some kind of garnish. Butter is not a garnish for ice cream. Blech!  Oh and.... It's cash only. Seriously? Ok I get the joke of \"no checks, you might die before it clears\" as fitting in with the whole hospital theme. No restaurant takes checks. But geez, take debit cards.   Food not good. Theme is horrible. I don't recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is worth going to at least once, especially if you go with an 350+ lb friend who is willing to step on the scale and get the glory/shame of eating free all night long. We did, and it was a riot.   I'm not a crazy burger fan, but this place was highly entertaining. We got a seat right by the slapping bar where people got their butts smacked when they don't finish their food (and those girls don't hold back either). That's enough motivation to clean up your plate.  The decor is cleverly done too. The TV plays a variety of music videos, some even customized to the Heart Attack Grill, including one \"wtf?\" one with a little person and Ron Jeremy lip-synching to \"Summer Lovin'\" from Grease.   I love the little menu touches too. If you ask for lettuce they say \"we don't have anything green\". They don't serve diet drinks either because, why bother? They DO have cane sugar soda which was actually really cool, and somewhat ironic because people would argue real sugar might even be healthier than the usual High Fructose Corn Syrup. If you order wine it comes in an IV and the receipt lists tax as \"government theft\". It's all very clever.  The burgers themselves were actually quite impressive, even the dinky one-patty burger. For $10 it's actually a reasonable deal considering you'll pay that much anywhere else, and the burgers are a good size. You can easily split a burger if you're worried about not finishing one. I got fries too and even though they were fried in deep lard, they didn't really taste any different.  I'm glad I went, but I don't see myself going back again anytime soon. It's probably not a place you'll go regularly (unless you are over the 350 lb mark). Also keep in mind that it is CASH only and they do not let you bring in outside drinks, including water."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, great music, LARGE portions and I had the milkshake...I think it will take me a week to burn off the butterfat in it!! Service was excellent. Husband barely finished single burger &  he's a burger King!! Give it a go!!"}
{"text":"I just had a late lunch at the Heart Attack Grill in Las Vegas and I come away with mixed feelings.  The burger(s) that we had were great, as advertised with plenty of well-done beef, lettuce, onions, tomato, cheese and a great hamburger bun.  My double and my buddy's triple were held together with long wooden skewers.  The french fries were also good, as advertised and came hot however they were limp, not crispy as I had anticipated.  The \"nurses\" that waited on us were all very enthusiastic, very attractive and helpful however it took some initial time for the \"orderly\" to take our order, and that was only after I flagged him down to tell him that we were ready to order.  His excuse was that he thought someone else had taken care of us however we had nothing in front of us other than the menu(s) that we had put down on the counter.  He  arrived with one chocolate milkshake and one Coke but we had both ordered milkshakes.  My buddy wanted vanilla, but we were told that only chocolate was available.  The music was loud but tolerable, rock with videos on the screens on the walls and the party atmosphere was noticeable.  I wonder where they obtained the mannequins that were dressed as nurses up behind the bar, as the well-endowed figures were the best I've ever seen.    Now, for the very negative, yes, the milkshakes come with a pat of butter, but of the two flavors offered, they had no vanilla available and the chocolate milkshake(s) were the WORST EVER, tasting, by both me and my buddy.  We could not consume more than ten percent of the milkshake in the clear plastic glasses in which the shakes arrived.  Worst tasting shakes ever. (did I already say that?)  I will go back, but I will not order the shake(s).  I should have accepted the Coke that was brought to me by mistake.  Next time I'll know.  Did I say the \"nurses\" were attractive and friendly?"}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun, and a bit out of control. For starters, bring an appetite! The food is huge, the amount of fat and cholesterol is way beyond what you should eat in a week, let alone in one meal, and the environment is loud and obnoxious. That said, it is a lot of fun, and if you are very hungry and looking for great burger, check it out. You will feel the need to eat salad the rest if the day, perhaps the week, but still a fun experience and a must see."}
{"text":"The burger was good not to mention the lard replaced the mayo.  I enjoyed the unlimited fries but wish they more side selections besides coke, water, beer, and unfiltered cigarettes!   Come on, some of us drove straight from OC to try it and would like a god damn Diet Coke!"}
{"text":"This place was cool, not AMAZING, but cool. My husband and i went here with my sister and our daughters last weekend, and we enjoyed the entertainment, but the food was not as top notch as i thought it would be. The waitresses were very nice, and attended to all our needs. I would recomend coming here at least once, but not to make it a regular thing. I would have to say Five Guys or even In and Out burger are better burgers than here. Other than that everyhting was pretty good! :)"}
{"text":"So I went with a friend from Tucson who wanted to check out the Heart Attack Grill on Sat,  since it was my 1st time their my friends  pre-warned me that this place cooks in lard, everything with lard so I went prepared. Walked in and was shock to see that everyone eating wears a hospital gown but I got accustomed to that pretty fast seeing how everyone was wearing one to not wear one I would stand out.  The waitresses where cute nurses ready to help with our procedures and the cooks where Dr's. The place was decked out nice, but you definitely are not coming to Heart Attack Grill for fat free food.  The menu was simple, 4 different burgers to choose from, unlimited fries (which you can't share) drinks are tall bottle of Coke or water (guess that's the closest your getting to diet) or 2 types of bottled beers to choose from and a crazy thick milkshake.  The fixings for burgers are near the grill, you choose from pickles, onions, tomatoes and jalapenos; next to the fry station were also the condiments of catsup, mayo and mustard.   I ordered a single bypass with cheese and of course the fries and a coke.  The fries I have to say are the best fries I have had in a long time, man they where good.  The burger, even though it was good I found it lacking in seasoning, maybe it could have been hit with some salt or pepper. My friend ordered the triple bypass and he thought it was great!       Yes I would go back again!!"}
{"text":"I will just be straight upfront; are they unhealthy, yes!! Is the fries cooked in pure lard, yes! Is the coke made from real sugar, yes!  But you know what, even though this place is unhealthy it is defiantly a place to experience once in your life time. Where else can you go where waitresses dress up like nurses and serve you food, or doctors as cooks? A place where you have to where a hospital gown and a wrist band and there is no exceptions? Their really isn't any other place like this.  It is true though it is really bad for you it sure does taste good! So if your in need of a good burger and fries and an experience to go with it this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"CASH ONLY.  Fun little place. Service was satisfactory and the food was mediocre. More of a novelty place to take people who have never been to old Vegas. Wouldn't be sad if I never made it back there again."}
{"text":"5 stars with Our server Ricky and the other girls. The staff truly make it an experience. The food was basic- burgers and hot dogs but the wine IV is a must try! Such a fun place and such a fun staff!!"}
{"text":"Hungry?  Thirsty?  Lazy?  In need of sexy scenery?    Well, there's a one-stop shop for all your needs down in Chandler, AZ.  It's called, Heart Attack Grill and lemme tell ya, it lives up to it's name.  You can take care of your hunger with a double, triple, or quadruple bypass burger and an all-you-can-eat French fry bar, ease your thirst with an old-fashioned coca-cola straight outta the glass bottle (from Mexico even so it's real sugar), and even get your lazy butt wheeled out to your car by sexy nurse waitresses after you've finished (if you order the giant burger)!   What could go wrong you ask?  Well, very little, imo.  I went to Heart Attack grill fully expecting a greasy, over-the-top experience and I was not let down.  First impression, the bright red and white emergency motif, nurses in cute uniforms, good oldies kinda music and powerful smell of... lard? LoL  My friend and I both ordered the single bypass burger, cokes and he got the all-you-can-eat fries (no sharing allowed but that's ok because it's cheap - 1.85 per person).  Our burgers came out a little while later and lemme tell ya, even the buns were coated in grease.  I noticed not everyone had that slick shiney bun though so people in the know must order without the extra juice.  Really, I could've done without the extra slippery lard buns but other than that, it was a decent burger and a fun experience.  Things I liked - the old videos playing on flat screens above me, the waitresses who bent over while talking to other customers so I could check out their bootays, the almost all female staff (only 1 male), and the funny sad fact that anyone over 350lbs eats for free.  Gross.  Things I didn't like - it was pretty messy... I guess cute cosplay waitresses don't really clean as well as regular waitresses do, the waitresses could've been more curvy (of course I like girls a lil think anyway), the greasy buns that fall apart a lil while u try to eat em, AND... the funny sad fact that anyone over 350lbs eats for free.  Gross.  If I lived in Arizona, I'd probably go every once in a while, just for fun and of course, to entertain guests.  Not a good date spot. LoL  The manager guy was really nice though... he even played 'California Lovin' for me over the flat screens.  I told him if he opens a joint in Tokoyo, I'll go be 'head nurse' for him!    Another cool thing, starting in October, they're going to have a live band on Saturday's from 2-7.   I guess some of the guys in the band have history with Alice Cooper and kinda with Metallica.  Neat.  I'll be back to AZ in November and I'll have to come by and check it out again.    See ya there!"}
{"text":"Extremely FUN!!!  The food was delicious and our sexy Nurse Lola was a sweetie! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves a fun theme and a good burger.  Word of warning: Don't order more than you can eat! If you don't finish your burger, you'll get a spanking from your nurse! :-)"}
{"text":"I rate this four stars because of the concept.  I mean who does not want to be spanked by a dwarf dressed in a nurses uniform if you don't finish the meal?  Everything they do here is their way not your way.  So you are not going to get your heart attack your way.  Want lettuce? nope not going to get it too healthy.  Want silverware? nope use your hands.  Want to use a credit card?  nope cash only.  Want a diet coke?  Nope you are here for a heart attack pure cane sugar soda only.    I ordered a double cheese burger with bacon and onion no tomato.  Nope.  I received a double cheese burger with bacon, onions tomato and chili.  If you are inside trying to die of a heart attack why worry about getting the order correct?  The burger was not bad not great.  But the 10 slices of bacon sure made that burger different.  Mrs. K. did not finish her hamburger. Knowing full well that she was going to get spanked by a dwarf in a nurses uniform.  The brave Mrs. K. took her remaining burger hid it in a bunch of napkins and the server dressed as a nurse did not see she hid the burger.  Then we paid and ran."}
{"text":"So, we just had to try this place out after seeing stories in the news this past year. There is an old timely ambulance out front which really sets the scene. If you want a big greasy meal in a tourist attraction, eat here. The wait staff are dressed as nurses and right up front is a blood pressure machine and scale if you want to get a baseline before inhaling 1000s of calories. It was sad that Texas was all over the Top 10 list of folks with high blood pressure. We ordered one burger to split, fries and Coke. Actually pretty good but there were much cheaper options in the area. I would return if we had friends with us who are new to the Vegas experience."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, and fun concept. I recommend coming here with a hungry appetite if you don't want to sing karaoke or get spanked by a nurse."}
{"text":"Nicht besonders zu empfehlen, die Mega burger sind war nett und ein Highlight zum anschauen aber leider nur fettig und knorpelig.... Das Ambiente ist nett mit den Krankenschwestern aber das war es leider auch schon...."}
{"text":"First off, this place has a doctor/nurse/patient theme too it. The price of the food is decent. Menu is very simple as you can only choose burger and fries. There is no sauce or lettuce which comes with the burgers (comes with cheese, onions, meat, bavon, bread).  I didn't care too much about the texture of the lard cooked fries but the taste was good.  The only condiments available are limited (ketchup, mayonnaise, and mustard). Did not have an option of getting additional sauces (bbq, ranch, etc).  The butterfat milkshake has a great taste too it but is quite rich and fattening. Also, there was free fresh made cotton candy. Yum!  Service was adequate. This particular establishment has very cute waitresses with personalities which compliment the atmosphere. Veronica, our waitress, did an excellent job of serving and letting us know about the quirks of the menu. The staff made the experience worthwhile.  Overall, fun place to eat and quality of food fits the bill. Don't forget to tip the weight scale before and after! Have fun and give compliments to Veronica!"}
{"text":"The single was enough for me,  it was a pretty good burger, we also had the onion rings.  I wasnt impressed with the rings, they were almost cakey with the batter.  Also had a black cherry soda that was great.  Overall a decent meal that I finished."}
{"text":"If you don't finish your order here, you get paddled by one of the nurse/servers. But the real punishment is eating the food. Brilliant marketing: unhealthy food, calories abound. Yeah we get it. If only they had put a percentage of that thought into their recipes. How do you screw up a big burger and fries/onion rings? Well, in that, they have a doctorate. Let me tell you how bad the food was here. Our teenage son, who eats EVERYTHING--barely touched his burger. Trust me--we can barely keep this kid fed--and he couldn't wait to get out of there. He even took the paddling--because it was better than eating the food."}
{"text":"The concept is gross, the food is sub-par, but if your drunk on the strip in Old Vegas it's fun to go once.  They put a hospital gown on you when you sit down, it's fun.  Then you order a heart clogger burger.  All burgers and fries are cooked in lard.    So bad for you, but a decent burger.  It could be much better.  Good looking girls in nursing garb serve you a grease laden burger.  Not the worst idea.   Sub-par food, all grease, hot women servers.   2 stars  Thanks"}
{"text":"We stopped here because I love burgers and this was a must stop. Once you enter you are placed in a hospital gown that you have to wear the whole time. We both ordered the smallest burger you could. You can share the smallest one but not the others. I got everything on mine including the chili and I must say it was really good. I didn't get any fries but my man did and they were decent. I wasn't expecting the burger to be that good honestly. I ate it all and so did my man. We did however witness allot of people getting spanked for not finishing their meals. Plus you can ask to be spanked even if you do finish your meal. We skipped that option. One poor guy got the sh*t beat out of him because he said after the 1st spank that it didn't hurt at all. Well after she was done with him he looked like he could cry. Everyone is watching while they do this too. They have cute \"movies\" playing of the waitresses reenacting popular shows. The star wars one was the best. The décor is clever as well. Two single burgers, one fry and two waters we were out of there for about $26.00. Great price for the food and the entertainment. Later I didn't feel like I over ate either. I loved this place honestly and I will return once we are back in Vegas. Next time I will do the hot dog because it looked delicious."}
{"text":"Came here with coworkers and wanted to experience some fun stuff for my first Vegas trip. I have been doing so good on my diet and then this place happened! With names like the \"quadruple bypass\" and \"flat liner fries\" and \"coronary dog\" I knew I was in trouble. I really didn't think the food was going to that good but I think it's pretty hard to mess up a burger. I was pleasantly surprised to find a really flavorful, tender and juicy burger once I bit in. The bun was really good. It was light and crispy but warm and doughy on the inside. You get a hospital gown when you come in which comes in handy . You will not leave this place clean. If you don't finish your meal then you get a sparking by one of the waitresses dressed in a nurses outfit. Not just a little paddling either!! I'm talking a down right hard spanking! If in the Fremont district check it out. It's definitely an experience."}
{"text":"Wait was not worth it to be honest. It's a place to go with friends, not family. Food was way too much to eat and the quality was poor."}
{"text":"So yes, while I was in AZ I had to try the Heart Attack Grill. Simplified menu makes the place more of a novelty and gimmicky. The burger was good, the bun was one of the best parts of the meal and getting the all you can eat fries cooked in lard was good. Not much more beyond that, just scantily clad women serving burger, coke or PBR."}
{"text":"They say to never judge a book by it's cover and never judge a restaurant by their sign outside it's doors, but in this case, you pretty much can since the \"Heart Attack Grill\" sign did not really stand out, therefore making it quite plain like it's calorific burgers. From the moment I stepped into this burger joint, I just couldn't feel the good vibe in the air. Three friends and I went here on our way to our grand road trip from Chicago to Los Angeles to Las Vegas and back. The consequences of not coming here were that (1) we could have eaten some steak at Big Texan Ranch at Amarillo, TX and/or (2) we could have visited the Grand Canyon. Let's just say at the end, we would have rather done the other options instead. Although we still saw the giant chasm on our way home, we still missed out on some potentially good steak in Amarillo. So as soon as we walked in the HAG, I just had this weird feeling like when you're watching a scary movie and someone is about to die. But in this case, I walked in and had this feeling that these burgers aren't going to be that great.  One thought came to mind when I first heard of this restaurant: \"Hooters with Unhealthy Burgers?\" I decided to come here because this place was #39 on the Travel Channel's \"Chow Down Countdown\" list; also because the waitresses are dressed as naughty nurses. From the segment, the place looked like a party. It was quite the opposite when my friends and I went. It seemed dead, although to HAG's defense, we came there on a Tuesday at 6:30, 2 hours before the restaurant closes. There were only two young nurses working as well as the head (older) nurse. The two young nurses were attractive but one of them was quite snobby.   OK now to the burger. It was cooked real well and full of calories, lard, fat, and did I mention calories? I must say it was an \"okay\" burger but not in the \"Got to have again!\" category. With the unlimited fries that swam in lard, it's the same concept. I wasn't a big fan of getting my own condiments in the condiments bar. The same \"CNN Heart Attack Grill portion\" clips was being played over and over on a loop throughout their big screens, rather than them showing sports. The aroma of a real hospital and the smell of lard also didn't help the cause.   I had the Triple Bypass Burger and I was only able to eat it halfway. Overall, I can try to justify my 2-star rating because in my opinion, these burgers were not that great to me. My three other friends would definitely agree with me. Let me explain: Keep in mind that we were driving from Chicago to pass by Chandler non-stop. I don't know about my friends but I came through HAG's doors after being in a car for over 24 hours on a lightly filled stomach. Maybe it was the lard fries or the sugar Coke filling me up a little, but I didn't get the satisfaction from eating half of my burger. I actually got a better satisfaction from eating a Big Mac throughout the years. When it comes down to it, you eat here once and you'll probably not come back again, unless (1) you weigh over 350 lbs. and can eat for free, (2) You have paid the $500 annual membership fee to have 3 daily paid meals, or (3) you just want to check out the \"nurses.\"   I think my friends still have not forgiven me for taking them here. But to me, it's one of those, \"Place wasn't so great, but I'm glad I still came here for I would have never known how it is.\" The Heart Attack Grill just didn't fill me up in the right way."}
{"text":"Heard of this place many of times especially on tv. I wanted to try it. But I didnt want to get spank. Seeing the nurses with that paddle spanking the customers hard very hard. I didnt want to be that person.  We came with a group of people we werent from Las Vegas. We were here for Darts Tournament but one person from the group came here before and he gotten spanked and he like it.   My boyfriend he is a big man he got on the main stage scale inside the restaurant and he weigh over 400 lbs  so he got a free burger. Wearing the hospital gowns was different but cool. I ordered a single bypass burger w/o the tomatoes it had bacon, cheese, onions, & chili w/ fries. When my food arrive I've had a lot of fries but you only get a spanking if you dont finish the burger not the fries. So my focus was on the burger.  I was kinda suprise on how the burger taste. I like it. I was able to finish my burger, but not my fries. My boyfriend was able to finish his too. Oh, since he got a free burger he can get another one but he didnt want another one.   Our nurse she was sweet and explain everything about the heart attack grill. Oh, and the guy who got spanked before he gotten spanked again but the thing was he did finish his double bypass burger but left a small piece on purpose because he wanted to get spanked again. Hearing that paddle to his ass was hella loud and he did say it hurt too.  I really dont have a bad experience there but it was a place I can cross off my list. And yeah I will go again."}
{"text":"This place is fun, yes a gimmick but fun none the less. I was not fond of having to wear a hospital gown, but it was worth the Experiance. The burgers were big, juicy, served on a great roll, fries are a little thin for me, but came out crisp and tasty. I ordered a single bypass, was considering a double and was so glad I didn't. The single is more than enough food.  Look for no diet drinks here, full sugar coke, shakes, wine, beer, and cocktails. Wine served in I.V. Bags, shots in pill bottles, another fun gimmick.  The service was good and Casey was a dynamite waitress, loved the old time makeup with the bright red lipstick. She was playing a part and did it well.  I could not believe the spankings, these girls really smack the $h!t outta you and seem to enjoy it. I saw 2guys get their spankings and they both walked away pretty red faced after their 3 swats with a wooden paddle."}
{"text":"I was majorly disappointed when my wife and I went to this location at the Hawaiian Marketplace.   Back in December my wife and I were walking around this area of the Strip, between Planet Hollywood and The MGM Grand. It was rainy, slightly cold, and we were both quite hungry. When we first came across it we were surprised to discover that it had opened just a week earlier. We even met the owner, Jon Basso. When we went inside to dine, the place only had a few customers at tables. Hardly anyone at the bar. The WOW FACTOR that my wife and I received from the Fremont Street location was sorely missing.  About 4 or 5 years ago we went to the location on Fremont Street, the atmosphere and food were out of sight. We had a blast, just read my review here on YELP!  This trip was just not the same. I ordered a triple-bypass. A three patty bacon cheeseburger. It just wasn't the same. The location at Fremont Street, I ate a quadruple-bypass, a four patty bacon cheeseburger. I absolutely loved this. The triple-bypass was bland at best.  This location heavily advertised that if you don't finish your meal, you get a spanking. My wife didn't finish her meal, so she took the spanking. I also didn't finish my meal, I DIDN'T WANT TO FINISH MY MEAL!   I didn't get spanked either.  Bottom line, if things don't improve, this location of the Heart Attack Grill will be a flat-liner."}
{"text":"Yes, I will admit to it...I did come here after hearing about the unofficial spokesperson passing away from a Heart Attack himself a couple of weeks earlier.  Yes, I wanted to see what this place was all about, and of course I had to eat the food and see what everybody was saying about this place was true.    I was happy that I did give this place a try \"once\" but if I am looking for a great burger joint, this would not be on the top of my list of place to hit first.  When you arrive, you will sign a waiver that basically protect the company when you do have heart attack from eating here, once you have passed that you are greeted by either a sexy nurse and doctor (let me tell you the sexy nurse is worth the trip here), at that point you are given a hospital gown, this will save time when you are rushed in to emergency room.  At this point you are seated and asked if you wanted something to drink, I will have to say the doctor I had waiting on me, was very friendly and fast at taking the order (order are placed through an iTouch, which is cool).  One more thing you should know about this place, if you are over 300lbs you can have a free burger if you are over 300lbs, and yes they will weigh you at the restaurant.   The food was OK, the burgers come in different sizes from one patty all the way up to seven patties, which would make for a very big burger, I personally had a double and that was just a bit more that I wanted.  The burgers have salt and pepper, but nothing more on the patty, the standard burger filing (lettuce, tomato, pickle and onions).  The bacon and cheese is a must on any burger, next time I will have to make sure I order more bacon.  The they add a scoop of chill, if I had known this I would have done without the chill, as it tasted like it was from a can and not fresh at all, so I would recommend add more bacon and skip the chill.  Again, I do not see me coming back unless I bring somebody that would like to give it a try, but if you want to have an experience while dinning, this is a fun way to do it.  I will not give it five stars due to the food, but everything else will receive some stars including the fast service they have.  The employees do make this place fun and thank you to them."}
{"text":"The staff at this place are a bunch of A-holes. They treated me and my family like crap. It was super hot inside the place at the time we were there. My Mother is old and was in the middle of having hot flashes so she decided to pull the hospital gown off to cool down (They make everyone put on a hospital gown over your clothes when you walk in to be seated). The waitress came over and demanded she put it back on. My Mother declined and explained her situation. The waitress didn't care and went to get her moron manager who was dressed up like a doctor. The same transaction took place between him and my Mother and he kicked her out of the restaurant for not putting it back on. We were all stunned to say the least.   Both the manager and that waitress acted like total douche bags. Needless to say, we did not leave a tip. I hope this place burns to the ground."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the treatment they give you at this place. I'd say go for the experience and less of the food. The location  of this place is a great place right in the old Las Vegas downtown. Walking in it seems like a normal burger place, but everywhere instead of servers you have nurses. The decor was really nice I enjoyed looking at the remake of posters toward their advertisement. Also the set up In the middle of the resturant where the person will be spanked so everyone can see.  The nurse server we had was really nice. Even in her busy moments she took the time to talk and chat with us about eveything they had and go in a bit to her personal life.   The food on the other had was eh. I'm not much of a person the have their food cooked in lard I guess. I had the triple bypass which was their first burger to hit world record presumably. I finished it there alright I wasn't gonna get spanked. While mainly everyone went single and still struggled. But main taste was grease which I wished atleast have some flavor of something else.   But overall worth a try just don't get to hyped about it."}
{"text":"Ok this place is definitely worth checking out if you have seen it on tv.  They will smack your butt if you don't finish your food and they have some cool drink accessories.  The ambience is cool. However, the food is mediocre at best.  Get the onion rings. Not the fries.  The hamburger is okay.  Hot dog not so much.  Chili and cheese is less than desirable.  Definitely over priced.  With the money you spend you can get better food somewhere else."}
{"text":"Eh... not worth it.  Not good for kids.  Far from what I actually like.  They only cook it well done,  no ranch dressing,  hardly any fries.   Service was dismal."}
{"text":"I'm sorry everyone but you can tell me to lighten up but I have lost family members due to heart problems and heart attacks so I find this restaurant offensive and out of line.People shouldn't joke about these types of things because this is a common problem in america is people that are overweight and that have heart problems due to what they eat."}
{"text":"Avoid this place.   The burger was good. Not great, but very solid. (In case you like to mentally organize these reviews, that was the end of the positives) The fries were damp with fat and largely disgusting. The shake was frighteningly savory. It's all just too much. Also you can't get a glass of water. What the hell is up with that? The beer list is terrible. What's worse is the service.  We waited no minutes to get in and made up for it on the inside. Tons of servers wondering around, and all were apparently just power-walking to burn calories because I have family in Wisconsin I see more often than I saw my waitress. Two identical burgers came out separately. She forgot my Dr. Pepper order. Took us thirty minutes to get a check. We could've been out in 20 minutes, instead we were there for ninety. Waitress wasn't even particularly pleasant.  Cleanliness is an issue too. General restaurant wasn't too bad but the men's room is up there with a neglected gas station bathroom. Even the windows looking on to Fremont Street were dirty and smudgy. And if I'm noticing then it's really bad.   Also I want to note that I came to this place for the novelty and the charm. That lasts two minutes. That's not exactly right: the charm never existed, it just takes two minutes to be sure of that. Let me be clear: I like filthy moronic offensiveness. This is just the worst ideas off the sixth grade notebook of a particularly uncreative sixth grader. The abysmal beer list features an attractive waitress with the headline \"I like it in the can.\" Are they serious?  On the bright side I now appreciate the clever, well-run classiness and cheeky humor that is Hooters on a whole new level now; they're the Bellagio compared to this hovel."}
{"text":"I went here with my best friend because we saw this place on the Food Network and it looked really cool to try. I wanted to go just for the experience but the food was actually really great and would definitely go again! PS. Split the single bypass with a friend and definitely get the onion rings instead of french fries!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre food. This place is supposed be about the environment but it's just ok and I saw some people get viciously paddled because they didn't finish thier burgers. Hope they have good lawyers!"}
{"text":"Burger overcooked, fries undercooked, if you are only doing burgers and fries it needs to be a lot better.  Very annoying that you cannot get a glass of water.  I liked the theme, the staff is friendly and cute in their uniforms.  One time trip for me, I will not go back or recommend.  There are too many good burger joints to choose from."}
{"text":"It is sooo bad, but you can't help try it. It's 100 percent schtick, 0 substance. I just got back from eating there, and I'm in a fat coma. The only way I got anyone to join me was insisting on it for my birthday. After eating there I hope I have another.  Low quality frozen hamburger patties. All the food seems flavorless, and un-seasoned.  The vodka shake had plenty of vodka, and very thick of butter fat. Service was good, and I did receive a hard spanking. (literally) This is a place for those it college who also enjoy burritos bigger than your head.... And I'm well passed that"}
{"text":"Defiantly a fun experience! We only went for the \"shots\" and \"IV\" wine. We did not eat the burgers though. You walk in and are put into a hospital gown and taken to your table. The staff was all very friendly and in costume. Just a heads up... CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"I took my son here as he is the only who can afford the heart attack lol...a quite fun experience overall...rather u eat or not every patron must Don a gown lol..ok the place has lots of fat food decor but mostly has a cafeteria or small diner feel...Burgers and alcoholic beverages are over priced but everything else pretty reasonable...he had the single bypass and added bacon along with fries and a drink and that was around$17 w/o tip...He said it was the best burger he'd ever had...I had a.nibble and I'd have to second the notion it was indeed a tasty burger...the place was clean waiters nice..however not so attentive..ours was but noticed others weren't...oh btw sign on door says atm 75 cents well it's not so heads up...besides that it was A-Ok"}
{"text":"Tried this place in early October. Burgers were *meh*.  Huge patties not not much taste other than the bacon. Fries were kind of oily, seemed to have been in the warmer for a while. Not crispy or anything.  If you want to go there for the novelty and gimmicky experience, then maybe a place to check out once.  * burger - 1 star * fries - 1 star * friendly \"nurses\" - 4 stars  Well, I can say that I ate there at least once !"}
{"text":"We wanted to check this place out after hearing about it on various food shows and its reputation. We walked in and the hostess let us know that the whole restaurant was hospital themed and that we would need to wear hospital gowns to enter.  This was interesting to us, since obviously other people wear these and that means that they were eating in these - so fingers crossed that they are cleaned after each person, but I highly doubt it.  After getting our gowns on we were sat and looked over the menu. Everything was a bit more pricey than your average burger joint, but obviously you are in a tourist area, and everything is a bit more here.  The cheeseburger was good, but not the best ever.  The fries we didn't really care for.  The theme and decor were fun and kitchy, and you can tell they gear what they do to the tourist, one-time patron, crowd. I doubt locals frequent this place.  The cash only part was a big downer.   Overall: C+ The decor and theme are a novelty thing, but the food is just okay and after doing it once, I highly doubt we'd ever go back."}
{"text":"This place is sooo over rated.....I would say go here once just to experience it, but really there is no reason to visit twice.  The burgers were just okay, and the fries looked nasty and were sooooo greasy....litterally ours were like eating soggy soaked french fries.  We also ordered the milkshakes that had a piece of butter on top, gross!  The milk shakes were good (vanilla better than chocolate) but just seeing that peice of butter on top is so unappealing.  I can't believe that this place was started by a heart sergean! Also, if you weigh over 350 lbs you eat for free....just really bad messages throughout.  The whole idea kind of disgusts me.  I mean I guess most places you would go out to eat are prob not much more lean in cuisine than this place, they just advertise it and use it as a gimmick...but it doesn't make me want to go back.  I guess, if there were ever a city for a cafe like this to prosper it would be in Vegas.  Anyway, when you go in you have to wear a patient smock, which is interesting...at least you don't have to worry about getting your clothes dirty....and all the waiters are dressed like nurses.  Also, the waiters take the orders on an itouch looking device, so don't think they are being rude and looking at their phone while they're taking your order!  Also, make sure you are sure about what you order cause once the order goes through they cannot change it ...and warning~! They only take CASH!  But there is an atm at the front of the establishment."}
{"text":"This place opened up about a year before I left Vegas and I didn't get to try it before I moved.  So on our most recent visit, we decided to stop by and give it a try.  When you walk in, you have to \"check-in\" with a nurse.  She explains that you have to put on a hospital gown to eat, no exceptions.  It was kind of cheesy, but we decided to go through with it.  We put the gown on and got seated.  The place is unapologetic about the calories, fat content, and \"unhealthiness\" of their food....I love it.  It's decorated with items that pay homage to the Burger and fast food in general.  Great atmosphere!  After browsing the menu, we decided to order:  Single Bypass Burger w/Chili, $8.33 w/Bacon add $.92 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/heart-attack-grill-las-vegas?select=uj3i3yx8JLKs3lPRgX-DPg#uj3i3yx8JLKs3lPRgX-DPg http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/heart-attack-grill-las-vegas?select=QQIixogPUXOCtbBApuY8uA#QQIixogPUXOCtbBApuY8uA  Double Bypass Burger w/Chili, $10.18 w/Fries add $1.85 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/heart-attack-grill-las-vegas?select=iMGyagPk5P5CEFeL-i2MTg#iMGyagPk5P5CEFeL-i2MTg http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/heart-attack-grill-las-vegas?select=d9VovEyM0XKeZtaXLsxx-g#d9VovEyM0XKeZtaXLsxx-g  24 oz Old English 800, $4.62 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/heart-attack-grill-las-vegas?select=XlYk2VgSXo9EnsgDwaW2KA#XlYk2VgSXo9EnsgDwaW2KA  While we were waiting for our food, we saw some people getting spanked really hard with a paddle by their nurse server....what the heck is going here?  We soon discovered that if you didn't finish your food, you'd get spanked really hard by your nurse....LOL!  You can't make this stuff up! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/heart-attack-grill-las-vegas?select=cUc5xHa4bttx2mE06C8WAg#cUc5xHa4bttx2mE06C8WAg  People were getting spanked like crazy throughout dinner....some people did it just so they could get pictures taken and posted on social media.  In case you don't have a social media account, they have a camera that takes your pic while getting spanked and posts it on their account for you...genius marketing tool.  After a short wait, we got our food order.  The 24 oz can of Old E came in a paper bag that says \"Feeling Ghetto?\"....LMAO, yep I sure did.  Hilarious. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/heart-attack-grill-las-vegas?select=XlYk2VgSXo9EnsgDwaW2KA#XlYk2VgSXo9EnsgDwaW2KA  I bit into my Double Bypass Burger....it was very good.  The Chili reminded me of Tommy Burgers back in LA....the Burger is large and heavy....but very tasty.  The Fries are large Steak-Cut Fries....also very good.  This thing had to be a ton of calories....but it was worth it!  We both finished our meals because we didn't want to get spanked.  It was a lot of fun and I would recommend trying it at least once.  Return Factor - 85%"}
{"text":"I heard about this on television as one of the places to try in Las Vegas...I think not.  Their burgers and french fries are cooked in lard. When I think of cooking with lard I would imagine it to be super greasy but really good. This was not the case. I got the one patty burger. The size was good, typical toppings but bland bland bland. The french fries were bland and super soggy. My friend tried one of the milkshakes made with butter. I didn't get to try it myself but he said the solid chunks of butter you get in your mouth is not pleasant.  The only part that I enjoyed was the theme of the restaurant. You get to wear hospital gowns and you don't have to worry about getting your clothes dirty.  If you want to check it out, come for the experience, not for the food."}
{"text":"More than I expected!!! I didn't know that all are required to wear hospital gowns to eat there and everyone is dressed up as a nurse or surgeon- The burger and hot dogs were both amazing- My husband said he would have liked the burger more with no chili but the burger itself was delicious. The, \"nurses,\" were all adorable and very personable. We were all offered to sing karaoke, and might have if the list had more to choose from. The karaoke song list was short but did have fun energetic songs that everyone would probably know. Would I take my grandkids? Sure! It's a one of a kind time! The only reason I gave it only 4 stars is because even though it's called the Heart Attack Grill, it would be super cool if they had at least one or two healthy options only because some of us really just can't eat like that. It was a great time, and the food was good, but I could only take a taste of each thing due to health conditions- I would still go back though! It was a great time, a different and fun experience had by all"}
{"text":"Waren im November 2014 im Heart Attack Grill & es war einfach genial. Die Aufmachung mit Krankenschwestern & den OP Hemden, einfach genial. Die Bedienungen waren echt freundlichen und hilfsbereit. Zum Essen selber, einfach klasse. Ich esse echt gerne Bürger & um so größer der Bürger, umso besser. Uns hat der Bürger sehr gut geschmeckt. Es tropfte kaum Fett raus, wie man es bei manch anderen Bürgern kennt und geschmacklich war er auch super lecker.die Frage stellt sich nur, wie isst man solch einen Riesen Bürger ( hatte den Double )!?? Aber hat gerade noch so in den Mund gepasst.   Aber Vorsicht, wer was gesundes möchte, ist hier falsch.  Wer in Vegas ist, kann ich nur empfehlen, einen Abstecher in der Heart Attack Grill zu machen, es lohnt sich!!!! Preislich der Hammer und so etwas gibt es nur in den Staaten.  Ps: wählt mit Bedacht die Bürgergröße aus, oder Ihr bekommt eins auf den Hintern!!"}
{"text":"Great place to go and have a good time! Nurse Dominique was awesome. You better finish your order unless you want that spanking"}
{"text":"According to the news, did you know that two people have died eating here? To be fair though, I'm sure people die in restaurants all the time. I think this restaurant gets the publicity because of their name. So with that being said, let me start my review.  If you are totally sober and coming here for a gourmet burger and fries then you will be truly disappointed.  If you got the drunk munchies and/or want a possibly cool and unique experience then take risk and try this place.   LOCATION - As my wife and I were strolling along near the end of Fremont street (Past  the \"D\" hotel) and we noticed a huge scale and a sign stating \"350lbs and over eat free\". Then we noticed the name, Heart Attack Grill. I was immediately intrigued because I have never seen a restaurant advertise their establishment can possibly kill you. Most other places (Not going to mention names) that rhyme with onalds hide it.   ENVIORNMENT - So we walk in to be immediately greeted by the host. He then makes us put on a hospital gown and bracelet tag. FYI..the gown goes over your clothes. You don't have to get naked. We opt to sit at the counter because there is a gigantic screen behind the bar that plays famous youtube videos. This is one of the videos showing at the time http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMH0bHeiRNg The rest of the establishment is pretty big but the floors looked like it needed mopping. Almost like some real hospitals. I think the fact that the female servers are dressed in the old fashion nurse uniforms who give people spankings gives this scene a better experience. Too bad real hospitals don't do that though.     FOOD - The name Heart Attack matches the food they serve. They have 4 burger stages ranging from single bypass (1/2 pound) all the way up to quadruple by pass which is 2 pounds (What the people who died were eating). We decided on the single bypass because I was just there more for the experience and not a great tasting burger or to die. A Fatty, oily, greasy and messy burger is exactly what I was expecting and that is exactly what we got. I must admit that it lacked seasoning which made it flavorless and boring.  However, I can't dock them too much on that because the burger comes with crispy bacon. Nuff said..   Tip - If you get the Jello shot, it comes in a plastic syringe that you get to keep. Good for frosting your cakes. The shot is pretty strong.  SERVICE  during our time was very good. To be fair, it could have been because we were the only ones at the bar. Our server/bartender was friendly, prompt and knowledgeable.  She also told us that their burgers are not as unhealthy as they advertise them to be or as everyone thinks.  According to her, hey actually don't use lard.   OVERALL I would stay this place is a solid 3  1/2 stars for me but I was torn on my rating because I had great service, and I enjoyed the experience. However, I don't think this is a place I would come back to unless I had to.  I know that sounds contradicting but I am basically saying that it's a place worth trying at least once.  *CASH ONLY* - I know..that's a little weird."}
{"text":"Food was average but it was a fun time. My burger was great, but I'm not that picky. Boyfriends huge hotdog was too greasy, but he wolfed down 95% anyway. Soo because he didn't finish his meal the waitress wanted to spank him. We went with it and he got paddled 3 times in front of everyone and we still laugh about it. It's not a place for people who are uptight, but if you want a fun experience this place is worth it."}
{"text":"Great place for tourists.    I love bringing my out of town friends here. There's nothing like it.   The whole \"heart attack\" theme is entertaining. Cheesy but enteraining.  We saw a guy 350 get on the scale and ring the bell, yeah ! he eats FREE.  We had to wear the patient gown, (Except my wise 6 yr old, \"I'm not wearing that!\").  Funny!  And grateful when the grease drips.   Burgers were outrageaously greasy good. Had to split with my daughter that's how filling they were.    SHAKES ARE TO DIE FOR!!   God knows how may calories are in those, but if you like butter - order one!!!!!   The strawberry shake tastes like butter pecan w/ strawberries.  mmmm.   OK I suppose I have to mention the girls in the nurses outfits, it has a Hooters feel to it, but I would rather eat the food here than Hooters any day.     KIDS are welcome.  It's not as sleezy as Hooters.   It's like a 50's diner with a Hooters twist.   I would bring my out of state friends here again."}
{"text":"This place is not as bad as people say.  I am a big burger guy and this burger is good.  The fried onions they put on it will never make one of my burgers again.  The fries suck, very salty and maybe, just maybe, they were re-fried when ordered.  But...........due to the \"nurses\" serving the food we go from a 3 to 4 stars.  The entertainment is great and they take the time to talk to you.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Brought my mother here for Mother's Day after we did a Fremont Street Experience walking tour (I gave her a list of places she could choose from but we were both curious about this place).  I had heard of this place for years but neither of us had ever been here before.   When we arrived, we were brought into a changing room where the nursing attendant assisted us with putting hospital gowns on over our clothes.  Then our nurse waitress brought us to our table.  All of the wait staff is dressed like nurses- the girls are in revealing nurse uniforms.  The decor is very busy- lots of pictures all over the walls, and there are TV screens lining the tops of the walls.  They have altered a bunch of movie posters to fit their theme, which is unhealthy living and eat-to-die eating.  Some of the posters were clever.  However, be aware- the theme is very sexual (which kind of fits in with Fremont's more adult atmosphere), and there were several pictures that I was actually a little embarrassed I was responsible for my mother seeing.    We ordered a chocolate butterfat shake to share- it arrived with an actual slice of butter floating in it.  We also got a thing of fries to share- not sure what they fried them in, lard seems right.  Then, my mom didn't want chili and I'm allergic to onions, so we each got a single hamburger.  I added the optional bacon (comes in increments of 5- I got the minimum).  I can't even imagine how people can eat the octuple burger with 40 pieces of bacon without being sick the rest of the day.    So, all of the food tasted pretty good at first.  My mom said several times that she thinks it might have been the best shake she's ever had, but by the time we had finished 3/4 of it, neither of us wanted any more- you could taste the fat.  The fries were really good, but again by the time we had finished about half of them, they weren't tasting so good anymore.  I really, really wish I had forgone the chili (she had already forgone the onion) and we had shared a hamburger- first because I had an upset stomach most of the night and it was pretty obvious that it was the chili, second because each hamburger was approximately 2,000 calories according to the guy, and third because although the first few bites were really good (hamburger bun was really good bread), we had both lost interest for the last 1/4 of our burgers- taste doesn't justify the calorie count.    The only reason we finished the $30 food (1 fries, 1 shake, 2 single patty hamburgers- none of which tasted good enough to want to finish and a $2 bottle of water because they don't allow you to bring in your own beverages and don't let you have tap water) was the threat of being paddled by the nurses at the end if we didn't eat it all.  There was no way I was going to let my mother be paddled- we witnessed several people being hit, always men, and some of them had tears in their eyes when it was over.  One gruff-looking guy actually jumped and pulled away.  They were all trying to be good sports, but none of them looked happy afterwards.   Their CASH-ONLY policy was an unpleasant surprise- I was lucky I hadn't emptied my purse recently but I barely had enough to cover the bill on me (I'm a card girl).    I was also not pleased by their water policy- we had been on a walking tour so we both had water bottles with us- they forced us to put the water bottles away and not drink from them.  Then they charged us $2 for a small bottle of water because they won't give you tap water.    I've wanted to try this place out for years, and now I can cross it off my list.  It was an interesting experience, but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"The burgers are surprisingly good.  Big and juicy and flavorful. Even the buns are better than average.  Each patty is half a pound, so you know what that means with regard to the quadruple-bypass burger. (I had a double-bypass).  Unfortunately, like a lot of burger joints, including In&Out, the fries aren't as good as the burgers. They need to be double-fried so they're crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside.  Low-end beer and wine (Fat Bastard, how appropriate).  Having to wear a hospital gown will get tired after awhile for locals, but tourists will eat it up and take many photos to email home.  Two amusing things happened while I was there: 1. My friend asked for water, and was told they don't serve water because it has no calories. 2. A guy got on the scale in the middle of the restaurant, and tipped out at 477 pounds: he was wildly applauded, and of course ate for free.  Not the best burger in town (that title now belongs to The Barrymore), but it's better than the fast-food joints, and more fun than Smashburger, so it's worth a visit....at least once."}
{"text":"Very simple menu - and I wish they had explained that their burgers were going to have a chili flavor. Otherwise, I did share a single burger AND chili fries with the hubby. We just barely finished everything. No spanking for us.   You should definitely consider coming here for the ambiance though. The nurse outfits...the hospital gown dress up...the spankings....the naughty kareoke songs, all made for a good time. Just don't expect much for the food.   The jello shot was a lot of fun as well."}
{"text":"Yuck.  The premise is interesting...but really...is it that hard to make tasty food?  The fries were soggy and practically dripping in oil.  The chili hot dog was gross...the hot dog was super salty and the chili was just revolting.  This place will kill you cuz the food is that disgusting."}
{"text":"*DISCLAIMER: I'm writing this review strictly from a third person point of view.  I did not eat nor attempted to eat anything off the Heart Attack Grill menu.  I did this solely should my friend cannot Yelp this place if he did not survive his meal.*  With that said, I've heard crazy things about the Heart Attack Grill...and nothing on the positive side.  Though it's really up to the individual to come dine here, this place was pretty gimmicky and markets itself on unhealthy eating and radical indulgence.  I considered myself a very healthy eater so when my friend wanted to try out this place, I went along as moral support (and potentially an ambulance caller).  So here we go: my friend weighed himself on the outside scale and coaxed me in.  We were \"greeted\" by this poor and very unhappy hostess that gave us a quick lowdown on how this place operates.  I went along with the campy hospital gown get-up and laughable wrist band.  The place was very empty that night with only two or three other tables that were occupied.  We were seated to the far right of the restaurant and were given menus.  Prior to coming here I decided that I won't be eating anything here but to keep my friend company on his artery-clogging journey.  After a short while this super skinny rather ditzy blonde waitress with the classic Minnie Mouse squeak came over to take the order of a single bypass burger with flatliner fries.    If I were to point out anything positive here, it would be the rather entertaining music videos that were playing on the big screen.  The videos were from the 80's and kindly reminded me of my youth and stupidity.  On other screens, it showed news stories regarding the Heart Attack Grill and even how two people apparently ate themselves sick.  The place seemed proud of this \"achievement\".  While waiting for the food to arrive, I noticed that other patrons were still waiting for theirs.  It was apparent that since it was a slow night, the cook might have decided to gather enough orders to make all the burgers all at once.  People at the other tables did seem restless.  Finally the food arrive and what I saw was a hamburger with oversized buns and a side of very dark dirty looking fries.  I cringed when my friend took his first bite and asked for his opinion.  He replied he had better...which spoke volumes.  The fries themselves looked like they were fried in old reheated lard; very dark and flimsy.  While he ate, I just sat there in my hospital gown hoping nobody I know sees me.  From the 3rd person point of view, the service here was pretty sucky.  Servers were seen gathering at one spot just conversing and joking around with each other.  Our waitress didn't really come over to check on us but just to leave off the bill.  Obviously the customers were not much of their concern.  Just think: I gave up seeing a nudie show for this.  At least my friend survived...and never got spanked."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, great theme. The food is huge and really does make you feel like you might have a heart attack. The quality of the beef on the burger seemed off, maybe just because they're trying to stuff so much fat in there."}
{"text":"What a great experience for the family (yes and that means kids too).   The whole experience from getting your patient gown on, the atmosphere, the menu, etc was awesome and unique.   We did some research before coming here, and our son REALLY wanted us to be served by Lola. What a dream come true that's who we got. Not only was the service from her impeccable, but the food was delicious.   The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars, is you have to pay for bottled water. Considering it is $2.25, you minus well just get a beer for $5.50. lol   We also got to sit right next to the spanking section, which was great entertainment. The experience wouldn't have been the same without LOLA. Don't EVER get rid of her."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try this place, and when I finally did I was so disappointed,  I ordered a shale and boy was it nasty they actually put what I think was lard or butter in the shake and you get a greasy feeling in your mouth. The chili cheese fries even worse they literally taste like cardboard so bland.  The food is definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"If I could give this zero stars I would! Came here because of all the hype about it. Service was terrible, we ordered a bacon cheeseburger asked for the chili on the side & waitress told us we would have to pay extra but it's free on the burger. It made no sense! Sorry but I would not recommend this at all. Save some money & go to Denny's next door."}
{"text":"the food is everything you would expect.  kinda gross, and overpriced.  the big surprise to me was how stark and cold the restaurant is.  it has zero eye appeal.  oh, and they don't have potable water.  if you ask for water, they bring a bottle and charge you for it. finally, and this is more an observation than a critique: the servers aren't hot.  I thought the whole concept was to induce fat guys to buy overpriced, crappy food by hiring busty, stripper quality servers wearing sexy nurse outfits.  I don't see a long lifespan for the heart attack grill."}
{"text":"This is the epitome of a successful restaurant where the focus is on everything but the quality of the food. The food isn't really bad... just bland without much selection.  However, if you come for the experience rather than the noms, you'll be happy. First thing they do is force you into a standard hospital gown, which you have to wear the whole time you are dining.  My bae made the mistake of ordering a burger way larger than he'd expected (based on the photo). Let's just say that he was in a food coma the rest of the night, because if you don't finish your food, you receive a loud, public spanking with wooden board by one of the servers.  I made the mistake of only ordering fries (no veggie burgers) while enjoying one of the wine IVs. I knocked out asleep when we got back to the hotel, as well.  If you know me, you know I love unusual, themed experiences. Even though this place supports damaging your well-being by unhealthy food in excess, it's not like people are going there everyday. It's just a theme to play off of, and Heart Attack Grill has developed it eloquently.   I just adore the spoof on the Last Supper painting where they replaced religious figures with fast food mascots and related characters. So hilarious! There's also a lot of karaoke going on, so prepare your ears (and lungs if you're so inclined) for that!"}
{"text":"5 Star theme restaurant if you don't count the actual food. Our nurse was amazing. The decor was great. The location was great. The parking was easy. The menu was clever. The hospital gowns are a special touch. The spanking is kinda scary, but a unique thing. But the food was pretty gross. I couldn't finish even half of my fries or shake because my tongue rebelled. The chili on my burger tasted a little like dirt, no a lot like dirt, which ruined the burger for me, too.   Not positive or negative, just things you should know: They do NOT give tap water upon request They only accept cash If you don't finish your burger they will spank you (not like your grandma, like a principal from the 1950's)"}
{"text":"The name speaks for itself. After eating my burger I felt like crap afterwards. Overall, food is not that great. If you want to have an experience though, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This was such a cool and fun place.   We had an awesome server who was patient with us and didn't rush us...  The food was good and the drinks too...  Will be back here for sure...  Be in for a fun surprise when you go!!"}
{"text":"Fun place had to try it. The food as you can probably imagine isn't great but the service makes up for it. Lots of spanking going on in this place. Adult beverages served in prescription bottles - wine served in a drip bag oh don't order the lemonade yuck!!! We had fun"}
{"text":"F this place.  Seriously...  Well, maybe not. The staff is really really cool and the chicks in the nurses outfits are hot.  But, seriously... wtf?!?!?!?  I felt so sick after eating at this pit.  I really don't ever want to go back. And really... shame on me. I knew that it would happen.  It is the only solution to a burger and fries cooked in Lard.    I won't go back, but I will tell anyone that is over 350 pounds they will feed you for free in this place. Seriously..  WTF?!?!?!"}
{"text":"The burger wasn't all that it was hyped up to be. Big but not juicy, it was kind of dry and the fries were average. The customer service was good and the environment was cool! I wouldn't go back for a good burger but I'd go back for the experience."}
{"text":"Food was good liked the idea awesome atmosphere and you filled my man"}
{"text":"Absolute trash.  The food was disgusting.  No one in our party even came close to finishing their food (out of disgust).  The burgers are very well done, and there isn't an option for something else.  The milk shake had butter added to it to create a disgusting paste like substance.  Management/ownership clearly terrorizes their waitstaff.  When a member of our party walked in with a coffee the hostess was noticeably fearful for her job and quickly had him throw it away.  I understand not bringing in outside food, and we're fine with throwing it away, but that woman was clearly worried she'd be reprimanded for him walking in with it.  She had the same fear when a member of our party took a gown off the rack to put it on and added that she'll get in trouble if her manager sees.  That's insane.  This place deserves to go out of business for how horrible its food is and how poorly it treats its staff."}
{"text":"Fun, but painful....this food will put a hurtin' on ya.  Took a day for my lips to re-hydrate after the burger and fries, sodium count is insane!  My son's shake also put him out of commission for about 4 hours.    Unique experience.  Cash only"}
{"text":"Excess. Schtick. Zero f***s given. That basically sums up Heart Attack Grill.  On the doorstep of Fremont Street, Heart Attack Grill is everything you've heard and more. The scale out front, eating free if you're over 350lbs, the hospital theme, the spankings if you don't finish your meal. This is Vegas excess at its best and HAG knows it. They admit it. They will gladly take your cash (and it is cash only), thicken your arteries some more and laugh all the way to the bank while doing so.   My friends and I stopped by after doing the SkyJump and were eager to fill our bellies after nearly emptying them several hundred feet in the air. We weighed ourselves for laughs, entered and got geared up in our hospital gowns and took a seat in the sparsely populated restaurant in the optimal pre-lunch rush time. We were seated quickly and given menus, which we flipped through while enjoying the culinary sideshow that HAG has made itself out to be. There isn't a large selection, although what they have comes in some very large sizes, the most infamous of which is their cheeseburger with eight half-pound patties and 40 slices of bacon.Vegetarian options? They openly mock this by calling their cigarettes this. Diet pop and light beer are blasphemy here as well. Our waitress/nurse (nursetress?) was super friendly and sat down with us to give us the run down on the menu and how things worked there, especially that if we didn't finish our food we would be spanked with a paddle. And she would gladly do it. And many people over the course of our meal were; there must have been a dozen just when we were there that marched up to the centre of the restaurant, grabbed a hold of the contraption over which you bend over and are video taped on, and paddled...hard. The videos of your face while being spanked are posted on a website for all the viewing masses of the interwebs. Oh, and you can shell out several dollars to buy the paddle with which you were spanked as well, because why not? Another opportunity for HAG to take your money, you filthy animal. Despite knowing the paddling penalty, I made the unfortunate choice to get a side of onion rings in addition to my single burger, which I got chili and cheese on as well.   It wasn't a long wait, but I wouldn't have known if it was anyway, with everything there is to look at here - the paddlings, the classic movie posters that have been changed to be food/HAG related, the Jello shots being given via plastic penises and over-sized needles. On the wall above the counter, two projectors play clips of HAG making the news, giving the ultimate middle finger to their detractors. Remember those news stories about a couple of guys having heart attacks here? Those will play. Eat up, chubby. Overall, the atmosphere is like a frat, diner and hospital mashed together, but the energy is fun and contagious, as every swing of the paddle brings about cringes and cheers alike.   When our food arrived, it was intimidating. My burger was a single but was still a hefty size and the onion rings were some of the biggest I've ever seen, not to mention that they filled their own basket. No skimpy side order of a few rings here. The burger was one hell of a hot mess; the patty was a little on the dry side but the chili was plentiful and good, if not an amazing example. The onion rings started out good, but thick onion rings tend to be soggier anyway, and when you have a big basket to battle through to avoid getting your ass literally beaten, it got less than enjoyable pretty quickly. Luckily there was a bunch of ranch to help the soggy, greasy rings slide down my gullet until the very last one was gone. Having paddled both of my friends, one for not finishing and the other since it was his birthday, our waitress had been keeping a close eye on me as well, but luckily for me and her  tired shoulder, I did finish my meal.  The food was pretty meh, but Heart Attack Grill is a damned fun spot. They're probably not even trying to have good food. The owner has boldly said that he prays for the day that no one comes in his restaurant because it will mean that America has finally gotten its health together, but until then he'll gladly line his pockets with  the cash of funny loving saps like you and me."}
{"text":"If I can rate this place negative stars I would. We have come here multiple times and never had such a horrible experience. The manager Thalia is so rude and unprofessional . I came here with my family wanting to have a good time laughing and it ended up being the exact opposite. My family and I all ordered a burger and we got 2 basket of fries and chilly fries. The fries were unbearably salty.  We never complain so we washed down the fries with some drinks but the chili cheese fries ordered remained untouched after the initial bite because they were extremely salty. I told the waitress politely that the chilly fries were salty and she told me she could not take it off that we would still get charged for them unless we spoke to her manager. We were more than happy to talk to her manager. The manager Thalia came up to our table with attitude and annoyed about the complaint. Thalia was horrible, and extremely unprofessional I do not understand how a fun place like this can have such a rude and unprofessional manager. She told us that she couldn't take it off the order because the waitress would have to pay it from her own pocket. I then explained to her that it wasn't our fault or our waitress's fault that the chef may have put too much salt on the fries. I then questioned the integrity of her actions and reminded her that what she just said is against labor laws. She then started to hesitate and change her story and started to blame the owner and how they get in trouble. When I told her I was going to report this to the Better Business Bureau she started to get belligerent and cuss. Her words exactly \"I don't give a F**k, you can pay for the entire check. I will have security kick all your asses out of here.\" TBH this is the last and final time we are coming here. It's really a shame and now I know why this place has 3 stars. McDonald's has better customer service and I promise you no manager is going to come out cussing at their guests. It's really embarrassing that someone who's entitled the manager position would speak to a customer disrespectfully. It's even more disappointing that the company is committing ILLEGAL acts. After asking if I can have corporates number the waitress told me there is no corporate number and told me she can give me the owners number, she then went to go speak to the UNPROFESSIONAL RUDE manager Thalia who started laughing and mocking us. Thalia very loudly in front of the entire restaurant then yelled, \" I don't give a shit they are paying for it, I already told them I will call security if they have a problem.\" The chili cheese fries were $6 freaking dollars lol!!! The money wasn't the point, it's her actions, customer service, and the manager's inability to handle herself like a civilized human being. The owner Jon Barrow should be embarrassed to have someone like her taking care of his restaurant and looking after his customers. The atmosphere and the idea is brilliant, if only the manager could get replaced because I don't think training could even fix Thalia. I am embarrassed and in complete shock. Do your self a favor do not come here, especially if you have kids. Unless you want your kids listening to a filthy mouth like Thalia's do not bring your kids here!!!"}
{"text":"It's a novelty. A total tourist destination. The ghastily menu sucked us in. No apologies, pure fat and flavor, nicely done. The decor is a bit cheesy, but this aint the Ritz. The nurses don't fall far from the Hooters prototype and they play their roles nicely enough with big smiles, big hair and big visible bustlines. But, what hasn't made the food shows that I know of, is the practice of paddling the patients that don't finish their \"treatments\". This pushes the cheese factor about three levels beyond Hooters. The paddling is popular (and optional). Helped I'm sure by singleness, or alcohol, it seems to be a means to an end for a lot of patrons....but it totally freaked my wife out. It's loud and distracting and focused in the center of the dining area. It's a bit too white trash for my taste. If it's so popular, put it in the corner or in a special O/R room with observation gallery and have at it.   My burger was quite edible. Well prepared and flavorful. It's not Five Guys or Fuddruckers, nor a memorable burger experience to warrant any serious burger crave. But, there is no challenge to wolf it down and they are quite liberal with the bacon. For it's notoriety, it's a harmless tourist experience that doesn't tie up too much money or time. Not a place to take kids or people with closed minds about what restaurants should be, but a worthwhile visit if you're on Freemont Street."}
{"text":"I am the Las Vegas local that gives all the skinny tourists what they came for...   gotta eat here free before I can't anymore as I am losing weight lol. \"There goes the fat guy\" a la Al Pacino from Scarface!!!  When I walked in overheard someone say \"he's eating for free\" so I turned with a huge smile saying \"Hell yeah I'm eating for free!!\""}
{"text":"This place is alot of fun. They make you wear a hospital gown when you come in. The burgers are huge and tasty with lots of things that are bad for your health. If you are over 350lbs you eat for free. The milkshake we ordered came with a slab of butter on top. If you don't finish eating your burger, one of the hot waitresses takes you up,  bends you over and paddles  you. My wife made me eat all of my food, lol. I wouldn't recommend you eating here more than once a year for your health,  hehe."}
{"text":"When a friend told me about this place, I had reallyyy high hopes. The most caloric burgers? Fries deep-fried in lard?? Extra fattening vanilla milk shakes??? They all sounded soooo delicious and I couldn't wait to try them all. But once I finally did, it wasn't what I expected at all.   It was around 12pm last Sunday.. We all walked in and were immediately greeted by the really friendly hostesses and were given hospital gowns and bracelets to put on. I don't know about you but hospitals totally creep me out! But since it was required, I obediently put on the gown and bracelet and walked in.   The menu here is quite simple. They have 4 types of burgers, from the single bypass to the quadruple bypass, fries, coke, water, milkshakes, and a variety of alcoholic beverages. They even have a jello \"shot\" but that was just too creepy for me. I ended up ordering a single bypass burger with a side of fries and a coke. We waited for a good 15 minutes before the burgers were ready.   Burger: From the outside, it looked pretty good - big, fat, drenched in oil, bacon and chili. I took a few bites and I honestly didn't like the burger at all. The meat had little flavor, dry, and wayyy too oily for me. I know that sounds pretty contradictory.. dry AND oily? How does that work? The burger patty was dry, but the oil was oozing out from the bun, chili and onions surrounding it.. gross! And the whole hospital-like environment didn't help either. It made it sick to me stomach to the point where I had to stop eating. I only had like 1/3 of it.  Fries: I'm a hugeee french-fry person and can normally eat multiple servings of it at other restaurants. That's why bottomless fries are my favorite! But the fries served here limp, greasy, and soggy from the oil when I bit into them.... gross. I had maybe 5 fries and I just had to stop. They didn't even LOOK  appealing - they were all brownish, like they've been left out for a while and not freshly cooked.  I guess the whole hospital thing is what they were going for - even all the staff were dressed up as either nurses or doctors. The restaurant was decorated with hospital props too. But honestly... the ambiance sucked! It was soooo quiet and pretty dead. They had some 90s music videos playing on the big screen but that didn't seen to help at all. The depressing ambience made it seem like I was in an actual hospital.  The only good thing about this place is probably the vodka milk shake. I had a sip of my friend's and it was actually pretty good! Other than that... I'd definitely stay away.   And that article posted by Tiger W... (http://www.ktnv.com/dirtydining/155848485.html) Ohhh my.. You can be sure I'll never set foot here again.  Oh and one more thing... My friend who got the double bypass burger and fries came home and threw up everything he ate.. I'm not sure if it was because of the food or because he was sick... but either way... gross!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE. First they denied access to this lady with a small service dog. That's against the law!!!! Second, the service was garbage. Third, the food was HORRIBLE. My wife ordered the chili cheese fries and only ate two bites. We told the waitress and she threw them away. When we got the bill they were still on there and she told us too bad! Really?! Fine, there goes your tip!! Please save your money and don't eat here. Seriously nasty."}
{"text":"My first visit here and if you are just visiting, definitely go for the Vegas experience.  Everything here screams of not your typical burger joint.  They make an emphasis on making your visit stand out, on top of the burgers that will probably result in a coronary, haha.  First step is to see if you qualify for your free meal by getting on the scale out front and weighing in at 350 lbs.  If you don't make that prerequisite, then you will be part of the paying pool so get your wallets ready.  The minute you step through, one will be required to wear a hospital gown and if you do not finish your burger, you will be spanked with a paddle.  I'm not talking about a plastic ping pong paddle.....this is a wood paddle so for all of you into spanking, this is the place for you.  The main course of this spot are the burgers and they range anywhere from one patty all the way up to ten or more.  You can then choose to load them up even more with cheese and bacon.  The only sides are french fries or onion rings, both deep fried in lard for that extra savory touch.  When I asked for a diet soda, our waitress (who was a doll, btw) gave me the, \"Honey, there is nothing diet here.\"  Milkshakes here have the highest fat content, hahaha.  They also have a 1 lb hot dog on the menu. Don't forget about the jello shots that come in a syringe.  I only purchased the one patty burger with 5 slices of bacon just to avoid the paddling in the event I could not finish my burger or french fries, but since my friend wanted the attention, I asked the waitress to spank him just for the hell of it, to which she obliged HAHAH!  The burgers here are a typical run of the mill burger but with the wait staff in nurse costumes, karaoke, paddling show, and overall \"only in Vegas\" experience, try it.  At least you will have photos of your experience  :D"}
{"text":"Wow, um food was disgusting. When you take a bite of the burger 70% of the taste is grease. The strawberry milkshake w/butter not good at all. The decor of the place looks like you've walked into a Troma movie from the 90's. Very creepy. Theres a large screen above the kitchen playing corny music from the 80's and next to it is a fox news or CNN news report about the people who have died at the heart attack grill. Thats very cold and wrong. Avoid this disaster."}
{"text":"Ever since this place opened up while I was attending ASU, I've always been tempted to try it out. But my recent visit to Phoenix for birthday related festivities, and my new favorite TV show, Man vs. Food, inspired me to step up to the challenge!  My first visit to the Heart Attack Grill, I had to tackle the 8,000 calorie, Quadruple Bypass Burger; in honer of Adam and food challengers everywhere!  First things first, the establishment is a riot! I can't picture people NOT having fun there. The outfits, the blood pressure machine, the margaritas... The atmosphere is incredibly fun.  I had to get an order of their \"Flat-Liner\" Fries... never tasted deep friend lard before. But to be honest, I wasn't impressed. The photo on the menu made them look a lot more appetizing then I felt they were. I've had better for a lot fewer calories... but because you get UNLIMITED Flat-Liner Fries, I'm still satisfied.  But the hamburger... Amazing! One of the best hamburgers I've tasted! Despite the size of this 2 lb. beast, I was able to wrap my jaws around it and take some full bites. Delicious! Cheese drips everywhere and flavor just explodes in your mouth.  I was victorious with the challenge, despite being slow with time (took me 25 minutes... I heard the record is 1 min. 47 sec.). It definitely was a challenge. The first 10 minutes were cheese burger heaven. But by the end of the meal I was tired of eating, changing the flavor of hamburger with the occasional tomato or pickle (also, an excellent condiment bar to build your burger how ever you like it). But I persevered, and I was happily removed from the building by my sexy waitress Nurse Mary in a wheel chair.  A thanks goes out to my friend Amberly who joined me and gave me support when I was slowing down. Her optimism definitely helped me finish this race.  Next time, I will definitely order a smaller burger..."}
{"text":"So I heard so much about this place and been dying to eat and drink here. I weighed myself and came in they place a hosptial gown on me and I asked for a picture. I sat at the bar and order a Jell-O shot in a syringe. It was tasty and I spoke to my waiter nurse Rikki she told me about the business and how it has almost been shut down. I find this place fun and so Vegas."}
{"text":"This place was very entertaining. From the menu to the people being spanked for not eating all their food. I loved the sign that said if you weigh 350 pounds you eat for free.   The wine comes out in an IV bag, now that's classic. If you get that make sure to share with someone. One bag equals a bottle.   The food was okay. Nothing special about the burger and fries. We had better.   Our server was great. She made sure we comfortable. Thanks Jessica."}
{"text":"We went to Fremont Street and decided to eat here for the experience. It's a good thing we weren't there for the food. The whole nurse/hospital gown thing was kind of cute, but the food was horrid. Burgers tasted charred, not grilled. No one in our group ate the fries after trying one or two. They were soggy and tasteless. Blech!   All in all, cute theme, bad food."}
{"text":"I went to Heart Attack Grill after seeing it in the national nursing media headlines (they were putting this place down for creating a demeaning/sexualized view of nurses). So, of course, I had to go and see what the fuss was about.   I walked in to the very small location, to find only 2 other tables with customers (older, unhygienic, obese men). The two waitresses on staff were less than appealing (and I'm the kind of girl that can look at an attractive woman and admit it) and the \"cook\" behind the counter, in the scrubs/doctor uniform looked like his clothes and hair hadn't been washed in more than a week.   Went ahead and ordered anyways. Their menu consists of 4 burgers (single, double, tripple, or quadruple bypass bugers), flatliner fries, and soda... but no diet soda. Oh, you can also order a pack of Camel filterless cigarettes if your stash is running low. I ordered a single bypass burger, flatliner fries, and a coke. The burger was sub-par... very greasy and the fries were soggy and half cooked. The only positive thing I have to say is that I enjoyed drinking a Coke out of a cold glass bottle.   I'd rather go to Hooters to see hot, half-dressed chicks... and I'd rather go ummmmm... ANYWHERE else to eat."}
{"text":"We had been really excited to try Heart Attack Grill ever since seeing it featured on some Travel Channel show in 2010 some time. So when we learned that Heart Attack Grill was opening in Vegas on Fremont street, it was ON!  Flash forward to this past weekend. We stayed in Las Vegas and decided to make a trip to Heart Attack Grill for Christmas Eve dinner. Not your typical dining choice for one of the most special nights of the year; then again, Vegas isn't exactly the first destination folks think of for the holiday, either. So... It was par for the course!  Our journey down Fremont Street was one of excitement and anticipation. We were finally on our way to bad food ground zero! When we arrived, we took pictures of the front of the restaurant, including he parked ambulance in the front; funny stuff so far.   Inside, we were greeted by a \"nurse\" who didn't even bother standing up from her seat behind the counter until we made it clear we wanted to eat. Weird.   The restaurant was very empty. A few families were there, but it felt very cold and odd. To give them the benefit of the doubt, it WAS Christmas Eve. However, the design and execution of the place just isn't welcoming or even amusing. It's bad. An empty bar and walls filled with huge monitors that were so dim, they'd have looked better turned off. '80s music played along with their music videos on one wall. I guess that means the '80s were the flashpoint of shitty, greasy food. Or not. Who knows? Or cares.   Our waitress was a nice gal, and we thanked her for working on Christmas Eve. However, a nice server doesn't make a crap restaurant much better than it is.   Food ordered included a Single Bypass with lard-fried fries and a bottle of Coke. Bottle of Coke = no refills, and The Heart Attack Grill does NOT serve water unless you want to BUY a bottle.   The fries we envisioned were golden and crispy, like McDonald's back in the day. Heaven, right? Wrong. They were limp and soggy, fried with their skins on. Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.   The burgers were OKAY. Nothing great. It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger. The cheese slices were sandwich slices, the crease from the individual plastic wrapper impression could still be seen. Classy.   Finally, the dessert of choice was a butter fat milkshake, vanilla, with an entire bar of butter blended into it for good measure. We shared and ate with spoons because the consistency is more like ice cream than a shake. And so... about half way, we decided that the taste of butter really overpowered the vanilla. That wasn't a good thing. When I finally put my finger on it and said, \"This tastes EXACTLY like a Buttered Popcorn Jelly  Belly,\" that signaled the end. Because that IS what they taste like. Gross. Not even sweet. Just gross.   The bill came to $30 for the two of us. Heart Attack Grill doesn't take cards, only cash. I thought the cheap-ass Asian places in Alhambra were the only ones that pulled that crap these days. But anyway.  We paid and walked out feeling like we'd been had. The waitress was fine and friendly, but the others (including a guy dressed like a doctor) walked around the place NOT interacting with guests, NOT making jokes or being lively. They just walked back and forth like zombies; the perfect environment to be wild, rude and crude. But no - total ambience fail.   I honestly don't think Heart Attack Grill will survive very long in Vegas. There are too many dining choices. Especially when there is NO feeling of experience of even humor when you eat at the Grill. Just zombies taking your order with iPhones and hurrying back to doing nothing (or in the case of the hostess, sitting on her ass).   What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us. To say we were let down is an understatement. I'd never recommend this place to anyone. The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant."}
{"text":"Gimmicks scare me so it took my 4th trip to Vegas to really give this place a shot. If you are going to have a good time you should really try to get into the spirit of the place. It is cash only, but they do have an ATM on site. We didn't need it, but from what they told us it was only 75 cents. So there is that.   When you walk in they lay out the rules... In that you have to pay cash, wear a hospital gown, and finish your food.   The menu is all \"bad\" for you, but it was all very delicious. The burger patties are 1/2 pound use that as your gauge of how much you can eat. If you don't finish your burger the sweet nurses will paddle you for it. So be good and eat up!!! Jello shot syringes are a must, also why not get a pill bottle of alcohol. It is a fun souvenir to have. The burgers all come with chili, without the beans, and they are delicious.   It was definitely a good experience all around. I recommend at least one trip to this place!!!   Tip: If you weigh 350 lbs + you eat for free."}
{"text":"It's the sorry ass place on Fremont street.  They won't let drunks in...its Vegas!!!! What are you suppose to be!!!! It VEGAS!!!"}
{"text":"The burger was bland as were the fries.  The only thing this place has going for it is the gimmick."}
{"text":"hi do not waste your time or money on this place, its not worth it! gross and cost a lot if you do go split a hot dog with some one and an order of fries hot dog was big enough for 3 people and fries for 2, the chill seemed as it came from a can and the cheese was a slice just sitting on it hardly melted, cash only place and only cheese burgers or hot dogs no chicken, and cash only a little dirty too, good luck if you go."}
{"text":"Finally got to experience the Heart Attack last night.  The experience is definitely over-the-top. Hospital gowns for all. Spankings (paddlings) delivered by nurses, leaving splinters ending up in the seat of your pants. The scale sounding off when a 350+ pound person weighs in. Jello shots in giant syringes. And, of course, the notorious menu.  I have to start off by saying that the fries (~$2) did not impress me. They're just too soft overall, not very crunchy at all, and somewhat awkwardly sized between shoestring and full-on steak fries.  I tried a bit of my friend's alcoholic apple pie shake. Tasted just like advertised! If you wanna try a delicious drink (note: pay attention to your stomach capacity), get this or another flavor.  The burger was easily the best part. I had the single bypass (~$7) with the bacon option (~$1). If you somehow have a giant stomach, then the double bypass and above burgers are great values. I also saw a lot of the girls sharing a single. The burger was pretty juicy, the red onions were great (not if if on their own merit or if covered with lard), and the bacon had just the right crunch for me.  Definitely check this place out if you're on Fremont Street. For what's essentially a tourist trap, the prices are not bad at all, the flavors are solid, and the experience is to die for..."}
{"text":"They have a weight scale outside. People over 350 lbs eat for free. Everyone inside wears a hospital gown which is hilarious."}
{"text":"Ugh, not recommended. Terrible ingredients and terrible drinks.  Definately do not recommend on any level."}
{"text":"Chili dog okay. Should be a warning not to take your little ones there. People at the next table deep throating a fake penis. Not good"}
{"text":"Service excellent. Food excellent. Atmosphere ultra entertaining. Vegas at its best. The spankings are hilarious. Karaoke is dope."}
{"text":"Omg I'm having a heart attack! This place is awesome!!!!! The food is soooooo good and the concept is priceless. Put that together with hilarious menu and a spanking of people who don't finish their meals and you have a meal and a show! Loved it!"}
{"text":"This place is actually pretty cool!  They suit you up with a hospital gown and the waitresses are dressed as nurses! The food is definitely quite scary just because it so damn bad for you! I mean they put a piece of butter over their milkshake.. Intense!  The coolest part was that I got a spanking for my birthday! It hurt but my family got a good laugh out of it.  The burger was decent, just a little greasy."}
{"text":"Oh brother! This was a wonderful experience. Being a tourist or living out in Vegas, you will hear about this restaurant a fare amount. They had also had opened up another location further down the strip; Unfortunately it was later closed and removed. My first altercation with the grill was late this evening. I ordered a double bypass, fries, and a strawberry shake to go. Gracefully they honored my take out request. Unfortunately, I didn't receive/experience any \"In-House\" spanking for not finishing my entree. The ease of eating this monster in the comfort of my own home helped beat the endearment of the local entertainment. I was informed that they will only be able to accept cash, they have ATM's nearby. The butter milk shake was delicious and very rich. The lard was fulfilling. The fries were okay. Now, in the safe of my own home I will sadly inform you that \" I'm full!\""}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come from Reno and came here from a tip from a friend and it was a rather weird but fulfilling experience. I got the single and he got the quadruple. The burger was good and hit the right spots. Our server was Sasha and she was so nice! My boyfriend couldn't eat more though. If you can't finish it they do give you three good spankings! Only four stars cause some of the things they do are sort of inappropriate and they allow children to see it. But overall good food and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I am going to add a star to my previous review from a few months ago.  I have indeed returned to Heart Attack Grill with visitors from out of town as I said I may in my first review.  The burger was good again. I passed on the fries this time.  What gives this place a boost this time around is the event I witnessed on my second visit.  This is not in reference to the patient who had an actual heart attack while dining.  To give that an extra star would be cruel and sick on my part.  No, my extra star comes on the wings of a public spanking of two patients by a rather sultry nurse.  These two finished, on their own, a burger larger than a single bypass burger.  One finished a double.  The other, a triple.  In response they were required to remove their wallet from the back pocket, bend over a chair and receive three spanks asking \"Please nurse, may I have another\" in between each.  This caught the attention of not only the other diners but the people walking outside as well.  It was quite funny. Not to mention entertaining.  I hate to sound deranged by saying that public humiliation is something to be admired but this is Las Vegas.  Heart Attack Grill is bringing the \"sin\" back to Sin City."}
{"text":"I had the lard shake here, after drinking the whole thing I am pretty sure I shaved off a couple months of my life. Apparently if the shake was any more creamier it would just turn into straight lard, all my friends were pretty disgusted with me finishing the thing but it tasted pretty good for the first half sip and I only did it because I was raised to clear my plate.  The burgers here are extra unhealthy and that's this place's draw, people who just want to eat like crap and don't give a damn. Pretty sure the burger shaved off a couple months of my life too.   The waitresses kind of act like they don't want to work there, and the place has a dragged down feel to it, at least in the day time.   I kindda liked the novelty of this place, and how it says that if you weigh over 650 lbs or so you eat for free, although I've read in the news that several of the people who were eating for free here died very early. Not to insult their memory but it's a lifestyle choice and if they respected it themselves, I respect that.  Outside they have a buncha warning signs saying that this place could kill you, which I thought was funny.  If I ever come back here and any of the people in my company would like to try it out against my recommendation, I'd probably buy the biggest burger, the quadruple bypass burger I believe, I'd scarf down that monster just to show that I can do it unphased.  That or maybe after scarfing it down I end up in the hospital- a story to tell nevertheless."}
{"text":"First and foremost this is my first review and I cant believe how absolutely appalled I am.  But, here it goes.....So my wife and I are in town for a family emergency and decided to have lunch because we had a lil time on our hands. We drove past HAG on LV blvd and it caught my eye because of the name and I love a great burger. Upon entering I was excited and looking forward to it the place seems almost like a Hooters but for Burgers. The smock thing they have you wear when you come in is cool and gimmicky for the place but it didnt sit well with me to wear items that others have wore before but I figured hey WTH the waitress we had was very personable and  nice but was new. the prices were very high for such a simple menu. My wife ordered the smallest burger and fries and I was talked into the Quad bypass burger. with like 20 strips of bacon! I asked our waitress if the restaurant offered military discount as I often do when I am on a budget and travelling. She said \"Let me ask\" upon returning she said \"No sorry\" I was thanked her for asking. Either way I though it was a good time to have lunch with the wife and a new place so I was looking forward to the food regardless. At this point I was very excited and amused on the place and was talking to my wife about how this place should/would be a goldmine. They offered malt liquor (Strange in a restaurant)in a can I ordered a Tecate she a sugar Coke. Now for the twist of events..... Our food arrived in less than 10 minutes which is great but I was skeptical, The Burger was massive and looked so good but it was warm to the touch at best I had approx 3 bites and noticed the bacon looked as if had been microwaved from being cooked days ago and was the same a spaghetti in consistency-(Gross) The cheese was not melted, The fries looked like they were cooked in old oil due to the almost black color in nature. I tried my hardest to stomach this but I couldnt. I proceeded to flag down my waitress and ask her if this was old vice cooked to order at first she replied yes and then said something that made me raise an eyebrow, she began on informing me and my wife that she wouldnt doubt if the food was old because of the way the owner is. I asked her to elaborate and she said he is so cheap that he makes his staff count each napkin and plastic cup everyday in order to cut costs. She also informed me she almost walked out her second day on the job because of what he acts like in his day to day operations. She looked excited when I asked to speak to him about the quality and preparation of my food. When the Owner/manager Jon came to the table he sat down opposite from me and was very hostile. At this point I was pretty much amazed I would assume he would address my concerns in a professional and couteous manner vice an attempt at intimidation and apprehension. I said I would please like another burger due to the dissatisfaction of it not being fresh. He looks at myself and my wife and says' \" In six years I have never comped a meal and it won't be today!!\" I proceeded to inform him I simply wanted another burger and I am not looking for a comp. He then informed us that he would call the police if we didnt pay I said I would not pay for a burger like this especially one that i didnt touch. From his demeanor at this point I wanted to leave so i said look I will pay for my wifes and her drink and the beer i did not even drink but i will not pay for this quality of food. At this point I felt threatened and was basically being held against my own will. I said fine Please call the police. He proceeds to lean over and say, You know what \" you started it when you asked for a discount\" I was like \"What\"? He then says I cant stand the \"F\" ing military I was so appalled that he was addressing me like this in general and then he begins to say, I'm from Oxnard, Ca. and we used to beat the \"S\" out of filthy mexicans like you! At this point myself and my wife are in utter disbelief He leaves and the table next to me were also expressing there disgust in the food and as he saw us speaking with them he said to leave right now we were trespassing! As I leave I attempt to tip my waitress and he rips the money from my hand! My wife and I wait outside for the police THE WHOLE TIME WE are waiting quietly the owner is harrassing us going on a tirade about my race and my occupation being totally distasteful in front of my wife around 15 min later the show up (LVPD) I provide them ID and they are in absolute disbelief they resolve the issue after questioning and bottom line it does not matter the police officer said I had to pay I totally understand and uphold the law but requested that I receive what I pay for (At least I gave it away to a homeless man. BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT: 1. DO NOT GO THERE FOR QUALITY OR FRESHNESS  IT LOOKS GOOD BUT IS NOT 2. THE OWNER IS A DISGUSTING HUMAN BEING. 3.YOU ARE WARNED. PLEASE DONT BE ROBBED OR DEGRADED LIKE ME  GO ANYWHERE ELSE."}
{"text":"Don't eat here if you're on a diet! I'm not, so I had to check it out..food was good, and luckily my boyfriend and I finished our food!!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere,  ok burgers. Ya gotta go just for the experience! You can get a really big burger here,  but bigger is not always better. The burgers are kinda basic except for the bacon and chili.  I have never had chili on a burger before and it did add to this burger. The bacon slices are not big,  so don't let the 5 slices of bacon per patty scare you.  The atmosphere is Frat-boy fun and if you don't finish your burger you will get spanking.  Nurse Ashley doesn't mess around!"}
{"text":"Just like mom used to say, \"Finish your meal,....or else\" your nurse will administer spankings! I love America."}
{"text":"Food was pretty average in my opinion. The atmosphere was unique with the hospital gowns, nurses as waitress etc. If you think you'd like it after reading the reviews then totally try it."}
{"text":"The food is disgusting!! Cool theme and fits the Vegas atmosphere with having over sized burgers but they are gross. Came here with a group of friends and hated the food. It had absolutely no taste! I got a chilly burger with bacon and I couldn't taste any of it. It was gross!! I honestly don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Bueno sitio, las hamburguesas y comida en general muy buena y las camareras muy simpáticas y amables. Un lugar donde el colesterol y las grasas están muy presentes y donde pasas un buen rato e incluso te diviertes con la temática del pijama  que te ponen nada mas entrar y ver como le pegan con la paleta a mas de uno ( advierto que dan bastante fuerte por lo que vi ajjaja). Resaltar que solo aceptan efectivo nada de tarjeta."}
{"text":"I lived right across the street and feel obligated to try anything new downtown.  My boyfriend's daughter was in town so we though it would be a fun place to try.  Maybe they are just settling in at the moment.  His daughter thought the shake was gross which i have to concur, it wasn't sweet at all.  We got the biggest of the burgers just to go all out and were disappointed with the quality of that as well.  However, when we ordered \"shots\" of Jager they came in glasses and were probably equal to about 3 shots.  So if you order a drink be ready for a hang over.  Overall we wanted to give the experience a try, but we likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Heart Attack Grill.  This place is pure marketing genius.  If you're reading this review, and you're thinking about going here, either (A)  You're looking for entertainment value, or (B) You have a death wish.    If it's (A), you won't be disappointed, it's fun.  Staff dressed up as Doctors and Nurses (naughty nurses that adminster shots), entertaining menu's, mandatory hospital gowns, parody posters on the walls, they even produced their own video news clips.  Marketing guys get 5 stars.  If it's (B), IMO it would take quite a few Quadruple Bypass burgers to off yourself.  Just my opinion, your experience may vary.  I had the Quadruple Bypass, and other than a mild food coma, experienced no ill effects.  The food is OK.  Burger was good, and the bacon was excellent.  The fries?  Well, let's just say there's a reason fries aren't typically fried in lard.  My wife ordered the fries and didn't even finish them.  My pet peeves:  they won't serve you tap water, you have to purchase bottled water.  If you ask for water, they'll just bring you a bottle of water.  Boo.  Pet peeve #2:  they won't let you split a burger.  Naturally, everyone wants the Quadruple Bypass Burger, 'cuz it's the bomb.   Just let people split it and charge a split fee.  I didn't really want to eat that, but I did.  Just to get the full experience.   Judged strictly on quality of food, this place is two stars.  Judged on entertainment value, it's four stars.  Am I glad I went?  You betcha.  Would I go again?  Probably not.  If a bunch of friends were going, would I come along?  Sure."}
{"text":"This place is mostly show for the tourists, but the food is pretty darn good. As we came in the helpful staff helped us into our hospital gowns and brought us to our table. We were there about 11:00am in a weekday and it was quiet. The servers took advantage of that and really worked each table well.   The food arrived quickly, I had a double bypass and it was delicious. One of the best burgers in town. The fries are good too. When the food landed in front of me it smelled so good I devoured it without getting a picture! If your blood vessels are flowing too cleanly or you need a few thousand calories, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Very good burgers.  Menu is only burgers, fries, milkshakes (alcoholic & virgin,) and fries. You walk in and they put a hospital gown on all diners.  Fries are not so good.  Oh yeah if you weigh over 3 and a half spins on the scale you eat for free.  Cash only."}
{"text":"Come for the experience, not for the lard-saturated burgers and fries (unless you're over 350 lbs. and your meal is on the house).  Upon checking into the Heart Attack Grill, nurses slap a wristband and cotton gown on you before escorting you to the cafeteria, where all the other patients are dining.   The bf and I shared the single bypass burger + 5 strips of bacon (+ $1) (we can't share the double, triple, or quadruple), but ordered our own drinks. His choco milkshake had a piece of butter swimming in it, I had a Mexican coke in a glass bottle. The burger was bland and dry... luckily the bacon saved the flavor for me to finish my half of the burger. The fries were just as dull in flavor. For food cooked in lard, one would think there would be more taste... after all, we're splurging on the calories already... may as well make it savory!  A cheap meal that can only be forked out in ca$h, but if you forget, don't fret, because the ATM in the restaurant charges a mere $0.75 service fee (unheard of and practically free in Vegas!)   The meal was entertaining and all the patients were in high spirits, completely unlike a true hospital cafeteria. I would not return for their outrageously unhealthy and tasteless food, but this is a fun tourist trap for daredevils to try :) (those who finish the quadruple bypass get rolled out in a wheelchair)"}
{"text":"It was just okay and I'm sorry I'm saying that but I really expected more taste-wise  Menu is small with just burgers fries and hot dogs and onion rings which is awesome. Staff is friendly and set up is great Music videos playing which show the staff green screened into the videos which was funny. The burger was okay kind of tasteless for being cooked in lard... The fries were awesome and so were the onion rings. It's a fun place to eat though and it was packed so they are doing something right"}
{"text":"Great burgers great time and a wonderful experience. One again I ordered big and the waitress said \"I think I'm going to be spanking somebody\". Appearantly if you don't Finish your burger you get hit with a paddle. Now I ordered a 7 x 7 with everything and chile, got a little worried, but just ate my way past that. And yup, I finished it. It made it easy because it was delicious. My wife and kids always order their shakes because they're great. If in Vegas definitely a picture moment. Get some!!!"}
{"text":"After seeing this restaurant on the news I was very excited to try it. However, once we actually got there and ordered a burger and fries, I was grossed out. The burger had no flavor and looked and tasted like a hockey puck. The meat was so over cooked, dry and one of the worst hamburgers I've ever eaten in my life. The fries were good, but not good enough to give this review anymore points. It's been three days since eating there and I still have a bad taste in my mouth. When I said something to the waitress, she just shrugged her shoulders and walked away. I couldn't have gotten out of their faster. Every one of us at the table couldn't even finish our over-done burger. This restaurant is a total tourist trap and they could care less if they get repeat business. Buyer Beware, spend your money somewhere else. As much as I hate fast food burgers, it would have been a happy substitute than this crap. I'm very disappointment in myself for buying into this hype."}
{"text":"I have to try everything and with this branch, Claudine,who was serving us, accommodate us professionally"}
{"text":"This place is FUN!!!! I felt happier in here than at Disneyland, I don't know why. Basically, you've got to finish your food or you'll get bum paddled by a nurse. It was my birthday and I don't eat much... I knew what was coming to me. Luckily, the doctor was in and he was easy on me! Six medium paddles instead of three hard ones. Ohhh wait. I forgot this is a restaurant. THE FOOD!!! Yes, that was yum yum but I logged my food on MyFitnessPal later like a fitjunkie forgetting it's a vacation, and WOW. THOUSANDS OF CALORIES. Now I get the name. Anyway, fun as hell. My besties and I loved it."}
{"text":"I was refused service because I had a service animal, a tiny Pomeranian who is clearly marked as a service animal.  Absolutely unacceptable.  Will only go back to tell them \"Enjoy your crappy yelp review.  I think my disability attorney would enjoy playing with this."}
{"text":"This place is certainly unique and I'm glad we got to experience it while visiting Las Vegas. Upon entering , you are greeted by one of the waitress (nurses) and asked to put on a hospital gown. The menu is pretty simple, you can either get a big burger or a really really big burger. I ordered the single burger with a side of fries. I would think that because that's all they really sell there that it would be a really good burger. This was easily one of the worst burgers I have ever eaten. The patty was super dry and there was bits of cartilage/bone in the meat. Gross. This was the first time I didn't finish a burger. So with that being said, I really like the atmosphere and the concept of the restaurant. It was a fun place to visit. However, if your hungry and looking for a good or even decent meal, then look elsewhere."}
{"text":"So my review is not based on the food, as I am a vegetarian and there is NOTHING here I can eat.  However, I have accompanied people here to watch them eat the quadruple bypass burger, which is probably one of the most disturbing things you can watch a human do to themselves, but it is oddly fascinating, too.  The last time I went, I was with two Europeans (German and French) who both tackled the quadruple bypass burger.  Nurse Stephanie served us and she really got into the shtick of the place, and was also really friendly.  The Europeans really enjoyed it, and it was a fun way to end their Vegas experience.  I didn't realize it until later, but the Europeans (who are not used to American tipping) only left a 10% gratuity.  I hope Nurse Stephanie sees this and knows that they really did have a good time, they just didn't know any better.  And in case you're curious, the French guy was able to finish the entire quadruple bypass burger (including the very greasy bacon).  The German finished half, and took the rest for later."}
{"text":"The burgers were good, the fries were ok, the strawberry shake was great, and the ambiance was fun. The prices were surprisingly reasonable, service was quick and everyone around us seemed to be having a good time. Check it out."}
{"text":"I went back to Vegas last week for the 2nd time n I had to come back to Heart Attack Grill! The atmosphere is great the staff is so nice and will take pics with you as well as for you! This time I was spanked for not completing my meal and I liked it! kmsl The food is so damn good every time I go to Vegas I will eat there..... You have to get into the theme n wear a hospital gown It's a must you go for the food and the experience!"}
{"text":"Man this place was awesome!!!! And fun too, I had the single burger, friends had the triple, the burger were delicious and the fries were off the chain!!!, I will go back next time when I go back to vegas zoo woo!!!!"}
{"text":"Went in for an early dinner was my first time here liked the idea of the theme but the place seemed old run down then out of no where they make you get up to do chicken dance burger patties are thick lol and they do spank you if you don't finish your meal food was alright the girls outfits all look way too small hella tight it is a cash place only first issue ran into the second we walked in they dress you in your hospital gown I completely get it participate with the theme but how you going to try make a 2 year old wear a grown person gown if there going to make everyone participate at least have children gowns as well they have TVs all over playing old outdated songs waitress sing karaoke pretty lame there trying way too hard to be good it just comes out tacky"}
{"text":"Go to In N Out Burger instead. The food tast way better and is much cheaper!!"}
{"text":"I loveddddd this place, this restaurant themed restaurant is not only fun, but also very unique. The food is excellent and every detail is very well thought out.   When you first walk in the host places a hospital gown on you and a hospital admission wrist band. All around the restaurant the hospital theme is reflected. The servers are all dressed as nurses and I also saw a doctor somewhere.   We ordered a regular burger and the quadruple bypass. The burgers were amazing. Juicy and tasty. The fries were crispy and just perfectly salty. You cannot order diet coke since this is an \"unhealthy\" place but the coke comes in this really cute bottle.   There is also a huge scale outside that you can weigh yourself on going in and out of the restaurant. Also you cannot use a credit card bc if you do have a heart attack while eating then your bill will left unpaid haha. Anyways this was a great experience and if this place would not make my cholesterol sky rocket and my arteries clog, then I would go back every time I visit Vegas. It's a must try if you are traveling through Vegas."}
{"text":"First off this is CASH ONLY! They will tell you at the door... I never laughed so hard in my life... You get a show on the stage... You wear a hospital gown and you get your wine in a IV bag.. You better eat your food or you will be spanked..... Or you can always volunteer someone from your table to be spanked.... We did and OMG so funny.....The place is fun... The food is so greasy and full of fat but FUN,,,, FUN,,, Fun......"}
{"text":"I was a bit creeped out the first time I ate here. I took my wife's younger brothers because they had seen it on the Travel Channel, so I thought I'd try it out. Being a large man, I got to eat for free (score!), but only had one single and some fries, but enjoyed watching my teenage brother-in-laws try to finish their doubles (haha). I've been back several times with mixed experiences. It really depends on your nurse: sometimes you get a nurse who is very talkative and makes sure your order comes out real fast and hot, and sometimes you get a nurse who is watching the clock. It's not the best hamburger I've ever had, but I enjoy the do-it-yourself condiments (jalapeno and mustard for me), and the fact that you know you are going to get CHEESE and BEEF, and in good portions. The fries are tasty, but inconsistent. Sometimes they're crispy and tasty, sometimes they're flat and soggy. I guess they could work on consistency."}
{"text":"Burgers done one way and one way only. Extremely WELL done and dry as a bone is the only way there allowed to serve them. NO lettuce. NO pickles. NO raw onions. American cheese is the only option. Your only allowed to split the basic 1/2 lb burger. Canned beer only and your not allowed a glass or a cup. Only regular soda available. They don't have silverware either. No credit cards. Cash only. So many rules at this place i couldn't wait to get out of there."}
{"text":"All of the food here is alright good - like a little bit better version of Tommy's. What makes this place attractive is the experience. It starts off with a scale outside the front door to weigh yourself; you know what kind of food you're getting into. Right when you enter, they put you in a hospital gown and tag you a with medical wrist band. Heart Attack has a Quentin Tarantino type twist to a medical facility, but with a food emphasis theme. There are nice artwork everywhere that changes famous pics to their own food version (look at some of the photos that people have taken). The waitresses dress up as hot nurses and the guy behind the bar, looks like a doctor. Alcoholic shots come in prescription bottles. Portions here are huge! They have up to a Octuple Bypass Burger (8 X 1/2 lbs beef paties, lettuce, red onions, cheese, gourmet sauce, tomato, and 40 bacon slices optional). Chili dog tastes like the chili burger except with a big hot dog meat of course. Fries are deep fried and lard and just taste greasy; chili fries are even more greasy. They even put a slice of butter in your shakes. Be careful what you order though because if you don't finish your food, they will spank you! No sharing allow except for the smallest level items and they will hit you really hard with a wooden paddle, 3 times :/. Being \"elite\", of course I finished my burger/hotdog ;). A girl yelled out for her mommy, a guy ran and almost cried after being spanked. Overall, a fun place to visit and check out when in Vegas."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here.  I liked the friendly staff, the medical theme where they dress you in hospital gowns and the waitresses are dressed like nurses, down to the good food and the spanking with the PADDLE if you didn't finish all of your food from your sexy nurse.   I may have left food on my plate on purpose!  OK, I admit I did and will do it again.  Spank me, I am naughty!   LOL"}
{"text":"Such a fun experience. The food was good,, and super filling. Was a highlight to our Vegas experience. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere the food was pretty good not like Gordon Ramsey burger good but good old fashioned home cooked burger good. Chili fries were yummy as well. Such a fun atmosphere def worth the experience :)"}
{"text":"We went there on a Sunday morning in June.  Had seen it on TV before.  Were not disappointed with the real thing.  Friendly young ladies who looked good in their uniforms. Good service. Burgers weren't bad. The have a large condiment bar where you can add good things like tomatoes, pickles, onions, jalapenos. Just can't understand why they don't have milkshakes  -- wouldn't milkshakes be more conducive to heart attacks than Coke?  They also have beer and wine.   We would visit again if we ever get back to the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Visiting home during Christmas break and we decided to hit Heart Attack Grill.. well let me tell you how disappointed we were in the hamburgers. You get a better tasting burger from Carl's Jr or In N Out.   First of all NO FLAVOR what so ever, burger not cooked, they say lettuce isn't healthy but they offer tomatoes and onions. They use a poor quality meat, but the bun was good. Their onions rings were the best part of the meal.  The waitress was very friendly and took my burger off the bill because it wasn't cooked. We won't be back and won't recommend this place to our local friends or family"}
{"text":"Resize the dominatrix trying to spank me for not completing my hamber the food was absolutely amazing and extremely plentiful I found it very cool that they give you any shots in a medicine bottle. The place is extremely clean and very fun  to be in. So stop in and enjoy either a lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I agree with what so many others have said....the food is \"meh.\"   I dined at the restaurant today and the food was ok but after finishing my meal I removed my gown as it was getting uncomfortable. I was approached by the hostess and told if I didn't put my gown back on (yes I was wearing decent, normal clothing underneath) I would have to leave the restaurant \"because the owner was there.\" I was planning on ordering additional food/drink but after being told what I HAD to wear I immediately asked for the check. The hostess was apologetic saying she had to tell me to do so \"because the owner was there\" but I have no desire to dine at a place who decides what I will wear and gives their employees a mind set of having to ask for me to do something that even caused them embarassment. THUMBS DOWN! :(  Also, waitress takes your order on I PHONE. Thought she was texting the whole time I was ordering.  Previous reviews I COMPLETELY agree with:  Melissa G said: \"The fries made me want to vomit...they are cooked in lard. They only serve coke, water & alcohol.   Bypasses stop at the window and take photos of you eating...it was rather disturbing.\" YES! And they CHARGE you for water!  Jessica T. said: \"The tables have full rolls of paper towels, and bottles of ketchup, mayo, and mustard.\" YES, but dirty paper towel rolls with other persons goop on them from grabbing the roll and dirty condiment bottles complete with fingers prints of the previous diner due to the hamburger buns. EWW.   Virgil R. said: \"The burger was a very thin patty cooked way past well done and could have been used as a hockey puck. I like my burgers thick and juicy so this was highly disappointing; the bacon was left on the grill about 5 minutes too long as well and the burnt texture really distracted from the rest of the burger.\" YES! My hubby took off 3 of the 5 pieces of bacon. \"the condiments on the table (mayo kept at room temp is scary)..YES! WHAT IS IN THAT UNREFRIDGERATED Bottle?"}
{"text":"First...they wont take a credit card.  That alone will keep me from going back.    Second...very poor service.  The waitress took our order and never came back.  I had to walk up to the front just to ask for the ticket so that I could pay.  They sent me back to my table and told me to wait for the [absent] waitress to bring me the check.  I also was not brought my entire order.  They went back to the kitchen to get the rest but never returned.    Third...the options were dismal even though the portions were large.  They have no pickles for burgers, no BBQ sauce, and no cheese (unless you call American \"cheese\"..I dont).  The meat patty was overcooked and dry.  The fries were newly made yet still soggy in an unpleasant way.  I must say that the top of the bun was delicious and well toasted.  Unfortunately the bottom of the bun was very soggy.    While the gimmicky decoration and medical theme was cute....it was definitely not worth going back for and not at all worth the price of the meal."}
{"text":"I have been to both locations you know were Putsy's use to be now that place was the best place I sure do miss Putsy's ... But back to the review in my mind I go to a place to eat good food and this was not what I had in mind... You enter the place to be taken over by some Halloween nurse to band you and gown you... The fries are good and keep in mind it's endless so eat up the burger was so greasy they dip the buns in butter... I was like wow I had to use 35 napkins it was a good meal but... I think I will be back when I am 50 and have no interaction with Halloween nurses that seems like that right time."}
{"text":"I wanted the QUAD! yet, I wanted bacon as well, and didn't think I'd polish it off. I hate wasting food. So I received the TRIPLE with BACON. IT WAS DELICIOUS! AND the price is GREAT!  Too a bit to consume it.  Two asian guys sat next to us, one guy got a QUAD and one a double, they both received their burgers after us and consumed them before us! crazy.  love the wrist bands and the patient gowns. If you cannot make it to your car after consumption, they will drive you to your car. I wonder if they would have driven me from Las Vegas, NV to Buffalo, NY?"}
{"text":"The initial confrontation at this place is Nasty. They have the rudest security at the door that do not know how to talk to custimers. it's a big turn off STAY away from this place the food is not worth the attitude !!"}
{"text":"After a tragic blimp accident in which I lost my family and my prized Chevy Camaro (how I loved that car!), I had nothing left to live for.  I decided to end it all at a restaurant that promised a swift-but-enjoyable exit.  After consuming a 20,000 calorie \"Octuple Bypass Burger\" with 40 slices of bacon, chili cheese fries, and a deep-fried Twinkie shake, I wrote my last will and testament and posted it to Facebook, in hopes that I might get people to pay attention to me one last time.  Then...nothing.  No heart attack.  No diabetic coma.  Not even a little indigestion.  I demanded my money back, but all the manager did was throw in another order of chili cheese fries for free.  I left even more depressed than I was when I came in."}
{"text":"Horrible Food that has only one thing going for it - a \"view\" if you are into the \"Hooters on Steroids\" atmosphere.  This is a place for men, and I mean it.  Leave the kids at home, and make sure to come hungry.  This place has everything needed for success - CONTROVERSY!"}
{"text":"The heart attack grill is a hell of an experience that is something you have to do at least once in your life!  There are scales inside and out the restaurant and if you weigh over 350, you eat for free!  We were greeted kindly and took a peak at the hilarious menu where the veggie option is candy cigarettes.  We wore hospital gowns and were seated quickly. Our server was friendly and I was not allowed a diet coke or coke zero ... Not enough calories!  The restaurant has tons of comical parody movie posters like gone with the waist line, a hilarious biblical mural of all the major burger chains, more cartoon nurses and mannequins, TVs with music videos of the staff and doctor/owner and news reports and so much more as per my pics. Incredibly stimulating for the eyes!  My partner against crime had the chocolate milkshake which was full of fat and had a piece of butter on top!  I had the double bypass burger and flatliner cheese fries. The doctor/owner brought our drinks out in a timely fashion and our nurse/waitress was superb the whole time.  Our food came out fairly quick. The fries were really good and easy to eat with a giant portion. The burger had large buns and simple ingredients. The meat patties were nothing special. Shake shack or smashburger are much better but it wasn't a bad burger.  Fortunately I finished my meal because if you don't.... You can get paddles by your waitress which was happening right next to us. We saw a little child get egged on by his family to get paddled and he screamed an agony. A military man cried in pain and the most hilarious was two oriental tourists who yelped the loudest I have ever heard. Three fierce paddles that are recorded on a tablet and performed by your waitress.  The washrooms have more obscene sights like the picture of George bush and Obama on the urinials and cartoon nurses commenting on 'size.'  There is all kind of art work and displays throughout that make this whole experience worth the time and the food is not bad!"}
{"text":"There's a scale outside of this restaurant that, if your weight exceeds 350lbs, you eat for free.  Do I have your attention now?!  This place offers endless fries, single, double, triple & quadruple ole bypass burgers as well as, um, nurses to be sure that your dining experience here isn't killing you.  All kidding aside, this place is and should be treated as a satire to what you SHOULD be eating - this is a rare delicacy at best and should be kept that way.  Worth the visit if you find yourself on Freemont Street..."}
{"text":"Go there for the show not the food. Entertainment value may or may not be worth the price of the hamburgers. don't even try one of the hot dogs with chili nasty nasty nasty. You can get better chili at Wendy's and they're still comes out of a can I don't know what they did to this one. but it was ugly at best . You can do it so that you can check it off of the bucket list but don't set your sights real high. I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is truly a gimmick. It might even have been created on a dare.  But, a gimmick that makes a darn tasty burger.  The menu warns you, up front, what you are walking into.  Specifically, it warns you about the specific kind of surgery that you are likely going to require if you continue eating these burgers.  The fries are fried in lard and the milk shakes have the highest milkfat percentage of any shake traditionally produced.  In fact, they tried to run it a couple percentage points higher, I am told, but the shake machine kept seizing up.  So, just to flaunt reality, they will drop pats of butter into some of your shakes.  This is truly a place where you go to say \"to the wind\" with all dietary restrictions. And vegetables. And sobriety. And sanity.  Seating is more than ample here and you don't leave hungry.  Prices are reasonable and the mural on the back wall, alone, is worth the price of any menu item."}
{"text":"Drove from LA to chander just to eat here and it did not dissapoint me. So worth the 12 hour round trip drive."}
{"text":"Loveeeeeee this place. The workers here made it very pleasant and fun. Best part was the spanking at the end. The girls know how to give a good spanking. Food comes with big portion so we shared. I ordered wine and it came in an IV bag fun fun and the music and atmosphere was awesome. I loved my experience here!"}
{"text":"The entertainment was great. As far as the burgers, meh. Its a great tourist attraction. Go for the fun of it. Take a blood thinner before you go!"}
{"text":"This place is a great novelty restaurant, the food was okay but more importantly you go for the entertainment and there was alot here, still curious as to why it is cash only, probably some legal loophole that grants you the ability to mock overweighted people and judge people that finish eating by means of a \"paddaling\""}
{"text":"went to freemont street and seen heart attack grill. We had seen it on tv previousely so we thought it would be \"good\" because it looked good on tv. At first greeted by staff then gowns and id bracelets put on. We ordered our food and i have to say the burger itself had NO taste of any seasoning at all!. I know the fries are cooked in lard but they tasted bland also. It takes cash only and you have to PAY for water. The only thing good was the coke from mexico and the music! Definately would not go again."}
{"text":"Went with my buddy and had a fun experience. Definitely one of my favorite places I've been to in Vegas. The food is hella big and good, especially chili cheese fries. The whippings aren't bad at all either"}
{"text":"Yeah it kind of sux! Burgers aint that great (Though not terrible), girls aint that hot (At all :( ), place aint very exciting (or clean).  Yeah it is kind of cool that they are dressed as nurses and you get a little hospital bracelet with their name and such. However, putting on mandatory hospital gown is odd and kind of off putting (To me anyhow). They also do have a bar and sell unfiltered stogies of some kind.   They also do not take CC!!! WTF I say! Is is a bit too much \"Old times charm\" for my taste. There is an ATM right in there so there is no real need to bring cash with you.   I do not know, whole thing kind of odd. It would fit my better in like Greer or Page or something, rather then in Chandler."}
{"text":"had heard about this place for several years, and it seems like not a week goes by that some reader doesn't suggest it to me. Motoring across the Southwest today, and finding myself on I-10 in Phoenix at lunchtime, it was the perfect opportunity for me to check out the Heart Attack Grill.  This place screams \"fun\" and \"man cave\" from the moment you walk in. One of the \"nurses\" approaches each patron at the door with the requisite hospital gown and wrist bracelet which \"must\" be worn in the \"operating room\". Your choice of seating include a counter, tables, or an outdoor patio.  The menu is placed in front of you, and the choices are few: a single, double, triple, or quad bypass burger; a buffet of fries (fried in pure lard, the sign says). The server was quick to point out they have no diet drinks or iced tea, just real coke (what, not Mexican coke?), Jolt, or PBR. For real men, they sell Lucky Strikes and Camel Straights.  I ordered the quad, for effect, they offer you a choice of cheeses, but otherwise, the decorating is up to you, at the ample fixins bar. (Which have some of the best dill chips I have ever had, anywhere).  It's help yourself to the lard fries, too (small extra charge), which are dumped into a bin up front, hot, fresh, and very frequently.  My \"nurse\" Alicia, brought my quad out to the table, and stopped for a second for a photo op. Yes, there IS a burger in that photo, folks.  She said \"you are really going to enjoy eating this,\" to which I could only reply, \"hell, I can't eat it, I'm just going to admire it!\"  I went back to the fixins' bar for more pickles to much on the side.  I managed to work my way through one of the patties before tossing in the towel (gown?). The burger is full-flavored, and holds together well, indicating a pretty high fat content, which would be appropriate for the venue. It's like when people ask you if you like your chicken 'wet or dry.\" If you like your burgers \"wet\", this is the place for you.  The service is over the top amazing, with the cheery girls, and knowledgeable kitchen staff that interacts with the patrons. This place has been around for several years, and I don't know why the landscape isn't dotted with them, certainly more \"fun\"and unique that the any of the recent burger expansions, IMHO. Why hasn't Hooters bought this to prop up their ailing concept?  If you happen to be in Phoenix, or are just passing through, make the Heart Attack Grill an \"emergency stop.\""}
{"text":"I loved this place. I went twice. Was in Vegas for 11 days, a friend of mine came to hang out a couple days and I dragged him to it.  He's a born again Christian, and was horrified.  I was LOLing.  If you want an amazing candle-lit dinner, just go home.  This ain't the place for you.  IMO, many of the reviews here are irrelevant.  Just ignore them.  Trust me.  If you're easily offended and have jumped on the bandwagon for every attempt on social reengineering, then again...just go home.  You might want to steer clear of Dick's Last Resort in the Excalibur Casino, as well.  That place, and the Heart Attack Grill, are just wrong.  If you aren't easily offended and love to be crude, this is a good place for you.  I love this. I felt at home.  That said.  1. Expect to pay cash 2. Expect to wear a hospital gown 3. Expect a spanking if you don't finish your burger  With the exception of #1, it seems that there IS a heaven.  Oh well, can't have everything.  Day 1: Finished a triple bypass.  Day 2: Finished a single-bypass.  The single bypass was much better.  The triple-bypass was just too much, but I was able to finish.  That's the important thing.  The taste sort of diminished, fast.  The single-bypass, was honestly one of the best burgers I've ever had.  Both days, I had a Mexican coke.  Yes, they have this.  They also give you shots in a pill bottle, or in a syringe.  You can have the nurse \"administer\" your medicine, as I did.  Would I go again?  Hell yeah!  I might even buy my own hospital gown.  Sure beats the hell out of worrying about spilling on yourself."}
{"text":"Talk about food porn.   Heart Attack Grill is pure entertainment, using its controversial menu and suggestive theme to grab patron's attention.   The theme is medical, with your waitresses being (sexy) nurses and the guy at the door being your doctor.   When you first walk in, you are introduced to the concept and menu of the place. ***NOTE: this place is cash only! Lucky for you there is an ATM readily available for your cash needs but I'm guessing it charges.   You are then taken through a door and asked to put your hospital gown on. Then you are taken to your table. The burgers here are appropriately named... Single bypass burger, double bypass, and so on.   The single bypass, which is essentially a normal burger with chili, is in itself a 2,000 calorie dish. THAT. IS. MY. ENTIRE. DAYS. WORTH. OF. CALORIES. but who's counting?! (Me... I'm counting.. And also freaked out). The rest were higher in calories, I heard up to 6,000 for one burger.   We were informed that the single bypass is the only burger you are allowed to share. Reason being, anyone who doesn't finish their burger gets a spankin' (a sexy spankin'?) from their \"nurse\" which -- I saw it happen to three people throughout my entire meal -- catches the attention of the ENTIRE restaurant. That booty smacking is loud.   Your cocktails/shots are served in a cute little prescription bottle. The whole restaurant was consistent with theme and that was pretty cool.   Why two stars? Well, I'm not a huge fan of the controversy that surrounds this place. I shared my single bypass burger and fries and didn't even order the chili on my burger. It was good, but nothing spectacular, but that's the problem -- it was just a burger.   The only real spark this place has on its name is the theme (well executed, IMHO, but I'm a huge sucker for themes) and the controversial high caloric menu.   I don't know about you, but I don't think I would put that many calories in my body in one sitting AND overpay for a mediocre meal. Better be the best damn burger for that. Once is enough for this place."}
{"text":"I had the Double Bypass burger with bacon. I should have ordered it with no onions, since they were basically inedible (for me, at least; way too strong and piquant, overwhelming the rest of the flavors), but the rest of it was quite good. Worth the whopping 5000 calories. The ambience is really fun, with that campy hospital vibe going on, and all the employees were really nice.  Now, as much as I like my buttocks to be painless, I'm disappointed that they didn't enforce the spanking rule on our table (a friend of mine failed to finish his Triple Bypass and, well, I didn't eat those onions). Anyway, it was a fun and tasty experience, but definitely not a healthy one."}
{"text":"What's The Matter, Can't You Take It?  I was really pissed when Jillian's closed. It was one of the few venues that featured local bands and appealed to the under 21 crowd. That's a rarity in the valley, the biggest advancement of all ages shows on the strip was in the earliest incarnation of Gameworks, when it had the climbing structure in the coke bottle.   Would Jillian's replacement be worthy? I went in with a big open mind, which is necessary here.  First thing you notice outside is, how do I put it nicely? Well, they didn't. It's not a truck scale. It's to weigh those that challenge it's 350 lb. mark. If you're heavier than that, you get to eat for free, the details of which I'm not sure of. I'm guessing it's not for a side salad.  Since I didn't have much time, I decided to go in for a PBR and because I was reluctant to binge in a place that encouraged it on this level.   A new place has a \"lot to take in\" factor when you enter, must be a board of tourism rule more than a one of fine dining. Before you can visually climatize a couple of hostesses (let's face it, there's no hosts in a breastaurant) put a cloth gown on you. You realize everyone is dressed this way. Is that their form of a bib?   They put a strap on your wrist, get it it's like a hospital patients'?! There are Vegas restaurants that want you to advertise to other tourists where you've been. Where did they get that big white paper hat? We have to eat there!(?) Where'd they get that guitar you can drink from? Let's go there!  They hand you a menu, that lets you know you can buy it on the cover. I sat at the bar because I love bar service for several reasons. At this bar, there's a \"doctor\" bartender. I could focus on the carnival that unfolds in this place.   There's a lucky strike cigarette machine (unfiltered). There are servers dressed in tight cleavage nurse outfits. If you're eating here, chances are you've heard about the people who have actually died that have had some connection to the place. While other businesses would shun this, this place advertises it. A local has their ashes on the bar and I heard the bartender tell his story 4 times the time I was there. For 1 beer.  With a wooden paddle, nurses actually spank guys that don't finish their burgers, so you better not have to pee or crap if you can't finish. See how funny it is that a cute nurse gets to spank a guy while you eat dinner?   They offer 4 burgers for their menu, the difference being the number of patties. They took a cue from the success of In-n-out burger's minimal menu. But at least HAG offers pickles, bacon and mustard.   On the walls there are  a lot of collages of images, 3 kinds: 1) towards the bathroom, there are all kinds of classic pieces of art with a HAG modification of it, maybe to appeal to \"higher class,\" patrons? 2) on the far back wall are pop movie posters, each has a HAG modification, to appeal to 20-30 somethings, get it? 3) a mural on the far wall of the last supper, and the participants are fast food mascots eating with a doctor from HAG, to appeal to kids, get it?   It's a big lesson in ad marketing, mix your brand with successful, well known symbols as if to be endorsed by them, using them under the copyright loophole of spoofing. Star Max Wars, get it? With Luke Maxwalker.   This place seems to cater to the bachelor/ette crowds, as well as the people that give the guy they know that coughs with their smoking problem a pack of cigarettes. It's based on peer dares, weather or not you can \"handle it.\"  Yeah, I got the jokes. And in Vegas, I certainly have handled many challenges of unsafe drinking, drugs and sexual uh... This place is crawling with gimmickry and I just felt like I was in front of planet hollywood, with all the ads yelling at me with flashy lights and people sticking fliers in my face.  This place is like tabloid tv, it may be fun to check out and \"laugh at,\" but I wouldn't want to be a regular part of it until I became it."}
{"text":"You come here for the gimmick! God knows it's not for the food. You would think the amount of lard they use would some what make a decent burger. I still wonder if it's actually good ole cow meat they serve or something else.. the health department needs to give this place a once over in the kitchen area cause I'm not convinced things are \"ok\" in the kitchen. If your going to tout your restaurant as the most unhealthy place to it fine, but make it because the food is so good and greasy not because literally your going to get food poisoning. Guys I under stand it's a tourist trap but word of advice your taking a chance on eating the meat here im putting that out there now."}
{"text":"It was pretty cool. The experience is what we went for to be honest and that was met. The food was not all that good. We ended up eating the smallest burger and the chili dog with bacon. French fries and onion rings. The meat on the burger wasn't seasoned all that well and it was just blah.   However, the spankings we witnessed were great and so was the karaoke. So that made up for the food. The pricing ..... it's cool. Stupid to add $2 to the burger to get fries ... it should come with the fries especially since the burger is already $9 but whatever."}
{"text":"I came all the way from South Carolina on business to enjoy the Heart attack grill experience. It was exactly what I expected with good customer service, good food, and good entertainment. I will for sure comeback. I do wish they accepted debit/credit cards but they do have ATM's close by. I loved it."}
{"text":"A word of caution! Don't use their ATM if you have  a credit union. My Fiancé and I visited last Saturday. We expected to grab a to-go burger, just to say we tried it. We ended up staying over an hour and having an absolute blast. Nurse Stephanie was fantastic. She is perfect for her job and went above and beyond for us. The food was amazing, although, if you are not used to the grease, be careful (if you know what I mean). The only reason I gave 3 stars is, when I tried to take money out of the ATM, I got an error message. So my Fiancé used his card and we thought everything was fine. Come to find out I was charged for the money I never received. I contacted the grill and am waiting to hear back, hopefully we will resolve this quickly and I can up my review to 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I saw this place on a TV show ages ago and felt the family and I had to check it out whilst in Vegas. What was also kinda cool is that this is located on the old strip, which is kinda cool and more fun than the main strip. The restaurant was a fun experience and different to any culinary experience I've ever been to! If you're in the mood for a laugh check this place out."}
{"text":"I thought the whole concept was cute, at first.  I wasn't crazy about wearing a hospital smock, which you have to wear if you want to eat in the restaurant.  I had on a jacket and I was freezing the entire time.  The decor was very drab and floors very dirty.  The music and videos were good (80's stuff).  I ordered a single burger with bacon, fries and a chocolate shake.  The burger and fries were not very good, not quality meat, and the bacon was limp, as was the fries.  The shake, however, was very good, rich and thick (even though I could have done without the dab of butter on top).  They do not serve free water, you have to pay $2 for a small bottle.  They only accept cash, but they do have an ATM in the restaurant, for a fee.  The waitress was nice.  I will not go here again based on the fact that the food was not good, and there are too many places in town with great burgers."}
{"text":"Great concept, lots of associated imagination; great bun on burger; unremarkable half pound patty; didn't get the bacon, got cheese and chili; no hot sauce, just ketchup and mustard; I guess hot sauce is too healthy...; they could up the ante a bit on the ten dollar burger; by the way, splitting a single is probably best unless you're really capable of overeating;  the onion rings fell way short of expectations; a 10:1 ratio of breading to onion; and really tasteless unless you just want a carrier for ketchup.  Atmosphere cool, but don't go to eat...maybe get the milkshake or beer."}
{"text":"What a fun adult, hospital themed american food place. The food is good nothing too special but the theme of the place is great. The servers are nurses. As you enter you are made to wear a hospital gown and are punished with a spanking from a nurse if you dont finish your meal;). Worth a visit if you are in the downtown area."}
{"text":"I spotted this place on the Travel Channel on a show for most extreme restaurants. Originally it was based in Arizona, but it has since moved to Vegas. When we saw it in old Vegas, we knew we had to try it. One of the sexy nurses who was featured on the tv show was actually working while we were in!   It's a fun experience. First you're weighed in. If you're over 350 pounds, you eat for free! While we were there, we saw a super tall guy win a meal!  They have a giant scale outside the restaurant and one inside as well.   When you \"check-in\" they dress you in hospital gowns. There are sexy nurses and doctors as the wait staff.   The menu is extremely limited. It's just bacon cheese burgers, ordered by single, double, triple or the quadruple bypass. We got the standard which is the double.  We also got fries and shared a shake.   I absolutely love salty food, but the fries were insanely salted. I ate some, but I couldn't finish them, and that's saying something. The shake was rich and creamy, but it comes with a pad of butter on top! Crazy. You can even get your shake boozy with alcohol in it.   The food wasn't remarkable, but it wasn't bad. I wouldn't come here again, but it was definitely fun to try.  If you don't finish your food, the sexy nurse will come and whip you with a leather belt (I think you can decline, but it is offered as part of the service). I think it's also offered as part of their birthday service. If you're too full, they'll wheel you out in an wheelchair!   This is definitely an experience. I'm glad we tried it."}
{"text":"I was in Chandler, Arizona today for business and tried this place out after hearing about it online.  My opinion? it's a simply \"meh\" place.  1) the nurses aren't gorgeous... they were pretty and friendly enough girls who did their job well and had their schtick down cold but noone was hot enough that I would kill myself by dining here regularly for. Sorry, ladies.  2) The burger itself isn't anything special. Greasy, yes. Premiumly priced, but nothing outstanding. For a greasy burger, I would totally recommend 5 guys (even though its a chain from VA - there's one in Fremont, CA now) over this place.   One highlight was definitely the bun (not necessarily the preparation). I'd say a star was earning in the Yelp rating for this bun. The bun is a quality, flaky piece of bread... but even with a 1/2 LB single bypass, the poor bun couldn't hold up to the grease it was subjected to.   The fries were pretty good but again, greasy for the sake of being greasy. They are tasty but nothing special.   I'm lactose intolerant so I cannot comment on the whole buttermilk shakes thing.  The lard manifests itself in a greasiness that is still in your mouth after you've eaten.   It's fairly decent marketing job (congrats to the owner) but honestly, it's a schtick that where you will go there once and laugh (kinda like Casa Bonita in Denver)... but it's not some place any (normal) person could go to regularly. Also, if you can eat for free because you are a big boy, you have no business going to this joint. The extra calories to be had here probably aren't worth the reduction in your life expectancy.  Verdict: Good to try but NOT worth making a trip out here to dine.  -g"}
{"text":"Hurray for Heart Attack Grill! Fun! Fun! Fun!  Free burger for anyone over 350lbs!  Just outside the restaurant is a gigantic scale. The hostess greeted us with hospital gowns and wrist bands. When we sat down, all I wanted to do was look around the room and talk about all the faux movie posters and news footage. I noticed that everyone was having a good time! A lot of people looking in from the outside and taking pictures.   The bartender was a \"doctor\" and the wait staff were \"nurses\". If you don't finish your burger, you get spanked with a paddle!  Menu is simple. Burger and fries. How many patties you want is the real question. A good tasting burger with some awesome fries! Coke is served in a bottle and the service was delightful!"}
{"text":"So I went here around lunch time just to check out the hype. I can't really knock this place because they set out what they intended and they delivered. I'm personally not crazy about this place but if your really hungry and want to get full with a heavy burger, while looking at some sexy ladies then this is exactly the place. I would go as far as to say its a little above average hooters just with slightly better food. I only got a single patty which was kind of pricy but I can see how you can save a little cash after adding more patties or bacon, because its only like a buck to keep stacking the burger. I did like the fact that they don't use small patties or buns. It was a good burger but nothing I couldn't just get at Red Robbins.  The day I went we got good service so no complaints there. The nurse we had frequently checked up on us to see how we were doing and if we needed any condiments. It is true about the spanking and how hard they hit. I didn't receive it myself but you can tell they are not trying to kill you, but they put effort into it. There was something I didn't really care for and that was the décor. The place tries to be different and hospital themed but it comes off lame and just feels bleh. I think that needs to be changed. One other problem was that they only accept cash, I figure they would be established enough to be able to take card, but I guess not. Didn't have a bad experience but this place is more a 3.5 if I disregarded the cons."}
{"text":"**CASH ONLY**  Mediocre food but definitely an interesting experience for when you don't wanna just drink in Vegas.  Located in Fremont Street (The Old Las Vegas Strip), the Heart Attack Grill is a place to go to when you want to be ashamed/spanked for not finishing your food. I can see the appeal here because it's a weird experience that you can say you had - especially when you have to wear a hospital gown while eating your food.  The girls that work here are all dressed up as nurses, while the men are dressed up as doctors (even the busboy was dressed up as a doctor). As well, they have interesting decor such as a painting of \"Ronald Mcdonald's Last Supper w/ his Fast food friends.\" They also got some interesting music videos that contain the actual waitresses and doctors working there.  So what makes this place pretty wild is the fact that they will spank you with a paddle and will even let you purchase the paddle they used on you if you don't finish your food. The rule here is that you can't share any burger that contains more than 1 patty and you will get spanked if you don't finish.  Since my friends and I were too scared to get spanked, we decided on getting a single burger patty with everything on it (chili, cheese, tomatoes, onions, lettuce, and ketchup) and an order of their fries (deep fried in pure lard baby!).  We also got jello shots.. which were really disgusting but they were cool to take pictures with.   The food wasn't anything impressive and kinda pricy for what it was..but you're just really paying for the crazy experience that you can reminisce on when you over-ordered and are about to waste your food."}
{"text":"It seems to me that a lot of the 1 and 2 star reviews completely missed the concept, dont underatand the gimmick, or ate here already knowing that they were not going to enjoy it in the first place. This place is designed to make you say wtf, there is a little person spanking grown men who cant finish their food. If you take stuff like this too seriously, you should not eat here.  My experience was great. We had a group of 7 aged 6 months to 60. Kids dhared a milkshade which was the bomb. The women ordered the single bypass, all were able to finish it, even my 14 year old daughter who weighs about a buck twenty. My dad and i went for the double bypass and it was delicious. We did order onion rings which we definately did not need, everyone was stuffed for the rest of the day after this but we walked it off afterwards. The prices are nit overly expensive and it is CASH ONLY. The artwork all over the building is hilarious, including a wall mural last supper recreation with fast food mascots.   My recommendation would be to plan on a day eating here, go for lunch, eat a light breakfast and enjoy the rest of your day. We had a good time here, dont take it too seriously."}
{"text":"Had the Quad-Bypass Burger (20 bacon). Was able to get through 3/4 of it. Did not mind the hospital gown, and avoided the spanking for not finishing :) Those girls are mean! Videos playing on the TVs were kind of lame (remakes of the actual video by the staff). Still great experience, was on my bucket list."}
{"text":"If you want to have some fun, it's the place for you. There's a scale outside of the restaurant so you could weigh yourself before and after eating the food. If you don't finish your burger, the waitress will \"smack\" your butt in front of everyone. Cool place."}
{"text":"Had a great time here.  There's a scale before you walked in and if you weigh 350 or more, you get to eat for free. The employees wore scrubs and sexy nurse uniforms.  The food portions were huge and the chocolate shake was so thick, it was so good!! Everyone had to wear a hospital gown. And if you don't finish your food, you get a good spanking from one of the employees. The drinks were a bit pricey but the excitement and fun was so worth it. For the adventure seeking tourist, this place is a must visit on your list."}
{"text":"Love this place !!!!  Went while we were on our honeymoon.  Food was great, so was service !!!  We can't wait to go back !!!"}
{"text":"Concept was creative. Interior was nice. BUT FOOD AND SERVICE ARE HORRIBLE!!! Burgers are tasteless and overpriced!! They are cash only and DOES NOT GIVE CHANGE BACK!!! We arrived with some beer and the hosts demanded for us to finish or throw it away?! I understand that it's a policy but the way they demanded us to get rid of it was rude!! STAY AWAY!! IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR GIRLS, JUST GO TO HOOTERS!"}
{"text":"You only go to this joint for the experience. The women are dressed in nurses uniforms which are nice! The food is subpar, you could very well have a heart attack at the HeartAttack Grill! Quick tip: if you don't finish your food, you will get your ass spanked hard with a paddle. Maybe some of you are into that..."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to visit this joint ever since I saw it on the Travel Channel a couple of years ago.. Finally, after several visits to Vegas I made the trip here. The place did not meet my expectations. What they had on TV was all to hyped up! It made it sound like it was fun and games on TV, but when you get to the place its more like disgruntled employees forced to come to work and do their show because they need the money. Yeah, the concept is funny and entertaining but without enthusiastic employees its kind of pointless. There was only one employee who was very enthusiastic, and she did mixed some strong drinks... Then again the drinks here are very strong!   I ordered the single patty burger with bacon. The burger was bland, too much bread, and you know it was frozen. It is edible, so it's not BAD to say the least. You can get everything on the burger which comes with chili, tomato, onion, cheese, etc. Fries is a separate order, and the fries wasn't too good. It tasted like oil. Then again, they deep fry everything in lard so that's why. Unless you can finish anything that you eat, i recommend their single patty burger because if you don't finish your meal here, you will be SPANKED!! Yes, SPANKED! Not some wimpy spanking either, HARD spanking with a paddle...   If you've seen the restaurant on TV and want to visit it, then I would recommend it at least a once time visit. I wouldn't come back just because I want to come back. The only reason why i'd come is only when my friends or family members want to visit the place when we are in Vegas, but it's highly unlikely. Their drinks are strong, and they do give a decent amount for shots, but that's really it. Oh, the place is CASH only so make sure you bring CASH! They do have an ATM but you know, it's like a $5 charge!"}
{"text":"Burgers aren't the attraction .I was seriously hoping for a good tasting burger. Sorry."}
{"text":"Super fun dining experience. Pretty sure men don't finish their food on purpose and those nurses hit pretty hard.  The Jello shots were delicious and the burger was really good.  I recommend avoiding the onions on your burger as ours were so strong you almost couldn't eat them. Went back a second time for shakes with the kids. Well recommend to anyone going to Vegas"}
{"text":"It is what you would expect from any themed place called \"Heart Attack Grill\".  Mirrors on the bottom part of the bar so you can see up the skimpy outfits the \"nurses\" wear at the bar.  Van in the drive through section is painted to look like an Ambulance.  Hamburgers are named after cardiac events.  The food was bad, greasy unlimited fries and a giant hamburger that tasted as if they mixed in filler of some kind we had never experienced before.  If you plan on going, enjoy the experience cause the food will not be something you would head back for again."}
{"text":"Onion rings were good.  There were four of us and we could not even eat the burgers. They don't taste like beef. Terrible. I liked he theme until we tasted the food. Then we lost our sense of humor since it was such a waste of money. Waitresses were very nice."}
{"text":"Cute concept but the food was awful and we left not feeling well.  My son even threw up his meal. :(  they go so far out of their way to be unhealthy that it is gross!!!!!  Milk shakes actually come with a pad of butter on top. When you take a bite your mouth feels coated with butter.  The french fries, cooked in lard were soggy. So.... soggy lard fries = disgusting.  The burgar was not bad but not great.  Like any frozen Patty would taste.  The only plus was that the bacon was crispy.  The cute points....  waitresses dressed like nurses.  You are given a wrist band and a hospital gown when you walk in and if you dont finish your food you can get a spanking from a \"hot nurse\"  the wine comes in an IV bag and they have shoy glasses that look like pill bottles.  I think they could keep their concept and focus a little more on quality and less on trying to kill their customers with artery clogging ingredients.  It is possible to be unhealthy AND good and I think they failed at that."}
{"text":"Apparently I never wrote a review for this place...  Went her some time ago with my sister in law from out of town because we happened to be downtown and they wanted to try this place.  The name means what it says..  If you are looking for all the grease you can get into your food and arteries, this is the place for you.  The atmosphere is interesting and I do believe it is a place worth going to at least once so you can say you have been there but to grease up like this over and over the outcome is sure not expected to be a good one.  If you are a foodie like me, this is a fun place to check out, but the quality of the food and where it comes from is something one cannot verify and the type of grease they use over and over I am sure is bound to eventually give you what the name implies.    Have fun as it is a fun place to visit...."}
{"text":"They were so much better in Arizona. The food, the costumes, the service, the attitudes, all of it. Back in Chandler and Tempe, it was a hedonist paradise.   It was campy before with its sexy nurses and absurdly large burgers and the policy about getting to eat for free if a person weighs more than 350 pounds. Yeah, this all carried over.   Now you are required to wear a hospital gown they provide and if you don't finish your meal, you're forced to stand in front of a camera while one of the nurses strikes you with a paddle from behind, recording your every facial expression. Honestly, it at times got disturbing. The loud WHACKS against people's backsides would pervade throughout the room while everyone watched and strangers shot video with their phones. It wasn't playful spanking; these ladies were really winding up and letting the paying customer who dared utter, \"I'm full,\" have it.    There's much more alcohol than there was before with the option of getting it in prescription bottles, IV drips, and syringes. This is probably the only fun aspect that I'm glad they achieved here, which I didn't see when it was one state over. Granted, it's definitely not cheap to drink here.   Again, the food just wasn't up to snuff. It didn't have the same flavors, it was greasier (which I guess they were aiming for), and things like the chili fries were overdone and dried out. Maybe they figured the chili would disguise it or compensate?   It's pretty cheesy and if you're easily offended, steer clear of it, but with sensibilities like those what would you be doing walking around Vegas?"}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times in this and the last location they were in (which has since become its own T&A restaurant called \"The Grill Next Door\" if I remember right).   Originally I started coming for the novelty of it all, but now whenever I'm in the Phoenix area I make a point of having at least a single-bypass before I leave town.   The burgers have been consistently good (eating one is like trying to tackle a huge meatball sub), but since their most recent move the Flatliner fries have been drier and harder when my boyfriend and I get them.   I totally dig that they serve the \"Hecho en Mexico\" Coke in the glass bottles. MUCH better formula (made with cane sugar as opposed to high fructose corn syrup)."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place was the atmosphere. It is fun and there are ladies in nurse costumes with a paddle.   My burger was dressed well and tasted pretty decent. It didn't taste bad but eating the burger was a little messy, so don't forget to bring some napkins.  People who weigh a little more on the scale have a chance to win free food!"}
{"text":"It's a themed restaurant - either you are with it or not. Yes, they do make fun of the obesity issue in america - but honestly, it is what it is. From the get go, you have to wear a hospital gown to eat your meal. Also, you get spanked if you don't finish what you ordered. Might sound harsh, but it is hilarious and you will have a good time. Will come back!"}
{"text":"Fun!  Just went to say we had been there!  Now we have!  You enter, can see menu before you go in.  Cash only!  Can not split a meal.  Two downers.  But does have ATM at entrance that charges lowest fee in Vegas++!  You get your pt gowns, seated and order!  But beware!  You must east 100% or get spanked by your nurse/waitress!  I saw a few guys brought almost to tears-they don't hold back and it was awesome entertainment!  They do hold back for the girls/kids.  However, I don't think I'd take my kids here, more for adults/older teens.  The food was great!  No complaints. Waitress nice.  You eat free if you weigh in at 350+ IV bags of wine, 60 cc Jell-O shots ... A lot of fun!  Good experience.  Kudos to the owner for such an original idea.  Went back next day and bought t-shirts. Reasonable price.  Left out $75 poorer but didn't have to have another meal until the next night!  Totally worth the experience.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Ok, I know I shouldn't even go to this place, but how can you not pass up a place called The Heart Attack Grill?  Im a big burger lover and the burgers here are just delicious.  Yes, I am aware of how they make the burgers and what they use on the buns and fries.  If you sit and think about what you're eating, you wont enjoy a thing.  if you just sit back, enjoy your surroundings and food, you're gonna have a helluva time.  Ive been here three times...  Loved it each time.    TIP: Try not to go here but once a month.  It is a shit ton of calories you're taking in."}
{"text":"Boo, good idea, bad execution. Ladies were fun atmosphere was very Vegas and easy going, but the food is blah at best and.   Beer is cheap and you get a lot of blah food though!"}
{"text":"Came here a couple years ago. Very underwhelming and a tourist trap. I don't know how reheated burgers the next day were somehow better than the original, but that happened... Went here with friends, but won't be returning."}
{"text":"I visited the Heart Attack Grill in Phoenix a few times, and was really excited when Dr. Jon brought the concept here.  I love this place.  I've read through all of the reviews here, and the responses seem to indicate people who don't get it.  This place UNABASHEDLY is what it is.  If you don't like it, go somewhere else.     *****  There are a few of the common points in these reviews I'd like to respond to -   #1 - Price - I think this place is very reasonable for what you are getting.  The single burger is a half pound, comes with fries, and runs about $7.50.  It's about $2 more than a large McDonald's value meal, and that $2 is paying for the atmosphere and a better overall quality of food.    #2 - Burgers - Are you going to get a Gourmet burger?  No.  But you'll get a REALLY good fast food burger.  If you are expecting a 5 star burger here, you are at the wrong place.  The Heart Attack is essentially a really fun, upscale FAST FOOD joint.  Think \"In-n-out\" rather than \"Gourmet Burger.\"  Do you get to choose how well done the burger is, or what kind of cheese it has?  Nope.  But you can't do that at McDonald's or Wendy's either.  If you are looking for fancy, this place isn't for you.  #3 - The Fries - I like the taste of lard cooked fries. (Have since I was a kid)  They do tend to be a little soft and chewy as opposed to crisp, and they have a very different flavor than fries cooked in vegetable oil.  Again, this place is what it is.  If you are expecting McDonald's style super crispy fries, you're out of luck, but give this a try, and you may find you enjoy them.  (I do miss the unlimited fry bar.  They had it in Phoenix, and opted not to bring it to Vegas)  #4 - Milkshakes - Don't think milkshakes.  Think old school East-Coast frozen custard.  These \"shakes\" are VERY rich, very creamy, very thick, and just enough sweet to make them wonderful without being overpowering.  They are IMHO the best thing on the menu.  I prefer the vanilla.  The chocolate ones use actual cocoa powder, so they have a semi-sweet, dark chocolate kind of taste, which I find a bit bitter, but my wife loves.  Just scoop the little pat of butter out of the way (the same way you'd remove the umbrella from your alcoholic beverage) and dig in to the creamiest ice cream you've ever had.  #5 - Service - I can't speak to the problems that others have mentioned, as I've never had a problem here.  I visited the Chandler location 3 times, and have been to the Vegas location 3 times.  In those 6 visits, I've never had a wait to get a table, and I've never had less than perfect service.  If Dr. Jon is there, he always comes out and welcomes us, and has twice sat and talked with me at length about the restaurant and marketing and business.  (much like the conversation described by Steve F. above)  He's always been very pleasant and a lot of fun.  #6 - Theme - Yes, you have to wear the gowns.  It's part of the fun.  No, they don't serve diet.  Diet soda misses the WHOLE POINT of the place.  You CAN order water, but it comes in bottles.   People...this place is a celebration of excess and fat and tasty food and obesity.  It flies in the face of \"healthy\" and says right on the front door that this food is going to kill you.  Why would you be surprised that the food is grease laden, artery clogging, fattening goodness?   Don't go to a strip club and complain about nudity.  Don't go to a bar and complain about alcohol.  Don't go to a casino and complain about gambling, and for God's sake, if you go to the HEART ATTACK, expect to get over the top fatty food in a fun, cheeky environment...and don't complain if that's what you get when you are there."}
{"text":"We had heard a lot and went there purely for the experience. The owner has stuck to his theme and done good job of it. Hospital gowns for all dinners, waiterres dressed as nurses, drinks are served in IV bag with tube and shots come in syringes. Burgers are nothing great, but if you don't finish then get ready for real hard spanking.  Our red hair nurse was very friendly and a good spanker. We had a fun time watching others get spank and kids ate all their food!! Their chilly hot dog are huge and well lathered with chilly Surely will come again and talk about our experience for a long time."}
{"text":"I really don't understand what the hype is when it comes to this place. We came for dinner one night right before July 4th with friends who live in the area. I think they were trying to show us a good time, but after hearing about this place, I did not want to come. I don't want to sound self-righteous but why would anyone want to come and pay for gross food and an atmosphere that glorifies being unhealthy? This entire place is gimmicky and was not impressive. As I stated before, the food was not good. The hamburger patty and fries tasted weird. The only plus was our waiter, who was funny."}
{"text":"I cannot believe the TERRIBLE service from this place,my family and I went in there and were seated pretty promptly but when it came down to getting our drinks,we waited 15 minutes,and our food,never came. We had waited 45 minutes just to be told that our food was being put on rush,RIGHT NOW. Seriously it took 45 minutes for you to put in an order,that's quite ridiculous! And on top of that,our waitress avoided out table at all cost.this place is a money trap ! A tourist trap. This place is CRAP don't waste your money. If I could zero stars"}
{"text":"The ambiance is what makes the place.  It's kitschy.  It's over the top.  It's pretty awesome.  If you think they take it easy on the spanking, think again.  While I did not feel her fury, I got to see my waitress in action.  Needless to say, if waitressing doesn't work out for her, she should consider a second career in a Turkish prison.  Burger was good.  I passed on the fries since they are fried in lard.  It's mental block, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it.   I did try the milkshake, and was disappointed.  I believe that it was made with cream, not milk, so it was difficult to drink.  The pad of butter on top was amusing.  I'm not going back, once is definitely enough, but I had fun."}
{"text":"Pretty fun atmosphere, when you're first greeted they put hospital gowns and wrist bands on you. All the waitress's are dressed as nurses, the guys are orderlies and the bartender is a doctor.  My gf and I shared the single by-pass burger, butterfat vanilla milkshake and a coke. The burger was alright but the shake was the best I ever had! Very rich!  A couple of the other customers got \"spanked\" because they didn't finish their burgers, frickn hilarius!!  I would go back for the shakes!"}
{"text":"I had many regrets going to Las Vegas. This was not one of them. The triple bypass burger was almost enough to make me forget about the $400 I had lost gambling the night before. Our server was very attentive and also cool. The best part was seeing my friend get spanked for not finishing his food (just a heads up, they really do that). I made sure to finish my food! Although some advice, it is very unhealthy, but who cares? What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas."}
{"text":"Burgers are boring and you're forced to wear a gown in balls heat, mThis place can suck it!!!! I'd rather eat at Burger King. F yobb Smith"}
{"text":"This place was great. everyone in our party had a \"single bypass\" burger (smallest single patty they have) and we all stuffed. The onion rings were out of this world. Cool original themed place. Hot nurses serve you, you wear a gown as a patient, and if you don't finish your burger they spank you.... hard too. we'll be going back"}
{"text":"When in Vegas you must stop here just for experience! The staff are really friendly and will have you laughing the entire time. The menu is fun and playful. The food is just okay but the experience makes up for it."}
{"text":"The burgers and fries are great.... my boyfriend had their hot dog with chili cheese and bacon and absolutely loved it. I thought the hospital gowns they make all patrons wear were fun and super cute to go with the theme. Our waitress was extremely nice and on the ball we never had to wait for anything she was on top of her game and we all ordered drinks that came with custom pill bottle shot glasses. I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone it gets a big thumbs up"}
{"text":"I saw this place on a show and me, and some friends decided to check it out. When we got there, we were blown away by how the place was set up. Was real creative. Our server took good care of us.  Our food came pretty fast. It was neat to be able to build your own.   However, half way through our meals, we had enough. The food was way to greased up. We all ended up getting sick after. I think it might be because we were not used to eating that much junk food in one sitting. It is worth checking out at least once, but be careful what you order."}
{"text":"The burger was good. The service was not. Not sure if we will be back or take any friends from our of town"}
{"text":"If you don't finish your meal, you are spanked with a paddle.  That said, I tried to eat my meal, but it made me sick. The sodium was SO high that I got physically ill.   The burger was OK, the onion rings were good, the chili cheese fries were nothing special. BUT the SERVICE was SLOW, Inattentive and just bad. I drank a bottle of water and wanted another. After 15 minutes, I walked to the bar to ask for another water. Our \"nurse\" saw me and came up, but no apology.  I get the concept, but the food and service gave me NO reason to come back. Not impressed, especially here in Las Vegas were good service is expected."}
{"text":"I do not have a problem with their \"theme\" so to speak of high calorie fattening food. My BIG issue giving it the one star is the taste of the their beef they use. The beef had a old unseasoned almost rotten like taste to it (perhaps my burger was made with a bad peice of beef). Oh and I'm still expected to eat it all, lol. Again I think their theme and the way they do things was cool and was expected since I chose to go there but they should ATLEAST make their burgers taste good"}
{"text":"Is this the best burger in Vegas?..... Not even close, regardless of price. Was is a good burger? Yeah. Was it worth the price? No.  What went wrong or what could be done better: For a 1/2 pound patty, the burger themselves are dry & overcooked........ for this kind of price, I want a dripping, juicy burger, which these are not. The fries are of the skinny kind, which I feel don't really show off the flavor of the lard or the potato.  On the good side, The whole wait staff was very friendly & the turnaround time from seating to food on the table was very fast, also the whole concept of the diner was fun & well thought out. A great place to take non-foodie out of towners, to show them what Vegas is to many people.....or if you like 5 Guys Burgers, you will love Heart Attack Grill burgers."}
{"text":"This place is a cool place. Awesome chicks and cool atmosphere but honestly the food here is mediocre. The fries werent fresh, the burger was a definite 3/5. Overall review is 2.5 stars We waited 20 minutes for our food and it was kind of cold."}
{"text":"My friends insisting on going to this establishment having seen a report about it on tv. It's located in the ol' town of Fremont. You're dressed in a hospital gown, greater by a Nurse** and offered medication. You'll be spanked @ the spanking station if you don't finish your burger.   Food was okay at best, burgers were too dry. place was nice and the experience is worth it (for a once in a lifetime visit)."}
{"text":"If the food were a bit better, I'd give it five stars.  The place is a gimmick restaurant, and it's in a city that is perfect for it.  Some people love the gimmick, some don't, hence all the negative reviews from people getting worked up about not having $10 burger quality in their $8 burger (probably about $4 burger quality).  Oh yeah, they're cash only too, so keep that in mind before showing up with only plastic.  So, with that being said, if you buy into the gimmick, how can you not love the place?  I'm a child of the 80's, so I grew up in the hair band and real hip hop era.  This place has tv's scattered about all over the place playing mostly music videos from that era, from both genre's, so if you are in your 30's, you'll probably really enjoy yourself with the music selection.  If you don't care about that kind of music and just love to booze, this place is still great compared to the other options in and around downtown Vegas.  Their shots are expensive, but their shots are 4 ounces, so compared to the 2.5 shots you'd have had to purchase elsewhere, you come out a bit ahead here.  You can mix your shot with whatever mixer they have, including frozen drinks and several sodas, none of which are prefaced by the word \"diet\".  The shot is delivered in a medicine bottle with a personalized prescription on it.  I personally drink the frozen margaritas; the mango is really great.  Gets me a little tipsy and then I go lose my money at the craps table.  Other drink options?  Continuing the theme, they of course have five or six brands of malt liquor if you're \"feeling ghetto\"; these include Olde English 800, Colt 45, etc.; all in cans that come in brown paper bags of course.  They have a vending machine that sells unfiltered cigarettes, and candy cigarettes if you just want to pretend to destroy your lungs.  The servers, i.e. \"nurses\", will spank you if you don't finish your food, or they'll just spank you if you ask them to; it's a great challenge amongst a drunk group of guys as to who can withstand the most punishment.  You'll see people from all walks of life in here to get a spanking so don't be surprised if you see something completely unexpected.  Now the food.  Yes, if you weigh 350 pounds or more, you eat free.  Their burgers are run of the mill; about what you'd get at a Waffle House late at night; i.e. you're not going to make a trip just to eat here.  It's food though, so combined with the entertainment and booze, it gets the job done, just doesn't make you call your mama and tell her how great it is.  One last thing; if you're a bleeding heart liberal, you'll probably be offended by their receipts.  Where the receipt would normally report \"sales tax\", the text has been replaced with \"Obama's cut\"."}
{"text":"I rate the food a 4. It was good and the portions are huge! I got their single burger and I finished it but was hurting afterwards.   The service however I rate a 2. We didn't have a server greet us until we were ready to order. And we didn't see her again until we were ready to pay.  Also, the atmosphere was fun. The servers were dressed as nurses, someone ordered a drink that was wheeled to her in an IV bag and all the patrons had to put on hospital gowns. The only part that I thought was a little weird was if you don't finish your meal you're spanked by one of the nurses. Of course only older men were participating."}
{"text":"Oh this place was a great, burger was good, staff was great, price was great! Don't expect fine dinning it's a Vegas thing! You are here for the experience! Definitely coming back my next time in town!!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place on TV and when I came to Vegas, this was the first place I wanted to visit. The menu seemed pretty nice and simple. The food was great and our service was great. My only complain was the hostess that greeted us. The younger skinnier girl was very nice and polite. However there was a chunkier taller one who was kinda rude and seemed almost bothered that we showed up. We were taking a group picture and she saw us and said \"can you guys please move over, you guys are taking all the space\". It kinda made me feel uncomfortable. If it wasn't for that I would have given this place a 5."}
{"text":"Había visto en algún programa de Travel & Living Channel TLC, un episodio en el que recomiendan los mejores lugares para comer en Las Vegas, así que en cuanto aterrice en esta ciudad, uno de los lugares a visitar en mi lista de \"no te lo puedes perder\", se encontraba este mismo.  La decoración esta super original y desde que cruzas la puerta, te reciben las Enfermeras-Meseras listas para ponerte tu bata de hospital. El lugar es bastante grande y la idea del negocio es que sus productos te pueden provocar un ataque al corazón por el exceso de calorías. Por ejemplo, las malteadas las sirven con un pedacito de mantequilla, eso no lo había visto en ningún lado. Las hamburguesas aunque sin duda no fueron las mejores hamburguesas de mi vida, si tienen un sabor especial y muchas calorías.   Lo único que no me gusto es que, no te permiten compartir las mega hamburguesas, entonces cada quien tiene que ordenar la propia. Nosotros íbamos con la idea de comprar la mega hamburguesa como con 5 carnes pero para compartirla con toda la familia y no se pudo por que \"no se pueden compartir\".  Lo gracioso del negocio es que la gente que no se termina la hamburguesa gigante puede ser golpeada por las enfermeras en el trasero :O. Y claro que todo el establecimiento se llena de carcajadas. Puedes ver gente con obesidad mórbida la cuál si sube una cantidad de peso come gratis, este restaurante esta loquísimo."}
{"text":"It's not a poor rating because I don't get it. I get it. You're going with a wacky theme and you're celebrating american excess and obesity. Tacky and tasteless, but we can all enjoy tacky and tasteless once in awhile.  Here's the problem-the place lives and (quite literally) dies on this joke. (And taking a lame political cheap shot by calling the Nevada state sales tax \"Obama's cut\"?) Once you get past the decor you're left with a sub-par, overpriced diner with a very limited selection. Hint: adding a separate entry onto the menu for each patty is kind of like increasing your font size to meet the minimum page requirements for a report. Quite literally, all they serve for food is burgers, fries and hotdogs. (They do have shakes, beer, liquor and soft drinks).   The good:  They make a pretty good pumpkin pie and vodka milkshake. The music playing seemed pretty good the whole way through.  The bad: Only taking cash? What year is it again?  Complete lack of variety. You'd think you could throw in dessert options if you're celebrating wanton obesity. You can throw other things into a deep fryer besides fries, you know."}
{"text":"The most disgusting place I have ever been. Completely degrading from the moment I walked in. Its like a Chuckie Cheese with clamiditia and filth."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Heart Attack Grill on Fremont Street.  It's a fun concept.  The servers and hostesses are dressed like nurses and are cheeky.  You have to wear a hospital gown (so in case you have a heart attack, you are already dressed to go!).  There is no diet pop and everything on the menu is not healthy.  They only take cash.  If you weigh more than 350 pounds (they have a scale), your meal is free.  I ordered a rum and Coke.  The rum comes in a pill bottle with your name on it ( Take dosages by mouth until your date looks desirable.  Side effects include dancing on the table and starting fights.)  I ordered fries and a single burger.  They have an eight patty burger if you are up to it!  The burger was good ... I like that it didn't seem like a frozen processed patty and the bun was soft.  By the way, if you don't finish your burger, they spank you with a paddle.  Seriously!  I saw four guys get spanked and it sounded and looked like it hurt.  Needless to say, I ate all my burger!  Kortney was my server and was extremely friendly, fun and attentive.   It was a fun atmosphere and the food was good.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"I didn't go in expecting to rate this with 5 stars.  The only reason I went here was because I was with majority guys and of course they wanted to attack this place. I'm am only giving this review based on the food.   In a nutshell... GROSS. DISGUSTING. PLAIN. You walk in, get gowned, nurse takes your order via iPhone, staff is extremely friendly.... I ordered the single bypass burger...I only ate a tiny amount and my stomach hurt for the next 24 hours.  I feel as though I gained 5 lbs just from that small amount :( The fries made me want to vomit...they are cooked in lard. They only serve coke, water & alcohol.   Bypasses stop at the window and take photos of you eating...it was rather disturbing... I will NEVER eat here again.   BUT...if you are looking for a crazy food adventure...or just an opp to say you have ate at this crazy place....go for it!"}
{"text":"Did not allow my friend with autism to enter or eat in the restaurant at first  \"because of his service animal\" but later said they had the right to refuse us because he was rude. I don't know what business would want to operate in this manner. Please beware of staff if you have anyone with special needs in your party."}
{"text":"\"The Hair in the Food Routine\" from a bald guys perspective. This review is not to bash the Heart Attach Grill, but to share an experience in poor customer service. My goal for this review is to enlighten the readers of the poor customer service, they may receive if they find hair in their food. If just one person decides not to take the chance to eat at this restaurant on one visit to Vegas I believe this review will be justified.  I visit Vegas once every 2 years and always make it to the Heart Attack Grill for one of their unhealthy burgers. I find the theme and the atmosphere hilarious and the concept of why not eat what you want at least once in your life. I find the burgers to be delicious; even though they changed the fries I was still satisfied with my double bypass burger (2 half pound burgers, 10 strips of bacon,  and 10 slices of cheese).   As I am eating my burger I take another bite of this monstrosity and as I am pulling the burger back from my mouth a piece of hair is flossing between my teeth.  Disgusted and embarrassed, because I have been bragging about this place since the last time I visited Vegas, I informed my waitress of what I have found. She went to the manager and the manager stated we will make you another burger.  I stated that this was not acceptable and I would like to speak to the owner.  When I spoke with the owner, I stated my admiration for his product and his business, and that the burger had hair in it and I will gladly pay for all of the other burgers drinks etc. at my table (2 single bypass burgers, 4 jello shots, 4 drinks, 2 beers, 1 double bypass burger) but would like him to comp the hairy burger. He responded  by saying in his 15 years of business he has never fail for the hair in the food routine and he wasn't going to start now.  Now mind you, I am bald with a goatee; the hair in my food was a long black strand of hair, so where would I have gotten the hair from?  I stated making me another burger, where you could sale to another customer for $15, would still indicate a lost in your profit.  Refusing to work with me on any avenue; taking the burger off my bill, even stating that I could pay half of the burger, shows that this guy is hard up for money and doesn't know how to properly run his business.  I had the waitress separate the burger from my bill and paid for everything else. As I was walking out of the establishment, the owner physically assaulted me, by grabbing my camera strap that was around my neck. The Security guard had him release my camera strap and as I was stating what happen, the owner step up to me and tells me to shut up. It escalated to the point to where one of my friends in my party had to restrain the owner while the security guard restrained me and escorted me out of the establishment.  Needless to say, I will never be visiting the Heart Attach Grill in Las Vegas ever again. I am pressing charges against the owner and contacting the Vegas food board about the unsanitary hair in the food.  If this was supposed to be part of the experience then they need to warn the customers; you may find toe nails, head hair, and pubic hair in your food. We will gladly make you another one at your expense, because you put it there even though you're bald and none of our staff wear hairnets when preparing or serving your food.  Buyers beware......."}
{"text":"Definitely come here for the experience. Burgers were ok. The service was great. I got to see my buddy get spanked because it was his birthday. Overall we had a great time here."}
{"text":"the customer service as good, my son picked this place, good food and the music was great Thanks"}
{"text":"Heart Attack Grill was nothing like I was expecting -- there's nothing unique about the taste of these uniquely-prepared burgers.   I'd been looking forward to this visit since I saw their first news appearance from their Arizona location years ago, but despite all of their deliberately unhealthy preparation methods, this is mostly just a tourist trap; the burgers themselves are really nothing special. I had dreamed of biting into a rich, gluttonous, fat-grilled burger and lard-fried fries, but I've had more delicious offerings from food trucks.  The table next to us got a septuple-bypass burger: a towering stack of meat and cheese that started leaning and then finally tipped over shortly after the pictures were taken (I uploaded one of them!). It's certainly a novelty.  As you know, they stick you in scrubs when you arrive and the waitresses are dressed as sexy nurses who offer deceptively strong spankings with a paddle if you finish your meal. My brother partook...I chickened out after seeing the intensity of the smacks!  Rounding out their theme of encouraging vices, they offer cigarettes on the menu. But then they chastise you for smoking. Baffling.  I'm anxious to know if their original location is better. Unfortunately, this Heart Attack Grill was deeply disappointing."}
{"text":"Just for those of you who think of visiting this place...   http://www.ktnv.com/dirtydining/155848485.html  This place has been listed on Dirty Dining (a Las Vegas news segment) back in May of this year for having 40 demerit points, which is one point from being shut down in Las Vegas.  I don't know about you, but if a restaurant is EVER featured on a show like this for the same reasons that HAG was, it's pretty much dead to me. They can claim to have changed, but from what I see anytime I want past the place, it hasn't...  Beware!"}
{"text":"I like this place! Anything any health nut deems unhealthy I'm there. The burgers are good, fries are awesome and the owner of the joint is kick ass! I'm just these days everything gives you cancer and if I'm going to die well dammit Imma go out happy and full of delicious greasy food! Btw I'm 5'8 and 140lbs, so all of you rabbit food veggie losers can suck it. And they only take cash...the way it should be! Fuck plastic! Plus the ATM is only $.75 and whatever wack ass fees your bank charges. So stop whining and complaining and feed your face."}
{"text":"This is a place you go to, just to say you've tried it. It's a tourist attraction and a money making machine. This place takes cash only, you bring outside food or drinks inside, you have to wear a hospital gown at all times, and you can only share the smallest burger  Seen this restaurant on tv before, and how the food is catered to an overweight crowd. This place is known for their ridiculous portions, large calorie intake foods, shakes made with lard, fries deep fried in oil and fat, huge 1lb plus burgers smothered in chili and pounds of bacon. Mmmmm sound awesome, sign me up. Well we get seated and I'm not sure if it was the hospital gown I wore or the thought of having a heart attack, that made me nervous. We ordered the smallest burger they had, an order of fries and 2 bottles of water. We both were barely able to finish the food, with some help from our friends. (Didn't want to get spanked with a paddle in the middle of the restaurant) The food was ok, nothing special. The food tasted like most hamburgers and fries I've tried, minus the massive gut bomb/ heart burn icky feeling I felt about 1 hour later. Uhhhhh I was sweating fat in the cool of the night.  Well I have tried this place once, and one time is enough. Don't think I will be putting my body through that nightmare again."}
{"text":"The idea behind the restaurant is very clever and it was a fun atmosphere but that is where the good review ends. Burger is mediocre at best just super greasy. The fries are alright. The only condiments they have are ketchup, mustard, and Mayo. Service. Is absolutely terrible.....extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Interesting concept.  The burgers were good but not great.  The buns were interesting.  The fries were sub par.  Not quite sure why they call it the \"Heart Attack Grill\" aside from the multi patty and bacon options you can ask for.  I was expecting a greasy delicious mess but was met with a not greasy at all but decent burger."}
{"text":"Butter Fat Shakes and if you are over 350lbs you eat for free! This is very funny experience, however the food was down right bad!"}
{"text":"We had seen Heart Attack Grill on several shows, so we decided we would finally try it after many years of visiting Vegas. I would give the ambience 4 stars and the food 3.5 stars.  The walking in and having to put on a gown and agree to certain conditions was hilarious. The entire atmosphere is over the top and fun. Definitely not for the faint of heart or health conscious that doesn't have a sense of humor.  The food is solid, I had a single bypass with bacon. I wasn't trying to go too big because I wasn't in a spanking mood. Lol My wife had the hot dog with bacon.  Both meals were really good, better than I thought it would be. A lot of times the restaurants that are experience heavy have less than stellar food. This wasn't the case with the Heart Attack Grill, both the experience and the food were excellent."}
{"text":"Was ruined by terrible service. People after us got food before we were even asked about drinks. Was in love from gown until being sat. Maybe I'll give it another try, but I doubt it. Almost walked out until someone approached us, then is was awkward instead of fun:("}
{"text":"Located downtown on the Fremont Street experience the Heart Attack Grill has had a lot of Media attention since its opening back in 2005. This hospital themed restaurant offers an experience you won't soon forget. From the nurses to the pill bottle vodka shots it stays on point 365 days a year. The service however is a bit uncomfortable with what feels like teenage girls in skimpy nurse outfits serving you. Of course the men will still look but it gets weirder when you realize you have the option to be spanked by these young girls. My thoughts on the food are pretty basic and extremely unhealthy. The menu includes the Quadruple Bypass Burger, Quintuple Bypass Burger, Sextuple Bypass Burger, Septuple Bypass Burger, and the Octuple Bypass Burger. These dishes range in weight from half a pound to four pounds of beef. Also on the menu are Flatliner Fries (cooked in pure lard) and the Coronary Dog, Lucky Strike no filter cigarettes, alcohol, Butterfat Milkshakes and full sugar Coca-Cola. For the money you're investing in this meal it is not really worth it for the plain tasting food. My opinion is the Heart Attack Grill is a place that's fun only to say that you've been. However this restaurant is not for the faint of heart. Their moto is \"Eat, Drink, and Smoke their way to Better Health\". But from the overpriced food, inappropriate theme and the fact they lure people over 350lb to come eat free. I think it's best to just keep your distance. Basically the Heart Attack Grill is what it is, a novelty tourist spot. Love, Bug"}
{"text":"This is a nice tourist attraction. Before you are let in they dress you up with a hospital gown. If you do not finish your food you could receive the paddle. Everything is made to be large portions. They do not serve tap water though. Everything that is beverage is sold alcohol, wine in a I V bag, glass bottle soda and bottled water.  On order consisted of a hot dog, triple burger with 15 pieces of bacon, double burger, single burger (2), chili fries, regular fries, 4 sodas and a shake (not so good). All of this cooked in lard. The chili is good I must admit. It came up to $84. Everyone but me finished the food. Ouch!"}
{"text":"Fun decor, great service but the burger was so bad I are 3 bites and was done.  Over-cooked and had a weird taste and texture. Not worth the money spent AT ALL."}
{"text":"This is a place that's not known for the food, nor will they plan on it. Burger, fries, shake and repeat. Basic! So why then do you come here? For fun, a good laugh at your own expense or others and probably both. Huge scale outside where you're bound to be curious enough to step on and those over 350 eat for free. Its actually amusing site to see, especially when the football bulky guy either is of weight or near. So I personally only ordered fries. They make it clear if you dont clear your plate your butt is on the line for a spanking. Its very amusing to see the willing and not so willing come up to bat. Its a memorable occasion. You will spend probably 20bucks and leave full... Satisfied by experience and portions."}
{"text":"This place is is worth the experience. You get to eat in  hospital gowns and drink your wine from an IV bag. My friends and I went on stage and did karaoke and then had burgers. The milk shake was so thick and I got vodka to go with it. The vodka comes in a prescription pill container. My friend got spanked..and it was like she beat him, he was hurting for days.. If you like cheesy places you will love this."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been on my list for a long time... But it disappointed!  I wanted this to blow my mind... but it didn't.  When you walk in you get a gown... pretty cool.  Then you are seated and eventually the waitress will come over.  All in nurse costumes.  Very nice inside.  Interesting art work.    Ordered:   Chocolate butter fat milk shake: VERY GOOD... The only reason this got 3 stars... It had a small piece of butter on top of the shake.  The shake was super thick, and very delicious.   Chili Dog: The hot dog was actually really good, but it had WAY too much greasy chili.  I understand the concept of all the grease, but it ruined the dog.   I would order plain dog next time.  It was very large and came out very hot.   Hamburger: We did a single. No chili...  It was still very large.  the ratio of the entire sandwich didn't work in my opinion.  I thought the burger was tasteless.  A huge disappointment.  Flat-liner Fries...  no chili or cheese... More like FAIL fries.. AWFUL! Reminded me of cold, stale, McDonalds fries... these fries should have been way better.  BIGGEST FAIL!  The paddle hurt!    Great as a theme restaurant... just wish the food was better!  Priced very reasonable in my opinion."}
{"text":"Please stop reading my Yelp and go here. NOW.  The food is pretty good, the fries are fried in LARD, which may sound disgusting but is 'Effing delish.  The waitresses are cute little naughty nurses, barely dressed,  that will sit and flirt with you no matter how fat n' ugly you are. They have burgers, fries, coke, beer, a full bar (?) and smokes (lucky strikes baby).  This is not a kid friendly place nor is it a good idea to bring the Mrs. here for your aniversary dinner.  But go, and you shall be rewarded.  Also if you finish (or attempt at the very least) a double, triple or quadruple bypass burger they wheelchair you out to your car.  Awesomeness ; free of charge."}
{"text":"An experience EVERYONE must have! The waitress/waiter are attractive, the food is amazing & the location is perfect (Fremont St.)!! What more could you ask for?? I live in So Cal and stumbled across this place via social media. I think the theme is amazing and put it on my birthday list of things to do. I was scared to try because of how fattening everything is, but honestly it was the best burger I've ever had! I DARE YOU NOT TO FINISH EVERYTHING YOU ORDER ;)"}
{"text":"If you like eating the dry skin from your grandpa's feet whilst being surrounded by \"hot\" nurses with busts so big I hope HAG has health insurance that can cover a good chiropractor, then by all means go ahead and eat here.  Burger: dry. Much like the aforementioned skin of your grandpa's feet. Fries: hot garbaggio. It tasted like it was fried in 2 week old grease from your grandpa's house.  Women: run-of-the-mill breastaurant looking women. Uggo on top, curvy on bottom, shattered self-image, yadda yadda yadda.  Overall, I'm pretty much unshockable in terms of shock-value anything. I'm just waiting for HAG to be torn down and turned into a restaurant where you get dressed up as a baby and these buxom women feed you in a high-chair.  Now that's shock."}
{"text":"This is defiantly a MUST TRY when you are in the Fremont St area of Vegas. The food is really good and the experience is what you will value most. This is one of the most memorable things that I did in Vegas.  The single burger is plenty enough food. They spank you if you don't finish it all. LOL"}
{"text":"Fun. I was with friends for lunch and had a fun time. The decor is fun with quirky faux movie pictures everywhere. The prices were reasonable, and the food was good....good as in ok, acceptable, but it wasn't remarkable. This is on my list as a decent place, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"Not a restaurant I'd typically choose but why the heck not when you're strolling Fremont in downtown Las Vegas. This is definitely a novelty store like a Spencer's, but in this case, for restaurants. The waitresses are dressed as sexy nurses, waiters as doctors, customers as patients, wine hangs from a pouch like an IV right at your table side, and alcohol come in syringes!   The sight is comical but the burgers are serious business. The burgers are huge and nothing short of delicious. However, I wish their menu had more items... Don't expect anything healthy from here. With the name Heart Attack Grill, there is nothing green offered: no lettuce or pickles and definitely no salad! It's a heavy meal so, come with a big appetite to destroy. I could barely finish half of my burger."}
{"text":"First of all, for those people complaining their families didn't care for it, you might rethink taking your kids to Fremont St in 1st place. Those talking about culinary and working in the industry, it's claim to fame is not for being 5 Star dining experience.   Now for the food: lard chili was gross, burger ok but bacon was good. Neat IV filled with wine and booze for mixed drink comes in pill bottle.   Place got a 3 for entertainment factor. Food 1. Wine IV=5."}
{"text":"Fun experience, average food.   NOTE: THIS PLACE IS CASH ONLY.  If you've heard about the Heart Attack Grill you know it's all about the experience, catering to those who enjoy over-the-top gimmicks.  The gimmick is that you are being prepped for some sort of surgical procedure (a bypass if you order a burger). The servers, all females, are dressed in provocative nurses attires, and fit you with a gown before taking you to your table.  The place is decorated with parody movie posters like, \"a few good burgers\" and \"burger nights\", as well as some politically incorrect slogans. 80s music plays while their videos are displayed of several tv's, while other tv's show some silly/campy videos made by the staff.  The menu is pretty simple, burgers, hot dogs, fries, onion rings, and shakes. The only diet drink you'll get here is water, bottled only. Coke product are available in the glass bottles that you don't see around frequently.  The food isn't great, but prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"It was okay at best. Cute idea, but other than that....the hostess \"nurse\" looked like she was on drugs and didn't have a clue what was going on. Rest of the staff was okay. I thought the hamburger was okay. The single was a good size and plenty for me...I liked the bun, but the only choices of topping are chili, onion, tomato, and bacon then you can add mustard, catsup, or mayo. The mayo seemed unsafe since it was just sitting out on the table. My friends who were visiting did not like it at all. The fries were 1/2 fresh and 1/2 old and nasty. Your only choice for drinks is \"regular\" Coke, bottled water, milkshakes made with butter, or alcohol. No bottled beer, all out of a can, etc. It's a touristy place and really not worth it. If you don't finish your food, they paddle you, which I thought was stupid and nobody at our table was having any of that. Lots better food to be had elsewhere. Oh, also it's cash only, which is inconvenient, had to get $ from the ATM and pay a service fee to do it."}
{"text":"Being a burger connoisseur I was not impressed with their offerings, more specifically the quality of the meat. It was not juicy and not very flavorful, I guess here it's more about quantity than quality. I requested extra cheese on my items because I love cheese and was very surprisingly answered with a \"we don't do extra cheese here\" response from our waiter. No extra cheese?!? You cook your food items in lard and yet no extra cheese allowed??? Something was fishy about that. Apparently we just so happened to be served by a cheese nazi because the person who actually brought out our food was more than happy to give us extra cheese. Chili cheese fries were decent, however I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"My friends and I ate here last week, thinking it would be delicious given the concept that everything is unhealthy and fried in lard. I really liked the theme and thought it was cute how they had hospital gowns and everything was hospital themed, but unfortunately... the food was terrible.  The burgers were so overcooked and DRY. It was incredibly difficult to choke down. And you HAVE to finish it or else they spank you. I wasn't worried about that at first because I was super hungry and expecting something delicious, but after I took my first bite, I got a little nervous. I ended up spitting half of it out into my napkin because of how terrible it tasted. (Afterwards, we realized that umm... it's not like they can force you to be spanked. You can just say no. But when you're there, it's intimidating!!)  The fries were nothing special.   It's also very weird that they don't accept credit cards. They take orders on iPhones. It's pretty damn cheap to add a card reader to the iPhone. I don't understand what the big deal is.   Cute idea, but they REALLY need to work on their food. I wouldn't go back and I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"First off atmosphere was great....food was good....a lot going on. I wish they had more of a food selection though. They make u put a gown on while the women are dressed as nurses and the men are dressed nurses too....just not the same. Reminds me of something off a movie. Just let ur stomach get u in trouble. I advise u to eat all ur food....if not you'll get a spanking!"}
{"text":"Yuck: Food and atmosphere. I can't believe this place was featured on television shows or that those shows didn't warn parents not to bring their kids. I saw mortified children cover their eyes as the \"nurse\" administered penis shots to her \"patients.\"  Cruddy menu and cruddy food. How does one mess up a burger and fries? Make it from the cheapest ingredients and serve it like slop. And then punish you for not finishing it."}
{"text":"Pros:  1. Fun experience. 2. Great employees who want you to have a good time. Nurse Lola was awesome. 3. Low prices (my wife and I ate comfortably for around $30).  4. Unreal portions.  Cons:  1. Cash only (but they have an ATM). 2. Food is not good. I ordered the chili dog and it was pretty gross. The fries are shoestring and unseasoned.   If I had to choose again, I would just look in the window, take a pic outside and walk on by."}
{"text":"Came back here after 2 years.. first thing i noticed it was way less crowded then before but alright.. we got a better spot this time.. right next to the spanking area lol.. the burgers were very very good.. but really pricy.. we got 3 single bypass burgers, 1 fries, a coke and a beer and it was about 38 bucks.. inn&out is cheaper and just as good.. but its more the entertainment you pay for... one big big let down.. the bathrooms were dirty AF... Really bad for a restaurant... i still really like this place because i like sadist humor with spanking and the dress up and stuff lol.. i also noticed they opened a new grill at the strip.. i didnt got there yet but since i love freemont decided to go back here."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for a theme restaurant. I have been wanting to visit this place for a while because of their whole gimmick. When you arrive a nurse checks you in, gives you a hospital wrist band, and dresses you in a hospital gown. Seriously, I love a gimmick more than the next person but the Heart Attack Grill is 100% gimmick and only 60% good food. The menu consists of burgers which vary only in the number of patties, french fries fried in lard, shakes, pure sugar coke, and PBR. They have a strict no sharing policy which completely bummed us out because we wanted to order the huge 20 patty burger and split it 3 ways. We ordered 2 single bypass burgers (one of our trio boycotted the burger because of the no sharing policy,) all you can eat lard fries, a vanilla shake, full sugar coke and a PBR. The burgers were ordinary, the fries were ordinary, and the service (aside from being dressed as naughty nurses) was ordinary. The only win was the delicious butterfat filled vanilla shake.   The bill came to around $30, which is a bit pricey because remember only two of us actually had food. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it. It is a gimmick. Heart attack, fat, lard, waitresses dressed as nurses, cook dressed as doctors, sugar, beer...whatever. It gets old pretty fast."}
{"text":"Well I have to say that despite the negative/neutral reviews, I still wanted and needed to check this place out.  I do not like the comparision to Hooters since this place personalize the visit by the gowns and clinic theme  The food, service, atmosphere is awesome and truly highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Il s'agit de l'un des restaurants à visiter à Las Veags.  Possédant une ambiance particulière, vous serez accueillis par des serveuses en tenue d'infermières aux jupes très courtes et aux décolletés très plongeants.  Aux murs ? des parodies d'affiches de films et des spots TV.  Les burgers quant à eux sont très corrects et servis en quantités monstres. En effet, vous pouvez demander une tranche de steak haché et cela peut monter jusqu'à 8 tranches avec du chili ainsi que du bacon et du fromage en quantité!  Un conseil, prenez une pause dans le bon gout et faite vous plaisir au Heart Attack Grill !"}
{"text":"For the uninitiated, the place is called Heart Attack Grill and makes no secret of its active use of lard in everything they make. So for the girls in the audience (yes you, sissy boys who think lard is \"icky\"), this is food meant for people whose genes will still be around in a thousand years.  THE FOOD  I had a double bypass, my buddy had a single bypass and so did my girlfriend. We also shared a basket of fries.  The burgers were as promised, meaty and greasy. There was no lack of cheese and the bun did not fall apart like Carl's Jr. buns always do. There is also no mistake that real meat was used in creation of this diet buster. The double bypass will certainly test the limit of an average person, but it is quite tasty to those of us that do not survive on soy-based diet.   The fries are unquestionably greasy, but are crispy and compare well to most fries out there. I'd certainly choose these over In-n-Out fries.  SETTING  Yes, the girls are scantly clad and keep your wait time pleasurable. Our waitress was quite friendly and spent quite a bit of time talking to us. So I understand why the girls are rating this place poorly.   The place was relatively full when we dropped by at 2 in the afternoon and people ranged from well dressed middle aged couples to never-use-the-shower early 20-somethings. And of course, a couple of drooling teenagers.  I would give higher rating if the hours were more convenient for me.  OVERALL: I can do this once every quarter or whenever I have a friend visiting from out of town. More often and your guts will hate you."}
{"text":"Wanted to try here since I had seen it on tv years ago.  Go here with a lighthearted and fun attitude and you will have fun.  They are over the top with the hospital theme.  But all the waitresses were funny and nice.  Come hungry they paddle u if you don't eat whatever burger u order. Some men folk were not eating their food on purpose to get paddled lol.  The single patty is plenty..and really the size of a decent hamburger you would make at home.  Basic toppings-chili, onion, tomatoe, cheese. I'm a not big person but I was able to eat it just fine, and it was actually pretty good!   For those who down it, hey its not meant to be a place for anyone to eat at everyday.  Also it's greasy food, so measure how much drinking you plan on doing...that will be your downfall. Go hungry!"}
{"text":"So, for the atmosphere I would rate it higher, drinks weren't bad and can have a lot of fun with it! The food was less than good but the fiance loved it. He does however like his burgers dry. I would say go for the experience, but not for the food and we had to asked to be spanked, so that took away from it a little...."}
{"text":"Okay, so the food is alright. Reasonably priced, for two of us we are for $35. Not bad!!!! I gave this one four stars for the experience! We had super fun time here, the spankings are hilarious and the waitstaff is a good time!"}
{"text":"This place sums up America pretty well. I didn't even eat and I threw up. The chili smelled like death and hot breath."}
{"text":"love this place. had the single bypass burger and a shake. it was like i was in heaven. the bacon and cheese was simply amazing. the shake i had was made with 16 percent real butter real. even came with a little piece of butter on top. the beer i got also came in a brown batter bag which i found really funny. the decor is a 80s-90s throwback. love this place. the owner is really nice too."}
{"text":"Came for lunch Saturday, June 9, 2012.  Wow, this place only has a 3-star average?? Let me defend my 4-star rating by saying this is more of an experience than a burger joint.  If I was craving a solid burger in Vegas, I'd be at In N Out.  If I'm with a few friends, esp ones that have not visited this place, I'll be suggesting Heart Attack Grill.  Park in the structure, and carry your ticket with you (to later validate at one of the CASINOS).  As we approached the entrance, I noticed a LOT of large, white folk.  I bet some are from Texas (I've been to Dallas: those portions are fuckin huge. Hm... so was Germany, so maybe there were some German patrons too... but I digress).  Anyway, the point is, I was a little surprised there weren't that many other skinny Asian peeps.  When you enter, a nurse helps you put on a patient gown.  You can take a group shot at that point, and they're happy to oblige.  There is a pretty sweet bar with 6x2 rows of TVs against the wall, a long counter with stool seating parallel to that bar, and scattered tables.  If you're over 350lbs, you can step on the scale in middle of the room to confirm, and you can EAT FREE.  Kinda cool, and disgusting, yet funny.  (It's not all-you-can-eat, but, hey, it's a free meal).  My buddy was the one that led us here that day, and he was out to conquer the quadruple bypass (with 20 strips of bacon).  His girl and I were still hungover from the night before, and we opted to share a single bypass... no, I am not ashamed.  Let me just fast forward and say the fries were way too salty (pass on that), and the butterfat shake was overpoweringly rich (I would totally get it again if I had 3 others to share it with me, as dessert).  My buddy... actually, I should start using his name as he has joined the pantheon of champions, along with Gannicus, Crixus, and Spartacus...  Paul P!  It was a great start, and he had to break the burger down to smaller pieces.  I had warned him not to get the bacon, but he was ambitious.  With only 5 pebble-sized bites left, his girl began to say \"It's Ok Paul, you don't have to finish it...\"  I was furious, and slammed my hand down, \"NO!\"  I insisted he could take it down, \"slow and steady -- only 5 more bites!\"  With resolve, I encouraged him to ignore the naysayers and prove himself.  And slowly, but surely, he finished each bite.  I felt as Rafiki did, watching proudly at Simba ascend the throne!  ... well, he didn't finish the bacon, but that was ok.  If he did, he could have had one of the nurses bring out the wheelchair and wheel him out!  Anyway, it was fun.  Bring friends that will lend support should you, too decide to set upon this path toward greatness.  There are humorous paintings on the walls you can enjoy, while you catch your breath.  You can also have a good chuckle at the urinal -- I won't spoil it for you.  On your way out, you can also check your blood pressure with the automatic cuff they have ;)  Btw, I noticed a few separate people get paddled by a nurse... I think each was all celebrating their birthday.  It was in good fun to watch an elderly lady say \"ouch! That hurts!\""}
{"text":"Don't go for the food, go for the experience!  Whatever you order, eat it quickly, as the lard quickly takes over the taste.  The first few onion rings were delicious.  The nurses were so much fun.  I sang with one (probably very badly) to Tie a Yellow Ribbon - I had already had my \"medication\" (three shots of patron).  Embrace it!  You can even ask for a spanking.  I think you should."}
{"text":"Despite the list of bad reviews and limited stars, I decided to try Heart Attack Grill  anyways for its amazing concept.  Talk about a place with giant weight scales, hospital gowns for its consumers, waitresses in skimpy nurse outfits, XL wheelchairs, witty pop art that grace the walls and an unbelievable shout out to all 350lb heavy-weighters who can dine for free! Sounds like fun... Sounds like Vegas!  With a name like \"HAG\", I'm definitely not dinging them for how much fat is packed into their food.  Coming out of this joint in a state of food-coma and lard oozing out of your pours is a given.  Call me self-righteous, but I'm dinging them because I felt that there was no content that backed their concept.   I would expect that the unhealthiest burger known to mankind would also be the tastiest.. but their claim to fame simply did not meet my expectations.  The burger bun was stale and dry, not even a trace of flavor could be found on the patty and the burger altogether along with the grilled onions, bacon and cheese was a $7 bunch o' bull. Another on my hit list was the fries (deep fried in lard) with cheese and chili.  Again, I have no animosity against the lard.. it was the fact that they had the nerve to call the item \"chili-cheese fries\"!  The chili had the texture of diarrhea and the oil drenched, browned, curdled fries were more saturated in lard then fried.  Once again, not a trace of flavor.  If you are coating your meal with catsup and mustard, you know you have a problem.  Props to their extensive beer line-up, but if you are not into drinking, your only choices are glass bottled coca-cola and/or bottled water which will run you about $3+.    The service was good, quick and easy.. but if you are in a skimpy nurses outfit dressing your patients in hospital gowns, I would've expected a little bit more enthusiasm from the servers as they are constantly bombarded with an array of one-liners from the customers like, \"Hellllloooo Nurse! Do I need to bend down for this examination?\" But they themselves seemed bored out of their minds as if one too many puns came along their way.  Once again.. Flavorless. One and done!"}
{"text":"Great idea, but fail execution.  Well... I don't know about great, but it is certainly an interesting idea. Almost clever.   Going here was my friend's idea - it was either this or get that gastronomical abomination from KFC where they give you a bacon and cheese sandwich and then replace the bread with deep fat fried chicken. I don't like KFC, so I went with this. My choices might as well have been a kick in the face or a stomp on the nuts.  I didn't know what to expect. We walk past the ambulance into the restaurant. The air was thick inside. Oily. I quickly notice that everyone is wearing hospital gowns while devouring their meals. If peopleofwalmart.com was a movie - this would be the cast.   We found ourselves seats and were greeted by a sweet young girl who put a hospital wristband on us and then came around to put on our gowns. The place is staffed with cute girls in nurse costumes. I look down at the menu and the choices are called bypass - the severity varied by how many slabs of meat they put on. It was all kind of fun at first.  I ordered the lightest thing on the menu - a single 1/2 pound burger - also an order of fries (which are unlimited refills) and a water... outside of water, my choices are sugar drinks or beer. My friend ordered a Double Bypass which was a pound of meat, also fries and also beer.   The fries were cooked in lard - they didn't taste too bad, but were not crispy or special at all. They just weren't worth getting up for seconds. Soggy, floppy and flavorless... just something to deliver salt to my stomach.  The burger arrived in a paper tray looking like a sad heap of grease. The bun was glistening - soaked with grease. Butter? Lard? Motor oil? I couldn't be sure, but the first bite told me I didn't want a second. I peeled the top bun from the burger and plopped it in the tray. I attempted to take another bite or two, but couldn't take it. The meat was sub-par shitty, fatty grocery store beef. The cheese was cheap tasting as well.   Not that I expected wine and caviar, but for food this cheap and shit tasting, I wouldn't expect to pay so much.   I didn't eat more than a few bites of the burger and I didn't touch the fries much, but I still felt both full and hungry at the same time. I pretty much just ate a few pickle slices and drank a bottle of water. The waitress asked how I liked it - my friend loved it and said he would've had seconds. I said it was terrible and that I was dissatisfied. I didn't ask for any money off the bill and she didn't offer it either.   Even though I didn't eat it, she charged me 12 bucks or whatever it was. I wasn't entitled to not having to pay or anything - I mean, I ordered it. I should've known what I was getting into. Still, many restaurants would've bent over backwards to make me happy. I can't really bust them down a star for this, but even if I could there's no option for negative stars.   Heart Attack Grill served me one of the worst burgers I've ever had. The novelty of it wore off as soon as my food arrived. If you want to eat an unhealthy yet savory burger/fries meal - go to in'n'out burger.  I will never eat here again. I like greasy food sometimes, but I would rather eat a stick of butter and wash it down with bacon grease. Seriously - fuck this place.   Then again... my friend loved it, so you never know."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun, the menu is limited, and the food is edible.  I would recommend everyone eat here at least once.  You just might get to see a grown man get spanked by a nurse."}
{"text":"We went mostly for the experience. I walked in wearing my in and out burger t-shirt and the young lady at the door berated me for a full minute about wearing it. They were quick though to get us in our gowns and seat us, but we waited and waited and waited for the guy to come take our order or even tell us how things worked. So we had a good deal of time to look at the menu.. I get what they are trying to do at the restaurant but if you really enjoy fresh tomatoes and lettuce on your burger you don't want to eat there. I had a single bypass and a side a fries. The burger just did not have that much taste, maybe I was just missing my tomato and lettuce, but the burger was not juicey and the bun was dry. The fries tasted like they were cooked in really old oil but were better than the burger. Go once for the experiance but just have a shake and skip the burger and fries."}
{"text":"Worse place in the world! My boyfriend weighed in outside the restaurant and was told he would get his meal for free. He met the weight requirement and they told us at the door to tell our server he would get a free burger. The server was not clear at all! She didn't explain the only burger you get is the single and that you had to weigh in before you eat it. They refused to give us a free burger even though we met the requirement. The server did not communicate well and we paid the bill and left very upset! Horrible place! Terrible food"}
{"text":"If you aren't easy big greasy cheeseburgers, cold beer and hot waitresses who really turn on the charm then stay away from this place.  It isn't for those with weak stomaches and narrow minded chain driven people.  A little bit pricey but well worth it."}
{"text":"Garbage place to eat went and had a burger soon enough I was blowing my guts out in the bathroom  save yourself the time and money and don't go to this hot garbage"}
{"text":"I saw this place on the Travel Channel a few years ago and it was in another state. I came to Vegas on my annual trip here and saw they opened one a few years ago and i was pretty stoked cause now i could try them. So my wife, son and I rolled into town last night and my cousins who live in Vegas wanted to try them for the first time and i said \"Sure\".  So we come here and got the gown, sat down and i was scared the food was gonna taste like greasy crap and you know what? It was pretty damn good. The girls were beautiful and the waitress we had was the blonde midget....excuse me, little person, and she was so awesome. Aside from being sexy as hell...she was soooo friendly.   The only thing that really sucks about this place is:  - cash only - they have no kids menu. People do come to Vegas with kids, you know? - the burgers are ala carte...so you gotta order fries with them. - you cant ask for a glass of water because you have to buy bottles of water and cant bring water in. That really sucks. - i really wish the sodas came in refillable glasses. They come in bottles. I really hate when restaurants do that.  But all in all....it was a fun experience and may not be up everyones alley. But i may return next Vegas trip.  Give them a try."}
{"text":"My husband, 6-year old son, friends & their kids ended up eating lunch here last Sunday.    It was a severe \"cheat\" day for my Weight Watchers diet.     On the good side, I LOVED the fries!!!!   I love soft, greasy, skinny, non-crispy not quite cooked french fries....these were SO good!  I couldn't get enough!    First time I had something like that in a really really long time.    Also, it was a fun and unique atmosphere...made you feel OK to eat really, really bad for that one occasion.    I wouldn't recommend bringing kids normally but I like the hosptial aprons for their messes.  On the other side, the burgers were average to below average (the buns were good though) but better than a fast food joint.   I split one wtih my 6-year old son.  Our waitress was very nice and helpful, but if you are a guy looking for some super artificial hot chics to serve you (I'm not) then you're at the wrong place.  Its one of those places that you do once to say you went and that's it.   I don't know that I would visit again unless I was taking out of town guests that really wanted to go."}
{"text":"We had so much fun at this restaurant! When we travel on vacation, we always like to stop at restaurants that are off the beaten path or ones that we've seen on tv and definitely ones that are fun and unique. This one fit the bill exactly! From the moment we walked in and got our hospital gowns on, yep! Hospital gowns, to the moment we walked out, we laughed, joked, and smiled AND! ate great food. We ordered \"light\" because we didn't want to get spanked (you read that right) for not finishing our food. I know! We're cowards! But! We enjoyed watching other patrons being on the receiving end of the paddle:) As a bonus, all of the servers and bartender were super friendly (and too cute), and we loved the nurses outfits! Additionally, we met and got a selfie with the owner. Fun, fun! Oh, and for you big kids out there, anyone over 350# eats for free. We witnessed that, too! All in all a great time!!"}
{"text":"You can come here and get a butterfat milk shake topped with pats of butter and a hamburger that clocks in at 4,000 calories.  They let people that are over 350 pounds eat for free.  There's a scale in front to prove it.  That's the kind of place this is.    The waitstaff and hostesses dress like nurses, and you're forced to wear a surgical gown and endur fat/emergency room/heart attack themed humor while you eat.  Think Dick's Last Resort in an emergency room.  Yeah, you have the idea.  It's a gimmick, it's in the middle of a gimmicky location in a gimmicky city, but there's something about it that still made me want to go in, take pictures and order a ridiculously unhealthy milk shake so I could take pictures, tell friends, and then move on."}
{"text":"My friend sent me a link about this place back in February and like most patrons, I thought it was a catchy yet ridiculous idea. Boastfully serving the \"unhealthiest\" food around? What an outrageous concept.    BUT BUT BUT but BUT   \"Outrageous\", in this case, is not used as a positive attributive. My bf and I came to Phoenix to visit some friends during spring break and decided to see what the hoopla was about. Heart Attack Grill is merely a novelty eatery, much like Hooters. The service was pretty average. Our server was nice but I noticed the others hardly smiled at or greeted their guests. The fries (fried in pure lard) were pretty dry for my liking. The \"single-bypass\" burger was very greasy and cheesy (the way I like them) but other than that, it was pretty bland. I did like their coke and it has been a while since I've had coke out of an actual Coca-Cola bottle.   The place was pretty dead and I found it odd how there was no cash register. You have to pay cash only and the cash is put into a little bag like they're selling candy door to door or something. WTF?   The service was pretty mediocre but it wasn't like I was expecting the waitresses to say, \"Would you like to die faster?\"   I mean, maybe my expectations were too high (for what? You may ask. HELL IF I KNOW) but if I'm going to be doing the digestive equivalent to a double-murder-suicide and clogging my arteries, I at least want to do it joyously! However, anything \"joyous\" as it pertains to Heart Attack Grill falls way off the radar.   *shrug*  and now a lone star hangs over Heart Attack Grill."}
{"text":"Heart Attack Grill is definitely for the hungry that can finish a burger of enormous proportions, while they do offer burgers in a single, it is still pretty big and they don't use traditional small hamburger buns. The concept of this place is pretty neat, as there are nurses that serve you and they have movies in parodies with nurses and doctors. The doctors are bartenders, they have nurses that sing, and dress you before you come in, in a patient gown. There is a rule here where you are supposed to finish all your food, or the nurse gets to spank you 3 times with a small paddle, and from looking at some that endured the slaps, they are soft pats on the ass haha.   They have beer, wine, hot dogs, shakes and burgers, I think wine or something comes in a syringe which is pretty cool. All their burgers are pretty standard, patty, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cheese, and you can take whatever you don't want out, and add 5 slices of bacon for an additional charge. The burgers also come normally with chili. Anyone over 350lbs gets to eat here for free, staff is nice and they have a decent selection of beers.  There's also a scale outside that is inaccurate, but cool to take pictures if you'd like with friends or by yourself."}
{"text":"I can't believe I never wrote a review for this place since I was so angry eating here. I will throw out the whole concept, and strange hospital gown you have to wear.  1. The service is horrible!! Horrible! Horrible!! The waitresses are mean, unhelpful, obviously hate their jobs other than the part where they get to spank people. (The only actual smile the waitresses had)  2. The prices are high! with extremely low quality food.  3. I got the single bypass with bacon and chili and the burger was as extremely overdone and the chili had the consistency of diarrhea with the taste of blended Walmart brand chili while the fries were soggier than I thought possible.They also only serve bottled drinks here. So no you can't have a glass of water.   Within 20 of eating here my entire group of 8 people had to run to the Golden Nugget to take emergency dumps!   Why would you go here!! Don't GO HERE! STOP!! If you are in Fremont right now and looking at this review! Save your money and just take a cab to In N Out!  oh yeah Cash only here! wtf why would a newer sit down restaurant be Cash Only! Get a Square or Paypal reader! Yes complaining about cash only is fair because it shows what a greasy cheap under the table establishment this is.(oh bookkeeping and 3% is too expensive for this obvious cheaply ran place)  That is an inconvenience as someone that messaged me complained about this review. Cash only businesses don't get called out as a negative if the meal is less than $10 or an exceptional mom and pop shop; this place is clearly neither. Very easily one of the top 5 worst businesses I have ever reviewed."}
{"text":"You should try it just to say you have been there and done that.  Food not so good - they only have the burgers and fries.  The waitress we had was very nice and it can be a fun environment for some - once you've been though you most likely wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"This is definitely a novelty place. And as far as novelty restaurants go, it's a great one! It's definitely an experience eating here. Every customer has to put on a hospital gown to enter. All the employees are either dressed as nurses or doctors. When you look around and see everyone consistently dressed as if they're in a hospital, it really gives you that novelty experience.  If you don't finish your food, you get spanked by a waitress with a wooden paddle. And they hit HARD! I was expecting it to be a cute little tap, but they really do wack you. The fact that you _have_ to get a ton of food and are actually thinking about the fact that you will be spanked if you don't finish is definitely a unique experience.  It's also fun when a 350+ pound person gets up on the scale in the middle of the restaurant to get a free burger, and everyone cheers.  I just got a single bypass with extra bacon and fries, and was a bit underwhelmed. The taste wasn't distinguishable. It tasted like an average burger and fries. I tried some of my friends chili though, and that had some good flavor.  Note: to my surprise, there were a lot of families/kids around. I was confused about what the kids could eat - a full half pound burger seems like too much - but they let the kids share and I suppose it's a fun place for a kid to be.  Conclusion: Clearly it takes a certain type of person to enjoy this atmosphere. I'm going to assume that you're that kind of person (otherwise, why would you be reading this). With that assumption, I think this is a good choice if you want an experience to remember."}
{"text":"I want to give this place 5 stars, because I thought the gimmick was hilarious. I love the decor, love the menu (all the details cracked me up!) That being said... The burger was killer. I had a double and it was amazing!!! Ordered fries... Huge mistake. Nasty, slimy, limp, old fries. Yuck. Ordered a chocolate shake with vodka. That was awesome! And then... I vomited. Like expelled my tasty burger and nasty fires and mediocre shake. Now that I've read the reviews, I see I'm not the only one that has happened to, after consuming one, with or without the alcohol. I am no stranger to a little booze and since it was my first and only drink of the night, it wasn't the vodka's fault! I'm saying, the shake did it."}
{"text":"Ordered the 4x4, minus the 20 slices of bacon, just for fun.  It was surprising good...and the chili was bomb-digity! Loved watching my bro-in-law get paddled! A must do tourist attraction if visiting Downtown L.V."}
{"text":"We went for lunch last week after walking by at night a couple of nights before. It is definitely more popular at night, but still a fun place to go for lunch. My partner and I shared an order of onion rings and I got the single bypass burger. Boy, I was full! Paired it with a black cherry soda and I was content. Their shakes looked delicious and they serve shots in syringes and pill bottles! If you check into yelp you get some spanks from the nurses, which is fun to watch."}
{"text":"Decided to meet some friends today for lunch...and frankly, heard enough about it to make me want to try it.  Really, the only thing that earned the stars for me was the waitress.  She was funny, just engaging enough, and she actually made me feel as if she was interested in talking to me.  The fries were okay - but unlike the other reviews, I didn't taste much in them.  I'm okay with a meal like this (blatantly unhealhy) once in a while...but this really wasn't worth the trouble.  Maybe I am spoiled, but the burger was tasteless and the bun was soaked in butter but not toasted.  I really enjoy Diet Coke with any meal (I know, I know...not unhealthy) and had to settle for water.  The fries were not cooked through (you know, when they are hard in the middle but soft on the outside)...and just not worth it.  And, really, I hate the \"cash only\" places.  I'll skip it next time."}
{"text":"Loved this place!!! The girls are awesome/hilarious and the milkshakes are awesome! And Stephanie is THE BEST!"}
{"text":"I took two vacation days off from work to visit Phoenix for the first time with a friend. Our primary objective for this trip was mostly to visit Heart Attack Grill. I became intrigued after hearing about it from various people and watched videos on Youtube about it.  Anyway, the day after we arrived, we drove to Chandler to find the place. We entered the restaurant just a little after 11am, and were greeted by the waitresses. After sitting down, both of us ordered the Quadruple Bypass burger, which is 4 half-pound patties, 4 slices of american-cheese with lard spread on the buns. In addition, we ordered the limitless fries (which are cooked in lard), and 2 Mexican cokes (which are created using real cane sugar). We were also compelled to don \"medical gowns\" as part of our stay and given wristbands. It's pretty silly but the over-the-top-ness of it all was pretty cool.  The fries were great. Crispy and nicely salted, the prior knowledge of it being cooked in lard was not a deterrent; rather I was looking forward to food tasting better with more fat and grease involved.   The burger arrived not too long after finishing my first set of fries. It smelled great and glistened with grease, oil, and fat. I was disappointed that it did not come with any bacon. Maybe this is added by request but I did not see this option either on the menu or on the pictures of the burgers which adorn the walls.  The burger required a strategy in order to eat. There was simply no way to just pick it up and eat it as is. After picking up some additional ingredients (onions, ketchup, mustard, tomatoes), and splitting the burger in half I began feasting away. The meat was delicious and cooked perfectly, and the melted cheese and added condiments/ingredients supplemented the flavor of the meat without being overwhelming. I did finish the burger eventually, but by the time I hit the halfway mark I was slowing down, visibly sweating from the grease, and everything started to taste like meat; even the Coke!  I should note that by noon-time, the restaurant was packed full and there were people from all walks of life: the elderly, people in business casual attire, construction workers, etc. I also noticed that none of these people other than my friend and I had anything bigger than a single and the limitless fries.  This is probably the best way to go if you are regular here. I thought the burger was great but like everything else in life; overdoing a good thing only makes it bad. No points deducted for this at all because it was my first time in Phoenix and I probably won't be back for a while but the Quadruple Bypass was something to be tried.  After finishing we paid our bill (Heart Attack Grill only accepts cash), took pictures with our \"nurse\" and Dr. Jon (the owner), and we were both wheeled out to our car in the lot.  Heart Attack Grill is not meant to be taken seriously at all. In fact, they deliberately tell you that it's not good for you. In the end it's the consumer that makes their choice as they walk through that door to sit down for their meal. I thought the food was great for the price (so long as you don't do anything bigger than a double and hurt yourself), and the staff was very friendly. This is worth a return visit the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"First timer. Environment was ok but the reason for the rating is my burger was dry and not much flavor for $10. Wait staff was nice"}
{"text":"This place is fun to hangout at with friends. Food is ok. I am not a big fan of burgers. I wanted a hot dog but I know i wouldn't finish it, so I had water and enjoyed just being with my friends. I took a bite of the partners burger and it was tasty. I enjoyed watching everyone get spanked for not eating their food more than anything, lol ... Place was very busy and smack in the middle of downtown Vegas. Our two waitress were friendly and right down awesomeness :) One thing is that it is definitely a bit to noisy for me ..."}
{"text":"What a difference 3 years makes, I remember the first time I came here being incredibly being underwhelmed even though it's just a novelty place that makes bacon burgers. Before last week I would have settled on a burger from del Taco before I ate here again, but on the suggestion of my friend (who was having his birthday that weekend) I gave the heart attack grill another chance. I don't know what if anything they changed but the food had a lot more flavor this time. For something that purposely cooked in a bunch of lard for the sake of adding a ton of calories the burgers were pretty damn good this time around. Even the chili was good, which I found a bit odd because it looks like the generic chili that wouldn't have a bland sodium flavor but it made the burgers & fries even better.  That being said this is no way a \"must go\" whenever I come to visit Vegas, but I won't turn down the idea if some else suggest coming back for a double bypass burger."}
{"text":"The Gowns they make you wear might be their fun marketing gimmick but when you step out of the 100 degree heat the last thing you want is another layer of clothing. Burger was mediocre and the chili was aweful!! Not a Fan."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?  Seriously.  If you like less than mediocre food while porn is being thrown in your face, you'll find it here.  Seriously.  We never would have gone in here if we had any idea.  Seriously.  Corporate Suits in town wanted to take a few folks from my office to lunch and chose this place.  There's an hour of my life I'll never get back.  Seriously.  This place makes Hooters look very upscale and classy.  Seriously.    And the food.  Huge burgers and fries are the only choices.  The burgers?  Think Encore Frozen Salisbury Steaks on a bun.  Seriously.  We left with the unanimous agreement that none of us would ever see the inside of this place again.    Seriously."}
{"text":"\"Fighting Anorexia Since 2005\".  Yeah, it's a themed restaurant that built its name on serving wildly unhealthy food.  You are required to wear a hospital gown (keep your clothes on thank you very much).  You will be served by well endowed \"nurses\" in all shapes and sizes but guaranteed to be curvaceous.  Don't finish, bend over and prepare to be paddled HARD (thought the board was gonna break with that whack).   Guys or ladies, it doesn't matter.  Punishment is dished out to both as the entire restaurant looks on, phones in hand.  On all the monitors, re-imagined hilarious karaoke vids of 80's classics.  Here's the catch, much of the food is natural and no more unhealthy than what you'd get in a fast food restaurant.  It just taste a lot better.   Burgers are very good.  Well cooked and seasoned ground beef with no additives, topped with a decent chili, fresh onions, tomatoes, and a slice of cheddar.  Fresh, soft potato bun able to hold it all together through the entire feasting.   All soda (Coke, 7up, or Dr. Pepper) are imported from Mexico and use 100% cane sugar. Milkshakes are made from all natural ingredients (including a pat of butter).  Want bacon, $0.92 for five strips on the single burger.  Burgers offered from one to eight patties (five to 40 strips of bacon).  Prices range from just over $10 - $30.  Outstanding fries and onion rings.  Both deep fried in lard for that extra crispy exterior.  Notes:  -- Sharing allowed only on the single. -- 1/2lb hotdog the only non burger item. -- If you weigh more than 350lbs, you eat free. -- Cash only. -- Vegan menu available (a pack of non filtered lucky strike cigarettes). * Three free spankings with yelp check-in.  Tip:  guys use the restroom.  There's something oddly satisfying about taking a leak on the face of... just go.   Don't knock it till you try it.  A great place to take any visitor to the wackiness that is Freemont Street."}
{"text":"The heart attack grill has been on my bucket list since I booked Vegas. My boyfriend and I decided to go on our last full day and it was so much fun! I am a huge fan of themed restaurants? so I definitely? enjoyed wearing a hospital gown and having the waitresses dressed up as nurses. My boyfriend ordered the octuple (largest) burger on the menu! IT WAS INSANE. I was surprised not many people order it cause when it came out everyone in the restaurant? went crazy. They say you get spanked if you don't finish your burger but that did not happen when we did not finish ours? One downfall was we were asking the waitress what drinks are good and she was not very helpful. It would have been nice to know wine was served in a IV bag, but she did not tell me so I ordered a frozen drink that came with the shot on the side in a pill bottle. I wish I ordered the wine but I did not know until a customer next to us had ordered that. Overall the food and staff are decent but the atmosphere is pretty cool! I recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"Heart Attack Grill is a hamburger joint with a zany parallel universe hospital theme.  Waitresses dress in somewhat provocative nurse outfits (The type of nurse outfits you'll see in fantasy playbacks in movies with everything all boosted up and sticking out).  Following the theme, each customer is required to wear hospital gowns upon entrance.  Their burger is eloquently named the \"bypass\" and depending on the number of patties it'll be the single, double, triple, quadruple (more if you'd like...) \"bypass\".    When a place is called heart attack anything, it is a strong red flag that a vegetarian option may be out of the question.  Parodied movie posters are plastered all over the walls.  While I'm no Jason Bourne, I always do a scan of any place I go too before settling in my seat.  Here my sights stopped on a rather large scale.  Above the scale was an indicator pronouncing whoever weighs 350 lbs, WILL EAT FREE!  First off, if you weigh that much, eating here may be hazardous to your health.  I was lucky enough to see a fellow customer climb onto that scale and \"win\" a free meal.  Sirens went off with applause following.    A close buddy from L.A. had been talking about trying this place out on a couple occasions.  The three of us looking at menus in hospital gowns was a sight to see.  After a couple chuckles we ordered.  The smallest of the group ended up ordering the triple bypass while I chickened out and got the double.  We all shared a side of chili cheese fries which could have fed five or more easily.  Sizes are massive and while I did finish most of it; I don't think it was a particularly good idea.  Splicing chili on top of each burger patty inserted another layer of taste to a burger that consisted mainly of overly greasy meat flavor.  Take out the notion I was clogging my arteries at an exponential rate after each bite, the burger was ok.      The novelty of it all is an experience in itself.  Seeing a couple Japanese tourists being spanked by the nurse waitresses is another interesting sight.  Rule is if you don't finish, you get spanked.  I'm assuming this was optional since any normal human would assuredly have trouble finishing these burgers and not everyone got spanked.  Aligning their extreme gimmick with the same motto of a more adult Hooter's equating to more show than emphasis on food, Heart Attack Grill is worth at least ONE visit.  I don't know about a second.  My heart may not be able to handle it."}
{"text":"The one star is for the paintings on the wall, the other is for the poor women that work here. This place sucks. The \"cheese\" on the burger is processed American cheese. The burger is a small step up from McDonalds. Want some water, nothing is free here, you have to buy a bottle. 3 Wifi networks, can I use one of them? Nope. Keep walking tourists, nothing to see here."}
{"text":"As with a lot of people, I found out about this place through the Travel Channel and made it a point to come and experience the awesomeness that is the Heart Attack Grill. My brief stay in Arizona, I couldn't pass up the chance.  My first visit was...well...ok. Nothing amazing to say the least but did bring a smile 'cause it was THE Heart Attack Grill.   Burger - was actually pretty good. I got the double-bypass cheese burger which I killed in 10mins. Should have gotten the triple. It came nicely put together and I added tomato, pickles, red onions, and mustard  Fries - ....eh. sounds amazing fried in lard, but was under par for me. was kinda limp, wasn't crispy and i think the few batches that were in the tray were over cooked. loved the fry bar concept though.  Experience - wasn't as expected, granted that we went for lunch on a Tues, the waitresses weren't exactly \"hot\" (like on TV...LOL) they were very friendly and attentive tho. I would think the best times would be more the weekends. if you want that experience and \"eye-candy\"  if you love burgers...like experiencing themed places. definitely check this place out at least once. i hope to return one day... on a weekend.  My overall, rating is 3.5 stars. :)"}
{"text":"On the surface this place is everything I hate. Brainless, hot waitresses in scanty nurse get ups, food that is frighteningly high in fat and calories, marginal 80's music videos playing, customers wearing hospital smocks, shakes with butter on top, fat bastards getting free meals. Sounds like a cheese ball train wreck to me. But alas, I was talked into going here last night and have to say my prejudgment was wrong.   Let's start with the waitresses. As a Vegas resident, hot waitresses are all over the place, and do not entice me to eat somewhere. Don't get me wrong I love checking out hotness as much as the next guy. I just think it's usually kind of a cheap gimmick to get business. The gals here though are quite personable and some are pretty funny on how they present the whole concept of the unhealthiness of this place. They celebrate what they offer, with humor. So it does not come off as tacky sluts serving food...it comes off more smart, cute and personable. Service was fast and we were asked 2-3 times if we needed anything. They text their orders in too which is kind of cool.  The food. Man, some of this stuff sounds pretty disgusting. The onions are sautéed in pig lard. The fries are fresh cut and fried in lard. Both are full of rich flavor. If you demand crisp fries, it ain't happening here....but they are delish. The buns are fresh and come from a local bakery. The meat is 19% fat and comes from locally owned Larry's Meat Market. I like the fact that they incorporate local businesses in their business model. I had a chance to speak with the owner, Dr. John, that's where I'm getting this info, the guy is a marketing genius IMO. The burgers are certainly better than most places too.  I like malts and shakes...usually a nice chocolate malt over a shake. We were served a sample of the chocolate shake (sans the pat of butter on top) and I have to say it was one of the best chocolate shakes I have EVER had...seriously. Rich and VERY chocolately.  What I thought would be silly, tourist trap, douche city turned out to be a fun, delicious surprise. Trust me, I'm a little embarrassed to admit it, but I did indeed like this place."}
{"text":"Heart attack grill offers a simple menu of burgers ranging from the Single Bypass Burger through the wheelchair-to-car-included Triple Bypass Burger and the unlisted Quadruple Bypass Burger.  In theory you could get your leftovers to go (and you will have leftovers) but in practice the staff recommends against this.  The single bypass burger is more burger than you care to eat.  Price is by burger size and includes lard-fried fries and a beer or soda, as well as taxes figured up front..  The burgers are tasty, with lots of fixings (onion, lettuce, tomoto, special sauce, bacon, ...) but if you come here for the food you're missing the point.  Waitstaff are dressed in slinky nurse's outfits, the gimmick of this prototype of what will prove to be a successful franchise business."}
{"text":"First of all, you have to go to this restaurant for the entertainment factor.  Nobody goes to Disneyland for the great hot dogs right?  You go to this restaurant for the fun factor.    The food is a bit expensive for what you get, but considering the experience I'd honestly pay double.  They only accept cash, they offer wine in an IV bag and cheap beer straight from the 24 ounce can!  The food is very basic: hamburgers, hot dogs, milk shakes, fries, beer, and cheap wine.  If you weigh 350 pounds or more, you get your hamburger and fries for free.  When you walk in the door, you are \"checked in\" to the hospital with a hospital admission wrist band and a hospital gown.  All of the staff are very pretty women dressed as sexy nurses.  The sexy isn't over the top, so there were a lot of kids there.  You're seated, place your order, then your food arrives pretty quickly.   We ordered two of their standard hamburgers (one way bypass) with fries and a PBR.  I think our bill was around $30.  You'll be plenty full after your meal because everything is made without worrying about calories.  If you don't finish your food, your waitress will ask you to move to the center of the restaurant for a spanking in front of everyone with a wooden paddle.  Of course, you can decline.  The waitress prepared to paddle my wife and I yelled \"spank her hard!\"  She was spanked normally just like everyone else.  When it was my turn, the waitress insisted on spanking me 3 times.  I'm certain that our waitress played softball or tennis because she damn near broke the paddle on my butt.   The manager (I think her name is Tracy) was so nice to us, and chatted with us during our entire meal.  We had a terrific time and we'll certainly go back next time we are in Vegas.  By the way, this is Vegas.  If you are in Vegas, I hope you have a sense of humor.  It's a town where trucks with billboards drive up and down the strip offering \"girls to your room tonight,\" the casinos are filled with smoke, and people hemorrhage their life savings every day.  Heart Attack Grill is a nice break from all of that.  It's just basic American greasy food served by sexy nurses who spank you with a wooden paddle if you don't finish your meal.  So, go to the Heart Attack Grill- and ask for Tracie.  Tell her that you want one of her special pina colada jello shots.  Trust me, you'll laugh until you cry.  Get a burger, try to finish it... or don't try, if you're into that."}
{"text":"Really sad to see the move from Chandler didn't improve the ambiance.  A very poor copy of the original.  A bike chain across the entrance started the experience off on a bad foot.  The place just looked run down.  I miss the all you can eat fry bar and the fresh veggies to put on your own burger.  There's enough room...  Where's the \"stage\" with the bar around it to watch the nurses?  This is Vegas and it is lacking the glitz."}
{"text":"One of the WORST experiences of my life.  My friends and I decided to go and check this place out as the local radio kept talking about it.  So the day we decide to go, the guy from the Colbert report was there mocking the restaurant also.  We go in and we thought, \"hey wow, this is kinda cool\" as they talked about monster proportions of burgers and fries fried in lard.  However, once the food arrived we sat down and although the wait staff was scantily clad, all of them had \"cottage cheese\" legs and thighs.  We sat down, and my friend decides to take their super burger challenge, she said if he finished his 2 lbs burger, his meal would be on the house.  He kills it, and when we ask why his burger wasn't free, we could no longer find out waitress and the owner says to us \"you either pay or i come over the counter\" he threatened us with violence, which is stupid as all we were doing was asking what about what the waitress had told us.  We will never ever go there again.  Being Asian, he also spewed racial slurs at us, calling us to go back to where we came from.  ALL of us were born and raised in Arizona so I don't know where we would go.  Anyways, don't go here.    Also, all of the patrons, ALL of them were middle aged men, who instead of paying attention to their wives and kids were hiding away at a nasty restaurant who's burgers aren't even really grilled.  the frozen patties from costco are placed on a machine that rolls the burgers through, so you can't even want a medium burger, they are all torched.  The fries although fried in lard, are crap.  All in all, if you're a lonely loser, this is the place for you.  If you're a classy kinda guy that wants REAL food, go to any other generic burger place and you will be more satisfied."}
{"text":"If and when I have friends in town that don't come to Vegas much I always ask them if they have ever eaten at Heart Attack Grill and whether they have or not I take them and one of them always manages to be the one not to eat everything so he or she gets a special treat at the end which is something we all talk about til this day!! Awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Food= no  But total experience =yes, the patient gowns and fear of getting spanking for not eating all your food makes it a good time. Not coming back though hahahah"}
{"text":"Theming was accurate however security manager was overly uptight and not accommodating in the smallest sense. Alerted the manager who also had zero desire to understand or correct the issue."}
{"text":"high expectations.. very much let down. if you're going to have one item on your menu you better make it damn well and both their burger and fries were disappointing, not to mention the really expensive prices. the only thing that kept me from giving this place one star was the experience I have to say it does have a unique atmosphere."}
{"text":"I don't splurge very often but when I do...I do it right.  If I'm going to have a cheeseburger, fries and a shake then I'm coming here.   Nowhere else can you enter and be given a pair of scrubs to wear and not have to worry about spilling anything on your clothes.  The burgers are amazing, fries are amazing and the shakes are on point.    After enjoying my meal I got a cute little nurse (server) to come give me a spanking with a big wooden stick.  It was worth it!!!  I also witnessed a rather large gentleman get weighed and then eat for free because he was over 350 lbs.    This place is fun and it's located in a great area on the corner of Fremont and Las Vegas blvd."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great!! I enjoyed the food and the service!!! So much to look at as a tourist! Can't forget about the videos!!! They have the servers in them which is great to watch!"}
{"text":"This is a must do in Vegas! It was so fun!! You walk in and the Doctor dresses you in a hospital gown. You are then seated by one of the beautiful nurses. I ordered the single bypass burger, butter fat milkshake and a shot of penisillin. My nurse had to administer the penisillin for me. Unfortunately, I was unable to finish my burger, so my nurse got out the paddle and gave me three spankings. This place is so fun! Don't go if you're a prude that doesn't want to see plastic penis's, Obama in the urinal or people getting spanked. Its all in good fun and we had the BEST time! :D"}
{"text":"I and my gf arrived around 7pm and a Wednesday night. We got greeted immediately and the hostess moved is to our table. The place was half full but we didn't get our order in until around 30 minutes later. We were hungry and haven't had a proper meal to whole day.  We decided to shared a single bypass and a side of fried and saved room for our stomach for a nice steak nearby. Our order arrived to our table fairly promoted. The visual presentation was unattractive. The fried were clearly old and had left out for awhile since it tasted soggy and not crunchy. The single bypass, the bread was half flatten and the patty was dried and over cooked. We felt the burger was cooked by mistake previously and had left on the side for awhile and had it served to us since we decided to shared. The reason being is on the way out, we noticed the other customers' bread was visually looking way better than our. My gf had stomach problem half an hour after we ate and I also felt some discomfort on my tummy.  I'm very disappointed since the first time I went to this exact place, I ordered a double by pass and fried, both were supreme. I was excitedly told my gf about this place and it was a big disappointment to her and my self. We lost our appetite and bloated with stomach issue after eaten here.   I will not come back."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is good as is the staff. The burgers, not at all what we expected. Every part of it was cold from the patty to the mass of bacon and unmelted cheese. Didnt care for the fries either. Onion rings and shakes were very good though."}
{"text":"4 for the experience. 3 for the food.   -------  Sure it's kitschy. Catering to the hefty hearts of the typical American, Heart Attack Grill offers a free meal for those over 350 pounds. In fact, they've got livestock scales in front and inside the restaurant for those up to the task. With servers dressed as scantily clad nurses and the owner, Jon Basso, dressed as a \"physician\" prescribing \"nutritional pornography,\" it's essentially Vegas personified.   So while touring Freemont Street, I couldn't help but stop by with the GF's family. I mean c'mon. The Last Supper depicted by America's favorite fast food icons? Consider me sold and uptight cynics be damned.  Single Bypass Burger [$8.33]  The GF went with the single bypass burger, which was surprisingly decent. While the cheese could have been melted better and the bun was a bit tough and flour-dusted, the beef was well-seasoned, with the chili sauce making each bite.   Double Bypass Burger [$10.18] + 10 Bacon Slices [$1.85]  I went with the double bypass burger, along with 10 \"slices\" of bacon. While the cheese could have been melted better on this burger as well, the chili sauce helped to make each bite nicely juicy.   Fries [$4.63]  The matchstick fries were good - crispy and well-seasoned.    Onion Rings [$6.48]  The onion rings were heart stoppers - literally. Deep-fried in pure-lard, they had a nicely crisp beer batter crust.  The seemingly sweet servers? Not so sweet if you don't finish your meal. The punishment? They get to spank you three times in front of the entire restaurant. I kid you not, these are not light swats.   How do I know this? I finished my meal just fine. But after a trip to the restroom, I saw the rest of my party's meals somehow placed in front of my seat. With a twinkle in her eye, our server called out or me while patting her paddle. Let me tell you, I felt it the rest of the day.   So if you're by Freemont Street, looking for an experience, and aren't uptight about life in general, check out Heart Attack Grill. It's not about the food, though surprisingly, it wasn't half bad. Rather, it's about living a little and trying something wacky. Or getting whacked."}
{"text":"Surprised with the originality of this place !!!. Excellent costumer service. This guys know that if you come to Vegas you want to be treated like a king and have fun as well. Definitely a point to visit in Vegas"}
{"text":"I went here based on the things I saw on TV for the arizona one, and it was not the same. It is the Heart Attack Grill Vegas style, but even then I was expecting something more.  It did not have the cheese sauce I heard about, the waitresses were cute, but not pinuppy (I am a rockabilly so I take my pinup seriously).  The burgers were good.  They all come out medium rare, so if you do not like pink then fair warning.  Overall I would say go here only to say you went here.  If you need a good burger, for a better value, then head to Fuddruckers."}
{"text":"The food was yummy, bad for you, and greasy, but not many choices here. It is however a fun experience and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ok OK; we went in knowing it is a tourist trap. But the food could still be better. The meat wasn't seasoned for our burgers (if it was we couldn't tell) The French fries were probably out of a box and fried in lard but no salt......But hey! our Cokes were cold! I tried the hot dog, problem is the chili was so so, and no heat to it. The dog itself was decent but the bun coulda woulda shoulda be smaller or toasted or something. The girls were kinda lackluster but maybe it was because we went on a Sunday. There just wasn't a lot of personality in the room and isn't that what makes a tourist restaurant a place locals want to go too? The best part was checking out the posters with my 20 year old daughter and laughing at how the adapted them.  Take guests you aren't worried about impressing or a family member you are getting back at in a good way ;)"}
{"text":"All of the bad reviews confuse me.. I expected a ridiculously cheesy, over the top, fat-laden meal.. and that is what I got! Yup, its' gimmicky, yup, it's high calories, but I feel like all of that should come as no surprise!   I think the \"theme\" if you will is entertaining and fun. Wearing a hospital gown was pretty funny (you get to keep it if you let the nurses spank you!), watching the nurses dole out spankings was pretty hilarious, and I loved how the bill had \"medical procedures rendered\" printed on it.   Our service was great. Friendly nurse. Food came relatively quickly. No complaints!  We started our meal with the chocolate butter cream shake and added a \"shot\" of whipped cream vodka. It turns out the \"shot\" was actually 3.5 shots, thus earning the drink the title of \"strongest frozen drink on Fremont\". I don't know if they really are the strongest drink on Fremont, but I do know it was the TASTIEST frozen drink on Fremont. If you are childish enough to enjoy whipped cream vodka (I am!), then you will definitely appreciate the delicious combination! There was no pat of butter in my shake (which was fine by me).   We split the single bypass (1/2 pound) and an order of fries. I LOVE that they cook their fries in lard (as all fries should be cooked!), and damn were they delicious. Perfectly crisp. The burger was very good as well. Definitely not \"best burger in Vegas\" material, but a great burger.   Overall, please don't come here if you don't have a sense of humor and don't enjoy high fat food. The food tastes much better if you are drunk - in fact eating a burger wearing a hospital gown should probably only be done while intoxicated."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would have.  We had a group of 40 people for company get together at Fremont Street Heart Attack Grill.  As soon as our Host walked up to the Heart Attack Grill Host say she cant seat 40 people.  Our host told the host at the restaurant she can seat how many she can at once that we don't have to all sit together. The girl then said she will not be able to serve us.  So my boss the owner of the company walked in ^ tried to get seats & he was starting to get upset because the host was ignoring him.  So he asked if she spoke english since she was ignoring him.  That was wrong of him but he was frustrated at this point.  The host of Heart Attack Grill proceeded to say that she does & that we are disrespectful & refuses to seat us & has every right to,  So we told her fine that she just lost alot a money & we walked out.  I thought about it & went back in to ask for the manager contact info & the girls name that refused us service.  The security stepped in between & told her not to respond.  She told me she has the right to refuse service to who she wants & I told her \"Yes, you do have the right to refuse service to us or anyone else, but I also have the right to file complaint with your  management\" Needless to say she refused to give up any info about the manager or owner info or her name. As a person that runs a company customer service is #1 & the host provided bad customer service from the start.  And turning away 40 people for no reason other than they cant seat them together is a joke. Especially when we told her she can seat everyone separate, & that we don't have to be seated all at once. It was going to be my first time at Heart Attack Grill, but I will never step foot in that business just from this one experience.  I could just imagine how the service would have been if we would have got inside.  Needless to say we got in Micky Finn's Restaurant & Bar right away and they put us all together & their service was great!  SO if you think about Heart Attack Grill for food, go across the way to Mickey Finn's for better, food, & service"}
{"text":"Love the idea, hated the food. my wife and I had a great time from the hospital gowns to the little person nurse who was spanking customers with the wooden paddle. This place was packed and everyone should come to this place once for the experience.  The crappy thing is the food was nasty. Obviously it was greasy etc but it really just did not taste good. I had a single bypass, fries and a shake. The burger was difficult for me to eat just because not only was it greasy but the flavor of the meat was bland. I guess my point is if you're going to give me a heart attack I should at least enjoy the food.  The shake had a big slice of butter on top and despite my expectations I just could not finish it.   I made sure to show the waitress/nurse that we didn't eat the food so we could get the spanking we deserved. They took it easy on us at us at first but then they got us good with the wooden paddle. The overall experience was awesome and worth the $ even though the food sucked."}
{"text":"This place is crazy, and we all need a bit of crazy, especially in Vegas. Where else do you dress in hospital gowns to eat your burger, or drink your wine from an iv? Don't get me started on the peniscoladas. Fun meal, very entertaining, sign up for the paddling (they really do spank you)."}
{"text":"Had to stop by and see what this was all about. Shared the burger since I heard they were big and since it's all cooked in lard. It wasn't as bad as I thought. The food wasn't greasy and I enjoyed the themed hospital attire. We as customers had to wear a hospital gown and the waitresses had on nurse outfits. Try it out! Oh yeah and you can only share the single bypass no other ones."}
{"text":"2nd time we have been here. 1st time was August of 2015 for the hubbys bday. It was awesome and food was really good. The chocolate shake was to die for!!! But this time food was okay and I dont know what they did to the shakes. The chocolate shake was nasty!! It was dark dark brown and had WAY too much chocolate in it. Like they poured the whole bottle of chocolate syrup in it. And it wasnt thick at all very runny. And I really was looking forward to that shake all week too.Disappointed this time around.service was great both times though no complaints there."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Vegas, and decided to eat at the Heart Attack Grill, which I regretted.  First off, it's cash only, secondly, the quality / flavor of the food is the worst I've had.  How hard is it to screw this up? Seriously? It's a burger / hot dogs and fries place... how can it be bad? How do you mess that up? This place expects to stay in business based entirely on notoriety, I.E. the shock value of eating here.  The hamburger had no taste whatsoever, I suspect it was grade B beef. The bacon looked and tasted like it was cooked days ago, then put under a heat lamp.  I will give them one point - the chili had some flavor,  but the fries like many here have stated were not good. I ate a very large hot dog, and half an order of fries at 1:00pm, and then was throwing up at 6:00 that evening, and couldn't eat again until 11:00pm. It ruined my whole Saturday.  My girlfriend didn't feel well after eating here either."}
{"text":"I really love this place. The atmosphere is so fun and the food is pretty good too! Upon arrival customers are dressed in hospital gowns and waitresses are dressed as nurses. All liquor is given in a large pill bottle, and wine is given in IV bags on a pole. Unhealthy food is king here- seriously there's only burgers, fries, hotdogs and beverages on the menu and no diet drinks! If you don't finish your food your nurse will then give you three good hard spankings lol! I would say this is definitely worth the trip to downtown. If you're looking for a good laugh and are willing to cheat on your healthy diet, come here!"}
{"text":"This place definitely needs to improve on the taste of the food.  We came in expecting a \"wow\" factor... Food deep fried in lard, highest calories, etc.  I don't know about you, but I thought \"high calorie food\" was supposed to taste amazing?  I figured since they advertise how high the calories are- that this was going to be the best burger and chili cheese fries I've ever had.  NOT THE CASE!  I came with a big group of people and we all ordered different things, to give the menu a try.  When I got my food, the burger and chili cheese fries were dripping in grease.  The fries had a grease pool formed around them and the chili looked like ground up dog food.  The worst part- the burger and the fries tasted bland!  You would think with that much grease that it would have SOME flavor.  Everyone in our party threw away most of their food.   I will never eat here again.  The only reason why I didn't give this place 1 star is because it does have some \"one of a kind\" type of experiences.  The staff give you a hospital gown to wear while you eat and the waitresses are all dressed in nurse uniforms and spank you :). I give it to the owner- congrats on contributing to the nationwide obesity epidemic... If your restaurant's food is the last meal someone is going to consume before having a heart attack- at least make it worth while."}
{"text":"This place is everything it's promised to be.  Greasy giant burgers.  How can some of these people give it 1 star because of it's grease?   It's the Heart Attack Grill!  If you don't like grease, stay away from it!  This was an amazing burgers and I really liked the fries.  Amazing cheese / meat ratio on a triple burger.  I finished it all but I didn't feel good afterwards.  ALSO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T OVERCHARGE YOU!  Waitress tried to charge me $10 more than what the total should be.  They count the total up in their head."}
{"text":"Burger crew meeting called to order on Friday, May 20, 2016 at 9:35pm (Burger Crew does Vegas/Burger Crew Founders' Birthday Bash).   Members in attendance: Angela d., Sumana S., Trevor Y., Wayne T. , and Dennis K.  I. Ordering Between the 5 of us, we ordered 3 Single Bypass Burgers (comes with tomato, red onion, cheese, and chili) - $9.25. We opted to add 5 slices of bacon for 92 cents. We were not asked how we wanted to burgers cooked. We each got a coke - $2.08. We also had an order of flatliner fries (cooked in lard) for $1.85.   II. The burgers The best term used to describe these burgers was a \"salt bomb\". The \"doctor\" who brought our order said these burgers were over 3,000 calories each! The burgers were very sizable. They were cooked well done, but surprisingly didn't have a good sear. The bacon was the star of the show. It was crispy and flavorful. It added a great texture and flavor to the burger. The chili was also a great addition to the burger. It helped to mask the lack of meat flavor in the meat patty itself. The red onion was overpowering. They give an entire slice of onion without breaking it up. We were definitely oozing onion breath all over the place for the next couple hours.  III. The fries The fries were cooked in lard, and it makes a difference. Trevor mentioned that he can taste the meatiness in the fries. They were nice and thin, crispy, and \"salty AF\" (according to DK).  IV. Miscellaneous This place is definitely playing up the fact that this stuff is loaded with calories, fat, and salt. It's pretty much the epitome of America. Before going in, you are gowned in a hospital gown. The waitresses are dressed as sexy nurses. Our \"nurse\" Jaimee was great. They have a policy that people are not allowed to split food (except for the single bypass burger and their hot dog). You cannot split anything larger than that. They also do not serve tap water (a bottle of water will cost of $2.08). They are cash only so be sure to bring enough (though they have an ATM inside the restaurant just in case). They also have a policy that if you do not finish your food, the nurse will spank you. They have a little area in the middle of the restaurant they take you and have you bend over and they spank you with a paddle. These nurses are serious! They were serving up some pretty horrifically strong sounding spanks. It was pretty entertaining to watch these guys try to keep a straight face while getting spanked by a sexy nurse. It was even more entertaining to see these grown men beg her to stop! The whole vibe of the restaurant is really fun. It was a great way to kick off our gluttonous weekend of burgerdom.   V. Value The bacon is a great value! You get 5 whole slices for less than a dollar! Most other places charge at least $2 for bacon and you get 2 slices. The value for the burgers increases with the number of patties you add. At $9.25 for a single bypass, it was an alright value since the burger was pretty big, but if you go up to the octuple bypass (yes, that's 8 patties) the value is incredible at only $23.   VI. The verdict This place was fun and the burgers were not as bad as we were expecting them to be. Here are the ratings: 1.9, 2.0, 2.5, 2.8, and 3.0. Fun to go for the atmosphere, but there are definitely better burgers out there.  Next burger crew meeting: Carson Kitchen right after we finish at Heart Attack! Vegas, baby! Wooooooo!"}
{"text":"This place is just not good. The food was subpar and their \"famous\" shakes are just thick soft serve ice cream With a square of butter with it. This place prides itself in being unhealthy which I'm on board with but it doesn't even taste good. There were flies everywhere and food splattered on the 20' ceiling. (?)  Just go to hooters if you want waitresses to look at."}
{"text":"By all means, this is not the place to go to if you're looking for a gourmet meal in Vegas.   Look at the name of the place and you'll find your answer that this is an UNHEALTHY place to eat.  It's part of the gimmick and as this is in Vegas, it's a good tourist attraction that is made to go against the politically correct attitude regarding obesity in today's society.  They advertise on their windows some of the most politically incorrect deals:  Morbidly obese people over 350 pounds eat for free.  And yes, they have cigarettes on their menu, but only unfiltered.    As soon as you walk in, scantily-clad waitresses in nurse uniform greet you and put a hospital apron around you.  You'll see a scale in the middle of the room and can get the nurses to weigh you, if you're near the 350 lb threshold. You're met with music from the 70's and get to take a look at their pro-obesity menu.  Again, these meals are not meant for its taste, but I take it that they try to make everything as fattening and unhealthy as possible to fit the style.  The menu is simple and the burgers come in four different sizes: A single, double, triple, and quadruple with each patty being 1/2 a lb!  I got a single 1/2 lb hamburger (they do not allow you to share any of the bigger burgers) and this was definitely the tastiest thing on the menu. I also got a ButterFat(this is the actual name) shake, fries, and a coke. The burger comes with a thick slice of cheese, tomatoes,  grilled onions, and about 5 strips of bacon.  No vegetables here at all!    Wasn't a big fan of the fries though.  Probably because they proudly proclaimed that they were doused in animal lard before being fried.  It was just too soggy and was as if i were chewing on a soft block of cooking oil.    The shake wasn't all too good either.  They use only cream and garnish is with a slice of butter on top.  I understood why it was called ButterFat though.  Because it was like eating a mashed up stick of butter.  I couldn't eat it, neither could anyone else that I came with  I did like their old school styled Coke though, where they use a glass bottle with actual sugar instead of corn syrup.  Really sugary, but delicious.  I did notice that it was just imported from Mexico however.  No harm in that though.  So my suggestion is if you come here, don't put your hopes on having a good meal.  Come with some friends, take some pictures, and get ready to play along.  And the experience is what earns this place three stars.  Good setting and overall mediocre food (but delicious burgers)."}
{"text":"Pretty nice burger, though a bit pricy.  I enjoyed the double-bypass burger and didn't have to eat for the rest of the day:)"}
{"text":"Heart Attack Grill is based on an extremely unique concept, which makes it a very interesting restaurant.  When I first walked in a nurse helped check me & my friend Mike in. She put hospital gowns on us along with the hospital bracelets, which stated something about a bypass The menu is simple and the burgers come in four different sizes: A single, double, triple, and quadruple with each patty being 1/2 a lb !  We got a single bypass  1/2 lb hamburger (they do not allow you to share any of the bigger burgers) and this was definitely the tastiest thing on. The burger comes with a thick slice of cheese, tomatoes,  grilled onions, and about 5 strips of bacon.     I thoroughly enjoyed the friendly  waitresses are dressed like nurses, down to the good food and the spanking with the PADDLE  if you didn't finish all of your food from your sexy nurse, This is clearly a theme restaurant and the food was great, not excellent. Only because I am not used to fries cooked in LARD. The food is full of fat, but you know that going it.   Highly recommend if your in Vegas with a group of friends or family be sure and stop at this place."}
{"text":"Authors note: Don't come here & then bitch about the obesity crises. You know what you're getting yourself into, this is a business, people like burgers. Come in with a burger craving & a light heart...for it shall be soon filled with the lard you agreed to consume. :)  Themed restaurants are always thee shit. Promotes poor health with HUMOR-the theme is super clever. 350 pounders eat free, everything is double the size, 'refillable'  fries, young ladies as nurses that drape you in hospital gowns asking 'are you a new patient?' These gals are super sweet but being exploited...just peep the waist level mirrors & their short costumes...you'll know what i mean...i liked the T.V.'S central to the eating area...they played old- school videos, cameo's of the place featured on food network....made to make you feel even more lazy- again with the cohesiveness! My cousin who also had to take a trip to the restroom also mentioned the decor: pictures of the waitresses above the urinals pointing down with quote bubbles joking about sizes. Genius. Also with no registers, all change is made with the 'nurses' little boxes...which reminds me of the strip club by the way....including the pictures people insisted on taking...poor girls.   Heart attack foods: A single bypass w/ a coke. The all you can eat fries aren't nothing to write about-BURNT lard masking the taste of the potato itself. i would've liked my lardy potato's a golden brown thank you very much! I only had one serving which is sad considering how I'm a fan of FRIES. The beef patty itself was mediocre at best...They can definitely step their game up for theme pricing they charge-they're very lucky to be blasted on the Food Network. The food network  for foodies is just like being blasted on Oprah, suddenly business is booming.  Though i would've loved to give this place more stars for the food, 3 Stars for the theme."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come here for a long time but we hadn't made it down to Fremont street on the last 2 Vegas trips!  Overall the experience was great.  It was slightly annoying we couldn't be sat without our whole group because it was not very busy...but the gowns were fun, the food was decent, and THE WINE IV.  The wine IV was the whole reason I wanted to go and it was so worth it.  It is huge and only $16...I have never had more fun at a restaurant.  Fries were good, burgers good, I got the hot dog with chili or something on it and it was really good! All decent prices.  Our only turn off was that there was a group of nasty dude at a tabe adjacent to ours and it was uncomfortable to watch them with the waitress.  There were also wierd music videos playing that had been replaced with the waitresses and the (very creepy) owner of the restaurant.  It ended up being more of a sad visit because we just felt bad that our waitress (who was so awesome and friendly!!) had to put up with that.  You can still have the fun, uniqueness of this restaurant while holding some higher respect for your employees - hopefully there is a change!  The rest of my group really did not enjoy it because of everything that was going on, but we all did love the wine IV."}
{"text":"Haha It was a funny experience at this restaurant. My friend ordered the 4 patties burger! I ordered the 2 patties burger and my other friend ordered the 3 patties burger. Customer service is not top notch but it was ok.  I will come back to this place whenever I'm in Vegas to enjoy a funny experience again. lol"}
{"text":"I was so hyped when I heard this spot was coming to Vegas a few years ago. It was slowly anticipating and unveiling. The signs of the burgers and the posters posted around. I came here the day it opened back in October 2011!!!! I personally love this place. It's just all American fast tasty junk food. Burgers and fries. Delicious unhealthy ones at that. The burgers are always satisfying and filling. The fries are cooked to lard perfection and the shakes are so delish. I love the atmosphere and theme of the restaurant. You get admitted and have to wear a hospital gown. If you don't finish (burger at least) the seductive friendly nurses spanky you. Dr. Jon is a true genius and visionary. This restaurant has the potential to last years in Fabulous Las Vegas. Especially being at the center of Neonopolis on Fremont. The location is perfect. The play on art and movie posters throughout the restaurant is a site to see itself. I've never had a disappointing experience here. The staff is always very friendly and enthusiastic about their jobs. I usually gotta come alone cause my friends aren't fond of this spot. I really love it and will continue to visit when I'm here living in LV"}
{"text":"Aside from the fact that this place is everything that is wrong with life.. my honest opinion was that the food is significantly underwhelming... other Yelpers who called this place a tourist trap couldn't be any more on the money. I unfortunately was among the trapped and came here with a group of friends... I have literally nothing good to say about the food at all which is comparable to a large, messy chili-burger ordered from a snack bar at a Little League baseball game. The service was equally bland in all areas and the food took ages to arrive. The best part of my experience was realizing that I wouldn't ever have to come back to this gluttonous hive again."}
{"text":"I went here with my girlfriend. I thought the burger was ok. The service was bad. I took another friend there a couple weeks ago. The burger was awful!! The service was better but the food was worse. I also noticed they had mayonnaise on the table in a squeeze bottle. It was warm! I have had enough of this restaurant. I noticed the last time I was there it wasn't as busy. Maybe others feel the same way."}
{"text":"I've been here twice - with non-local friends of course who insisted to eat here. I got good health insurance and a gym membership, I'm covered. Right outside the restaurant is an old-school ambulance and a sign on top that says \"350LBS EATS FREE\". A glutton's open invite to a free, well, heart attack. People have had heart attacks while eating here - surprise! CASH only!!!  Servers are dressed up as slutty nurses and the guys that work there are dressed up as doctors. Diners put on a hospital gown. If you look like you weigh about 350lbs, they'll weigh you so you can eat for free and get heavier.  Burgers: single bypass, double bypass, triple bypass or quadruple bypass (one patty, 2, 3, 4 patties) cooked in lard and you have an option to add bacon. Fries are of course, cooked in lard.  Drinks: soda, milkshake with butter and alcohol.  Both times I've been here, I've gotten a single bypass with bacon, fries and a water. I don't care if it's toilet water, there's no way I'm drinking butter! The patty is cooked well-done (boo!), the bread is nice and soft, and the bacon is crispy. The fries are made with real potatoes...woohoo! It's alright...  Would I take anyone I love and care about here? Heck no! I'd rather bring them to one of those trendy yuppie chow places! :))"}
{"text":"It's an interesting gimmicky concept for a restaurant. Hospital based setting, staff in nurses outfits. They make you wear a hospital gown as soon as you walk in.   Cash only. They have an ATM if you don't have any cash on you.   You can get spanked by one of the waitresses if you don't finish your food. If you weigh over 350 pounds be sure to get weighed, you eat for free!   Staff are nice and energetic. Food is terrible. It's borderline edible. Keep in mind you are coming here for the experience not the food."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed! I don't like to go to the hospital so why would I want to wear hospital gowns? Why do I want to watch a bunch of fat people getting spanked by carnival folk? Vegas is the correct location for this garbage. If the food was actually good, this would be a far different review. Dumb gimmick!"}
{"text":"Do not be fooled by the food network propaganda of this place. It has the potential to be a really cool place, but unfortunately it is a tacky venue with a dead atmosphere and awful food.  I visited this place because I had read about it online where it was advertised as an upbeat novelty restaurant where you can customize your hamburgers to be as unhealthy as possible. Cool so far, right? WRONG! Here is a short list of grievances:  * No credit cards accepted. SERIOUSLY? We are in Vegas and live in the age of Square and Intuit card readers that cost nothing to set up. Judging by the ATM at the door that charges $5 to withdraw money, I say the owner is trying to make up lost revenue from a poorly run restaurant.   *This is supposed to be a novelty restaurant: fun, upbeat and borderline riské with naughty nurses running around. Well, you get none of that.  The waitresses looked like they are miserable and just go through the motions. They are supposed to 'admit' you into their clinic with some fanfare, but instead all they do is put some shady patient gown on you that smell like cigarettes. Nothing like what is advertised  Food: Nothing to write home about. Sure, you get a lot of blah on your burger, but none of it tastes any good. In fact, some fast food burgers taste better. For a burger packed with fatty cheese and bacon it is sure missing the taste and flavor needed to make it memorable.  Overall a disappointing experience. The owner of is placed probably invested millions in all the decor and paraphernalia in the restaurant... He should try to invest some money in training and getting a better staff."}
{"text":"This place isn't as bad as a lot of people make it seem. I didn't eat much, just a single bypass but my boyfriend and my brother had that and flat liner fries as well. To be honest the fries didn't look all that desirable but they kept going back for seconds.  My burger was nummy however! They didn't seem to drench it in lard too much, it was certainly a 3 napkin burger though. The meat itself was tasty and the cheese was so good. To be honest it was probably the best burger I had that was under $10.  The girls themselves were pretty cute and weren't dressed that skanky. They seemed to of changed the outfits since the time they aired on various shows, except for the ample cleavage and the slits on  the back that got you peeks of red undies. You go in thinking your gonna be proper and not take a look ... but it kind of happens anyway. I'm a girl and I am not complaining. They look a lot more natural and girls next doorish then the hard boobed plastic Hooters gals.  They only got 4 stars from me because the service was almost nonexistent. Maybe because there was a girl in the group? I feel sorry for the boys that the girls didn't spend any time to flirt with them like they did with most dudes there. I would of like to of been asked if I wanted something else to drink. But oh well. They also seem to close a bit early for a Friday night.  Don't know if I would go again, maybe if I am feeling spontaneous ... Mostly because I am moving next month. But if I ever come back to visit I would probably look them up.  P.S. Bring cash. I didn't know they didn't accept cards until I got there. There was an ATM but I used the bank in the same shopping center."}
{"text":"I was somewhat excited to try this place. Then I saw the menu as I was walking in. It looked revolting. I don't want to know that the fries are done in 100% lard and that the milkshakes are made with pure butter fat. The beer selection was less than mediocre. The ambiance wasn't great.   Then I told them I didn't want to wear the nasty smock-thing they want to put on you, and they told me I had to. So I walked out. I'm guessing I saved myself several days worth of calories for not much taste. I ended up at Chicago Brewing Company at 4 Queens, which, while it's not as good as the original in Summerlin, still kicks the shit out of the Heart Attack place.  And really? You eat for free if you're over 350 pounds? That should be illegal."}
{"text":"Me and my wife took my mother in law here when she came down from Sacramento. I have to admit the whole hospital gown and wrist band was cheesy . But the food was great .Me and my wife got the double bypass burger and my mother in law got the single . The burgers was AWESOME with 6 slices of bacon on each patty right there it made it one of mt favorite burgers. But the thick greasy patties and the cheese just dripping down made this worth putting on the gown.The fries are almost as good as the burgers.My wife was not happy because they did not have diet soda but other then that all 3 of us enjoyed the experience.Oh yea by the way Heather the nurse was so damn hot .Her bending over and seeing her cleavage  alone  gave me a fever. lol We will be going back every time my mother in law comes to visit."}
{"text":"Must go for the experience. As for the food. Wife had a burger I took a bite of it and Must say one of the worst burgers I have ever had. Onion rings are worth ordering and plenty to fill you up. Staff is amazing takes great care of you and hands out a serious ass woopin if you don't eat all the burger. Order wisely!!"}
{"text":"I have never been to restaurant that is so much about the experience. It was fantastic!! First all the waitress dress in sexy nurse outfits. If you weight more than 350lbs you eat for free. You have to wear a Johnny while you are there. At least 4 people have had a heart attack while eating here.   The food is gigantic proportions. It is good food but nothing mind blowing. The burgers come as single double or triple bypass. Even the hot dogs are a full foot long.  If you don't finish all of your food you get brought to the center of the room for a firm paddling by one of the nurses.   All alcohol is served in a medicine container with funny directions such as \"may cause you think you're Mike Tyson and get your ass kicked\" or \"may cause arm loss after a coyote ugly night. They also have specialty drinks and shots such as the peniscillin shot which is a creamy liquor served in a penis shaped syringe."}
{"text":"What a shit show... it'll be gone soon enough. Stay away.  Overpriced garbage I wouldn't serve in county jail. Yeah, big boob girls.. so what, you're in Vegas and they are everywhere and at better places.   Just a gimmick to separate you from your money!"}
{"text":"Went here with my father, sisters & my 3 girls. Although the food was great I don't really recommend bringing children here. I thought the whole experience was hilarious & fun but my teenage sisters were very uncomfortable with the outfits the waitresses wear. My daughters (7, 4 & 2) were on edge already just by seeing the wall decor but they became very upset when they watched a grown man being SPANKED with a paddle. They didn't understand what was going on & they thought they were next  like i said already - this place is great, just leave the kids with a sitter  also they only take CASH so prepare for that!"}
{"text":"Once you walk in the door your directed to a room where there's a video explanation of what's about to happen playing, & your changed into a hospital gown. They tried to tell me to leave my daughters stroller in that room, which wasn't in plain sight for me to keep an eye on so I asked if I could keep her in the stroller at the table.   Then once we were sat the server took forever to greet our table. Then it took forever to get her to come back to the table to take our order, & then again to get our check. I feel like they should have more servers on staff because of all the stuff they do on top of serving here. I mean our server spend more time spanking people with a paddle then she did at our table.  The food wasn't all that good, I ordered the smallest burger with regular fries. My husband ordered the smallest burger with chili & chili cheese fries & our whole table had a stomach ache that night & the next day.   It was something to experience while in Vegas but I definitely won't be coming back again."}
{"text":"love the food and the services ,but you neesd to weight at 350ib to eat the burgers for free, the burgers are big and jucey"}
{"text":"Delicious food and a fun, well-themed experience. The service is great too!   The burger is best with the chili."}
{"text":"The food was decent, but the atmosphere and servers really make this place special.  I got my three spankings, and they didn't hold back. The Jell-O shot shots were very tasty, and the girl servers were a sight to see. I would definitely go to this place again."}
{"text":"ATM Machine rip off ! Be Warned!!!  Large sign on front door says ATM charges 75 cents. When you swipe your card at the machine it says the fee is $1.95.  What kind of blatant scam is that? Plus its not an Allpoint machine so your bank also charges a fee. Complete bait and switch scam."}
{"text":"Yeah, it's just ok. The place is a lot of fun and the food is decent, but the looming threat of being paddled over not finishing definitely puts a damper on the mood (unless you are into that sort of thing). The service was slow, but the servers were nice. Basically, it is a spectacle. You go there for the spectacle. You go elsewhere for food."}
{"text":"We went there last night, even after reading reviews!!! I said sometimes people are just nasty and can't find fun in anything! It was fun but more so.... Those are the best fries ever & the burger is really good, they put them through a roll cooker (pretty much well done)so you can't order meat the way you want it, otherwise I'd have a rare one and they'd get five stars!!! The shake is over the top RICH but certainly worth it, we shared, way too rich for one person!!! It's fun, its Vegas and well worth trip... Also fun to see people get on that huge scale and see if they eat free!!! 3 guys did while we were there and whole restaurant clapped! If you're over 350lbs dinner is on them! btw we were there with 5 people no one ate free and everyone agreed!!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and staff were very plesant and easy to talk to.   Ordered the double and it was more that I could handle.   The fries were awesome.  Made the mistake of ordering a diet coke...  They don't sell anything that's not full of calories.  They even put a pat of butter on top of the milkshake.    Wish this place was franchised so that we could have one here."}
{"text":"The scale outside is fun for people watching as are the spankings administered for not eating your dinner. The shakes are good. The fries are not great. The burgers are average. Our service was only fair. I personally won't make that stop again and don't really recommend it at all."}
{"text":"The metaphore for American glutony reigns here at the Heart Attack Grill. Yes, I can attest that people over 350 pounds eat for free as there were several in the establishment. The burger, I had a single patty burger, was very good. But the fries were cold and horrible. They did not par-boil the potatoes so although they were fried in lard, they were very mushy and came cold to all of us at the table. None of us ate them as we all made the icky face. The sugar Cokes were good, better flavor than the typical US high-fructose corn syrup. Know this novel establishment is just that, novel."}
{"text":"My friend had heard about this place and was dying to go .. so off we went.   I'd give it 2 stars for the food but 3 stars for the kitsch factor and the decadent butterfat shakes.   I have to admit it's kinda fun (and funny!) to walk in and have them put a hospital gown and bracelet on ya. They also spank you if you don't finish your food -- which was pretty comical when it happened to my friend. Service was friendly and quick too which was nice.   However, I have to agree with a lot of other posters that the food itself is pretty lacking here. The burger was way overdone and pretty tasteless unless you drowned it in condiments. The fries were actually crispy and well done but nothing I'd run back for anytime soon. The best thing on the menu was the chocolate shake which was super rich and creamy.   If you go, I'd skip the burgers, get a shake and some fries and just enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"I could not be more appalled by any place in my life my girlfriend has a service dog and they denied her at the door and then the owner use profanity against her I could not wait to write this review this is absolutely the worst place ever been into and I will never ever tell anyone to go him I'm glad it has such horrible ratings already"}
{"text":"This place should just stick to entertainment..first off was the smell..it literally smelled  like something had died..then came the most fat content burger (I'm not even sure it was beef) that tasted like it was grilled with lard. It was so greasy it needs to be served with a toothbrush. I could not eat my burger but thank God I could pass on the public flogging. They don't just spank you..they smack you with a wooden paddle as hard as they want..it was rather hard to watch. They would have better business if they made changes to the menu and maybe sold food."}
{"text":"While in Vegas we ran upon Heart Attack Grill. The set up, theme and environment is fun. The food is awful, but it's all about the experience. When you walk in you are greeted by a nurse, providing you with hospital gowns. We were seated, and advised it's cash only(there's an ATM inside the restaurant) The menu consists of burgers, hotdogs, fries, onion rings, soda, wine and cocktails. Wine comes in an iv bag and liquor in a prescription medicine bottle. The burgers come in multiple sizes and if you don't finish you can end with a spanking from the nurse or doctor. Even though l didn't enjoy the food I would return for the drinks and fun."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place on the news, so I knew this was going to be a cool experience and it was. They first put a hospital gown on you to simulate you being in a hospital. Then we looked at the menu and saw Burgers and Hot Dogs or should I say Cows and Dauchsunds. These meals were so huge it was incredible to think that anyone could eat this stuff. Everything had chili on it and there was not a salad or Diet drink anywhere in the house. They truly live up to it's name. I don't know what is more odd, the fact that they feed customers who are over 350 lbs. for free or that they literally spank their customers after they have eaten. Luckily was not either of the two, but I did manage to eat 90% of my \"Double Bypass Burger\" which was humongous. Those in my party could not even put a dent in their literal \"Footlong\" hotdog smothered in chili so I took that home and had my way with it. It's taken me about a week to run off all those carbs from that meal alone. Some of the hilarious points of this place was the waitresses being dressed as nurses, the owner was dressed like a doctor and the men's urinals in the restroom had photos of George W. Bush and Barack Obama....I chose Obama. Ha ha ha!!"}
{"text":"Took my family here today, this place is crazy fun!! If you haven't been here yet, you need to go,  at least once in your lifetime."}
{"text":"Finally went and checked this place out.  Loved the neon signs and the location of the burger joint.  The ambulance outside and the cute movie posters were very appealing .  The owner/Doctor greeted us but didn't have much of a personality not like what I have expected from all the articles.  Our nurse didn't have much of a personality comparred to the others we saw that were more engaged with their patients.  Ours may have been new and just a little shy.  We sat not far from the scale and saw a couple of skinny people get on it for a laugh.  They have DJ.  I don't know why everyone is saying they don't serve bottle water - I got it. My only complaint was that they didn't have fountain drinks with ice.  I really wanted a Dr. Pepper or Mr. Pibb but the machine was broken.  I did get a coke in a glass bottle and got a straw.  I got the single bypass and my husband got the double.  The burgers were served within 5 minutes of waiting.  They were EXCELLENT.  The cheese had a very good flavor and the fries were very crispy.  We did witness two people get the 8000 calorie burger; 1 was a very large man and the other 1 was a little guy who ordered it for a good laugh.  They also had a really nice bar area too.  It seemed a little dead in there but we did eat around 5PM.  I think they need to add credit card machines and fountain drinks and that is why I am giving three stars.  I have to say it was an excellent burger and I loved the cuteness of the creativity of the Doctor.  I wish the Doctor nothing but success.  We don't want another practice in Vegas to close down."}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if I could. The worst burger joint EVER. Service was horrible, waitress was super rude. STUPID RULES. You CANNOT SHARE YOUR FOOD or take it home. and if you dont finish all of it you get spanked with a paddle. (Pretty hard I might add) and u would not finish your food because it is downright NASTY. Ive had better burgers from burger king. Single bypass was dry tasted like crap. Super low quality food. Chili seriously reminded me of dog food. Everyone In my group was severely dissapointed and I would never suggest anyone waste their money here. Goto in n out. way cheaper. Way better."}
{"text":"Love the food. Love the atmosphere. The best french fries! The juicy hamburger is delicious! Great food! And fun place!"}
{"text":"Wow just ate a quad burger!!! And finished it!!!! Burger was great but the ambiance was even better!!!! Had a blast laughing and kidding around with the nurses, my nurse was a cute girl with short dark hair very friendly and helpful, like I said finished my burger, but wife encouraged her to spank me, no complaint from me she gave me 3 wacks to which I replayed\"Is that it??\" So she had nurse rikki come over and give me 3 more!! It's all in fun, if your in Vegas you owe it to yourself to go Fremont St and enjoy The Heart Attack Grill!! You won't regret it!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, After seeing this on the food network I figured it would have a high level of quality, and possibly great customer service. Boy, was I wrong,, THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE, I cant say anything good about this place. I guess I could come up with the environment was pretty cool but, wow, the food was horrible. Honestly the worst burger my girlfriend and I EVER had. Burger and Fries two waters, OVER 20 bucks. Cold Fries, Horrible service, overall a horrible experience. I would not recommend this to anyone. STAY AWAY!!"}
{"text":"This place is a blast. It's a theme that is so wrong, fatty, greasy food and booze. No diet or lite anything. The burgers and dogs are HUGE. Add chili to everything and its even better. Add bacon and it's the bomb.  You are given a hospital arm band and an examination gown at the front door. Our waitress was a little person, blonde, and dressed as a nurse. She loves her job. Playing the part and having fun. If you dont fininsh your meal, she will paddle you with a wooden paddle while you bend over a custom rack. LOL.    Go for the fun. Enjoy the good food too."}
{"text":"This place is great! So much fun. Wine in an IV bag, shots in a pill bottle. If you don't eat your meal you get spanked. If you want a salad stay home. If you want a huge burger that tastes amazing come in and have a blast. Don't listen to all the haters."}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give this place 1 star but I'm forced to. I have a service dog and though my own fault failed to bring her vest when I loaded my car and left Los Angeles. I have never been given a hard time with her until now. The looks alone that I got from the greeter were enough for me. She was asking questions that were against the ADA regulations. Does anyone train their employees anymore? I was so offended that I had to go back to my car to get the documentation. By the time I walked back to the parking lot with my dog, she just wanted to sit in the car. I called my family to order for me only to find out that they do not accept take out orders.  I do understand rules and so my best to follow them. I heard of this place and made it a point to go. But they have too many rules. Again, it was my fault that I left her vest but I have not visited a place yet (my hotel & other restaurants) that have given me such a hard time.  I don't eat this type of cuisine and was only going to order just for the photo op but they lost a customer and anyone else I can reach out to. I realize my experience won't matter too much and other people will continue to visit but I noticed not too many people are too happy which is why they only got 3 stars."}
{"text":"Hooters comes to mind when you think of a place like this. Yes. Hooters with hamburgers. Now that I think about it. Hooters and good food have nothing in common. Where as the Heart Attack Grill has pretty good burgers.   But you know you're walking into a situation where the servers are going to be running with the theme of a hospital and be dressed as nurses. Let me quote Animaniacs and say  \"Helloooooooooo Nurse!\"   From the get go they tell you that eating here is not good for your health. It says it on the front of the door. It's like a cactus with spikes pointed out just telling you \"This will hurt if you touch it!\" But hell, who doesn't want a hamburger named after a medical procedure  You walk in and the place is set up like a huge bar made out of a giant red cross logo in the middle. Inside of which the dressed in nurse gear servers take your order while sports play on television. This place is delightfully tacky.   burgers vary and a bypass is considered a half pound patty. So there's a single bypass, double bypass, triple bypass and quadruple bypass. You get the deal. They have fries that are cooked with lard. Sounds healthy, right?  It wasn't till about half way into the meal that I realized that the inner red cross symbol of a counter had mirrors that were angled up. This caught me off guard, like - wait, why am I looking up skirts while enjoying a burger? But sure enough they're there on purpose to give you a better view of the underwear of the waitresses. Oh man, that's when the misogyny was in full bloom, right?   Before feeling like a tool of the Patriarchy I looked over at the margarita bar and there was two couples that had to be in their 70's or early 80's. All of them eating the single bypass. And I really just thought to myself that this place couldn't be so bad if they are able to attract those elderly people here.   Either that or I need to rethink what I know about the elderly. This may be a case of Benny Hill syndrome and I'm just not hearing the Yakity Sax playing in the background.  During the course of the meal they also had someone weigh in at the proper 350 pounds and surly enough, he got his food for free and the people in the place were screaming and egging him on.   I would like to think that while they encourage you to let it all go. In fact making it so that if you suffer from Systemic and Diabetic II levels, you get your meal for free, that there's some sort of life lesson to be learned here.  Maybe coming here and getting put center stage causes you to re-evaluate your weight problems. after your gluttonous burger and up-skirt adventure you'll change your ways..   So how was the food? The burger was really juicy for being a massive pound and a half of meat between the burns.   It has a salad bar of condiments. So they pretty much give you the burger with bread and meat. You put the tomatoes and lettuce on it. I imagine they wouldn't want to encourage eating veggies. It would ruin their street cred.   They have real bottled sodas here, so that's a plus. Over all, if you can get past the whole idea that they're encouraging obesity (Well, not really - just being honest about their food) and move past the fact that you have short skirt wearing servers, then it's a stop worthy venture to come out to the Heart Attack Grill."}
{"text":"It's a novel  idea BUT - burgers are not good. Tastes a bit like canned meat. I adore burgers (as you'll see if you look at my other reviews ). You pay for water (bottled) and I complained that my burger was cold - server apologised then didn't take it off the bill. Guess she wasn't bothered.  I wouldn't return to this place. Save yourself $6 and go to in n out. A much much better burger."}
{"text":"This place is terrible, i love the concept its a fun place to visit but they couldn't make the food taste good,  after all those calories. The burgers tasted so plan it was not juicy at all, i mean come on i was hoping it tasted much better than that after the advertised fat content seriously wtf, maybe i had a bad order. The the shake was disgusting it had way to much unwanted flavor after a few scoops u get tired of it , i think they could make like 20 regular shakes from that one shake. And the fries it was the most disgusting fires i ever eaten, i thought it would taste good because it was fried with lard but it don't taste good at all and smells bad . Tell me what is the point of eating so much calories if the food don't taste good why do they have to put these unwanted calorie load when the food don't even taste good. Just make the food taste good not the calorie content higher that's all they gotta do. But still i do recommend visiting this place because of the theme of the whole restaurant."}
{"text":"How does this place stay in business. Such cruel service. Blown away at how rude they were. I feel disrespected here and would not come back."}
{"text":"I love this place great burgers and the butterfat milk shakes are out of this world just be sure to finish your burger or you'll get paddled! They only accept cash so no credit cards! The service is outstanding as well."}
{"text":"Okay burger. Too many \"rules\" that are probably funny for drunk single guys but I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Heart Attack Grill is the epitome of oxymoron. Nurses triaging and medicating you with high calorie, heart clogging treats. How fun?! Our drinks were served by prescription from the nurses and every detail of the restaurant was well thought out. Most importantly the place was clean and the menu was very reasonably priced. Can't wait to visit on future trips!"}
{"text":"This is probably more of a 3.5 star review.  I keep going back and forth whether to give this place 3 stars or 4 on the Yelp rating.  After drinking enough booze to kill an elephant at the Lee's event at the Hilton, my husband and I wanted to run crazy around Fremont Street and zipped in a cab here last weekend.  We were really hungry - and saw this place and decided that being drunk might be the only time we would be brave enough to eat here.  I found it surprisingly pretty decent, not the best burger I've ever tasted, as that title goes to Annie's Island Fresh Burgers on Big Island, Hawaii:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/annies-island-fresh-burgers-kealakekua  They use good quality meat  but char the hell of it to like Medium/Well done, something I wish they would change to make a better, juicier burger.  Don't get anything more than a single unless you want to be sick, it is more than enough food.  I'm under the impression that if we were to have gone there earlier, or at least not on a Saturday night, that the burgers would have probably been a little better cooked.  The fries, however, were very well cooked and very flavorful.  Some of the best I have had in town.  I came in knowing about the hospital gowns and was expecting them, and thought they were really cool.  I'm not sure why people would go to a gimmick restaurant and then complain about the gimmick, but c'est la vie.  It's like when a vegetarian goes to a steakhouse and complains there is no food for them.  If you don't like this sort of thing - don't go.  One big complaint I have is that it was so loud in the restaurant that we even had trouble placing our order, much less carrying on any kind of drunken conversation.  There was a band playing there, who was very good, and all were wearing the standard scrubs and nurses outfits.  It was funny.  But while I appreciate and love live music very much, having to shout our orders at the top of our lungs right into the waitress's ear several times does kind of leave a bad first impression.    Overall this is a pretty decent place at the moment.  They have a few kinks that they need to work out with the noise and ensuring that they cook the burgers properly regardless of the time of day.  But you can tell the owner of this location cares enough to buy quality product and because of that I think this place has a lot of potential.  I am sure we will find ourselves back here some day to see if things have improved."}
{"text":"I had the animal-fat fries here they were good and tasty just like I remember from back in the day . Hit it up if your really hungry and like tourist traps ."}
{"text":"Ok burgers, good onion rings, boring fries. Service is highly dependent on your waitress. Shakes are good, but VERY filling.  Yes, there are a lot of people (all were men from what we saw) who wanted \"paddle spankings\" given by the waitress. Supposedly you get spanked if you don't finish your food. But there were. LOT of people who volunteered (even my 12 yo son)!  We had a great waitress, but since of the others seemed a little lackluster. So for us, it was a great/fun meal. But I can see how it might be disappointing"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. THAT is a high-calorie, greasy, sinfully delicious, artery-clogging burger.   Try the penis shots if you dare.   Always a pleasure for both ends! (They really do spank you if you don't finish your burger. And boy do those nurses spank hard!)"}
{"text":"This is a fun experience restaurant.  The servers are hot nurses that spank you if you don't finish your food.  The cooks are doctor's.  Jello shots are served in syringes, and you have to wear a hospital gown when you eat here.  The health scare stuff doesn't bother me because I don't here that often, and this was how a lot of food used to be cooked anyway.  The burgers are pretty good, but I don't like the fries - they are always limp.  However, I've tried the chili cheese fries recently and they are amazing.  I might even just get that next time.  I could swear that the chili has chorizo in it!  Yum.  The one thing that really sucks is that they only accept cash - so lazy.  First time I ate here I was wondering why every employee was playing with their phones, until I realized that it's the system they use to place and track orders."}
{"text":"This place is fun and unique.  Although the food is... well.... not all that healthy, it's a great place to go for an occasional outing.  A must see!"}
{"text":"Ohhh myyy!! Came here Sunday lunch time and New Year's Day, no line; niiiiceee!!!! Reminds me childhood, get spank when you don't finish your food. Ouch!  The only RESTAURANT you get spank when you don't finish your food. Servers wear scrubs and nurses outfit while costumers were gown. Very unique and fun.   FOOD: -1/2lb coronary dog is good and its huge. It has chili cheese, loaded of bacon and onions. I had hard time finishing it, good thing I have friends got my back.  - Chili cheese fries reminds me of Tommys. Eat it while still warm.  - Double bypass burger: burger patty is thick but it's kinda dry. It comes with onion, loaded bacons, tomatoes, lettuce Almost got me heart attack I thought I'm not going to my finish my food, good thing I came with empty stomach and friends who can eat.  Price is about right food is enormous.  Don't forget to bring cash because it's CASH ONLY!!"}
{"text":"You have to go here once.  If you survive, you will not want to go again. HAG is a gimmick.  Sexy nurses, super fat food, milkshakes with butter floating on top.  Super heavy people (350+) eat free if they are willing to publicly weigh in.  But like all gimmicks, if they can't deliver on the product, they won't last.  The burgers are bad.  Flavorless patties of cheap, fatty ground beef.  The fries, limp like the customers at some of the lamer strip clubs in town.  They don't serve water or diet soda so you are stuck with overly sweet milkshakes or regular coke.  whether you go for the single or quadruple bypass, you will leave feeling heavy and disappointed.  We went the opening week but from what I hear from recent goers, it hasn't gotten much better.  Perhaps the only thing keeping it open this long is the constant influx of tourists who have to see it once."}
{"text":"So FUN, and So Super FULL. Lets start off with the fact that its a \"gimmicky\" Place....Hello its Vegas, everything is gimmicky.  When you walk up to the door there is a HUGE scale to see if you are huge enough to get a free meal.  most people like to step on it for fun and see where they rank, but as a chick, NO THANKS I do not need to see what I weigh before I go and stuff my face LOL.  You are given a scrub top (hospital gown) to put on,, I can see why, the food can get a little messy.  Our server was AWESOME!!!! She was this tiny petite ball of fire that made my entire dining experience.  When she first came over to great us she quickly informed me that the portions were a good size and that there is punishment if you don't finish your entire meal....So glad she did too, cause my eyes were once again going to be bigger then my stomach.  I get the Chili Fries and a single burger.  It was so yummy. I really struggled to eat it all because I didn't want the spanking that comes with not finishing my meal. I got to watch several people not finish and those gals enjoyed giving them a spanking....not just a little love tap.... they hit HARD! This is definitely a novelty place, and fun to experience when you are in the area."}
{"text":"So I came here with some friends recently and we thought to ourselves, hey let's check out Heart Attack Grill! This restaurant is located on Fremont St (the Fremont Street Experience). Once you arrive there, you will notice a HUGE scale in front of the entrance. Apparently if you weigh 350 lbs or more - you can eat free!  But anyways, as we walked inside, the hostess (dressed as a nurse) greets you and gives you a patient wristband that says (I survived a bypass @ Heart Attack Grill) as well as a patient gown. PS - you return those gowns after your visit, too bad we don't get to keep them as a souvenir! :D  As for the menu, for drinks they offer shakes, water, Cola, and alcoholic drinks (in syringe shots). My boyfriend wanted to try the Chocolate butter fat shake. The appearance of it is enough to make someone lose their appetite LOL, but it tasted pretty good. If you want water, they pretty much just give you a water bottle so I don't know about refills.  We both ordered the single bypass cheeseburger. Each \"bypass\" is the equivalent of a burger patty. I think the most you can order is a quadruple bypass, in which you get a free wheelchair ride by the waitress nurse. The burger itself was good, but nothing too special. We also had the chili cheese fries, which were also delicious.  BE FOREWARNED (for those who are kinky and/or enjoy crime & punishment) If you do not finish your burger, you are entitled to 3-4 spanks by your nurse waitress. And on top of that, they videotape it for you to watch at home on their main website. Pretty cool, huh? It looks pretty painful. Depending on the nurse waitress you get, some hit harder than others. One of the customers got spanked and the paddle broke, LOL.  But overall, I would have to say that this place is more for the \"experience\" rather than the food, since it tasted like any other burger place (except more fattier).  So would I come here again? It was an interesting experience, but one heart attack is good enough for me. :)"}
{"text":"The burgers may not be the best in las vegas, but the atmosphere was fun. The servers was dressed up as nurses and if you do not finish your meal , you will get spanked. Also there are scales to weigh you and if you weigh more than 350, you eat for free. worth the stop!!"}
{"text":"Loved it so the reviews that seem to be expecting something that it is not shouldnt have even stepped foot into here.  It was fun and tasty."}
{"text":"These burgers with bacon are very tasty.  I only regret that they do not serve diet soda (LOL).   Hubby downed a double."}
{"text":"Tried the Triple Bypass Burger with bacon. It was fresh and tasty. Add salt and pepper as needed. Fries were great and shake was good but too thick for me. Washed it down with a 24oz Miller Highlife.  Must try just for the experience, the kids enjoyed their food as well!"}
{"text":"Food came out cold and burgers were clearly frozen. Manager refused a refund, didn't apologize and clearly didn't care that we had a bad experience. Overrated"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from some of my friends and of course on TV. So when I had the chance to visit AZ, I just had to hit it up, since I LOVE burgers.   As you walk in the door, you are greeted by good looking girls in skimpy nurses outfits. When you are seated, everyone must put on a hospital robe before ordering. There are even mirrors behind the counter that are angled up for a view of the waitress's sexy nurse costumes. So far so good....   My expectations were very high but they did nothing but disappoint with their burger. Their all you can eat fries on the other hand were absolutely amazing (I even went back for 2nds).   They do have a great concept here, but they just have to work on their burger recipe."}
{"text":"This place was great.  The staff was perky and friendly. The food and drinks were good at a great price and ladies the bathroom was super clean. Everyone make this a must visit."}
{"text":"Go for the experience!  The menu is hysterical, esp. the vegan section.  The decor is kitschy diner with mock movie posters and larger than life onion rings, stethoscope, cigarette, etc.  The food was ok.  I finished my lunch out of fear of getting spanked.  CASH ONLY.  Fyi - they don't serve iced tea because it's not fatty enough and they serve water only because the Health Department requires them to."}
{"text":"Honestly come here for the experience. It's a super fun place and good to take fun pictures and tell your friends. Prices are ok as well. The food was OK at best though. Almost gross actually. Once you see all the grease it kind of gets to you. They would benefit quite a bit from making a good burger and other items. But instead they choose to just cook everything in pure butter or lard. I love burgers like no other. Atmosphere in this place is cool. Food wise it's quite disappointing, I am happy I went though. Oh just for records sake. I had a chili dog with 5 slices of bacon, chili fries, milk shake, and of course a DOUBLE By-pass burger... Yeah I finished it all as well!!! Ha!!!"}
{"text":"If you are of an Asian descent then please don't eat here!  Our bodies are not meant to be treated this way.  The quality of food was horrible and it wasn't cheap either.  It is a Cash Only place so bring some if you can't help yourself to the big fancy Tourist restaurant sign.   That sign got me so after eating here, all my pimples got excited and now they wanted attention.  Walked around Vegas like zombie.  Everyone in my group got food comas and weren't feeling well for a couple hours.  I'll gladly pay to not ever do that again.  If you want gout, oily face, body odor, constipation, random hairs growing on your back, and not being able to cut your own toe nails... then I guess you should eat here and then stay away from the rest of us."}
{"text":"I have been \"dying\" to go to the Heart Attack Grill for years, ever since they opened the now closed location in Chandler, Arizona. When I found out they opened one in Las Vegas I couldn't wait for my next trip to Sin City so I could finally risk my life by eating a burger and fries.  That day finally came!!  At the end of the Fremont Street Experience, I walked in the door and was promptly greeted by one of the sexy naughty nurses. She put a hospital gown on me and asked me where I wanted to sit. Being alone I chose to sit at the bar and be served by the doctor/bartender. All the nurses and doctors were very nice and fun.  I ordered the single bypass, not because I am a wuss by any means, but because I was in Vegas and didn't want to be in a food coma for the rest of the night. I did augment my burger with an order of \"flatliner fries\" which are cooked in pure lard.  Honestly, I was a little concerned about the fries. I thought being cooked in pure lard would just make them greasy, but they were actually quite tasty. They are actual cut potatoes and not processed potato parts like most restaurants. They were definitely my favorite part of the meal.  The burger itself was good but unremarkable. I've definitely had better and I didn't particularly care for the bun. Still it wasn't bad at all.  The doctor/bartender tried to sell me on the butterfat milkshake, but I am not a fan of buttermilk. She made me a taste of it and I didn't like it, but while it was not to my taste I could definitely see others liking it. As I said, I don't like buttermilk. If you do, you would probably like the shakes.  Make no mistake though, the true appeal of this place isn't the food but rather the atmosphere. As mentioned before the staff was all very nice and fun.   If you go make sure someone in your party asks for \"pain management therapy.\" I am not going to tell you what it is, just that you definitely should have someone in your party do it, and it probably shouldn't be you. :)  Would I go back? Probably not by myself and not just for the food, but if I am with others who haven't experienced it I would definitely take them there. And make one of them get the pain management therapy.  FYI, about my rating. I would actually give them a 3 1/2 star, but since yelp doesn't allow that they get the extra 1/2 star."}
{"text":"Cash only  This place would fall under my \"must try once\" list. We ordered a burger, fries, coke and a butter milkshake. The burger we ordered was the smallest burger on the menu which was in my opinion still pretty large. With the restaurant being called \"Heart Attack Grill\" you would think that the burgers itself would be really good.  Unfortunately, it wasn't. I guess you come here for quantity, not quality.   As for the fries, it was alright. The one that surprised me most of all would have to be the butter milkshake.  It was better than what I expected it to be.  They do have an interesting theme. Waitresses are dressed up in nurse uniforms (not scrubs) and patrons are given hospital gowns to wear while eating at the restaurant. We actually took a picture with the owner who was dressed up as a doctor. My coworker recommended I try this place out and he mentioned that he got spanked for not eating all his food. We came when the restaurant just opened so the only people in there were a group of Japanese tourists who seem to be enjoying the place greatly. We didn't see any spanking or any of that sort because we ate all our food and we left before the group of tourists could. They also advertise that people who weigh over 350 lbs eat for free.   Would I recommend this place? Yes, but just to try once. It's called Heart Attack Grill.  I doubt anyone wants to increase their chances of a heart attack."}
{"text":"I had very high expectations for this place because of the media attention and YouTube videos. Unfortunately, this place does not live up to expectations. The lard fried French fries are average at best and the burgers are just  decent not bad but not great. I must however pay tribute to the Milkshakes. The milkshakes are made with butter fat and are absolutely amazing. Best vanilla Milkshake I've ever had.  The servers are all young, attractive women dressed up as sexy nurses. The service left something to be desired though because the main promotion is anyone over 350 lbs eats free. I was weighed by the hostess when I arrived and let's just say, I qualify. After we ate, the nurse brought us the bill and my meal was not comped. I asked about the promotion and she said that I don't eat free because she didn't see me weigh in. After a long debate with the manager, it was determined that I could weigh in again and get my meal comped. I didn't mind the second weigh in much (the whole restaurant applauded me both times, kinda fun) but the waitress was unhappy and made it very clear.  Probably won't return unless I'm in need of a free meal."}
{"text":"Didn't eat here, but did visit.. been wanting to since I saw the funny videos on youtube about it 2 years ago.  It was very intriguing and I laughed at all the crazy signs on the walls, and the scale that basically told me I'm too fat.   As far as the people in the place, they let me take pictures and were really friendly... That kind of speaks volumes in itself that I wasn't even giving them money and they were just overall very nice.  Maybe if I become a super fat guy I'll eat here.. you know.. to end it all.  But until then, I think I'll hang on to my blood pressure where it is for now."}
{"text":"Don't read the bad reviews! Come in with a open mind and you will have an amazing time!! A group of four went. Each couple split the single burger and a order of onion rings, which was plenty of food! I have no idea how people can eat more. I also order a Jack Daniels and Coke. The jack came in a medicine bottle. It was great!! The waitress were super sweet, fun and energetic! I wish I remembered her name... I thought it was such a fun themed restaurant. And yes! They with spank you!!! I didn't get spank but they spanked a few and damn they hit hard!! Hahaha it was so funny!!! But of course you can say no."}
{"text":"The Heart Attack Grill is one of those things that you put on your bucket list, but hope that it doesn't actually cause you to kick the bucket. Apparently, a few people have died after eating here. The taboo nature of this place adds to the mystique and intrigue that surrounds it. The world is full of risk takers and many of them are in Las Vegas.   After entering the establishment, we were quickly given hospital gowns and the hospital-like \"admission\" bracelets. I felt adventurous so I ordered the quadruple by-pass, which consisted of four half-pound hamburger patties, four slices of cheese and the usual condiments. I decided to not have the bacon slices. Others in the party ordered the single and double by- pass burgers. There's also flat-line fries, extremely high-calorie milkshakes, soda, and other high-calorie, not-so-healthy goodies.  I had to divide the burger in two to eat it - I wrestled with the first two patties and everything above them for round one and then the last two patties and everything below them for round two. I also had a third of my best friend's wife's milk shake and some french fries. The battle lasted about a half hour, but I claimed victory by devouring the entire burger.   There's a large metal scale at the restaurant, which is reminiscent of a livestock scale, that people sometimes use to weigh themselves. I weighed 170 pounds before the feast, and after the feast, I weighed 175 pounds. I was wheeled out of the place in a large wheelchair, which is the reward you get for eating the quadruple bypass. I believe that people who weigh 350 pounds or more eat for free when they weigh-in to verify their weight.   Believe it or not, I'm usually very health conscious, so this isn't a place I'd recommend going to on a regular basis, but I think it's something you should try if you're a hard-core foodie (and you don't have high blood pressure or cardiovascular disease)."}
{"text":"1st time at the heart attack and i must we were not disappointed. We ordered the chili cheese flatliner fries one word amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the concept.  It's close by.  The owner is a nice guy.  But there's a huge problem here, as others have opined - the burgers are HORRIBLE.  The bun is disgusting (if you can't even get the bun right, that's pretty sad) and the fried burger patty is bland, fatty, greasy, and not the least bit appetizing.  The fries are OK, helped taste-wise by the fact they're cooked in lard.  But they're nothing to write home about.  Everything else is all about the gimmick.. beer, booze, broads, cigarettes.  The burgers are EXPENSIVE.  Sorry, but I just can't come back.  If the burgers were even half-decent, I think this place would be a huge success.  But they're not, and I'd bet that repeat business is not nearly what it could be."}
{"text":"What a strange little place! The atmosphere was clean. The nurses were friendly but a little ditsy (both our drinks and food was delivered to the wrong table). I went there expecting the most amazing burger and shake since they are so proud of the calories. Totally and completely not worth the calories. I wouldn't mind the calories if the food was amazing but it was sub-par at best. I had a single bypass burger and a brownie shake. I have had better burger and shakes at Steak and Shake. My 20 year old son was with me and he was less than impressed too."}
{"text":"The cheeseburgers atmosphere drinks were amazing! We will definitely come back for round 2 very very soon! The service was outstanding with a friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I saw this place on TV and said... I have to gain 50 pounds to eat for free! So... I did. And I had a Quadruple By pass burger. I wouldn't regain the weight for the free burger, but I would eat here again!"}
{"text":"Had a great time. Fun atmosphere and experience. Adorable waitresses and very good service. Food was decent, but you pay for the novelty. We had a blast!!"}
{"text":"The burger was delicious add lard cooked fries and a coke yum. The burger cones on a big bun with chili onion and tomato. Those diners who don't finish their burger get three spanks with the paddle in front of all the customers so order carefully. Prices are very reasonable and all the kids there really liked the mandatory chicken dance. Great crew working here  They explained the menu and talked me into a Jell-O shot that comes in a big plastic shot tube."}
{"text":"Mediocre food with semi poor staff services during my experience. It's an experience though!"}
{"text":"Great place to visit , the nurses are entertaining  and very friendly . The milk shakes are amazing . I will give  this place six stars if I could"}
{"text":"We had walked by this place a year ago, but didn't go in because my husband had just had gastric sleeve surgery (a few months earlier he could have eaten for free haha). This year we went in and shared the single burger. Our server was \"Nurse\" Lola, and she was awesome. All the girls are friendly, outgoing, helpful, and we loved the place. What a cleaver concept, you have to admit...the hospital gowns and wine on the IV pole are pretty funny. The food is, as advertised, full of fat and calories. So, if you're dieting there won't be anything for you. If you don't finish your food, you will be spanked with a paddle. But, it's all in fun and a great photo opp. I also had onion rings (huge basket) and the milkshake, which was Cake Batter flavor with maple syrup added. Wow...did that cure my sweet tooth! We had a great time, and Lola was great, we even took pictures with her before leaving."}
{"text":"I had to come to this place because it was advertised on Food network! What an experience!  3 scales to weigh yourself--which I didn't partake in. You are dressed in a hospital gown as you walk in to enjoy this very caloric meal and there are posters and tvs all advertising the lack of a weight obsession makes for a happy camper.  My friend and I shared the single burger and onion rings. If the burgers came with the actual fillings of a typical burger--meat, cheese, lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and pickles--I might have said it was a delicious, fatty burger. But it didn't...no lettuce or pickles to take the brunt of the greasiness of the burger and to cut through, basically, all the fried grease of the onion ring as well. They didn't even have HOT SAUCE! For shame--it really needed it.  I understand the concept--Heart Attack Grill--but STILL!!! Flavor and tartness would've have rounded up this meal in a MUCH more positive light. Also, getting the chance to order a drink out of IV lines--alas, that is a regret saved for another time. I will probably come back because the ambiance of the whole place was funky--but I will be bringing my own bottle of hot sauce next time!"}
{"text":"Came here for my bday after wanting to go for years. Definitely lived up to the hype for me. Seating can feel awkward if you're seated at the windows leading to Fremont Street experience. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"I walked in with my sister and my boyfriend.  We wanted to see a menu before sitting down.  We were greeted by someone in a way-too-tight nurse's costume.  Every single man in the place turned around and stared at us.  Every man in there sat alone at the counter with a beer.  I wondered if we had accidentally walked into a strip club, based on the layout, the customers, and the wait staff.  The little nurse politely but loudly told us the menu was painted on the wall.  Heart attack burgers, \"flat line fries\", unfiltered lucky strikes and buckets of beer.  That's it.  So we turned around and politely walked out as fast as we could."}
{"text":"I Loved the theme of this place!   I am a real nurse, and was soooo interested in visiting this place after seeing a special on The Travel channel so when I came to Vegas of course I had to poke my head in and see what it was all about.  Everything on the menu is so fattening and over at least 1500 calories, If your over 350 lbs you will get a free burger (they weigh you to validate your claims)  so if your on a diet or your easily offended by spankings (If you don't finish all your food) Or sexy nurses then this is not the place for you.  I had a double burger  with fries and it was over 3000 calories!  It was delicious. The patties were huge and so juicy with all that melted cheese good God! with a coke on the side I was in food Heaven. God Bless the food God! I also tried there Slushies' with 3 shots of vodka which came in a really cute pill bottle that you get to keep for a souvenir. Glad I can say I tried this place. My only complaint was that the Bald Dr. was not there! I would have loved to see him walking around auscultating peoples heart and lung sounds while there eating!"}
{"text":"This place is fun. Good music. The nurses spank you if you do not finish your food, which drew an audience from people passing by outside. Food portions are oversized. The food is not great, but it is something you should try at least once.  I ordered the 1/2 pound chilli dog with fries, a jello shot and vanilla butterfat milkshake. I sure felt like dying later, but really did not want to be spanked."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is fun,  waitress was hot,  funny when people get spanked.  But the food isn't all that.  Go for the fun,  not the food."}
{"text":"Burger was very good. Dare I say it-I finally got too much bacon! Real sodas (imported from Mexico of course) and BIG cans of beer including some brands you just don't see in the West (I had a Genessee!). Only disappointment was the limp, soggy, greasy fries. Other than the possibility of contracting a real heart attack from eating here regularly I heartily recommend it!"}
{"text":"Went here two weeks ago with the family, as we wanted to experience the lard burgers first hand. Really, the burgers here are just okay and the fries are not good. Coke in a bottle is nice, so they got that going for them.  If you need to test belly room with triple or quadruple size burgers, go for it. Believe I'll head elsewhere for a good single."}
{"text":"September 29, 2012 Saturday - 6:45 PM dinner 2 adults   Atmosphere - 4 stars Food - 4 stars Service - 3 stars  Background - Heard about this place, and we walking around Fremont so we had to try it.  Atmosphere - Dinner feel but sterile almost.  Lots of parody posters of their brand.  The whole gown thing is funny.  Food   Appetizer - nope    Main Course - The single burger was good, the fries were warm at best.    Dessert - none for me.  Service - The whole gown thing is a mess, some people get help putting on and taking them off from the host, others have to do it themselves.  Our waitress was very scatter.  Them using iPads or something similar add the staff walking a \"texting\", looks very un-organized.  Probably is very effective but it did not come across that way to me.  Future - Once was probably enough."}
{"text":"I went to Heart Attack Grill Saturday, Nov 5th at 8pm.  It was fairly busy at that time still.  I had never been there before at this location or any others. The atmosphere was seemingly cheap and temporary, like they hadn't completely finished moving in.  They had video screens and wall coverings that set the tone. The food was pretty good.  It's by no means the best burger and fries I've ever had.  It actually tasted like it was bad for me though!  Not that it's a bad thing...that IS their theme...food that tastes good and is bad for you.  And I love that!! It's refreshing that a restaurant will go against all the outside pressure of healthier food on the menu that some other burger joints get bashed for.  And the fact they give free food to people who weigh more than 350 pounds...I love it! However...my rating is only 2 stars... The service was not very good.  When our order was being brought out the server didn't even know if she had the correct table.  She set a burger in front of my buddy.  He grabbed it the burger, started to take out the wooden stake holding it together, and was going to start putting condiments on it.  The server then was very confused if she had the right order at the right table.  Right before this, they had attempted to give us the order for the table next to us BTW.  The server would not listen to me when I was telling her that I think the other burger/fries in her had was probably mine.  She instead grabbed the burger from in front of my buddy (after he had already handled it of course), and then proceeded to attempt to give it to another table.  Now isn't that some sort of heath code violation...setting food in front of a customer, the customer handles the food, then it's okay to give to ANOTHER customer at ANOTHER table??  I don't think so. And their fries FYI are for a specific fry-type-lover.  Yes, they are cooked in \"lard\", so that makes them taste different, but their fries are the kind of fries that do not get crispy.  They are the soggy, soft type of fries.  So if you are looking for the crispy fries, don't order them. Bacon was the best part. I'd go back, but only with friends who want to try it.  I'd never go back on my own just for the food or experience."}
{"text":"We go every year and take new family members so they can get the spanking from the server. The atmosphere is good and the drinks. The food is ok. We get the Octuple just to take pictures."}
{"text":"The burger was four stars but the fries were barely three stars. The theme and dedication of the wait staff was a five star. Also a high grade for entertainment value and great videos that promote and glorify all kinds of politically incorrect but legal vices such as smoking and drinking. Our friend was publicly weighed and was over 400 pounds. He was rewarded with free burgers.  We must wear hospital gowns and the waitresses are dressed as sexy nurses. This was a fun place to eat. Beware, if you don't finish your burger, you may be paddled by the nurse."}
{"text":"Great place for a tourist. While the food is about as unhealthy as it comes its also the best tasting food! Love the uniforms and attention to details with the hospital theme!"}
{"text":"Loved the food, loved the theme , but the star was our waitress Rikki. She was fantastic full of personality. And a great  spokesperson for this restaurant.  Of course when you don't finish your burger you get spanked Three Times. And I didn't finish. (Of course I could have) very fun hearted place. The burgers were full of bacon and cheese. You have to try there double."}
{"text":"Ok, I know from watching all the information about this place its not suppose to be the best you have ever gone, but the atmospehre was fun and entertaining, but the food was horrible, too greasy, the chili on the burgers doesnt help any either, I know its not suppose to be the best food around, but have some taste. The chili cheese fries were alright, but you dont get much of a choice on drinks, you dont get free refills, you would think that after offering that you might get water free. I would probably not go there again, but we tried it and that is all."}
{"text":"A pretty cool experience for vegas. Neat atmosphere that everywhere you look there is something different. You get a chance to see a lot of people who get spanked. The food is ok.. it's clearly not healthy but what do you expect. We each got a single which is 1/2 pound by the way and split chili cheese fries and left stuffed. Each burger has a healthy helping of chili on top of 1/2 pound burger.  We saw a few heros try doubles and triples only to see them get spanked for not finishing there meal.  Look it's vegas... it's worth a try then go down Freemont and see all the freaks trying to separate you from your money"}
{"text":"The hamburgers here are humongous!  If you don't finish your food you get a spanking so be careful what you order. Great place to go with grown up friends while in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been curious to try this place ever since the first person died there. And this past weekend, I was finally able to make that dream come true. It's not on strip, but on Fremont in the downtown/old strip area. They are CASH ONLY!! Theres an ATM inside with a $.75 fee (which is the cheapest I've seen anywhere in Vegas)  Let me just say up front that I weigh between 115 and 125 lbs, depending on how far apart my last 3 meals have been spaced apart, and am no where near the 350lbs you need to be to eat free. In fact, I'm no where near what an average person of my height should weigh to be normal, but w/e.  Any ways, If you have heart problems, I suggest you stay at least a mile away from this place. If you're what I like to call a fairy, and eat small portions of pretty food, I suggest you stay away from this place. If you're what I like to call an elf, and eat gross things like vegetables and sprouts and w/e, I suggest you stay away from this place. If you do come in, be aware that keeping in line with the theme of the place, they're gonna put you in a silly hospital gown while you eat. And all the waitresses are dressed in sexy nurse outfits.  The menu is simple, Like at In 'n Out, if you know the place. Theres 4 cheeseburgers, 1 to 4 patties, with or without bacon. Fries, Coke, water, beer, liquor and lucky strike cigarettes (by pack and by carton). I'm not kidding on that last part. The patties are all a half pound each, and they pile the cheese and onions on these babies.  Being a glutton, but not very big, I only got the double bypass burger (yeah, they're named like that) sans bacon and tomato and an order of flat-liner fries. The food came within 5 minutes and after looking at the burger and thinking, oh crap, I started eating. The burger itself was pretty good. definitely not the best, and no where near as good as a \"gourmet\" burger, but better than any fast food place and a lot of small burger joints. I was really surprised by the quality of the bun. Now, if I had gotten just the single bypass, this might have been a completely enjoyable experience. But I didn't, so about half way through the burger it quickly went from fun to wtf. By the last quarter I was starting to fade. And I couldn't even get the last bite down. Now normally, I can eat a burger with a pound of meat on it and still get a few beers in. The biggest problem I think, was the amount of cheese near the end. It was just too heavy. So I threw in the towel.  After some research I found out that their biggest burger, a quadruple bypass with bacon comes out to over 8000 calories. Meaning that the double without bacon is somewhere around 3500. I'm glad I didn't find that out till AFTER. Either way, I might come back here next time I'm in Vegas, but stick with the single patty."}
{"text":"We went with a bunch of friends when we were hanging out at Fremont Street. The food the portions are huge and the food is really really good. They put you in a gown like a hospital down it's really cool the environment is fun. If your blasted like I was at you would have even more you have a better time. overall our waitress is really really nice the food was delicious and if you're in Vegas I definitely would recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting!  Would never go back, food terrible, service rude, can't imagine there are enough tourists to keep this place open for much longer.  Stay far far away!!"}
{"text":"Avoid. Service is pathetically slow, burgers are a disaster, and their onion rings are an exercise in mediocrity. It's a meal that wouldn't be out of place on the menu of Air Koryo.  The kitsch factor of the place wears off pretty rapidly, with your meal being constantly interrupted by the sound of wooden paddles being spanked against the arse of patrons who've not finished their meals. That's presuming you can get over passers by staring into the place, like you're some kind of zoological or circus oddity.  The inside of the place also feels soulless - as if you've stepped into a morgue. Outfits of their female staff are pretty demeaning to boot.  Frankly, if I wanted to waste my money and time there's far better places on Fremont St to do so and actually enjoy it."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD, YELPERS!!  What is WRONG with you??  I had read about the Phoenix HAG years and years ago in a magazine and always thought it would be a fun place to visit... so when I stumbled upon their front door in Vegas this past weekend - I was beside myself.  It DOES exist and I am HERE!  I took a few pictures, ogled the menu, and went back to the hotel to convince my husband that we had to come back and eat the next day.  We did.  First of all - it is a THEMED restaurant.  If you don't want to play along, go somewhere else.  The waitresses are dressed as sexy nurses.  They were all cute, personable, and helpful with ordering and playing along with the theme.  I have a problem with some of the reviewers knocking their intelligence level.  If they forgot a drink, if they never came back to your table - fine, comment on service.  Don't call them stupid.  Enough of that rant.  As a diner,  you are required to wear a hospital gown.  Its part of the theme.  Again - if you are unhappy playing along, don't eat here.  Second - the food and drinks.  Don't want to eat a greasy burger loaded with cheese and lard fried french fries?  Maybe you should skip the place called \"Heart Attack Grill\" and go eat a salad at the place across the street?  Its a theme, people.  Go with it.  How can you possibly complain about the food at a place that has cigarettes, YES - cigarettes, on the menu?  I enjoyed my burger.  Very much so.  But I'm a protein hound and after tossing the bun and enjoying a fat wad of crispy and delicious bacon and a 1/2 lb burger patty with grilled onion - I was one happy customer.  Hubs enjoyed his burger as well.  If you're looking for a gourmet burger with a fancy cheese and special toppings with a homemade bun with your initials on it... don't eat here.  If you're looking for a fun place with good burgers that will fill you up, want to have a good time, laugh a lot, and try some good drinks... then tie on a hospital gown, because Heart Attack Grill is the place to be.  As for the drinks - I was VERY satisfied.  I had the Strawberry Shortcake slushie and loved it.  Very tasty, very potent.  And I will be coming back just to pick up a drink in a keepable to-go cup while I roam Fremont.  I passed on the milkshake - too rich for me... but butterfat won't kill you, people.  I won't get into a nutritional lecture on Yelp, but the sugar in that drink will do more harm to your body than the butter.  Or the animal fat that your fries were drenched in.  But I digress... for now.  Third - the atmosphere:  its fun!  That's what its supposed to be.  Kitschy, silly, and fun!  And I think this place totally succeeds with that.  Did I mention there are cigarettes on the menu?  Okay then.  Grab a group of friends, a camera, and enjoy an entertaining dinner at The Heart Attack Grill.  The guys (or brave enough girls) can hop on the scale for a \"before\" estimate and hop on AFTER all your drinks and dining for the \"after\".  We even witnessed a guy who met the 350# requirement... the scale has a siren and a flashing red light to inform everyone within the vicinity that SOMEONE is eating for free!    Overall, just go in with a good attitude.  Know what you're getting into... and what you're going in for.  Try the slushies.  Get a burger.  Take pictures.  And have fun.  That's what its about.  And by the way.... this is the ONLY Heart Attack Grill in existence now.  It relocated out of Phoenix to Dallas... and then Dallas to Vegas.  So this is it.  Try it and enjoy!  And don't forget to bring cash... no credit cards here!"}
{"text":"First off, I love In-N-Out so that's my baseline.  This is more of an experience restaurant than a good burger joint.  The burger was a little dry, and the fries were great for my first serving but soggy for the second.  But it's the atmosphere.  Our server was great- not super hot, but cute.  But very professional, stayed in her \"role\" for the expeience as our nurse and she took care of us.  I only got a single but was amazed at this girl across from us who must have weight a buck-o-five and she downed a double.  when she came in she was all cheerful but when she was done eating she looked all haggard... I guess that's a good thing."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what people are complaining about on here. The burger was pretty good. It wasn't some cheap, inedible, abomination. It tasted much better than a McDonalds burger or something similar to that. The chili on it was like the kind you put on nachos, but it still tasted good.  Everyone at my table enjoyed their burger a lot. The milkshake tasted more like chocolate pudding than a normal shake, but it was still very good. The fries were tasted fine, nothing really special.   The atmosphere is great though. Tons of funny movie poster parodies with food puns. You go here once and never again. But that one time is really great."}
{"text":"NOTE: if you're super PC or a snowflake, or have no sense of humor, don't come in. It is a slap in the face to the hyper PC culture on the news and current hyper PC and ultra biased liberal arts university culture.   Honestly, I cannot think of a time I've had more fun in a restaurant in recent years! I was scared to go in because I didn't want to wear the hospital gown, but I got over it and had a blast!   This is essentially like a dinner theater, it is a total show and like being in a different universe, once you step back outside, it is as though you came out of a bizarre 1980's movie, it's that stark of a contrast.  The food is not mind-blowing, but decent overall, it's not cheap, but keep in mind your not just paying for food when you come here, you're paying for the experience, the show, if you don't like that kind of thing, don't come here.   My hot dog was great, so much so that everytime I eat hotdog now, I think about that hotdog, it didn't seem very high quality written I ate it, not until I came home and ate other hotdogs. :-( The chili and cheese was okay, but the french roll bun and hot dog were very high quality. My husband said his burger was good, he didn't have the bun because he is on a keto diet, which this perfect is pretty awesome if you are keto, he said the meat and bacon were very good. The onion rings were good, I could definitely taste the difference with the lard, and contrary to the popular notion, lard will not give you a coronary necessarily, it is one of the best frying oils, much healthier than soy or canola. That alone is selling point for me(by the way I am in NO WAY saying this place is healthy, it's obviously not! Just merely that lard has an unfair rap due to the war on fat from the 1970's on.).   I loved the whole experience, I enjoyed my food, I didn't finish, but no they didn't threaten to spank me, it was 100% tongue-in-cheek, from the costumes, to the tasteless music videos and posters, it is a lot of fun, and honestly, in today's society, we need people to have fun and have a stinking sense of humor more without picking the experience apart. Just and enjoy! For $30, we honestly got 3x's they food of most burger joints.   God Bless ~Amy   PS: There is a guy who has complained about the security guard not letting them bring in their drinks, I was there when it happened, and this is true, his wife had a lemonade cup that they were unwilling to dispose of when the security guard asked nicely, this he had to deny them entry. The security guard was doing his job which was to stop people from bringing in outside drinks( which in Vegas is usually alchohol), I talked to the security guard for 30 minutes before going in and he was beyond pleasant, he was super friendly, but he was all business when dealing with people trying to bring in drinks, that was his job, to stop people from bringing in drinks. The man who wrote that review below was very disrespectful to the said security guard and very rude with some unsavory words, not the other way around."}
{"text":"Fun tourist restaurant! There's a giant scale outside so you can weigh yourself before you go in. Anyone 350lbs or more eats free. When you first walk in you're greeted and given a hospital gown which they ask you not to take off. The food is pretty good. My husband and I split the single burger, the hot dog and fries...it was so much food that I only finished my half of the burger. We both ordered shakes too. They were delicious! My strawberry shake was topped with actual butter!   The service here was absolutely amazing! Everyone was extremely friendly and our server was the best.  Prices are decent too, about what you'd expect to pay at a typical diner and its cash only. It was actually the cheapest meal we had while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Once we saw this place we couldn't pass it up !    Such a fun idea, we were dressed up in hospital gowns and the waitresses dressed as naughty nurses.  Stopped in with some friends, had drinks (naughty shakes, frozen dreamsicles) with the 3.4 oz alcohol shots served in prescription bottles(even had your name printed on them) and shared some chili cheese fries.    Definitely have to got back and try the jello shot in the syringe and Wine *red or white* with IV Bag and Pole!"}
{"text":"this place brings horrible to a new level. for starters, i understand that its there fad thing with the gowns but i mean.... why say everyone has to wear one... then ask if its okay.... we came in before the rest of our group and he needed to use the restroom so when he went the \"nurse\" asked what are you doing like he was doing something wrong.... then made me go back on the other side because you cant be accross it.... okay fine.... whatever.... then they kept asking over and over do you wanna sit do you wanna sit etc...... and we explained were waiting on the rest of our party. then find out they only have mexican (real sugar coke) or bottled water (2 dollars each for either) unless you want a shake with a pad of butter on it.... or alcohol.  then we find out that you can split the single but not the double, okay thats fine that didnt bother me... but heres what did the fact that it was followed up with, if i or anyone here sees you get it and split it we will box up your food and ask you to leave.  really? its really just a horrible place....  as for the food, it was OK nothing special at all, just greasy.... and the milk shake had a weird chewy butter texture.... gross. (also must confess im not a fan of the pad of butter on top) besides that, the fries were OK chili was OK  just overall bleck.... wouldnt go back....ever."}
{"text":"I've been waiting almost a year before my GF finally agreed to take me to the Heart attack grill; I'm so conflicted; I wanted this to be the best burger in Vegas but it's definitely not; it's actually pretty close to the bottom of that list. On the other hand if you want a dining experience you get your money's worth so that is where I'm conflicted;   First the food; everything is super greasy; cooked in lard/fat and there is no such thing as \"diet\" or \"healthy\" here; that would normally be music to my ears and as we were sat and handed our menus I could just see myself going crazy ordering one of the huge coronary burgers but I've been losing weight and didn't want that to stop so I stuck with the regular sized burger and I'm so glad I did;   The burger was a very thin patty cooked way past well done and could have been used as a hockey puck. I like my burgers thick and juicy so this was highly disappointing; the bacon was left on the grill about 5 minutes too long as well and the burnt texture really distracted from the rest of the burger.  My GF complained it was by far the worst burger she had ever eaten and I disagree with that but only because I've eaten some really bad burgers in my time; I do have to say this one is going on that bad list though! the condiments on the table (mayo kept at room temp is scary)  The Fries were super greasy to the point they were soft. I know it's the theme here but come on guys you have to go with what tastes good over what is the most unhealthy thing we can put on the menu and I was disappointed with both the burger and fries.  The milk shake or lard shake or the artery clogging concoction they are calling a milk/lard shake tasted the best but that had a lot to do  with the fact I spent the last 4 hours outside on Fremont Street watching a parade and the coolness of texture oozing down my throat, yes oozing as our meal lasted about 40 mins and the shake didn't melt much you can only guess how much lard they used to make the buttermilk shake;  out of everything this was the best but my suggestion is to pick the vanilla over the chocolate one as it was just too rich for a regular persons pallet;   The other thing we tried was a syringe full of a frozen shot/slushy; it wasn't bad either and I wish we had ordered more than one or that they had more than one flavor available at a time; I really think they would sell more of these things if your customers could each order a flavor and pass it along  to the other people at the table;   Ok, so now the experience.  The food is lacking in taste and quality so why is this place so crazy popular?  In a country as overweight and out of shape as the USA is; this place is popular Because if you weigh a certain amount you eat for free! Walking in you are greeted by nurses who force you to put a hospital gown on and walk you over to a table; yes the staff is on the OMG hot side so if you have a nurse fantasy this is a good place for you; and guys word of advice is your girlfriend asks if she could work there don't hesitate, just say yes with much enthusiasm as she is judging your answer and response time;  Oh and if you aren't able to finish your burger the wait staff will beat you with a wooden paddle; after what happened to me at another restaurant I was more than happy to point out that my GF didn't finish and that I would tip extra if there was a bruise; you would be surprised how eager they are to whip you like a dog; my GF got one spank for every bite she left so keep that in mind once ordering (yes, I finished mine and was saved)   The entire set up is a bizzaro world hospital; there are no healthy products, you get chastised for asking for a diet coke so don't bother trying.  There are great reproductions on the walls of classic pop culture icons and movies all with a burger/hospital twist so feel free to walk around and look/snap photos; you don't want to miss anything;  the entire event was fun and cheesy in a good sense;  if you have some big hearty eaters in your group they might enjoy trying to take down a double/triple coronary burger but all in all you can easily stand on the outside of the restaurant and peek through the shades/door to see everything of importance just take my word for it you will be sadly disappointed with the food as my GF and I were.    All in all our meal was expensive (we did buy a t-shirt) and I won't mention other restaurants by name but if you want a burger you can go elsewhere and get a great burger at a huge savings; I would only recommend coming here if you want to do a food challenge and or you have a nurse fetish/like to be whipped;    I still haven't figured out how I'm going to rate this restaurant; I want to say 1.5 star for the food and maybe a 3.5 for the ambiance/experience.  So I guess if I average that out it's a 2.5 star restaurant? It seems low but I'm sticking with it.  I'd love to have given it higher marks but even sexy nurses couldn't save the low quality of food"}
{"text":"And now ladies and gentlemen... the single worst establishment I've ever had the pleasure of eating at. Heart Attack Grill has ZERO redeeming qualities. There is not a single reason for me to even get close to giving this place anything more than one star. This is one place that makes me wish Yelp would allow a zero or negative star rating.   Now, to preface this review... I'm not an idiot... I know that this place is \"The Heart Attack Grill\" so I went in prepared for greasy and unhealthy food but hoped it'd be fun and even though unhealthy, maybe taste alright. Whoa, was I ever wrong to hope for that. They group their burgers by how many patties there are... starting out with the Single Bypass burger (one pattie) and going up to the Quadruple Bypass burger (four patties). Being a little more on the conservative end, I went with the Single Bypass burger and a side order of fries. My Dad came along for the fun and he got the same... for the purposes of this review I should tell you that my Dad is a machine, he can eat... and he doesn't mind a little grease.   Right as they bring our food out, I immediately get intimidated. The patty of the burger was dripping with fat and the meat used was such low quality (extremely high fat/meat ratio) that the patty didn't even appear to be beef... it had this whitish tint to it that you'd have to see to believe. I've never seen such an unhealthy piece of beef in my life... it doesn't help that they cook it in pure lard either. This was beyond unhealthy, it was disgusting. I feel like if you're making something blatantly unhealthy there should at least be a method to the madness; there should be some attempt at wanting to make it actually taste good (it is food by the way). It just seemed like they were pushing the grease and lard to the absolute maximum just to see how far they can take it. Well I'm not impressed... I took one bite and was instantly grossed out, I actually almost threw up it was so bad. My Dad who can hang with the best of 'em was able to stomach about three bites until he could no longer continue. The second we left the place I turned to my Dad and said \"that's the worst single piece of food I've ever put in my mouth\". I'm not exaggerating when I say that I'd rather eat a dried up piece of dog shit between two buns than a Heart Attack Grill burger.   The only thing worse than the food is the tacky and over the top waitresses. They wander around in little nurses outfits often times with their underwear quite visible, and their whole bar area has a slanted mirror to actually encourage you to look up their skirts. That'd be fine and all, except I didn't want to look up these skirts. If you're going to have your wait staff dress sexy, you better make sure they're worth looking at in the first place. These girls were a little rough around the edges... most of them had that 'ex-stripper' look; and I could have sworn that one of them had bullet wounds on her stomach... that's not a joke.  P.S. I actually dry heaved while writing this review just thinking about my fat drenched burger.   DO NOT GO HERE."}
{"text":"Fun environment and theme. The fries were tasty. The negative, the burgers were horrible. Way over cooked and a funny taste. Definitely not fresh. Frozen for sure. Almost like a soy bean taste. The cost was also ridiculous. Two burgers and a order of fries was $30. Never again. One and done. My wife and truly believe it's the worst burger we've ever eaten. Sad!"}
{"text":"I saw Heart Attack Grill on Travel Channel \"Most Extreme Restaurants\". While visiting Fremont Street, we decided to check it out. I came more for the EXPERIENCE than food. It's not a place for gourmet food. There's a giant scale outside of this restaurant. If you weigh more than 350lbs you get free food. We were seated immediately but Heart Attack Grill got busy very fast. Once you enter, guest must put on a hospital style gown. I got a single bypass burger/fries.These burgers are massive and calorized out. It's part of the experience of going to one of the world's unhealthiest restaurant. The burger and fries were decent. It wasn't the best ever or worst. I was surprised it was decent. The waitresses are dressed as nurses. I dreaded getting spanked for not finishing my food (lol). The table food was put on me. Yes, it happed I was spanked in front of the restaurant (lol) Shy/Fun/Yolo/What happens in Vegas moment all in one! Heart Attack Grill has unique menu items other than burgers (limited). Our waitress was very attentive and nice. I came here for the experience and it lived up to the hype for me personally. It's not a place you come to every day but it's a fun experience IMO for first timers. Heart Attack Grill is a cool experience while visiting Vegas Fremont Street Experience.  CASH ONLY!!!!!!! Now on to the GYM."}
{"text":"Okey dokey...i had Really big hopes for this place. I LOVE MEAT!  Good things were: Food was ok,meat could use a bit more flavor and less charcoal condiment we're good, fries we're ok, onion rings we're ok too. Portions we're good! The decor was fun and cute. The slushies with shots were really kewl. We had 18 people half of which were on the fluffy side...lol...the wait staff were friendly and on point. The best part was the spanking at the end *I purposely didn't finish my burger* some swift smacks I was hoping she'd break the paddle.  Ok NOW THE BAD. I have a service dog named Larry *an actual service dog not a pet in disguise * so they first said no dogs aloud...ok he's service dog...still was asked what he does, which is embarrassing when there is 17 people with you..so I actually whispered it in her ear and she still had to ask her boss...like 3 times...then we sat down and all waitresses except 1 came over to question me about larry...my boyfriend looked up the nevada state law and they arnt aloud to ask what condition the service dog is for and can't discriminate against someone that has one which is what happened... we were fed up..the only reason we stayed was because of our party....finally they let us eat...Larry sat at my feet and did his job like he was supposed too...it really was the last straw to a horrible stay in Vegas... unfortunately I don't think we'll be back...ive been looking forward to this place for years...:("}
{"text":"We didn't eat here for fear of not finishing our food and having to get spanked lol but we did order the giant jello syringe shots which were good and strong! Wearing the hospital gown was fun and it was fun watching other people receive their punishment for not finishing their meals haha."}
{"text":"The THEME is Awesome, but the food is OK.  If you are looking for a different place to eat and people watch, then this is the perfect place!"}
{"text":"I LOVED this place. Christina and I were in Vegas and I was showing her the Fremont Street Exprerience.  We needed to eat something, and we had walked past this place with the giant industrial scale outside. We loved it and so we went in. First off, a nurse greets you at the door and you get your hospital gown and wrist band. We decided the best place to eat was at the counter. I gotta tell you, if Nurse Tracy is on that day, and she's behind that bar, run get a seat and strap in, you are going to have a blast.    We ordered the single burger, fries and each of us had the jello shot, which comes in this RIDICULOUSLY large hypodermic needle. NurseTracy was game to give us oral injections while we photographed it.    I ordered this amazing orange creamcicle shake.   Um, I got a spanking from a hawt nurse.  We went for the touristy aspect of the experience, but it was so much more. We had a blast and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Was killing time in Vegas wandering around and stumbled across the Heart Attack Grill. I remembered all the fuss surrounding this restaurant when it was new and figured what the hell, let's give it a go. The schtick of this restaurant is pretty amusing in that everything is super fatty, you wear a gown when you go in, and all the waitresses are dressed like nurses.  Problem is the food itself is exceptionally mediocre. My burger was super dry, which is sort of unbelievable with how fatty everything was. It was like they figured out a way to get all the grease out of the burger and instead have it pool on the bottom of your basket. Maybe I went on an off night, who knows.  The only thing that saved the whole thing was my server was unbelievably entertaining. Everything else? Totally skippable."}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant featured on Showtimes 7 deadly sins. I thought the owner had a hilarious yet disturbing view on food and fat America so I decided to investigate myself.   You walk in and are greeted by cheesy nurses and made to put on a gown.. Fine I will play along. After seated I was greeted by a friendly sexy nurse, she explained menu. The menu is basically a chili dog, chili fries, or a burger with as many bacon slices or beef patties as you want.  My stomach turned as I ordered a cheese burger, I could smell the lard thick in the air. My date ordered a shake and a orangesicle freeze, I tried a sip of each, yikes they were so thick and rich they tasted like pure whipping cream with massive amounts of sugar, not palatable. I choked down bite by bite of my greasy disgusting burger. I had a front row view of the paddle station, person after person was marched up there by a sadistic asian woman dressed as a nurse. She winded up and swung with all her might, she inflicted as much damage as she could with each swing. (keep the bull whip away from this one) The burger was massive, & greasy, so very very greasy. Thank god I brought someone to help me finish or I would have been paddled myself.  I was most disappointed that I did not get to meet the Dr, I arrived too late. I can't rate the place any higher because well... its totally disgusting. Heart Attack grill is a fun theme and makes a mockery of American Obesity. My day was made when got to see a huge guy weigh himself on the livestock scale, as everyone cheered while the sirens rang for his 350+ body.   My stomach hurt the entire car ride home & I vomited in true Roman fashion as soon as I entered my restroom.   Thanks Heart Attack Grill! :D"}
{"text":"Instead of my annual Hooters visit while in Arizona, I thought I would switch it up to Heart Attack Grill! Trashy nurses, unlimited greasy (excuse me, \"lard-y\") fries, good cheesy burgers, unfiltered ciggs and a patient attire; I'm so there!   Before I stepped in, I was blasted with a caution sign on the front doors. The sign(s) read...  \"Caution. This establishment is bad for your health!\" And, \"CASH ONLY\".   Luckily, I did my research in advance so I knew what I wanted.  We were greeted by \"Nurse Alex\". She informed me \"Ladies order first!\". HAG has a limited menu. They only serve water, coke and 2 types of beer (all in glass bottles, except for water). NO diet drinks! The menu is on the wall (single, double, triple and quad patties) AND unfiltered ciggs! You can order unlimited fries; \"fried in lard\" fries! If you eat the triple or quad burger while in the restaurant, you can get wheel chaired out, lol! The burgers are served to you with cheese then you can add your condiments at the condiment-bar.   I love the atmosphere (I appreciate themed places). The gals will dress you up in a patient gown and id wrist band.  They also offer \"eat free\" deals if you weigh 350 lbs or more. And a \"year diet plan\" (see the website for that one), lol.   And a few words from the wise...  Your NOT allowed to share! Eat your own fries and burgers!  If you usually eat a single patty, get a double patty instead! The single patty may not fill you up. Get the pickles at the condiment bar (they are sooo good)! Bring cash! And don't expect a bill/receipt (your waitress will calculate your order on a calculator. So do your own math as well)."}
{"text":"This place was god awful, the Burgers are like shoe leather and always cooked well done  Chilli was greasy and was terrible.   This place is real tourist trap  The fries were decent and the their microbrew beers was undrinkable"}
{"text":"Fun environment but probably the WORST customer service ever!!!!!! we had a party of 20 come in, the screwed up the orders and my friend got a completely different order. The waitress had the nerve to tell us she did not screw up and that it's just to bad and he had to eat it. I was shocked and when I commented, she ran away to get her supervisor. eventually they gave in and corrected the order. Horrible!!!"}
{"text":"We went in as a family just to check out this restaurant since I happened to notice videos about it on Facebook. Since we had dinner reservations later that night we decided to just split a burger or fries and just to have a drink. They said we can split the smallest burger there which we did and we all ordered a drink to have. The food there which is average is not the reason why you go. It's the whole theme of the place, where it is a motto for the customers to eat unhealthy as possible. I even got to do a little karaoke there as well. The whole hospital theme is his hilarious as hell. I really wanted to give this place 4.5 Stars. I would give a three for the food and a 5 for the service and overall theme. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Heart Attack Grill...  Its was my birthday last night, I.m in Vegas and saw this place and thought I would try it out.  Well, I couldn't get a heart attack from this place, what I got was a rude John Basso, dressed up in a doctors outfit, wear a cheap stethascope around his neck.  Mr. John Basso has failed 2 other times in the Heart Attack Grill business  in Chandler AZ and Dallas TX.   He obviously doesn't pay his rent in one article, and only takes cash, no 20 cents charge for a slide of the card, that only people carry on the Fremont experience, very unsafe place of homeless and mental cases running around.   So here is what happened, I am a Registered Nurse, my girl friend is a Event Planner, we work with people all day,  We travel and deal with food servers and customer service all day every day.  So I ordered the triple bypass, the buttery shake, and the waitrass said \"are you going to share it\"?  I said we always share the food, we cut down on portions and tonight we were trying to decrease our calories my girlfriend wanted a bite.   Guess what?   You can't give your girlfriend a bite!!! So the waitress said order something else and I will bring you another little paper boat so you can share. So the place was dirty, floor needed mopping and table was sticky, no towel was seen in a nurses hand, so no skills of sterile fields there.  Burger came, and my girlfriend ordered chili fries recommended by the nurse/waitress. I cut a 2 bite size off my triple bypass burger and she proceeded to eat it.  The waitress came by and said \"he doesn't like you sharing\".  You will have to pack up the food and leave.  So my girlfriend quite politely said \" Let me talk to the manager\".  So we keep eating and here comes Mr. John Basso, he said you have to pay your bill and leave.  I said really you think you can enforce no sharing of food?    He tried to touch our food, and shove it in a bag and threw a receipt on the table, I said were not paying for this, he said you ate some of it, and the girlfriend said just take off the chili fries that sucked anyway.  He said NO!!!  He threatened to call Metro Police.. We said do it.  So he walked away and we took off the gowns and sat there. John Basso came back and said \"So your gonna pay for your food\".  Which is $23 bucks.  I said no Im waiting for the metro police.   So he got a security guard to show up.  I said where is the police?  Obviously he is in the wrong and he said \"Give me fucking 20 bucks and get the fuck out of my grill.  I gave him $20.00 then he didn't want me to take my food.  And he said \"Fuck You!!!.. Well I said \"Fuck you back!!!  Then I bagged up my food and started walking.    I told him he will be reported to social media like this one.. He said \" Go ahead it is just more publicity for me!!!   We walked outside and the security guard was going, wow he called me cause you gave your girlfriend a piece of your hamburger?  I said yes..  He said he has had to come here before for reasons that  were just as weird. So he was on our side.  While walking out we told a few not to eat here.  I think Mr. John Bass is going to have a heart attack, he is rude and has no respect for people in the public, and hates his business.  I think the cash thing is a cover up for all the money he hides from the government. I will contact anyone that will listen about his business, and see if the IRS will find some way to tack him with his bank accounts. Stress is the silent killer increasing heart rates and can cause a stroke at the work place. I would never eat there, and I gave my left overs to a homeless man and woman outside.  This business won't last with his attitude. Oh and he said to me \"I've been in business for 10 years.  Look it up on Wickapedia:  2010 started in Chandler AZ then failed and then Dallas TX then failed.   So he is a liar too.  John Basso shame on you."}
{"text":"My husband saw this restaurant on TV, and  found the place to be fun and entertaining and suggested that we try when we were exploring the Fremont street. I disagreed with him because obesity and health problems due to unhealthy diet are serious social problems in the US so I found their marketing strategy repulsive and offensive. But, I tried to be a bit lighthearted about the issue during our vacation. I have to admit that this place did an excellent marketing job (e.g., eating free if you weigh over 350 pounds, interesting posters on the walls, waitresses' nurse uniform, customers wearing a hospital gown). HOWEVER, after all, this is a restaurant where people go eat. After looking at the menu, there was nothing I wanted to eat there. My husband ordered a chilly hot dog with french fries and soda. The food came out, and it was disgusting. French fries were all burnt. My husband took two bites and he couldn't eat it, and I didn't blame him. Who could? We saw a young guy who got spanked by a waitress because he didn't finish his burger as a punishment. Basically, we paid $20 as an admission fee to this restaurant for the entertainment. This place did an excellent job to stand out, but really needs to work on their food. Come on...how can you mess up hog dogs and fries??? Marketing alone can get you so far."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place is LIT!  The menu is limited but if you love burgers this place is for you!  I am a heavy eater but the single bypass burger with bacon, chili, cheese, onion and tomatoes filled me up!  The burger alone!  I also had a side of fries which could have been a meal it self!  The vanilla shake was awesome however it could have been bigger!  Nice place to go with your bros and your crew!  If you are a light eater not for you!  However they do have a vegan menu!  The ambience is fun!  The doctor and nurse gimmick and you in the hospital gowns completes the atmosphere!  Great place to hang out!"}
{"text":"You can taste your way to the doctor, and yes there's a slab of butter in the milkshake. Food is good but unhealthy, beats fair food I think. You get paddled, gowned, and may get an ivy next to you. The concept is interesting, I chose to experience it but if you work hard to be health conscious, you will get turned off. Sad to see money made from potential health problems. Curiously entertaining but not on a regular basis for me."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place while on Freemont Street in Vegas and gave it a shot  The experience of dining here is a cant miss. There are rules. Wear hospital gown provided during your stay. If you are over 350lbs you only have to buy a drink and you have unlimited eats ( single hamburger or Single Bipass as it's called) and they way you in front of everyone for verifications. If you eat the Quadruple Bipass or higher completely, they will wheel you out in a wheelchair. You can share the single Bipass but nothing larger. The double Bipass and larger, if you do not finish the burger, your nurse ( waitress dressed as a nurse) will take you to the front window and in front of the entire restaurant and onlookers from the street, you will be given 3 seats by a paddle.   We shared the single Bipass and fries. The burger was good, it comes with chili which was a good mix with the bacon that comes with it. We didn't have any trouble finishing it. But we did witness many punishments which were quite funny.   Price wasn't to bad for the experience.  We would go back if we were in the area"}
{"text":"Really wanted to check this place out but the 2 girls at the door were so rude we turned right around & took our business elsewhere. Didn't plan 2 eat at Dicks!"}
{"text":"' So how many pounds do you think I'll gain from one of their burgers? oohh... and with their lard fries?? ..I guess I'll take the chance!'  These are the words that I said to pump myself up for what I thought would be a burger worth the weight gain.. That didn't quite happen, not because I have a good metabolism but because they had NO BEEF! This was on a Saturday afternoon..  This was strike one.  Strike two: Went back, pumped myself up again, had the burger and was completely disappointed. The atmosphere was lacking, the fries were not memorable and the beef was just off in flavor.  All this unhappiness and I am still trying to work out the extra pounds.  2 stars for effort."}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant on tv...so I had to try today since I was waking downtown Las Vegas.  - I ordered the Double Bypass burger, gross.  The bun was nothing special and the hamburger patties were tasteless and cold.  Pros: chicks wear sexy nurse uniforms.  Obese people eat for free.  Cons: burgers look awesome but taste like crap.  Note: you go because it is a novelty type place...don't expect your overpriced cheeseburgers to blow you away...it won't."}
{"text":"If you want to feel sick to your stomach, Heart Attack Grill is the restaurant for you! A place where they celebrate obesity with free mediocre quality food for anyone weighing over 350lbs may seem like a paradise but Heart Attack Grill fails to deliver anything but clogged arteries. Dry bun, greasy burger patty and barely melted cheese,  doesn't taste of quality and honestly not worth the drive over there. Vibe is weird with sexy nurse waitresses that spank you if you do not finish your food. If you have a hospital and/or heart attack fetish then you'll like this place. Otherwise, go literally anywhere else."}
{"text":"I was there in December 2017. Very fun place. I ate just a little hamburger. Beef is cooked tender and bread is not compact. You can eat a huge burger with 5 or more steaks.  Also you eat in music and when your mouth is empty you can sing : there is a karaoke and you can also go upstairs, take the microphone and being the new singer of downtown Las Vegas! you have a personal very cute and handsome ! You enter as in a hospital but be sure that it's only for a comedy. You will enjoy your food. It's a good experience. Much more than playing or gambling, I think, I'm not a player so I can't say much about pleasure on Casino tables. I prefer foods on tables ! And after lunch I was really in a good mood, not sick."}
{"text":"i don't like the taste of lard, but i love sexy/funny servers & gimmicks.  i got the double cheeseburger w/10 pieces of bacon. it was a nice, meaty, proper burger w/a nice roll/bun.   when the fries arrived i smelled a nasty funk; it must be the lard.  they tasted funky & looked ugly.  my brother thought they tasted normal.  i would never get the fries again for myself.  i was very impressed  w/the selection of tall boy malt liquors on the menu & i got a schlitz . i felt dizzy & discombobulated upon leaving( had to be the schlitz & grub).  this place is outta control, w/super-fun staff & i will visit everytime.  i may just drink at the bar or just eat a single cheeseburger cuz the menu is even more simple than In N Out(wish they had chili & fried chicken) .  we had a window seat & tourists were taking pictures of us & laughing."}
{"text":"The heart attack grill is a fun place to go if you don't care about a diet. When you first go in there is a big scales to weigh yourself before and after your meal.  They also have a sign that says over 350 pounds you eat free. This is a greasy burger Americanized restaurant. I enjoyed my time here but wouldn't recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"I want to give this place more stars just because it's fun and kitschy; in a good way, but the food was ok.  I would definitely say that you should visit simply because why not.....not every place dresses you in a hospital gown, serves you wine from an IV or spanks you for not eating all your food. These aren't little taps either. You can hear it! Thankfully our waitress said we could pass our spankings onto my dad!  Speaking of our waitress....she was GREAT. Super fun, friendly and a great employee.  As for the food, the burgers aren't bad, a little greasy for me, but hey....it's the Heart Attack Grill it's not supposed to be lean. The fries w/chili were good but got soggy kind of quick.  I would visit here again especially with someone who's never been before. It's an experience."}
