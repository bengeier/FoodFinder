{"text":"The Shipwreck Burger is the second best burger I've had in the United States, without question.  Believe the hype.  I came to this location because the Market Square shop was undergoing major renovations and was closed for several weeks.  I'm glad I did; I absolutely love the neighborhood, which Winghart's blends right in to.  The seedy interior was complementary to the food, which came from the kitchen perfectly cooked- medium rare, of course!  I stopped by during lunch, and while the place was disconcertingly empty, the waitstaff was pleasant and attentive, and took the time to chat with myself and my coworker.  They have a pretty well-stocked bar, and next time I'm in the area I'll make sure to take advantage of it."}
{"text":"My husband and I are from DC and came to Pittsburgh to visit family. We stopped by Wingharts for lunch and I could not have been more impressed. The staff is extremely friendly and you can tell they LOVE what they are doing. My husband and I both ordered the 'Shipwreck Burger' and fries. The fries are delicious! The burger was huge and the best I've had!! There were lots of burgers to choose from- it was hard to pick just one. Needless to say we are excited to vist Pgh again so we can stop by Winghart's for another burger!"}
{"text":"Good location, good waitstaff, good mixture on foods. Scotch list was outstanding. I've only seen one like this somewhere in Ashville, NC. Although the shipwrecked burger just didn't come out to my taste (wasn't bad, just wasn't for me), the aioli truffle wings were outstanding. Good place to pregame before a pirates game."}
{"text":"Burgers were pretty good. I had the Nad-alie and my husband had the Tallulah Hula. We shared the Cajun fries which were just okay. I had the Peach is in Fashion Manhattan which was okay as well. Our server was very attentive and nice. Sitting outside (upstairs) was really nice!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and attentive service. Burger was phenomenal. I would absolutely recommend this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here before a show and now I wish I could find a place like this back home in Seattle. We recieved a friendly greeting from the staff upon entering and it just got better from there. Prompt service from Shipwreck (please ask him how he got that nickname for a great story) and some excellent recommendations. My wife and I ordered the Boomer (come on...any entree that lists bacon as the first ingredient is a winner) and some drinks and we were very pleased. Overall, we had a great time. This will definitely be a place we will visit whener we are in town."}
{"text":"The food tastes great. I had a burger. Expected a side but there was none. It was too busy to add something or even get the waiter to notice us. I stopped at the Greek place across the square immediately after eating here because it just wasn't enough food.   1 star for existing 1 star for good food 0 star for service 0 star for portion size 0 star for price"}
{"text":"Great food great people. Food has been getting better and better. Glad I have a new spot I can hide out in monroeville with out going broke drinking there."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited Winghart's in June and were absolutely amazed by our burgers. SO delicious! Unfortunately, the water here tasted disgusting. I guess I should've ordered whiskey, but this was our last stop of the night (early morning!) and a refreshing water would've done me well. Regardless, the food more than made up for it and we can't wait to return this weekend on another trip to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Best burgers. Anywhere. Period. I'd been given that review by others and couldn't believe it wasn't hyperbole. Then I had a Shipwreck one evening, and I couldn't stop thinking about it until lunchtime the next day, when I went back for another one at 11AM. Such wonderful combination of flavors in the toppings, which is no mean feat--but the burger itself is the centerpiece. The most tender, juiciest, fullest-flavored, coarse-ground, perfectly crusted-and-tender within patty you've ever tasted.  Outstanding pizza too--the Punjabi Pie is as un-traditional as it gets, but simply delicious.   Super-cool staff (including the cooks) and a great crowd. Local art on the walls and good music. Limited seating."}
{"text":"The service was good. However atmosphere and food were less than mediocre. I ordered a fish sandwich, Beer fries and a tossed salad. To drink I ordered a captain and Coke Fish sandwich was ordered with American cheese onion and tomato and cocktail sauce on the side. They had no cocktail sauce they had no Frank's red hot the onions and tomatoes were chopped which fell off the bun and the fish was greasy. Who doesn't at least have cocktail sauce for their fish?? The size of the fish was very small considering They charge $11 for it, French fries were not bad but pretty greasy felt like a lead balloon after I was done. The salad was five dollars for something that should've been about 350. The Coke in the captain was flat had to take it back. If this place wants to succeed in Monroeville Mall they need to step up the food quality and overall atmosphere of this place"}
{"text":"Food is great. However they made my burger wrong. Then the waiter told me the manager was busy. I got the check and the burger was still on there the waiter said the manager was busy and that he would most likely have to pay for my burger. I told him I would talk to the manager he said don't bother. I gave money for the total check and told him once he removes the burger he would have a 25% tip. Then we walked out. So if you want to eat at Wingharts go downtown this one sucks."}
{"text":"The place was a little dingy and cramped and the only reason for my 2 stars instead of 1 star is the workers there were very nice.    My co-worker and I went here for lunch. It took 30 minutes to get 2 burgers, that's it, just 2 burgers, 30 minutes!! I ordered mine medium-well and she ordered hers medium. They were both well done. They were very small for the price and came with nothing as a side, no fries, no potato chips, no pickle, no coleslaw. If you are charging $13.38 (after tax) for a burger and no side with it, A. it better be big, B. it should come with something as a side, C. It should never take 30 minutes - they were not overly busy either. D. it should be good, this was just ok, nothing special!! I would never waste my time or my money there again and I can bet neither will any of my co-workers!"}
{"text":"We loved this place.  I had the shipwreck burger and my wife had the margherita pizza.  Both were great.  Seriously one of the best burgers I have ever had.    The staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Simply great! The bf and I stopped in before the Detroit/Penguin game on the recommendation of a friend and from my research on Yelp! I am thrilled with our choice. We split a simple bacon cheeseburger and fries. Let me tell ya, it was the best I've ever had! My mother is a burger fanatic so I've had plenty from all over. I can't wait to take her here! The place itself is small, but that's the only thing that is! This place is ridiculously chock full of personality. From amazing food, to staff who really know their drinks, to Shipwreck, it's definitely worth checking out. Everything is made fresh and there is NO microwave anything! Simple menu of burgers and pizza that taste anything but simple. The staff can recommend a whiskey or beer or anything that is sure to please any palate!"}
{"text":"Had the Market Square Burger, fries and 2 Sly Fox Royal, Weiss Beers. Total $23.01 plus tip.  Moses, the waiter, was quick and engaging. Order was quick and served on about 7 minutes.  Burger was OK, but undercooked per my me dwell request. Fries were fine. Same for beer.  Sat on balcony looking over Pittsburg's Market Square. Was a fine later summer day, on a Monday at 4:30. Was about 10 people inside.  OK, let's be honest, the place could use a little TLC and is something of a hole-in-the-wall, fit snugly between a Subway and Starbucks.     I think the value is OK, but don't know if I would come back."}
{"text":"Non-descript hidden burger and whisky joint in downtown Pittsburgh.  Like the feel and energy of the place - little gritty but homey and welcoming.  Friendly and knowledgeable waitstaff, great food and drink selection.  Had the margherita pizza and the shipwrecked burger.  Burger is beyond - definitely for that person with exquisite taste - brie, arugula, need I say more?  There are also lots of other selections of burgers to choose from based on your feeling.  I'm only in Pitt once so figured I go for the gold standard - and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"The burgers are very juicy, I had the Hawaiian and really sweet. The beer cheese and bacon funnel cake is really tasty and worth trying. Get it with one of the unique beers they have on tap."}
{"text":"Great burger. Tried The Nat-alie. You can really taste the fresh ingredients. Next time I've got to get one of their pizzas."}
{"text":"My friends and I go to Winghart's quite often and I've always been satisfied with our service until a few nights ago. We wanted Burgers and Fries which are delicious, until we noticed the red headed girl with glasses cooking the food was not wearing gloves. We literally watched her rub her nose put a burger on the grill and made people's plates, never washed her hands and never put on gloves which are right in front of her. It's a wonder no one ever got sick because of this unsanitary habit. I thought gloves were in necessity when you touch people's food. Always watch what cooks are doing with your food if you can.  We will not go back if she is cooking and we didn't order any food."}
{"text":"Stopped at the Carson St location tonight and were once again reminded why we never go.  Grabbed 3 seats at the bar and we weren't greeted in a timely manner. They had 3 people working the entire restaurant and had to ask 3 times for lemon water and draft lists. We ordered chicken dip as an appetizer then waited 30 minutes to order entrees. When the entrees arrived, I asked if the kitchen wasn't making chicken dip today. The bartender apologized for her mistake of not entering the dip and said she'd comp our drinks. I had to wait approx. 5 min before my salad dressing showed up. The food is good but the service is so awful that we will not return. Our bill was a little expensive so I asked for an itemized version and saw that she had not comped our drinks.  I also never got the lemon for my water."}
{"text":"Hands down in the top 5 burgers I have ever eaten. This is a very small place with a large selection of whiskeys and some fun drinks properly made by the bartender. They put the love into their food and drink so don't let the dive bar feel scare you away if you haven't been here before. I forget the name of the burger I had but if was topped with a pierogi and aus jus. YUM! Everything tastes fresh and made in house. The bartender took pride in her craft as well. Looking forward to visiting again for a tasty burger and high end cocktail."}
{"text":"P-CAF?!??!??  New owners, new management. AWESOME FOOD. I had the tikka masala chicken sandwich and it was incredible. Also for the table we got fries covered in truffle aioli and gravy(not on the menu, but it should be soon) and they were fantastic. Definitely ask for both of them together. We got a few pitchers of Blue Moon for the table and they were about what you would expect for college town prices.   This place is really underrated and should be a staple in Oakland for years to come."}
{"text":"Well customers next to us just sent everything back! Can't wait to get our order. Slow service. Only thing I like so far is the 24oz. Pabst Blue Ribbon! Good thing it's 24oz because no one has been back. Well, 35 minutes later had to ask them to bag it because we only had an hour for lunch. Not because they were busy, 8-10 customers with 4 cooks, 2 barkeeps and 1 waitress. Burger not worth $$ and the fries were burnt, yuck! Wouldn't suggest this place and will not be going back."}
{"text":"We went to winghart in market square today. We had the Shipwreck and white truffle fries. Kelly was our waitress. She suggested our meal and she was spot on! The food was absolutely fabulous!!! And Kelly was fun and gave us a great recommendation for our meal. The 2 burgers and 1 fry order was enough to for us to have left overs for dinner.  If you are in the Pittsburgh area make sure you make time for a terrific burger and fries meal"}
{"text":"Four stars for four simple reasons: R-A-R-E.  I ordered it rare and they cooked it rare. Pretty simple formula that tells you about all you need to know."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers, fast friendly and attentive service. Decent beer selection. The hard libations look tantalizing. Only a four star, the natural cut fries were very tasty, however the over cooked the pre cook, rendering them about and inch long or less. Minor details. Would recommend"}
{"text":"If you want an amazing burger this is for sure the place!! Great environment and service was excellent. Our waitress Becca was sweet and friendly. Shipwreck Burger and Nad-alie burger are the best."}
{"text":"Went yesterday with my wife and a couple of friends. Probably the worst dining experience of my life. Completely unorganized and terrible service.  They were out of lettuce and tomatoes, at a burger joint.... They failed to tell us this until the delivered our food. The burgers themselves were ok. The fries looked like they were the end of the batch and cold.  While we were waiting or our food, a truck pulled up to deliver food. A man was carrying a container of raw burger meat, and liquid was dripping out of it as he walked past and into the restaurant. Disgusting.  I could go on, but you get the point. Pretty disappointing since I've heard good things about their other locations. I blame management."}
{"text":"Seriously the best burgers ever. They melt in your mouth. AMAZING! The manager Derrick is super nice and always on top of things. Servers are great and upbeat. They have such a variety of quality food, made fresh and delicious. I love the fact that their burgers are hormone free! Lauren was my server, she was so nice and so friendly-always asking if I needed something and moving dirty dishes out the way. The host Tia was very nice and told me a lot about the food. She was smiling the whole time which made me feel welcome. In conclusion, I will be returning, just to be in the atmosphere and see everyone who works there. Amazing food, amazing service!"}
{"text":"Love this place. No refrigerators or microwaves. Fresh meat every day. I got the shipwreck burger and it was out of this world our waitress named Kelly rocked and was way cool and a really good server. Also had some rad sleeves."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered the Shipwrecked Burger and the Boomer pizza based on reviewers' recommendations. We were both disappointed with our choices. There was nothing wrong with the quality of food, just the taste of these specific dishes. We both agreed there was an overwhelming bitter taste. I'm sure if we had ordered something else off the menu we would have been happy with our food."}
{"text":"Friendly service and pleasant atmosphere, considering its located in the mall.  Food taste was okay, but portions were disappointing.  Just a burger, not that big.  Don't like it when I order a full meal but leave hungry."}
{"text":"Phenomenal, great staff and amazing food. Menu is worth closely reading for some funny jokes. Atmosphere is rustic and homey -music choice is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is terrible!  The food is not even comparable to the original location, the place just kinda feels like they succeeded with south side and became cocky. Over priced and simply bad food.  I ordered what I always get in south side, which is the \"Denny bleu burger\" (I think that's it's name), med rare and paid the upcharge of $2 for bacon.  It came out dry as hell and quite possibly well done. The \"bacon\" that was a $2 up charge was bacon bits and the smallest amount you could ever imagine.  I asked the waiter if there was bacon on it and he argued with me that there was and there was a lot. I have no problem paying $2 for bacon, but come on now, put it on it.  Next thing that happened was the obnoxiously dressed manager arguing with me about the bacon.  Later I received more bacon bits and the manager was so proud to tell me he took 15% off my bill, which totaled $1.80. Just laughable.  The decor is hideous, it looks like an old family restaurant like the ground round with \"cool\"/\"edgy\" art all over. Makes no sense.  Wingharts, get your shit together."}
{"text":"Probably my biggest issue with this place is that it sports a fancy name, but it's a really a dive bar.  That being said, it has everything that you look for in a dive bar: inexpensive, tasty, greasy food (french fries...on a salad!) and a great, inexpensive beer selection.  If I find myself in the unfortunate situation of being in Monroeville again, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been to the Monroeville location a few times and continue to be disappointed.  My biggest complaint is that there is no drink menu.  How can you call yourself a \"whiskey bar\" and not have any whiskey cocktails.  Also, the atmosphere is a little drab and the restaurant is usually pretty empty.  I will go to the Greensburg location from now on.  They showcase an awesome cocktail menu and a more hip atmosphere."}
{"text":"Alright Pittsburghers, I am a Tessaro's junkie and I won't stop going there but I just had a burger here that crushed a Tessaro's burger, very, very good. I had the Harper, she had the Mattolo (sp) and fries. It's early on a Friday evening, the service is just fine in a casual atmosphere, all we have interacted with are super pleasant. We will be back! !  Came back a few weeks later, brought a couple friends with us, outstanding burgers all four of us totally satisfied with our sandwiches."}
{"text":"Tried to go here once and will never go back.  Went out to dinner with my dad on a weekday night while he was in town.  He was in the mood for a hamburger and I had heard from friends that this was the place to go.  Being new to South Side, I took their advice.  When we walked in, there were about 5 people at the bar (again it was a Tuesday night).  The bartender behind the bar looked up, made eye contact, then turned and walked to the other end of the bar (towards the back of the restaurant).  Waited another minute or two - didn't know if we should seat ourselves or wait to be seated, as there was no sign nor direction given by staff.  After another minute or two, this bartender/waitress yelled from behind the bar that we could sit wherever we would like.  So we chose a table for two not too far from the bar and proceeded to wait - no menus, no drinks, etc.  The whole time we sat, I could see the staff who were working and what they were doing and made eye contact more than once with them.  The bartenders/waitresses stood behind the bar and chatted with the customers sitting at the bar.  There were two girls behind the bar, both doing nothing but standing around and talking to one another and to the other patrons and another girl who was sitting at a table in the back doing some sort of paperwork.  15 minutes later, no one had come over to even give us a menu, so we walked out.  I will never even consider trying this place again after such a horrible experience."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch throughout the week several times and even for dinner. It's always busy, but they move quick and serve up amazing burgers and pizza. The staff is always on their game, although they might be a bit stressed and rushed with the lunch crowd, and I've always had a good experience sitting at the bar watching the cooks put together ridiculous burgers.   They have a great menu, a good selection of beers, and an amazing selection of whiskey. I've yet to eat upstairs, but the renovations to the downstairs area really look great."}
{"text":"Awesome is the first word that comes to mind after eating here. Got the pierogi burger and truffle aioli fries, and both were incredible. Knowledgeable and friendly bartenders. I work in the industry, so far too often I find myself listening to the staff trying to bullshit their way through stuff they dont know about, but both the male and female bartender knew their stuff. I went on a Monday night and the place was almost empty. I'll be back again real soon."}
{"text":"I just went to this place for the first time, after always walking by. I thought it was a bit small, but not too bad. Very nice staff, and interesting menu.   I wouldn't get the wings again, though. They were kind of small and not that great, but the burger was boyfriend got was delicious, and the appetizer we ordered was as well. I also liked their beer selection, though they are known for their whiskey selection.   Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"They didn't have any pork even though it was clearly a menu item. Our group had a 1 year old but somehow they didn't think to give us a child menu until we asked.  The carpets, tables, and chairs are older and in slight disrepair.  The chicken burger was decent but smaller than expected and offered no fries or other side without an extra cost.   I recommend going elsewhere for good food."}
{"text":"This place just doesn't get it. I want to like this place because, as a Pitt student, it would be awesome to have another fun bar with a different atmosphere to go to.   This place has the potential to be a good bar for me and my friends. It has a dance floor upstairs, late night food (which I haven't tried yet), a ton of beers, and a patio which no other Oakland bar has.   Unfortunaly, all of these thing and more are done poorly. This place is \"out of the way\" for most Pitt students so they need some sort of late night draw which they don't have so the dance floor is empty. One night they even said they had a \"private event\" upstairs and there was a $7 cover.... yeah right. When the bar gets somewhat busy the bartends don't know how to handle it. Service is slow, getting checks are impossible, I would really hate to see it if the place were packed. Also, drinks are pricey compared to G-door and hems.   I just don't think this chain wants to adapt to the college scene. They run the place like a bar for a little older (25-40) crowd but put a dance floor upstairs and blast party music. Its too bad"}
{"text":"Best burgers downtown definitely worth the cost. I will continue to order lunch from there . waitresses was friendly."}
{"text":"In sum, best burgers in town. I can proudly state this as fact and not an opinion.   The service was excellent. The atmosphere was very unpretentious and has a laid back feel to it. I loved it. I never dabbled with bourbon before. The helpful bartenders did not lead me astray! I tried a few different types- the angel's envy Kentucky straight bourbon was my favorite. Just remember to sip if it is your first time, like me. I did sip it that night but ended up purchasing it weeks later. I regret drinking it so fast- 'nuff said.  The food. What can I say? The burger is juicy, rich, and perfectly cooked (MOO!).I ordered the shipwrecked- my fellow yelpers did not steer me wrong. The shipwreck has Brie cheese, crispy bacon, caramelized onions, arugula, and white truffle aioli. Oh and the hand-cut fries were finger-lickingly delicious. Crispy and tasty. Yum!   Get to this place NOW. Eat their delicious food. Your belly will thank you!"}
{"text":"I was at this local new years even received a very chilly reception like I was a part of Americas most wanted I guess all black men look like criminals"}
{"text":"Last year, I stuffed myself at BRGR.  (\"You gotta try Winghart's!\" I was told.) Last spring, I then scarfed down at Burgatory.  (\"But you gotta try Winghart's!\" I was told again.) Last month, I chomped some chow at Tessaro's. (\"Hey, dumb-dumb, what about Winghart's?\")  Hmm...where should I go now to try the best burger in Pittsburgh?  Uhm... I think I've heard this place called Winghart's might be worth a shot.  And no, there are no wings!  Our group had the Shipwrecked (Brie cheese, caramelized onions, bacon, arugula, white truffle aioli), the Mattola (applewood smoked bacon and American cheese), and the Market Sq (Bacon, mushrooms, and gruyere cheese) burgers.  It was a food frenzy. There was a lot of smacking, snorting, snuffing, and slurping.  Don't judge me, unless you've had these burgers.  Or the crunchy fries.  For those that have toddlers, it's definitely not kid-friendly.  There are some high chairs, but most of the tables are bar tables and stools, that are even taller than the high chairs!  But my kid is a trooper, and she enjoyed picking the leftovers off my leg. #goodparenting   So...BRGR, Tessaro's, Burgatory, Winghart's... who has the best burger?  That Shipwrecked burger was just this smooth, greasy, cheesy, burger explosion in the mouth.  That's tough to beat."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Winghart's today and had the Shipwrecked Burger. After trying the Pub Burger at Meat and Potatoes last night, I wanted to compare the two. First, let me say that Pittsburgh must be burger central because both burgers are absolutely excellent. For meat, I'd give a slight edge to Winghart's. M&P definitely has better buns. Overall taste I'd give a very slight edge to the Pub Burger at M&P. However, the fries are better at Winghart's so the overall meal is a tossup. Basically, you can't go wrong either way. If you're looking for a slightly more laid-back environment, go with Winghart's. It's small, but the people are friendly and the food rocks."}
{"text":"Great food, disappointing experience.  I'm gluten intolerant so picked this place based on it coming up on a gluten free list of restaurants.  The menu listed a gluten free bun for $1.75.  When I tried to order it I was told they didn't have any, because where they get them from they'd have to charge $5 for the bun.  Oh well.  The burger tasted great, just not as satisfying."}
{"text":"Yep-it's as good as everyone says. Perfect for lunch, especially upstairs on the balcony, Weather cooperating"}
{"text":"My first time to Pittsburgh and decided to give this place a try because it was close to my hotel.  What a find!!!   I had the shipwreck burger and it melts in your mouth.  The staff is super cool and inviting.  Beer is cold too!"}
{"text":"It took a business trip to Pittsburgh find the best burger I've ever had in my life. The patty almost melted in my mouth - so delicious. Really wish my flight home had been delayed!"}
{"text":"I never write reviews cause I hate the computer and can't type.  However, I feel compelled to do so because my wife and I love this place.   You can trust the quality and cleanliness of the beef, so make sure you don't get your burger cooked more than medium.  The burgers are exceptional and served on Mediterra bread (buns) which is one of the best bakeries in da' Burgh.  Also this place (Mkt Square only) has authentic brick oven.  Need I say more.  The biggest problem we normally have is which to order- burgers or pizza.  Do yourselves a favor...Get Both!"}
{"text":"We went to Wingharts for a friends birthday. First impression, typical bar scene and I was expecting typical bar food. I was horribly wrong. Their burgers are amazing! Kind of like Burgatory in the fact you build your own burger from scratch but not as expensive- SCORE! Also, try the Mac and cheese. We got a plate for an appetizer and it was delicious as well.  Our overall experience was good, I wouldn't mind returning. Recommend."}
{"text":"wow, move over tessaro's. awesome burgers, great people, stellar music."}
{"text":"Very cool underground atmosphere. Staff are incredibly cool and laid back while still very  attentive. Food was delicious. It's one of those spots that only the locals know about that initially appears uninviting, but once you make it inside, it's like you're one of the gang, and don't want to leave. Another cool place to hang in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Best burgers hands down!.  Went there last Saturday and was greeted immediately by the wait staff.  I ordered the Shipwreck Burger and my friend ordered the Market Square Burger.  We shared them and agreed they were both delicious!!!  I am looking forward to going back for a wood fired pizza.  The menu offers craft style burgers, pizza and salads with specialty toppings.  This place deserves nothing less than 5 stars IMO.  When the get their liquor license it will be all the better."}
{"text":"Winghart's vs. Tessaro's: FIGHT!  When I heard that this new Winghart's place had better burgers than Tessaro's, it required an immediate visit. I tried the shipwreck burger (bacon, brie, carmelized onions, arrugula, truffle oil) and the Market Square burger (bacon, gruyere, mushrooms), as well as some fries. Here are my findings:  Meat: Slight edge for Tessaro's. Both use very high quality meat ground in house, and both do a good job of cooking to your specification. Tessaro's meat is just a little bit better, though, and the char from their wood grill at adds a lot of flavor. Also, the Winghart's patty is rather greasy, whereas Tessaro's is not at all.  Bun: Tessaro's buns are adequate, but Winghart's' buns are definitely better. They have some egg in them and sort of resemble challah or brioche. Quite tasty.  Toppings: Winghart's is more inventive (see arrugula, brie, truffle oil above), whereas Tessaro's is more traditionalist. Both use high quality ingredients, so I suppose this just depends on personal preference. Push.  Sides: Tessaro's does not have a deep fryer, so no french fries. Their sides are good, but potato salad and cole slaw are obviously no match for even decent fries. Winghart's' fries are fresh cut and fried hard, just the way I like them. They're WAY too salty, however - and this is coming from someone who likes salty fries. These were so incredibly salty that I needed to drink multiple glasses of water just to get them down. Due to this flaw, I'd rather have Tessaro's sides, but if Winghart's would just reduce the salt by half they would probably take this category.  Price: Tessaro's burgers are slightly larger, and they come with sides; for the same amount of money at Winghart's you get a smaller burger and no sides. Also, I noticed aioli on the Winghart's menu and asked for some with my fries and they charged me $2 for a little cup of it! $2! Tessaro's definitely wins on price.  Verdict: Based on burgers alone, Tessaro's is still the best, with Kaya and Winghart's not far behind.  Overall, I'd also say Tessaro's is better, but this could change if Winghart's takes the simple measure of putting less salt on their fries. Winghart's is a new place and still seems to be working out the kinks, while some say that Tessaro's is past its prime, so this comparison will be worth revisiting in six months or a year. We may yet have a new champion."}
{"text":"Get the Shipwreck!  Best burger I've ever had, hands down!  Loved it!!!!!  I'll be back!  Super nice people and great service!"}
{"text":"Since I have moved to Pittsburgh I have searched for a great pizza place. I found it at Winghart's.  The pizza head fresh ingredients and was fire grilled right in front of our eyes.  The beer selection was good.  My friend got the burger and it was HUGE.  The fries homemade. The space is small but adequate and their soundtrack made for a great dining experience.  I would definately go here again."}
{"text":"Shipwrecked burger was to die for!! Server was super knowledgeable.. Friend had mattola burger and she thought it was delish as well....we will be back..awesome.."}
{"text":"Great little place for a burger and beer! Had the Hula Burger and it was fantastic"}
{"text":"Says open on Sunday's. Not on May 31. Primanti Bros. it is I guess. Lock on the door."}
{"text":"Nothing better than a good chicken Wang and winghart proved to meet my standards. I read another yelp review about the balsamic and garlic wangs and oh my goodness was I in wing heaven. The crispy wings were dizzled with a tasty balsamic and garlic sauce. My new favorite go to place for wangs. The place looked like a cave, dark and deep. I would probably prefer to eat outside."}
{"text":"RUDE from the moment you walk in.  Not server's fault but GM was not hospitable or accommodating at all."}
{"text":"Quite a restaurant ran by a local! This location offers more than his other two locations. One in Market Square and The other in the South Side. The Matolla burger is Fantastic. There are a few other things on the menu I'd really like to try but can't get over this burger."}
{"text":"Ate there last week, and I'm not sure what happens to some restaurants when they choose to locate in the South Side, but it definitely happened here. \"Service with an attitude\" was a huge part of that problem. If you are having an issue, please don't make the customers the brunt of your bad day. I'm not even going to comment on the food and drink, because if your service stinks, even just once, I won't come back."}
{"text":"Kind of a dive, but good burgers and whiskey. Not a huge menu, but that's not the style here. Recommend the chicken burger and some whiskey on the rocks.  Small place, so get here early for lunch."}
{"text":"Burger meat was delicious. It was served medium rare as requested but the toppings were very cold which resulted in a cold burger. The cheese had not melted and the sautéed mushrooms were also cold. Unusual way to server. I didn't want a McDLT."}
{"text":"Stop in here when Connor is tending bar. He reminds me of some of my favorite bartenders back home - attentive, makes you feel welcome, and pours a mean drink. Pretty refreshing to see a bartender creating new cocktails instead of sitting on a stool texting his bros. I didn't eat but I did watch a dude go to town on some pizza and not only did it look delicious but he looked mighty satisfied. I'll be stopping by next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"In Pittsburgh, we're having a mini Burger Revival. With restaurants like Burgatory at the front of everyone's mouths when asked about the best burger in town (which I have been to and greatly enjoyed), I was taken aback when the Shipwrecked Burger at Winghart's literally gave me pause. You know that moment when you realize you have just bitten into something REALLY good? That was it.  The meat was cooked perfectly. Only seasoned enough to recognize that it was seasoned at all, the soft meat become smooth like a seared beef tartar. The bun was buttery and actually had body to it. All of the toppings (arugula, white truffle aioli, applewood smoked bacon [admittedly, EVERYONE has applewood smoked bacon], Brie and caramelized onions) went perfectly together. And the hand cut friends with the mystery salt! I asked one of the girls there about it, and she said the owners won't tell them what kind of salt it is. I've never used salt as a talking point about French fries, but it makes a huge difference.  I have been back several times since that epic first dining experience, and can also speak well for the Tallulah Hula Burger and the I Don't Care, Whatever Burger.  Overall, I love to pseudo-punk rock atmosphere of the place. They have a great beer selection every time I go. Great whiskey/bourbon/scotch selection. The food is pretty reasonably priced, on top of that.  Wingharts can give Burgatory a run for their money.  GO TO WINGHARTS!"}
{"text":"I visited for my First time Friday with my Godchild. The host was engaging, friendly, professional and serviced in the short absence of our attending server. The servers were pleasant, knew the menu and were most accommodating. I enjoyed the meal and service so much, I brought other family members the next day. Good job,  I was impressed."}
{"text":"I had the \"Shipwreck\" burger.   This is one of the best burgers I have ever eaten.  My wife is an exceptional cook whose favorite food is hamburgers.   Though I may pay for it later, this is better than hers.  The combination of the brie, caramelized onions and white truffle aioli with the quality beef is wonderful.  The staff is awesome and fun.   They have a nice selection of beer and great music.    Check out the mural in the bathroom."}
{"text":"Very good burgers and friendly attentive service. My husband said the shipwreck burger was very good. Hula burger was also delicious. The white truffle fries were flavorful and maybe an acquired taste."}
{"text":"Menu sounded great burgers just cooked wrong. Manager had a bad attitude."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  The shipwreck burger with arugula and Brie was delicious!  Dude ranch fries were perfect!"}
{"text":"Really awesome burger! I had the Shipwrecked and the fries with mojo seasoning. The server was really nice and attentive too. We had our 11-month-old son with us, and they told us he was more than welcome. They even told us we could rearrange the chairs and tables to fit our stroller. My only complaint was that it was too warm in the restaurant. It was a very warm day and I don't think they had the air conditioner running."}
{"text":"Love Wingharts!  Definitely try the Shipwreck Burger! It's won a ton of awards for best burger in PBurgh and the bartenders are so cool.  The atmosphere is chill and they have whiskey specials almost every night!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Typically when I order wings, I gave to request extra crispy and extra wet, but not here. It was automatic! Being a California girl, this is and was HUGE! The only complaint is the server was a little rude when he asked my party of 3 to move from a table of 5 when we were told to go upstairs and seat ourselves. If there was an off limited seating area, the employees should've told us or they should've seated us. Other than that, we'd definitely eat there again & again. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"The Shipwrecked Burger is one of the best burgers I've ever had. If you go there get this. It is amazing. I wanted to eat another one after I finished the first. The burgers do not come with a side. So I ordered the fries. They weren't very impressive. I ate them because they were there. Pretty salty, and weirdly sweet.   The Southside location a much better experience than the one in Market Square. When we went to the Market Square location we were given warm draft beer, and then ignored. The bartender never bothered to see if we would like to order food. Ignored us when we tried to ask for the check multiple times. She was too busy chatting up her coworkers. Awful. We ended up leaving and eating somewhere else.   The four stars is for the Southside location. Staff was friendly, it wasn't to crowded. 30 beers on tap. I definitely recommend trying their burgers."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service and great high quality burgers but the real gem is the whiskey bar up stairs!"}
{"text":"Burgers (shipwreck! ) and pizzas are great (the boomer probably my favorite pizza in the city). Good Draft selection and great whiskey selection.  Cocktails could selection could be better.  Only downside of this location is lack of seating. Great staff. Will often see owner chatting with customers about whiskeys and scotches."}
{"text":"Good lunch service on a Sunday with 2$ Yuengling bottles.  The Shipwreck burger was amazing, with very well-flavored beef.  The toppings went together very well.  I would have never thought of putting brie on a hamburger.  This burger was so good that if I were local to the area I'd probably have gone back the next day to have another one.  The first time I ate it too fast and then it was gone.  The pepperoni roll appetizer was interesting but we would not recommend it as a meal.   Our only complaint was the fries-- they just seemed overcooked to us.  That one thing aside, it was a great meal."}
{"text":"Seeing 1 star ratings here and wondering if these people could have possibly gone to the same place I did called Winghart's.  is there another one in the South Side I don't know about?  Maybe without the apostrophe?  I realize we can have a bad experience even at a good place, but really?  1 star?  I'm scratching my head.    Winghart's may be the best burger joint Pittsburgh has to offer.  The burger itself is on par with Benjamin's in the North Side, arguably better.  The bartender was cool and unassuming.  Their fine selection of bourbons, scotch, canadian and irish whiskies, and craft beers is a bonus.  Oh, and the fries were pretty awesome too.  This place has raised the bar and set the standard for the growing burger trend.  Now i just need to check out the one in Market Sq and decide which is the best Winghart's."}
{"text":"Can u say Dogmeat? Went to Wingharts monroeville and it was a truly awful experience. Ho hum wings, burnt fries and, most egregious, a burger that I wouldn't even feed to my dog. I can grill up a tastier, juicier burger in my backyard for just a coupla bucks.  Prices are way too high for the quality of food (or lack thereof) and reputation is overrated. If you want a gourmet burger, go to Cheesecake Factory and get the Americana burger. You will be better satisfied with money better spent. Will not be returning to wingharts."}
{"text":"Great burger but service could improve.  Had the shipwrecked and it was awesome.  Waitresses will disappear at points and there's not really that much room to sit.  Still it won't stop me from regularly going there.  Burger was cooked to order and delicious.  Wouldn't mind having a few cheaper beers though as PBR is the only beer that doesn't cost ~6$.  Atmosphere is pretty cool too, dark with a cozy bar."}
{"text":"I'm a fan.  Good place to hang out at Lunch time in Market Square.  I like the ability to hide here and get a nice drink.  Almost everything on the menu is solid.  Excellent beer list, I recommend getting a bottle.  Try a pickleback!"}
{"text":"We spent a weekend sampling Pittsburgh food and Winghart's was the highlight by far. Burger and fries were awesome, the upper patio is a great atmosphere and the staff were helpful and down to earth. Eat here!"}
{"text":"Burgers are the BEST.  Light years better that any other I've ever had.  Recommend \"Shipwreck\" and \"I Don't Care, Whatever\""}
{"text":"I wish I'd never eaten at Wingharts, because every other burger, every single pizza, every last french fry, I have eaten since is colored with the frozen taste of disappointment, the thawed-out sense of mediocrity, and an overwhelming feeling of despair.  The food at Wingharts utterly blows my mind. I fear that one day I will let no one cook for me save the Wingharts staff and my own grandmother.   The Shipwrecked burger almost made me cry."}
{"text":"I work downtown and this place is awesome!  I've ordered both salads and burgers - both fantastic.  They do all of their own fresh grinding and seasoning of meat and it's delicious.  The seating area is really tight and cramped but they just opened an upstairs too.  The lunch time crowd is crazy busy, but overall excellent!  If you work downtown, definitely try it out (order take out)."}
{"text":"Fries: the truffle aioli tasted like bland mayo. Burgers: mediocre at best with old buns.  Drinks: the J&T was gross. Service: was okay, but not very vigilant."}
{"text":"My Shipwreck burger was awesome.  Cooked medium as requested.  Good beers on tap.  This was a slower night since there wasn't a Penguin game and it was after Happy Hour...parking is difficult though.  Got to talk with the staff and owner.  Awesome people.  What makes this place great isn't just the food and nice selection of booze you can't always get in PA state stores (totally recommend the Old Port Rum) ......its the people that run it.  They are comfortable there, they are all friends, they make that place into a joint they would want to go to.  They aren't catering to a certain crowd just to make a profit.  They do it for the love of the restaurant and really make it their own."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place.  Can't get enough of the pizza prasad even if its a burger place.  Any burger on the menu is a good choice with the obvious house made beef they are frying up.  This place is delicious.  Love the people, atmosphere, food, and beverage.  Great."}
{"text":"Great food in Pittsburgh's Market Square! Had dinner with my kids here before a show at Heinz Hall. Easy walking distance of Pittsburgh's theatre district and the PPG Place ice rink. Reasonable prices and possibly the best pierogies I've ever had in Pittsburgh, where pierogies are a tradition. Get the \"grandpa style\" with bacon and fried onions - you won't be disappointed (and they are made fresh in-house daily). My daughter ordered the grandma's mac and cheese. Despite a warning on the menu that it would take extra time, we were served within 20 minutes. They don't use microwaves or freezers in the restaurant - everything is freshly made. The crust on their pizzas is amazing, and my son loved his \"hula burger\" with pineapple and other toppings. If you eat upstairs, try to snag a table with a view of Market Square - or eat outside on the balcony if the weather allows."}
{"text":"Went here for the veggie burger, so my review criteria is probably a little different (since I can see that people love the meat burgers here, and I'm sure they're right on). All the toppings on the veggie burger were delicious and worked well together, but my burger was SALTY. I don't know why every place that makes a veggie burger thinks that the way to make it flavorful is to pack it full of salt. Props for having it on the menu and including some very fresh and delicious toppings, but I just can't get over how the salt overpowered any other flavor in my meal."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum! These burgers are the bomb.   My man and I went here to grab lunch one weekend, after hearing rave reviews, and Winghart's totally lived up to the hype! I had the Shipwreck Burger, medium-rare, and he had a cheeseburger with ketchup and pickles, well-done, because he's a baby.   Anywho, my burger was awesome -- they toast the buns on the griddle, which i love, plus it was oozing with Brie, caramelized onions, truffle oil, bacon, and I don't even recall what else. I just know it was fantastic. The buns are large enough to hold the fairly large patties, but they're nice and light, so you don't feel like you're eating more bread than meat and toppings.   However, I must admit that when our food came, I didn't touch my burger for a few mins, because I was gobbling up the fries! Their fresh cut fries are phenomenal!!! I couldn't get enough. There's malt vinegar sitting on the counters, too, so I splashed some on. Love, love, love fries with vinegar.  I also must note their awesome on-tap beer selection (I had a hard pear cider), and whiskey selection, of course. They had a bottle of double black Johnnie Walker, which we'd never seen before, and our waitress (Crushin' D) was so kind as to bring the bottle over for us to check out, she told us a bit about it, and she poured a li'l sample for my BF to taste. She was also just friendly and all-around knowledgable, which I always appreciate.  The space itself is pretty small, tight, and dark, but it totally works. It's the right ambiance for them! They do accept credit cards, and I saw a dude come in to pick up grub, so they do take-out too, which is good to know!   All in all, Winghart's deserves top marks, and I'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Best burger in the 'Burgh - hands down!  I've gone through just about the entire burger and chicken menu's, as well as about half of the pizza menu - I have yet to be disappointed. I can't even pick a favorite menu item from any of those sections.   The Shipwreck and Market Square Burgers are equally fabulous, but this is not to short-change the Idon'tcarewhatever(??) Burger in the slightest.   As far as chicken, Colin's Orangutan and the Chicken Tikka are both awesome.   Pizzas? Chicken Tatonka and the Pineapple./BBQ sauce based one again, also excellent.   Go, you must."}
{"text":"I've visited the Original Winghart's location in Market Square numerous times and consider Winghart's to being the finest burgers in the 'Burgh, with Burgatory being a close second,   After my first visit to Monroeville location - I'm guessing they've ironed out some of the issues that spawned negative reviews soon after opening, as my experience was everything I expected to be.   Beautiful day, so I ate outside. Had Colin's Orangutan and the Shipwreck Burger. Burger came out cooked medium-rare as requested. Both lettuce wrapped for me.   Service from both the hostess and my server Krishna(sp?) was attentive, genuine, and actually possessed some personality. That being said, I'm not high-maintenance like most seem to be when eating out. Bring my food, keep my glass full, and perhaps smile occasionally.  As far the people complaining about kid's menus etc....  Um...it's called Winghart's Burger and WHISKEY bar - does this sound like a place FOR kids?   Newsflash to people with kids - the world does not need to conform to your every beck and call. Some people actually want to go somewhere and enjoy a meal without your screaming, unsupervised, and whiny spawn running around causing mayhem.   What does being located at a mall have to do with families and/or kids anyway?  Is Victoria Secret for kids? Spencers? R-rated movies at the theater?   If you want a kid's menu, go to Applebees.    Reminds me of the people asking for Vegan/Veg. options at MEAT & Potatoes...  Ok. Rant over.   Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Awesome Mac and cheese great dinning experience. The Edison bulbs and atmosphere were just awesome in my opinion. Staff was very helpful and pleasant. Excellent choice. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I like this place. My friend and I came here for dinner and some drinks on a cold friday night. They have an interesting but small beer selection. I was able to find a couple beers that were quite good though. I am not much of a liquor guy but I tried a sip of the whiskey my friend got and it was quite tasty.  I got the Hula burger. It was decent. The fries were also pretty good.I felt pretty cramped eating at the bar though and the platter they served the burger and fries on wasn't really big enough for the food given. It also was pretty freezing inside, especially when the door opened.  The bartender was very friendly and enthusiastic. All of the staff were very nice and personally say hello to you as you walk in from behind the bar. One problem I had with the service was that my burger came about 10 minutes before my friend's pizza. I know we were sitting at the bar, but it would be nice to get our food at the same time. The music selection and atmosphere inside were both great.  Overall I would definitely come back for a casual meal and drink. Perhaps when the weather is better. Im not sure if they have outside seating but that would be a plus."}
{"text":"We ate at lots of high end places while in the Burgh. This hole in the wall beats them all. It is SPECTACULAR American food! That's it jus yummy comfort food. O and our server Cornel was a HOTTIE"}
{"text":"Went in there this evening for dinner and was pleasantly surprised. Samantha waited on us and it was truly one of the best service experiences I've ever had. She was so sweet and helpful. We had wings, the buffalo chicken pizza, and the shipwreck'd burger. Food was great, nice draft menu, and again amazing service. Also, I really enjoyed the music. Nice array of pop and punk music. Will be going back again. Please check it out!"}
{"text":"Here is why I am rating this only two stars when I love the food:   We got there earlier than usual on a Friday night (around 7), and there were no seats at the bar, which is where we've been lucky enough to sit in the past.  So we are seated in the way back by the bathroom  Would be okay, except that I can SMELL that urinal cake smell from the bathroom.  I get that they need to seat people back there, but they have to keep it CLEAN.  I am smelling bathroom odors and my husband is smelling garbage odors from the trash can right next to us that is OVERFLOWING with garbage.  Seriously?  There is garbage on the floor right next to where we are seated.  Between these two things, we considered leaving, but we thought the people next to us were going to be leaving soon, and we figured we could grab their seats.  I got a whiskey, and it was seriously a much, much smaller pour than I've gotten in the past.  I didn't love our waitress.  She mixed up my order with my husband's.  (I ordered my burger medium rare and got it medium well, and his medium well burger was served to him medium rare.)  She came to check on us, but obviously didn't care what the answer was, because my  husband's answer of, \"Good, except....\" was cut off promptly as she walked away.  I love sitting at the bar, and I love their burgers, but to sit in the back with the servers was painful!  Oh, and leaves of lettuce had fallen out of the refrigerator that is right there in the table area, and I watched the servers walk past them about ten times without sweeping anything up.  It was just one of our worst restaurant experiences in a while, and it was really disappointing and icky."}
{"text":"I got an excellent burger and drinks here on a Friday night and it was excellent! That was one of the tastiest burgers I've had.  I got the market square burger and my friend got the blue burger and we both loved it.  The drinks were good, the service was nice, good location, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The burgers were terrible. The \"beef ground every morning\" is obviously a lie. The buns and burgers seemed like they were bought bulk and frozen. For being rated one of the best burgers in Pittsburgh it was a shame. All staff were on their phones the entire time. It was just all around terrible. Would not recommend at all!"}
{"text":"Great divey place on Market Square that stands out from the chains (Starbucks, DDs) and the    higher-end places (Poros) - the pierogies are highly recommended with just the right amount of pan-fried goodness and the white truffle fries our waitress recommended were top notch (make sure to share; portions were big).  Service was above average - our waitress Rebecca (?) offered some great suggestions on menu items, inquired about our first-time visit to PB, and was generally good company.  Wish I had more time to go back and try their burgers - next time."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my experience here.  I went with a table of four.  We ordered a few drinks, 2 pizzas, 2 entrees, and 2 salads.  We went on a Saturday night, and while the restaurant was busy, it was hardly filled to capacity, though the waitress told us many, many times that she is very busy, and that the kitchen is busy and is struggling.  I've never been given that excuse by a waitress so many times.  She was attentive for the most part and kept our drinks coming, though it took about an hour for our food to get to our table.    My main problem:  One of the salads was wrong, so I asked the waitress to change the salad and she said she didn't want to ask the kitchen to fix it because they are busy.  I requested that she at least try to get me the salad that I ordered, but she came back a few minutes later with the same wrong salad and told me that the kitchen refused to fix it.  I was a little shocked--I don't think I've ever been told that a kitchen refuses to make an item that I ordered, especially when the waitress admitted that she had entered the order incorrectly.  I took the wrong salad because she said she would take it off my bill.  I wish I would have tried the wings; the Hawaiian pizza and the side salad were both mediocre, though my husband had a good burger. Mixed feelings overall, but it was hard to get past that poor service experience and I doubt I will eat here again."}
{"text":"Normally I really enjoy coming to wingharts for a beer and burger. This visit just completely put me over the edge.  Walked into the place with a guy up front telling me to sit where ever, which seems pretty normal.  After 10-12 mins of sitting there expecting the guy to come take my order, he never came.  A nice waitresses took notice and told the guy I need to be waited on, but 5 mins later ... the guys is still no show.   17-18 mins of sitting at the bar, no one even took my drink order or even gave me a menu.  Can't be that hard to figure out one of the three parties at the bar have not been served   And yes I knew the exact time, because I didn't have anything to do besides fiddling around on my phone the entire time.   Step up your game Wingharts!!!  It will be a Very VERY long time till I go back again and only because of the good beer selection and good food.  Should you find yourself there, and potentially a different  person at the front, I am sure you will have a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Pizza oven down. Wasn't impressed with their sandwiches. Maybe try again when oven is fixed. Til then I would avoid."}
{"text":"Wingharts was the one place we found that had room for five on Saturday night. We sat upstairs by the bar and the staff up there was very friendly. We started with the grandpa style pierogies and shared a bunch of burgers. The pierogies were AMAZING!! So delicious. The burgers had great toppings but were extremely undercooked. We all asked for medium and our burgers were mushy, red, and cold in the middle. Really just the outside was brown.   Everything was so good though that I would suggest going and just asking for a longer cooking time than you usually would."}
{"text":"Overpriced, everything comes a la carte and it's just a burger joint, stupid.   Burgers are nothing special and WAY overpriced.   Menu prices are not what we were actually billed.   All this time we waited to come here while it was under construction and it was a huge disappointment.   Won't ever come back."}
{"text":"Cool little bar in the corner of Market Square.  Great bourbon list, outstanding burgers, and delicious chicken wings.  Great service from Sam the bartender and we went back the next night for a night-cap."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with the burger I ate at Winghart's. I ordered the \"Shipwrecked\" burger and the combination of brie, caramelized onions, aioli and arugula was a perfect foil for a fresh, high-quality patty of medium-rare ground beef. The patty was cooked perfectly to temp, and the bun was substantial enough to stand up well to the burger and toppings.  Our server was friendly and attentive, and I liked the decor and ambience of the bar, sort of a rocker vibe."}
{"text":"Definitely the best burger I've had!  Stopped here for a quick lunch during work and was blown away by the burgers. I chose to have the bleu cheese burger which was amazing! The hamburger bun, dressing, and quality of beef were all delicious. While this place doesn't have much seating, it's always easy to grab your burger and head out to Market Square to enjoy."}
{"text":"As I've stated many times, Pittsburgh is a GREAT food town. You can get easily spoiled because most every bar does some food exceptionally well. If you get lucky, you sometimes happen upon a bar that does everything exceptionally well. One such bar is Wingharts On the Southside. The food is soooooo fresh, Pierogis made daily along with the beef for the burgers that is ground every morning. They also make their specialty mac and cheese to order, no precooked  soggy nonsense. This makes a difference! In addition to the standard bar fare, the surprise you with funnel cake covered with bacon and beer cheese sauce. We had the pierogis, funnel cake, mac and cheese, pizza, and a spicy burger, all were AMAZING! What got the fifth star from me was the service. Bartender Rae and chef Drew were excellent. They were attentive and when asked for menu suggestions, they were spot on. They help elevate Wingharts above the hundred other bars on Carson Street. I would highly recommend this little gem!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Even though we went there about an hour before closing. Wings are amazing love the crispiness and flavor each bites bring. The burgers are melt in your mouth heavenly delicious flavored filled bites! Will definitely come back to this place when I'm back in this amazing city!"}
{"text":"Google may  lead you to 4th and market STREET. It's actual on Market SQUARE. It's inside the block. Cool area with a bunch of fun eateries and bars.  Great food and service. Cool view from the terrace."}
{"text":"These are the best burgers in pittsburgh, and with a great beer selection, it's a weekly staple in my diet."}
{"text":"This place is terribly run. I had issues with an order and it took a little over twenty minutes for a manager to even approach the table. Which is ironic because we watched the manager who approached us sitting at a table talking for a good half hour. The fries were cold and so was the atmosphere. I have been to the market square location and I expected the same standards for the 'new' and larger location but I will definitely be returning again. As a matter of fact, I won't be returning to any of the locations. I work in the city and always send people to wing harts for a good burger but maybe now I'll recommend the further commute to BRGR in east liberty. My server  Hayley was great. Her hair was as bright as her personality. The servers are probably the only thing keeping this place open and for their sake, I hope they move into better opportunities quickly."}
{"text":"I'd give this place a 3.5 if I could.   Food: Hit and Miss. Thought the Bacon Cheeseburger I got was delicious, but I wasn't a fan of having to pay extra to have lettuce and tomato on it. The Ranch Fries were delicious as well.  For the hype surrounding the pierogies I thought they could have been a tad better. While solid, they were doused in sour cream and it times it took away from the pierogi.  Service: I thought the service was spotty even though the crew seemed like there were enough bodies to be able to handle the Friday Night 3/4 full crowd from about 8-930pm. We sat at the bar and felt like at times we were being ignored when I tried to place a drink order.  Would I go back? Likely, because I didn't get to try the pizza. But I'll be honest, I'm not sure if the $60 charge (including tip) is exactly worth it."}
{"text":"This place has great wings and burgers. They also have some of the best fries I have ever tasted. On the whiskey side they have a solid selection. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Loved it!  It was definitely up there with the best burgers I have had, ever! Not just in Pittsburgh. I like the simplicity of this place. Simple burgers, simple bar, everything from seating to ordering.   I had the Denny Double blue burger cooked medium. The meat tasted really super fresh and the burger was cooked to perfection. nice and juicy and not compacted. The meat was super tender compared to some other burgers where the meat may be cooked correctly but the patty was packed together too hard. The buns also tasted really fresh.   The special lady had a veggie burger, what a bore. Just kidding I tried some and would even consider getting those in the future. I said to her, this almost tastes like falaffel (not sure if I spelled it correctly and spell check didn't figure it out). And apparently that is what some of the ingredients are.   They have wine, they have whiskey, they have beer. All the components that I need to come back on a regular basis it wasn't overly expensive either. I would hate to forget to mention the waitress that we had, we didn't sit at the bar because it was full. She was very attentive and polite and we didn't wait long at all for our order to be filled.  Go check it out for yourself sometime."}
{"text":"Reasonable bourbon selection, questionable scotch selection/variety, well-crafted burgers.  Received cold fries.  Limited but informal seating.  Didn't try the pizza.  Great for a burger and a bourbon.  Reasonable but unoriginal draft selection."}
{"text":"LOVED this place!! It's cozy and quaint.  Our server was adorable and on top of things. I do not remember her name but she had ear muffs on. Was in town for a girls weekend and this was our first stop of the night. Had the French 69 drink...delicious!! I made my own pizza for dinner. Hands down the best pizza I've ever had. Cannot wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Could not recommend this place more! The food was outstanding and the staff was very friendly! We had the loaded baked potato fries, shipwreck burger, and blue cheese Mac and cheese. Could not be happier!!!"}
{"text":"The burger was cooked exactly as I asked for it - medium rare. Great fresh meat. Ordered the pineapple burger (can't remember the official name). Was a very cool sauce on it so highly recommend if you want a different take on the Hawaiian burger  Downside was that it didn't come with fries or a side and the bartender didn't ask or say anything about it - guess I am just used to it.   As far as the beers - great selection and good knowledge base. Claim to be whiskey bar but have about 20-30; not awesome selection but solid.   Strange neighborhood but well worth a visit if you are in town."}
{"text":"A MUST IF YOU ARE VISITING. Burger was amazing. Wings were great! If you have to wait for a seat, worth it!"}
{"text":"Very solid place. As a burger and bourbon fan this place hit the spot. I've been to both locations and I personally prefer the downtown location but again, it's just a personal opinion on an opinion based website.  The Southside location feels more like a bar and the downtown location is more of a burger/pizza joint.  Burgers are great. I recommend getting it cooked medium rare.  You can either create your own or order one of their handful of craft burgers.  Along with the many whiskeys they offer they have just as many draft beers available."}
{"text":"I'm here for work and randomly picked a restaurant to eat at. Good service; I got the Mac n cheese with blue cheese. It's super yummy! Very good experience and I would come back again! The pizzas looked great too"}
{"text":"I work for the bakery that makes the burger buns. I have to say the Hawaiian Burger was the most amazing burger I have ever have. The meat just melted in my mouth and I had a wonderful Sly Fox Beer on tap with it! Wonderful experience and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"For a place that doesn't brag about their wings they do them great. Had the blackened blue & whiskey BBQ tonight and both were great. This place is a must try!!! Plan to head back this week and try out one of the burgers."}
{"text":"Holy moly!! My burger was amazing!! I built my own burger with all of my favorite ingredients on a potato bun and it was truly a remarkable piece of artwork. Unfortunately, we were not greeted with the nicest of smiles. Great food can easily be overshadowed by underwhelming customer service. Customers pay for the whole experience, not just a meal."}
{"text":"Stopped in before a concert, about a 15 minute walk from the Consol Arena. What am awesome surprise! A very tiny place. Everything was made from scratch. Try the homemade chicken sausage appetizer dip. Wood fired pizza was fantastic. Every pizza and burger has a twist plus fresh mozz and Brie! Definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"Chicken dip was great....wings tasted very odd like their funnel cakes. The hostess was AMAZING! Our server was fair, and left us hanging at the end. Never addressed our concern about the odd tasting wings."}
{"text":"You want a burger and you're downtown? This is the place. Hands down, the place. Just do it. It's a bit unassuming, and maybe it looks a little dive-ish. Disregard, enter, and order a burger.  You may leave smelling of burger for the balance of the day, but that's OK because it will be a great way to remember the best burger you'll eat in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I went with my boyfriend and another couple last night. I had honestly never heard of it, but the other couple was responsible for choosing the restuarant this time. We started the night off with a beer - I had the one that was \"similar to a Blue Moon\" (very good, and lighter than a Blue Moon!), my boyfriend went for the seasonal Cider Ale. It literally tasted like apple juice, fabulous.  I don't know what came over the four of us, but we were bottomless pits last night. We sarted off with two pizzas, the margharita and the chicken sausage. Both were great - the crust was perfect in my eyes.  Then we all ordered the Shipwrecked Burger. Holy Cow. So. Good. If you like your burgers juicey and flavorful, you will love this. Brie, carmelized onions, aruglua?  I grew up eating medium rare meats, but I went with medium (everyone else went well-done). I guess they prepare the meat there so it's safer to eat more-rare, next time I plan to go medium-rare.   The waitress said the fries were good, so we got two orders. And yes, they were very very good. Ketchup not needed.  The manager came over and spoke with us. I love when this happens. She was very friendly and told us a little about the secret behind the fries. I don't care about secrets - I just want more!  I can't wait to go again, and am very excited for the Southside location to open up - I hear there is an expanded menu!"}
{"text":"The downstairs was not open for some reason but it would it would be wheelchair accessible as would the downstairs outdoor seating area.  The service was spot on-our server (Kelly?) immediately delivered menus, offered recommendations when solicited and took our drink orders.  While the menu offers specialty burgers, one can also compose a burger to one's exact taste.  My husband and I couldn't have been pleased when our food order promptly arrived.  The burgers were cooked to our specification, toppings were fresh and the patties were of generous size and soooo juicy.  Our server checked in with us regularly but inconspicuously so as to not be overbearing.  Others around us were eating items other than burgers and clearly enjoying their food.  I highly recommend Winghart if you're not inclined to hit Burgatory-in fact we recommend Winghart over that place for many reasons including:  great table service, specialty cocktails, extensive beer list and menu items that offer something for everyone."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! I don't know from where to start.  The margarita was delicious and the whiskey as well.  You should try the spinach dip, my mouth is watering just for thinking about their pita bread!  The burger is extremely fresh and delicious and the fries is so crispy and fresh that I could say is my favorite in the entire world.  And to finish our night we had funnel cake, so crispy that my husband said is the best he ever had.  I totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"After a Pitt victory during Family Weekend, we took our daughter's roommate and her parents out for a casual, fun dinner.  Everyone wanted red meat...so we pooled our collective foodie knowledge and chose to give Winghart's a try.  Everyone settled in over their mixed drinks.  They have a really cool bar set-up (upstairs...see the picture attached) and I had a most unusual beer with flavors of banana and caramel.  My family loves wings and we'd heard their are pretty rock star, so we ordered a traditional Buffalo style plate.  The traditional \"mighty\" Buffalo wings (as they call 'em) were absolutely delicious with a crispy skin and hot / moist inside with a perfect heat to the sauce.  Add a nice cooldown with the bleu cheese dressing on the side and we are nearing perfection.  On to the burgers!  The Market Square burger was cooked a perfect medium-rare and served with gruyere cheese, sautéed mushrooms, bacon and a honey mustard dressing...was a bit too sweet for my tastes but a good burger nonetheless.  The Denny Double Blue cheese burger had two different kinds of cheese...a creamy bleu cheese (dressing) and dry crumbled bleu...it was my favorite of the two burgers we sampled.  My daughters each ordered a plate of pierogies.  The Lucy's original pierogis were slightly crisp on the outside and filled with delicious, creamy potatoes and served with chive sour cream.    Lastly, the dude ranch fries were heavily seasoned (which I did not mind, but my wife frowned upon) and served with a side of ranch dressing for dipping.  The fries were cooked perfectly, and who doesn't order fries with a burger, huh?!?!?  A great meal, funky atmosphere and an attentive bunch of servers led to a very enjoyable family evening."}
{"text":"We have been to Brgr and Burgatory. They both have far superior burgers. We even prefer Red Robin to this place. We went at lunchtime when two other tables had customers (one had two, the other had four). We waited ten minutes to place our orders, 15 minutes to receive a simple appetizer and another 15 minutes for our burgers. Everything we ate was EXTREMELY salty. The burgers were too well done for all of us, even though we all ordered them at different stages of doneness. The four of us will not return."}
{"text":"No complaints about this place. We've been to their South Side location once and decided to check out the Market Square iteration. We came on a Tuesday night before a show downtown, so it wasn't crowded at all. We grabbed a table upstairs and had a great server/bartender. They didn't have any cider (womp womp) but he recommended a pineapple beer for me and it was excellent! We shared the loaded baked potato fries, and I had the Market Square Burger. All was delicious! We're always happy to support local businesses with our appetites :)"}
{"text":"Veggie burger is amazing. Great burger, fries, funnel cake. Everything is fresh. Great service. I wish I had eaten every meal here while in town."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a great experience... friendly bartender, great bourbon barrel beer, and some of the best burgers we have ever had. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken pizza and it was bland and burnt to a crisp. This is the 2nd time I ate there and both times the quality was more \"greasy bar food\". They try to hype up the quality but anyone with taste buds can tell you the quality of ingredients is extremely low.  Worst part was it took over an hour (I was on a lunch break) which made me late for a meeting."}
{"text":"Medium rare burger was closer to medium well, bun dry;  Server was nice; bartender amazing.  I had heard a lot about the burgers here and I have to say was disappointed in both burger and fries."}
{"text":"Great stop for beer and a burger!!!  The Oragatang is a fantastic chicken sausage burger that I highly recommend.  It's fun to watch them patty and form the burgers right in front of you.  The rest of the burger menu is solid with some interesting innovations in toppings.  The beers are a well curated list of great brews.  OH! And don't forget the fries!  Life altering!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to get here for months, and finally last weekend I did!  My hubby and I went around 3 on a Saturday. Even at that time it was crowded. I knew it was a small place, but it was REALLY small. Most of the seats are at the bar, so going with a larger group could be difficult.   The servers were friendly are helpful, but the bartender took quite a while to pour our beers.   On to the food... hubby ordered the Shipwreck and I got the Hula. We ordered both medium rare. They came out overcooked, but the meat was so good that we didn't notice that much. These aren't tightly packed, pre-mad patties, these are huge, juicy mounds of yumminess!. We also got an order of fries, which were handcut and delicious.   Random things I noted: -Only salt shakers, but no pepper?? I like pepper on my fries! -Great music playing while I was there -Good selection of interesting beers on tap  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and staff.  It has become my normal Thursday lunch spot when in the city.  I walk in and the entire staff knows me and knows my order..lol"}
{"text":"This place is packed, no wrong with that but nobody addressed us when we walked in. No system or waiting list. So we are just waiting awkwardly here. Bad experience for a sophisticated eater."}
{"text":"In town for a convention and other Yelpers rated this place pretty well.  Very select beers on tap and we didn't realize there was a full bar upstairs. We sat at the bar in front of the kitchen and had some great interaction w the staff.  Split wings and the Salad a la Pitts with the wife. Wings are great! Big size, nice crust on them, and good flavor overall. The salad had some chicken sausage on it that was insane! Great flavor with a hint of garlic in it.   Small hiccups from the waitress, but they were packed so it's not a big deal and at the end of the day who really gives a S..."}
{"text":"Veggie burger is really unique and one of the best I've had. Really cozy and chill little restaurant that I will be sure to come back to. Went on a Sunday night and it wasn't crowded upstairs. Cocktail menu looked amazing. Nice waiter and great service. Loved the whole vibe of the place."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers!!!  You will not be disappointed!! We all had a different burger and all were so good!! Will be back."}
{"text":"I have never sent food back in my life, but my Shipwrecked burger I asked for medium came raw. I sent it back and the bartender told me \"Don't you know beef are the cleanest animal.\"   I know raw ground beef is not safe to eat even though I like my steaks on the raw side. She then said, \"I guess you're one of those people that knows everything.\"   I'm a judge advocate in the Marine Corps out with my buddy trying to remember the holiday for the right reasons, and we had to put up with this. The burger came back after a half asked re-firing on the same lettuce and bun. It was still raw.   The beer selection - I had two - was nice, but I left immediately after. With competent service this place would at least be acceptable, but this experience nearly ruined my Memorial Day evening."}
{"text":"We had a burger and a pizza.  The pizza was Rachel's Trip To Greece.  Spinach and artichoke spread, feta and veg.  The chef Cale to explain the art festival had brought so many customers they ran out of red peppers and olives.  I told him to wing it with anything.  The result was awesome.    One issue - heavy metal music was a bit loud."}
{"text":"2 stars for the wings - 1 star for the bland buffalo sauce, and +1 for the nice jumbo-sized wings.   I made sure they made their own buffalo sauce instead of just use Frank's or something. They did make their own. And uh... it wasn't great. Smelled really strongly of vinegar when it came out, but unfortunately it was SO mild.  No tang, no spice, and lacking in plain old salt.  I'll be nice and +1 star for the ephemere cherry I had. I'm not a big beer person, but my friend said i might like it, and it was probably my favorite beer I've tried ever. Straight up fruity with a very refreshing finish. It's probably not for everyone, but it was for me.   Interesting selection of rareish beer(s) might make me come back. The decor and vibe is a bit generic, but it's fine. However, shitty wing sauce with my beer is a definitely big strike in my book :/"}
{"text":"Went for a later dinner. Arrived a bit before 9:00 pm on a Sunday night. Bar is whiskey-centric and there's not much for non-drinkers. No rootbeer, no iced tea, no bottled water. Pepsi cola drinks. Good sound system with a pay per song capability, so we loaded it up with some good music. We went for the burgers, which we heard were very good. Burgers were, indeed, very good. Bar was very empty on Sunday evening, so a good time to go if you're not really into the bar scene but on the hunt for a great juicy burger. Solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"I first discovered Winghart's in Market Square about six months ago. I almost instantly fell in love with the place (you can ask my jealous girlfriend). From the hand ground burgers with toppings as unique and quirky as the people serving you, a red blooded red meat eater like myself had little to complain about and much to love.  The new Carson Street location is every bit as good as the restaurant in M2 but in very different ways.  The food is spectacular as ever (so good I often question why they are even bothering to ask about the quality) and now you actually have room to eat! The new Winghart's seats approximately 50 at a mixture of industrial chic and hardwood tables and bar. This is a welcome departure from the original that seats about 20 if you squeeze in. The comfortable, relaxed and welcoming atmosphere has made the move as well. Staff are friendly and helpful with Grand Viceroy Shipwreck (actual title and name) still firmly at the helm. The cool punk/folk/altrock music came along for the ride too. I remember hearing everything from Dropkick Murphys to Johnny Cash.   The beer selection is also fantastic. While not quite as expansive as Fat Head's or Blue Dust in Homestead, Winghart's is now sporting about 30 taps as opposed to maybe 10 like Market Square. As always, the whiskey selection is well above par (it is a whiskey bar after all) and all the drinks are reasonably priced as well.   Now on to the main event: the food. Ask anyone who knows me and they will tell you I am not a tiny guy and I love my food. Burgers have always been at the top of my list of loves. A great burger is somhing that is so easy to so and just as easy to screw up. Winghart's has, hand to God, some of the best burgers I have ever had. Period. Owner Zach Winghart cut his teeth working for some of the best chef's in the country (including one of seven U.S. Masters) and brought his passion and skill to the most humble of American staples. The burgers themselves are perfectly seasoned, fresh ground and expertly cooked. I get mine medium rare and they have that perfect juiciness and firmness. Don't forget about the fries while you are there. All orders are done a la carte, but they are well worth it. Winghart's does their fries right: hand-cut and double fried. The double fry is key. It produces a spud that has a wonderfully crispy exterior that guards a creamy and delicious interior. Also, and I realize that this is somewhat of a revelation in Pittsburgh, Winghart's *gasp* SEASONS their fries! I have waited the better part of a year since moving here to find properly cooked and seasoned fries. Sorry Primanti Bros., I do love your sandwiches but your fries suck. For and added treat, order your fries somthered in the house made beer cheese. Your arteries will hate you but your soul will love you.  To sum up, Winghart's will always hold a special place in my heart. From the fun and friendly staff, to the cool, welcoming, and relaxed atmosphere to burgers and fries that are unrivaled in Pittsburgh, Winghart's is a place that must be experienced. The only negative I can find is that Winghart's closes at some point  in the early morning. Come for the burgers, stay for the people, and leave in a cab because of the whiskey."}
{"text":"These sandwiches are stacked high! And with fries inside of them, how can you go wrong? Pretty delicious. Great place to watch a basketball game with good beer, good food, and good friends :)"}
{"text":"I had grandmas Mac and it was delicious my friend had tika Mac and cheese and thought it was fantastic. Good food, good service!"}
{"text":"We looked on Yelp then checked the menu it all,got approved. We sat down, it was very hipster.  The menu choices looked good. We ordered porogies to start and I ordered the boomer pizza my buddy a basic pepperoni pizza and Jose a burger protein style. I ordered a ruby mule as well. Our drinks took a bit to arrive. Our food however took 45 minutes to come out. The waitress was super nice and conscious of the time. She sent the manager over to talk to us. They handled it very well. I felt bad for the server. Two tables of customers left.  The food was mediocre. The porogies were delicious"}
{"text":"Great food. Especially the wings and burgers. I've never had one bad thing here. I would caution the cleanliness of the market square one. The rest are great, but the one in market square isn't the most tidy. Avoid the bathroom if possible."}
{"text":"I need their Punjabi Mac recipe! Besides that, I love this spot and it baffles me that I don't hear more people talking about it. I eat here pretty regularly because I live and work around the corner and it is hands down the best restaurant in market square. I think it's incredibly underrated compared to the other spots in the immediate area. Handedly, in terms of food and drink quality and consistency I've had the best experiences here. Great spot for happy hour or even to bring the family for burgers."}
{"text":"There's now a virtual tie in my mind for the best burger in Pittsburgh.  This place is hands down the best place to go to satisfy that craving for a grease bomb of a burger.  I had the pineapple with onions and BBQ sauce.  Messy, delicious, just what I wanted.  I tried the brie and truffle aioli burger as well.  I wasn't a big fan of brie on a burger, but you could taste every component and the concept was pretty cool.  The fries were delicious.  Bigger than shoe strings, but definitely smaller than steak fries, they reminded me a little of Five Guy's fries.  The seating kind of sucks.  I would say this is more like a bar that serves awesome burgers (as opposed to a restaurant with a bar).  The decorations on the walls were cool and added to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"By 6:30pm yesterday, I realized I had only eaten a whopping 200 calories...in the form of raw veggies and black coffee. So I decided it would be OK to indulge in some Winghart's for my evening meal! I didn't want to go overboard, so just stuck to the Mumbai Pie. Being Indian, I was both intrigued and skeptical as to what this Indian-inspired pizza could be. It was incredible! A 10\" thin crust pizza on what looked and tasted like an atta flour (wheat) crust, the base was their take on a tikka masala sauce, topped with minced grilled chicken (like keema), a few fresh mozzarella slices and scallions. I ended up eating the entire thing in about 5 minutes, and don't regret one bit of it! It was delicious and I highly recommend the Mumbai Pie at Winghart's. I've also tried their garlic wings and perogies, which were also delightful.... but can't wait to try the Shipwreck burger and much talked about Boomer pizza, next!"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to topping several days spent on the Allegheny Passage with the special Winghart dining experience that we have so come to love! Sadly, we departed hastily before even sitting down in an attempt to preserve the halo of good karma from our bike trip.   Now, I understand the Sunday of Labor Day weekend might have been understaffed and that the on-duty staff  was overworked.... (not sure why large dinner crowds this weekend were unanticipated by management) But, allow me to describe what happened. Downstairs was not overcrowded, but we hoped to find seating upstairs cause we like the atmosphere. The bar was full, so we headed towards the door to the outside seating area. Here our path was blocked by a chef (on duty? off-duty ? But in full chef garb) with a look of concern on his face. \"You probably don't want to sit up here at all\" he said concernedly.  \"We only have one person on staff up here, and they are under!\" Now normally, such a warning would have been appreciated. But the next thing that happens is right beside me an unhinged bartender is maniacally imploring a friend at a table to \"Please shoot me in the face, Shoot me in the face!\" \" I can't handle it anymore!\"  Now that's a buzz kill, totally stressed me out. As we made our way downstairs a drunken patron sarcastically said \"why you leaving? Don't like the music?\" We are repeat customers and have always enjoyed the food here, but service is fully at least half of the equation and have seen the staff at times slacking in the service area.  This was one epic meltdown, but come on staff and management, Man Up! Until they fix this problem it's going to be hard to recommend winghart's without a precautionary tale."}
{"text":"Not a bad place. People were very friendly in there. I ordered a jack and coke for $5.75 and I got it in a little tiny sipping cup. I wasn't thrilled about that so I had to order double jack &cokes the rest of the night which was a little expensive. Overall wasn't bad"}
{"text":"I heard such great things about this place and could not wait to try it out.  A group of us ventured to Southside for Happy Hour last Friday.  That early in the night there was plenty of street parking and we were able to get a large table in the back of the bar.  They have $4 draft happy hour specials and a great list to choose from. I tired a beer I had never had before-a cherry ale that was delicious.  They also had $1.50 PBR pounders which my date went with-could not pass up the great deal! The one thing they do not have is wine-a member of our party tried to order wine and they only have one kind from a box. Well of course this is a whiskey bar so I would expect nothing less!  They have a really unique menu with funnel cake appetizers. We went with the regular one with powder sugar but they also had one you could try with cheese and bacon-not sure if I would like that. We also ordered a pizza that was delicious-it had pineapple and barbeque sauce.  The pita and buffalo chicken dip was another great appetizer I recommend.  The burgers were a bit pricey but heard they are the best in the burgh.  Our friends tried them out and they sure did look tasty!"}
{"text":"We came in on a wintery saturday afternoon and found wingharts to be moderately full on the lower level.  However, we were informed that there was an upstairs that was empty.  The upstairs is pretty cozy and has a nifty looking bar.  It is definitely a more intimate setting up there and was perfect for conversation.  I \" put (my) HART into it\" as the menu says and ordered a beef patty with cheddar , lettuce, tomato, and ketchup on a gluten free bun.  Overall, it was a pretty good burger, no contamination issues.  I'd go back for the atmosphere.  Menu is a bit limited for celiacs, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Excellent burger. Whole set up was a little intense though ... Recommend doing as take out for a more relaxed way to enjoy an amazing burger.  I felt like I inhaled a giant burger because I was sitting at the counter almost on top of the grill and was rushed to keep moving. There are only a few counter seats (6-7?) and a few high-top tables.  Also - potato salad was ok, but reco sticking with the fries.   Everyone was nice and fun...just limited space to have an intimate experience their burgers deserve."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers! Definitely one of the best I've ever had. Fantastic taste with ridiculous names! I love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Apparently, this Winghart's location recently went through some renovations. It's really nifty and cool inside. My father was marveling about how many different kinds of lightbulb swerve hanging from the ceiling. Our server was really friendly and attentive (partly because it was a slow Sunday early afternoon.) He was conversational and made sure we were well taken care of. We ordered the Shipwrecked Burger, the Market Square Burger, and the Tika Masala wings. Along with that we got the white truffle aoli fires and the mojo fries. Everything was ridiculously amazing. You can taste how fresh the beef is, since it is apparently ground fresh daily and never frozen. I do not live in PA, but if I were to return, I will certainly make an effort to stop in here again!"}
{"text":"The service was awesome, Bree our waitress was attentive and informative. The food was great, fresh, tasty, and nice sized portions. Gene the cook makes an amazing pizza. Everyone was friendly and made us feel at home. I highly recommend this place for food and drinks."}
{"text":"It's a hole in the wall but they have a decent whiskey selection... Service is very friendly ask for girl with blue hair didn't catch her name but she is very helpful!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent, however, the atmosphere is troubling.  The lighting is terrible and it feels like you're sitting inside of an old shoe box.  They need to maybe make it more open in terms of the topology and make the seating areas have appeal.  Also, if you're by the window and it's winter - prepare to eat with your jacket on."}
{"text":"Pretty much the coolest place I've been,  awesome burger, fries were fantastic and well deserved of the #1 rating plus the bar tender made one of the best martinis I've had and ordered an old fashioned which was even better for my second experience with and old fashion.  Check it out"}
{"text":"2nd visit!  Amazing food.  The Boomer Pizza is incredible and the burgers are perfect."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in at Winghart's on a whim to celebrate her birthday following a Steelers game. Our intention was to grab a quick bite - we ended up being there for several hours. The cocktails were to die for. I especially loved the smoked margarita (possibly the best margarita I have ever had) and she enjoyed the sage saz made with rye and absinthe. Colin, the bartender, was extremely helpful and made wonderful food and drink suggestions (he gets an A+). We had such a fun evening and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a place to eat and came across Winghart's.  We went to the upstairs area and sat at a table near the bar.  The place was slightly noisy and there's a jukebox but the music was at the perfect volume.  I ordered the Necessity with onions instead of jalapeños.  I'm a fan of spicy food about as much as Pirates fans enjoy seeing the Cardinals win.  The burger was tasty but I wasn't a fan of the BBQ/honey mustard combo.  The fries were well seasoned but a tad salty.  My wife got the funnel cake.  As natives of New Jersey, we are used to funnel cakes from the Jersey Shore (hold the Snooki).  The funnel cake was delicious.  The service was great and I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Really good service and great food. A savory funnel cake? H*ck yeah!!  My burger (the name escapes me but it had Boursin cheese) was perfectly rare and an ooey-gooey delight. I couldn't eat it all but didn't care. The fries with the truffle aioli - wanted to put them on my bed and roll around in them. Settled for putting the leftovers in a to-go box and into the hotel fridge. Next time we are in town, we will definitely pay them another visit and try some of the other gems. But the funnel cake is a must!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem in Market Square and for a while was my place to go out on weekends. The people who work here are incredible, each having an alter ego name that they give to patrons that come into the bar. It was definitely my type of people, very hip and alternative and laid back. The menu is actually good bar food, but a drawback is that I remember their kitchen closing pretty early (maybe 9 or so). The first few times I stopped in I had just missed the cutoff and had to drink my dinner. However, the drinks are very good, made strong, also a pretty good beer selection. The actual bar actually isn't spacious or particularly amazingly decorated, but they have since opened up the upstairs and it's great with more tables, another bar, and I believe even a patio overlooking Market Square. The reason to go here is the people who work there who all get along great with each other and just are there to have a good time. They now know me when I walk in (as my alter ego) and act really happy to see me (whether that's true or not). And that's what we all want when we go out, right? The food and decor of a place are obviously important, but having a good time and enjoying an experience is about the people you interact with- and that's why I have no qualms about giving them a 5-star rating."}
{"text":"What a place. Came in slightly before 10. Asked if I could order food. Server says yes. I sit down, bartender brings me a placemat and says \"hurry up and order\". I say I need a menu.  He says \"we are keeping the kitchen open for you, so hurry up\". Them he walks away. Still no menu. I'll never, ever come here again. Too many nice people in the world for me to tolerate jerks like this."}
{"text":"I had a delicious make your own burger. My husband had the veggie burger and said it was tasty but there was \"too much going on\" and it was messy. The basket of fried was huge and moor than enough for two of us. We'll be back, I'd definitely like to try the perogies."}
{"text":"I never had a chance to try Winghart's until now. I was happy to hear that they were coming to fill the former Houlihan's location. The family and I decided to give them a try this last Friday. The place was pretty dead other the bar. Once inside the hostess greeted us and seated us at a booth.  About ten minutes later our waitress came to take our drink orders. She brought our drinks and disappeared for another ten minutes. Once she return we all ordered. My wife had the Cordon Blanc Sandwich. (Chicken, ham, cheese, spinach and red onions.) Our daughter had the Pepperoni Rolls and I had the Market Square Burger (Bacon, mushrooms, and gruyere cheese covered in honey mustard dressing.) While we were waiting for our food the manager came around and asked everyone how their food was but, didn't ask us as we didn't have our food yet. Good thing our food was fine as he never came back around.   My burger was delicious . My wife and daughter enjoyed their food as well.  I also ordered the Mother Marys Poutin Fries for us all to share. They were just okay. The gravy on them had a weird taste. Almost like too much gravy master or something. I don't know.   My two biggest complaints are that there is no kids menu (You are located in a mall and families do go to the mall so add a kids menu damnit!) and the service could be better. They did just open so I will give them another try to get it right."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this place the rating I did was the fact the Tattonka Buffalo Chicken Sausage pizza was excellent!  The blue cheese was not over powering and it savored just the right amount of spicy tangy aftertaste.  This place lost points because of the price and poor customer service.  I didn't care that there was a very small seating area.  You go to NYC, sit in a cubby hole, pay $600 for a two person meal, and they give the place rave reviews.  The price isn't that bad, but its right at that border of \"being too much for the food\".  The poor customer service comes from the fact that I snapped a phone photo of the front open kitchen.  I was going to send it to friends and make dinner plans.  The skinny bearded cook came over and wanted know why I took the picture.  When I explained he tersely replied to the effect, \"someone asks permission first!\"  I really became uncomfortable after that.  Hello!  If that was an offense, what the hell are you doing in an open- counter kitchen, where all of the kitchen's actions are on display?  I have managed the business operations of five different restaurants.  I also, meet with PRA.  So trust me when I rhetorically ask, \"If this is the level of their customer service, I will be surprised if this one beats the odds!\" I won't be back."}
{"text":"Good Burgers and Pizza. Service was a little lackluster for a Wednesday night. Would definitely return next time in the Burgh."}
{"text":"We sat for twenty minutes while 6+ staff cleaned and stood around and made zero eye contact.  This was 4:00 pm on a Saturday.  Guess they don't like making money here..."}
{"text":"Had the make your own burger and homemade fries. The fries were fantastic. Anytime you can get homemade fries it's a definite plus. The burger was good also and I'll be back to try other items off the menu. A little pricey is the only drawdown and reason for four stars."}
{"text":"Shipwreck was top 3 burgers I've ever had in my life. The food and service was a testament to the quality of product and overall experience worthy of a 5 star review"}
{"text":"So we arrived Friday night in Pittsburgh from Richmond, VA.  After dropping our stuff off at the hotel we decided to venture out for a quick dinner.  Based on reviews, I chose this restaurant.  Super cool interior and I liked that they had two floors, both with outdoor patios out front.  It was located in the market square area which was pretty cool as well.  Service was attentive and friendly. So we got two orders of the fries (should have just gotten one to share because there was plenty in one).  We got the truffle one and the cajun one.  Both were great, but that truffle, omg, wow.  Yes, can I haz that errday!!!  So good!  Now to the burgers.  Meh, I really was hoping for something good here based on the reviews.  And maybe I'm spoiled coming from Richmond where we have alot of amazing food choices, and literally the best burger I have ever had with truffle mushrooms mixed in (Brux'l Cafe Truffle Burger is MY JAM!)  So, suffice to say, the burgers weren't that great, they were just okay.  Basically, not good enough to return for the burger, but for those fries I would!  What could they do to improve?  Honestly, the bread wasn't very good.  It wasn't fluffly and light.  It was stale.  Also, the meat on the burger just wasn't flavorful.  I get my burgers pretty much plain with some veggies on it because I WANT to taste the meat.  I am always looking for a good burger."}
{"text":"Really a 3.5 score. Food - 5 star, server - 1, cooks (i sat in front of the grill) - 4. Worst server i have had in a long time, but the pizza was great, so its a wash with a median score. If i could have a different server, i would be back for sure."}
{"text":"Heart attack on a plate, but oh so good!  This is a great place for a caloric splurge - dieters beware.  Though it is a burger joint, I am a huge fan of their chicken sausage pizza.  Call ahead, because everything is made to order.  Their burgers are also great, and I can't stop eating their fries. They have an ever-so-slightly salty & sweet thing going on.  The people working there are friendly and outgoing.  It's fun to sit along the wall and watch your food being made."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat downtown.  It is one of our favorites for a takeout lunch during the work day or a great place for a meal and a beer after a long day at the office.  The food is extremely fresh and well prepared.  Also, since they specialize in burgers and pizza, the food is always served quickly.  I love that the owner chooses to use fresh, local, natural ingredients and does not simply serve boring pizzas and burgers.  Everything on the menu is original and tastes great.  My only complaint is that the place is very small and gets crowded quickly, but that is only because the food is so good!"}
{"text":"Burgers, whisky and wings. How could it be bad? Super laid back environment exercising a hard to beat triad of features."}
{"text":"Was looking for some late night for after a Pirates game.  Not from around here, so we had no idea where to head for some grub... Find this place in yelp.  Really good food.  Got the beer cheese fries, tanonka dip and buffalo wings.  All really good! I love their buffalo sauce that's on the wings. So yummy!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Especially if you care about things like  paleo eating and all natural eating.  Beside regular potato buns, they have the choice of gluten-free buns or lettuce wraps on their burgers!   Also everything, down to the sauces are all made from scratch.   To tell you how fresh things are here, they do not have a freezer or microwave.   Besides all that, the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best burger I have had in pittsburgh, ever.  Everything is so fresh.  The fries are perfect.   My boyfriend got the Bleu cheese burger, he loved it. Whenever someone says they're going to burgatory I immediately steer them towards Wingharts.  It's better, it's the same price, and the company is divine.   Sure, it's a little small but they serve whiskey, burgers, and pizza.  It's perfect for the man in anyone's life and prefect for a the lady if she's not a \"dainty\" eater."}
{"text":"The food and service is GREAT and I'd recommend this place to anyone.  The only thing that stood out for me is that it seemed a little cramped if you're going to have a large group and could use more lighting, which I suppose lends itself to being a cool neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"I travel often for business and always look for the local place, not the chain restaurant names.  This place was a solid choice. The burgers are insanely huge and excellent.  I got a burger with blue cheese and the works.  Next time I'm in Pittsburgh (which is often given the shale business), I will be visiting Winghart's again."}
{"text":"Not my favorite. My coworkers and I came here for a birthday lunch and it being my boss's favorite burger place, I was really excited to try one of their burgers. I ordered the Market Square burger which was $12.50 and their burgers do not come with fries. That's pretty outrageous for a burger that only had cheese, mushrooms, bacon and honey mustard. A basket of fries (which is pretty large) is $4. So if you want a burger meal with fries to share, it'll cost you over $16. Yikes. I guess this is ok for dinner but a little steep for lunch. Another thing to mention, their honey mustard is more just mustard. I didn't quite get any honey from what I tasted. And yet another note to mention, the burger here made me really sick afterwards. Ugh. So for a burger in Market Square, you can probably find a similar, maybe better, burger at Diamond Market for a slightly lower price tag and it'll come with fresh cut fries."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh staple, every time we are here, awesome!    Market square burger, tikka masala chicken sandwich, side of fries and wings...   Woodford old fashioned, Medieval thymes (bourbon + Meade cocktail)  Go to Wingharts, duh?"}
{"text":"My dear friend Karl and I went here for dinner. We had the shipwreck burger and a great IPA. It was nothing short of amazing.   Karl who was staying on in Pittsburgh went back two or perhaps three more times that week. He also took more friends there.   If you want a tasty burger -- you will find it at Winghart's."}
{"text":"So I FINALLY got my butt over to Winghart's after hearing word of mouth that the place was absolutely a-mazing.    I have to say, first off, that I love the atmosphere.  I've heard some people knock it because it's just a bar atmosphere, but where else do you want to eat your burger?  I certainly don't want my meat with cloth napkins and Tchaikovsky in the background (and I adore Tchaikovsky).  Anyway, I really enjoyed the restaurant/bar atmosphere.  The staff was very inviting, conversational, and humorously sassy.  It was a little stuffy inside (get some of that outdoor seating yo!) but I sat near the door so I could be more comfortable.  I tend to do my research ahead of time when visiting a restaurant with much anticipation, so I already knew I was going to get The Shipwrecked Burger.  Hello white truffle aioli.  And hellllooooo bacon, cheese, and carmelized onions.  Now, unfortunately for me, the brie cheese on the burger was just too dominating a taste.  It has a very earthy flavor which overwhelmed the other toppings.  But I'm not the biggest brie fan, so that whomp whomp was on me.  However, I did feel that the burger was too greasy overall.  When my burger arrived I could already see grease saturated into both halves of my bun.  I'm all for decent fat content to enhance the quality of the beef, but at least for me, too much grease takes away from the flavor and causes everything to kind of mush together.  But I really am a fan of the creative combination for the burger, even though my palate couldn't appreciate the brie.  OOO, and also,  amazing fries!  Delicious fries with the skins still on.  I was so happy when I dug to the bottom of my burger basket and found the tiny little ends that fry up to an amazing crunch.    So I'm definitely going back!  Even though my first burger was a little off, there are still many more options to choose from!  Add in a fun atmosphere and yummy fries, and I'm pretty sure this place will soon become my favorite new Market Square spot."}
{"text":"It's always nice to meet people who take pride in their work. I came here for some whiskey after a Pirates game. The bartender (Chris, I believe) took great pride in his recommendations and service. There should be more places like this in New York. If I'm ever in Pittsburgh again, I would make an effort to get back here."}
{"text":"Very fun  and busy place.  The habano burger was delicious.  I missed the whiskey but they have a good beer menu.  It is located right in the center of a lot of street action and they have outdoor seating.   Everyone I was with also enjoyed their food.  We sat outside and it started to rain a little, but it didn;t even matter.  Wait staff were awsome, very friendly and quickly brought our orders.  Don't bother waiting in line at the \"famous\" Premanti Brothers across the street, go to Winharts for a much more enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers and fries I've ever eaten. Fresh ingredients, nothing frozen. No use if the microwave and the quality proves that."}
{"text":"Stopped here while re acquainting myself with Pittsburgh.  Cool place, good beer.  Nice atmosphere.  Pretty cool graffiti art adorns this hidden little gem. Bee didn't eat here but the food looked really really good.  Worth the stop.  Next time I'll eat."}
{"text":"We went here for the winghart heart attack Pizza. When the pizza came it was  small and had such little bacon on it you could barely taste it very disappointed. Maybe we should have went to the original in Market Square we definitely won't be back here"}
{"text":"Sometimes it's really difficult to find a moment to post a review.  This is one of those moments.  I should seriously be engaged in one hundred other productive endeavors. Still, I find it necessary to post a few words to my fellow yelper's.  This place has ahhmazing burgers.  Everyone in our party preferred mid-rare, which after reading other reviews, we made a point to emphasize. They were cooked to perfection.  The bun was good enough to eat on it's own and the service was so warm and helpful.  Because we read some wildly disparate reviews on the fries, we had to give them a try.  Not surprisingly, our party shared the same disparate reviews.  I believe it's all about what you're looking for.  The fries are well cooked and crispy.  Also, a hint of sweetness prevails, which we attribute to sharing the fryer with the awesome funnel cakes?  Alas, I could not deduct a star when so many in our party loved them.  Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers, and love the mac n cheese! Though prices did go up so it's been awhile."}
{"text":"Burgers were delicious and they literally had the cleanest glasses I have ever seen in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Deliciously casual and awesomely awkward spot. Draft beers are on point. Food is slow, all made in house and I appreciate it, not slow like it took too long. A spot for all to visit when the sun sets and you're too old to visit the south side location."}
{"text":"These guys are incredible!!  Great food (esp burgers) and personalities!!!!  Big time beer selection as well."}
{"text":"We sought out Winghart's on the recommendation of Linda W who was kind enough to let us know about it. It was quite a bit smaller than I expected, even with my expectation of it being a hole-in-the-wall kind of burger joint. No worries though, as we were the only ones in there late that Saturday afternoon.   The waitress was friendly and service was quick. She recommended the Shipwreck Burger and the Market Square Burger. We took her advice and added a basket of fries. I was a little disappointed that there weren't more choices for a place that is predominantly a burger place. There were 6 options, none of which were exactly what I was craving at the time. I would have appreciated an option to customize my own (like Burgatory). That's right, I said it.   Fries were served first and I thought they were excellent. They had a sweet, yet salty flavor to them and are definitely in my top 5 list of fries around the city.   The burgers were good - though I wouldn't say they're the best. Again, top 5 from what I've sampled. We ordered them both well-done, and they came out almost too well done. The toppings were good - very unique. I enjoyed the Shipwreck, however my wife wasn't thrilled with the sauce on the Market Square burger.   I would certainly be up for going again, although we rarely make it down to that area of town. A solid 4 stars in my book."}
{"text":"So after running around the city doing the Pittsburgh Challenge and being carb deprived, Wingharts seemed like a good choice for an early dinner!    We walked up to the small restaurant/bar and grabbed a table outside.  The menu consists of burgers, pizza and a couple salads.  Although standard offerings each one has a unique twist.  We started off with some fries and I ordered the veggie burger.  The fries were delish (how many bad fries have you really had though) but the burger was lacking.  The patty was dry and condiments didn't bring much to the table.  For my first taste of carbs in a while, I was underwhelmed.   My friend got the cheese pizza which kinda looked like a cafeteria pizza. She said it wasn't anything to write home about.   Pros: Love new restaurants in market square, outside sitting, full bar, good fries  Cons: A bit underwhelming taste wise.  Fries don't come with your burger so you end up spending about $11 for a veggie burger which seems steep to me.   Overall:  I will definitely sit outside and people watch in station square but I am not rushing back."}
{"text":"Burgers were awesome, as well ass the fries. The staff was great, greeted and seated me and my date in a timely fashion. One oreder  of fries feed us both and the atmosphere was real mellow."}
{"text":"Wingharts has, I think, the best burger in the city! Unlike Burgatory, you cannot build your own burger with all the toppings in the world but that is not a shortfall. You get a choice of a pretty good array of burgers but not an overwhelming amount. I've heard that their pizza is pretty good but I haven't had it since the burgers are hard to turn down. Definitely a must if you are going to be downtown or in south side. I believe they are opening one up in Oakland right where PCAFE used to be for all you Pitt alumni. Although the memories are fond there I don't know if I would trade them for this burger joint but it would be a tough decision. Let's just say that the students who go to Pitt now are lucky to be exposed to such a Pittsburgh gem, I hope they take advantage of it!"}
{"text":"There is an opportunity for someone to open a great place for lunch around here ... This place is not the place to do that. My daughter's pepperoni roll, burnt.  My chicken sandwich, underwhelming.  The waitress was nice though."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience here with their service staff...so disorganized! If it is possible to give this place negative star for their service, I would. For a place that just opened, it is quite grungy. The stools are old and the seats peeling off.   I lost my ID here and after three phone calls, four visits and countless promises...it took them exactly 2 weeks to get me my ID back. That just shows how disorganized they are and how terrible the staff members are at communicating with each other. Never again will I step into this Oakland Winghart location. They need to get their act together."}
{"text":"We were visiting this cool and eclectic city from Cali.  Tried to go to the Pretzel Shop, but it was closed for the 4th of July long weekend.  We decided to try Winghart's for a late lunch.  We walked in and sat ourselves at table as no one greeted us.  The man at the bar (looked like he was the only one working) saw us, but didn't say anything.  We decided to give him a few minutes to finish whatever he was doing.  Well, after five minutes, he never came over to take our order.  There were two people in the entire place, so no excuses. He seemed too busy behind the bar throwing back drinks with the other 2 patrons. Maybe we weren't the \"type\" they serve there. Walked out. Based on their reviews, looks like others have had similar \"service\" here."}
{"text":"We stopped at Winghart's after a long day of moseying around Pittsburgh.   I ordered the \"Shipwreck Burger\" (sans bun for a gluten free friendly meal) and thought it was pretty decent, albeit overcooked. The toppings were what made it - brie, caramelized onions, bacon, arugula, and white truffle aioli. It was a litlle heavy on the aioli but that was rather easily fixed. Hubby got the \"I Don't Care, Whatever\" with pepper jack, bleu cheese, cheddar, jalapenos,caramelized onions, pepperonicini, hot sauce, and bacon (also sans-bun) and felt the same as I - decent (and overcooked) burger, really good toppings.   In full disclosure, we did not notify the waitress of the overcooked patties - we just didn't want to wait for a second one to come out and hold up the rest of the party. Honestly I think it should come out right the first time anyway, but I know one can't really complain unless they try to rectify the problem, so no star lossage for the meat mishandling. :)  We split a side of fries which were a little too greasy/overcooked but seasoned well.   We sat outside so the \"ambiance\" was great - we got to people watch and enjoy some nice weather. Service was just fine.   It was generally a 3 star experience but the breadth and creativity of the menu, both with burgers and pizzas, bumped them up one star."}
{"text":"As of last week, they have not yet obtained their liquor license, thus no whiskey yet in this burger & whiskey bar.   The dinning room is skinny and long, with kitchen and what will be the bar along the side.  You can either sit either at the bar, or at the bar table towards the back.  Seats are fairly limited, however the food is phenomenal.  I ordered a gourmet burger with fries, which was simply fantastic.  While I was eating I watched the chef prepare a Greek pizza, which looked delicious as well. I am definitely planning on going back, especially when they can serve whiskey."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!!!! Good atmosphere, which varies from the first to second floor. Ordered the shipwreck burger as recommend by so many. Outstanding! We also had mac and cheese, fries and drinks. Everything was great. We are on a trip but we will be back before we leave for sure."}
{"text":"Cool vibe; liked the drink/beer selection.  They ran out of root beer, orange soda and lemonade. The kids were bummed... Other than that great service, great burgers.  I recommend it"}
{"text":"114 other people have reviewed this place, so I don't think it requires my usual detail.   That said, I think it bears stating why this place takes a 5-star review from me and not a very respectable and quality 4-star review:  When you order a burger here cooked to temperature, they do it exactly right, and the way it is supposed to be. Medium should have a pink center. It did. Medium rare should have a warm red center - it did. I am completely over places that try to sound cute and trendy by offering \"pink\" and \"no pink\" as the temperatures on their burgers. That is not cute, it is not helpful - it is a worthless binary scale.   If this place can get it right, in the low light and with all the toppings and add-ons, everyone should be able to do it. Winghart's, for the win."}
{"text":"So, I'm really unsure on how I want to start this review because I feel rather conflicted. I came into this restaurant with high expectations (formed mostly by my own interest) and was hoping I would come out in love. Well, I was in love, but not in as much love as I was hoping.   The burgers - Definitely fresh and quality A meat, but my only (and it's somewhat small) disappointment is the over-seasoning of the meat. The beef is great on its' own and didn't need to be masked by the additional seasonings. The bun was excellent (fresh and almost sweet) and went well with everything. It was a bit sloppy -- but what burger isn't? Overall, I loved mine and I got the shipwrecked.  Other food - I got coleslaw because I was very hungry, and it was quite good. It came in a Styrofoam container that resembled something from a fast-food joint, and for the price of everything, I wasn't fond of the lack of presentation. The fries were great, simple and homemade, but I do have one minor complaint. While they were good (and I'd take them over most other places), they lacked any seasoning and I felt like what was in the meat could have been utilized more on the fries.  The place - Very cool and hip. It's a mix between casual with high-end tastes. It's very small though. Walking behind the bar is tight and there are only a small handful of tables. I think this added to it's downtown uniqueness, but it seems like it can't accommodate it's own popularity.  Overall, I really enjoyed it and I will be back. Again, I had high expectations and a slightly underwhelming experience, but 4 stars (almost 3 at times) is all I can muster. I will definitely be back, because at the end of the day, it's a burger joint and it does them well."}
{"text":"great service in both locations i have been to. the one in market square. and the one in south side was actually nicer."}
{"text":"We were served a raw burger...you could scoop the meat out with your finger it was that raw. So we sent it back....we got another raw burger. The only reason for the second star is because the truffle fries were good. Pretty hipster place which I'm not into, but I might give them a second chance...actually probably not."}
{"text":"Ok, no seriously, this isn't hype, it's love.  For months I have heard about Winghart's and their burgers.  So finally I have a chance at checking it out myself and it was pretty flipping sweet.  We walked in and were immediately greeted by the SUPER friendly wait staff.  I didn't even need a menu since I had checked them out, I wanted the Shipwreck burger.  Shipwreck was there and he came over and talked to us while our burgers cooked.  Now here's how I knew I was blown right out of my body.  Mid-conversation the cook placed the burger basket in front of me and I went for my first bite.  All I remember is Linda W. and Shipwreck continuing the conversation while my entire world came to a screeching halt.  Out of nowhere all of my senses converged around an explosion of flavors and textures that only happen once in a blue moon.  Yes folks.  It was that good.  I mean, in hindsight I probably looked funny.  There I was mid conversation all lively and attentive and then the next thing you know it is taking every ounce of self control from taking more bites before properly chewing and eating the bite I had already taken.  Like seriously in my head ... I could have jumped into a pool filled with Shipwreck burgers and wrestled for a world title. (Yes the visuals are ridiculously disturbing...but it was that much of a positive assault on my synapses).  Ok.  So onto the objective portion of the review:  the burger was excellent quality.  The cheese (brie) was properly melted and tasted like a high quality brie should.  The caramelized onions were sublime, perfectly browned and sweet.  The bun was warmed and soft.  The bacon was savory and chewy (not a fan of burnt bacon) and the hamburger itself ... that's darn good meat.  Overall each of the flavors played with each other and took their turns playing with the palate.  The burger cooked medium well was closer to medium than well done (kudos to the cook!) so the juices were still flowing which added to the desire of eating faster since the messiness was OH SO GOOD.  In addition to the burger I got to try their fries which were also yummy good.  Peanut Oil made for awesome fried texture and the sugar(at some point in the preparation) gave the sweet salty combo that made this fries (still tasking like fries should) have a unique taste.  Almost like a distant cousin of sweet potato fries ... just still clearly potatoes.  I can't wait to go back and try a different burger.  I'll have to force myself to do so and also try their pizzas.  This is easily one of those situations where the tempting to sticking to the same rapturous meal might be too strong, haha."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE! ACTUALLY NO SERVICE!  It wasn't even busy and the bartender was so busy flirting with two girls that for ten minutes he didn't even acknowledge us.  We eventually walked out."}
{"text":"YUM! Went here for dinner last night before ice skating. Absolutely amazing service, the server came by several times to check on us. He was very funny and personable. To drink, we tried the Flannel PJs which had a nice spice to it. I got the Sweet Georgia Brown pizza (BBQ, cheddar, chicken, onions, and pineapple). My one complaint is that it had a ton of BBQ sauce on it; I should've asked for just a drizzle of it. My boyfriend made his own burger and then we split some fries.  And wow. It was a ton of food. Our original plan was to split a pizza and fries but he decided to try a burger. In the future, I think we'll split something because this was so much food. Definitely worth the price in my opinion."}
{"text":"While I would like to write post about how much I love Wingharts, that review would only be a lie.  The burgers are not that good, and fairly expensive.  I don't mind paying for a good burger, like when one goes to Burgatory, but this place just leaves you wanting more."}
{"text":"The burger was cooked perfectly served on a soft bun. I especially liked the Uber Manhattan! They use rye and bourbon with cherry versus orange bitters. Just like I like it. Balanced"}
{"text":"It's been a few years since my last review here, and in that time Wingharts has undergone a menu overhaul and a remodel after they dealt with a fire a couple years ago. Fortunately, they're still the best, despite/because of the changes! And they're going so strongly I think I have to brag on their behalf a little.  For starters, I'm actually really super impressed with the remodeling this location went through. Wingharts admittedly really looked like a bar when I first visited this spot, not a burger or pizza joint. Now, the remodel has given the owners a chance to add some great decor, color, and lighting to the place - and I definitely think the new touches make Wingharts more welcoming.  More importantly, while the menu has changed a tad, it's still absolutely amazing! In the last month I've been here three times and I've gotten three different and excellent meals:  *During a lunch out with friends I discovered this burger and pizza joint serves an amazing spinach salad! Fresh green spinach, gruyere cheese, bacon, sliced egg...yum! It's called the Popeyes Guilty Pleasure, since crabcakes are an optional topping here. I recommend them, too, because they are good crabcakes!  *Before seeing a comedy show I stopped in intending to enjoy a little pizza. Instead of having leftovers for the next day as I expected, I devoured an entire Boomer pizza - fresh dough topped with arugula, bacon, caramelized onion, truffle aioli, brie cheese, and crimini mushrooms. Now THAT is one delectable pizza!  *Finally, for my birthday I stopped in with a friend and we ordered two amazing burgers, along with an appetizer: their spinach and artichoke dip. This may be my favorite dip in the city - it's so fresh, filled with flavor, and even comes with a small \"kick\". And while I will forever love my Shipwreck burger, I can now say the Market Square Burger is a cheesy delight, with mushrooms and bacon to boot.  Oh, and the cherry on top of this already winning lineup? The fantastic cocktail menu that is full of refreshing and super tasty drinks all around. I haven't had a single drink I didn't like here yet, and it's common for me to order more than one of them while I'm here. Usually I avoid this to save cash, but they're so good here I can't resist them.  So kudos to you, Wingharts - you're definitely still one of my fav places to dine and drink at in the 'Burgh! Keep it up, please!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect late night meal place! It's perfectly situated in Market Square and has a casual ambiance. We ordered the Buffalo/James-O wings. The sauces were definitely good. I personally preferred the James O wings. They had a hint of sweet with a little spice. The wings were probably a little on the softer side; I like for them to have a little crunch.   The build your own bacon burger was to die for! Once I tried it, I could see why most patrons prefer the burger. It had a distinctly grilled flavor and the toppings were fresh. I also loved the juxtaposition of having cold condiments. Similar to having warm syrup for your pancakes; it sets the dish apart.   Our waitress Kelly was awesome! She made us feel right at home from the moment we came in! She gave great menu suggestions and wanted to make sure we had a great time! Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Looking forward to them reopening! As of today, their voicemail says they're still closed from the fire."}
{"text":"Perfectly cooked, very juicy burger. Somewhat of a cool dungeon feel (in a good way) in the dining room which would be great for a late night bite."}
{"text":"By far hands down the best burgers I've ever eaten! Shipwrecked my favorite and the pizzas are so good! Love it! NOM NOM NOM :)"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh is approaching \"Burgherville\" status considering the number of  hamburger places around these days.  It's mighty competitive for the King Burger crown.  I've been a huge fan of Winghart's in Market Square where it all began for this little beefy enterprise. I still love the small artsy dive vibe going on here but they have got to step it up in the cleanliness and décor burger lane and pay more attention to their customers.  It's just too laid back anymore.  They couldn't be bothered repairing the stuffing oozing out of the chairs, wiping down the table, or cleaning the walls.  It was sort of gross, to be honest, because burgers are such a \"roll up your sleeves and dig right in\" kind of food.  You don't want to feel dirty table while enjoying your delicious burger.  It takes something away from the experience.    Draft beer list is still killer and the burgers were good but the fries were waaaaaaay overdone crispy husks of former potato glory.  Thank God for Heinz ketchup. C'mon Winghart's, get back in the game."}
{"text":"Tons of great craft beers deff should try the cone head summer wheat. Some of the best French fries and with the beer cheese absolutely perfect. My shipwreck burger was amazing deff plan on coming back to try more."}
{"text":"I would give this a 5 star but the service was terrible. I was upset at the fact that our waitress was paying us no attention for a good 20 minutes until we took our order with another waited. But I must admit, the food was amazing though. I came here with a group of friends all the way from New York after the Rangers played the Penguins. We ordered the well known burger, the shipwreck which was perfect! The pretty good chicken burger was pretty good haha. The white truffle fries were the best fries I've ever had!!!! The Mac and cheese was also really good. The wings were great, everything was great! Definitely a place to try!"}
{"text":"Solid shipwreck burger with all types of goodness inside and good brews, ambiance was quiet on a Wednesday night. Staff was friendly and accommodating as well helping find seating for a group of 5-6."}
{"text":"Great place before theater... service always good... love to eat on balcony in season ... love all mac & cheese combos"}
{"text":"Food is great but you wait almost an hour for your food every time..... Not worth it. This happened to me the last three times we went, will not be going back to eat anytime soon, which sucks because the food is generally very good."}
{"text":"Winghart's is a pretty small place with limited seating, but the food is worth it. I had the spicy and delicious chicken tikka masala pizza (Punjabi Pie) and my husband had the Hula burger and was not disappointed! I wouldn't say it was the best burger we've ever had, but it was worth a trip and we will most likely return. Truth be told, I actually enjoyed the pizza way more than the burger."}
{"text":"Soggy fries, basic drinks, average food at best... not a bad atmosphere but with as many choices as there are probably won't choose this one again"}
{"text":"Based on the rave reviews on Yelp, I just had to stop in on my last trip to Pittsburgh. It was a beautiful spring day so we sat outside on the 2nd floor patio which is ideal for people watching while overlooking Market Square. Now onto the food...I assure you that the Shipwreck burger is the best burger that I have ever eaten. The white truffle aioli and caramelized onions were the perfect accompaniments on the burger. The seasoned fries were awesome & unique. I swear there was just a touch of nutmeg in the seasoning. Adding a Leinenkugel Summer Shandy to my delicious burger & tasty fries made it an absolutely perfect meal!"}
{"text":"I have to say this was fantastic bar food.  I have been coming to Pittsburgh for work for 7 years and This is one place I had yet to try.  I'm so glad I did tonight and regretting not trying it sooner.    The bartender Doug was fantastic.  I loved the artful mixology truly a highlight to my diner.  There was a fantastic diverse group of people that were so friendly.    I ordered a chicken sandwich with a fabulous perigee, sautéed onions, and mozzarella.  Best fries in Pittsburgh.  Ask the. About their process to make them it's three steps well worth the wait!    Highly recommend and can't wait to try it again!"}
{"text":"Got the Shipwreck burger and more fries. Really good!! Full of flavor, never had a burger with brie before but I loved it! The mojo fries taste like ranch doritos but better, they've got a hint of a sweet orange zest taste to them that blends in well. Will go back to try the Mac & cheese and pizza."}
{"text":"I do not know what was better. The nice selection of beer and whiskey, the absolutely amazing food, or the friendliest staff in the South Side."}
{"text":"This was surprisingly excellent! Elevated bar food with flash! Burger was perfectly done, service was quick, food was hot. Would highly recommend if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Flew into Pittsburgh airport last Friday and immediately Yelped \"Burgers\" nearby, sorted by highest rated and decided on Winghart's in seconds. This place is located in downtown Pittsburgh, so if you're traveling and want to see the core of the city, this is perfect. Lots of other restaurants and shops around it, too, so it's a good spot to start exploring.  I dined with two others and we made a point of trying as many things as possible. Two types of wings (Balsamic and Garlic were best - both were very crunchy, which I like; still feeling remorse over not ordering the Blacked & Bleus, so order them and let me live vicariously through you); pierogies (SO GOOD! MUST. GET.); burgers (LOVED the Shipwreck and heard rave reviews of the I Don't Care Whatever); great fries (get them topped with truffle oil) and we couldn't leave without a funnel cake (get cinnamon).   Great atmosphere. Awesome beer list. If I lived in Pittsburgh, I'd definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"Edison bulbs and romance...! This place is a great 'respite' from the Carson street crowd.  Come on in for a drink, an 80's style music theme and a great burger...  I stopped in to use a Groupon for a couple burgers and this place was UBER comfortable...  Enjoy the peace & quiet w the one u love before hitting a busy bar like Jacks, Smiling Moose, etc....  you won't regret it...   I'm drinking the New Belgium Citradelic at 6% but I wouldn't suggest that right now- it's kinda flat..."}
{"text":"A hole on the wall on Market Square. Good food, good service. Next time I am back in Pittsburg, I am coming back again.  Love the dockworker sandwich with everything, that's including coleslaw."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out at the bar, enjoy a draft, whiskey or bourbon, and nosh on pizza or burgers. I asked them to cut my Shipwreck Burger in half, but I devoured the whole thing - so delicious!"}
{"text":"Burgers were amazing! Truffle fries were awesome! The funnel cake looked amazing with the peaches, but we were too full to get it. Everyone was super friendly and everything is very fresh!!! Definitely a great place to check out!"}
{"text":"You will like this place if you like a wild crazy atmosphere.  But I went for lunch and at lunch time I prefer a calm relaxing atmosphere.  We walked in early (about 11:45) and were told that we could sit where we wanted but we had to order at the bar.  I ordered the salad a la Pittsburgh with water to drink and it came to about 12 bucks.  We got the last table.  The place is tiny so I'd recommend if you're going for lunch you get there at 11:30 or take your food to go.    The place is loud and noisy with loud music and waiters screaming out order numbers.    As for the food, my friend got a burger without a bun.  It was very greasy. With no bun and the burger wrapped in paper and no plate, it was quite messy.  Because of all the fat in the burger her initial reaction was that it was very good, but by the end she was overcome by the grease.   I odered the salad as I mentioned.  It came in a cardboard box with grease soaking through the bottom because I ordered my salad with beef, which turned out to be the greasy hamburger meat.  We ate with flimsy plastic forks and knives.  Initially, I thought the salad was great, but I was also overcome by the grease before I could finished.  I realize that grease/fat makes burgers more tasty, but I don't think the food was good enough to compensate for the stressful atmosphere and high prices.  Burgers start at $8.50 without fries.  I think this is probably a good place to go if you like a loud bar atmosphere and greasy burgers aren't  trying to eat healthy and don't mind crazy prices."}
{"text":"Chris the bartender is probably the best thing to ever happen to this fine establishment. He accommodated my friend and I so elegantly this evening. We were on our way to a concert and said we wanted a concert cocktail and the drinks he made us were out of this world!!! Will definitely be coming back for Chris' hospitality. The best!!"}
{"text":"My roommates and I went here for dinner and had an overall \"meh\" experience.   We're cheap, so we went for the $5 PBR pitchers only to realize that their pitchers are small and only contain 3 beers (opposed to a normal 4 beer pitcher). Boo!   I got the burger with bacon on it (I don't remember exactly what it was called); I ordered it medium rare and it came out grey and hockey-puck like. Flavorless and a huge disappointment. The burger was $10 and didn't come with any fries/chips on the side, which puts it solidly in the \"overpriced\" category. We ended up ordering a size of fries to split and it was a good decision because they were crispy and well-seasoned.  The service was good but we were one of only a few occupied tables in there, so I'm not sure how it would be when it gets busy. Overall, overpriced and unimpressive. I would have loved to have a good burger and beer place in Oakland but this is not worth the convenience."}
{"text":"Best pizza crust I have ever had, really laid back and friendly staff, good variety on the menu for how tiny it is. This location is a little cramped and crowded, but I would absolutely go back again."}
{"text":"We showed up later on a weekday. The bartender was friendly and helpful. The food was good. The bar itself was big and it had seating other than at the bar. A good place to stop and have a drink if nothing else."}
{"text":"OK...this place rocks.  If you are anywhere near the downtown Pittsburgh area, you really gotta find your way here.  Great team, great atmosphere, awesome food.  I had the Cajun fries and the Chicken Tatonka pizza.  Both were absolutely stellar.  The pizza has a perfect spicy kick...and at the same time it has a bleu cheese touch that is different and REALLY special.  Chris (the Chef) was right there to talk with me about it...and he and the entire group were generous in their appreciation for me dining with them.  I'm a guy who travels everywhere on the globe and doesn't bother writing reviews unless it is really warranted.  Find your way HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Bartender wasn't very friendly. Met up with coworkers for some drinks after work and the place was dead. Acted like we were bothering him by ordering drinks.  After ordering a 2nd round, he spilled a full beer on myself and another. Offered a quick apology and tossed a rag for us to wipe down then forgot about it. Could have cared less. The 3 start rating is about right considering the only thing good was the food. Unimpressive amount off available beers to drink and pricey. Highly unlikely we will frequent this establishment again."}
{"text":"Best manhattan of my life. Food= not good. Had the boomer pizza upon recommendation here (you so rarely point me wrong, yelpers), but salty to the point of being mostly inedible. Sat in the patio on the second floor with the overextended bartender as the only server. He was good natured, made a mean cocktail, and I felt sorry for him- so I overtipped. Pleasant night, but felt I had to fight to get fed. Not so impressed."}
{"text":"Little bit of a dive atmosphere but I like the low-key nature of it. Burger choices were quite original and very yummy. Hubby had the Harper's and I had the Shipwreck. You could definitley taste the freshness; both perfectly cooked BUT could have been hotter. Fries=crispy yumminess! They were very tasty but if you like your fries soft, pass on these. NOT crunchy, crispy. Again, could have been hotter though. Beer cheese topping was a little on the salty side but pleasant with the crispy fries."}
{"text":"Hit this place on a Monday night. We were one of 3 tables.  So the service was stellar  I had the signature burger.  Interesting taste with Brie and the white truffle aioli but it mixed well. Niece had the dockworker. Loads of flavors and cooked perfect. Was only turned off by the waitress who after a brief conversation about the whiskeys they offer she proceeded to say the signature whiskey is not very good.  Not cool. Even if it was. Good came out hot and quick. Which it should have since we were one of three tables. Would go there again. They have many different beers to try, which I did not this time but will next."}
{"text":"While I've been to the South Side location a few times, the downtown Winghart's is my first and most frequent encounter with the brand.  Relative to the recently cooling boutique burger trend, Winghart's is by far my favorite (disclosure:  I still haven't made it to Burgatory).  The Shipwreck, Collin's Orangutan, and the \"I don't care whatever\" burgers are all great and exactly what you're looking for when in the mood of self-indulgence...  big, greasy, salty, and flavorful.  What I'm not crazy about however is this place anytime near lunch, dinner, or any major occasion at Market Square.  The location is just simply too small to handle any kind of volume (even with the new addition upstairs), and it completely destroys what would otherwise be a FANTASTIC watering hole (dark, grungy, good beer, good food, laid back, etc.).  I just can't stand fighting to get to the bar to order, or worse, having people fight over my back to order their own."}
{"text":"I can say I've been around Pittsburgh trying burgers and I was impressed with the flavor and doneness at wingharts. My girlfriend likes her burger almost raw and they delivered. The side of fries less than brilliant and friends got pizza that looked great but they thought was a bit greasy. App was the Beer Cheese Bacon that I looked forward to but in the end seemed alittle over done. Still my favorite burger in area."}
{"text":"After a long weekend of ethnic food and different cuisines, my friends and I decided to keep my final dinner in town very simple.  I requested we go to the best burger place in town.  Without hesitation, Winghart's was suggested.  I ordered the \"I don't care, whatever\" burger which has jalapenos and pepper jack cheese.  The patty was cooked perfectly to my requested medium.  The patty, though, didn't feel processed or tough.  The meat tasted fantastic and the burger was topped generously.  After stacking some fries onto the burger, because I'm apparently a Yinzer at heart, the burger reached it's max potential.  I can't tell you if it's the best burger in the city but I was certainly not going to question the decision to come here.  I was pleasantly stuffed.  Perhaps understated in this whole experience was the ability to sit outside on such a great evening and watch the liveliness in Market Square.  The atmosphere was wonderful, the food was even better, and when shared with great company and some cold drinks, I'd be hard pressed to find a better, more relaxing, and casual meal.  A great burger and a great representation of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings on different things about this place so make sure to read the whole review!   We chose this place because we like reasonably priced, good food and it's a whiskey bar! They do not take reservations which was kind of crappy because we knew there would be a wait. We went in and put our name in, we were quoted an hour wait, which was fine because we got to see the tree and grab drinks near by: yards! (Go to their yelp to see my review for them) Towards the end of our hour wait, we headed back to the restaurant. We had to wait another 20 minutes in a very cramped lobby entrance. We tried to grab a seat at the bar downstairs and grab drinks at least to pass the time and were told we couldn't have drinks until we were seated (horrible). We were finally seated in a small dining area upstairs, which was nicely decorated! Our server was a nice blonde who was very slow though. She finally brought the drink menu and never the whiskey menu until we had to ask at least twice for it.. (it's a whiskey bar; we shouldn't have to ask multiple times for it) The menu was great in that it had so many different options but fries should come with the meals. Our friend ordered a drink and they were out of the cider beer, so she ordered something else. Then, they came back to say to her that they were out of the food she ordered, so she had to order something else again, which is a pain, but they said it was on the house finally. I ordered the dockworker burger and asked for no coleslaw but it came with coleslaw and they quickly remade it, which I was grateful for. Burgers had some hard fat pieces in it, but was cooked to perfection! Tried the wings and they were amazing!! Would come back for the wings! Pizza looked amazing too. Overall, not a horrible experience but very long experience."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: this may not be all Winghart's fault, we ordered off of postmates.   I'm very disappointed in our meal that we paid over $45 for. First, and again this maybe postmates fault but, we ordered \"a dozen\" wings extra crispy for $13. When it arrived the wings were far from crispy and there was only 8 of them. I never would have paid $13 for just 8 wings. Secondly, my wife ordered one of their well known burgers and asked for it medium-well. The burger we received was rare at best... Completely inedible for my wife, hence her medium-well order. Lastly, she asked for the sauce on the side because she was not sure if she would like it, and of course it was served on the burger instead of on the side. When we called to ask for a refund or some other sort of compensation we were told there was nothing they could do and that they were sorry because they had a \"new cook.\" I wish we had someone right next to us to donate the food to because we had to throw the entire $45 order out. We will never be returning."}
{"text":"I made it back to Wingharts for the second time in a year. This time, it was at their new location in the southside (which I am usually loathe to venture to).  The beer and spirits list has grown exponentially to include all sorts of wonderful libations.   The mission however, was burgers, plain and simple. My girlfriend and I each got a different burger platter, as well as seasonal brews (cant get enough pumpkin or fall type beers).   I ordered the \"Whatever, I dont care\" burger, which was befitting for my current state of hunger and craving. Wingharts gets 4 stars because it took obnoxiously long to get our burger at 9pm on a Wednesday!  However, when it arrived, it did not disappoint. The gooey, messy burger that I remembered was still kickin! Pepperjack cheese and a generous helping of jalapenos (HAL-EP-EENO for trailer park boys fans) was delectable, solidifying Wingharts as my go to (sorry Tessaros) burger place in the burgh."}
{"text":"I love the Winghart's Shipwreck burger-it is in my opinion the best burger in the 'Burgh!!.   I used to go to the Winghar'ts in Market Square but after the fire, it didn't seem the same to me.  Part of it may have been the change in staff, but it no longer felt like a good atmosphere to me.  I have been to the Southside location several times since, however.  I found the staff very friendly and one of the bar tenders made me a really great coffe/liquor drink that wasn't on the menu.  She took the time to cater to what I asked for and it was also her favorite drink, so I knew she would take time making a scrumptious cocktail.  I do think the french fries are amazing if not soggy or over-cooked.  They can be on the salty side so I usually ask for no salt and they oblige. I thought it was wonderful that they did the pay what you can day a few weeks ago to support a shelter in the North SIde.  Best burger in the Burgh!"}
{"text":"They are open now on thurs-sat until 2am. Was a lifesaver for us. Service was amazing. So friendly. The eight of us were served by the manager and chef, Collin and Jeremy. We ordered the perogies, and buffalo and maple BBQ chicken wings, all of which were absolutely delicious. But I gotta say that the Punjabi Mac and cheese (tiki masala flavored) was the best. DELICIOUS. I was sober as the designated driver, and I was chowing down just as much as everyone else. Definitely recommend this place for dinner or even late night snacks or meals. I hear the lunch is delicious too. Would love to eat there again next time we're in town."}
{"text":"I never have written an online review before, but I made an exception for this place. I have been here several times, with each time being beyond amazing! The combo of a fun atmosphere, and unique servers just makes the place a destination.  The whole menu is delicious, but the veggie burger is by far THE BEST EVER. My server was a beautiful girl with blue hair and tattoos. I can't rate this place high enough. I work in the downtown area and try to eat here as often as possible. SERIOUSLY EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"My favorite bar & grill in Pittsburgh! Great selection of craft and import beers and (obviously) whiskey. All the burgers are great. Only downside is that it's small with limited seating, but eat at the bar and talk to the cook and bartenders. Everyone's friendly!"}
{"text":"My favorite burger in Pittsburgh! Always delicious - the meat is absolute perfection."}
{"text":"Came on Thursday night for a burger and drink.  The place is tiny!  We sat upstairs in the outdoor section.  I was thinking they were going to have a large drink menu with imaginative drinks but they just had a couple beers and \"anything else we wanted the bartender to make\".  I got the shipwreck burger and my brother in law got a bacon cheeseburger.  You could tell the meat was freshly ground, it was excellent.  The white truffle aioli was sickening by the end of it but still a very good burger.  People need to learn how to take it easy with truffle, a little goes a long way.  Vodka/soda's were strong and cheap!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing and always consistent. Unique menu- and I love it. Nice atmosphere - good music it's low key and just a nice spot to chill, have lunch, or have a few drinks or a combination of all. Highly recommended. Friendly staff and 2 levels. Outside seating for nice weather- sit on the deck and people watch. Definitely five stars."}
{"text":"Honestly, best wings (my husband and I had the BBQ and dipped them in a little ranch), and the best burger that I've ever had. I made my own burger with just American cheese, L, T, O, pickles, mayo, and ketchup. The quality of the meat was unreal, it melted in my mouth. Fries are amazing, too. A few hiccups with our drinks, but our server took care of it all and definitely made up for it! Can't WAIT to come back again."}
{"text":"Wow such burger. Much fresh ground meat. So crisp fries. Very bar. Wow that burger was wow. So best in city. Must go again. Try shipwreck it's so wow. Service was sort-of wow."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers--nice size (half pound) and properly cooked.  No frills with a good selection of beers.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Try the Shipwreck.   Really just get a burger and you'll be set!  I'm seriously considering moving to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Big fan of the Beer/chz/bacon funnel cake. Terrible for my health but so good for my soul!   The shipwreck burger is really good. Reminds me a lot of the meat your maker burger at Burgatory.   The homemade breaded chicken patty sandwich was really good. I will problably either get that or try somethign new the next time I go back"}
{"text":"When I start picking about the decor of a restaurant that means I am in trouble.  That means that I am not enjoying my  meal.   Here's what I didn't want to notice but noticed while dining at Wingharts.   The music that was being played was coming out of a visible iphone that was hooked up to a juke box.  One of the high top tables was stabilized by two dish rags folded and propped under the table legs.  We all jerry -rigg from time to time.   But I expect more from a resturant that sales $9.00 bugers. Moving on there were some horrific looking paintings on the walls. One which reminded me of the movie the Ring.   Yes  the shipwreck burger was delicious.  The pizza I got was not so great. While the toppings were good and the crust was warm the artichoke paste that was spread on it was only slightly cool.  The crust of my pizza did nothing to heat the artichoke paste. That was very distracting. So why 3 stars and not 4 or 5?   I really wanted a meal I could sink my teeth into but that's not what I got. It's probably my own fault for going to a buger joint and getting a pizza."}
{"text":"The food was good but not great. Very dark inside so make sure your battery is charged on your phone so you can see the menu.   Small place so don't bring more then a few friends. The burger was made perfect the cole slaw was good however if you want a vodka or tequila your selection is very narrow. They have a great whiskey selection for you dark liquid drinkers."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a burger.  I sadly did not have a chance to taste the whiskey of the month or the potato salad (which several people at the bar suggested had recently evolved to perfection) but I really enjoyed the rest of the meal.  The cole slaw was excellent and had that Pittsburgh blend of sour and creamy that we can't get out east.  Hats off to whomever put the first episode of ALF on the TV."}
{"text":"I want to love this place. I really do. But I don't. Let me explain.  I came here a couple weeks ago on a Friday afternoon for a late lunch. Pittsburgh is my and my husband's old stomping ground, but we're always up for trying something new. My sister-in-law suggested meeting here in Market Square. I fully expected to love it, since they have some of my favorite words: whiskey, burgers, thin-crust pizza. Sounded like a great way to kick off a weekend.   We walk in just after 2, and there's actually a decent number of people enjoying a late lunch like we were, and that was surprising in and of itself. Our server took quite a while to acknowledge our existence. We were perusing the drink menu, trying to decide what unfamiliar whiskey to try. When we in the process of ordering drinks, one of us asked for recommendations based on what we know we like, and all she gave us was \"I'm a beer drinker\". So, two strikes so far.   She brought the drinks, and we ordered our food. We all ended up ordering pizzas, since those are easier to share. My husband and his sister both order a pizza exactly as written from the menu, and I've got my eye on one that sounds good, bar one ingredient: mushrooms. I HATE mushrooms. I requested if I could get the pizza without mushrooms, and the server did not indicate that it would be a problem. She comes back a few minutes later to tell me that they can't do that, and I question why, and she indicates that the chef/cook won't do it. No further explanation.  I ended up custom making the pizza the way I wanted it, which was essentially all the ingredients from the specialty pizza without the mushrooms. No issues with making that one. Sounds to me like the chef/cook was being a diva, and I really can't get that attitude for a restaurant owner. While yes, I understand that food is often an art, you are serving people with different preferences and should be confident enough in your craft that you won't get offended when someone orders a slightly modified version of your original dish. Especially at a glorified hole-in-the-wall burger joint.   The atmosphere was dive-y, which was expected. Our table was dirty when we sat down, and we ended up wiping it down ourselves. I would recommend that they spend a bit of money to actually fix the bathroom door, rather than put in yet another partial fix to make it close and lock.   Overall, I won't be making this a part of my essential Pittsburgh recommendation list."}
{"text":"Winghart's was one of my Pittsburgh bookmarks when I got into town last week, but I wasn't sure if I'd make it there or not. Fortunately, thanks to Ken M persuading me to \"take one for the team\" and check it out, I was re-inspired to make a stop. Let's just say, it was one of the best decisions of my week. Having not eaten lunch, I stopped by mid-afternoon with a big appetite, craving for one their great burgers I keep reading about. The first thing I learned is this is their second location, on the South Side. The original spot is located across the river downtown.    As mentioned before, I knew I wanted a burger, but looked at the menu...well, card, of selections anyway. They don't mess around here; you're either getting a burger, a pizza or salad. There are about six variations of each or you can create your own. I eyed the \"Mattola Burger\" which is described as \"two 1/2 lb. beef patties with applewood smoked bacon and American cheese.\" Two 1/2 patties? Wow! I was hungry, but didn't necessarily have a death wish. Thankfully, you can order a \"half\" variety and I went with that.   I also ordered a pint of Dark Horse Fore Smoked Stout, but didn't get any sides (extra) thinking the burger itself would be good enough. Wow, was it ever! The medium cooked burger, made from fresh ground beef, was large, juicy and delicious. Plus, the bacon was actually cut up into small pieces and grilled with the cheese.   Just thinking about it again it making me hungry! I envy the Duke here."}
{"text":"I thought it would be so good. The menu. The Market Square location. How different could the Southside be?! Different. I'll leave it at that. Okay - no I won't.  My group of four headed out on a Tuesday night and were met with a nearly empty Wingharts.  Throughout the course of our visit one other table arrived and a couple of other patrons here and there. It appeared that the bartender was the only server on site, but not big deal consider the extremely light crowd. However, she still managed to be less than cordial. Barely a smile. Never a \"is there anything else I can get you?\" Dramatic, but asking for ketchup and mustard seemed like a chore.  That being said, the food wasn't bad. It also wasn't amazing. The two burgers amongst our 4 were very solid, but at $10+ for just the burger - we could go to Burgatory and get more for less. The falafel patty was decent, but the lettuce wrap and $1 pineapple were so...stupid is probably the best word. I don't expect much from a lettuce wrap, but it is possible to do it well. One wilted piece of lettuce laid on the bottom and one laid on top does not a lettuce wrap make in my humble opinion. And a few cubes of canned pineapple don't do it either. Burgatory wasn't the end all be all to me until this visit...but I think it is now."}
{"text":"Just went to Winghart's on Saturday night after the Steel City Con.  We had been given a 15% off coupon while waiting in line for the Con and decided to go there afterwards.  The atmosphere was really fun, a lot of cool murals and the menu had amusing food names and descriptions.  We waited a little while for our orders to be taken, but it was forgivable with it being a busy Saturday night after a large local event.  Our waitress was very nice.   My friends ordered the sour cream and onion perogies, and said they were very good.  The only downside is that one order only had three...kinda hard to share.  I got the Matolla burger, and thankfully ordered the half size.  It was still very large!  It was cooked perfectly and I really enjoyed that they crumbled the bacon on top instead of just placing strips on it.  I split an order of the plain jane fries with my friend and he and I both enjoyed them. I've seen some complaints about it being too loud and too dark, but that's sort of what I'd expect at a place with Whiskey Bar in the name.  Definitely quieter than your average bar. Overall, I really enjoyed the food and service and would probably return if I'm in Monroeville again."}
{"text":"Really good food! Our burgers were great and their fries are to die for! Only reason I gave four stars is because I thought it was a little salty but I don't use salt often so that's probably why. Nice place, good food."}
{"text":"I thought this place would be better. It was good I did enjoy my meal but it wasn't amazing or anything. I got the \"I Don't Care Whatever\" Burger because I thought it would be really spicy since it had pepper jack cheese, jalapeños and siracha sauce but it wasn't really spicy, and my cheese was cold and not fully melted. I did however enjoy the fries I got. I got the \"Dude Ranch\" and it was a sizable portion and I really filled up on them so that was a plus. If I'm ever in Pittsburgh again I might try it out again."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late dinner on a Tuesday night. No wait. Waitress was great. Sat outside even though it was raining. We Were not real hungry so decided to share a salad and burger. I got the spinach salad. Real bacon and you could tell dressing was homemade. Hubs ordered the Matolo or something burger. The large has 2 patties. Ordered medium well. One party was clearly not. We could only eat 1/2 of burger. Fresh and tasty. He has leftovers which will cook that burger just right. Great prices. Good beer list. A keeper."}
{"text":"I very rarely write a bad review about a restaurant but the patrons dee serve a heads up. This restaurant open only a few weeks ago so I have to keep that in mind. My fiancé and I went to Wingharts in the Monroeville Mall on a Sunday at around 4:30pm. There were only about 5 tables with people dining. When we first walked in, the hostess removed her earbuds and put down her cell phone to seat us. We were seated in the back of the restaurant right next to the kitchen which we immediately noticed was quite noisy. Our waitress came for our drink order while I was looking at the beer list. She informed me that the draft list was outdated and she pulled a crumbled up draft list from her apron for me to look at. We ordered an appetizer, the whiskey BBQ wings were fantastic! For dinner my fiancé ordered a grilled chicken salad but the waitress never asked about dressing. While we were waiting for our food, we were unable to hold a conversation because of the loud music and staff karaoke coming out of the kitchen. When the food came, runner didn't know where our table was and ended up walking past our table 3 times. (allow me to reiterate, we were right next to the kitchen) We got our door and there was no chicken on salad and my burger didn't come with fries. As we were eating, all we could hear from the kitchen was The staff talking about being drunk and hung over. Then an employee brought, who I assume was her child, into kitchen and she stayed back there playing with the staff for over 15 minutes this causes the waitress to take awhile to check on us. Shortly after we received the check our table was bussed while we were sitting at it. Not just plates taken away, but wiped down and everything!  As we leave, just when we thought it couldn't get worse, we walked past a staff member sitting on the floor by the entrance, on her phone eating from a plate. I understand taking a lunch break, but I don't want to watch you eat. I can honestly say this place has the best food and the worst service. I don't expect Wingharts to last long if this keeps up."}
{"text":"We only had drinks at the bar; this review is not for food. 1) staff made it seem like they were super busy and almost didn't have time for us. They were not. We could smell the staff from where we sat. 2) My husband got a double shot of Avion tequila silver. It was $21. The bottles cost about that. Seriously... A shot of cheap tequila for $21? No thanks. 3) it says \"Whiskey Bar\" outside. It is not. 4) no game or news on at the bar, instead: South Park. Really? Between the cheeseball decor and general terrible style all around, we felt like we were in Portland Oregon in 1998"}
{"text":"Oh man- great beer and AMAZING food!  Didn't know what to expect but got a 'roll' (\"roll ups\" on the menu).  It is the filling listed inside some thing pizza dough.  I can't sell this well enough- a perfect serving size and an amazing meal!!! So delicious!  My boyfriend and I tried them without having ever been here and we were love them!  This place is great, highly recommend and consider trying a \"roll\"!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend gets a special two-hour lunch break every quarter during the year, and we've started using each one as a chance to try out new restaurants downtown that we might not otherwise seek out. Winghart's has been at the top of our list for a while, so when Nicky's was way too crowded we made our way over to Market Square and were able to be seated immediately. We got to our table around 12:30 and were ready for our check by 1:00 pm, so that shows you how wonderfully efficient our experience was.  We decided to forgo alcoholic beverages seeing as how it was in the middle of a workday, but I would love to come back and peruse the whiskey list here! If there's one thing I love as much as burgers and beer it's whiskey. I ordered a burger with a few different toppings for myself, and Kyle got a pizza with bacon and cheese. We split a basket of fries. Our server very nicely went back to the kitchen and double checked to be certain that the hamburger bun didn't contain dairy. I really appreciated that! Our food arrived piping hot not long after we'd placed orders, giving us plenty of time to enjoy it. The fries were phenomenal and a perfect mixture of soft in the middle and crispy on the outside. They almost seemed double fried or something...very good. My burger was extremely juicy, and the tomatoes on it were diced. That was something I hadn't seen on many burgers before, but overall it worked really well. There are few things more irritating that biting into a burger and your entire slice of tomato coming off at once. The only thing that was less than perfect was that the bottom of my bun became incredibly soggy, but with such a juicy burger I can gladly forgive that. Kyle raved about his pizza after five minutes of focused, silent eating, so I know it must have been great. Our sever was attentive about refilling our drinks during the meal and brought the check quickly once we were through. I never felt rushed or worried that we wouldn't have time to grab our usual cup of coffee afterwards. Overall Winghart's was such a great experience, and I can't wait to go back and try more menu options and pair them with some whiskey!"}
{"text":"How this place is still in business is surprising. A few words to describe: unprofessional...ghetto...dirty. Too many other options to spend money at this place."}
{"text":"Had dinner and ordered the shipwreck burger with fries.  Food was good and service was great!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little indy spot. Friendly crowd, excellent food. The bartenders take of you like a friend. Highly recommended. You'll be family here in no time."}
{"text":"Do not get the spinach and artichoke dip. Do get a burger. An amazingly delicious - quite possibly one of the best burgers you'll ever have in Pittsburgh - burger.  I mean, that pretty much sums up all that needs to be said about Wingharts. The south side location has that dark, south side bar type feel to it - exposed  brick and dark wood tables - nice beer selection.  The 'Market Square Burger' was a great choice - bacon, mushrooms and gruyere, a winning combo - and cooked to perfection. The meat itself was juicy and flavorful - yum. Fries come a la carte and one order is enough for two or three people - seasoned and crispy good! The pepperoni roll app was great - the spinach and artichoke dip, not so great.  Went with a party of five - it did take some time for the burgers to come out, but it was well worth the wait.  Heard they have great pizza, too - can't wait to try it! Maybe I'll visit the Market Square location next. :-)"}
{"text":"First meal in Pittsburgh was the best i've had in a while.  I believe the burger I had was the \"Natalie\" .. and it was flawless. Definitely would come back"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, amazing wings, and an interesting, enjoyable beer selection.  I absolutely loved this little, tucked away place! After watching an entertaining light show outside of this restaurant/bar...we decided to stop in to explore the local beers on the menu. Now...I'm not a big beer fan, but it seemed like my weekend trip to Pittsburgh was all about exploring new and fun beers and it was so worth it!   I tried the Cocoa Loco Choco Stout, the Original Hand Cider, and the Sara Saranac Prism. I really enjoyed each and every one of them. The Choco Stout was not too chocolatey, the Hand Cider tasted like crisp apples, and the Saranac made me feel like I was on a beach somewhere enjoying an exotic beer.  We also decided to try the Balsamic Garlic Wings. These were seriously the best wings that I've ever had. They were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I really loved the flavor too.  I feel awful for not remembering our waitresses name, but she was absolutely amazing. She helped with picking out the beer selections and also provided us hand written instructions for other local bars to try in the area.  I will definitely be visiting this place again on my next trip to Pittsburgh! Love. Love. Love."}
{"text":"Good above the norm burgers.  Can't really think of anything remarkable to fill the review with, but is now on my list of regular go to spots downtown."}
{"text":"My experience here today was perfectly fine. I was a little surprised by how small and dark the place was, but ultimately it didn't bother me too much. My waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu which I appreciate. I ordered the Dockworker burger and I can say that it was very tasty. The meat was cooked exactly as I wanted and I enjoyed it. Again, a nice experience, but nothing really wowed me and made me want to go out of my way to come back. Good place though."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times now and each time gotten one of their brick oven pizzas. They would be considered individual sizes, but a few are simply to \"hearty\" to finish. One of my favorites is the Winghart Attack. It is effectively a pizza with an order of chili cheese fries on top and the only time that it was finished was when I shared a few slices with a friend.  The atmosphere is a dive and very tiny, but the food is really good, the staff was pleasant and definitely worth a stop as long as you don't hit the peak of the lunch time rush."}
{"text":"Gluten-sensitives, Wingharts now has gluten-free buns!  And they're yummy ones!  Hooray!    The food is really good, and the menu very creative.  It's a little heavy - you'll be dragging if you eat lunch here on a work day - and although I know everyone's taste is different, I do think they are a bit heavy on the salt.  The menu is quite pricey, but you pay for good, fresh ingredients I suppose.  The result?  I rarely eat here, but I always enjoy it.    This visit I had the Shipwreck burger.  The meat was tender, fresh, and cooked perfectly, with arugula, Brie cheese (also melted perfectly), white truffle aioli, caramelized onions, and bacon.  I don't do burgers often, but when I do, I do it in style.  Lol.    FYI, I have heard complaints from others about the music volume being way too intense here."}
{"text":"Best burgers in the city - hands down.  I like to think that I know burgers.  Whenever I go anywhere, I try their burger.  I had been in the clan that thought that Tessaro's had the best burger, but they will have to admit defeat.  Wingharts (do you pronounce the \"h\" or is it a silent \"h\"?) wins!  I had the Shipwreck burger which combined the best medium rare meat with melty, deliciou brie.  I think most things would be better with brier, but sadly it is not on the table in restaurants to add to things like salt or ketchup.  It should be.  It also had bacon, truffle aioli, carmelized onions (that might be the best carmelized onions I have ever had - I didn't know that was something that could be better than the normal awesomeness that is carmelized onions, but these are it) and arugula.  All in all, everything was perfect.  Seriously.  Nothing to complain about at all.   M had the veggie burger which I had been very tempted to get and since the brie burger was definitely not on the diet, I will get the next time.  It was a falafel patty that was awesome with artichoke spread, arugula, feta cheese and olives.    She also got fries, cooked in peanut oil and awesome.   I am going back next week.  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here looking for a more intimate experience than we got.  The reviews on here were a little misleading as to the atmos.  What this place really is: a place to go hang out and watch the game.  It's not really appropriate for a date or anything too \"special.\"    We ordered a pizza to split, some beers and then afterwards a round of old fashioned's.  The pizza was a little over the top (something with brie and mushrooms I think) but it was pretty good.  The beers were recommended by the server and were excellent.  The drinks were very well constructed.  Service was perfectly attentive.  I think this place could use a little bit of a face lift to improve the ambiance - there is some sort of graffiti mural on the wall where we were upstairs and it just didn't give off the vibe of \"I want to hang out here, relax and chat and drink whiskey all night.\""}
{"text":"Four stars if you're a student.  They have a great selection of craft beers on tap, durable plastic pitchers, and decent prices.  However, they have a terrible whiskey selection.  It might be better than your uncle's basement bar with the vinyl seats, but not by much.  The bartending staff on the weekend earns its money, tip them well, they have to herd and serve a lot of drunk ass students."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our recent dinner here.  The food was good but the mixed drink I had was overly sweet and just not too memorable."}
{"text":"I am disappointed to say I wasn't blown away by wingharts.. Maybe I didn't order the right thing, but I overall felt it was pretty average and nothing that I want to hurry back to.   We went on a Sunday evening, it was pretty quiet there compared to a lot of the surrounding bars in the area (which I liked). The place is gorgeous, I have to say that. The unique abstract table tops and the painting around the door on the outside was all done by hand (I watched the guy paint some of it a couple months ago). It's dark, but comfortable at the bar and it's an overall chill atmosphere.   My boyfriend ordered a burger, I ordered a falafel sandwich as well as a BBQ chicken pizza to share. My boyfriend enjoyed his burger and was happy that \"it didn't fall apart at all\" but it didn't blow him away. My falafel sandwich was good but again, nothing fantastic and not something that I would order again. They are known for their brick oven pizzas so I had high expectations. The BBQ chicken pizza was good- thin, crispy crust and topped with Caramelized onions, chicken, sweet BBQ sauce and cheddar cheese. The BBQ sauce was a little overwhelming and took away the flavors of the onions, cheddar cheese and chicken though.   Their draft list wasn't bad at all, they have a pretty large selection of craft beers!   It was an overall enjoyable dinner, but nothing noteworthy. I would like to return to try their wings, but I won't rush back."}
{"text":"I've been to the market square location a few times. Most recently I had a craft beer and the BBQ Pineapple pizza. They have a great beer selection on tap, alongside several mixed drink features. The food menu consists of a few apps, a selection of mac & cheese options, pizza, salads, and burgers (what they are known for). This location seems to be either super busy (big event days) or a nice mild busy. I was pleased to see the service in market square was much better than what I experienced recently in the Southside location. Waitress was very friendly and even though the pizza took a while she explained why and apologized... which is enough for me to relax and wait a few minutes longer.  The outdoor seating is both on the first and a few tables on the second floor balcony. Very nice way to experience the evening in market square!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in on 4th of July for dinner after doing some searching around for a new spot to visit. We started out with an order of craft beer which there selection was far from the amount some places have on tap but it was very well in the sense of the amount of beer they had to accommodate craft beer lovers.  Started out with an order of the Sweet Jame-0 wings which were very meaty, fried lightly not overly cooked, crispy. The sauce was that of sweet nothing spicy just sweet.   Burger time. Went with the \"Shipwreck\" Now when I picture a shipwreck of a burger it invokes double and triple patties, tons of bacon, cheese by the layers just a heart wrenching gut busting burger but this was far from that this was what I call a nice gourmet burger that was well balanced, cooked medium and had a great amount of taste to it with no dryness. I always try a piece of burger meat separate to get a good feel for the quality and it was up to par.   Location is on Carson St which at times can be a pain to find parking depending on the day you go but it was quiet so that wasn't an issue. Service was great and attentive. Prices seemed reasonable. I would def return to this location and try the Downtown also. 4 out of 5 all day."}
{"text":"Went in here on a Saturday at 12:45 with some friends for some pierogies. Checked the website before we arrived, it said bar opens at 11, kitchen at 12. Go inside to find one man screaming at the TV. Once he stopped, he told us that we could not sit down because he was the only person in the place, and just a cook. There was no manager, and no bartender, and no server. They had been open for nearly 2 hours! Curious as to why he bothered to even open the doors. He had no clue when someone would be showing up. Needless to say, I will not be trying my luck at this place ever again."}
{"text":"This is a small bar on Carson street.  It was recently remodeled to a more clean modern look from the wild tattoo look they had before. There is also an outdoor patio in the back  They have creative burger choices and food so I chose some fries and the burger with pineapple and some barbecue sauce, Tallulah Hula Burger..... It was not ..... that good. The flavors didn't mesh together right. The fries were too salty and ....    The service was OK but I wasn't crazy about the crowd either so.... I.... I'm done."}
{"text":"I was not overly impressed. I really wanted to like it. Overpriced. Ten bucks for an average tasting burger, and it doesnt even come with fries."}
{"text":"The burgers here are fantastic! People are very friendly too, especially Alex, haha, also handsome! The menu is pretty interesting."}
{"text":"Had a great burger here and will definitely be back. Had some cajun fries too. Kinda a bar atmosphere with a mostly younger crowd and can get a bit noisy at times."}
{"text":"I like Winghart's, but I much prefer the Southside location over this location.  The burgers and fries are excellent, much like the Southside location.  The burgers are always well cooked.  The fries are top notch, always crispy.  I typically get the Dockworker for the Primanti style with fries and cole slaw.  They use a cream slaw, which I prefer over vinegar.  The downside to this location is the space is much more cramped and they charge for siracha here.  It isn't an exotic ingredient, I don't understand why they charge for it at this location."}
{"text":"I enjoy Winghart's, but they could definitely be better.  The burgers are good and of good quality meat.  I've never had a disappointing burger.  They aren't the best burgers in the city, but are very good.  The beer selection and pricing is good.  The whiskey selection is amazing.  Their fries are horrible.  They are over cooked and over salted.  Overall, I'd say Fat Head's or Smiling Moose are better for burgers.  Winghart's is my choice when people want the burgers, beer, and whiskey trifecta."}
{"text":"For my first Winghart's experience, this was a good choice.  Asides from the parking snafu (hence the star deduction), it was a good experience.  Having wanted to try Winghart's for a very long time, and not having the time to stop in one of the other locations I was super excited to see they opened a location in Oakland.  Right down the street from where I work! (I'm being spoiled with all the good places to eat around my place of work)  I called my order ahead before showing up.  Good call there.  I showed up and still had a little bit of a wait, but not too long.  While waiting I took in the surroundings of the place.  they did a great job with the small interior they have.  I also like the patio/porch area they have.  Although I'm sure that could be annoying later in the warmer months, by that I mean you will have to put up with the college kids on their patio/porch firing up their grills.  However, I'm sure their food would not be as good as what you get here.  Speaking of food, let's discuss.  Of course my coworkers and I ended up ordering a ton of different things with one thing in common, hand cut fries.  The fries were perfect, I really can't say more than that, perfect.  I ordered the Dockworker, which my friends is nothing more than homage to a beloved Pittsburgh classic that could surely have it's own following soon.  Awesome fries, sweet Cole slaw, and the burger patty itself was cooked exactly how I asked for it to be cooked.  For once, I have seen a burger patty that surpassing the bun!  My friend ordered the Matolla and I believe we were in the same boat by being impressed by how big the sandwich was alone.  I can't believe I'm about to say this, but it was a huge mistake to order a side of fries.  With as big as the burger was, a side really isn't needed.  AND the price is justified for once.  I had heavenly happy burger dreams that night.  The staff were great as well.  Very attentive, courteous beyond belief and made me want to fight traffic, search for a parking spot and come back the next day.  You've won me over Winghart, yes you have."}
{"text":"There must be something about living in Pittsburgh that draws you to a sandwich that has both slaw and fries on it.  It's like you become trained to seek out something like this.  I didn't even look at any other burger on the menu because it's like my brain overrode everything else and I put the menu down.  Burgers are cooked to your liking and you will be asked that when you place your order.  I got mine medium well and I was satisfied.  This burger came out with a nice coating of melted cheese, kind of locking in that flavor that screams burger.  The slaw wasn't too tangy at all, it was more sweet than anything.  And those fries, oh my god, they added a nice crispiness to this thing.  Each bite was amazing.  Just so you know, the burgers do not come with a side.  So if you want a full meal, it is going to cost you a little bit more.  The burgers by themselves are a bit pricey.  I only had a burger here and it suited me just fine as I wasn't all that hunger.  I do have to say that this is kind of a hidden gem like someone said prior.  Market Square is quite the busy space and to be able to sit and people watch outside while you enjoy your meal is a nice added bonus.  It is kind of tucked away in a corner and allows for you to enjoy yourself in the middle of the hustle and bustle of this downtown oasis."}
{"text":"We were a group of in-a-hurry folks and the service was great. Speedy, efficient and anticipating our needs--even splitting the checks, unasked!   Oh, and the burgers? CRAYZY good. Seriously, my mouth is watering a bit just thinking about them."}
{"text":"As I look over the reviews from this business I can't believe what I see.  I've been here multiple times, and always had a good experience. Monroeville is SUCH better then the Greensburg location. The staff, to me is way better. The food we need to remember, is bar food. This isn't a grand resultant. It's a bar. So the food, from that standpoint, is delicious. Their seasoned fries are really good and you get A TON of them. Their wings are good and I've had a couple chicken sandwiches before that were also good.  But you have to try the funnel cake for desert!!! So yummy! Id come just for desert! Their happy house is super good too, try that out first to see if this place is for you."}
{"text":"Living near South Side Pittsburgh there are streets lined with bars. Clubs, dives and anything in between.. you name it you can find it. I like more of a laid back, relaxed atmosphere and Winghart's fits that bill. The bartenders are all good people and I've always had a great experience with everyone working there.   The bar and shelves are lined with tons of Whiskey, obviously and just about anything else you could want. They have a nice selection of craft beers that are great and even amazing mixed cocktails with fresh ingredients made on the spot. The food there is also pretty great.. they are known for their burgers and the truffle fries are delicious as well.  During the day and week days the bar doesn't seem to fill up too much, which is expected. On weekends it draws a crowd and has a more upbeat atmosphere. They have a jukebox that anyone can play which is always appreciated."}
{"text":"Winghart's is a relatively small place, but has a ton of whiskey to drink! If you're visiting you can take your drink to the edge of the overhang outside the entrance.  Their kitchen is appended to the bar at the very far end. They have a limited selection of beers here in addition to the variety of hard alcohol, which appears to be the businesses primary focus.  The bartenders were extra friendly and provided us with excellent service during our visit here."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience so far.  Two visits, no hits. Feeling really bad for Zach. Good location, but not enough there so far to keep me coming back.  Objective, transform the old Houlihan's... Score? absolutely nothing to write home about or to Yelp about either. Not much change and really no ambiance at all. I just don't get any vibe here. Disappointing is how I would describe it, I was hoping for good things here for food lovers and for the Winghart's family. Service was friendly and fairly prompt. Good service can go a long way to overcome other issues. The several burgers we tried here were not outstanding or even really good compared to other options available. I really, really hope this is due to the newness and possible the less than well experienced or accomplished kitchen staff. The unsung people who prepare the food is where it is at and if they are not on, then nothing will be on. My last burger experience was the Market Square Burger. This is a burger designed around it's accompaniments like all other of their named burgers. And what is this you ask. It is a burger with Bacon, mushrooms, and gruyere cheese. Winghart's adds \" I don't think I need to say more. Well, I guess I could mention that it comes smothered in house-made honey mustard dressing.\" My comment here, the burger was over cooked. Darn, darn, a real sin at a place like this. I asked for medium and it came out well done. Bad, Bad. The bacon was overcooked bacon bits, which really interfered with the mouth feel you want in a high end burger. The mentioned honey mustard dressing really overwhelmed all other flavors. Tried several sides and other entrees, but nothing stands out or merits its own mention.  Trusting in Yelp I have read reviews ot the other locations and understand that it can be hit or miss, but I read more hits. I am hoping that things get straightened out here so I can comeback and enjoy."}
{"text":"Great burgers and the most awesome mac & cheese!!!   The service was fast and friendly. Will definately go back there next time I'm in Pittsburgh---- NYC Girl"}
{"text":"I have been to this place three times now and I have to say that the burgers are fantastic!  Quite frankly, the reason for the three star rating is because of the price.   I just went here two days ago for lunch and ordered a hamburger with two toppings, french fries and a Diet Coke and the price came to $17.50. With tip I'm at $21. Pretty expensive for a lunch don't you think?  The moral of the story is Monroeville Is a big town with lots of places to eat.  I'm most likely going to pick somewhere else from now on."}
{"text":"So good! Stopped in for their burgers, a shot of whiskey and a beer. Their fries were delicious too...my burger had gruyere cheese, mushrooms, bacon and homemade honey mustard. I scarfed that shit. Ate all of it without shame like a champ. Out of about a dozen people, I was the only female.  That being said, I had no problem eating and throwing back good whiskey like the guys. Bartender was a sweetie too. This Michigan girl would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place was the bomb!! Just arrived in Pittsburg that evening and wanting a place to get a good burger and beer. Boy was I happy we strolled into this place! Burger selection was awesome as I can't remember the name of the one I had but it was messy good. You can tell it was fresh, band pressed beef. I also wish I could remember the waitresses and cooks names because they were all friendly and social and a good group of people. Even the customers were rad. And I did mention the good beer too. Green Flash Palate Wrecker was the first of many good selections that I had. We came out of there with good spirits and made sure the waitress came out with a fat tip!! When back in Pittsburg, I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I have to say, they consistently make the most amazing burger I've eaten. I get the Harpers Fairly Good, medium well. It's topped with a beef sauce, Boursin cheese, fried onions, and a fried egg. It's a $15 burger and it's worth every penny. I get it on lettuce, without the bun, so it gets eaten with knife and fork.  I've only tried this burger, but others have said the shipwreck is also fantastic, which I think is their most popular burger.  The drinks are always well made, and in the summer it's really nice to sit outside on the balcony looking out into the city and market square.  Just a really great place and a super awesome burger."}
{"text":"Awesome! This place is really great, the food and atmosphere are amazing. Everything we got tasted excellent, we sat in the upstairs bar and had a great time chatting with Admiral. The bar was quiet at first but it quickly got busy and you could tell Admiral was a bit overwhelmed. We had a great time and we really enjoyed our food, I'm looking forward to my next visit so I can try some fo the other burgers on the menu."}
{"text":"I've been back a couple times and have to say that this place is growing on me all the more. It's fast becoming one of my favorite burger joints in Pittsburgh and certainly downtown.  I've had some of the other burgers, such as the Shipwreck burger, and they are also fantastic. And yes, they're doing a better job at keeping the floors from being slippery on snowy/wet days."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers! Absolutely loved watching the World Cup game here last summer with friends and the view overlooking Market Square with the big screen on playing the game. Love the vibe around the restaurant and whiskey selection is good. Wings are awesome too!"}
{"text":"I just went in here the other day and tried the felafel sammie. Oh. My. Goodness. It was superb. Like actually excellent. Like even my dad and brother, who were yapping because they just couldn't believe I came to Winghart's and didn't get a burger, loved it. The artichoke spread was delicious, creamy and actual big chunks of artichoke [yum]. The red peppers were also very good, super flavorful. I was worried about the olives because I have never liked those purple olives [I don't even know what they are called] but they were just a perfect addition of flavor. And feta cheese? Heavenly. This is seriously something to try even if you don't like veggie stuff. I left full but not uncomfortably so and I still had about a quarter of the patty left. Mmmmmm!"}
{"text":"We've been to Winghart's a few times and each time they provide a decent meal.  This time, we went for lunch.  I opted for the RazzyFresh beverage while the hubby got a beer.  The RazzyFresh was refreshing, but after receiving the food, I realized it wasn't the best option.  It was a mixture of raspberry, mint and rum.  The mint was pretty overwhelming and when trying to drink it with my lunch it felt as though I was brushing my teeth while eating.  As for the food, I ordered the Garlic Parm wings with ranch dressing and an order of fries.  The hubby ordered the margarita pizza.  I had never tried their wings until today and they were fantastic!  Very crispy and flavorful.  I wasn't impressed with the fries.  They were all tiny pieces like we got the bottom of a bag.  The pizza was pretty good.  I'm more of a traditional New York pizza gal, so I'm more impressed with a good crust.  The pizza was a very thin crust, but was cooked well and the toppings were fresh and flavorful.  Pros: The food is good They are fairly consistent in terms of taste and quality The service is top notch The location is nice in a quiet section of Market Square The second floor outdoor seating is a unique view of Market Square  Cons: The drinks are a bit pricey The food is a bit pricey for the type of food you're ordering Parking can be difficult because, well, it's downtown, so, yeah (All of the cons are kinda expected from a Market Square joint)  Essentially, it's not our favorite spot, even in Market Square.  But it's a solid place to get a quick meal and a drink with friendly service."}
{"text":"TO BE HONEST I dont know how the food is.  We went there after a Pirates game, waited 10 minutes for a waitress while one of the cooks chatted at patrons at counter/bar and the waitress promised us a menu and to take some drink orders.  10 minutes later we decided our business didnt matter to them and headed elsewhere in Market Sq"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday and was slightly impressed.  I'm always looking for new places to eat in Pittsburgh and especially downtown since I work there.  The first time I walked by this place I thought it was a tattoo parlor (strangely enough it has a similar vibe going on inside).   You order your burger (or other food item) at the register and then mostly fend for yourself for a place to sit and eat here.  The place is small but cozy and we ended up finding a spot at the bar.  The burger: it was very good, but overcooked (and not cooked over an open flame).  I got the Shipwreck burger (arugula, brie, bacon, caramelized onions, and TRUFFLE OIL).  I ordered mine medium rare and got something that more closely resembled medium well.  My fault for not sending it back, but I was hungry and didn't feel like waiting.  The combination was very nice - a nice bitter bite from the arugula, some earthy sweetness from the truffle oil, some gooey goodness from the brie, and a nice salty crunch from the bacon.  Everyone in our group (there were five of us) mentioned that they would definitely be back.  Would I be back? Yes, but not til the whiskey is flowing (they noted that they'd have liquor in about 2 weeks).    Conclusion: In my opinion, a 5 star burger joint needs to cook their burgers over open flames, PERIOD.  Til I find a spot like this in this city, the best burgers I've had in Pittsburgh have been cooked on my charcoal grill!!  I give them 3.75 stars (rounded to 4 since they're a new and budding place and also have future plans to serve whiskey!)."}
{"text":"I visited Wingharts a little over a year ago. When I moved to Downtown Pittsburgh a little over a month ago, one of the first places I walked to Wingharts. Only to find they were closed due to a fire.   Yesterday (8/1/2015) when walking around market square, I saw the lights were on. After burgers, fries, and wings with my friends, Wingharts is just as good as I remember! Do not pass this place up. One of my favorite burgers and wings places, anywhere.   Glad to see them open again!"}
{"text":"Great Burger (Shipwreck burger ordered medium rare), Great Beer selection, with a good whiskey selection (doesnt seem to be as well versed as Piper's Pub).  Burger was quite amazing; On par if not better than BRGR and Burgatory, but instead of shakes, they have a better beer and whiskey selection."}
{"text":"GREAT little dive-y burger bar located in a sea of restaurants the surround Market Square.  Definitely not the flashiest place on the block, but they serve up some killer burgers!  The main seating at this place is along the bar, which I'd highly recommend, as you can watch the cook fire up an array of beefy masterpieces.  I ordered the Shipwrecker--could I really resist brie, bacon, and white truffle aioli?  One of the best burger's I've had in a while--perfectly cooked to medium, great bun, and you could tell that the toppings were high quality.  Fries are also delicious, although I kind of wish I would have ordered a side of the aioli to dip them in!  If I lived in Pittsburgh, I'd for sure find a way to be a regular here!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for food during a holiday visit to the Pittsburgh area. The place was incredibly slow. At issue seemed to be the holiday craft fair going on at the time, and people flooded in after us as it began raining outside. A second waitress was necessary to help handle the Sunday event traffic, apparent friction between staff didn't help to streamline things. Our biggest bottleneck was just getting an order placed, which the staff behind the counter could have picked up to help get people in and out quicker.   The wait aside the food was excellent. Music playing was all 90's / 00's rock / punk. The place felt I'd walked into Golden Boy Pizza back home in San Francisco, I was taken aback at how familiar the place was for having never been there.   I got the impression that the slow service was an unusual circumstance. I'd come back, when things are less busy next time."}
{"text":"We came here because the lady who owns the kombucha store across the way recommended them. They weren't quite open when we made our way over there but the guy who came out was very polite and asked us to wait a few minutes. When we were able to go in all staff were ready to get started immediately. Our waitress came over and got our drinks within minutes. The place is very dive-y, kinda rundown looking, not a lot of light, but everything was clean. Pierogies..... they are ridiculously yummy and homemade. The dough was so chewy and thick and the filling was very flavorful. I got their version of a Greek salad. I'm lazy so the fact that everything was cut up into bite sizes made me happy. My husband got a burger, ordered medium well. Most places can't figure out how to cook a burger that way, but they nailed it. We were very happy with the speed and quality of everything. Plus, it's locally owned so that is a plus. I say, walk past Primanti and hit this joint up, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped in at 11:30 at night. All of our food was outstanding. Not just like acceptable for that time of night, but what I would expect from a more prime lunch or dinner time."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from California and didn't know that a food I was raised on, pirogies, is apparently big here. Anyway, yelped this place, came, ate, and had my mind absolutely blown by their \"Grandpa's Pirogies\". Absolutely excellent. Service and location are great too."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and watched the cook make burger patties then pull lettuce out for a salad, touch all the buns, and all the toppings. All without washing his hands or wearing gloves. Eat here at your own risk."}
{"text":"Easily the best Pittsburgh experience of my entire weekend stay.   We walked in around 9:30 on a Saturday night and was immediately greeted by an employee who asked if we needed a table. We wanted take out and he was totally cool with that and offered to help if we had any questions.   It took us about ten full minutes to decide what to order, everything item looked unbelievable. Very interesting burgers and sandwiches, great flavor combos and all freshly made ingredients.   We finally settled on the \"I don't care whatever\" burger with their house made garlic chicken patty, the Market Square burger cooked medium and an order of white truffle aioli fries. Long story short, go there now and order all of these things. The garlic chicken patty was juicy and flavorful and the burger was giant and cooked perfectly. The truffle aioli was light and fresh and indulgent-maybe the best I've ever had.   The chef, Steven (or Country), went out of his way to tell us about all the sauces they serve and even let us try a few. He was so friendly and knowledgeable!   Check out Winghart's for the best burger of your life and some of the best hospitality in all of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Love this place! We've been wanting to try  it since it opened and finally got the chance tonight. I think one of the most memorable and I'd even venture to say my favorite part of my meal is overhearing a table ask for a Coors light and the waitress politely responded by saying they only sold craft beers and particularly tried to support other local business. They had me at hello and I didn't even order yet!  I obviously had the shipwrecked. It was fab!! The plus 1 had the market square burger, also good but not as good as mine. The burgers were perfectly cooked and the flavors were spot on!  How were the French fries you ask. Ha probably the best I've ever had...hands down.  The owner stopped over after we were done to check in and shared the secret to the amazing fries, but it's a secret so I'm not telling.  My only gripe is that I didn't really know what to do when I walked in. Should I look for a table, should I wait here..no worries I think they were focused on making some awesome food and being crazy friendly to the tables they did have.  Oh and if you're wondering... I ate the whole damn burger"}
{"text":"Always liked the downtown restaurant,  so I decided to try this location since there was a groupon for it. We had excellent service with our waiter Robbie. He brought drink refills and took care of us the entire time. I absolutely loved the pizza and fries that we ordered. I highly recommend their burgers too. They use the freshest ingredients in their foods....nothing is frozen or microwaved."}
{"text":"The restaurant (bar) is Small and narrow and we almost didn't stay. We figured with so many good reviews - let's give it a try. We were glad that we did! The staff was friendly and the burgers and the fries were great. The menu is limited, but if you want a good burger - this is your place."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in market square. I don't think I have had one bad thing here. It's all good!!! My favorite spot is the 2nd floor balcony to people watch."}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch with a friend and my 1 year old. Nice, friendly waitress. Kids menu. My daughter had the grilled cheese and fries. She liked it. I had a bite. I liked it. My friend and I both had the Mattolla burger. Delicious!! Definitely want to come back with the husband."}
{"text":"Dropped in from out of town needed some food late followed the burger accolades and it delivered, but to my surprise the pizza was spot on... chewy crust with some burn on it, love that and not exactly sure the cheese but super salty and extra punch, overall good stuff.  Wait I forgot I love bourbon and they had all the good stuff to wrap up the equation. If in town again will drop on by."}
{"text":"I've been to Winghart's for their burgers and chicken sandwiches and they've been really good. Recently, I had a craving for chicken wings like no one's business. When I checked my Yelp app I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Winghart's,  actually serves wings. I got the balsamic and garlic flavored wings and they were so good. Felt like they were made with a lot of love and I eat them with a lot of love! Seriously my new favorite place for wings!"}
{"text":"Tried to order the falafel burger at opening. They told me they sold out of them. So I got the crabby patty instead. Which consisted mostly of bread crumbs"}
{"text":"Best burger I have had in a long time! Fries with truffle aioli crispy and hot. Would highly recommends the food!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a great burger in downtown Pittsburgh. Winghart's did not disappoint. Great atmosphere and super friendly staff greeted us when we came in. I had the veggie burger and it was fabulous. The fries are some of the best that we have ever eaten. Great beers on tap too. Highly recommend this place if you are looking for a great burger."}
{"text":"Very slow, bad drink menu, decent food, no mangers to be seen. Margaritas were horrible, and the wraps were salty."}
{"text":"Winghart's is totally the cat's pajamas!  So many friends have told me to check out Winghart's, but seeing as I'm rarely ever downtown in Market Square, I knew it would've taken me quite a while. That being said, the minute I heard about them opening a location in the Southside, I was ecstatic. I was a bit apprehensive at first, seeing as a) I'm not big on burgers (veg-head here!) and b) even one swig of whiskey can make this lightweight ill! Given that, I was still mega impressed by everything they had to offer.  I went with pizza and got \"The Boomer\" (sounds like a real winner with a name like that, right?) sans bacon. It was a white pizza with mushroom, brie (OMGIWANTALLTHEBRIE), caramelized onions, arugula, and truffle aioli (OMGTRUFFLE). It. was. amazing. I felt a bit decadent getting a brie and truffle pizza, so readers/eaters (reaters) beware! It may be too rich to handle for one person. Admittedly, seeing as I'm an unapologetic glutton, I ate the entire thing. Goodbye, arteries!  Their beer selection here is also on point. Not only do they have a huge variety, they had my absolute favorite cider, Crispin! I was pleasantly surprised, since the only other place I've seen it in Pittsburgh is at Belvedere's in LoLa. Prices here are fair too, especially given the quality and quantity of what you get. Do your tastebuds a favor and check out Winghart's!"}
{"text":"Love this bar - great food, owner is super nice, cooks your food right in front of you and asks how you like it. My only reservation is that they have a particularly fruity draft beer selection with no bottles, and although I love a good draft, I'm not a big fan of beer that tastes like candy. I'll be sad to not be able to stop by as much after I finish my internship downtown this summer, but it'll definitely be my go-to place for dinner and drinks whenever I'm downtown."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!!  The meat is absolutely amazing.  What find!  I had a Hawaiian Pizza with super yummy ground chicken and my husband had a burger.  Boy, did he love his burger.  The fries were great too.  The only downside is the size of the restaurant.  It is quite cramped, but what they lose in space they make up in delicious food."}
{"text":"Small dive PHENOMENAL food (at least Burgers, Fries & Beer!)  Great staff- cooks rock!  Amazing all the way around!  Quick and efficient!!"}
{"text":"I felt like a big man in a small coat ;-) Okay - this place is small but perfect for my buddy and I on a Saturday Afternoon.   I have always wanted to check this place out and this seemed like the perfect time.  We sat down and I ordered some of their high-end shots of whiskey.    The first one was called Yam... something (okay - I was having a good day and all I remember was that there were a lot of syllables) and it was very good.      I met the owner named \"Shipwreck\" and tried their topshelf whiskey.   It was very good - a hint of smoke but still very good.   I believe that was fate because I knew if I kept drinking those - I would be shipwrecked!  The burger was very good.   I told the gents cooking my food (they saw me taking a picture) that I was a Yelper.  This helped because my buddy Brett - wrote a review and was there prior to me getting there had a different experience.  Overall - I would recommend for beers / whiskey and a burger.     I will be back :-)  Food - Great!   I enjoyed by burger and fries. Service - Awesome - our server even tried to get my buddy a candle for his burger - that would have been funny Price - I can't really tell - I ordered some high end shots which skewed my bill.  I think the burgers were about $10..."}
{"text":"Awesome Experience!  The decor of the place is pretty cool.   The bartenders were awesome.   They provided some suggestions on what to drink and what to eat.   Winghart's burgers are very good (Market Square).   The burgers here are the same.  I normally would take a picture of the food - but my camera was not fast enough ;-)  I tried two new beers they had on tap.   Enjoyed my time there.  A strong recommendation!"}
{"text":"Visiting on business and I really enjoyed the Beretta Veggie. One of the best veggie burgers I've had and it was a falafel patty. Service was prompt and friendly. Definitely have to visit again to try some other things."}
{"text":"I have never really taken the time to write a review about anything. . . .  until now. My fiancé and I went to Winghart's last night in Market Square.  I don't even like burgers as I very rarely (and I mean maybe once a year) eat red meat, but I got one nonetheless. Not only was it the best burger I have ever had, it was the best thing in general I've ever had.  Like EVER.  I had dreams about that burger last night and my mouth is watering as I write this review just thinking about it.  I ate the ENTIRE thing and it was worth every single calorie.  The fries were also out of this world.  Totally fresh and hot and perfectly seasoned.  I am telling you - you will not be able to find a better hamburger than this anywhere (and I am from South Texas so I know a thing or two about burgers).  My fiancé agrees.  The staff is so cool and friendly, which made the experience even better. We sat at the bar to watch the hockey game so we got to see the chefs make all the food in this amazing brick fired oven.  It is a total hole in the wall dive, but it's okay because the food is so good you don't even notice. I cannot wait to go back.   I had the shipwrecked burger last night.  The chefs also said the pizza is amazing.  I don't know what to get next!  I would give this place 10 stars if I could! If you are craving a good burger this place is a MUST!!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious & the staff was very friendly! I would definitely go back.  There was another customer throwing out the F-bomb nonstop at the food counter. Obnoxious. I was there with my kids so that made it even more annoying & ruined the experience a bit."}
{"text":"People have posted it's a dive bar, it's way too clean to be a dive bar. It is small inside with limited upstairs seating. The staff was friendly and let us sample the tap beers. The menu was varied and looked to have lots of choices. I had a burger with a pierogi on it that was really tasty. It was more like Salisbury steak on a bun. It was cooked a nice medium rare. The fries were crispy and covered in truffle aioli sauce, delicious! I'll definitely come back to try something else! A nice find!"}
{"text":"Good burger spot. I got a marshal burger that was good but a little sloppy and smaller than I expected. Better than Primanti Bros though"}
{"text":"What a gem!  I went here once about a year ago and had AMAZING pizza and they had a great selection of beer. They were closed for renovations and I tried again tonight.  So so good. Great staff. Amazing Pittsburgh salad. Garlic chicken patty.:: sounds crazy, it was delish!! Super cool and trendy interior and exterior decor. The quaint patio on the second floor is AWESOME!  I  am so happy I have rediscovered this place."}
{"text":"The only thing I've had is a pepperoni roll, but it was the best pepperoni roll I've had in Pittsburgh. I'm looking to go back and try more foods and whiskey."}
{"text":"The burgers here are some of the best in the city. Incredibly unhealthy in the most delicious sense. The pizza is good and the fries have a different, sweet seasoning on them. Pretty good place for a great burger."}
{"text":"Went there after hearing many friends rave about it.. we were disappointed.  My ( medium well  burger) came out still moo-ing. After flagging down the bartender and  ordering a new one, it was also extremely undercooked. He never even checked on me once the second one arrived, I had to  flag him down again. His excuse was, \"the cook was busy\". Not an acceptable  excuse for a 12$ burger with no sides I also ordered a martini, which was presented in a double shot glass. It tasted  meh.  The check was presented( after asking) in an odd format.. not broken down at all, just a total.    I will say the bathrooms are neat looking. To bad they were dirty when  I was there.  If you want a great burger I  highly suggest heading north of the city to Burgh'ers in Harmony.. they also make wonderful drinks there."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had outside of my home state of Wisconsin. The Blackened Bleu wings are also Divine. Everything tasted very fresh. Good variety of beers for not such an overwhelmingly large selection. Kelly, our server, was as good as they come. She was very on top of things, kept our many many drinks full, and has the bubbly personality everyone enjoys in their wait staff. They deserve the 5 stars because I literally had nothing at all to complain about"}
{"text":"I used to love this place but the more I frequented, the more I encountered bad attitudes and judgmental comments from workers and patrons alike. I wouldn't go there just to drink, but I would go for the burgers. Now I don't go at all. It's really a shame because I loved the beer selection, the specialty burgers, and the daily specials, but after getting the feeling that maybe this place is just meant to be sort of a club for regulars I just spend my money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Best. Burger. Ever. Service was slow but friendly. The drafts were great and the fries and burgers were slammin'."}
{"text":"I've been to Wingharts multiple times. As a Whiskey girl, I love their various selection and the Bartenders are usually fantastic; great personality, knowledgeable, and extremely service oriented. The food is well priced and for being fresh made usually comes out quickly and tastes fantastic.   I went yesterday and was absolutely disappointed. I ordered beer cheese and bacon fries. The fries came out lukewarm and the beer cheese was congealed and cold. My Grandpa Style Pierogies were extremely salty! I got through one before I couldn't eat anymore.   Considering how good the food usually is, I was very disappointed. I do plan on returning as I hope this was a one-time bad experience."}
{"text":"Best burgers in the city! Never disappoints, had a \"I don't care whatever\" and was delicious. My friend had a good looking (and tasting) chicken salad. Our server was fantastic, very personable. (didn't get her name) They have limited outdoor seating, but made for a great lunch on a beautiful day. I frequent the whiskey bar pretty often, but asking myself today why I do not eat here more often?"}
{"text":"Thank you, Yelp, for pointing us to Winghart's when a burger craving hit during our vacation in Pittsburgh.  Delicious!  The owner is a trained gourmet chef, so he knows what he's doing.  But this is by no means a dressed up, dainty, fancy restaurant gourmet burger.  This is a burger that gets the basics right.  The meat is fresh and perfectly cooked, and the buns are great.  The add-ons were also good, but you almost don't need anything on this burger because the meat is so perfect.   I love places where I can see my burger cooking.  The bar setting is complementary to the all-American menu, and you can't beat the Market Square location.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I bookmarked Winghart's months ago since it is so difficult to find mid-scale dining options in downtown Pittsburgh.  Based on the reviews, I was kind of disappointed.  This place is really not much more than A-OK, in my opinion.  My friend and I stopped in on a Friday night around 10:00 PM.  There are two floors, both with bar areas.  We thought the first floor was a bit grody since the kitchen is open, but the second floor was much classier.  We decided to sit at the bar, and the bartenders were great.  Very friendly and cool.  The place was about 1/4 full on a Friday night.  The food is normal bar food at kind of excessive prices.  The Blue Addiction Mac and Cheese ($10) was only big enough to be a side.  Additionally, it's just the regular mac and cheese with blue cheese tossed in for an extra $3.  The mac and cheese was pretty creamy, but it was over-powered by the blue cheese.  The Dude Ranch fries ($4.50) were more reasonably priced but still a small plate of fries tossed in ranch seasoning and drizzled in ranch.  They were fine fries for a bar but not special.  We finished this all off with a funnel cake ($7.25), which was on the cold side, considering they had just made it.  The burgers and sandwiches seemed to be a better price, but the other food was just lackluster.  The biggest issue is that if you have food allergies, DO NOT come here!!!!  We found french fries mixed in our funnel cake and vice versa.  I wonder how clean the kitchen is...  OK if you can drop your hard-earned money on mediocre food."}
{"text":"As with Burgatory, expect to spend $15+ for a burger and fries. I guess thats what you have to spend to get a good burger around here. Both offer the best burgers iv had in the Burgh. I got the southwest burger and cajun fries and both were exceptional. They dont microwave or freeze any of their food. You get what you pay for"}
{"text":"I have gad a chance to try their falafel patties too!  I think they are awesome!  Yes, they are not veggie burgers which is maybe why that one person said they didn't like it.  They are portobello falafel patties, which I like better than veggies burgers because they have more flavor  Long and the short of it, if you are expecting a veggie burger, its not going to happen (read the menu, it says it right on there).  If you want something with more flavor, then then falafel patty is for you!"}
{"text":"They have good pierogi, and their fries are pretty decent, too. But I've been here twice, and both times the waiting staff has put me off. The first time my friends and I came here, it was for their soft opening weekend. We come in, sit down at a table since the bar was full, and are greeted by a waitress who was very intent on giving us a menu. My friend takes one and we go up to the bar to order our drinks. They have a great craft menu (I'd recommend the Cocoa loco craft beer. It's so buttery.) and the bartender tasted beers with me, which I think is a good quality--if you don't know the beer, taste it so you do. We sit down and the waitress comes back over and asks us if we are ready to order. We tell her we're not going to eat anything and she proceeds to stare me straight in the eyes for a good 10 seconds before leaving and never once even coming near our table again.  The second time we went was the kicker, though. We come in, order some drinks at the bar, and then proceed to order food. The bartender (same one as before) gives us our drinks along with our napkins and utensils. We spot an open table and since there were no seats at the bar (we were standing), we pick up our stuff and go to sit down. Suddenly, a very angry-looking waiter approaches our table and asks us if we are ready to order. We tell him we already ordered from the bar and he goes on a mini-rant, telling us \"This is a table. I make my living from this table. If you order from the bar, you sit at the bar. You don't sit at a table.\" Newsflash, asshole: you can't sit at a bar if there are no goddamn seats. It's not like they even had a greeter at the door who could sit you, to imply the divide between bar and restaurant. The pissed off waiter proceeded to yell at the bartender, not once, not twice, but three times about us, as well as glare in our direction any time he could. The poor bartender closed our tabs almost immediately (as in, as soon as he gave us our food). But he still came over a couple of times to ask us how everything was. We ordered one more round of drinks before we left. I apologized to the bartender and all three of us gave him a great tip. Really, if it weren't for the bartender being so great, I'd give this place one star.  TL;DR The waiter was an asshole, the waitress was weird, and the bartender is awesome. Sit at bar, never tables."}
{"text":"I remember when I'd come in here to some hard rock and an awesome staff, but recently the place got a face-lift. The staff still kicks ass, but the music is lacking- it's like that of every other place in South side and it no longer stands out. The restaurant looks great, but lost the typical vibe I came to expect. But the food and the staff keep me coming back.  I just wish that was more frequent. It's got a great happy hour location, but offers no specials or deals to entice us in. It's a shame to see with so many competing restaurants on the block, a huge missed opportunity if you ask me.   All summed up, wingharts is awesome, but bring back the rock that brought the customers in and throw in some happy hour specials, and you've got a 5 star establishment."}
{"text":"Badass! Good music, great food! Just a really cool place! The service was friendly and the atmosphere was cool. The Shipwreck burger was excellent!"}
{"text":"My first trip to Winghart's, I would give 3 stars.  The atmosphere is mediocre at best.  The dining area is very cramped and close and they have about 3 sets of tiny Ikea track lighting.  Hopefully you have a flashlight in your pocket to help read the menu.  The food was good, but nothing special. It's basically typical bar food: wings, burgers, salads. I had an appetizer of wings, which were delicious and probably the major bright spot of the experience.  Very saucy and moist.  The burger I received was well-done after I had asked for medium; no big deal, but not a positive factor.  The fries were soggy and seemed overcooked. The wait staff is somewhat attentive, but they usually are short staffed (one waitress covering about 6-7 tables).  Overall, Winghart's is overrated.  For a typical bar atmosphere with little to no A/C (very warm inside) and mediocre food, it's overpriced and not worth it.   My second trip: disaster.  I wanted to give them another shot after my first trip described above so I took my family there.  First, there is no hostess, even at dinner time.  It's first-come, first-served.  Well, there were six of us in the party. The tables in the back dining area are tiny and so we decided to pull three together so everyone could fit.  We are rather small people too, and three tables was comfortable for all of us, but we didn't exactly have extra room.  The waitress came and took our drink orders (and the CO2 for beer and soda was malfunctioning, so the choices were water, bottled beer, or unsweetened iced tea).  After everyone ordered, one of the bartenders came back and asked where one of the tables next to us had gone as there were two or three extra chairs against the wall where the table had been.  When we told him that we were using it because we had a larger party, he snarled and asked if he could take one away. We kindly replied that it would be uncomfortable for 6 of us to try and fit at two small-sized tables as our knees would be knocking and we would not likely fit everyone's drinks and dinners on the table.  After asking us, and, in turn, us replying, he did not let it go.  He insisted that it was impractical for us to be using three tables and that he's seen 4 people fit at one table in the past.  After rolling his eyes and basically telling us we were being absurd, my party and I decided that Winghart's was not the place to eat that night and left.  He begged us not to leave as we walked out and said that we could use all of the tables if we wanted, but why stay at a place that obviously doesn't want your business?  This particular bartender lost out on a big check and nice tip for his waitress.  I will never dine here again.  Therefore, 1 star."}
{"text":"We went to the Southside location on Friday to use our Living Social coupon.  The place is a few doors down from Local on Carson Street.  The atmosphere is pretty cool.  We started with a few beers from a pretty extensive menu.  Our waiter Carl rocked!  When I knocked over my draft, Carl was over in seconds to help.  We started with chili cheese fries which were more than enough to share.  The chili was good.  I plan on sampling a bowl soon.  We both had burgers and they were very very good.  Cooked perfectly and very tasty.  I'd put this in the same category as BRG.   Since it is closer to us than BRG and Burgatory we'll be back to see ol Carl whenever we are in the mood for a good burger.  (I did not get to sample any whiskey but it looked like they had a ton to sample)"}
{"text":"We called to get information about something specific on the menu and the person who answered the phone was beyond rude! She said in an annoyed voice 'Ummmm NOOOOOO'.....AND HUNG UP! We will not eat there because of this!!!!"}
{"text":"As the name implies, this is a bar on the southside.  Being as such there is not a plethora of seating, but my party had no problem getting a small table when we showed up Wednesday night.  As I looked at the menu I realized that I had to go for their namesake, so I ordered a Denny Double Bleu Burger, an order of fries, and a Bushmill's on the rocks.  The staff was friendly and accommodating, but the food took a little time to come out from when we ordered.  Oh, but when it did come out I dug in and it was delicious.  The burger was cooked exactly to order, juicy and tender.  The bleu cheese dressing with the crumbles was bleu cheese overkill.  Just the way I like it.  The fries were some of the best fries I've ever had.  They were crispy, yet big enough to have some substance and were seasoned very well.  The only thing I can complain about is the bun.  Don't get me wrong, it's an adequate bun, but it's more bread-like than bun-like.  It has a light and airy texture and I like my burger buns to be a little denser.  All in all, Winghart's was a great little bar to go to for a burger and whiskey and I think that might be what they were going for."}
{"text":"Excellent!  My son and I went to lunch for burgers and had a great meal.  We arrived at 11:40a and there was already a line out the door, but we stuck with it. This place makes, nay creates specialty burgers and wood fired pizzas.  From the fresh ground beef to the house made aioles and sauces everything is excellent.  You order as you enter and we were fortunate to get a couple of stools at the bar, front row seats! We split an order of chili cheese fries that were beyond compare with any I've had before.  The fries weren't just good, they were perfect.  The last fries were still crunchy and warm.  The beef burger was great and you can even swap the beef for chicken or veggie, although I don't know why. We also has the privilege to sit in front of Shipwreck, the captain of the orders.  He loves what he is doing and does it very well.  One of the burgers is named for him.  Great place, great people, superb food!"}
{"text":"So after checking out a few of the joints in Pittsburgh, I was craving a nice juicy burger with some fries. After just a little bit of searching, I stumbled upon this joint on yelp and decided to walk over on a Sunday evening. The setup is in Market Square itself and is tucked into the corner between starbucks and primanti brothers. There are two floors with the bottom floor being a view of the kitchen whiles the top floor having the full blown bar. I of course made my way to the top floor and sat down at the bar next to the tv. These guys actually have a pretty solid collection of hard alcohol which I was impressed with along with hosting a few different types of Japanese whiskey which was also a nice plus. The bartenders upstairs are pretty chill and friendly providing quick service and good conversation.   I have been here twice now and have ordered the shipwreck, the market sq burger, and the Cajun fries. The fries are solid so if you are here with a group (or by yourself *guilty face) then definitely order some fries. If you like cheese, ask them to top it off with beer cheese and they will gladly accommodate. The shipwreck is loaded with brie cheese, bacon and white truffle aioli while the market square burger is loaded with mushrooms, gruyere cheese, bacon, and a honey mustard sauce. The meat is juicy and my particular orders had good flavor to them. The shipwreck was solid but I did think the truffle aioli went a bit over the top with the way they loaded it on. Still obviously didn't stop me from eating all of it and it wont for you either. The market square burger was solid with the gruyere cheese being perfect complimented with the honey mustard.   I am a fan of the place and will be back whenever im searching for some burgers/fries and a good selection of whiskey"}
{"text":"We have been to the Southside Winghart's and never left disappointed, so it was only a matter of time before we ventured to the original location being that we live in the city limits and are always looking to explore.    Even though our order did not change much, we left equally as satisfied as we had been on previous visits to the E Carson location.  The service here was also great.  Our waitress was quick, attentive, and kind.    This locations seems a lot smaller, and you can actually physically see them cooking (especially if you sit at the bar which is where the majority of the seats are).    Hands down, the best quick joint in Market Square."}
{"text":"Yum Yum in my Tum Tum ...for the most part.  I always seem to be asking my co-workers at work \"can we order food!?\" and for the not first but second time we decided to get Winghart's!  If it wasn't for me meeting Shipwreck(the owner) himself while having a drinky drink over at Sienna(uh-MAZING btw)  I probably would've steered clear of Winghart's all together.   Anywho my first visit or to-go order rather was their Hula Burger ordered Medium Rare(should've went Medium Well) was tasty! As messy as this burger appeared outside of its wrapper it was pretty good. Sweet and Tangy in all the right ways.   My second to-go ordered happened today as I write this review for you now. I couldn't decided between the Colin Orangutan or the I Don't Care, Whatever Burger. I think I made the right choice this time with the IDCWB. OMG Sex in my mouth. The toppings for this burger are on point. Pepperjack, Bleu Cheese, Cheddar, Jalapenos, Pepperonicinis, Onions, Hot Sauce, Bacon, um yeah. Hell yeah. I licked all the sauce off my fingers.  GET. IT. NOW. OR. ELSE."}
{"text":"In a word... YUM.   Great service, they had Crispin cider on draft, the food was YUMMO and it was just a great experience overall exceeding our expectations.    I got the chili and the margarita pizza and my husband got the Shipwreck burger and fries.... I highly would recommend any of the above.    Keep up the awesome work, Winghart's!  It is nice having you in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"My partner and I stopped here after reading all the reviews and craving a burger.  It was average.  Place was cool, so was the staff.    I like my burgers medium or medium rare.  Mine came out medium well.  I think I've been spoiled living in CA and VT.  I'm convinced those two states literally serve the best burgers in the nation."}
{"text":"I will admit my yelp folowers that this was more of a tipsy food stop but non the less I do remember it being delicious. This is a whiskey bar and while I myself am not a big whiskey fan I was with three guys who really the huge whiskey selections. I had a pumpkin cidar that was amazing! As for the food I enjoyed the beer cheese fries. The sauce was tasty and the homemade fries were cooked to perfection. We also ordered the buffalo chicken sandwhich. This is where I was a tad disappointed. I thought it would be fried but it was more a chicken burger. I was told Ibhad the option of a chicken breast but probably in my tipsy state missed that option. The waitress was very kind and knowledgeable and even saved my from a drink I probably would have disliked. Quick service. Great service and the kitchen is open until 2!"}
{"text":"This place was a quick stop on our way past the mall.  It seemed like an okay place but for 5 o'clock on a wednesday, it wasn't busy.  The food was good but my only complaint about the food is when I ordered a pork bbq sandwich, I thought it would be like pulled pork.  Instead, it was a pork patty and was average tasting.  Not horrible, just nothing really amazing."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in the Pittsburgh area.  On the level of Tessaros and Burgatory.  Got the shipwrecked burger.  Flavor was wonderful and it was cooked to a perfect medium rare."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write this for a while.  I was in Pittsburg back in March for an Engineering conference. The first day, after a full day of flying from California running on almost no food, the group that I traveled with were very hungry. Walking around downtown Pittsburg we came across Winghart's Burgers. Our group was relatively large, but the staff was really nice and still seated us. Our group couldn't all sit together, but that was fine.   The waitresses and cooks were extremely friendly! This definitely wasn't California haha. One of the waitresses sat down with us and told us about the menu, and how their ground beef was never frozen nor microwaved. I ordered a double patty one pound burger (it was huge!!). After we ordered and while we waited for food the waitress super friendly and continued to chat with us about the town, since we were new. And we talked about California as well.   We got the food. First, the fries were really good! They were fresh cut, seasoned well and tasted great! next was the burger. The fresh burger was awesome! They say it was never frozen, and I think that definitely put it as one of the top burgers I've ever eaten. If I ever make it back to Pittsburg (PA, not CA), Winghart's Burgers will definitely see me again!"}
{"text":"Came back for round 2 to sample the Burger and I can tell you it was a very good burger but it wasn't the best and far from the worse! I wasn't impressed with the cole slaw which was just bland with no distinction! Had another sample of some Black N Blue wings and they were good but not great. I would recommend and return for sure."}
{"text":"Greasy food, dirty, & dingy atmosphere. Their \"Sweet Georgia's\" was nothing special at all. I've had way better. I was very disappointed after seeing all these good reviews on Yelp. To make matters worse, I saw all the oil and dirt on the counter tops while eating and all the violation of health codes around the cooking materials and floors. Took a bite and left. On the way out, the waitress told us it was her fave pizza. I suddenly felt sorry for her. She obviously has not traveled outside of Pittsburgh nor tasted what a real good pizza is."}
{"text":"I had the shipwreck burger and wings. They were the best. The service was wonderful. Very friendly."}
{"text":"Waste of time and money. This place must be a front as it doesn't come off as a legit restaurant. So many better burger and beer joints on Carson, don't bother with this place. Google for yourself their problems with the PLCB."}
{"text":"I'm going to preface my review with this...I don't like burgers (veggie or otherwise).  I've heard great things about Wingharts so I took some coworkers down here for lunch knowing I would be ordering a pizza.  We tried to go early because I've heard it gets really busy at lunch.  Unfortunately, the line at 11:45 was about 10 people longer than the line at noon.    I also didn't realize that they have almsot zero seating except a few small tables at the back and the bar seating.  We didn't want to sit at the bar because of the long line that wraps around right behind you, so we opted for our food to go.  The place definitely has a Primanti's type feel to it.  Wait in line, order at the bar, crowded, limited to no seating at lunchtime.  I'll do takeout next time I go.  I went with the Tatonka Chicken Pizza.  Good but not great.  I loved the chicken sausage on it which had a great bite but it needed more chicken on it.  Some of my slices didn't get any chicken!  My other gripe about the pizza was that it was a little on the salty side.  I think it was a result of the blue cheese being very salty but who knows.  My coworkers both ordered the Sweet Georgia Brown but when we got back to work, we discovered that one of their pizzas was missing the barbeque chicken.  Oops.    Overall, a little bit of a letdown given the rave reviews on yelp and personal accounts from friends but I'll be back."}
{"text":"After months of searching for a late-night dining options last summer, my co-workers and I happened into Winghart's after a long shift. Finding a kitchen that serves after 11PM in Pittsburgh is a rarity, let alone on a Sunday night. We took advantage of the outdoor seating and were quickly greeted by our server, who was personable without being overbearing. The whiskey aficionado of our group was impressed by the extensive selection of offerings, and there were several beer and cocktail options that appealed to the rest of us right off the bat. The decision was made to divide and conquer on the food front, which ended up being a great strategy. We were absolutely blown away by the quality of the food, which makes sense since everything is made from scratch. The Shipwreck Burger is, hands-down, the best burger I've ever had and the O.G. Mac is now my roommate's go-to option for comfort food. Portion sizes are large without being overwhelming, and we've never experienced less than stellar service from any of the employees; it's quickly become our favorite late-night spot.  Working in the service industry, I am constantly on the look-out for places to recommend to guests coming into town; my co-workers and I send people to Winghart's throughout the week and are always regaled with stories of an all-around fantastic dining and/or drinking experience. It's a wonderful testament to the work ethic of this locally owned and operated business to maintain a loyal customer base while attracting new fans in a town where restaurants come and go in the blink of an eye. Keep up the excellent work!"}
{"text":"Again, I reiterate there aren't many places to go to before 11am for brunch or cocktails in the fine city of Pittsburgh. Which, unfortunately was exactly what we wanted at around 10am on a Friday. We finally trudged around and noticed that Winghart's was open at 11am and went upstairs knowing we only wanted cocktails after eating crumby bagels at Au Bon. We were the first ones there. I am not ashamed in the slightest after we jokingly laughed and said we wanted brunch and couldn't find it.   This place though isn't anything fancy but they do serve up some mean fancy whiskey cocktails! A few martinis and vodka fruity things to boot but this is definitely a whiskey bar as advertised. I can't remember the name of my cocktail but it involved copious amounts of Knob Creek, a little simple syrup, lemonade mixer and a squirt of soda water. My sister stuck with a whiskey, orange juice, grapefruit concoction and it was delicious. We were both set with perfect morning cocktails. In the background they had 16 Candles playing and the bartender was pretty friendly and jovial. The prices of drinks? Kind of meh. They were $9 or $10 a bit more than I expected for Pittsburgh about right I expect for New York. But I wasn't disappointed. They apparently serve a wide range of burgers, pizzas, and salads that we didn't take advantage of. But the Shipwreck with brie, caramelized onions, arugula, bacon and white truffle oil sounds pretty out of this world. There are also burgers with fries on them, which I'm not shocked by at all. There isn't anything much better than burgers and bourbon on a Friday morning and not being at work. So this place gets two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Winghart's is a welcome player in the ever-growing game of upscale burger joints.  While I have had some awesome burgers at other restaurants around the city that don't necessarily specialize in burgers (Tessaro's in Bloomfield, Remedy in Lawrenceville, and Six Penn in the Cultural District- try them all!), Winghart's is definitely the winner among those that claim fame in burger making.  My boyfriend and I came to the South Side location after a botched attempt to go to the Market Square one which is currently under renovations and I am so happy we made the extra little jaunt to the South Side instead of letting our hungry stomachs take us astray somewhere else downtown.  I tried the Shipwreck burger after reading many of the previous reviews on here and it did not disappoint! Gooey brie all mixed up with caramelized onions, bacon, arugula, and white truffle aioli (hooray for fancy mayo!) to compliment a GIANT beef patty on the perfect bun.  I was honestly so preoccupied with my own massive feast that I don't remember what exactly my boyfriend got but i tried a bite of it and it was cheesy, delicious, and spicy.    Pro's:  - Awesome creative burger combinations served in a plastic wrapper to keep it all from becoming a giant mess while you eat it - Great fries to boot (a necessary combo with any burger) - Great draft and liquor selection - Friendly staff  Con's: - Place was not crowded and took a LONG time for our food to come out - Ordered my burger medium and it came out well-done (saved because it was still juicy, but I like my cows still mooing! Will have to remember to opt for medium rare next time) - Tables at the front of the restaurant are not good for eating they are super skinny and long... and there are not many tables in the back.  We sat at the bar which was fine because it was not crowded on a Wednesday night but could have been annoying on a busier weekend"}
{"text":"This place is for suckers.  So unbelievably overprices for incredibly surly service, tiny little drinks, and okay food.  I seriously don't know who this place thinks it is, but it is not worth what they are charging.  You want to spend $65 on a night with two burgers, two beers, and two well drinks?  Go to FATHEADS.  Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Note: This review is for the pizza (and mac and cheese!), since I'm not a (beef) burger eater.  I came here in April with several friends before seeing a musical at the Byham.  None of us had been here before, but we came here based on the convenience and the good reviews.  I ordered the sweet Georgia Brown pizza, which has BBQ chicken, pineapple, red onion, and cheddar cheese.  It had an interesting sweet-savory flavor profile, and a nice crispy texture.  It was pretty good, as pizzas go, and definitely an interesting departure from typical pizza fare.  I recommend it.  One of my friends ordered the shipwrecked burger, and found it delicious, if a bit over-the-top fatty.  Another of my friends ordered the macaroni and cheese, per the waitress's recommendation, so I had to try it, as the resident mac and cheese connoisseur.  I wasn't expecting to be impressed, but the sauce, which was on the milder side, was surprisingly creamy and well-seasoned, and complemented the tenderness of the shell pasta nicely (score: 9.0).  If you go there, try it--this has to be the dark horse of mac and cheeses in PGH!  The atmosphere of this place is dark and kind of cave-like, with weird decor.  Like another reviewer, between the place's logo, the decor, and the waitress's \"uniform,\" I felt that it came off as trying a bit too hard to be hipster.  It definitely has character--though I don't know if it's quite the right type.  Service was fine--no problems there.  Overall, an interesting place worth trying if you happen to be downtown."}
{"text":"food is awesome. but some drunk or just crazy dude was yelling at the air and making me very uncomfortable. if this was my first time, i would have been turned off on the service staff lack of action. the server didn't even ask how my meal was when i was done, almost as if she knew the answer and didn't want to hear it.  i'll be back i'm sure, i work downtown, but this last experience was not the best."}
{"text":"I stopped by this Winghart's with a couple of friends this past Sun. at around 6:30.  Having visited and enjoyed the original location in Market Square, and having a City Dining Card, I suggested that we stop by.  Since it'd been awhile since my friends had had a good burger, they were game, so we ventured over to E. Carson St. to check it out.  As an appetizer, we ordered the white truffle aioli fries ($5.25) to share between us.  These fries were well-fried and crispy, and the toppings were delicious, taking the fries to another level.  As my entree, I decided to go with the French mac and cheese ($12.50), since I'd never tried Boursin cheese before.  This dish, which is listed as an appetizer, also included crimini mushrooms and bacon, and turned out to be more than large enough for me as an entree.  I really enjoyed its flavor, which was creamy and complemented well by savory notes from the bacon and mushrooms.  My friends ordered the shipwreck ($10.50) and Market Square ($11) burgers.  They enjoyed them, but I can't comment on them because I didn't try them due to not eating beef.  Our visit initially got off to an awkward start when nobody greeted us when upon arrival--we had to approach the bar to get seated, and menus weren't brought over for another ~10 min.  However, once our waiter became aware of our presence, all went smoothly.  The atmosphere is very bar-like, similar to the Market Square location.  While good quality, esp. for a bar, I find the food to be a tad overpriced--fortunately, though, I had a City Dining Card, which knocked $10 off of our check.  Overall, this Winghart's is pretty comparable to the one downtown, so if you enjoy that one, you should enjoy this one as well."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight, and first and foremost, my waitress was FANTASTIC! I regret not getting her name so that I could call her out for her great service.  We got pierogis, and they were pretty solid. We also got two burgers, the shipwreck and the jefferson's something or other. The shipwreck was apparently fantastic, while the Jefferson thing was just okay. To be fair the waitress didn't recommend it, but I went with it anyways.  We also split a white truffle aioli fries, which wee very good.  Good food, GREAT staff. It's a bit pricy for basic American food, but with coming to it"}
{"text":"Our hotel directed to this place for good local brews and a burger! The local brews are very tasty. I had a mango wheat which was yummy! The black n bleu wings could've had some more kick! Our burgers were pretty good, not the best but good. The fries were 5 star!! Definitely a cool vibe with great service. We will be back to try the pizza!!"}
{"text":"The last time I was at this restaurant was in early 2013 at the East Carson St. location and I ordered the Shipwreck burger because it sounded so delicious. Delicious is an understatement. Ever since then I would still think and dream over that burger and talk about it with other people who probably didn't care about a burger they couldn't try for themselves.  A few weeks ago this burger and I had a rapturous though short-lived reunion at the downtown location. I probably didn't pay attention back in 2013 but apparently now Winghart's is also known for its pizza, but I didn't get any this time. I always thought it was known for their handmade burger patties...but maybe it's because I was so smitten with this one it didn't matter what the other menu items were....  Anyway the only reason I'm leaving off 1 star (though perhaps it should be just half of a star off) is that service happened to be slow on this Friday afternoon when I went, but the staff were courteous and attentive when they could be. Maybe I'll change my mind later and just give it the full 5...."}
{"text":"Alright, Burgatory/BRGR/every other trendy gourmet burger establishment that has popped up in Pittsburgh within the past year--it's time to start trying harder. Or maybe, stop trying, because it might be impossible to reach the level of delicious that is Winghart's.  Maybe I'm exaggerating...am I? The burger I had here was most definitely in the top five burgers ever eaten in my life, and THE best in Pittsburgh, though to be fair I'm semi-new to the area and have yet to try Tessaro's. I had the Shipwreck burger: Bacon. Brie. Carmelized Onions. Arugula. Truffle Aioli. TRUFFLE AIOLI--I didn't care what else was on the burger, if I hear \"truffles,\" I'm there. Even though I don't generally like onions, I decided on this rare occassion I would trust Mr. Shipwreck and just order it as-is instead of my usual laundry list of additions and omissions.  Of course I was excited, but I was also a bit nervous. Every one of the toppings has an intense flavor that can easily overpower. But by some miracle, it not only worked, it was perfection, with a complexity that you just have to eat to understand. The burger itself was not quite as red as I prefer, but it was so juicy that it actually didn't matter. Oh, and it's about twice the size of BRGR's pathetically portioned patty. I'm totally in love.  Negatives:  1. Location. I don't go downtown unless I absolutely have to because of obvious transportational issues. Plus, it's not exactly the most happenin' neigborhood in town. UPDATE: Problem solved, there's now a second location on the Southside!  2. The signage. Ed Hardy called, and he wants his logo back. But hey, it's marginally better than BRGR's (no excuse for using Papyrus on anything other than the title page for a 9th grade essay on Ancient Egypt). So, keep rockin' it out Winghart's...that awkward heart tattoo won't stop me from enjoying your obscenely good burgers!"}
{"text":"The new location is just as good as the old one! Except more convenient for me!  When I ordered my burger rare I got the \"Just so you know, our rare burgers are ACTUALLY rare, so they're basically raw meat\" warning, which is the best. I also ordered the Shipwreck burger, like always, which is also the best. I kind of want to try a different one next time but I know I never will because the Shipwreck burger is like, the best burger of all time. There's a reason everyone talks it up so much...because it's good as hell. No overratedness here whatsoever.  For your first visit, let me make things simple: Rare Shipwreck + Beer cheese fries. And a few good beers. Do it!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem.  A buddy and I found this place on Yelp and liked how it was rated.  Surrounded by other larger and brighter restaurants in Market Square, I'm not sure we would have stopped in on our own but glad we did.  The first day we went we sat downstairs at the bar where we watched the food being prepared.  It was fun to interact with the cooks and staff as we waited for our meals.  We ordered the mojo fries, OG mac and cheese and a couple burgers to split.  The mac was outstanding.  The pasta was perfectly cooked.  The fries were fresh, well seasoned and perfectly cooked.    I ordered the \"I don't care whatever\" burger.  I had a slight misunderstanding with the waitress about how I wanted it cooked but she quickly resolved the issue and the cooks quickly made me a new burger.  All I can say is it's one of the best burgers I have ever had.  The meat was fresh and cooked perferctly.  The toppings we're diced small which lends to the eating experience; I got a mix of everything in each bite.  The had a good selection of craft beers.    After dinner we went upstairs and ordered a drink at the bar.  I wouldn't exactly call it a full bar but they do have a great selection of burbons and scotch.  They seem to specialize in Manhattens and Old Fashioneds.  I ordered Blanton's burbon on the rocks.  The bartender realized he didn't have enough so rather than giving me a weak pour, he gave me Four Roses Single Barrel at the lower Blanton's price!  Great customer service.  We loved this place so much we went back two nights later this time sitting upstairs.  We ordered the beer cheese fries which were great.  The beer cheese wasn't overly cheesey, it had a slight gravy flavor.  We also ordered the blue cheese and garlic mac and cheese.  If I were to be super picky this is where I would have my only complaint.  I expected more fresh garlic and the blue cheese they use is very mild and didn't really stand out from the regular cheese sauce.  I'm not sure it was worth the extra 5 or 6 dollars over the regular mac and cheese.  That being said it was still quality and tasted great.  I ordered the same burger I had before.  I don't give 5 stars easily but this place deserves it.  Anything this place lacks in size and space it more than makes up for in armosphere, food and customer service."}
{"text":"Service was fine, however the food might be the worst I have ever had. Maybe they were having an off night but I have never tasted a more awful burger. It tasted like it was soaked in kerosene. I couldn't even eat the burger and the fries were served to us basically black - they were extremely burnt I am shocked to see someone even serve something like that. My friend also ordered a burger medium rare and it came out more than rare. I think the center was actually still cold. The macaroni and cheese was okay, but sadly that is the only positive thing I have to say about this place. Don't think I'll ever be returning."}
{"text":"A+ for the food. The Shipwreck burger, the market square burger, the pizza. All good stuff.   F for the service. I love it how the one dude in the back is screaming out yeah good job, hey keep up the good work, lets keep it up, yet theres customers confused as no one has taken an order or told them where to sit. A little chaotic at best.  They need a hostess to sit people its that simple. Get a hostess, have them sit people and that way people aren't forced to use the to go line to get food. Half the time customers are sent into the vast darkness to look for a seat only to return because theyre all taken then need to step back in line to get it to go.  My main concern is the rule you can't eat our food here if you get to go. Go to Chipotle, get yours to go, sit down eat half the burrito, pack the rest for a snack or dinner later. They give you an abundance of food so you know you'll have leftovers.  Go to wingharts order to go (after the waitress acknoledges you exist), wait 15 minutes for your food, and sit down and watch the manager yell at you! No i swear even the people at the bar looked at him like what the **** do you mean you need to leave. Apparently the bar stools ( about a dozen) were empty and when we sat down he told us to leave the restaurant while we tried to eat their food! It is reserved for the people who ordered sit in and not to go! We would've sat down if all your chairs weren't full 45 minutes ago when we first walked in!   I'm just saying, burgatory is where it's at. I would've given it a higher rating if it wasn't for the dumb manager on duty. I guess the old customer is always right rule doesn't apply here. Or common sense."}
{"text":"It seems that pretty much all the food they serve here are decent, but from their menu I got the sense that their burgers were the main draw. That, in addition to hearing from many people that the burgers here are some of the best in Pittsburgh. They have a pretty good list of different burger creations, as well as a customizable option. It was also nice that they're willing to do substitutions (for example, beef patty instead of chicken sausage that one comes with). While they don't come with fries, most are pretty inexpensive, some being just under $10. I got the Market Square burger and it was juicy and flavorful. Not only did I appreciate that they chopped up the tomatoes, onions, and pickles (instead of giving me huge slices of each), but I was pleasantly surprised by how well most of the burger stayed intact while I was eating it. Great feature!"}
{"text":"Great place for food and drinks downtown. There is a well know local brothers sandwhich shop next door, don't bother going to it. Head over to Wingharts instead. You won't be disappointed. Friendly service and heavy handed on the booze!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and neither time was good. The service is slow, and disorganized. I once ordered takeout, showed up twenty minutes later as instructed, then stood and waited fifteen minutes for my order    The food is okay but overpriced. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"With a name like Wingharts, I expected more wings.  They do have them, but it seems like they are just a part of the menu instead of being front and center.  We grabbed a couple beers at the bar.  It's a pretty long bar going front to back with tables before and after it.  There are plenty of tvs, but it seems more of a hipster bar than a sports bar.  The food sounded pretty good from the menu, so I ordered a chicken sandwich and the beer cheese fries.    The sandwich was ok, it was the Pretty Good Chicken Sandwich with the chicken breast.  It's your basic sandwich with greens, onions, tomatoes, provolone and a red pepper aioli.  It's served on a regular burger bun.  The beer cheese fries were nothing special.  The beer cheese was bland and the fries were like salt bombs.  The bartender was very attentive though and kept our drinks filled."}
{"text":"I came in and sat down to look at the menu, and started chatting with the chef like it was a sushi bar. Turns out I was talking to none other than Shipwreck himself, so his recommendation was fairly obvious. We got a shipwreck, a falafel burger, an order of fries, and a side of cole slaw - I have to try the cole slaw everywhere I go... I almost never like it as much as I hope, but I've gotta know. Blame my inner yinzer.  The food was quick and the wait staff was super nice, they joked around with us, and even though this place orders like a fast food joint(Order at the counter, sit down and you'll get served), the girls come around, refill your drinks, clean up after you, etc. I ran into service like this at Los Cabos, as well and I have to say, I don't like paying - more specifically tipping - before I get my food. Not that I would tip any more or less unless the service was amazing or awful, but it just seems to go against the spirit - more like I'm trying to please the establishment that will be handling my food prep with a number than the other way around.  Anyways, that was just an aside - I really loved the fries, some of them were super crispy, it's hard to find them like that in a lot of places but I love them. The burgers came exactly as we asked for them and they were well presented and covered in toppings. Amazing that they make it all the way to the counter neatly stacked, as they seem to get messy instantly upon picking them up. Well the Shipwreck did, anyways.   The coleslaw was good. I like it a little creamier but it beats Primanti's(as if that's hard to do).. I could definitely eat it, instead of taking a bite and wishing I had grabbed something else.  I didn't try the falafel, unfortunately, I was way too stuffed from trying to eat every last fry(I failed), and it seemed really heavy(I mean it's a giant wad of solid chickpea mass), so half of that remains in our fridge for round two.  I spoke with Shipwreck a bit more about the place, he said the liquor should flow within a few weeks. I caught a meeting with Victory brewing company(thanks for the golden monkey sample a few nights ago, Victory lady!), so expect them on tap(not to divulge any trade secrets!)  Overall, I like this place, and I will like it more when I can grab a drink here. I think the atmosphere is spot on and the people are definitely friendly enough to hang out with, with or without a burger in hand. The pizzas looked good, so that will probably on my list next time.  Unfortunately, the burger has yet to beat out my favorite, Kuma's Corner in Chicago, but I'll take this on a regular basis to Kuma's less than once a year."}
{"text":"Holy moley. A friend and I decided to come here on a whim after seeing the Book of Mormon. Being around 11pm, it was pretty late for Pittsburgh, and we didn't feel like paying an arm and a leg to go eat at some of the nicer (but still super delicious!) places Downtown. Deciding to try Winghart's was one of my best decisions ever.  I saw on my Yelp app that this place has decent reviews, but now I know they don't fully encapsulate the awesomeness of this place. We walked in and asked to sit to eat, and even though they were considering closing the kitchen early, they fired everything up for us as needed, with zero resentment and constant friendliness.  We sat at a bar open to the grill area, so we watched all of our food being made in front of us. The fries were unbelievable, and my burger was cooked to true medium-rare perfection. It was actually a little rarer than I would normally order it most other places, but the meat was such melt-in-your-mouth quality goodness that I had no qualms and just chowed down. My friend's \"burger\" was a chicken sausage patty, and it was also fantastic (but obviously fully-cooked).  (Almost) Even better than the food were the people there. Our cook was a huge yinzer, and told some pretty entertaining stories as we ate. Definitely not for kids, but I don't know why you'd be out with your kids at 11pm on a Wednesday.  This is the kind of place where I feel like you'd always wind up in conversation with someone, be it the people who work there or the guy eating a burger next to you at the bar. Winghart's makes me want to hang out in Downtown more, since I know I'll have an awesome meal waiting for me at some point during the night."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had! Staff is very personable. I'll definitely return and recommend this place."}
{"text":"After seeing the positive reviews I really expected more. I am only commenting on the food, which was mediocre at best.  Not sure if the fries were meant to be like that but they were just burnt. My \"I dont care, whatever\" burger was ok, definitely not an $11 plus burger though. At least it should have came with a side.  For those of you who are amazed by the burgers here please give yourself a favor and try Sauce in Bridgeville and you will thank me."}
{"text":"Wow, so glad that we stopped in for lunch based on the reviews.  My son and I had what we both describe as \"the best burger we have ever had.\". The meat is what makes it great. It tastes very fresh.  Then they put it on a nice toasted bun.  I am salivating just thinking about it.  My husband got a pizza and he loved it.  We don't live in the area, but if we ever make it back we will definitely stop by for a great burger!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the appeal is - poor service that is slow, kitchen ran out of chicken (how does that happen?) and expensive for what it is ... $10 for a veggie burger? Is this a joke? ...   Truffle oil aoili fries seemed redeeming till I saw that the plate was full of \"bottom of the bag\" small pieces. Guess no one showed the yuppie restaurants that you mix the bottom of the bag of the old fries with the new bag so a customer doesn't feel jipped.   Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Very yummy. 2nd time here and have enjoyed it both times. Had the wings (8 to a plate) but with options to have two sauces. Also tried the \"I don't care whatever\" burger and it was spicy. Get ready for the burn if you ask for this one! The best of our order was the pizza - tatonka pizza. Wow! Just wow! Would order it again."}
{"text":"The food is incomparable. The wings are the meatiest and tastiest, the pizza is heavenly and the drinks are amazing. The time and work put into them is unrivaled by other south side establishment. I highly recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"So we wet to this winghart's after trying the one in Greensburg, It is night an day.  The one in Greensurg was terrible. The one in Monroeville was 100 times better. The staff is fantastic. They are friendly, courteous and will do anything they can to make your visit a pleasant one. We had a few of the new drinks including the pink panther and the blue popsicle and they were yummy and a fair price. Our food was good yet a bit salty. It's a nice place to relax with friends shoot some pool or darts and have a few drinks after diner. It would be neat to have some more adult type games like corn hole or other things such as that. We will defiantly make the 30 min drive from Greensburg just to go to this one. I like the low lighting, but the \"paintings\" on the walls are quite interesting. I think a little better décor could go a long way."}
{"text":"So delicious! Good vibes, cool decor, and awesome food. Will be back if ever in Pittsburgh again!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, two of three items were wrong when delivered.  I tried many times to call the restaurant with the number provided, but the calls were not answered.  I will not b ordering from here again, which is a shame as the now closed Oakland location used to be a favorite haunt of mine."}
{"text":"Was told this was the \"Best burger in Pittsburgh\". I didn't try any other Pittsburgh burgers, but I must say this place did not disappoint. Was looking for a place for a beer and burger after a Pirates game, and ended up here. I was skeptical about the \"Dockworker\" burger with provolone and cole slaw, but it was outstanding! Perfectly cooked. And the fries were amazing as well. Exceptional service too. We will be back next time we're in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Wingharts is definitely different. Am I glad I checked it out? Sure. Would I make a point to stop by again? Likely not. The atmosphere upstairs (read: bar) was eclectic and fun, yet super tight with not a lot of seating. We were there on a Monday afternoon and were hoping for a quick taste of Pittsburgh. We ordered pierogies (one of my favorite things on earth) Grampa style (caramalized onions and bacon) and requested a side of sour cream. They came out without the sour cream and after asking for it twice, we gave up. It didn't come up in conversation again until the bill came and we were charged for it. They kindly removed it without hassle, but I was still a little annoyed. I don't get back East very often, so I was hoping to have them how I wanted them.  We also added the white truffle aioli french fries to our \"healthy\" lunch. They were, hands down, the best part of our entire experience. YUM!  For the entree, we ordered a Dockworker burger. It's a bit like Primanti Bro's with french fries and cole slaw. I learned if I want something like Primanti Bro's, I should go TO PB. It was HORRIBLE. I'm not sure what it was about it, but I took one bite and couldn't eat another. I don't typically eat this type of fare (bar food or the like) so that could've been it, but I definitely don't recommend that burger.   If I were to go back, I'd likely order a pizza as those looked better than anything else I saw come out."}
{"text":"Popeyes salad and pineapple cider were both excellent.  Staff was very nice.  Would definitely eat here again. My friends each got a burger and fries and liked them too."}
{"text":"Ok, I've given this place 3 attempts, and very time I've left feeling kinda meh about the place. Granted, I've bar gotten a burger, so take my review wih that grain of salt...  My most recent visit, we got wings, my husband a burger ( which he did say he liked...) and I got cheese fries (wings and cheese fries, dinner of champions!) The wings were good, once we sent them back to have them actually tossed in buffalo sauce, though these was something subtly weird tasting about the buffalo sauce....not enough to preclude my enjoyment of them.  They were crispy, just like I like'em!  The cheese fries were awful. The cheese was bad, and the fries were (burnt, overdone, weird tasting) worse! I ate a couple and had to convince my husband to let me eat more than my fair share of the wings so I didn't go hungry.   I'll go back, I'm sure, but with low expectations and a mental note to never order the fries."}
{"text":"I stopped by here yesterday afternoon with my BF while we were waiting for the airport bus. I got the Collin's Orangutan burger - chicken patty, green apple, caramelized onions, gouda, and bacon. The chicken itself was super juicy, which was a nice surprise, and all of the other components complemented each other really well. My boyfriend got the Matolla bacon cheeseburger and that was also delicious.  The cocktails were a little more hit or miss. I wouldn't recommend the strawberry moonshine/iced tea drink (it may have been called the pink lady?) - the taste was just off plus it wasn't cold. I liked the bourbon-lemon cocktail though.  Service was fine. I probably wouldn't bring my parents but I would def recommend it to anyone with a burger craving!"}
{"text":"From Fat Burger to White Castle - Wingharts's burgers take it above and beyond what a great burger can be - cooked perfectly just as we asked - freshest ingredients, soft delicious bun.  Their fresh cut fries were crispy not limp like other places tend to do with fresh cut potatoes-  AMAZING!"}
{"text":"After an 8 hr bus ride and a walk around the point we hit the wing hart.  Totally worth it. The staff was helping and extremely pleasant.  The food was killer and the prices were extremely fair.  I'd go again and would recommend highly.  I had the dockworker and it was great.  The slaw was banging."}
{"text":"Best veggie burger around. The staff was very sociable and welcoming. The guy on the grill was awesome - got all of the temps dead on. I only give it four because  seating is tight and they do not take reservations."}
{"text":"Winghart's is a great (somewhat) new restaurant in Market Square with excellent burgers and fries.  My favorite is the Shipwreck Burger (cool name, cool guy) and their fries.  Great beer and whiskey selection as-well.  This restaurant was hugely popular during the lunch rush over the summer and caused me to unfortunately not visit very frequently due to the amount of time required to have lunch.  They've opened some dining space upstairs and appear to be doing a bit better turning meals around in the kitchen.  Hopefully they'll keep improving their speed and this place will become a go-to for a quick (and delicious) lunch.  Recommend the Shipwreck burger, the Pittsburgh salad with chicken patty, or the Winghart-attach pizza.    Good stuff."}
{"text":"Shipwrecked is the burger to get. It's the best in the Burgh. They have a good craft beer list and of course some killer whiskeys.  Sit at the bar and talk with the chefs. Not to mention the free smells."}
{"text":"A new favorite spot! The staff is so friendly and fun to chat with - burgers are delicious and sure to please any burger lover. I was especially impressed with their micro brew selections - don't be afraid to ask for samples! Decent wet bar selections with an unbelievable selection if whiskers....well duh! Ha. My friend is more of a whiskey drinker and was impressed with the choices. Great place to hit after ice skating and during the winter months."}
{"text":"Winghart's has been on my to-try list since the Market Square location opened. When I started working in the South Side, I was thrilled to discover this new location, and I finally got to try it last night.  The atmosphere was pretty great; casual and not too crowded. The tables are still really close together (not having been to the M2 location, I can't compare) at the front, where the smaller tables for two are located. The larger tables at the back have a bit more space. It's seat yourself when you walk in; we arrived around 5:15pm on a Friday and there were plenty of seats available. Just FYI: The very first table next to the front door has an AC vent pointed right at it; great if you're hot, not if you don't want a cool breeze on ya! The music is pretty loud, but not so loud we couldn't talk... and it IS a bar, so. Plus, the tunes were good (Bowie!), so I wasn't complaining.  Our server was extremely friendly and checked in right away as I waited for my friend to arrive. I ordered an Ace Pear Cider on draft, which really hit the spot. My friend is super picky about drinks and doesn't want her alcohol to taste like alcohol, so the server helped her find something she'd like. Initially my friend ordered an Amaretto and Coke, but they didn't have amaretto. Before we left, they went and got a bottle so she was able to have the drink she wanted. Pretty impressive, IMO.  We were really there for the food, though. I love a good burger and I couldn't wait to try the Shipwrecked Burger. I ordered mine medium rare, as I always do. My friend got the Tallulah Hula Burger, no onions, medium well (I know). When the burgers arrived, mine was much closer to medium, which may have been a result of waiting around for my friend's medium well. My friend noted that there was some onion residue on her burger (she's really sensitive to the taste) and thinks they may have initially put them on and then scraped them off.  My burger was good, but not omg great. My expectations may have been too high, but it was just... a good burger. The white truffle aioli came through and was delicious; however, the whole thing was really, really salty. And I drink pickle brine, so when I say it was salty, I mean it. The beef flavor didn't really come through. Yes, I know I ordered a burger with a ton of toppings, but at e.g. Tessaro's, even with 900 things on the burger, you can still taste the beef really well.  The fries, to me, were overcooked -- really brown and a little dry, and again, super salty. They did have an intriguing sweetness to them; I'm not sure if it was a brine they were soaked in or just the contrast of potato flavor against all the salt. Didn't love them.  Overall, I'd give the food three stars, and that made me a bit sad. Tessaro's is, IMO, still the best burger in the 'burgh, and I like Burgatory better, too. But the service was definitely five-star, and the atmosphere was nice, hence the overall four-star rating. I didn't try my friend's burger but she ate it all, so she must've liked it fine (after she picked off the remaining onion bits).  I'll go back, because it's convenient to work and it was so nice and relaxed. I'll have another burger, too, since I don't want to render a final judgement based on just one visit."}
{"text":"Great service, good food and friendly bartenders. Burgers were a bit greasy but you kinda expect that walking in to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Small, cozy place but food is good and staff is cool. Although I'm not a big wing eater, they were pretty darn good. There's a variety of flavors but we went with the tikka masala to be different. They tasted even better dipped in ranch. We also had the market square burger and it was really good. The cheese, bacon, and mushrooms were a perfect combination to a very tasty, juicy, beef patty. The o.g. mac n cheese tasted good but was a little too thick for my taste. I felt like I was spackling the inside of my arteries with this stuff. The service was good. They cook everything in front of you at the bar and the cooks looked like they were having fun."}
{"text":"Oh so tasty! I had the Greek pizza. It was wood fire oven-baked goodness chock full of plump, flavorful kalamata olives, big chunks of excellent feta cheese, roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts on a scrumptious thin crust. Fries just as they should be: hand cut and crispy on the outside, yet meaty on the inside. My dining pals had burgers that looked and smelled so good; they were raving over the flavor, freshness and ingredients. I'll have to get one next time.   The quarters are tight (only reason for four, not five stars) but they do plan to open seating upstairs soon. In the summer the entire front opens to outside seating. Everyone on staff seemed to genuinely enjoy preparing our food and they were extremely hospitable. Can't wait to go back, but I'll try a little earlier or a little later than noon, since it gets pretty crowded at lunchtime."}
{"text":"Service was bad. Waitress forgot our drinks. Food was bad. The beer cheese looked and tasted like vomit. Then we couldn't leave because the waitress wouldn't return. Even the beer was bad! I am the least picky eater EVER and I hated the 'Ole Caw'. Waste of calories."}
{"text":"Awesome spot. Great beer on tap. Buffalo wings were tangy and crispy. Burger was awesome, nice and juicy and great toppings. And any bar that's blasting Beastie Boys when you stroll in, is alright. So tasty!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch at the upstairs bar.  The bartender was friendly and attentive.  Very good pierogies (got the bacon and carmelized onion ones).  I think red onions would have added a richer flavor and I wouldn't have buried them in the giant pile of onions, but that was an easy workaround.  My fiance got the Shipwreck burger and loved it (rich flavors and the sour bite he likes).  WISH we had had room to try a funnel cake.  We ate upstairs and could reach a PokéStop that was just outside."}
{"text":"Oh dear nom of all things that are nom!  Gluten free? Yes please!  Aside from having a really good craft beer selection, they have an enormous whiskey selection too. Yes, even Bulleit and Buffalo Trace.   I got the 1lb burger (no bun, I don't eat that no more) and had it cooked rare. This is so far the best rare burger I've had in recent memory! One pound of ground meat smothered in cheese and mushrooms. Hang on, I just drooled on my keyboard...  And then the french fries! If I could drown them in the malt vinegar I would have been even more in heaven. (I can't eat the vinegar ya see? They do have it.) These are those crispy, thin, slightly thicker than shoe-string fries.   I hear the pizza is pretty good too.  The only reason I can't give it a five star rating is the difficult eating space. I'd really suggest showing up early to have a drink or two and then take your burger to go. There's probably like 20 seats total (the majority at the bar) but I have no problem saying I'll go back if someone wants to join me!"}
{"text":"Winghart's is very much a dive bar, but with decent but not over the top food.  Decent burgers, very good macaroni and cheese, average fries.  One thing I will say negative about Winghart's is the ala carte menu.  For the type and quality of the food there along with the price, you really should have fries/chips/something included as a side with a burger.  The other thing to note is that waitresses were very friendly and attentive.  Food was average, but far from bad.  Just if you are picking between here and say Burgatory, head over to the North Shore and get a better burger with fries for the same price.  If you want that \"dive bar\" experience, then Wingharts is your place in Market Square."}
{"text":"The first time I ordered from Winghart's I got take out. I got the 'oly cah burger and it was really good. I didn't have to wait long to get the food and it came with beer cheese, which was really good. The next time I went, I got the Nadalie (I took a picture). It was absolutely delicious. It was messy but it tasted so good. I wish the prices were a bit lower, but overall I like Winghart's. I would eat the Nadalie over and over again."}
{"text":"Shipwreck Burger was dynamite. Big enough to split, if you are not super hungry. Not a lot of seating, if the weather is inclimate."}
{"text":"Ok peeps - I went back and rather than getting a burger, I decided to try the pizza...OMG it is so delicious. I had the Mediterranean pizza and I wasn't expecting much as you can see from my last review, but I was blown away. It was so good, I can't even describe it. I even got it takeout which I thought would make it all soggy - but I must have picked it up at the perfect moment b/c I can't say enough positive things about this pizza.   I'll definitely be back again and this time, I may check out one of their other pizzas. So if your not much of a burger person like me, don't shy away from this place, just choose wisely!"}
{"text":"Awesome Manhattans here. Wings are great and the pizza was good too.   I'd go back just for the Manhattans, but go upstairs for those. I can't speak to the downstairs bar."}
{"text":"That is pretty suspicious that the restaurant has been open 2 weeks and has already gathered 8 other reviews. The first four  reviewers are clearly bogus considering that they only have 1 or two reviews each. How many other restaurants will you find on Yelp with that kind of a distribution? Yeeeaaaah.  Anyway, for a real review, I will say that this place is reasonable, but it a pricey dining option for what you get. If you order a burger, fries are not included. If you order the fries with it, you get like a half pound of them. So, there really should be some in between where you order a burger and fries come with it. It is kind of expected from a burger joint and I find it annoying to order them a-la-carte. I ordered the Hula burger, and it tasted good, but not noticeably different from another burger place that would offer the same item (like Red Robin, for instance). The fries were good, but also, nothing special about them. The total cost was $10.97 including tax, so it is a bit steep for a burger and fry lunch.   I tasted my friend's chicken pizza, and I didn't like it. First it has what appeared to be sausage but was claimed to be chicken (\"chicken sausage\"). The cashier attempted to convince him that it was chicken when he asked about it, but I've never had chicken like that before. Why not just cut to the chase and put sausage on it? Second, it was loaded with bleu cheese which was too strong of a flavor for the pizza. Bleu cheese appears all over the menu, so this must be a favorite ingredient for the owner. Third, its one of those pizzas where you pick it up and the cheese just falls off because the breading folds down.  Getting your food delivered is very speedy and the beef is massed together on site (no pre-made patties), but there is limited seating. Also, they place your burger on a sheet of paper and place it on the counter. My burger was messy and so I kept thinking about the germs soaking through from the table. The menu is also very limited.   Overall, not bad, but clearly not as stellar as these other bogus reviews are trying to convince you of. It's a burger, not some dish that requires a degree from Le Cordon Bleu to prepare.  Appears that all credit cards are accepted here.  Food Quality/Taste = 4 Stars Portion Size Given Price = 3 Stars Price = 2 Stars Service = N/A Experience with Staff = 4 Stars Decor = 2 Stars Clean (yes/no) = yes"}
{"text":"We tried Wingharts for the first time a couple of days ago and loved it!  This was the first time Ive been to any Wingharts location, and I'll definitely be going back.  I got the Dockworker Burger and my husband got the Shipwreck burger (at the suggestion of the Bartender) and we both loved them!  Ive said in one of my previous reviews that I'm not much of a burger fan, which is still true, but when you try a place thats known for their burgers, I feel like you have to at least try one once.. and I was happy I did!  In my opinion, this place takes priority over Primanti's and Sharp Edge.. yes I said it.  The fries are great and I LOVE that everything is fresh and made in house.. seriously an A+ move in my book.    Our Bartender, Rick, was awesome.  He gave us some honest suggestions when we inquired about menu items, and he clearly knew his stuff.  He was super friendly and gave us awesome service.  When we first came in and sat down, he said to us \"I've never seen you guys here before, are you new to the area?\".. SERIOUSLY LOVED THAT.  We'll definitely be going back to sit at the bar, if for no other reason than because this guy was on point, and we loved it.    The only thing that was disappointing to me was that there were no signature whiskey drinks or specials.. They advertise that they're a Burger and Whiskey Bar, but there's absolutely nothing that draws me in to order any kind of whiskey drink.  I asked if they have any specialty drinks, and all of them were Vodka based drinks.. in a whiskey bar?  Didn't like that, but it didn't bother me enough to give them less than 5 stars and to keep me from going back.  Although I'd love to see some whiskey specials next time I'm there!"}
{"text":"Drinks were amazing, pizza was amazing, atmosphere was amazing. We had a blast. I am so jealous this bar is not in my town. You want to go to here. Trust me."}
{"text":"Want to watch the Pens game? No worries...the little puke bartender changes the channel at will and would rather watch The Little Mermaid.   Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Aioli fries, a winner!! The fries here are AMAZING. I would rate this place a 5 just based on the fries. However, the burger I had was just a 3. I opted for the \"I don't care, whatever\" burger with a chicken patty instead of beef. The burger was overall soggy and not what I was looking for in a burger. The fries saved the day, but I am averaging the two."}
{"text":"AMAZING!  We've been to some good artisan Burger places, but this took everything to a whole new level.  The OG Mac was the best Mac and cheese I've ever had. The shells were perfectly soft with a little bite and the cheese was perfectly seasoned and so flavorful.   We ordered the kids a pepperoni pizza, expecting a basic pizza. It was definitely not. It was well cooked, flavorful and not a bit went to waste.   I had the incredibly well cooked and assembled Harper Burger. It was so addicting I did not want to put it down. My husband had the shipwreck. The one bite he shared had a lot of flavor and was well cooked.   We also ordered the white truffle aioli fries (that our 3 year old was in love with) and the beer cheese fries. It was all so delicious that we ate well past the point of being full."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype. I got the \"deluxe\" burger for $12 and while good, was not exceptionally filling and the onions were overcooked. The veggie patty they use is pretty nice though, and the buns were well made.  The trend of \"fancy\" burger restaurants can get hit by a bus. It's a burger. Whoopy."}
{"text":"The boy and I have now been here twice and while I see why there are lines out the door, I will admit that I've had better burgers. It's a nice place if you're in the mood for something with red meat, but if you are in the mood for a really really good burger and you have a set of wheels you might want to drive up the Zeli. =)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink on a Saturday night. I ordered the margarita ($8) listed on the cocktail menu, which tasted pretty bad and was served in a rather small glass that was only half full. The bartender didn't seem to know what he was doing, which is the last thing I would expect at a whiskey bar. He was also rude when we asked questions regarding the menu. I enjoy Winghart's in Greensburg, but I wouldn't suggest this location."}
{"text":"As a hungry visitor in the heart of Steelertown, what's a girl to eat? You get your arse down to Winghart's for a mean, messy burger, and an amazzzzzzzing side of fries served with a side of sass.  Since I was looking for a kick ass meal that would take away my hunger pangs in an instant, appease my tastebuds and give me a true P-town welcome, this place hit the nail on the head. I should've known that Rachel C wouldn't lead me astray.   Burgers were slapped right on the flat grill right in front of me. Mmmm, smell that? Bring on the beef!  They're wrapped in butcher paper and given to you right after they're done cooking to the pinkness of your liking. Messy - so grab extra napkins, but baby, you best dig in deep!!  Besides burgers there are some sandwiches and wood oven pizzas on the menu, again, all made right in front of you.  Besides rockin' food, the staff is just awesome - a little quirky, a lot crazy, but nice, genuine and totally cool.   Inside is a long narrow corridor, - aka the dining room, with a few tables in back and a bar that lines the grill. Rumor is they're expanding the upstairs?  Cool artwork lines the walls - super cool artwork that's loud, edgy and for sale. Apparently the artist is down with doing custom pieces. Totally worth the price tag.  Best part of my experience, hands-down, was the staff. You guys rocked my world, made me laugh, and really made me feel special while I stuffed my face like pig. Thanks for making my quick stop in PA memorable!"}
{"text":"We were here 2 years ago and then again yesterday. Service, cleanliness, and overall atmosphere has definitely improved. We shared the Shipwreck burger and truffle garlic aioli fries. The burger was good, but very rich. The fries were cooked perfectly, crisp, brown, hot, and the aioli was amazing. I would get the fries again for sure. We got a peach old fashioned and I can't remember the other cocktail- it had gin and ghost chili something in it (I know, super helpful sorry)- but the peach old fashioned was very good, just a tad sweet. The gun cocktail wasn't anything special but not awful either. We will stop back next time we are in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome!! Hands down the best fries I have ever had. We tried the white truffle aioli and the beer cheese ones and the favorite was the white truffle among the others in my group but I have to say it is a tie for me! How can fries taste so good? Owner says that his restaurant won best fries in Pennsylvania. Now their burgers are organic and full of flavor. The Harpers Fairly Good burger is to die for -- hands down best burger. And the shipwreck is also salivating good. Great beers too. Highest recommendation."}
{"text":"The waiter was super nice. The place is clean and the food is freshly made and excellent. Can't wait to go back next time I am in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The wings were good, which is why I'm giving two stars instead of one. The rest of our meal was terrible. The fries were truly awful, basically the burnt tiny pieces that end up in the bottom of the fry bin at the end of the shift, and they had no seasoning on them (we ordered the mojo fries). We had to request more seasoning, but even then, they were gross.  The chicken dip was boring and bland. Some Franks and Philly Cream Cheese with canned chicken has more flavor.   They were completely out of Mac and cheese AND the beer I ordered. I probably should have had a burger to fully round out our experience, but this was way more than enough mediocre junk food for one day.  There are SO MANY great restaurants in Pittsburgh. Don't waste a meal by eating at Wingharts."}
{"text":"The Shipwreck burger is one of the best burger's in the city.  The South Side location has much more space and atmosphere than the Market District location.  They also have an amazing microbrew selection on draft."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot, but I am not in love with their burgers. Everything else is awesome, I just personally prefer my burgers to not be fried and be so greasy.  Pizza is great, sides are great, drinks are great. I will be back."}
{"text":"Service is ok.... not what I'd call good, but not too awful bad. Didn't get silverware,  napkins or a copy of my receipt. Burger was really good. Fries and beer cheese were just warm. Beer selection on tap was limited to start with, and a couple of the drafts listed were sold out on Saturday at 4:00 PM. They had one IPA on tap and it was sold out.  Might have gave 2 stars but the burger clearly was better than average."}
{"text":"Cool little joint in the market square, small space, great food, a little loud in the back, but overall a good experience.  We decided to split several items at the table so we could try all the different options.  Excellent decision and we all left very satisfied.   Buffalo Wings- fried crispy the way I like them.  Sauce reminded me of Ray's buffalo wing sauce; very tasty, somewhat creamy, not to spicy but with a  noticeable kick. Excellent. For $13.50 I was hoping for more than about 8 wings, but they were larger wings so wasn't too bad.   The Tikka Masala wings were a real hit. Not something you see on the everyday menu; we had to try them and were not disappointed.  They taste exactly as you would think they would: a wing fried crispy and drenched in Tikkk Masala sauce. what more could you ask for?  These were pretty mild for those not looking for a kick in their wings.   The bourbon Mac-n-cheese was pretty amazing. Large shell noodles, cooked al dente, and smothered in a rich cheese blend. This was a big hit as well.   We could have skipped the Cajun fries. They were soft and mushy yet tasted over cooked.  No seasoning to speak of and we were just overall not impressed.  The big hit for the night was the hand-tossed Boomer pizza made with arugula, bacon, caramelized onion, truffle aioli, brie cheese, and crimini mushrooms. Truly a uniquely inspired creation that put your taste buds into overload. The flavor sensation is so intense I can't imagine eating the pie as a main course but sharing a few slices around the table was definitely a good choice for us.   With four adults, this was enough food for us all to eat our fill and have some, but very little, left over.  The drawbacks from the evening were that the interior dining space is very cramped and features an open kitchen. While it was quite neat to watch the cook line preparing meals, we were literally feet away from the hot ovens making the whole place overly hot and uncomfortable. Next time I'll opt for an upstairs or outside table which should solve this.   Waitress was very pleasant, well meaning, but overly absent minded; having to return 3-4 times to get things requested but forgotten.  We'll attribute this to it being at peak hours on a Friday night.   Overall reasonably priced and a solid dining experience. I'd recommend this to anyone and look forward to trying more items from the menu on a future visit."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food, really good burgers, the server was terrific, the outdoor patio is mostly in the shade, so you can get in some good people watching there at Market Square. The truffle fries were really good as well. I would have liked to have tried the pierogis but I was pretty hung over and decided to keep it simple. A nice walk from here to Fort Pitt to walk off lunch down at the Confluence, if you desire."}
{"text":"My husband ask me out for a afternoon date. We visited many stores at the strip and he planned a wonderful lunch spot at Winghart's. I have not ordered a burger out in years. We had wonderful customer service from Kelly. She sold the burger and shared the process. The meat is ground daily and the fries take a 4 day process.Our cocktails were spot on. It is rare to find wonderful food and terrific service and good drinks all in one spot. We left a very nice tip as Kelly really deserved it. This establishment was a great time and made my date with my husband of 25 years perfect. We live far from south side but if it is gonna be this good we will be back. There was something to look at everywhere art on the walls an cool decor. I have 2 boys and they would of loved Kelly she was very cute. Thank you yelp. My husband looks at your site for ideas for our dates and this was definitely and good one."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on a saturday for lunch and it was busy. Very small-bar seating and only 3-4 other tables. Burgers are excellent! not very classy, drinks come in paper cups and food comes in baskets. They have a large variety of whiskey as well. Hard to find if you don't know where it is-in the corner of market square downtown. Burgers and personal pizzas from $10 and up-wood fired pizza is great!"}
{"text":"Sat on balcony, and it felt like everything including the menus needed to be washed. Had to ask for silverware and napkins when the food came. Ordered the Shipwreck medium-rare. It came out well-done (everybody at the table received their burgers well-done regardless of order). The burger had good flavors but was EXTREMELY salty. I guess that's how they sell more beer. All in all the food was edible but not anything I would want to try again."}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday for lunch with a dining companion.  Luckily we made it to the restaurant fairly early and were able to get a seat at the bar as this restaurant is tiny.  There was not much decor to speak of but our seats right near the brick oven were awesome and allowed us to watch all of the food being made.  The restaurant was lively and there was a whirl of activity in the kitchen to watch.  For lunch I had the Hula Burger while my dining companion had the Market Square Burger. We also split an order of their cheese fries.  The Hula Burger was good with the burger cooked perfectly but most of my toppings fell off while trying to eat the burger.  It all tasted pretty good although I wish it would have stayed together better.   The beer fries were also good with better than normal fries and a very thick beer cheese sauce.  They are definitely not your normal beer cheese fries.  My dining partner said that the Market Square burger was good as well.  The bottom line for me is that the food was good here and the burgers tasted good.  I wouldn't call it the best burger in Pittsburgh but they were definitely good.  With all of that being said, I will probably head back in the future."}
{"text":"I went with 4 stars. Burger was great. No frozen meat here. The burger was large as many have said but what I liked it wasn't THICK as some places can get when burgers are too big. I went with the Blue cheese and it was just the right amount, not all over the place messy. Fries were average to below average. I had many little ones that were over cooked. The bun was GREAT. Soft, fresh and tasty. The place needs a coat rack this time of year. The place is small but bar burger places are small and usually the best. I got a soft drink, 1 size fits all? and too small. They charged me for an extra burger somehow, didn;' even notice but they came over a few minutes later and took the extra burger off my charge. Would I go back , yes. just not for awhile due to dietary constraints."}
{"text":"Eh,  very blah to average..has potential to be good, but many missing factors. First, the bartender was also the server, so pretty hard to receive good service. The atmosphere was nice though..modern, clean, hip. It's definitely a bar first, restaurant second, all high top tables, not very comfortable, but that's not a complaint, just preference.  Food: pizza, wings, burgers..but website indicates they are bar foods well made, main dish quality..they were not. Margarita pizza was burnt, black bottom with barley melted cheese, soggy. .decent flavor, but the cook needs a lesson..the wings were just 'eh' take out pizza spot quality, 8 overcook dry wings for 13.50$ AND you have to pay extra for ranch or blue cheese dressing/not worth price at all!! Salad came out with main dish, pop was flat..asked cook for plates for the pizza and he said it wasn't his job to get them.. (could he not have just asked whoever job it was?!) So all that adds up to blah experience and I wouldn't try again.  Do think potential is there, but service needs improved and cooks need trained..seems good quality ingredients wasted."}
{"text":"Can't tell you how many times I've walked past this place and hadn't noticed it.  Thankfully I found it through yelp. This place is awesome! They have a great selection of beer on tap, and an even greater selection of whiskey/scotch. I enjoyed the décor and the jukebox was cranking out some great jams. The pizza and the burgers are superb, and so was the bartender. Sam was very friendly and helpful.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome so many great options...I had the Buffalo chicken burger really good with the beer cheese fries..."}
{"text":"I have only been here once -- to the Oakland location which is now closed -- very good food and burger by the pound is a gimmick, but I did enjoy it even if my dining partner was medium on the joint.  Much better than the regular Oakland bar fare, it was probably out of place."}
{"text":"Our good friends were really talking up Winghart's, so my husband and I checked it out with them tonight! Sadly, between terrible rush hour traffic in downtown and frigid temperatures, we were a little grumpy when we arrived. However, a beer (well, cider for me) quickly brightened our spirits.  I expected the interior to be a little larger and was surprised to see two separate rooms on two different floors. Most of both floors is taken up by a large bar with several tables in the back of both spaces. The tables are seat yourself, which also surprised me. I'm not sure how that would work on a busy Friday or Saturday night. Our waitress was nice and relatively attentive until the end of our meal, when she apologized for being a bit more hectic (around 7pm).   I ordered the Hula Burger, which was delicious! The bun was soft, and the meat was juicy. The BBQ sauce added a punch of flavor, while the pineapple provided the perfect fruity sweetness. I would definitely order this burger again... and again. The only con was that it was a little messy!"}
{"text":"The Buffalo chicken sandwich is pretty good. When it's not a weekend and there aren't random, loud bachelorette parties making their way through, I would say this place is a good choice. Nothing too special about it but it's a nice place to check out. Nice staff, clean, and in a good location."}
{"text":"I want to be amazed by Winghart's - I really do. Blame it on the non-meat eating thing that I wouldn't fall in love with a burger joint. But my rating is based on the whole package, which needs some help.   First, the layout is totally confusing. It's a logistical nightmare in fact. It looks like you should order when you walk in, because they hand you menus. But, if you're sitting in the back, they'll give you table service. And last time I was in, they were showing the Sci Fi channel on TV and there was no music. Just ... kinda weird.   Second, they now have a liquor license. They have ~6 beers on draft, and a nice selection of whiskey (which, by the way, if you order a booze they don't have - they will assert that they are a whiskey bar and that's why they don't have something). The beers are stupid overpriced, however. I've been to literally the best beer bar in the world, and even they aren't this ridiculous. And what the heck is an 8 oz pour? Beers for babies? Example: I had a Rogue Chipotle. 5.5% ABV. 8 oz pour. $6. Come on now.   Third ... my veggie burger was deep fried. I wonder if they could do it on the grill - will have to request next time. The fries are really tasty though. Hand cut.   Fourth (and final, I promise): A group of four came in looking to grab a quick drink. The two girls working behind the bar first said order with the one, then order with the other. Go ahead a grab a table. No, just order at the bar then go get your table. You're confused? Me too. So, on 2 draft beers and 2 vodka cranberries, the group left \"$1 and change\". I know this because the server complained about it in front of the bar, and bar customers after the group left.   I'm definitely going to try the South Side one, because I feel like maaaybe this location is just being pushed to the wayside, which is unfortunate because it has a TON of potential. Market Square is in the midst of a 360 degree reinvention and it would be nice to keep this place as a stable go-to with just a couple improvements."}
{"text":"I've had many burgers, and the Dockworker is the closest I've experienced to something like The Plague Bringer from Kumas. Hats off to Wingharts."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my lunch to the max! Yes, the prices are a little steep but it's well worth it. The burgers our huge and so tasty. The only complain I have is I asked for my burger well done it there was still some pink in it. It wasn't a big deal, but I prefer my meat done well. The fries are amazing as well! I was surprised by how many I got in an order."}
{"text":"Tikka masala everything! That's really what is important about Winghart's. They have tikka pizza, a tikka chicken sammy and even...wait for it...tikka mac n' cheese. I make my rounds on those three items each time I go, occasionally switching it up. Their pierogies are tasty as is their fries. I did have a burger a few weeks ago. I thought I would love it but was kind of disappointed. It is also really overpriced and everything is a la carte. A Yuengling is $5...just to give you some real life prices. I really enjoy Winghart's, especially the tikka mentioned items...but I can't say it's great just because the prices aren't quite right."}
{"text":"Went here because I heard they had great burgers. Got a plain burger and fries. The burger was a littler above average. Ordered a basket of fries. The fries were good but greatly over-salted. And this comes from a salt lover. I told the bar tender and his reply was \"fries are supposed to be salty\". I should have sent them back. It could have been a one time accident but my suggestion is to order them unsalted and then salt to taste. Overall a good place."}
{"text":"Again, a mediocre burger joint at best. Service was better than average. Overall, I would give this place a 3.5.  We ordered: Fries- overcooked, burnt, ended up throwing a good third away Mixed drinks- it was alright, again, nothing spectacular  The ambiance was pretty good"}
{"text":"First time visitor on a recent road trip from DC to watch the Washington Nationals play the Pirates. Stopped by before the game for a very good burger and Guinness; came back later that night after the game for one of their signature Manhattan's. Excellent craft cocktail!  Would definitely make a return trip on a future trip to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"In the past this review would have been higher - after this weekend, I'm going to average it out with a 3 rating. They upgraded the decor in the place, so it has a nice atmosphere and occasionally a good happy hour find!  Recently, I had friends in from out of town who have joined me there before and loved the burgers so it was our first choice for dinner. Upon arriving we noticed that the bartender was the only employee we had seen (they have roughly 8 - 10 tables in the place). I sympathize as I've been a server in an understaffed place... but, he didn't make an effort to actually serve us at all. We had to ask for drinks and stop him as he rushed away in order to put in our dinner order.... and with that he seemed annoyed.  Sadly, my punjabi mac & cheese was cold by the time they brought it with the other burgers. I had to again flag him down to ask for it to be heated. When it came back out it was warmer but didn't have much flavor. The report on the burgers: they were ok, but not as good as in the past.  I'm not ruling out returning to the E. Carson location - but it won't be anytime soon... and I'll be sure to see how many people are working (and if it was that unfriendly man) before I actually sit down next time."}
{"text":"Hanging out with Moes the bartender. I was lucky enough to witness management training the bar staff. The strive for excellence and the knowledge of management is very impressive. Service was great and they make one hell of an old fashion!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience dining here.  Only giving 4 stars because of the decor was very lacking.  The most important part the food.  My burger was excellent!  Cooked perfectly medium rare.  I had the Market Square.  The bacon was crisp, the mushrooms were cooked but not soggy.  The cheese was great, but mot enough of it.  Was a little disappointed that fries cost extra.  We did get fries with beer cheese on them.  The fries are hand cut and taste great.  The beer cheese was not great.  Definitely lacking the Midwestern flare I am used to."}
{"text":"We (my husband and I with our two teen boys) wanted to grab a bite before the Pirates game and decided we would go to Winghart's. Unfortunately, we never made it past ordering water. The music playing had more cuss words than anything else. The \"F\" bomb was dropped a couple of time in less than 20 seconds in the song. We left at that point. That is not the type of atmosphere we enjoy eating in."}
{"text":"I'm sad to say I was rather underwhelmed with my first visit to Winghart's. I had the Livingsocial coupon to use and was excited to go, but I'm not sure I'll visit again.  I had the Market Square burger. It was okay. Was it $9 okay? Nope. Especially considering that $9 doesn't include fries or chips or anything. The beef didn't have much flavor to it, and for a medium-well burger it was pretty dry. Cheese was flavorless really. Bun was untoasted and dry. I'm not impressed. I asked if they had Pepsi or Coke, the server said all they have is some generic Cola. That's it.  I also ordered a \"side\" of chili. Now I saw on the menu that they have chili for $6, what I assumed was a bowl of chili. I asked our server, \"Can I have just a side of chili? Something smaller than the regular portion?\" I really just wanted a cup of chili so I could see how it was. She said \"Yeah, you can get a side.\" Now when we get the bill I realize she gave me the $6 portion of chili. I guess it was a misunderstanding, but I don't know how much more clear I could be about wanting a side of chili.  The chili was good...lots of beef, just a bit of beans, good flavor. Wish it was a bit spicier, but I like my chili spicy, so that's a persona preference. Was it $6 good? Not really. It was much too small for the price in my opinion.  We also tried the fries, which I will say were pretty good. These are how you WANT Primanti's fries to be...thick, nice and crispy, just the right amount of greasy. These were the only things that were reasonably priced on the menu, although in my opinion they ought to be included with your burger.  Now, the restaurant itself...First off, I know the place is \"edgy\" and all, but I was surprised at the presentation. This place is rather rough around the edges. Mismatched, wobbly tables and chairs, not much room for dining in to begin with although it seems they may be expanding upstairs? Really the place looks more like an old dive bar than a new restaurant. We had our baby with us, and now we know this is NOT a good place to bring a young'un.   Our table was positioned in front of a big refrigerator (in the dining space? Really?) and someone apologetically asked my husband to move so he could put a big tray of raw burgers into the fridge. I mean, come on. In addition, EVERYTHING is disposable. Paper cups for our \"cola,\" plastic forks for my chili (yeah, no spoons, just forks...), paper cup for the chili, paper tray for the fries...tacky (even for a bar), not to mention incredibly wasteful. If I'm paying $9-12 for a burger, I'm pretty sure you can spring for real plates.  All in all I'd say this bar/restaurant is about 80% bar, 20% restaurant. Not a good place for groups, not a good place for kids. Since Burgatory is pretty much my gold standard for burgers now, I'm gonna have to say thumbs down in the burger department here. BUT, I do still wanna try their pizza, and the chili and fries were definitely good, so they sit at 3 stars for me for now. They have a really cute concept here, the menu is funny and charming...it just needs a little polishing."}
{"text":"When I think whiskey bar I think of something little classier than the bar bar we arrived at. Oh, well. This place has brick walls, a bar that runs half the length of the establishment, tall tables by the walls, and a general slightly treandy bar atmosphere.  Full Disclosure: I did not have any whiskey.  I had the Hula burger which was fine. The meat was good, the toppings messy, the bun large enough for the thick patty. A fine burger but not the best I've ever had.  The fries seemed fresh cut but may not be. They were crispy and tasty.  They played recent (last 5 years) alternative hits with a few 90's hits. I really liked that.  Our waitress was great. Attentive, pleasant, funny."}
{"text":"I keep saying this and having to go back and change my reviews to reflect but, Winghart's is my current favorite burger spot in Pittsburgh!!! I was at first put off by the prices especially since the burgers do not come with fries or any side for that matter but once I took that first bite of the Don't Care Whatever Burger all my pent-up frustration over that pet peeve went right out the door. So the burger itself has pepper jack, cheddar and crumbled bleu cheese with caramelized onions, jalapeños and pepperoncinis along with Sriracha. Ordered it medium and this thing came out perfect and juicy on a light and fluffy bun. No issues with this thing staying together but i was afraid it was going to be a pick it up and don't set it down type of burger. I can safely assure you that you can put it down no problem but you may not want to. It is that good!!! We also ordered the Tatonka Chicken Dip which claims to be like no other buffalo chicken dip you've ever had...I don't know about that but it was really good.  The pita bread was the best part for me to be honest. A nice crusty outer layer and soft Center served warm.  I also really liked the look of this place. I love older dive type settings and this atmosphere fits the bill. Pretty cool decor with a nice open grill area so you can see all the action.  The service at lunch time through the week was fast and friendly with no issues at all.  Now, prices may be a point of contention here and as I said earlier, I was put off at first but got over it quickly. I do think you should know going in that the cheapest burger you will get is $11 for a half pound bacon cheese burger with the average being about $12.50. Mine was $13.25 and well worth it. The Tatonka Chicken Dip was $9.50 and probably a little high for what it was.  Next time I'd just get a basket of fries to share and call it a day.  There are a lot of other burgers for me to try so I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Came for a quick bite to eat & food / drinks / service was awesome.  Would totally recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"this is the wingharts to eat at.  get the shipwreck and thank me later."}
{"text":"I only have two complaints about this Winghart's. First, be prepared to smell like a delicious burger when you leave. Second, location. Market Square is just such a pain to deal with sometimes...especially when all I want is a burger! Ha.  Overall, Winghart's is currently my favorite burger joint in Pittsburgh, and this location is definitely the best of their options. While it's a little cramped and you feel like you're practically working in the kitchen thanks to the narrow layout and intimate setup, the food here is simply superior and more consistent than their Southside location.  Our last visit also showed us that the menu has finally expanded quite a bit. My favorite is the Shipwreck burger. It's filthy in all of the right ways, with it's white truffle aioli, brie, bacon, caramelized onions and arugula. If you're not a huge fan of red meat, as I try to avoid at times, you can get the The Boomer pizza. All of the same toppings, sans-meat, on pizza dough. An excellent alternative packed full of flavor!  I actually strayed last time and went for the Collin's Orangutan with chicken sausage, green apple, smoked gouda,caramelized onions and bacon. Yes, it's as excellent as it sounds.  I've tried their margherita pizza a few times as well. Simple, but well-executed. Good fries. Good chili. Good people.   Overall, with good service, a nice whiskey list, decent beer choices, and excellent food, there's absolutely no reason for me to not recommend Winghart's. Of course, with such limited seating, you might want to keep those recommendations to minimum, or your seat will be taken and you'll be left standing by the door drooling. Luckily, they've recently added more seating upstairs, too! Cheers!"}
{"text":"My wife and I finally checked out the new Winghart's in Southside and I walked away beyond satisfied!  The place is really chill and the staff was cool. We sat at the bar, and had really good service. The bartender was attentive and nice. I do wonder how Winghart's service would be during a busier day, but they seemed to be doing a great job with all of the takeout orders and people at the tables/bar.  The food was simply excellent and the beer/whiskey selection should make most people happy. I got the Shipwrecked Burger and it was seriously awesome! I ordered a medium burger, and they actually cooked it perfectly...while I shouldn't be surprised about that, too many places get a medium wrong. There was so much flavor in the burger, and the toppings on the Shipwrecked (brie, bacon, arugula, caramelized onions, white truffle aioli) just took it over the top for me. The fries are also excellent! Perfectly cooked and lightly seasoned.  My wife ordered the chili and the margherita pizza. Both were very good. Not nearly on par with the burger I ate, but I  would probably order either myself if I ended up at Winghart's and wasn't in the mood for a burger.  Let's just hope this new location can maintain the quality of service and food going forward, as I expect to be there quite a bit now."}
{"text":"I finally made it here after attempting the first time and having too big a group and not finding a way to fit us in because of the size of the restaurant.  My wife and I both had burgers and we really enjoyed them.  Sitting at the bar we could see how much care was put into each burger, and it's those little things that make the burger, which in this case was great.  Our bartender was more than happy to give us a taste of any whiskey, and their draft beer selection was diverse and unique.    The only problem is the size of the restaurant.  It's so small, there really isn't a 4 person table or even room for one.  If you have more than 2 people you might want to stay away unless you get lucky and there is enough room at the bar for everyone to sit together.  I though will definitely be returning for another burger, however it won't be with a group."}
{"text":"Hands down best burgers in Pittsburgh. They can do no wrong. I have been there on two different occasions and they have wonderful customer service and amazing food. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service! I wish I'd asked for our server's name, but she was amazing. She answered our questions about beer and liquor perfectly, was friendly the whole time, and accommodated all requests.  The outside area upstairs was full when we arrived, so we sat at a high top that was a little cramped for 4 people to actually eat dinner on. We asked the waitress if we could put two tables together, and while she was perfectly happy to accommodate that, she also informed us that a party outside was closing out, and we could take their table in a few minutes. We did, and it was so nice to sit outside on such a beautiful day!  Winghart's menu is a hoot to read - you'll see what I mean when you get there. The owner definitely has a good sense of humor. 3 out of the 4 of us decided to have Colin's Orangutan, a burger with chicken sausage and some other goodies. We also ordered regular fries and seasoned fries to share. The burger was so delicious, and the fries were a great complement! Unfortunately, the seasoned fries were insanely over-seasoned. They were so salty, I thought we'd be committing suicide by eating them. I asked if we could change them to regular fries too, and that request was also granted! I wasn't kidding when I said they had excellent service.  This is a great place for scotch and whiskey drinkers, but I'm neither. And yet, I managed to find the perfect drink for me! If you like sweet and fruity drinks, I recommend Woodchuck's Fall Harvest Cider, which Winghart's has in bottles. It tastes like apple pie (yes! really!) and is amazing.  I'll definitely recommend Winghart's to my friends!"}
{"text":"I needed meat. I wasn't thinking hamburger. I was thinking rich, juicy, flavorful, satisfying protein. It just so happened to include whiskey.   My drink of choice was the Desert Heat. Mezcal. Bacon. Chile. Oranges. I had the Popeye's Quilty Pleasure spinach salad and a bunless Shipwrecked. White truffle oil, arugula and that creamy smooth Gruyere cheese played a fan duel between fresh and deep.   Normally bacon is waved around like a carrot in front of the horse. Not so here. It's an accent, it doesn't need banners and pro-fat pictures.   Kelli M made sure if I didn't like anything it would be replaced post haste. I go to places like this because I can't yet master this drink/food mastery. I don't need to. I'm going to lay in the sun now & appreciate how they played \"Double Trouble,\" blues and jazz shredding the strings the way a lady needs it.   I'm a good girl. I cleaned my plate. I'll have whiskey next time."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this burger, and maybe I suffered from high expectations after hearing about how it was one of the best in the city, but the whole thing left me a little disappointed and feeling pretty \"meh\" about the whole thing.  The service and the restaurant itself had their pros and cons, but let's be honest--the entire experience hinges on the burger.  So that's what I'll talk about.  Most importantly, they missed the temperature on both my burger and the burger my dinner companion ordered.  I ordered medium rare, and I got medium.  She ordered medium, and got at least well done (if not more cooked).  At a place that specializes in burgers, that shouldn't happen (especially on two out of two patties when the place wasn't even that crowded).  Two of my toppings were likewise overcooked, to an even greater degree.  My mushrooms and bacon were both so crispy and overdone that they had lost all taste and color.  My companion's toppings were a little better, but they slathered on the aioli (which was basically just mayo) to a point where the other ingredients became overpowered and obscured.  It seemed like a fun enough place, and the ingredients were high quality (especially the meat--my burger patty, despite the missteps in execution, still had decent flavor and juiciness).  I might go back and try the pizzas, but from what I saw, Winghart's has a long way to go before being considered an elite burger joint."}
{"text":"My good friend and I left here feeling pretty content.   We both ordered the Hula burger and were actually not that impressed. He thought that it needed more pineapple and onions while I thought that it needed less soggy bread.  That wasn't what we were impressed with though, we were impressed with the sample of the market square burger that we received on the way in. That and the fries. I'd bury myself in a mountain of those fries.  The market square burger had a perfect ratio of juicy steak to molten gruyere cheese. Even the bread had a sense of substantiality. It wasn't one of those wimpy little sesame seed buns that you get at Mcdonalds - this was the real deal. I would probably eat the bread of the burger by itself and be happy.   The service was okay, they seemed a little understaffed for how many people were there and the water was incredibly sketchy. It had a really weird taste to it, I don't know whether or not it as the cup (which had weird red-orange tinges on the bottom) or if it was a problem with the tap, but I was sufficiently scared."}
{"text":"Stopped here for the awful Steeler game yesterday afternoon after we couldn't get into the door at Piper's Pub. It was really empty. Of course still a good draft list-ordered a Green flash west coast IPA. On this visit my boyfriend and I split an order of the poutine and a dozen tikka masala wings. I had never had the wings there before but the sauce was off the chain and most of the wings were very meaty. The sauce wasn't overly spicy either. The poutine was pretty good, the gravy was not as salty as the gravy at Station Street. Service at the bar was efficient and friendly too. This is always a stellar spot to grab a quick bite when in the south side."}
{"text":"Wow! Damn good burger. Had the Harpers Fairly Good Burger and look forward to the next one. A small side of fries would have been nice but not a big deal. Didn't get a drink but looked like a nice selection of beers on tap. Other food items on the menu looked good too. Even though it was pretty busy, the bar tenders were attentive and it didn't take too long to put in my order."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger joint in Pittsburgh.  Shipwreck burger and Punjabi pie It's a MUST try!  Also, they have a great selection of beer. Oh my!"}
{"text":"What a neat place. Love the decor and feel. But most importantly the food was amazing! Fresh cut russet potato fries is always a guilty pleasure, and not doused in salt! I tried the Shipwreck burger. Absolutely delicious. The burger was flavorful and cooked to perfection with the right amount of juice, and the combination of flavors blew my mind. Will definitely come again next month when I'm back in the Burgh!"}
{"text":"Giving this place four stars based on the Shipwreck (the pizza, not the burger) alone. The service was pretty bad and the girl was one of the most inattentive servers I've had anywhere. We also ordered the whiskey Mac n cheese, which while it was ok, I'm not sure exactly where the whiskey part comes in. Probably wouldn't order it again. But the shipwreck pizza...WOW! My girlfriend and I both went home and had dirty, filthy, hot, sweaty dreams about this thing. Probably the best, most harmonious combination of toppings we've ever had. Absolutely incredible and we can't wait to go back just for that pizza, even with the terrible service."}
{"text":"I'm still intrigued how this place remains open. We went their for the Pitt and Penn state game because it was the emptiest bar on the Southside. We wanted to get food and a couple drinks. They had one person on stay (the bartender) she was so overwhelmed as she was taking care of the bar and tables. We ended up leaving after 15 mins because we never got served. I've tried this place a few times and can honestly say id never go back."}
{"text":"Clearly superior to the one downtown. Had a deliciously medium rare burger there last night and it was perfect! I declare this to be my new favorite pittsburgh establishment.   The music was good, the food was delicious and the beer was ice cold!  Excite!"}
{"text":"Good, not amazing. Firstly, very limited selection of burgers. So be prepared to have what they think is good jammed down your throat. Next: Holy Fucking Shit no whiskey!?! Now, I promise to go back and re-review once the liquor license clears but Really?! To be fair, maybe I should have read some of the other reviews first and planned accordingly  b/c they are byob friendly until they become a licensed liquor provider.. Finally, I understand making you order up front during the lunch rush but I think they should take orders at the bar after five pm. It's just a little weird. The burger I had was quite good but by no means  the best in town (for that try brgr or burgatory). And the fries were super crispy. This is a personal preference thing but I dream about perfect fries all day and they're crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. If you added a good whiskey list (in the works) and the ability to order from any point along the bar, I'd probably give it four stars.."}
{"text":"Went back today and I definitely have a better opinion.  Burger came out quicker. I had the burger with cheese, carmelized onions  and mushrooms.  It was giant and excellent tasting.   The fries were very crisp.  I like them on the crispy side, but these were a little too crispy.  Burger came to about $10 + $2.25 for fries."}
{"text":"Local \"dive\" type of bar. Feels like you're in old Pittsburgh, or at least what I imagine it would feel like. I was in town for work and the bellman at the hotel recommended this place. Bartender made me a solid old fashioned and the burger and fries were A1. My burger came out under cooked but they were cool about correcting it. Overall a solid experience and one of the best bacon cheeseburgers I've had in a while."}
{"text":"Did you ever have a restaurant or a bar that was a guilty pleasure?  Winghart's is that for me.  We went here for dinner not too long ago and everyone's meal was completely delicious, the service was incredibly attentive, the jukebox was fun, they have a great selection of beers, and they mix solid drinks.  It looks like a cheesy restaurant from the outside, and the name doesn't help either, but the value you get is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this burger paradise a few years ago and have not been able to find the same quality burger since. I was originally a bit miffed because the place is so small and cramped (which as a big girl is my NIGHTMARE) and couldn't possibly see how the food would be good enough to overcome my discomfort, but boy was I proved wrong.   I had the Market Square burger and the mac 'n cheese, and both were phenomenal. The meat was fresh, seared perfectly and yet still had a smoky flavor (despite being cooked on a flat top), and the toppings complimented the meat really well. The cheese sauce on the mac was oddly sophisticated for this hole in the wall place and pretty good as well. I really liked that they used shells and not elbow noodles.  If you want separate checks, be sure to tell the waitress ahead of time. We were told she couldn't split it because blah blah blah the system didn't work like that blah blah blah it'd be easier for us to split it ourselves and tell her exactly what amount we needed charged on our cards.   It is worth noting that I have been to the Winghart's other location on Monroeville twice and the food doesn't taste as good. Try to get to the original if you can!"}
{"text":"After a lack luster first time at this location,  I decided to give this place another chance and had a great experience. My group of 5 was seated promptly during lunch time on Sunday and the service was impeccable from top to bottom. Our server was extremely prompt, knowledgeable, and friendly without being fake. She was extremely attentive to not only our table, but her entire section which was full. This was way different than the first time I was here when there were about 3 tables full in the place and none of the waitstaff seemed concerned about waiting on them.   We had all sorts of apps--Garbage fries, Tatonka Chicken Dip, chili, fries and beer cheese and they were all received well. Everyone was in love with the pita that went with the chicken dip.  We also had a variety of burgers and sandwiches (Shipwreck Burger, Matolla Burger, some burger with Jame'O sauce, and a Pittsburgh cheesesteak). All of the burgers came out great, but we had to send the sandwich back because it was dried out. After a quick swap, it was made fresh and my nephew chowed down graciously.   I'll be back to get the Shipwreck again for sure!"}
{"text":"We headed to Wingharts on a recommendation and it exceeded all expectations. We wanted a decent burger place and they delivered that and then some! We started with the Tikka Masala wings, which were great. Crispy on the outside, meaty and juicy on the inside, with a great Tikka Masala flavor. Then we had burgers, which were cooked perfectly and had all the right additions for unique and delicious flavors. We had some 1911 blueberry cider, which we were pleased to learn they have on tap. The Cajun fries were good too, but dipping them in ranch really took it to another level. Lastly, Caitlin really made the whole experience come together. She had great recommendations, was super friendly, and made us feel really welcome. Really great experience."}
{"text":"I really like wingharts! The south side location is definitely nicer than the downtown location.   We ordered a few things: pierogis, pizza, fries, burgers.    Pierogis are apparently fresh made daily.  I would t say they were exponentially different/better but they were good.    Pizza dough is made in house and was very tasty.  We got the margarita pizza and the breakfast pizza.  Their fries are perfect! Fresh cut and deliciously crispy.  Very well flavored and work so well with their ranch.   The burgers are what they are known for and are very good.  Not the best burger ever and a little overpriced, but still above average.  Good quality and unique flavor combinations.  We got the shipwreck which was good but a little rich and the Hawaiian style burger that was very good!  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I was sadly not as impressed with this place as many of the other reviewers would suggest. The place is under renovation which I have no problem with. The bar tender who also served us was very pleasant and helpful. While she did forget the french fries that were supposed to accompany my husband's meal, she did quickly get them out to him. I had a side salad which was fine but I think that is hard to mess up. The Lucy's pierogi's were tasty and I would get them again. I think the menu was misleading with the two other items I tried. First, the whiskey and cheddar Mac n cheese tasted like Alfredo from a jar only it tasted worse than that. My sister in law got a pizza which was supposed to have fresh mozzarella but it was definitely just regular pizza cheese. The sauce was sweeter than expected for pizza and was also greasier than I prefer.   I personally wouldn't suggest going here but I suspect I may not have ordered their best dishes and would be to give it another try in the future."}
{"text":"This almost seemed like a hidden gem to me. I've always seen it but got distracted by Primantis or Starbucks. Man, I've really missed out over the years!!  It's a great combination of American with a few options of Indian food that tastes so good. The Mumbi Pizza was excellent. The service was very friendly. The bathroom was also kind of neat (well, the door is pretty cool).   Has options of seating on main floor, upstairs or outside. This is a great place for a few friends going out or a fun date night. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I got the Shipwrecked Burger with brie, bacon, carmelized onions, arugula, and white truffle aioli - sublime! This burger was sooooo freaking delicious! The beef \"looked like it was actually a cow\" as my dining companion put it. Tender meat, huge burger, delicious accompanying flavors = so good!  Beware though, there is not much room for seating at all (hence only 4 stars rating)"}
{"text":"Service was prompt; we were one of two tables at about 2pm on a weekday. Very clean establishment for a bar type place.   The fries were spot on with the truffle aioli. I had the shipwreck and it had the same aioli sauce, which kind of all blended together so I didn't enjoy the burger as much (I'm someone to likes contrasting flavors with my meals) so I would recommend getting a more bold flavor burger with the aioli fries. My husband had the burger with the egg and loved it.  Overall I probably would return solely for the fact that they have such a diverse menu and I really want to try the beer cheese and bacon funnel cake!"}
{"text":"Dropped by Winghart's when I was visiting Pittsburgh for the Rubber Duck. Due to lack of time/cash/Meat and Potatoes was booked, I ate here twice during the same weekend. The first time was better than the second. I ordered the shipwreck burger my first time and really liked the taste of brie cheese, bacon, and white truffle aioli in my burger. Great flavor. And I was so hungry that I ate the whole thing in four or five bites. The second time I was here I wasn't that hungry so I just ordered an original hippy cake that was topped with powdered sugar. Not bad but nothing extraordinary. The service was really slow the second time around. My boyfriend ordered a dozen wings to go and they hadn't even finished making them thirty minutes later. We had to catch a bus and were contemplating leaving without our food - it was that slow. Luckily, they finished cooking the wings at the last second and we paid. Even paying was slow and we had to constantly remind the server that we had to leave immediately. There wasn't even a lot of people there but it was like the staff was extremely unprepared to handle more than a few customers at a time."}
{"text":"O, Shipwreck burger! If I could marry you, I would have proposed on our first date!  There I was, shly waiting at the busy counter wondering if I'd like you, would we get along, would you tickle my fancy....YES!!!!    I fell head over heels in love with you, you perfectly grilled medium burger, all dressed up with oozy, gooey sensuous brie, slathered with decadent white truffle aioli, your salty, teasingly smokey bacon, those sweetly caramelized buttery onions and, you devil, you...that mound of biting, peppery arugula!  You've ruined me for other burgers.  How could I see another burger after you????  Me + Shipwreck Burger = 4Ever.  Will we see each other again?  You betcha...I'll call YOU!  Often."}
{"text":"Bugers and Whiskey what an awesome combo. I sat up stairs at the whisky bar watching college football before a pirates game. The food was fantastic.  I had the Shipwreck burger.  It had brie, caramelized onions, bacon, arugula, and white truffle aioli and was fantastic.  My wife had a mushroom and cheese that and both hit the spot. We split an order of seasoned fries that were hand cut and cooked crispy.  They have an amazing selection of Whisky, I drank mine straight up but the bar tender made my wife a concoction of whisky, mint and lemonade that was tasty as well.  They have a good craft beer selection and the service was great."}
{"text":"Affordable drinks, nice bartenders, good vibes. I digged the lights hanging from the ceiling, nice effect!  Good crowd plus they have food! Good burger!"}
{"text":"Went here late night on a trip to Pittsburgh.  Place is dark inside and definitely looks and feels like a bar.   I love good bar food, and this place exceeded expectations.  The  bleu cheese burger was incredible.  They grind their own chuck every day per the menu.  Cooked perfectly.  My son had a pizza and it was awesome .... very thin crust and very tasy.  The buffalo wings were also fresh and very good.  I would absolutely return here ... all 3 items were awesome."}
{"text":"We were told to try this place by 3 diff people on this trip. Made it in today before heading to airport. Probably the best burger I have ever had. It was so good. Also had the pirogies. Yum! Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"What I like best about this place?  Blues music was playing in Market Square last weekend and it was pretty crowded, as were most restaurants in Market Square.  We eyed the quaint upstairs balcony of this venue tucked in the corner and saw empty tables so headed here with no wait, an awesome view and incredible sounds, and a very quaint space in which to enjoy the evening.  The food?  We both got wings.  They were good -- expensive, but good.  Definitely will check this out again (unless Yelp readers head there now and make it crowded)!!!"}
{"text":"Average ho-hum.    Setting is nice enough.  Menu selections are pretty blah.  I actually thought the menus set on our table were placemats instead of menus.  My bad.  Looked over both sides and I just wasn't entirely in the mood for the offerings.  Yeah, I know it has \"burger\" in the name of the restaurant but even those just weren't jumpin' off the menu at me.  So, basically the offerings are burgers, wings, pizza, a few soups, and salads.  It's just that maybe a few enticing pictures of said items would have gotten me in the mood.  I ended up ordering some wings.  What is there to say about wings, really? I would have ordered a salad to go with it but they were too expensive (and, it turns out, really big).  So I ordered the tatonka chicken dip which is served warm with pita bread.  It was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Obnoxious bouncer. Irrelevant music. Good for a quick beer on a dead night. Staff just walks around to entertain themselves. There are better choices."}
{"text":"I had the \"Whatever Burger\" and it was Amazing! one of the best burgers I've ever had. and it is the reason that I give the place a high score. Its cramped with limited seating but that kinda adds to the character of the place. but our waitress was kinda lost and confused about the menu and drinks. and took her 20 min to bring a water.  It is very much worth going to if you have time!"}
{"text":"Ok so here's the deal.  Given that you guys are consistently rated as one of the better burgers in Pittsburgh I challenge you to actually cook me a burger that is decent in the slightest.  Prove me wrong and I'll take it all back.  Before totally bashing your burger I will say your wings were tasty.  Good sauce, well cooked, not too big and not too small and crispy.  ...and the fries were top notch.  My girlfriend had a salad.  It looked great and she enjoyed it.  So for your wings, salad and fries you got two stars instead of one.  Being on a quest to sample the most touted burgers in the burgh I knew I had to get to Winghart's at some point.  They make many of the \"Best Burgers in the Burgh\" lists floating around the internet so they had been on my radar for a couple years.  Finally made it in last night before hitting a show at Club Cafe.  I created my own burger and kept it simple... Gruyere, onions and pickle.  Final verdict... TERRIBLE!  Seriously the worst burger in the city and really anywhere I've ever eaten.  You could beat this abomination with an unseasoned frozen 50% soy Walmart patty and a generic bun.  It was actually so tasteless and off putting that I thought for sure it had to be a fluke.  I would have written it off as me being the unfortunate recipient of their \"one bad burger in years hey everyone makes mistakes burger\" but my buddy who had ordered the dock worker had the same sentiments.  In a sample size of two... two out of two were so bad we were still talking about it this morning.  Burger was totally lacking any trace of beef flavor and had a really weird mushy texture.  It was cold.  The only flavor present was this like fake char / lighter fluid type flavor... like the burger was sprayed with canned fake charbroil scent from an aerosol can... if that even exists.  The cheese wasn't melted.  I never even got to the pickles as I gave up after five or six bites around the edges.  The flavor was so off that we actually said no amount of salt and spice could have saved it.  Winghart's if you're looking for rock bottom on the spectrum of burger flavor and texture... you have succeeded.  Congratulations.  On top of all this the bartender was not attentive.  It was a Monday night.  5-6 people at the bar and that included our party of three.  He could have easily served us another beer and probably the whisky we were contemplating had he been more interested in serving and less interested in leaning at the other end of the bar chirping about how slow of a night they were having.      As a disclaimer I'm not a picky eater and am usually very understanding when it comes to food and food service.  I cook a lot and know that things don't always come out perfect and I do appreciate how hard it is to compete and maintain consistency.  Unfortunately this was just an absolutely terrible excuse for a sandwich.  I'd love to know how much you paid all these critics to get on their lists!?"}
{"text":"Visiting from NYC this was the first spot we went to.I had a bacon cheeseburger,my buddy had\"I don't know whatever\"..food and service was great!."}
{"text":"Hooray! A good burger!    Considering how this town prides itself on being not fancy and blue collar I was astonished at the general lack of a not mediocre burger.   Winghart's exceed my expectations.  I had a Shipwreck pizza and the boyfriend had the burger with the truffle oil.  They were divine!  The dough on the pizza was crisp, an appropriate thickness for the toppings and didn't have too much corn meal on the bottom.  There was an absurd amount of bacon and meat in the chili.  I couldn't stop shoving it in my face.  The burger was cheesy and perfectly cooked.  The meat was moist.  SO MOIST.  The fries were also superlative.  Crispy and the right size.  The portions were huge.  The whiskey was great.  They only serve double pours so be ready to roll out of there stuffed full of amazing and a little on the drunk side.    So now we come to the part of the review where I complain.  The place burns incense.  Honest to god it smells of Patchouli.  The number one rule of decorating a restaurant is you don't want anything that smells strongly because it detracts from the smell of the delicious food. The service wasn't bad per se, but she clearly had no experience with high end service (and considering the prices for the Burg, they ARE in the high end bracket).   Now, the biggest issue was NO WHISKEY LIST.  You heard it right kids, NO LIST.  I am astonished. The waitresses response was \"The whiskeys change too often for us to keep an up to date list\".  SHENANIGANS.  If you have a laptop and a printer YOU CAN UPDATE THAT SHIT EVERYDAY.  The bar I work at has 50 billion beers and on some days over 10 beers are changed.  And guess what WE CHANGE THE MENUS EVERYDAY SOMETIMES MULTIPLE TIMES IN A NIGHT.  I refuse to accept that these people who made a delicious meal and opened an otherwise wonderful restaurant can't use a printer.  So how DO you order a whiskey if there is no list?  You have two exciting options!  One: annoy the people at the bar by pushing in their space to get a look at the bottles.  Jumping to see over people optional.  Two: Ask the waitress.   Oh wait, SHE DOESN\"T KNOW THE LIST.  So you end up just having to pick something and hope they have it. If you don't know what you should order, tough. You know what would make this easier?  A MENU.  You won't be dissapointed.  I realize there was a good amount of complaining in this review, but it's still in my top 10 places in the Burg.  GO NOW!"}
{"text":"With winging a last minute trip to Pittsburgh, a late night arrival, and in an area that's surprisingly slim on bars and eats, I remained skeptical of the one place that seemed hopeful: this place. Then I considered the location of being right in Market Square, their name (both odd & conveys a message of a cocktail bar, their logo (note sure if it was local), the photos of the upstairs bar, and I really didn't think it was going to go well. I just imagined those vibrating beepers that hosts hand you so they gyrate in your pocket to be seated.   Instead, not looking upstairs, and I think we got lucky on being Thanksgiving weekend, there was barely anyone there and we were able to sit right in front of the burger griddle. And the staff was the complete opposite of what I expected. And I loved them for it. Two teddy bears of large chaps behind the counter made me laugh through the whole night. Add on I was with the cute Canadian, and it was such a perfect odd couple pairing for the setting. I don't know if this would be a real dive-dive, and I don't know what the standards are for Pittsburgh, but I love how bare bones, and blue collar this feels.   Now. I usually put nothing on my burger but cheese. Apparently someone stared into their lunch pale in Pittsburgh and put their coleslaw and fries on their sandwich. If I were ever going to put this on a burger, it was then, and it was excellent. Large enough to not need any sides at all but a beer.   It feels like an off the beaten path place that's wisely plopped in the middle of Market Square. I dig your move Pittsburgh. I'd imagine most visitors make their way here, and if this is the style you're promoting, you're one of a kind in a very good way."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try Winghearts since we found out it opened. I'm sorry to say it didn't live up to the hype.  We ordered iced tea but they don't serve it. We ordered cokes and they only have a house made cola that tastes like pure carbonated water. Bleh!  We ended up with water.  I ordered the Denny double Bleu burger and a side of potato salad. The burger was literally a bun, burger, and 2 types of Bleu cheese. The meat was good and it had a good bun to meat ratio but I've had better burgers. The potato salad was not my cup of tea. It tasted like it had equal parts potatoes and onions. I'm taking it home to my hubby who loves onions. He will be thrilled.  My son ordered a Tatonka Chicken pizza. It was a bit heavy handed on the Bleu cheese but we lived the crust. My son ordered a side of plain fries and that was probably the best thing we had. The fries are a hand cut looking fry dusted with a little something sweet and salt. It's the perfect combo.  The atmosphere in the front of the restaurant was brightly lit and more of a restaurant atmosphere. We sat in the back which was dark and the music was almost too loud to talk (probably because we sat at a huge table made for four or more people). I wish we had sat up front.  I usually give a place two tries but I think this one trip gave me a good enough picture to know that there doesn't need to be a second visit.  The best part of our trip was our server. He was super nice and super friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered the Hawaiian burger I'm not sure if that's what it's called but it had bbq sauce on it it was pretty good I would of liked it better if it was sliced pineapple instead of pieces. I also order the truffle fries which were delicious. I'll definitely come back and try the other burgers"}
{"text":"For me, the original takes top prize here. Especially after the absolutely awful experience I had at the Southside location some months back. Never. Again.  All the best chefs, managers, and waitresses work at this location. There staff seems to be long term, which suggests to me that they really like it there. They are incredibly friendly, knowledgeable about their products, and chatty without being annoyingly so. And the music they play - I love it. The music selections have never irked me when I've stopped it.  My favorite burger there, and in fact the only burger I've ever ordered lol, is the Shipwreck. I will admit that about halfway through it starts to taste extremely rich, but it is so delicious. In fact, I had one at lunch yesterday and it was even better than the first time I had it, if that's possible. I'll miss this place once I move."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time for a late night dinner on Saturday. It's a small place but it has a very laid back vibe to it. We had a group of 10 and they were able to seat us immediately upstairs. Upstairs there is a table on the balcony, a bar and more tables. It's a good spot to grab some drinks and food bar food with good company.   The menu is pretty extensive for this bar lounge/restaurant. I wasn't really hungry when I came, but when the food came out, it was so good I ended up eating everything. I really liked the Bacon Perogies and Truffle Chicken Wings. I've never had perogies before but it's a Polish dumplings filled with potatoes and cheese. I liked the chicken wings because I've never had truffle flavored wings before and anything truffle is pretty good.   Also enjoyed the Beer a Cheese and Bacon Funnel Cake.   We had a large party and I am glad the service was on point. They were able to accommodate all our food requests and didn't mess anything up. Definitely check this place out if you're in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"If you're into high class or fancy shmancy restaurants this is not the place for you.  I however prefer a good bar with great food and equally good service and Winghart's is just that.  They have a more than adequate selection of local craft brews as well as all the traditional American light beers.  I ordered The Necessity and enjoyed every bite of my burger which was excellently prepared.  This was my first Pittsburgh experience and preferred the food here rather than at Primanti Bros."}
{"text":"There are a lot of reasons not to go to Winghart's: it's the size of a postage stamp, so you're lucky to get a table, parking is...challenging (the closest metered parking is 25 cents for 5 minutes). And yet? When we talk in my house about the best burgers we've had in Pittsburgh, we talk about Winghart's. The burgers are tasty, full of flavor and they're only the beginning of the menu: I am still a sucker for the Pittsburgh salad, complete with fries, so that's what I had (in addition to several bites of a Hula Burger).  You might think about going somewhere else that's easier to get to or has a table waiting: don't settle. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome place, awesome burger. Service, perfect. Food, perfect. I need say no more. Peace out!"}
{"text":"Ahh.....what can I say this place is amazing!! The burger variety is just as unique as the place itself. The atmosphere has been updated since my last visit a year ago....  The staff is friendly and upbeat...the atmosphere is pleasant, you have a choice of dining upstairs or downstairs. Both options are pleasing.   The food is just great...the service is great....just try it you'll have no regrets...I promise"}
{"text":"I came in for lunch to find the spot completely empty which is understandable considering there are cheaper burgers available closer to the center of Pitt's campus. Unfazed by the inconvenience, I came here expecting a higher quality burger.  I opted for the Jefferson's Repeal burger. As I waited, I counted that they have 17 craft beers on tap. I didn't try one because of the time of day, so I can't vouch for the freshness of the beer. Anyway, it wasn't long before my burger was ready. It was cooked closer to medium than medium rare, but to be fair I don't know any other place in Oakland which cooks burgers to customers' requests. I liked the tangy and tangy barbecue sauce. Also, I thought the fried onions added a nice textural contrast to the burger.  Lastly, I found the service to be fast and friendly. I was in and out in under 25 minutes which I really appreciated considering I was in a hurry. The only other note I can make is that there is a dance floor upstairs. I didn't scope it out, so the dance area might be a subject of inquiry for a review update or another yelper!"}
{"text":"Undoubtedly, Winghart's serves the best burger in Pittsburgh that I've tried so far. They accomplish this feat very simply: quality meat, fresh ingredients, cooked to your specifications.   The focus of Winghart's menu is pizza and burgers, so I decided to take advantage of the fresh pizza ingredients and the house grounded meat by ordering a medium rare burger with fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, and fresh basil. The burger was juicy and cooked to a perfect medium rare. My friend - who never finishes his food - ordered a Market Square burger and finished the whole burger. Being overly picky, I thought the bottom bun was a bit too thick, but, in defense, the burgers are very juicy and need strong, absorbent support.  The ambiance of the bar is warm and compact. There is an open kitchen which you can sit right in front of and watch the chef prepare the food. The waitstaff was attentive and friendly. Personally, I enjoyed the Indie Pop music (e.g. Neon Trees, Phoenix) played, yet (if Indie Pop is not your genre) the music is not abrasively loud and it unnoticeable if you're conversing."}
{"text":"Wingharts' Oakland location has a lot to live up to and definitely has a tough gig of balancing their good food and great bourbon with college culture while attempting to rectify the perversions of P-Caf.  Let's start with what they do well: + Burger and drink specials that are unique to the location, seeing as they're in Oakland and need to pull in the college crowd somehow. + Outdoor seating that makes solid use of the patio. + A mostly remodeled inside that will both remind you of the loud, disgusting, hardly conscious nights you had at P-Caf as well as impress you that they were able to cover up \"that spot\" or fill in \"that hole\" or even turn this building into something that didn't smell like vomit and old drugs.  But, as most places in Oakland, there are some downsides: - Don't come expecting the flavor of the other locations. Each Wingharts seems to have built its own culture, and the Oakland location is good for specials and letting loose a bit. I've never had a negative experience with any of the servers and the guys at the bar have always been rad, but I can see how someone might get upset if they come expecting Downtown service in an Oakland location. - If you're not in college, maybe save your visit for the summer. Not that there's anything wrong with being in college, but it can be a bit much for someone not deep in it as well.  As much as I'll miss the P-Caf staple of underage drinking, dancing, and blacking out at Trivia Night, I think Wingharts picked up a good location and am looking forward to what that they continue to do with it."}
{"text":"Received response from customer service that they made mistake updating menu and would refund me and get gift card! Gonna come here again and try their burgers :)"}
{"text":"I now see why so many say this place has the best burger in the burg. The freshly ground meat makes the difference. The burger was cooked perfectly and the bun was just as awesome as the meat. Kelly, our barmaid/waitress was awesome too. She makes some killer mixed drinks and the service was great. The only negative thing for me would be the parking and the traffic. But then, I'm from Butler and I'm not very tolerant of the big city congestion."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a small bite with my girlfriend, I say small bite cause we had a dinner reservation really late that night and we were just looking for something to hold us over until then. We split an order of the beer cheese fries and a pepperoni roll. The roll was nothing to write home about- cheese and pepperoni wrapped around a soft pretzel like crust served with some marinara sauce to dip. The fries were great though! Fresh-cut fries topped with melty beer cheese. The beer cheese was almost like a spread, kind of thick with a sharp cheddar flavor with some spice and beer mixed in. Would definitely order those again or anything else on the menu that includes the beer cheese!   Our waitress was super friendly, I have to come back to see if Winghart's is worthy of a 5th star only because I can't rate them on fries and rolls alone!"}
{"text":"As a big burger lover, when I visit a town I always make sure to visit a restaurant known for good burgers. Based on the reviews here and elsewhere on the internet, I decided to check out Winghart's. I am glad that I did because it was a very delicious burger.  Wingharts is a pretty small place in Market Square, but it does have some outside seating which is helpful if you go at a popular time. The menu is small, basically just burgers and pizza. But since they do these so well they don't really need to add anything to the menu. I went with a burger with bacon and cheese on it and it was outstanding. Sometimes when you order a burger with bacon the bacon can overpower the burger, but not so here. The bacon was a perfect compliment to the very tasty patty.  Only negative aspect of my experience is the waitress, while very nice, wasn't the most attentive waitress. But it wasn't bad enough that I would not come back or recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp, and since it was a short walk from our friend's apartment we decided it was the place to go.  We waited about 10 minutes for an inside, upstairs, table for the 4 of us.  We started with an order of the truffle aioli fries, suggest getting these, and also an order of the Grampa style pierogis, which are fried with bacon and onions.  They were both fabulous and would definitely get both again.  The hubs and I both went with burgers because one of the main reasons we chose this place was my burger craving.  I went with the Shipwreck and he had the Denny Double Bleu.  The meat in the burgers was definitely fresh and not overworked. The meat was tender and seasoned , but not overly, because we both had multiple toppings on the burger.  If it was seasoned too much we would have had a salt overload.  All 4 of us were impressed and will be back again. Unfortunately no military discount."}
{"text":"We went here tonight after seeing other great reviews on Yelp. We're from out of town and never been to Pittsburgh before so highly depend on Yelp reviews on where to go and this place screamed exactly what we were looking for.  We get there and greeted by two of the servers. Immediately they're super friendly and helpful. We decide to eat outdoors and find a seat.   I really didn't know what I wanted but I knew I'd like a cocktail first. Looking at their menu, I really wanted a gin and tonic. I'm not a big gin drinker. I only like Hendricks but the bartender came out to me to explain different gins he had that I might like. He suggested I try Plymouth instead. He was right. They also make their own seltzer or tonic on site. This tasted great!   For food, we had whiskey BBQ wings - delicious! A Jefferson burger - also delicious. Dude Ranch Fries - phenomenal!   The entire experience from walking in the door to we left was amazing and I highly recommend this place.     Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Really solid, huge burger with options for lots of vegetation. Good beer options for it's size. My friend got some impressive fancy whiskey. The employees were really cool and friendly.   Overall a great experience. Could be better if they put real tables in the back."}
{"text":"Ordered the Shipwreck Burger, was very SMALL and $12.00. Does not even come with fries. That's an additional $7.00, would NOT recommend this place! Burgers are the same quality as 5 Gus Burgers! Terrible!"}
{"text":"I have been to the South Side location a few times, and I decided that I needed to go to the original to see where it all started.  I was not disappointed.  The food was amazing, the burgers were cooked perfectly, and my mother and I even tried out a pizza.  Usually I hate olives, but the Rachel Goes to Greece pizza, which has plenty of them was absolutely delicious.    Wingharts makes an amazing burger no matter which location you go to; however, I think I like the South Side location a little better simply because it is bigger and more comfortable.  But then again, nothing beats that classic rough bar feel that the original gives off.  The staff was also very pleasant and friendly.  They loved he fact that my mom and I put down an entire pizza and two hamburgers.   DELICIOUSLY PERFECT!!"}
{"text":"WOW... This place actually is all it is hyped up to be.  Now myself is usually an avid fan of the \"build your own burger\" spot in Pittsburgh that I shall not name, but honestly, this place competes for the number 1 burger place in my heart.  Oh yeah!? did I mention the atmosphere and interior of this place is absolutely drop dead gorgeous.  I have already made it a point to make this place a stop on my 21st birthday celebration.  Usually having the wrong order brought out to me would lower my rating, but for here it just raised it that much more because they let me keep the burger and brought out another one.  I legitimately ate two and a half burgers.  Oh yeah, and I had a side and a half of coleslaw.  Let's just say the people I go to eat with do not have as big of stomachs as I do.  Both burgers I had were excellent.  The Market Square's homemade mustard was top notch, and the Shipwreck burger was all around amazing.  Seriously, if you go here, you have got to get the Shipwreck.    Believe me, and believe the city of Pittsburgh: this place is one of the best burger spots in Pittsburgh, and the shipwreck has officially become one of my favorite burgers of all time."}
{"text":"I never knew a burger could be so tasty (and large!!).  Seriously.  I love a burger place that is an ACTUAL burger place that asks you how you want your burger cooked (medium-rare, please!  I walk on the wild side).  That's when you know you're in for something special.  I'm one of those froo-froo nancy ladies that eats the burger without the bun, so I really got to experience THE BURGER in its unadulterated deliciousness.  It was... sogood.  Moist, flavorful, toppings were not overpowering (I did the mushroom one with the mustard sauce), and just all-around damn good.  As Rachel C said, the secret to the fries is double frying.  Here's another secret.  Share with a friend.  Seriously, they bring you so many fries.  ...or maybe don't share with a friend (LAY OFF ME, I'M STARVING).  I also like that they organize their beers on tap in order from light to dark, no guesswork, and they are happy to let you try out a sip of something before you commit to a whole glass, which is awesome.  Wingharts is now #2 in my favorites list for the SS.  I'll be dreaming about that burger until my next trip to PA..."}
{"text":"I tried ordering the falafel burger and they were out. My friend ordered a burger that was very plain. It had no sauce, lettuce, or any filler. It was only meat, cheese, and a few sprinkles of bacon. We ordered the patty medium and it came out basically raw. The meal was $22 and I would say McDonalds dollar menu burger was better"}
{"text":"Ordered pick up last night and the order was ready in 15 minutes and that is great. I ordered the Shipwreck burger which tasted delicious, but for $12 I could've gone to another burger place in Pittsburgh for half that and still have gotten a tasty burger. However, it was quite convenient and I got my burger fix for the week. Also, it came with beer cheese! Amazing."}
{"text":"While passing through the area, I planned a trip to check this out.  Our plan was to arrive around 10, walk around the area for an hour and enjoy an early lunch.  We were greeted at the door at 11:04 only to learn that they were not open until noon.  I checked their web page again and saw the 11:00 a.m. opening which matches Yelp; however, they were not going to serve anyone until noon.  I was traveling to another city that afternoon and moved on to another location for lunch.  I was disappointed not to be able to eat there.  The food may have been very good but if the hours are not followed, I may never know."}
{"text":"Okay - so I'm going through my 5 star reviews and thought I should update this.  Yes I absolutely love the boomer pizza.  However, the service isn't always the best here.  Plus, I smell like fried food for hours after sitting down for a meal here.  I'll stick with the take-out."}
{"text":"I was excited to go here after the post about them having really good wings and indeed they were pretty good. The environment was no different than the place before which was a let down. Not much to stare at, everything was mostly green and black. I did however enjoy the music. They must have had Ray Charles on Pandora cause he was all I heard that night, him and a little Amy Winehouse. RIP.   When we entered there were very few people seated. Only 3 at the bar and maybe 4 tables. That's pretty bad considering this place can hold about 200 on a busy night. She took our drink orders quickly and then we decided on wings. I chose the aioli truffle and my babe chose the garlic and balsamic. After 10 minutes she said our wings would be out shortly and we ordered our main dish. Their pizza prices weren't bad so we decided on the Trip to Greece pizza. It has artichoke spread, kalamata olives, tomatoes and artichokes.  After another 10 minutes of waiting our wings finally came out. They were hot so I was  glad to know they hadn't been sitting under the heat lamp. Mine were saucy and delicious but i kind of lost interest in them after the 3rd wing. I guess that sauce is only good if it's eaten sparingly. My hubby liked his wings too but by the time they reached the table the sauce they drizzled on them had dried up on the wing. he had to request more sauce which was rather spicy and tasted neither like balsamic or garlic to me but he's not picky when it comes to food and flavor.  it took our pizza a whole 20 minutes to come out after we finished the wings. Our waitress said someone had ordered 10 pizzas before we made our order. Really?? On a Wednesday night?? Funny that the table across from us received there pizza before us even though we ordered ours way before they did. What a riff!! Once our pizza actually arrived it was just ok. The crust was so thin it was like biting into a napkin. Not crispy thin like coal fired pizza but like one that was pulled from the oven too quick.  Even though our waitress was friendly our experience took way too long to enjoy given it was only a Wednesday and no crowd was in the Restaurant. I could only imagine how bad the service would be if i showed up with a party of people. I doubt i'll return here. If I do, it'll be for take out only!"}
{"text":"Ate upstairs. Good burger. Good fries. Meh Mac-n-cheese. Odd beer selection. Divey which i dig. Staff was cool."}
{"text":"Of all the burgers I've had in Pittsburgh, this one is probably the best. A side by side taste test would probably prove so. The burgers are juicy, the meat is so good, and something about that bread. Oh and the delicious creations they make. I think they have about 6 different burgers on the menu, which may seem like much less than other burger joints in town. I have had 3 of the 6 and they are all so freaking delicious. The Shipwreck (namesake of the manager) is crazy good... with truffle aioli and gruyere cheese. Mouthwatering. The fries are pretty awesome too, fresh cut, and always crispy. It's a pretty good atmosphere for the restaurant's purpose. Being a burger joint in downtown, I would assume most business is for lunch. It is always packed, with a line out the door. If you can find a seat at the bar the over looks the kitchen, you get your burger handed to you wrapped in paper. No plates, eat yer meat, have some friendly conversation with the manager, and get on back to work or use your time to walk around the city. Take-out is a popular option there, as food is ready fairly quickly (unless you are one of those jerks that likes your delicious fresh ground meat burger well-done). The people who work there are always friendly... willing to joke and talk if you do find a seat at their bar. I wouldn't recommend a large group outing to stop here, unless your doing take-out... and avoid going right at 12:30 if ya want a seat for lunch."}
{"text":"I was going good to try Wingharts in Market Square for lunch yesterday but when I got there it was closed with a sign on the door that read,  \"Temporarily Closed Due To Fire\". So when dinner time rolled around and I had an hour to kill in the South Side before a show I choose Wingharts on Carson for my dinner choice.   Service was spot on and my Market Square burger was awesome. Couldn't say so much for the fries that I added on for an extra $3.00 (one would think that a burger costing $9.50 would already come with fries...  Not here). The fries were mostly overdone and in peices.    I think for a burger it's a bit pricey for what you get but they do have a good beer selection, good service and tasty burgers.  Not a place I'd recommend over the other choices on the South Side but not a place to avoid either."}
{"text":"This place would get more than 5 stars from me if I was able to do that.  I don't get here as often as I'd like, but I thoroughly enjoy my time here.  I like sitting at the bar/counter and watching the cooks prepare everything; I find that fascinating.  I also find that lends a cool, off-beat vibe to the restaurant.  The pizzas are out of the world.  The hand-stretched crust is to die for and then when they fire it and you get that crunch on the outside with the chew on the inside of the crust, I'm in heaven.  I love their Sweet Georgia Brown pizza.  It's my favorite at the current moment.  Now let's talk burgers.  These are the burgers that you eat with your elbows on the tables and your sleeves rolled all the way up so you don't get burger juice on your clothes.  Ah-mazing.  The Dockworker is insanity in a very good way.  Even if your burger comes with fries on it, get a basket of fries to go beside it because those things are the bomb-diggity.  Yes, I just said bomb-diggity because they're so good I don't care.  Servers are friendly and quick, but I love the food so much I wouldn't care if they were the meanest people on the planet. Seriously that good."}
{"text":"Sat outside - had a 5 star burger!  AWESOME!  Must try - it is actually as good as everyone says it is!!!!!"}
{"text":"In order to complete the \"fancy burger\" joint development in Pittsburgh I needed to go to Wingharts. I've been to Tessaro's for their standard one. BRGR for the Kobe Beef and Burgatory for a Bison. Ended up at Wingharts one Friday around 4:30. Having never been there the boyfriend and I walked in and didn't know if we grabbed a table if they had servers or what. So, we plopped down and waiting a good amount of time. We finally wondered since it's a bar if we were supposed to order up at the front. Our waitress appeared from outside (possible smoke break?) and came over and greeted us with a big personality and lots of helpful advice. The menu with a combination of burgers and fries and pizza is a fat kids dream. She advised us to get a little bit of everything and that is exactly what we did.   We ordered a full Mattola Burger to split, fries and a Margherita pizza. What we got was a lot of food. Enough to take half the burger and some slices of pizza home. The pizzas themselves could be tackled by a hungry person. Not ridiculously large and would make a filling lunch.  The fries were delicious. I took a bite of the Burger and was in heaven. All the other burger places were good, but this one was just so well done and simple. The pizza was very good, fun to watch the guy toss the dough right behind the bar. The feta cheese made it salty and oh so good.   Our waitress informed us that they were planning on opening a southside location as well, which will be great. Working in the southside this addition would make an awesome lunch stop.   I was blown away and when I'd read how good it was, I didn't expect for it to be THAT good. Run there now!"}
{"text":"Best burger in Pittsburgh!  Shared the shipwreck and the nad-alie with my fiancee and easily I've never had a better burger than either.  11/10 never eating anywhere else for burgers"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have had in quite some time.  Great drink selection as well (being a bourbon-lover, I was especially pleased).  Staff is all-in-all pleasant.  Space is a bit cramped whether you have two or ten people.    I know there is a lot more food and drink that I want to try here! :)"}
{"text":"It's difficult to find places to eat in Downtown for decent late-night bites to eat. It's actually my #1 pet peeve with Pittsburgh. I've never understood why so many restaurants close their kitchens in such a sports oriented city where most games don't end until 10-10:30pm. Winghart's you are the real MVP for still offering great food after midnight.  I'm so glad we came here this past Saturday. I split wings with my boyfriend and they were AMAZING. Perfect size and great flavor on the Parm Ranch. Also, loved the ACE Pineapple Cider, which I've never had before. We were seated upstairs (downstairs had closed for the night). I loved the upstairs super intimate with not as much space. Very cool vibe.  I will be back."}
{"text":"This may sound crazy but... the VEGGIE BURGER IS INCREDIBLE. Seriously. I thought I was going to hate myself during every bite... yearning for the meaty goodness but NO! It was a portobello/falafel patty with this sexy spinach artichoke spread, olives, and feta ($9). My bf got a burger and it was actually cooked the way he asked! Shocker! The patty was delicious and fresh. Only bummers- the beer list only says names- not styles, prices or ABV. Also, the burgers are fairly spendy and don't come with any sides.   All and all- I'll be back."}
{"text":"They down sized their menu to next to nothing now. None of the items I used to order in the past are still on the menu. I ordered a pilsner and it was $6.50 and tasted very strange. Their service is also very slow and poor quality. I would not recommend going here."}
{"text":"Right now, everyone has a favorite burger place.  Pittsburgh is in the middle of having a burger war in every neighborhood.  However, I still find the burgers and fries at Winghart's as wonderful as can be and tastier than most of the other \"burger' places.  When I need a burger fix and nothing else will satisfy me, I head to Winghart's for their Market Square Burger.  Bacon, mushrooms, gruyere cheese and honey mustard sauce on a freshly ground, high quality beef patty!  Are you kidding me?  I would drop kick someone if they got in the way of me and that burger!  My co-worker always gets the Shipwreck Burger and we constantly argue over which one tastes the best.  Add some \"seasoned\" fries with a side of homemade ranch dressing as a dipping sauce for your fries and you can easily slip into foodgasm territory.  Lawd a mercy, I might have to go ther today for lunch!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times now and I really want to like it.  The staff is friendly, they have a good beer menu, and the drinks are reasonably priced.  The caveat is that I haven't been there during the school year yet, so I'm not entirely sure about the Oakland undergrad factor, so this review is based on the late spring/ summer season.  I can't give the Oakland Winghart's any more than 3 stars based on a few things:    First, I don't have much evidence that they can cook a burger to order.  My Partner In Cuisine and I each ordered our burgers medium and rare (respectively), unfortunately both our sandwiches came out more like hockey pucks.  Normally, we would just suck it up and eat them, but they were so overcooked and my burger (the Harper's Fairly Good Burger) was just a lump of meat with a dollop of Boursin cheese, a couple of fried onion straws and just drenched in chunky gravy (aka bordelaise sauce with pancetta).  It was sad, but we had no choice but to send them back.  The very apologetic and friendly server told us they had gotten some meat that was a bit fattier than usual and was cooking very quickly and they'd be happy to try again.  Ok...so we try again, this time hoping they don't overcook.  To our dismay, our second burgers were also very overcooked, but at this point were were so hungry we ate them.  In the end, they took care of us and despite the disappointing food, the service was impeccable.  We have returned several more times, but have avoided ordering burgers out of fear they just won't be done to order.  The second reason why I have to dock a star is the lack of seating.  Yes, they have a really, really nice outdoor area that I would love to sit on on a warm summer night.  However, since the management apparently allows smoking on the deck (including by their staff), we will not sit outside.  Really, who even smokes anymore?  So if it's a pretty busy night, and they don't open the upstairs (like my mos recent visit), you may have a difficult time enjoying yourself with your friends.  I'd recommend bringing no more than 3-4 people if you want to sit, relax and enjoy yourself.  The third reason I can't give it a higher rating is the dinginess of the location in general despite the fact that it's fairly new.  The women's restroom has a leaky ceiling with a bucket right in the doorway of the accessible stall, and in general the whole place feels dilapidated.  Perhaps they were in a big hurry to open the location, but they really need to fix that ceiling.  Fourth, is the price.  You don't get any sides (no fries, no chips, nothing).  Just the burger...and those aren't cheap.  None of the other options comes with sides either, so a trip to Winghart's can get pretty expensive if you don't watch what you get to eat.  Now, don't take this review as my refusal to return.  As I said, the staff is pretty nice, the drinks are decently priced (great happy hour) and in general it's the least offensive of all of the Oakland bars.  That said, I'm not sure what that says about Oakland bars in general...."}
{"text":"If you don't love these burgers ... you don't know what a good burger tastes like.  That said ... The bad? You have to BEG to get your burger truly rare and bloody.  Be clear with your server!  This place is always crowded ... or I just go at the wrong times? Seating is funky and tables are not so much ideal for ... eating ... if that makes sense. The good? Staff is friendly and very attentive.  Burgers are prob a tie for top 3 in the Burgh. Draught selection is pretty good ... nicely done folks! TRY IT!"}
{"text":"This is just not good. My friends and I were so excited to have a wingharts in Oakland. I can't stand the south side, and downtown is just too inconvenient if it's not directly after work. This wingharts location, however, is simply NOT wingharts.   First of all, this wingharts replaced Pcaf. Honestly, it might as well be Pcaf. The service is the same, the clientele is the same, and they have about the same stuff as Pcaf. My friends and I got there last night after work, and it was crowded with college kids. Ok fine, I get it. But then we were treated like we weren't in a whiskey bar! My friend asked for the whiskey list and he told her to use her eyes. Why would anyone gamble at prices in a whiskey bar? You could be ordering an $8 shot or a $15 shot. Also there was no whiskey cocktail list either like at the other joints. If there was, the rude bartender did not offer it.   I waited about 15 minutes for service. There were THREE bartenders behind the tiny bar and not one greeted me for 15 minutes. By the time I arrived, not many people were even still ordering drinks because it was late. This is careless service.   At 2am on the dot, after they called last call at 1:45, I had two gulps left in my beer. I was finishing it up when a man stood right over our table and essentially pulled the beer out of my hand and said it a low voice, \"it's time to go.\" I work at a bar, too, and this is not how you treat someone who only ordered one beer and was about to leave anyway. Plus it was just 2am. If you called last call only 15 minutes prior, people will still be finishing their drinks.   When I left last night, I vowed I will never go back. Not after the rude treatment. To the owners of wingharts, if you want to use the wingharts name, your establishment should stand up to the reputation the name has earned. Otherwise, you are doing your company a huge disservice by selling to whoever bought this location and is conducting business in this manner."}
{"text":"An excellent place to grab a fantastic burger. Had the \"Cheese Burger Soup\" and it was delicious. Then the \"Market Square Burger\" that was very good. We sat at the bar and were able to observe the cooking and preparation. And I must say it was an incredibly clean operation. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Easily overlooked on Carson, but definitely a gem. I've been here twice before and never had to wait, while nearby restaurants had an hour wait! They serve your standard Pittsburgh bar fare - burgers, wings, fries - but offer some more creative touches to their menu.   Definitely get a burger here, they have a combination for every palate. From the basic cheeseburger to the Shipwreck with Brie, caramelized onions, and truffle oil. Fries are ordered separately and easy specialize and split with friends. The seasoned fries are well worth the slight up charge. Only downside is the ambiance, but that is expected in South Side. I would imagine the other location has a more appealing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great lunch place. Went in and the atmosphere was laid back, staff was friendly. The menu is filled with tempting options but I was trying to be good. Went with a Caesar salad and wings. The Caesar salad was TO DIE for! The dressing is made in house and they nailed it. I also love that the lettuce was shredded and not chunky, few places get that right. The wings were great as well, but couldn't get past the salad. Be sure to check it out... You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing afternoon sitting on the outdoor balcony of Winghart. This place is unassuming but has excellent cocktails (my favorite was the Spring forward and the tequila cucumber) and service.   Our waiter and bartender Chris was phenomenal. He was accommodating to our requests on modifying our drinks and made great recommendations. He also let us taste a few cocktails they were working on for the bar. 5 stars just for him!  Food was great, got the perogies but the real star was the truffle aioli fries. OMG the handcut fries were the best I've had.  Don't miss this place, the looks of the restaurant don't do it justice. One of my favorites in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer and sat at the bar. The food smelled so good/looked so good that we got the buffalo dip with FRESH MADE PITA. Highly recommended if you stop in to get drinks and an app. Would definitely come back! I don't have a photo because it's gone :)."}
{"text":"Deafening volumes of chatter have been surrounding Winghart's and how they have supposedly created a burger that decimates all that have come before it.  No, kids. Tessaro's is still the Godburger and renders Winghart's Shipwreck burger into just that -- a wreck...a smoldering wreck. And I'm not sorry for saying so.   Cashing in my last 2 hours of personal time for the year, quittin' time came early on this wintry day, and with that, I seized upon an opportunity to finally shadow the doorstep of a place that can't figure out whether or not it is a diner or a hipster bar, and it tries SO hard, TOO hard --Winghart's is so hipster, it hurts worse than it would watching The Joy Formidable trying to...err...rock...at Wacken Open Air.  Now the Shipwreck wasn't completely duff. The meat was amply juicy, and the caramelized onions worked sugary/salty sorcery with the bacon. I barely noticed the argula and white truffle aioli, however, and the bun seemed stale, but what truly deflated the burger was the solid flap of brie, which was indolently, improperly unmelted (brie should ooze). De facto, the entire burger itself was served at a temperature that was close to lukewarm.   Let's compare: Tessaro's burger has a deep red center, even if it is cooked medium. Winghart's Shipwreck was ordered medium rare, yet had no pink inside. Tessaro's Godburger (my name for it) doesn't need gourmet accoutrements to be tasty. It is a burger for purists. You will taste the meat above all. Tessaro's doesn't offer different kinds of designer burgers, and there's nothing wrong with any of that at all. I love aioli and brie and argula and newfangled takes on traditional dishes, but when you add all of those haute components to any dish and treat those ingredients with disrespect, failure results. When I'm charged $12 ($23 was the total bill) for said failure, I'm insulted. Also, for a burger that evokes a colossal disaster, the Shipwreck is about the same size as a single at Wendy's, and honestly, I think the Redhead makes a better burger. Tessaro's is bigger than both of 'em, by the way.   It certainly looks nice when it's swaddled in paper, though. I suppose that's intended to be ironic. Hmph.   For a side (a la carte, no less), I tried Grandma Taiclet's Potato Salad, and all it did was make me thirsty and cause my lips to pucker. Grandma overdoes it with the salt and lemon juice. Tessaro's is fathoms better and comes WITH the burger.   Dessert was a catastrophe called The Hippy Cake. A twist on the funnel cake, Winghart's offers them 4 ways: 3 sweet and 1 savory. I tragically fell for Mariah's Kiss, and I can tell from locking mouths with her that Mariah needs to lay off the biris and hooch. I should have known that a bitter pill was on the horizon when I saw a portly, tattooed man straining in an attempt to emit batter into a fryer by strangling a squeeze bottle instead of, y'know, using a funnel? Rather than getting a spiderweb of hot-fat cooked pleasure, I got a much too large heap of fried driblets that were drowned in Hershey's syrup that in turn was overpowered by Grand Marnier or Frangelico (psst! alcohol=grown-up). All of that was topped with a \"housemade\" whipped cream that I mistook for vegetable shortening. Cool Whip would have been preferable.  Equally cruddy was the service. My \"waitress\" was so inept, flaky, inattentive, lethargic, aloof, and lacking in social skills, I didn't leave her a tip, and I rarely ever stiff servers (I wrestled with Scrooging her). When I came in, I was ignored while another server and some cooks/bartenders socialized with the cookie-cutter (central casting?) bohemians. I sat down, waited a few minutes, and walked back up through the narrow corridor to the counter to ask for a menu. A petite and perky young woman with an obvious fetish for Perestroika chic told me to seat myself, which I did, and after several more minutes went by, I was greeted by a mumbling, unfriendly ogress who was too busy singing along to the Pitchfork-approved playlist that was airing in the background to do her job. She didn't give me napkins (I had to grab some from the bar) and practically needed to be flagged down like a wayward bus a few times, especially when I wanted dessert (she was unaware that Winghart's makes them) and my final check (she must have wanted me to scram because she initially left me a bill with my meal without asking me if I wanted anything else). There was also an icy draft coming even when the door was closed (it was 35 degrees outside), and I was seated next to a refrigerator that several employees kept pulling out into the aisle. For some reason, firewood was being kept behind the fridge.    Gliding on fumes of hype, aesthetic, snark, and little more, Winghart's represents New Pittsburgh and is designed by those and for those who long to take bulldozers to Old Pittsburgh (Tessaro's).   P.S. My bill said \"one dude\" on it. Heh. Kewl."}
{"text":"They 12oz-ed our drinks, rather than filling the cup up all the way, and were $6 a piece. Our side order of fries was burnt and tasted only of the oil they were fried in. My burger only tasted like grease, instead of the honey mustard sauce, mushroom, and cheese it had on it. The size of the table we sat at was maybe a foot and a half wide. The food never left the premises because we all had to empty our bowels immediately after finishing the meal."}
{"text":"3.5 actually. I say 3, my boyfriend says 4.   Went here couple nights ago for a late dinner with a couple friends, didn't realize there were like no table seating, just bar stools. Nobody in the place, and the fry cook was already cleaning up. But they were supposed to be open for another couple hours anyway. We all ordered burgers: Shipwreck, Tallulah Hula, Market Square burgers. The cook, since the grill was just behind the bar and we could watch him make everything, was complaining the ENTIRE time we were there. It was funny though, watching him whip up delicious burger while cursing at no one in particular.   The burgers are delicious though, I think better than BRGR and Burgatory, without the ridiculous wait and pretentiousness. And they sure are serious about their whiskey.  I would skip the fries though, over-cooked and nothing special.  I give it a 3, because the venue is a little dirty looking and very small, also sitting at the bar wasn't too comfortable. But my boyfriend loved everything about it, so I think it's for a very specific niche group of people. Definitely a guy place."}
{"text":"Was told it is small.  Well it is tiny!   3 tables (give or take one) and about 12 seats at the bar.  Loved the waitress, cheerful and peppy!  The burgers are fresh and large.  Had the Double Bleu with bacon.  Oh yes it was juicy..run down the arms juicy...but over cooked.   Fries are fresh cut and very good.  Good place for lunch and a burger... some nice beers and a few people stopped in for the Whiskey.  You can sit at the bar and watch the chef working hard, never standing still.  Man he works hard.  The brick oven pizza looked delicious...next time!"}
{"text":"If you're in Downtown Pittsburgh, Wingharts is a must!  It's tucked away in the corner of the square and the only thing that may catch your eye is the 2nd floor balcony, otherwise it's pretty unassuming.  However, the decor inside is trendy and the vibe is very chill.  My friends and I stopped in for a drink on a Sunday afternoon while we were exploring the downtown area and we were not disappointed!  I'm a big beer lover, but I could not pass up on the cocktails here.  Our bartender/server Chris was so great about customizing our cocktails (we like things on the less sweet side) and every drink he made us was amazing!  I highly recommend either the Day at the Spa or Spring Forward!  The food shouldn't be overlooked either.  The pirogies were great, but the hand cut fries with truffle aoli stole the show!  Best fries I've had in a long, long while!  All in all we spent a few hours on their 2nd floor patio enjoying the most delicious cocktails and had an amazing afternoon at Wingharts, definitely don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Nice place, definitely nicer than the MSq, but I do like to watch the cooks at MSq.  Love the long bar and the beer selection.  If your into whiskey you are in luck.   Concentrated on the burger, that is why you come isn't it?  No sides to distract!   They really know their beef!   A fresh ground great burger.   The I Don't Care. Whatever burger is so delicious with so many great flavors...love the pepper jack and bleu cheese sharpness to go with the jalapenos and pepperonicini.  So juicy and tasty!   Cooked perfectly.   Congrats to the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Winghart's is yet another addition to specialty burger places in Pittsburgh. They have a very nice beer selection, and the service was fast and friendly. After an appetizer of Tatonka dip, my wife and I split the shipwreck burger which has brie, caramelized onions with bacon, arugula, and white truffle aioli. We got it cooked medium, and it came out more medium rare inside and well done outside. I was expecting more flavors from all the amazing toppings, but I think they were shadowed by the burnt outside of the patty. The fresh cut fries were some of the best I've ever had anywhere.  One big complaint is that they only give you enough pita wedges for half of the buffalo dip. She came by when we were finishing one of the last ones, and said, \"Would you like more pita? It's $1.99\". So they knowingly do this just to get an extra $2 out of you. For this reason, I'm dropping them to 2 stars. It's just a really shady business practice."}
{"text":"Best staff!! The Bartender Bree is super sweet and knowledgeable and the food and beer are amazing!!! Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"If this isn't the best burger in Pittsburgh I don't know where else it would be. Totally amazing burger. Best I've ever had bar none. Atmosphere was great, staff was fantastic. We drove over an hour to get here on a Wednesday night just to try it and I'm very glad we did!!  Definitely worth it and I will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":".. me & my sweetie wanted a good burger after some park walkings, short distance from the Omni William Penn, voila, here we be. Staff said they were closed for 8 or 9 months and just reopened in the last week, still getting in the groove..  They didn't miss anything. Had the O.G. Mac & Cheese, great, you can get Mac & Cheese wrong with too much cheese, this was just right. Making our own burgers, obviously all fresh ingredients and cooked to order correctly, one nice touch is, asking for BBQ sauce? The burger doesn't get buried in it, masking other flavors.  Your inner carnivore will enjoy a fix here."}
{"text":"Just finished an excellent dinner.  Burger, chicken sandwich, and beer cheese fries were great.  Service excellent!!  Great atmosphere, low key and laid back."}
{"text":"Winghart's was a late night choice made that was based off of the idea that we could get wings there, but when we got there (midnight on a Saturday), we were disappointed to find that they were not serving wings! None?! No wings, not even plain?! Super disappointed. I glanced over the menu and ended up getting the \"Salad a la Pittsburgh\" without fries and cheese. They didn't have oil and vinegar (Boo!) for dressing so I used balsamic vinaigrette. The salad was relatively filling with the egg, grilled chicken breast, red onion, tomatoes and pepperoncinis but it was still a relatively basic salad for $13. My friend ordered a large serving of fries for $4 so depending on what food you want, cost can be low. The service was wonderful- the staff was attentive, friendly and made sure we had a full pitcher of water at all times! I drink a ton of water so this is much appreciated! What I really liked was the ambiance- the bar/seating area upstairs was dimly lit with some re-purposed items around the place, very urban and artsy. Even the bathrooms were cute! I would definitely come back here to try something else off of the menu and enjoy the cool vibe!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing....service not so much. It wasn't busy either, we were the only couple there. Focus more on customers than  yelling across the room to the bartender."}
{"text":"Went to Winghart's last night for dinner. I had the Margherita pizza and shared some french fries with my daughter. The waitress was super friendly and the service was excellent. The pizza was great and so were the fries. I would recommend Winghart's if you are int eh area. I would go again and try the burgers as I here they are supposed to be amazing."}
{"text":"Look. These are the real best burgers in Pittsburgh. They also have great drafts and a good selection of high end liquor. Burgers not your thing? Get a pizza. The pizzas are also fancy and wonderful.  Waiting in line at Fat Heads? Come here instead."}
{"text":"Heard good things about Winghart's burgers. But after eating here on Saturday night, I could not figure out what was so good about this place. I had three main problems.  The first problem was that fries didn't come with the burgers. (Wait, but why?!) Instead, we had to order fries to share. Got the white truffle aioli fries and they were pretty good. Server told us that one order of the fries would be enough for the five of us, but she was kind of wrong.  Second problem. My burger was made wrong. Way more cooked than I had requested. I'm not really much of a complainer (in person, I mean), so I just tried to eat it. I ordered the Dockburger mostly because I just wanted more fries, so I literally only ate the fries and two bites of the actual burger and couldn't do anymore.  Third problem was the service. Yes it was a Saturday night so yes they were busy, but they were just really, really slow with everything. We spent a lot of the time watching the pizza guy make pizza because the kitchen was right next to us. Oh, so was the bathroom. It's a pretty cramped space, but I was not a fan of how the bathroom was literally right next to our table. I mean we had a guy dressed up as Santa chat with us while he waited for the bathroom (SantaCon was going on) and that was nice, but a table right next to the bathroom just wasn't the best spot. Also, my friend ordered a beer and it literally came AFTER she paid for her meal, and by then she was too full. She wasn't charged for the beer, but not once during the meal was she told by the server why she still didn't have her beer yet.   The 25-minute wait was fine, but of course, if I had known earlier all the things above, I would not have waited that long.  Taste | 2 Atmosphere | 2 Presentation | 2 Service | 2 OVERALL | 2"}
{"text":"Nice location! After working downtown, pre or post-Steelers game, weekend site-seeing, or a shopping spree in the city, this is a great place for: FRESH burgers, UNIQUELY flavored wings, CRAFT beers and MIXOLOGIST-handled cocktails.  Burgers: freshly ground beef everyday and they don't waste the leftover meat...charity. Well done!   Wings: their selection of sauces let's you know they care about your tastebuds...selection is very unique and makes you want to tryem' all. Ours were perfectly crisped and the sauce was on the side (love consumer-friendly options).  Cocktails: some places call themselves whiskey bars or use the term \"mixologists\", but you can trust this place to make, mix, stir, squeeze, shake, and whatever else to make a quality drink worth leaving a tip for...nearby within view, and even tell you a about a drink if necessary."}
{"text":"Burgers are soooo good. Love the new look. Great service and the nicest staff. Definitely a favorite and go back often!"}
{"text":"We weren't sure what to do for dinner, and after all the rave reviews, we decided to try Winghart's. I guess I didn't read enough reviews because I was a bit taken back by the place. To say it's small is an understatement. It's quite divey, which I don't mind, but just wasn't expecting. I am not a fan of paper plates or plastic utensils unless I am on a picnic. But enough about the negative. The wait staff was friendly, which is always a plus. I ordered a bacon cheese burger and fries. The burger was extremely juicy but not as flavorful as I had hoped. The fries were right on target for me. Overall, it wasn't the best burger, but it definately wasn't the worst."}
{"text":"Love this place! Bartender is a cool guy, and he makes a mean old fashioned. The food is spectacular. If you order a burger, it does not come with fries, so order that shit if you want it."}
{"text":"Stopped into this place somewhat randomly for a couple drinks on a Thursday evening.    1.  The place is beautiful.  Nice decorating with an edgy feel.   2.  Excellent draft selection.  Nice mix of local/obscure with some seasonal for good measure. 3.  Friendly service! 4.  The place was great without being a \"scene\" if that makes sense.   The food also looked great although I can't comment on that.  I'm looking forward to a return trip to check out the food.  Nice addition to the South Side offerings."}
{"text":"Came on a Friday night and had to wait about 10-15 minutes for a table. The area is very cramped. When we finally got seated, there was a loud party next to us.   Was eager to try the Shipwrecked burger. Disappointed that the burgers don't come with fries since they are decently priced so my friend and I split Cajun fries.   The burger was huge and satisfying. There was a little too much bread for my liking. The Brie, carmelized onions, and truffle aioli were great. Was happy I could taste the truffle but the patty was alright. My friend who had the Margherita pizza said the sauce was very watery and did not enjoy her pizza. In addition, my other friend who ordered the French velveeta Mac and cheese said it was not very warm when it came out.   Overall, not a bad place but could definitely improve. With so many options in downtown, I don't know if I would come back."}
{"text":"Just got the Shipwreck burger and truffle frys for lunch. It was amazing!!!!!!!!  My burger was cooked perfect! I will definitely be going back soon!!!!"}
{"text":"This site doesn't compare with quality, ambiance or service with the Market Square and Carson Street locations. Don't waste your time at this one."}
{"text":"I decided to come here for my birthday because Meat and Potatoes was too packed. I was very skeptical of this place because it looked like a hole in the wall. However,  when you pass the bar and head upstairs,  my whole perception changed.  It was cute, quaint and classy! Just the way i liked it. Our server was awesome and very attentive.  He questioned if it was our first time and we agreed.  He explained that they do not freeze their items because they do everything fresh. I had the burger and it was very fresh, and seasoned well. I truly had to savor every bite,  because I have never had a burger that tasted like heaven on earth.   Now to boot, their spinach and artichoke dip was EVERYTHING.  I highly recommend you to try it. If you dont like it, I will question your taste buds. Haha.   I cant speak on their beer, because I had whiskey! And he made it with love."}
{"text":"How could I pass up the chance to have the best burger in Pittsburgh?    Well.....I dunno.  I was not really impressed.  Being a huge fan of anything with pineapple, I ordered a well done Hula burger.  Unfortunately for me, it arrived closer to medium rare.  I am not into blood red staring me in the face while I try to eat.  Of course, they were nice enough to throw it back on the grill and actually cook it.  But still, that kinda took away from truly enjoying my burger.  BJ got a blue cheese, which he enjoyed.  And their fries are very yummy.    One plus is the servers.  And even though our server messed up my burger order, she was very attentive and friendly.  Plus sitting at the bar, watching the cooking show was kinda fun.  Also, be forewarned, this place is a real dive.  I am sure when they open their Warrendale location, it will be much nicer.  I will save trying another Winghart's burger until that time.  Nothing about our experience will have me running back to Market Square for a burger.  Sorry to say....."}
{"text":"I kept hearing about it, and hearing about it, and reading about it...and finally had a partial day off from work on a weekday when I could actually USE my bus pass to get there and back home.    I'm not a whisky fanatic, but I am a primo burger whore.  And MAN, did I get my fix properly at Winghart's.  I've read several reviews, some that criticized space, some that snarked at loud 'punkish' music, and some that didn't like the burgers.  Well, first off, space is an issue.  This place deserves a bigger space with more tables.  If you go as a part of a group of four or more, you may be S.O.L. for seating, unless you take it outdoors to the seating in Market Square.  This space was for far too many years the number one nuisance bar in Market Square, where the doors were open at 6 am, and the local bums were there drinking at 6 am.  And it was just a bar...there wasn't room for anything else.  It's kind of still like that space-wise, but now it's a much better commodity for the neighborhood.    But I went alone, and can't imagine finding a 'group' to go with anyway, so it wouldn't be an issue for me.  Second, the music...I don't know whose Ipod is playing, but it made me stop someone twice to ask who the artist was.  I'm a swing, big band, traditional jazz fan, so for me it was a treat to find out that Ricky Lee Jones has done a 'version' of the Squirrel Nut Zipper's 'Put A Lid On It' with completely different lyrics, and learned that They Might Be Giants do a cool version of 'Istanbul Is Constantinople Now'.  And the guy at the cash register was VERY cool to talk to about the music...and the food.  So, I go in, and check out the menu.  The guy behind the register is helpful and friendly.  He tells me that during the lunch hours during the week, they don't have actual counter service, but to place the order at the register, and they'll call out the number when it was ready.  I checked the menu, which has pizza, burgers, salads and soup, and 'create your own' burger and pizza.  I've always done the 'create your own' at Burgatory, but opted to try one of the Winghart's creations called the Mattola Burger.  The description read: \"This one has been created for one of the butchers I apprenticed under.  Two 1/2 lb beef patties with applewood smoked bacon and American cheese.\"  There were two prices, one for $12.50 and one for $7.50.  When I asked about the price difference was, he told me that $7.50 was for a single patty.    Anytime I've been faced with a single versus double patty dilemma at most other burger places, the patties weren't really all too big, so I opted for the double patty, with some lettuce, tomato and pickles, and some mayo. (they didn't have dark mustard to marry to the mayo, which is my usual sauce of choice)  He asked how I liked it done, and I said medium rare, but how much does it lean toward 'rare', and the lady sitting next to where I was standing opened her burger and said 'This is medium rare.'  It had some pink, but I like them practically bleeding, so I asked for 'leaning more toward rare.'  Then he asked if I wanted fries, chili or cheese...MMMMM...cheese fries.  He then warned me that it wasn't cheese 'sauce' but real cheese, so you kind of needed the chili to help melt the cheese.  Ok, I'm treating myself, so I'm going for it.  I wasn't looking for a 'drink', and their sodas were all some kind of odd brand, so I opted for iced tea, which was brewed and not fountain.   I paid the bill, which was just under $20, and found a seat at the bar/counter until my number was called.  Number 89!  Here it came.  A burger in a paper wrapper in a basket, and another basket with the cheese fries.  I peeled back the paper from the burger...  HOLY COW!  Or rather...WHOLE COW!  This burger was almost if not actually five inches tall, and it was NOT fluffed...it was BURGER!  And it was absolutely an amazing burger. It was ginormous, but it was cooked just right, the flavor was terrific, the toppings were the right level and complimented rather than masked, and I ate the whole thing, almost immediately feeling the onslaught of a food coma.  Then I looked at the fries...I took a nibble...fogettabadit.  Can I get a to go box?    I learned my lesson.  There are TWO places now in Pittsburgh that make a legitimate burger where one patty is plentiful.  Burgatory...and even moreso...Winghart's.  Winghart's has all of the right essence. Good food, nice staff, reasonable prices (honestly, $12.50 for the double burger is worth the price - it is HUGE...but the $7.50 for the normal size is extremely reasonable for the mass you're getting)  If you are a drinker, they're quite stocked, and very knowledgeable about their beers and whiskies.  My only complaint...space size.  I'm serious guys, break through a wall...rent the upstairs...you deserve the added business, and you have created a great product and a cool place to relax and enjoy it.  Save your pennies and GROW!"}
{"text":"Oh, Winghart's, how do I love thee, let me count the mouthfuls!  After becoming a diehard fan of those beefy amazing burgers in the downtown hole-in-the-wall, with the pleasant staff and the cramped quarters, I had a friend in from out of town, and I decided to not only introduce her to the beefy deliciousness, but to also check out venue number two on the South Side...and these guys have firmly slammed the hammer down on the carnival thingy and sent the puck all the way up to ring the bell. They are the clear winners!  The first thing I had to say to the hostess when I walked in was...SPACE!!!!!  It is large, attractive and comfortable, and there is enough space to find a seat...together.  You could even go with a group of four, six, or maybe even eight, and find a place to sit TOGETHER.  As for the food, nothing is different from the downtown location.  Both locations serve up the best real burgers in town, with decent prices, tons of flavor, and the way you like it.  It's the same menu available in a space with more breathing room.  We did order their special side dish of the day which was a mac-n-cheese creation that was creamy, cheesy and absolutely artery clogging yum! I had the Market Square burger, and my friend had the 'empty' burger, which was just a plain undressed burger on the bun.    Carl, our waiter was genuinely friendly and helpful, and seemed like he could become your next best friend. One thing that I have noticed in both locations is that the people who work there, for the most part, genuinely seem to LIKE being a part of Winghart's. Blue, the downtown manager is an awesome guy, and so was Carl. Good food and good prices always keep my attention and my return business...add a friendly staff...and I am SO there.  I really can't rave about the food more than I already have in the original review I wrote for the downtown shop.  But this new location is spot-on what Winghart's needed and deserved.    Congratulation guys, on a job consistently well done!"}
{"text":"I've always fancied myself a wing connoisseur and so when I tried Winghart's white truffle aioli wings for the first time, boy was I surprised!! Not only are the wings juicy and tender, they also manage to make the outside crispy...and bonus...they're big wings!! This pretty much translates into the perfect wing in my book!  I've seriously been craving them since I left and looking forward to making sure they taste the same the next time I go.  If they do, I'll be back with a 5 star rating. P.S. The fries are no joke. Order them!"}
{"text":"Wow, it's been quite some time since I've had a burger I thoroughly enjoyed. My boyfriend ordered the Jefferson burger and I ordered the Shipwrecked burger. Both had extremely great flavors. The Jefferson's sauce was different, but a good different. The kind that you want more of. The Shipwrecked burger's description was on point, its flavors were definitely for someone with a more sophisticated palette. It had a lot going on but it all melded together well. You definitely get the bitter, creamy, and sweet flavors out of all the toppings."}
{"text":"While I've been to the Downtown and South Side locations, this was my first visit to the Oakland location (some of you may know it as \"where P-Caf used to be\").   The office ladies and I ventured out for our Friday lunch and were pleased to find outdoor seating!   I ordered: I Don't Care Whatever burger, sans bun.   They ordered: Jefferson's Repeal burger, Tikka Masala sandwich, and BLT roll it up.    After ordering my burger medium, my coworker was told they tend to undercook, so she ordered medium well.  Both burgers came out closer to well done, which was a little disappointing.    While Winghart's earned a star for having a bunless, lettuce wrap option, they lost one for not having falafel, which my colleague originally ordered.  Regardless, the food was delicious, and we all licked our plates and baskets clean.  Our waitress was friendly and accommodating, rocking her grungy Flashdance inspired t-shirt and sharing her favorites with us.    A little pricey for a burger without sides, but the quality made it well worth it! I can't wait to to return to Winghart's, order a craft brew, and participate in Monday night trivia!"}
{"text":"Waitress: Kelly T.   Music Type: 80's dance music.   The restaurant started off on a great foot by being in the market square and staying open past 10pm unlike other Pittsburgh restaurants. The waitress was positive, helpful and informative the entire night.   Although its called WINGhart dont be misled, the burger is the best thing on the menu. We got the wings (buffalo and Jamie O.) and a bacon cheese burger w everything. The wings were not as crispy as i would have preferred but the sauce and ranch was good.   The burger, medium well was perfect! I thought the bread was going to be a little too hard at first when cutting it but it was fine. They dice the onions, pickles, and bacon which surprisingly integrate well into the flavor of the burger. The cheese also; they give you two slices of cheddar cheese. Even though you have to request ketchup and mustard, its ok because it comes out of the fridge, nice and cold which is a great contrast to the fresh burger."}
{"text":"Wingharts just has the best burgers; these are the burgers you drive across town for. Usually they play punk-ish music, though on Sunday night they had the football game audio on. The servers are usually pretty friendly, and happy to help guide you through the food, beer, and whiskey choices."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere in this place. Whiskey BBQ wings were great - super crispy and flavorful. Couldn't decide between a lonely burger or a hula burger...decisions, decisions. I chose the regular lonely burger to really taste the beef and, while it was really good, I was left wondering what I was missing with the caramelized onions and pineapple on the other burger. I will have to return to try the other!!"}
{"text":"There are two wingharts. One in market square. One on Carson street in the Southside.   Pros: staff is super nice at both locations. Pizza oven in market square is different so if you are going for pizza go to market square location. It's amazing and you can taste the freshness. The burgers are big and from what my husband says, are delish. At both locations. Pierogies yum.    Cons: in market square it's tiny and narrow and in the summer can be very hot with the pizza oven."}
{"text":"What are people smoking before having such great experiences at Winghart's? Whatever it is must be the same stuff keeping White Castle in business...  I gave Winghart's a shot with a coworker during our lunch break. We sat at the bar and watched the burger craftsman work his magic. The show would lead you to believe that you were in for a treat - not so fast.  We were both very disappointed, so much so that neither of us finished. That is saying something for two guys who love to eat. The meat just did not taste right.  I'm not sure if it was an attempted unique flavor or just a bad batch of meat that made me wonder with each bite if I was to be the next mad-cow victim. Either way, I will never sign myself up to partake in another one of their burgers.  If you need lunch in the square, hit Dibella's for a delicious sub, George Akin's for some excellent chicken, NOLA for a great steak salad, or Chipotle for an always enjoyable calorie load."}
{"text":"Great Whiskey Selections! It is located right in the heart of Carson St so it gets busy on the weekends but is definitely the most classy of the bars in the area. Drinks are reasonably priced and it's not usually overcrowded like a club."}
{"text":"I didn't go upstairs but sat near the bar and cooking line, which was fun. I had the pierogies and the chicken dip, which was a buffalo chicken dip on pitas. They were both very good, but too much. I had to bring some home for later, which is kind of great!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, ok burgers, good fries. Overpriced and a la carte ordering (burgers and fries separate). Waitress didn't place our order with the kitchen then offered 15% off after waiting 1.5 hours for burgers and fries. Nice patio seating in Oakland."}
{"text":"Tucked into a corner of Market Square is Winghart's. Don't be fooled by the exterior. They are getting their liquor license soon - maybe this week? Very exciting though the food alone is enough to bring you back.  Waitress was incredibly friendly and low key. She is the type of person you could befriend easily after that one conversation. Ordered Shipwreck and not only was the burger huge but juicy and packed with a lot of flavor. I had split an order of fries but I could have done without given the quantity of Shipwreck. Oh man though, I made some room in my stomach for the fries after having one.  Only con is that the space is small though since the weather has been nice we ordered out and ate outside."}
{"text":"Please order the burger... Please order the burger....  You know there's a reason this place is call  Winghart's BURGER and Whiskey Bar!  Do you trust me or all these yelp reviews? I am begging you, the waitress is suggesting and your wife is pleading to you to order a burger... even one of the plain one...    No... my travel mate insist on ordering a Pizza!! WTF!   As I ignoring him forcing himself trying to stuff that dried and burnt whole wheat like Sweet Georgia Brown Wood Fired Pizza ($9.75) down his throat with a glass of water .. I just want to say you deserved that!  My Shipwreck Burger ($12) is just so so good!! My medium rare cooked patty is topped with brie cheese, caramelized onions with bacon, arugula, and white truffle aioli. Yes it is juicy.. it is cooked perfectly and it is worth every penny!  Sucker you! Stop looking at MY burger.. and stop asking me to help you eat your pizza... I rather have another pint of my kick ass Thirsty dog Siberian Night Stout with 9.6% ABV! Trust me.. you don't want to mess with me after I have one of those!   Super friendly service!!   I will be back!! As there are 30 different drafts on tap... and I have not even start on the whiskey.. Maybe I should have order the WHISKEY! It is call a whiskey bar.. Fail!!"}
{"text":"Well thanks again to yelp for helping me find this place.  Came in with big expectations and they were fulfilled.  I had a bacon cheeseburger and it just melted in my mouth.  I was on the fence pertaining to if I would get the fries or the Mac & Cheese but after talking to the bartender he recommended the fries and they were to say the least great."}
{"text":"I came here in January 2018 to have a lunch date with a friend and I was very impressed! I usually only come here for the drinks but I have found that their food is amazing. I had the Mattola Burger and Original Fries and I really loved it. The food is very reasonably priced, the service is quick, friendly and helpful, the atmosphere is warm, inviting and unpretentious, and it's not a loud place during lunchtime. The ingredients were all high quality and worked very well together. I'll definitely be coming back for drinks and food!"}
{"text":"Very satisfied with the service, pizza is great and the fries are better!! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Had a business meeting downtown and decided to drop through for a quick lunch.  What a fun place.  They were playing good oldie music on the system.  Who can go wrong with the Chi Lites and Chaka Khan?  I seated myself and was waited on my immediately.  I opted for THE BERETTA. A Falafel patty made from garbanzo beans and mixed with crimini mushrooms, spices and love. Topped with spinach artichoke spread, roasted red peppers, roasted red pepper aioli, arugula, olives, and feta cheese. Along with the original fries. Oh my.. box to go please.  I sat at the bar and the staff was really engaging as I waited for my meal.  They even made food recipes recommendations.   I will return and highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wow what a great burger!! Pressed fresh daily, good quality bun, spend more get an expensive burger. These things are the best quality. Lots of odd drafts on tap as well. Good stop for an out of town-er."}
{"text":"I went to this place yesterday to get a beer and something to eat. I chose a 10 inch pizza which wasn't bad. It did have a little more grease than I prefer but nonetheless it was good. They do have TV's and were playing music.  Overall I thought it was good the service was quick and attentive."}
{"text":"This place was great. We sat on the inside because it was windy outside. It is a bit small, but very comfortable. Our waitress was very friendly and welcoming. My fiance and I shared fries and we each got a burger. He loved his hamburger and my chicken burger was excellent. The mixed drinks were also creative and tasty. Everything on the menu looked great, and we'll definitely be back to try some other options!"}
{"text":"In town for business and had a group of nine gather here for dinner last evening. This place came highly recommended by the hotel as well as locals walking around on the street at the Square. We were not disappointed with our food entrées at all. Most of us ordered burgers which were phenomenal. We did have one member of our team order the wings, and he was rather disappointed in them. I would say that he is somewhat of a wing guru and has had wings all over the country. He didn't feel these were up to par. All of our burgers however were great. These are not your average burgers, and all meet is fresh ground daily. They even advertise nothing is prepared with a microwave nor a freezer. They do have an average burger, but most of these are specialty burgers. Very unique and extremely flavorful. French fries are fresh cut as well and really good. Not the best place to take a large group however since the seating is limited. We had to pull several small round tables together for our group, however we did make it work. The waitress took pretty good care of us.  There is an upstairs and downstairs to this establishment. The downstairs is basically a long bar area. The upstairs has a little bit of additional seating which was where we were at. There is also a small bar upstairs.  The food was so good, I would definitely recommend stopping by to grab a bite to eat. Don't let the looks on the outside for you, as this is a really good place to eat."}
{"text":"Moving to Pittsburgh and living in Bloomfield the first place I heard about was Tessaro's, \"Yinz gotta try TessAros, best burger in Pixburgh!\"  Ehh, okay, , not real juicy, not much flavor, but a sort of  solid burger (I think this place gets too much credit because it has been around so long).    Then came BRG, in my opinion as good or better than Tessaro's, though a bit inconsistent.  Then there was Burgatory, best burger I had in Pittsburgh and one of the best ever, i didn't think for Pittsburgh it would get much better than that.  Little did I know that Winghart's was just waiting for me.  My wife and I decided to have the same burger, the Mattola, you know traditional, beef, bacon and cheese.  This was the best burger I have ever feasted on.  Not overly seasoned (if at all) just enough and the flavor of the beef shined.  The bacon was plentiful and crispy and the cheese perfectly melted.  The fries were also damn good, perfect fries for the supplied malt vinegar...  The beer selection, though small, was solid.   The atmosphere was what I like, small, dark and laid back.  I will be back and probably sooner than later."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was on my girlfriends 21st birthday and I have been there a couple times since. The beer selection is pretty good and the burgers are good too. The wings are just okay although they have some very interesting sauces you won't find at most places.   The building feels a little too big but the bar itself is a good size. I'm not sure what this was before Wingharts but the artwork feels out of place but maybe that's the intention.   A little pricey and they don't have Pitchers makes this place just mediocre but if you want a Late Night bar that doesn't have smoking or are looking for a drink after visiting the attached mall this isn't a bad option. Nothing special and everyone hates that feeling you get when you pay too much for what you think you received."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday night and we got a table without a wait. The server greeted us promptly and was great. I ordered the burger with gruyere, mushrooms and bacon. I ordered it without a bun and they put it on a leaf of lettuce. It was topped with honey mustard. The burgers don't come with fries, so we ordered a side. They were good.   The atmosphere is bar-casual and you seat yourself. The lighting is harsh and there are TVs playing the games. They also have wings and pizza on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food. Perfect walking distance from our stay during a Pirates v. Yankee game. Love the outdoor seating. We ordered the Mattola burger and the Harper Fairy Burger (I think that's the name). Also ordered the white truffle aioli fries and funnel cake. All was great. My favorite was the funnel cake. We ordered it with everything on it. Amazing."}
{"text":"Big disappointment, especially since I've liked their burgers in the past at other locations. Ordered a medium burger and it was well done and the patty was pretty thin (almost seemed pre-made rather than made fresh as well?). This is unacceptable in a place primarly known for gormet burgers - why even ask me how I want it to be cooked? Well done burgers are the worst. Apparently \"onion straws\" as advertised don't really exist there... instead got some huge chunks of fried onion on the burger, which didn't have the same nice texture as I expected and were harder to eat. The atmosphere was also lacking - kind of dingy inside and pretty dead around dinner time. I will not be back.. plenty of other places in the city to get a better burger..."}
{"text":"Overpriced and average. My wife and I went there for a small lunch and had a near $50 bill. How? Specialty drinks are way too high and bad, then the food. Definitely pass on this place."}
{"text":"Where do I start. Yes it's tucked in the corner and at night looked like a hole in the wall. But OH MY!  It was a tough choice but I had the \"Harper's Fairly Good Burger\" cooked medium. It has Boursin cheese, bordelaise sauce, fried onion straws, and bacon, topped with an over easy egg. As delicious as it sounds.   I had read the Yelp reviews before walking the 1/2 mile from the hotel and was torn between the original fries or the 3 cheese Mac & Cheese with Whiskey so I got both. It was clear that the fries were fresh cut. The Mac & Cheese was SINFUL!   I sat directly across from the grill. The extremely friendly staff made certain that everything was perfect. They took pride in everything they did.   I can't tell you if they had dessert or not. I was so damn full I didn't ask and enjoyed the much needed walk back to the hotel.  I highly recommend and will definitely return if I find myself in Pittsburgh again."}
{"text":"The food is okay here, not my favorite. The pizza looks good but they over cook it a little if I'm being honest here. Atmosphere is pretty nice and it's cool that it has a brick oven for the pizzas. Not a fan of beer by they have a decent selection of it if that's what you're into"}
{"text":"This is my favorite little hideout in market square. They have a great bourbon/whiskey selection and the female bartender who always works upstairs is really friendly. Edgy little hole in the wall that I love."}
{"text":"Rookie mistake, we went looking to chill on Carson at 10pm, lol. Apparently 10pm is late and Carson Street doesn't do chill.  The bros were out full force but Winghart seemed to be one of the least amateur establishments of the strip. The blaring electroni-bro music didn't bother me too much, I just needed a burger and a brew. I have minimalist taste buds so the menu options were doing the very most, IMO. I was going for a simple burger with swiss but they didn't have swiss so the bartender recommended a swiss like cheese for me. The burger was ok, I've had better. I ordered it medium well but it was over cooked. My husband got the chili cheese fries and they were very dry and bleh.  The staff is super nice though and welcoming. If I were to visit again, I would just stick to the bar."}
{"text":"Great service, lots of drink options, and the drinks are priced fairly. Good atmosphere and an extensive food menu, too!"}
{"text":"It is open! Some reviews said it was closed due  to fire. It was. Twice. But like a Phoenix it's risen from its ashes and possibly the most tasty burger and pizza joint in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the US? Outstanding flavors, fun menu, great staff. We loved the place and won't hold the fact it's in Pittsburgh against it. -reds/bengals fan"}
{"text":"Ship-wrecked burger is great. Mac and cheese is bland. Service was good."}
{"text":"Very good burgers in a good location for the lunch crowd.  The space kinda sucks, though.  If it was 50% bigger it'd be a lot more successful.  I was there when their ordering machine was down, so it was a bit of a cluster.  But to their credit, they kept the line moving.  There's next to no seating in here other than the bar and a few tables in the back.  If you're coming in here with much of a crowd...good luck.  Our group tried most of the burgers, and no one had any complaints.  The fries are delicious as well; some sort of parm-salt seasoning.  If you work downtown, you need to go here."}
{"text":"This is more 2.5 stars than 3, but I was feeling generous. The burger was good, but overly greasy. Yes - I do enjoy a juicy burger, but greasy and juicy are not the same. The toasted bun was perfect, as it was able to hold up to the burger and toppings.   The fries were entirely too salty. I had a few, but couldn't eat too many because of the excessive amount of salt. There is something else on the fries, too....they tasted a little sweet.   I did appreciate how they chopped up the pickles, getting some in each bite. The service was friendly and quick. Good place in a pinch, but I've had better burgers."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The burger was delicious and fries are perfect. I forgot what my food was called but I basically asked for their most popular burger and fries. Price point was perfect and atmosphere fits the local area very well. Worth checking out if you're visiting the area and want a burger!"}
{"text":"CLOSED (11-02-14) Tried to eat there. They appear to have had a fire recently. Closed till further notice) Bummer!!!"}
{"text":"First time in Pittsburgh and Market Square. This place looked like a hole in the wall, and it kind of is, but we were hungry and liked the menu. The place was very busy but the hostess squeezed us into a table near the bar. I had questions about the draft menu and our server gave me some suggestions and gave me a free flight to sample a few. They were all good but I went with the porter. My teen sons and I had the buffalo chicken sandwich...very tasty, juicy, perfect!!! We also got the old bay fries, crispy and spicy. My husband enjoyed a personal pizza, nice crust and sauce. The place was packed and kinda rowdy on account of the Flyers-Penguins game, but we were in town for the game, too, and so the atmosphere was fun. Our server was super busy but did an outstanding job waiting on us and was available for refills and the check. Great pub food, beer, and service. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The burgers and fries. Why is it sometimes so difficult to get a decent burger and fries? Seriously so many places have trouble getting the basics right. Not the case with Winghart's! They have an eclectic menu with some fine choices. To me, the burgers top all others."}
{"text":"Love them for their charitable contribution each year by offering a day of free food welcoming donations. This allows people in need to go in and have the type of meal many of us take for granted. And it gives us the opportunity to donate to ensure people in need continue to eat. Our orders totaled $15 each and we donated $30 each.  The food is always good. Can't go wrong with beer cheese fries or pierogies. The burgers are juicy and perfectly cooked. Nice beer selection. Fun staff."}
{"text":"Went here the other night after the movies and with a just pay half coupon burning a hole in my pocket.   What we sampled:   Arsenal Santa Cinnamon - delicious as expected Founders Dirty Bastard - this was a recommendation from the bartender and he did not steer me wrong.  Delicious!   Shipwreck Burger - out of control good.  I loved it.  Many times truffle anything can be overpowering if they have too heavy of a hand with it, but in this case it just helped to funk up the burger just enough and the patty was amazing.  Also ordered rare and actually received rare!  Nadalee Burger - really delicious.  So good I was only able to try a bite, but enough that I could say I understand why I was torn between this one and the one I ordered.   Fries with beer cheese and bacon - I am so glad we only ordered one order of fries.  The order was huge and definitely defeated us.  The fries stayed crisp even under the mound of cheese and the bacon was delicious.    This is definitely the best burger I have had to date in Pittsburgh! I can't wait to go back and try out the pizzas which looked delicious as it was delivered to the other diners around us."}
{"text":"As most of you all know, this burger joint is my jam! I will argue with anyone who crosses my path and tells me this place doesn't have the best burger in the Burgh. So don't get in the way of me and my Winghart's burger!  The real deal behind my update is that they've updated... their space! Yes, it may still be a narrow space to wiggle yourself into downstairs, but now the upstairs is open, which offers you even more space to squeeze into! I say squeeze because it's still unbelievably busy, regardless of the day or time. But that's the price you pay for having legit tasting food.  I say legit because everything here stands alone. Burgers aside, I've had a stellar pizza and now an awesome veggie Stromboli type offering that rocked my world just as much as the burger. And don't even get me started on their double fried fries! If you like crispy taters, you won't want to pass these bad boys up.  They of course have a massive whiskey list and pretty impressive draft beer line up. With two bars now, they're fully loaded and ready to go. Can't wait until the summer so I can sit out on their new upstairs deck and spy down on the square below. But, I'll surely be back before the warmer weather. Heck, I'll probably be back next week!"}
{"text":"I present to you the brand spankin' new South Side Winghart's!  That sounded like it's my place, right?  It's not... but it IS my jam!  I will not mess around with this review.  Winghart's is still thee best burger in the Burgh!  Their meat is fresh and you can tell.  Their fries are spectacularly crispy and delicious.  But the new digs...  Gorgeous!  Just what the Market Square Winghart's so direly needed... SPACE!  It's huge inside with seating for what I suspect has to be around 80 people, along with a very long bar.  The beer offerings look to be even more wide and varied than the M2 location as well.  I do wish they would have kept Arsenal Cider on tap here, but I assume they rotate out, so hopefully it will be back!  One thing I will note that I like about the M2 location is that it's fun to sit right in front of the grill.  I like the cooks and staff at that location and it's fun to chat with them while they cook and see the \"process.\"  I do miss that, but jeez, the SPACE South Side allows will be amazing for that crowd.    I did hear a little secret on why their fries are crispy amazingness.  I guess they fry them twice in peanut oil.  And my secret, they have some fancy schmancy burgers (The Shipwreck is hard to avoid) but I keep it real with just a good old fashion cheddar burger because I actually want to TASTE the burger!    So go here my friends and be merry and eat lots of meat!  Oh, their pizza's are bomb too:)"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great location, and service.  Had the wings, Cesar salad and Shipwreck burger.   Wings were the masala and regular buffalo.  The buffalo were so good and tasty we regretted getting the masala. Caesar, we just needed some veggies to go with all the carbs.  Dressing is on the side so you can add as you like. Burger.  Onions, cheese, arugula, equals tastiness.   Service was timely, friendly and informative. Location. The square is a great place to meet up with people and convenient."}
{"text":"First off let me say the burgers here are good.  The place is VERY small in a shot gun style layout.  there is a counter with about 12 stools that overlook the food cooking and clean up area.  The clean up area is the cause for my less than five star rating. Stacks of plates and baskets being washed In Full view of customers is unappealing. While the washing is happening on my visit the dishwasher broke a glass.  This area is quite close to the food prep and cooking area it is concerning that glass can fly into the food.  Got to wonder about other cleanliness issues.  Lots of Craft Beers are offered. BUT NO Non-Alcohol beers.  I have run into this lack of selection at least three times at down town establishments.  Better to sell a NA beer than have a customer order water.  Customers don't drink for a umber of reasons. DUI, health, religious, restaurants need to consider this option ."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday to watch football.  The bartender was attentive and took great care of my friend and me. They have a great assortment of craft beers, and great whiskey. The food was great too, their burgers are amazing.    The place is clean,  and they have a huge screen upstairs that they were playing the game on."}
{"text":"Neat burger bar in a busy districts surrounded by chains. Jamming out 90s music with an open kitchen. The burger options were solid. I got a long shoreman and some Mac and cheese which was served bubbling hot right out of the pan. The line cooks moved with precision and knew their craft. Decent cocktail and beer list. Burger didn't change my world but was Definately above average."}
{"text":"Dinner for four. Everything was fantastic!   Margarita pizza, great! Loaded fries, great! Shipwreck burger, fantastic! Service from Kelly, out of this world!!"}
{"text":"If you like dark, grimy, awful music and burgers not worth their price come here! Waitress took the change for our bill out of her wallet and it took her 30 minutes to get us our burgers with three tables in the whole place. DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"This place was so neat. Really cool atmosphere and interesting menu for drinks and food. The downstairs is small but the upstairs is more spacey and the bar looked welcoming to sit at for a drink.  Everyone I was with loved their drinks, fries, and burgers! The Rude Dude fries were delicious and plenty to share with a group! You can customize your burger- which I did with all your favorites! I will absolutely come here again if ever in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Winghart's Burger and Whiskey Bar does what it's name implies very well and fails at everything else.  They have a great whiskey selection and KILLER burgers.  The burgers are huge, reasonably priced, inventive and the patties are surprisingly savory and don't sit in your stomach like rocks like some greasy burgers.  They also offer pizzas, salads and sandwiches on the menu, all of which are unfortunately either typical american faire or blandly prepared.  I got the \"Winghart Attack Pizza\" with chilli, cheddar and bacon, which sounded like the holy grail of culinary perfection!  In fact, it was unbelievably boring and tasteless.  I'm still shocked, how could pizza, chilli, cheddar and bacon not be great?  But they managed to make it taste like it was prepared in a high school cafeteria and left under heat lamps.  The place is dive, it's small, cramped, poorly decorated, and they only have one or two tiny tables, so plan on eating at the bar.  To be clear, the burgers and whiskey are excellent and fairly priced, and if you go for that you will not be disappointed.  If you expect atmosphere, you venture out into the rest of the menu, you do so at your own peril."}
{"text":"Took me three visits to Pittsburgh to finally get here and I really wish I had come sooner. The food and drink were fantastic. We both started with some craft beers and ordered some wings as an appetizer. The wings were perfectly cooked and the in house sauce was so good. Next we ordered a couple burgers and she switched a house special drink with bourbon while I stayed with some craft beers as I am not much of a bourbon drinker. I tried her drink and wished I had ordered it too as we we're getting close to having to leave. Do yourself a favor and tell the staff what your tastes are with alcohol and beer and let them surprise you. It's the mark of a great business."}
{"text":"The burger was delicious.  It was seasoned well, cooked to just the right doneness, had the toppings cut so they didn't all fall off, and the bun was light and slightly sweet.  Next time I'll probably pass on the cole slaw because it was creamier than I like, but definitely an excellent meal overall."}
{"text":"This place was so-so. I guess their specialty are burgers, so i shouldn't be surprised that my falafal salad was lackluster. The falafal was entirely overcooked. I had to pick off the hard, burnt pieces so enjoy the semi soft innards. (it wasn't busy at the time, so i'm not quite sure why it was hastily made). My friend enjoyed her Shipwreck burger; however, she was a bit surprised that for $12.xx it didn't come with fries. (for a water, burger, and tip she spent $15.)   I suppose if you like overpriced,gourmet burgers in dark corner you'd enjoy this place (market square location). I'd still rather go to Over the Bar Bicycle Cafe for one of theirs. Moderately priced, with fries, and delicious."}
{"text":"Came with my work travel mates and we really enjoyed it. The buffalo chicken dip was to DIE for, as were the loaded fries. I was so super stuffed that I couldn't finish my burger,  but it was good too. The server was fantastic and felt bad about the drunk turds next to us. No worries, we still had great food and coversation!"}
{"text":"If it Winghart's is not the best burger place in Pittsburgh it is certainly very competitive. The service has been extremely friendly and helpful each time I have been there. It feels a little less corporate than BRGR. I got the feeling that the people who work there really like working there. Probably because all three times they brought it up how it is such a great place to work. It's cool to see a place where people like what they do."}
{"text":"Yeah this place is amazing.  Had the Mattola burger with a side of fries.  Service was quick and courteous."}
{"text":"Loves this place, the atmosphere is fun and the decor rustic! I sat at the bar which is in right in front of the line, the cooks were funny and they did a great job! THERE FOOD IS AMAZING, I had the OG mac and it was great! I went with a big party and everyone loved their food, they put there on spin on foods like burgers, wings, pizza, etc! They accidentally got one plate out a couple minutes later than the others (like 3 minutes) and took half off it and we didn't even ask! Seriously great food, atmosphere, and customer service!"}
{"text":"Journeyed here for a weekday lunch. Found it to be very welcoming, though a bit on the chilly side for me.  We were greeted immediately by the bartender who gave us menus and some time to peruse.  When he returned, he took our whole order, including appetizer, drinks, and entrees by memory. A few minutes later, he came back to refresh his memory.  Pen and paper are still ok to use, people.  Wings: Whiskey BBQ sauce was really salty and did not come close to the BBQ sauce at locations like Mad Mex. They were prepared correctly, however. We will just try a different sauce next time.  Burgers: I ordered the special \"Kumar\" burger, which came topped with tikka Mac and cheese and fried onions. I ordered it med. rare, but it came prepared just beyond medium. My husband's was the same. The flavor of the tikka Mac wasn't enough for the burger to stand alone. It needed something else. My suggestion? Ditch the fried onions and replace with grilled veggies!  Fries with beer cheese: Perfect. So perfect.   Service: Ok, I like to meet people, and perhaps this is what most people want, but the bartender was very extroverted. Again, I don't think this is a bad thing, but I learned a LOT about him in just a short sitting. He was really nice, just maybe a little too much sharing for me.   Experience: Overall, pretty good. We've had better there, though."}
{"text":"Another Market Square review. As other reviewers have said, the place has really transformed in the last two years... and it will continue to do so.  Winghart's is a newer addition,  and a welcome one at that!  I waited to review Winghart's, because several months after opening, they didn't have their licquor license and they weren't open on Saturdays. All that has changed.   The burgers are a bit pricey, but they are huge and high-quality.  I get the Shipwreck with homemade potato salad almost every time.  I have also enjoyed their Market Square burger. My co-workers love the pizzas.  Decent selection of draft beers and licquor for such a small place.    All around, a four-star establishment.  Why the extra star? Because I enjoy watching Dr. Who with Shipwreck during my weekend lunch breaks. Worth it."}
{"text":"I dig this place. My mom and I are in Pittsburgh for the weekend to attend a seminar at the history museum and we ended up at Winghart's because it was nearby and didn't require a reservation. I'm glad we stopped in!  At first I feared that I made a mistake...the seating upstairs was really cramped and the music was ridiculously loud. However, after about ten minutes or so the noise died down, the room became more comfortable, and we had a really nice dinner.  I ordered the Shipwreck Burger, she ordered the Dock Burger, and we split a side of fries. Everything was exactly what I would have expected from a place touting the title of a burger and whiskey bar: great portions, crispy fries, and messy burgers. Messy in a good way, of course. The \"lick the aioli and brie off of your fingers because the napkin isn't worthy\" kind of messy. The Shipwreck was truly delicious. If you're into arugula, truffle, caramelized onions, brie cheese, and decadence, you can't go wrong.  We both had a Gram Positive (scotch, orange and fig honey, lemon, and fresh ginger). It was balanced and refreshing, and it was a great complement to the rich food.  Our server was friendly, polite, and as prompt as she could be on a busy Saturday night. Though I may never visit Winghart's again because I'm not from the area, I suggest you check it out!"}
{"text":"Got food to go on Easter Sunday.  Atmosphere was definitely cool.  They were playing heavy metal rock which given the holiday made me love them more.  One bummer was their brick oven wasn't heated up yet BUT what I ordered to go was fabulous. The wings were cheap & very tasty... nice crisp & the Buffalo sauce was delightful.  They gave me extra ranch & I joked about being a slob & needing a towel. ... they actually packed me a towel. WIN, LOVES IT!!! The funnel cakes were really good too. My fiance got their shipwreck burger which he gobbled down like a starved person. Happy,  & will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I feel like this place could benefit from a little space. Entering the restaurant is very dive like and it's small/close quarters like a restaurant in NYC. If that's your thing then you will be all about it, but if you like to have some space then maybe not.   The food on the other hand was very good. I really liked the burger that I had and the beer section wasn't bad. I feel like you could put their burgers against BRGR or Burgatory any day."}
{"text":"Having gone to the location in southside, I knew the food was good. However, I was sad to find out that the service was just as bad. Maybe my boyfriend and I look like we aren't going to tip much or something, but we had to practically beg for someone to take our order. I got the shipwreck burger which is really good, if you are willing to splurge a bit. Another must have are the fries with the truffle aioli. Delish! It is a little upsetting that the burgers don't come with anything (you have to order fries and what not separately) especially given what you pay for it. Drink options are good if you are feeling like some beer. All in all really good food, just a little over priced and bad service both times I've been there."}
{"text":"Winghearts used to be one of my favorite bars in downtown Pittsburgh. After the last three attempts of dining there, I've given up hope. Not sure whats changed in the past six months but service is TERRIBLE.  We had a 10 person group, were told to seat ourselves- the waiter couldn't even look up at us. So we sat ourselves and took the only two tables left and moved them next to each other. He YELLED at us and asked what we were doing. A few friends had already ordered drinks upstairs because it took so long to get service downstairs. They paid their bills and we left immediately.  Last week a group of friends went down-- they yet again couldn't accommodate our group. The same man who yelled last time, yelled this time.  A few days later we stopped by for a few drinks, they shut the doors in our face at 9pm. This had happened a few times before as well.  Its too expensive to be that rude to customers.  Incredibly disappointed with how the quality of service has gone downhill."}
