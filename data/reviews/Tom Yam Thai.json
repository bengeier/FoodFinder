{"text":"I have been here a few times and food quality has been consistent.  This visit we ordered Thai Spicy Beef Devil, General Tao's chicken and Roti Canai with Malaysian Curry (chicken).  The Spicy Beef Devil was flavourful and had a spicy, savoury, sweet taste to it.  General Tao was one of the better ones as it was meaty and flavour was balanced and not super sweet. It was surprisingly good.   The Malaysian Curry is one of the most flavourful currys i have had.  It had the typical malaysian flavours but also had thai flavours.  Its a great curry for anyone who enjoys thai currys.  It has more flavour dimensions and depth to it than a thai yellow, red, or green curry.    I will update this with more dishes as i go there more.   Thai Spicy Beef Devil.  3.5/5 (a bit sweet for my taste) Thai Crispy Chicken.  3.5/5 (a bit sweet for my taste) General Tao Chicken. 4.5/5 (great dish) Malaysian Curry Chicken 4.75/5 (our go to dish) Roti Canai 2.5/5 (good roti but not homemade, i wish they made these to order and not a frozen roti - we still order these as they are a must with the Malaysian Curry)  Basil Lamb.  2/5 (not a very thai style and more cooked with a chilli sauce) Malaysian Curry Beef 4/5 (fantastic just like the chicken version but i preferred the chicken over this one flavour wise)  Cashew Nut Chicken. 2/5 (once again not very thai style and more cooked with a chilli sauce) Red Curry Beef. 4/5 (Good curry with the usual thai flavours)  So far we don't seem to like the thai stir fry dishes as the sauce has a heavy influence of chilli sauce which makes the flavour not as clean and off for me personally."}
{"text":"The pad thai might have been spoiled it smelt funny and taste horrible. Thats one of those dishes that every Thai place should make well The green curry was good maybe a little too rich/creamy. The mushroom soup was ok. I walked in 5 minutes after closing and the lady says \"we were waiting for you so we can close\", not very friendly. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I travel a lot for business and sometimes find it difficult to eat salads without getting bored. I highly recommend the Shrimp Salad. The flavor was absolutely amazing. I will go back for lunch to try another of their salads!"}
