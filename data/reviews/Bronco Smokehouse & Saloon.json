{"text":"Bronco Smokehouse?  Okay, maybe the name is a bit misleading as the concept wasn't fully realized, but when you hear the back-story, well, I empathized.  I was always a fan of Vicious Circle and it's martini selection, but they lacked the fun atmosphere.  Bronco may not be a proper smoke house as the menu has gone through some major changes (part of the backstory), but the modern lounge and night club atmosphere is quite fun! 

I've somehow ended up at this place before my night starts, during some fun bar hopping, and somehow, at the end of the night.  They do a lot of bookings that vary from urban music, to electronic, to drum and bass.  Heck I've even walked in on comedy shows, live music, and speed dating!  

I think they don't make any illusions about being some high class douchey venue, they are today's version of Cheers, where everyone knows your name.  Add in the foosball, all the tvs, late night menu, and their always fun staff and customer service, and they got my support!  

Food, it's so/so.  But I will tell you that they constantly add and change things, trying to tweak their offering to their regulars.  I just sampled their new peanut butter nutella cookies and cream dessert.  I was like .... WHOA ...."}
{"text":"How can this be so slow on a Friday nite? So much potential, corner location, right in DT but as friends and their management have indicated, this is becoming more and more of a drinking pub.

It's got good front area to mingle around, and a raised seating area by the windows for somewhat group parties.

What will make me return is that it's not pretentious and dressed totally casual here."}
