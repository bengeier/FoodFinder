{"text":"Super close to us so we go all the time. Great service and food is super fresh!! Our favorite is their BBQ burger. The bun is soft and chewy and the burger is very lean, juicy and has a very clean mouth taste. Will fill you up nicely without the artery clogging grease. If you are wanting a greasy lunch (ie Five Guys) this is not your place, but if you want distinct and clean flavors like we love, we highly recommend this place!!! Our one and half year old son loves the burger so much he will hold it and eat more than 1/2 just by himself!

Forgot to add that all the staff are super friendly and nice even to my busy toddler :)"}
{"text":"Decent food, but it is a little pricey for what you get. The staff is super friendly. I docked a star due to the price and also because they have messed up my order 2 different times but I already took my food to go so I didn't notice until I got back to my office. Ideally I'd give them 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"The food is good here, but when you work in the office building you can get sick of it after a while. I think the prices are a little high too so I don't eat here too often, but everything I've had is good."}
{"text":"90% of the time this place is out of the soup of the day by 12:30 pm. Very frustrating."}
{"text":"Ernesto says that this is the hot spot for lunch ec...I have it every day and the staff and my good friend Nick makes sure everyone is happy.

Good looking out Nick....."}
{"text":"The people are nice and the service isn't bad. But i've eaten here twice and the first time i got the Athens wrap and ended up throwing it away. it tasted terrible!!! 
The second time i don't remember what i got but i remember telling myself i was never going to eat there unless i had too. So basically the food isn't that great and its also expensive."}
{"text":"Love them! Great staff always polite and very timely. Nick, Sandra, and Kim are always working the mornings when I come in and it's clear that they are a hardworking group who cares about their guests! Thanks guys"}
{"text":"Pretty good neighborhood deli located in a office complex.  Good hot and cold sandwiches along with breakfast items."}
{"text":"Location is convenient especially when you don't feel like leaving the office for lunch. Prices are a little high. Food is good but nothing to write home about. If I did not work in the building I would not go out of my way to visit.  Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious dine in and take out breakfast and lunch choices. They have a large lunch menu full of cold and hot sandwiches, wraps and salads. They serve Starbuck's coffee and Tazo teas. Great little place!"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Boston , so after eating here all I can say is \"WICKED AWESOME\". The food is great, but I must say the best thing is how they treat you , the staff is friendly and greets you with smile, the food delicious and the atmosphere is fun. Do yourself a favor and go visit Nick and his staff , you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite. Pretty extensive menu, and they have gluten-free breads and wraps to boot. You can check-out their menu online. It's always nice to find a restraunt that accommodates diners with gluten sensitivities. I had the veggie sandwich, cole slaw, and drink combo (see pics). For around $9, including tax, I'd say it was a good meal for a fair price. If you decide to stop in, say \"hi\" to Nick (owner), Mariella, and Jenny. Oh, and don't forget to pick-up a lunch or coffee loyalty card!"}
{"text":"I used to come here very often like 3 to 4 times a week. The food was always good and the staff was just so friendly and took the time to get to know the people and customers. I could walk in and be called by name after only a couple times going. After the new staff took over however the food has gone so far down hill and they are just not as friendly as the other people. 
They give you rude answers if you don't tip for being something that is premade or ordered online. I never got that with the other staff. I would not recommend coming here on lunch now, the food is just weird creations with even weirder names. They have a \"chimichanga\" that is not even fried so I don't think they are advertising that correctly. The chicken and dumplings are so gross and so over cooked! I literally burned my tongue just trying it, they used slices of wheat bread for the dumplings. The pizza is so soggy and tasteless. I don't expect a 5 star chef to cook this but if they are going to charge you an arm and a leg please just make the food better and stop throwing together your about to expire items and calling it food."}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review to a 1 star after trying once again to order lunch here. Now I can not only say the food takes way too long but some of the employees are incredibly rude. A young tall guy maybe around the age of 20 acted unprofessional and absolutely rude that I just can't go back. This place obviously gets business because of the people working in the offices. If it weren't for them I don't see how this place would stay in business"}
{"text":"Great food quality. The fries are amazing, not to mention really competitive prices. $8 for a sandwich, fries and a drink. The menu is diverse and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I never knew this little sandwich gem existed next to my office. It's walking distance from our building so it's very convenient especially if you got a precious parking spot that you are not willing to lose! 

They have both hot and cold sandwiches. You order at the counter and take a number. They bring the food to your table. I tried the philly cheese steak sandwich (without cheese unfortunately) and a side of potato salad. 

The order came out pretty quick. The food was hot and delicious. The potato salad was fresh and was done exactly right. Even though my sandwich did not have cheese in it, it was about one of the best steak sandwiches I've had! The portion size was also pretty big. I could have easily packed half my sandwich for dinner but it was so good, I decided to just go ahead and finish it (embarrassing, I know!). Prices are average so it's definitely a spot you wouldn't mind visiting often. 

I'm so glad my TL shared this place with me. He has tried pretty much every sandwich they have and I probably will be doing the same soon. 

Excellent find!"}
{"text":"Amazing blueberry bagels with tomato's, onions and alphafa sprouts. The customer service was delightful and can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I had a Gyro, it was just okay, but I had nothing else with it, and it cost way too much. The vast majority of the people who eat here do so, because its convenient to work, but they take advantage of it by having super high prices.

Then there's the service...the ladies on the registers are nice, but man does it take an exceptionally long time to get your food after it is ordered.

For that one gyro, it took nearly 30 minutes for me to get it, and I'm not exaggerating here. If they lowered the wait times here, I could somewhat forgive the high prices, but the service here is painfully slow.

Most people call ahead their orders, but I'm not going through all of that - I'm too busy at work for that. I'll bring my lunch or run up the street for something else, it'll be faster."}
{"text":"This place is in the office building next door to the preschool I work at. Very nice place, great dining area. lots of food choices. The only reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars is because it's a little bit on the pricey side. 

I had a Garden Salad and a Grape flavored G2 (Gatorade) for my lunch today, as it was my first time trying this place out and wanted something I knew I'd have the time to eat on my lunchbreak. The salad was really good and filling. I got my money's worth, that's for sure. 

I know I will return in the future, because the atmosphere is great, the dining area is very nice, and the workers there are friendly."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed.  My favorite - the Athens wrap (8.99 I think)  which is always enough for lunch and break.  Perfect blend of Mediterranean flavors. I also enjoy the $5.99 custom made pizzas.  I have also enjoyed the quick boiled egg or cheese stick (.50).  I only have a 30 minute lunch so having this so close by is a real treat.
The folks working in there are never on their phones or lazing around.  Great, personal service and always as quick as possible.
Oh - and I cannot forget the big homemade cookies - if you get there first thing in the morning they are even warm sometimes.  Don't eat them all!"}
{"text":"City Market Deli is a great place to grab your breakfast or lunch. It is adjoined to a Republic Services corporate location so most of the clientele are employees grabbing a quick bite for breakfast or sitting down for lunch. The place is run by a tight family and they are always conversational and friendly.

They have breakfast specials every morning, though I'd highly recommend getting the breakfast bagel for $5.99. They stuff the bagel with egg and cheese, a meat of choice, and other extras if you want, making for a hearty breakfast meal.

For lunch, try out the wide variety of sandwiches, wraps, hamburgers and hot dogs. They really have an option for everybody. You can upgrade your meal for a few bucks to get a drink and a side. I've only ever tried the potato salad as a side, but it's great.

If you're a Republic Services employee, you can get a full upgraded meal for just $5."}
{"text":"This is a \"LUNCH\" establishment. For those of us working non-traditional hours this isn't an option. Hours are 7a-5p yet the grill is shut off at 3:30pm. Don't bother calling in to get this information either, the customer service is horrible, just try asking their phone rep \"how are you today?\", show any concern, it doesn't matter. You're not worthy of respect from the person on the other end of the phone."}
{"text":"How can I be the first to review this awesome deli???  great food, great service, great owner and staff that is proud to deliver quality...the owner even made a point to know my name after 2nd visit.  Place is always busy but super fast.  The meatball sub is the best in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I'm glad this place is here.   The food is pretty varied and decent, and I'm glad its in the building.    Yeah, it might be a buck or two more than you think it should be, but considering the market their serving (an office building) I'll pay a little more for the convenience so I can get back to work and not have to drive somewhere else to eat. 

I like it (try the pastrami sandwitch)."}
{"text":"I'm very grateful to have an \"in-building\" cafe in my new work location (same job, different and upgraded building to work out of...), but it's nothing too spectacular. It's not horrible and it's not amazing either.

Slightly inflated prices - think $8-something for a mediocre quesadilla, fries and a small drink. Since there are a lot of ppl who visit for lunch (during 11am-1pm), it definitely takes longer for your order to be made - but you can call ahead!

They do offer \"grab-n-go\" options also, if you don't have the time to wait for your food to be cooked. Friendly owners and decent-sized menu options. Try the Athens Wrap (Greek-style chicken wrap)!"}
{"text":"The food is decent however the cost is too much. They wanted to charge me almost $8.00 for a non-meat ceaser salad. 
They close at 5PM however if you want anything from their grill you're shit out of luck after 3:30PM.  They shut the grill off 90 minutes before they close. Seriously??"}
{"text":"When I meet a friend who works at Skysong, we go here sometimes. It is HANDY as heck, walkable from all businesses/ASU departments. The food is always \"okay\", The bread is really doughy like a hot dog bun, even for their Italian sandwich. The side salads are okay. If you have time, go to Fate (which we did last time). The line here can get very long. There are spots outside to sit in a park like environment if that's your thing. Prices are a bit high $10 or so for a sandwich. But if you work here and didn't pack lunch it serves as your cafeteria. For that I bumped it to 3."}
{"text":"coffee. coffee coffee. coffee coffee coffee. 

Sandwiches are fine and stuff. I didn't mind my Italian style sandwich. They have smoothies. Advil and m&ms and nuts and Clif bars. The cashier is super chill. I've gotten a burger there before and it wasn't bad at all. They sell this tiny salad that I love in a to go container: a small bit of lettuce, several hard boiled eggs, and cheese cubes. Perfect snack of protein. 

also Starbucks coffee. 

Happy hour between 1-4pm. $1 off grande or venti lattes, cappuccinos, macchiatos, mochas, and frappucinos. 

Get back to work!"}
{"text":"Not at all impressed by this place. I see so many people going here for breakfast and lunch. I had a salad with chicken the first time I went here and the chicken was suspect. Although I have to say that I'm very picky with the meat I eat. Secondly, I went to this cafe about a week ago around 1:00, hoping to have missed the lunch rush and I waited for 15 minutes and no one ever came to take my order or even ask if I had been helped yet. I was hoping to frequent this place since my office is in the next building over but I guess not. Also, I was excited that they serve Starbucks coffee and tea here but every time I get a drink from here it is not very good. I paid $5.30 for a drink that I didn't enjoy. I'm sorry to say that I won't be going back to this place again.

I do have to say that I gave it 2 stars only because when I have been waited on, everyone was very nice and professional."}
{"text":"I'm always greeted with a smile and by my first name too! It's in the middle of skysong so the lunch rush is heavy but so worth the wait for their sandwiches!

Try the \"Liberty Bell\" today then try the \"California Dream\" tomorrow, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Early on, I asked City Market why they weren't on Yelp.  The immediate reply was, \"What is Yelp?\"  After trying to explain everything that Yelp is, I was given the brush off.  And now they are promoting some kind off Yelp wannabe.  Well, too bad City Market, I've added you to Yelp and this is your review.  I even added a business photo; it's not bad.

The sandwiches are good and there's a nice variety.  They run daily specials with a drink, and the menu is presented on flat screen TVs.  And not too long ago they dropped their prices.  Bores Head products are a big deal.   They also offer some convenience store items.  The main reason I go is because it is about forty feet from my office.  Everyone goes to City Market when time is short or they are being lazy.

City Market is located In SkySong, and isn't visible from the street.  Other than the denizens of SkySong, I wonder who else comes, especially with the delay of a page on Yelp."}
{"text":"Not a fan. I work within the same plaza and have been trying this place for 3 yrs. I don't go here very often due to the high prices and lack of customer service. I call to order ahead so I don't have to wait and even when its not a time that would be so busy like today I called at 2:15 and was on hold for 10 min. I hung up. This regularly happens. Or you go and stand at the counter waiting for one of the girls to take your order and they just sit and talk to each other and you have to wait for them to finish their conversation. Or another woman whose been working there a while seems mad or upset when you go its a downer. I refuse to spend money there unless its like the last resort. I will walk to the plaza across the street instead most of the time or bring my lunch. And since I waited on hold for 10 min I ordered food for delivery which is the same price after tip due to their high prices. The food is just ok. Fries taste grainy and oily after you eat a few. For a salad you pay over $9.00 for, which is crazy."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get lunch if you work in Camelback village. The owner remembers the repeat customer's names, they make good food, and the prices are reasonable. Overall always a great experience!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say but the food lacks flavor, it the equivalent of a greasy spoon, but worse. The owner treats his staff like slaves, all tips go to the owner and not the employees... Avoid this place"}
{"text":"If there was a way to give negative stars I'd do it.  Absolutely horrible service, food, and value. The staff is indifferent to the hordes of people waiting for service, and with the exception of Kim they act like they're doing you a favor.  I ordered a turkey & Swiss sandwich once and it was $8.99! 

Mornings they've got one miserable girl taking orders at a snails pace while another lady is making yuppie coffees. Expect to spend 20 minutes in line while Ms. Rainman figures out the register, and the other 2 registers sit idle. The lady making coffee is friendly and hustles, I'm not sure why she's not working with people. 

Do yourself a favor and walk across the street. Much better food at a better price."}
{"text":"Great local deli place I frequent often when in town. You can get great hit or cold sandwich's with chips and a drink for $10. They also have a great selection of wraps and salads. If you a pick me up they have all the caffeinated concoctions you can desire. Good, friendly and quick service. Family owned."}
{"text":"This place is in the same building as my office.  Everyone I work with loves this place!  Their food is great (I haven't heard one person complain about something they ordered), their customer service is awesome, and the place is really clean and convenient.  I hear them address just about everyone by first name, and they are such nice, friendly people!  They have hot and cold meals, quick pre-prepared things, all sorts of drinks, snacks, ice cream, and Starbucks.  The service is pretty fast too."}
{"text":"The Staff is awesome and always friendly. Go for the omelettes in the morning. Massive sandwiches for lunch. This is an office deli for tons of people, just go up to the counter and order. Someone else gave a low review because she sat to be waited on...there's 3 cash registers and this is a deli, just walk up and you'll be fine. There is Wi-Fi now also."}
{"text":"Reliably good for breakfast, lunch, coffee or catering. My favorite is the Chicago Dog - excellent! One time they even reheated food we had purchased from another caterer. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Really like this place a lot, staff is always so kind and remembers me by name. Never once had them mess up on an order, keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"if i could give this place negative stars i would! they can keep their over price crap food with roaches  in the restroom very gross! very rude staff and over price food! i just started wrkn near by and co-workers told me this place is good but over price and some co-workers told me this place makes them sick! with all that told, i still gave them a chance. i called and got nothing but attitude from a lady that answer the phone! i was told to make sure i know what i want b4 i called. i never eattin from here so i had questions about the menu then i get  attitude for that! idc how close this place is to work i wont ever call them and try to order again. if i had time i would protest outside this place to make sure everyone would know how horrible this place is with customer service.  the health department needs to look into this place and the management company of the building needs to look into their crap service they offer their tenants"}
{"text":"Mm mm good! I was very pleasantly surprised with how great the food here was. It was quite large with center pieces on each table, and a HUGE selection of sandwiches, salads, soups, burgers and more! They have a grab & go section with tabbouli, parfaits, and more. I had the Los Angeles wrap and my coworker had the Santa Fe sandwich. Everything was fresh and crisp...and the sandwiches are humongous! I could only finish half. I also had a cup of the chicken tortilla soup which was delicious. For having gourmet deli sandwiches, the prices are cheap! The best part about this place, they have a Starbucks inside as well!! The lady that took our order was so pleasant while offering suggestions, and the owner even came to our table while eating to make sure we were enjoying everything. I plan on coming here weekly!"}
{"text":"Super great burger, also have enjoyed the salads. Really nice staff, really great with my service animal and very wheelchair accessible.  Nice little place that has a great variety of snacks and breakfast/lunch foods. Large coffee bar selections. So cool! They even have Smart Water and other drink fridge selections, ice cream case, candy bars, and few little items for self care, like aspirin, etc. Little on the expensive side to me, wish it were a bit more competitive, definitely holds me back from going more, guess they capitalize on being in Skysong (captive audience ). Burger is great, that's for sure."}
{"text":"I work at Skysong & sometimes need to grab something quick and this is the closest option.  
Maybe I've been spoiled by true NY delis as I haven't found one place in the PHX/Scottsdale are that lives up to any sandwich I get in NYC but this place does have good soups, and a decent variety of items available.  The best part is the staff, very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I love this little place! Once Rhana knows your name, it feels like she's known you for life! Once I couldn't remember what my wife typically orders, but Rhana did!The food is great, and very convenient. Don't wanna leave your desk? They'll deliver!"}
{"text":"Nestled between the 101 fwy and the Talking Stick Resort, this mid sized restaurant recently opened in a small business park. This is kind of a big deal because of isolation and 30 min lunches.  In our building we only had what is comparable to vending machines, although they do have decent selections.  I decided to give this place a try and was disappointed.  I orderd the Classic Hot Pastrami and Swiss sandwich for $7.49, If I wanted the combo it would have be $9.49.  That is pretty expensive for a sandwich.  The vending machine in my bldg. sells a comparable one for almost $3.00 less.  I guess when you are being held hostage to a business that has no competition, money will be made.  I would feel differently if the sandwich tasted spectacular or the portion was larger.  I will not return...............................Not sure why your family would be here in a business park having lunch with you but ok! LOL!"}
{"text":"My buddies work @VIP mortgage. They are located on the 5th floor of one of the buildings and his whole crew go there all the time. I live across the street at the condos & I go here for coffee, lunch, and energy drinks! Love this place! Great place for lunch.... Especially if you live close!"}
