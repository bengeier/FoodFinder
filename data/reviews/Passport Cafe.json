{"text":"Full disclosure- the owners of Passport Cafe, Mark and his wife, are family friends.  This was enough to get us in the door of the restaurant the first time, but it is much more than this that has kept us coming back dozens and dozens of times.

I no longer live in the Pittsburgh suburbs but come back frequently to visit my family, and Passport Cafe is must-visit on every trip home.  I have had just about every type of food the restaurant has to offer- brunch, lunch, regular dinner, special event-dinners, Wednesday night ethnic theme dinners, etc.  We also had a large private party catered by Passport Cafe, and just like eating in the restaurant, the service, presentation, and most importantly THE FOOD was wonderful.  As previous reviews have said, this restaurant is especially unique compared to the Wexford-area strip mall regulars of chain restaurants and sub shops.  The food is fresh, locally sourced, often organic, frequently experimental and always delicious.  

The wine list is updated frequently and covers a nice range.  The risotto of the day changes as its name states and is consisently yummy.  The impromptu cheese plate we once requested from the chef was one of my favorite things I've had- the bliss is in the details and special touches here.  Even with all this, the dessert menu remains my favorite part of Passport Cafe- the pastry chef on staff is extremely talented!"}

{"text":"I live in Boston, and every time I come home to the suburbs for a family visit, I secretly dread the food.  My mom's home cooking is, of course, excellent, but everything in a 30 minute radius is just...not...great.  It's all giant pepper grinders and quantity over quality in the North Hills, it seems.  I heard about the Passport Cafe through a friend and finally got around to trying it tonight.  

It is fantastic.  The ambiance is warm and glowing.  The food is absolutely delicious - locally grown and organic.  I personally tried:  the Lamb Sliders appetizer (I think the fries had truffle oil!), the Poached Pear with Goat Cheese, the Red Pepper Bisque soup, and the Bronzino - Mediterranean roasted sea bass with melty goat cheese stuffed artichokes.  Prices are affordable, service is attentive but not -Too- attentive, and Mark Matera, the owner, is truly welcoming.  I am usually not this effusive about a restaurant, but I would be about this place, even if it wasn't such a rare gem.  I wish they would open one in Boston!"}

The Passport Cafe is a breath of fresh air and a glimpse into the world of global cuisine which is welcome in an area saturated with Starbucks coffee.

Owner Mark Matera opened the Passport Cafe this past Friday in his hometown of Wexford. The first weekend brought in over 200 people with no advertising. 

Matera works with local Wexford farms such as Kaelin's, Soergel's, and Eichner's as well as Pittsburgh's La Prima Espresso to craft his unique menu. 

The Pork Osso Bucco melted off the bone and had an amazingly distinct flavor which complimented the richness of the risotto perfectly. Other menu offerings include a Fried Green Tomato Salad with baby spinach, bacon vinaigrette, and goat cheese as well as a Porchetta Italian Ham sandwich with Brie and apples on a baguette. 

Passport Specialties include Duck Cassoulet with white beans and tomato cream and the ultimate comfort food, Meatloaf with roasted tomato basil coulis served with Porcini macaroni and cheese. 

The desert menu boasts a delicate hazelnut pastry topped with tofu ice cream and caramel sauce. 

The prices of the menu are incredibly reasonable and there is also a children's menu offering. 

Chef Shawn Carlson has been around the Pittsburgh restaurant circuit and said he was frustrated with the lack of passion people had in the food industry. Carlson said a restaurant must embody passion in every aspect including service, atmosphere, presentation, and food quality. 

Carlson opened up the kitchen of the previous restaurant and added a chef's table. The dining area reflects gentle shades of blue and brighter light fixtures. The intricate garden-like patterns on the walls were all hand painted. 

Carlson does not have to worry about expressing his passion for the restaurant to a new client; Passport Cafe Matre d' David welcomes diners to the breezy restaurant and exudes an aura of energy which is extremely contagious. Before the customer even tastes the wine, they are transported to the south of France and feel a crisp fall breeze as they sense the aromas of incredible cuisine. 

The Passport Cafe plans to have tasting events in the future and continues to craft the perfect Sunday Brunch, served until 3:00."}
