{"text":"Awesome view. Good food. But horrible service. The restaurant had no more than 7 tables sat. There was a ton of employees working and service was still slow."}
{"text":"Love coming to this Fridays during the week for lunch. Nice to chill out and look out over the field. Fast service and good food!"}
{"text":"Really cool place. The food was alright. My friend had the Jack Daniel's ribs and I had the Jack Daniel's burger and a salad. Typical \"Friday's\" type food, nothing special but not bad. 

The view is awesome, though. We went and had no idea that it was IN the stadium itself with a view of the field. We went after the game was over and there was plenty of seating. I'd probably come here again or on a game day, though it's a little more because you pay for the table (50% of it goes towards your food costs though!)"}
{"text":"The potato skins we're just a slice of Cheddar and two pieces of Bacon. We had to move seats just because of the waiter. Even though we were one of the only people in thr place.The beer taps were nasty and if you got the unlimited apps you couldnt share. Oh and did I mention that there was no baseball game going on?"}
{"text":"While the food and atmosphere were great, our waiter was anything but. From the minute we were seated Matt, was awful and rude. When we asked if we could separate checks, he replied, \" I don't play that game.\" When one person was using the restroom, he refused to take out order because he has to start at the left of the table to take orders, he couldn't possibly skip him, and get his order when he returned to the table. Matt said, \" this is going to cost you fifteen minutes. \" When I asked him to please stop being so rude, he said, \"I'm you waiter, you'll have to deal with it.\" We had 11 people in our party, and 3 orders were wrong. This was terrible service, if it wasn't such am amazing place to eat, while looking over the ball field, we would never return because of Matt."}
{"text":"We arrived around 3:30 to eat before Monster Jam, we were seated right away which was nice, however we were not offered outside seating overlooking the field. No big deal we didn't ask for it. We sit down and probably 10 minutes passed and finally someone comes to take our drink order. Another 5-10 minutes passed and we get our drinks and have to ask to place our food order, judging by the service so far its going to be a long time before we get any food so we want to get the process going. I ordered the boneless buffalo wings with a side of fries, my husband orders the ribs, and we got the chicken tenders for our son. The boneless wings were gross, not even warm and not even really reheated all the way, not very saucy almost like a dry rub with a splash of sauce. The fries were good. My husbands ribs were alright, however the waitress didn't come back to check on us until we were done eating. So I snacked on wings I didn't even really want. We couldn't get anymore sauce or a wet nap for my husband to wipe his hands on so he instead had to take off to the bathroom to wash his hands. My husbands decides to order a beer and asks what size the \"tall one\" was, the waitress doesn't know a size but points to someone's glass and says \"that size right there\" so my husbands said he would take one, when it finally comes it doesn't come in a glass but rather a disposable cup, he asked why it was in that and not a glass and he informed him they were \"out of glasses\" 

Probably 5 minutes after the waitress drops the check off (the quickest she has came back the entire time we have been there) she comes back and asks us if she can move us to a table outside and mentions how our son will be able to overlook the field if we move out there. NOTE: they have tables inside overlooking the field that say 1 hour maximum sitting time, we WERE NOT at these tables but rather the ones in the back of the restaurant that have no sign with a time limit posted. She also tells us how we can take our sons leftovers and our drinks to go and they will let us bring them in the stadium downstairs. We agree and I go ahead and go out to the outside area while my husbands waits for our to go drinks and a box. I no more then set our stuff down and the hostess comes overs and tells me that we CANNOT sit at those tables and acts like she has no idea why my waitress had told me we could sit there and like I was crazy, then she proceeds to tell us there are stadium chairs out there on their patio that we can sit in but we can't sit at the tables. At this point i'm annoyed because our waitress had kicked us out of our table only to get sent outside to find out we couldn't sit out there either. We take a seat in two of these stadium chairs on their patio and sit there for probably about 10 minutes until a security guard comes and tells us those are ticketed chairs and we can't sit there either. At this point we are more then ready to leave and never come back. When we are leaving there are people waiting all over. I felt bad that they were waiting that long for bad food and bad service, which is the only reason I am even writing a bad review.

Once we get back downstairs and try to go in with our to-go stuff that we were told we could bring in we are told we cannot bring in the iced tea in the to go cup because it doesn't say TGI Fridays on the cup even though everything else we had clearly said it and we had just came out of the exit. 

Overall we were very disappointed by not only poor food but also poor service and lack of communication amongst the staff members."}
{"text":"Unique location inside Chase Field where the local Arizona Diamondbacks call home. Set-up like a regular TGI Fridays with a modified seating format with many of the seats that overlook the field. I was there for an event on a non-baseball game night, and it was just kinda strange to be in a stadium, in the dark, with no game going on. But food was as would be expected and service was pleasant. Worth checking out once."}
{"text":"Sat for 20 minutes and no one came over. Keep in mind is was not busy at all. Got up and contacted someone to help. He went to find someone to help us. Someone came out who knew nothing of menu or drink selection. After struggling to take our drink order, we questioned the management. Two minutes later, a table sat behind us and the guy who \"went to find our waiter\" was at the table behind us instantly. Good for the new customers, but this showed they did not care about serving us. Needless to say we left, luckily before giving them a dime!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience.  We took into consideration this is a venue that at pre-game becomes overwhelmed with an influx of customers in a short period of time.  However that does not excuse the staff for putting a table of 2 on a waiting list only to forget about them for 45 minutes while tables are cleared and other guests are seated.  When we went back to check the status, the response was \"oops, sorry your information was not transferred from the iPad\" (apparently there was some type of technology glitch).  The response was then that we would be next, so let the wait begin some more.  When our pager did activate, we were given an option to have a view (which would require an additional wait) or be seated immediately.  We stated we would like a view but as we had now been waiting for nearly an hour didn't want to have another unreasonable wait for the view.  Apparently that response translated into \"seat these 2 in the darkest corner of the restaurant with absolutely no chance of even a glimpse of the field\".   After we were seated and realized that we could now be sitting inside any other TGIFridays (surrounded by solid red walls) the other guest in my party then returned to the hostess stand to inquire if maybe a better table with a view was coming available as we were celebrating a birthday (we did not use this line to play on sympathies, it was a birthday occasion - not that it mattered because there were no sympathies).  The hostess then said she would come find us and knew where we were currently seated, only to never be seen or heard from again.  The unapologetic attitude, the unwillingness to make reparations for an obvious oversight and error on the staff's part, and the poor food quality have me hoping this place closes their doors as so many other TGIFridays across the Valley already have and will hopefully be reopened by a restaurateur that knows customer service, food quality, and overall restaurant management (my vote - Four Peaks!).  

As far as the food is concerned, it is what you would expect from a mass produced, crowd fulfillment perspective.  I sympathize with the cooks that are trying to appease the masses, but during our extended wait period we had the opportunity to watch customer after customer complain about the food quality and send items back (in particular there seemed to be an overall dislike for the burgers, which appeared to be frozen meat slabs with no originality to the toppings that would have at least helped to mask the gray color and rubbery texture - yuck)"}
{"text":"Located inside the Diamondbacks baseball park. I was surprised that it was open during the off season but I learned it's a locals favorite and I can see why. There were around 40 people inside before the Suns game. Upon the suggestion of a \"local regular\" we had the Nachos as the appetizer. Great choice! Crisp, hot, full of meat and guac. and no chip goes with a dip  & Real Cheese-they don't use the cheap fake cheese sauce like other restaurants near the stadium. My husband ordered the Jack Daniels Rib Eye med. rare and was very pleased because it was cooked perfect with wonderful flavor & the corn bread was outstanding (addictive). I ordered the Bruschetta Chicken Pasta and it was also wonderful with very tender chicken but could have used a bit more sauce. For Drinks the draft beer selection was very weak, we were disappointed they didn't offer any local craft beer only Sam Adams. My husband was forced to go with a Stella due to no other choices and I had a pleasant but bland J. Lohr Cabernet Sauvignon. The staff was GREAT - the bartender cracked funny jokes that made the crowd laugh and our waitress was cheerful and very attentive. Great Service! Oh, and ATT wifi is availble free with no password from the ballpark. I can see why the locals are a fan, this is the best service I've received in the legends neighborhood. it will definitely be one of my local hangouts."}
{"text":"My wife and I and another couple went to the D'back game on Mothers Day. After arriving we all decided to go to Friday's Front Row because we were hungry and thought it would be better than the concession food.

We found a table in the bar area and were ready to sit when my wife noticed a little larger table close by, so we took that one. The waitress (Bridgette) was quick to give us out menus and quick to take our order since we were ready to order our food when she came to ask what we wanted to drink.

I was pleased because I wanted to watch the game from our seats instead of the restaurant and I thought everything was working out to make that happen -but BOY, was I wrong! Somehow our table must have disappeared into the Twilight Zone. I say that because we did not even SEE our waitress for a long time. Another waitress came by and told us she would be right with us and I explained we had already placed our orders and were still waiting for our drinks to come. She said she would see if she could help us. Finally (soon after we had spoken to the second waitress) our waitress showed up with our drinks (2 beers and 2 sodas) - MORE THAN 20 MINUTES AFTER INITIALLY PLACING THE ORDER!  Bridgette thanked us for waiting patiently for our drinks and I said we waited, but patiently was not the word I would use. I then asked about our food order and explained we were hungry and that the people who had taken the table we almost took when we had come in arrived about 10 minutes after us and were already eating their food. Bridgette said she would check on it.

We did not see her again until she brought our food out with a helper about 10 minutes later. My first thought was that she had forgotten to place the order and had done it when she had brought our drinks - but NO! The chicken appetizer my wife ordered was barely warm. The other woman in our party had ordered cheese sticks - and the inside was just warm. My buddy's burger and mine were warm - not hot and our fries were only luke warm. So it appears the order was placed, but sat in the kitchen and was not brought to our table in a timely manner. 

Needless to say - I was not happy! It was the end of third inning when we finally made it to our seats. The food was disappointing and the service was horrible. I will NEVER eat there again and will tell everyone I know just how terrible this restaurant experience was for me. ZERO stars descibes this place the best. And this experience makes me wish we had eaten the concession food...."}
{"text":"I am from out of town and have never been to a restaurant at a ball game, so I was excited to go to Front Row to watch the DBacks game. The website gave very conflicting messages about when you could purchase the seats in Front Row for the game, so I gave the restaurant a call over a week in advance. They said I could only purchase tables the day of. I called the night before the game, hoping that maybe they would make an exception because I really wanted these tickets. I then found out that the tickets have been available all season! I asked to speak to the manager, who was the rudest human being I have ever spoke to in my life! After about an hour on the phone with him, tears, and being called a liar, I decided to hang up and just call customer service. I understand that the table I wanted had already been reserved, I just wanted the manager (Lyle) to try to help fix the issue. He said there was nothing he could do, and that \"EVERYONE knows you can buy the tickets all year round\"... what a piece of crock. I cannot believe I was talked to in the way that he spoke to me, and I am so thoroughly upset and aggravated at him. I just read some previous reviews about him on this site, and it's so funny that everyone agrees with me. If you don't have any issue when you go there, then you'll be fine. But if you have even the slightest complaint that has to go through Lyle.... don't expect to leave happy."}
{"text":"Me and four others came here during a game and got tickets for the table seats outside. This meant we were ordering off the game day menu. As far as appetizers, the buffalo wings were the only thing worth ordering again. We got the mozzarella cheese sticks which weren't anything special and the Jack Daniel's chicken strips which were more of chicken bits. The pieces were so tiny and covered such a small portion of the small plate they were brought on. Next, we got our food. My dad got a half rack of ribs and they looked small, although the flavor was there, the portion was not. He also got the Jack Daniel's burger (his usual at any Friday's restaurant) and said that it was not as good as it has been at other TGIFs. An item three of us wanted was the Southwest Chicken Sandwich made in buffalo sauce. This was an option on the menu that came at no additional charge; however, when we ordered it our waiter said we weren't able to get it this way because it wasn't apart of the game day menu. Yet, when we looked at the cover of our menus (which had the option in it) it said \"game day menu\". She did get us a side of buffalo sauce, but it was frustrating and made the burger significantly messier.

Overall the food was alright but lacking in a lot of ways. There is definitely better food in the area that would be worth getting."}
{"text":"This place was awesome and if you are a baseball or diamondbacks fan, and you like fridays, you will be in heaven. I had the Chicken and Cheese plate, got more than enough food, and had excellent service. The view of the field is amazing, and I highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Got kicked out of Fridays First Row! What a bunch of pieces of craps! We only had 2 rounds of drinks there, we weren't being loud or obnoxious, the place was practically empty and the manager couldn't give us a satisfactory answer as to why we were being dismissed. The only thing he kept repeating was \"I have to back his bartenders.\" WTF?! It's cool to have a manager to back you up like this but c'mon guy! YOU didn't even notice anything out of the ordinary from our group, you were right there!!! WE WERE NOT DRUNK OR LOUD! 

Even thought that was our last drink there, it still pissed us off. Needless to say, they didn't deserve a tip and we took our business to a place that appreciates having a good group of day drinkers at their empty establishments on a slow Saturday afternoon. In downtown Phoenix, it wasn't hard to find the next spot...

*** Da Bafroom: Sorry folks, we were not there long enough to make this visit.  But I'm sure it stinks just as bad as the serivce we got though!"}
{"text":"Just leaving feeling very disappointed as Fridays used to be one if my favorite places.  Tuesday evening, no customers just my husband, son and I, a waitress, bartender and two chefs.  Service was slow, won tons looked like pork skins, parmesan chicken super buttery, overcooked and resembled popcorn chicken."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!. Sad to see one of my favorite regular lunch spots do a 180 and totally suck. Went a couple weeks ago shortly after 11:00 and the restaurant looked empty, yet a couple groups of six in front of us and our group of four were told it would be a 20 minute wait because they weren't staffed yet. WTF? We all left and took a short walk to Coach's Corner (my new favorite). Thought I'd give Friday's a another try today at lunch, don't want to burn myself out on coach's corner. Not real busy inside. Waiter tried to sit us at a table that was in the sun. My buddy and I balked. We asked for a table where we wouldn't totally bake, like more in the shady bar area. He told us that he couldn't guarantee that we'd get good service there. Again, we were like WTF? He said the bartender wasn't in yet, or the 2nd bartender wasn't in. His attitude was fairly arrogant. It almost appears like they've totally given up on the lunch crowd. I hope this review spares somebody the frustration that I've dealt with the last couple times I tried to eat there. I just tried to contact someone via their website but doesn't look like they want to hear about it. You CAN contact them about reserving tables for an event. Like I'd really want to do that now. Way too many places downtown now where your patronage will be appreciated."}
{"text":"Alright I don't know if it's because i'm a huge baseball fan or what but I absolutely loved this place. 

If you're going to eat here make sure you sit outside, if not be near a window where you can see the baseball field. If you can go when a Arizona Diamondbacks game is going on I would highly recommend it, and even if there isn't a game going on just sitting over left field and being in the ball park makes it all worth while.

The food was delicious. The fries were well seasoned and the triple decker reuben I ordered really hit the spot. The appetizer we had was a \"loaded nachos\" type deal with thick crispy potato chips instead of the traditional tortilla chips. Very good for an appetizer..especially during happy hour!

I would suggest this restaurant to anyone who is a baseball fan..however if you're really just in it for the food it's just another TGIF's (not that that's a bad thing!)"}
{"text":"A complex calculation goes in to my three star rating of Front Row, and while I don't have enough space here to fully explain the algorithms, allow me to try to summarize:

- It's a Friday's, with all attendant Friday's food and drink-- on its own a one star rating.

- It's got a bar that's stocked with sort of standard booze and pours pretty weak drinks, but does have numerous TV's, so you can catch a number of different games-- on its own a two and a half star rating.

-It's located in a major league baseball stadium-- on its own a five star rating.

-The baseball stadium in question, Chase Field (forever the BOB in my mind) is a representative of all the crappy new mall-like baseball parks that have insisted on sprouting up over the last 15+ years-- on its own a two star rating 

- Phoenix, of all places, has a pretty good weather-related excuse for a mall-like structure in which to house its baseball-- uping the rating in the previous point to three stars.

- Front Row is open year round, so even if you're never in Phoenix during the regular season you still have an opportunity to at least get a sense of the BOB-- once again a five star rating.

All in all, props to Front Row for allowing us spring visitors a unique opportunity to see the field at the Ides of March. If only they could do something about the watered-down drinks, overly salted food, and unappealing menu items, this would be an excellent stop for those inclined to work baseball in to their lives whenever possible. As is, its worth the trip, just for the haunting experience of standing on the balcony in the middle of the night, watching the groundscrew work under kleig lights to prepare the turf for opening day."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service today.  There was a bartender by the name of Matt that was rude over and over again.  Didn't want to answer any questions, didn't offer any suggestions for a menu item taken off the ever changing menu. This guy was so bold while another table and I were talking about his horrible attitude he walked by with a smirk on his face. Then while I was talking to his manager he walked by and laughed... I was left speechless.  

I can't believe I drive all the way from Chandler in rush hour to eat here and received this type of service, really.  I have had better service at Denny's. 

TGIF is a large resturant chain and should invest a little to bring in servers on the off season before 5pm or at least have more bartenders like Doug that actually treat their customers decent and can have a smile on their face. 

Found out about a new job offer before walking in the door and then to be treated rude the whole time just killed my whole vibe.  A free desert didn't make this a better experience.  I'm beginning to see why there is only one TGIF'S left in Arizona. Especially, after a roach ran across my daughters table a couple months ago while on a date, smh. I have it another shot but don't even know if I will cone back to use all those rewards points.....sad face.."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! 
We entered Fridays one hour before the D-Backs game. We went into the bar and found two open bar tables. Before sitting down we asked a waiter if the table was available. He said yes, and we sat down. No one came to take our order for 10 minutes so we went to the bar and ordered drinks. A waiter came by after we received our drinks and gave us menus. Another waiter came by with more menus. After we had been at the table for 20 minutes, a hostess came over to say the table was reserved for the wait list and we had to move - the other table that was open when we came in was still open and there were at least eight tables open in the dining area. We told the hostess that a waiter told us we could sit there and she said it didn't matter. We asked for the manager. He reiterated that we had been told by a waiter that we could sit there, he didn't care. We asked if we could finish our drinks, since the other bar table was still vacant. He said no. We had to finish our drinks standing to the side of the bar (since you can't take them into the stadium). The table we were evicted from was never cleared or seated and when we left there was no wait list for seating."}
{"text":"Go when there is not a game for great service and a great view of the stadium. 

Or

Go when there is a game for food and tickets combined into a pretty good price."}
{"text":"I have been here twice in three months and I live in Flagstaff. Always a great experience, great food, great service!"}
{"text":"This place is probably like any other Friday's you've visited. BUT (and this is a huge but) you have a great view of Chase Field. The crowds are big before a Dbacks game, but you can try skipping the cue and find a spot in the bar. I always have a couple of beers before a game and really enjoy the experience, specially if you want to see your favorite players during the pre-game batting practice. There is an annoying time limit on the tables with field-view, but it's probably for the best."}
{"text":"Typical Friday's food that is consistent and satisfies.  But if you have friends in from out of town and you want an impressive place to eat, this is eat.  You overlook Chase Field for the entire meal.  Make sure you don't go during gametime as it's a mob scene, but all other times, Great!"}
{"text":"We walked in on 6/3/2016 10 minutes before closing. The bartender (who was unbelievably drunk, slurring swaying, and red glassed over eyes) instructed us they had closed 50 minutes before. Meanwhile, 4 tables are sitting and a server is walking out with fresh made food. 

This is not a mom and pop shop that closes when its slow. Their hours are until 10, the bartender simply didn't want to serve us when we would have been quick to order and quick to leave. Probably because he was drunk as can be, which is incredibly unprofessional, let alone illegal.

This double standard makes me never want to go there again. I don't care how amazing the view of the baseball field is, its not enough to bring me back.

Their are other options, like hard rock cafe."}
{"text":"A chain but a most unusual one, at least in this particular location. That's because this one is located right in the stands of the baseball stadium! Seriously, you're right there and it would be a great place to watch the game. 

I suppose you could have your dishes shattered by a foul ball or something. But OH what a story to tell that would be!!!

Came in for lunch with a couple of coworkers one day, and there was no game on. The TGIF menu is the standard, familiar one. I went with a relatively new dish called Korean Steak Tacos. They were good, pretty well seasoned. Not as good as you'd get at a Mexican restaurant, but hey! It's Friday's!

Service here is impeccable and the view great. It's still a chain, but if you're going to hit a Fridays, this is the one. It almost feels like it's NOT a chain."}
{"text":"Thank god the view is nice.. That is all this place has going for it. We are season ticket holders and rather than going to our usual pre-game happy hour place we decided to try out this Fridays.. We won't be back. The host/hostess' were awesome. They seemed organized and were friendly. Once we got seated we saw the table tent that stated there is a 1 hour time limit so we got down to business. We all ordered a beer as soon as we were greeted by our server in which we waited 10 minutes for. We ordered an appetizer (the pretzels, which were hot and really pretty good) then ordered our food. I asked for the servers opinion between two dishes in which she replied she hadn't tried either. So I went with the pulled pork( usually a safe bet) then we waited.. And waited and waited some more.. Watched 4 or 5 tables that had sat after us get their food then we waited a little more. After about 35 minutes we finally had our food. It was Luke warm.. And I had asked for fresh jalapeños in which I was given fried.. I am a waitress at another restaurant and I'm not one to complain but if there is going to be a time limit on the tables I'd hope the food would come out in a timely matter and would have hoped the server would seem to care. She often disappeared and when we finally were finished waiting she informed us that we had about 10 minutes left on our hour limit. We took our check and I noticed the receipt had a survey on it. When she brought me my check back the receipt with the survey was gone. I asked where it went and she wasn't sure. She went and pulled it out of the garbage and gave it back to us nice and crumpled. These servers seemed burned out. They need some new energetic fresh faces in this place. It has so much potential!"}
{"text":"My husband's parents took us here for his birthday and we all had a great time. We sat on the patio which is a must. You get a great view of the field and much better--and cheaper--food than you'd get in the ballpark. The cheaper drinks are reason enough to visit this place. 

I had the Jack Daniels ribs and they were great. Everyone enjoyed their food which came out quickly despite a large crowd on the patio. The drinks were the best part. it's nice to be able to watch a baseball game with a pint of Guinness or a mojito instead of semi-cold overpriced beer. 

The best part of going on your birthday is that they skip the annoying song on the patio but still bring you a free dish of ice cream."}
{"text":"This place was awesome are food was great and we had a great time but the only down fall was they got mixed up on are bills and double charge us and it took almost a week to get my money no cool at all I so I know next time if I go back again I will not be using my card cash only because that was an inconvenience for me and keep in limbo"}
{"text":"Now THIS is the way to see a baseball game.  You are sectioned high above the actual field, so you get a decent view of everything going on, your own waitress, food/drinks and REAL PLATES.  LOL.  

Seriously though, for a special event or if you wanna have a decent TGIF meal while watching a game, it's a good time.

The prices are WAY inflated, as to be expected but again, totally a good time."}
{"text":"I had the steak and lobster tail - had to send the steak back because it was not the temperature I requested. It was hold when it came back, too much sugar in the sauce too, I gad an empty most of the lunch so service was pretty bad too"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying what an awesome concept this is! Sit at a restaurant table overlooking a ball game?! Yes please! 
When you book a table and tickets here you must meet a food and drink minimum, which wasn't an issue. Somewhat because we eat and drink a lot and somewhat because they have incredibly inflated prices. I guess this is par for a ballpark, though, so I will let this slide.
The menu was limited and had zero vegetarian entrees. So I got a chicken salad sans chicken and potato skins sans bacon. No price reduction for doing so.
They had a decent variety of liquor, wine and beer available. The food was \"okay\". Nothing that makes it memorable by any means. Service was nice (be forewarned your tip IS included and they will not tell you this). I don't enjoy that. *If the server actually tells me this, I always tip them extra for honesty. 
We had a nice evening and enjoyed ourselves! We would do this again for sure, however mainly for the experience. Not the food or service. 
(FYI tables only seat 4 or 6)."}
{"text":"4 stars because it's the standard regular priced menu even during the game! The best eating at the game (besides the bacon wrapped corn dog, but that's 25 bucks). The jack Daniels burger was great. The most food I was gonna get for 14 bucks at the game."}
{"text":"Fridays at a ballpark. Typical Friday menu. Giant beers. Prices are actually pretty good considering you'll get less quality for a higher price at the park."}
{"text":"What a great venue and view !  This place could make for a awesome fan experience.  However, the inexperienced servers and rude management staff left it as just a \"I have had better\" memory."}
{"text":"It was our server's last day at the restaurant. His attention and professionalism was awful until we asked if he was having a busy night... Nope. Just his last night  working and not giving af about his tables. Table wasn't wiped down, 10 minutes for our drinks, 20+ for our food, and it was cold... Just bad luck with this assigned server. If I was the management instead of socializing with the server I would have sent him home."}
{"text":"this is a great place to get your start your pre-game primer action !!  great view of the field and fair prices on drinks as apposed to the stick up bandits inside chase field juicing you for $11.00 hard earned dollars for a 24 OZ. beer.  love this place!!"}
{"text":"I actually really dig this place. We've gone back a few times since I checked in and it always surprises me. The view is amazing, even when there isn't a game and I'd highly recommend coming here if you're trying to impress the person you're with visually or especially for those out of town folks who want to see what Phoenix has to offer. The atmosphere is highly satisfying and the TGIFridays fare is exactly what you'd expect. I took a star off because the only thing lacking here is service. It's been hit or miss with a great waiter once and a terrible combination of waiters the second time; we had to ask 3 times to two different people just to get water, and we were seriously parched. However they DID discount our appetizer even though we ordered it after 7pm (by about 5 minutes but still) and that helped. If you're new to town or just have never been, this is a place you have to go at LEAST once."}
{"text":"Do. Not. Do it. Saturday night game, no reservation. Our wait was 35min. First off, there isn't anywhere to wait. If you hover along the wall up top, you're told to move because it's a fire hazard. There's no where to wait down below between the elevators, restrooms and security screening. There are NO benches or chairs. The hostesses and waiters were all under 25. I don't like to prejudice but in this case, they need adult guidance. It was a mess, with zero organization. Our waiter tried (AJ) but ended up abandoning us when it came time to pay the bill. We waited over 15min for him to return with our receipt. Food was decent. FYI it isn't the full Friday's menu so some favorites are missing. Management needs to fix the front end, and maybe we'll eat here again"}
{"text":"First time at this location.  Parking down town was a challenge , I first thought we could Park on the street but there were signs asking for a special permit . The restaurant was very slow maybe 4 tables.  Service was slow which did not make sense . The prices were reasonable and portions were large . We love their jack Daniel barbecue.  The ribs were delicious."}
{"text":"Just a typical Friday's inside Chase Field. Today we put in our name, gave them our phone number but we never received a text that they were ready for us."}
{"text":"This is just a standard TGI fridays rebranded for the baseball park.  That being said, we no longer have TGI fridays in Hawaii, so the food was a new experience for me.  I went on a Monday at noon, so as expected, there was not many people.  We were able to sit by the windows that overlook the park, which was breathtaking to me.  (Dont have a professional baseball stadium in Hawaii either) 

So, in terms of the food, my Auntie and Grandparents got the endless lunch.  Around $7-8 I think.  It came with Unlimited Breadsticks, soup and salad.  Only bad thing is that the French Onion is a one-order soup, and not unlimited without a small charge.  Thats bad because I absolutely LOVE french onion soup.  But my Grandparents and Auntie loved their food.  

I had the Korean Beef tacos.  Love it.  Good flavor, and rather large portion.  (TIP from my Auntie, ask for potsticker sauce on the side and pour it on the rice and/or tacos) 

The customer service was great, our waitress was super friendly and conversational.  Since it was pretty much empty, we walked outside to look at the stadium from the balcony they have.  While we did that, another employee got confused and cleared away our drinks and utensils.  Our waitress noticed before we came back and replaced it all.  She also took our picture outside for us.  Shame I dont remember her name to give her recognition on here. 

Overall, 

Food- 9/10
Price: 7.5/10
Location- 10/10
Customer Service: 20/10

The food and everything else was great, but it was the waitresses customer service that absolutely put it over the top."}
{"text":"Happy Hour ALL.  Great place even with no game in the park!  Staff was very nice and accommodating. Nice and reasonable in downtown Phoenix ."}
{"text":"ALWAYS FUN at Chase Field. $2 hot dogs, $2 pop corn all served in the coolness of air conditioned comfort

COME ON DOWN !!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and caught the game both times.  We sat out on the balcony.  The beauty of it is that 50% of the ticket price comes back in food credit.  The catch is you have to purchase the table.  We bought 4 tickets for $300 total and got $150 in food.  Let me tell you that is quite a bit of food.  The game day menu is not the full menu but you can still get burgers, steak, ribs, and chicken.  The food prices are comparable to any other TGIF but the cocktails are pretty over priced.  $10 for a 16 oz plastic glass of something.  My wife had a frozen margarita and it tasted funny.  

My steak was decent.  I wanted medium rare and it was cooked more than that.  The service was really slow.  I get the fact that the servers are moving up and down stairs trying to get everyone their stuff.  It was quite a bit of time between refills and the food did not all come out at once.  Actually we had to remind whomever it was that brought out the food several times of things that were missing.  Our actually waitress did not bring us much of our requests.  It was my wife's birthday and this was what she wanted to do.   Personally I prefer to sit out in the crowd in the bleachers and whoop and holler.  

The one really cool thing about it all was that we paid $300 for 4 tickets but after looking at the website again it clearly stated that the table was $260 for the 4 tickets.  After a couple of e-mails back and forth to the manager they offered $40 food credit or offered to credit the $40 back to my card.  They said it would have to be on the night of the event because the computer wouldn't allow them to do it.  The manager walked up to me and gave me $40 cash to make up for the difference.  That was really cool.  

Overall if it is something you have never done then it is worth checking out.  The be served throughout the game is cool.  The service could stand to be quicker, more accurate, and better organized.  I would do it again but it is not the seats of personal choice."}
{"text":"This is a great place to bring friends and family who are visiting from out of town. The food is just your basic TGIF and not really worth writing about. Most of the time I'll just grab a tall beer (usually Kiltlifter) and walk out and sit in the outfield to check out the stadium and talk with friends. I've always had good service and the place is nice and clean. I still haven't seen a game from the restaurant... gonna have to add that to the bucket list."}
{"text":"I hosted a business exchange in their two private rooms a few weeks ago and was so impressed with the staff and the service they provided.  We had a great event and all of my guests loved the location!  Everything was set-up as it should be and the food was put out exactly on time.  The bartenders were great and kept everyone happy!"}
{"text":"I had hands down the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. From the bad service to the bad manners. I was checked up on twice because the server was too busy watching the tv. My order was put in wrong my bun was rock solid, and it was cold. One employee was walking around aimlessly while slapping a waitresses ass in front of customers. On top of everything three different employees had colds and not once did they cover their mouths of make any attempt to while coughing. I've been in multiple times and I was severely disappointed. Don't plan on returning. And just in case the server gets to read this, I stole your pen. You don't deserve such a fine writing utensil."}
{"text":"I found the service, food, and environment very fun and enjoyable.  What a neat view to watch the maintenance people get the ballfield ready for tonight's D-Back game.  A fun Friday lunch with the girls."}
{"text":"Do not order the chicken nachos.  Awful!!!"}
{"text":"Food is basic chain food-nothing special but the service is horrific!  Went to dinner during a ballgame and could not get basic service even though it was not crowded.  They could have twice the bill if the servers stopped by once in a while. I will never go again. Next time I will eat before the game or in the ballpark. Don't waste your money with this place. Very disappointing considering our bill was 75 each times 5 people. Very bad experience."}
{"text":"Food is average, but the view is breathtaking for a baseball fan. I've visited 3 times (every time I'm in town) for dinner when no one is on the field . Pretty serene sight to see. You can even go outside the restaurant and take some closer photos from the seats. Definitely try the pink punk martini. Fun use of cotton candy in a cocktail."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!! Emberrassing we were celebrating a birthday for our out of town nephew."}
{"text":"Moths in beer and highly priced burgers. We had a coupon for free appetizer and once they took it out of the bill it was only two bucks off! How in the world an $8 coupon for being in their reward becomes two dollars off. Had a better time at other eateries. Definitely not worth the drive or the food."}
{"text":"Our server Doug was awesome. We are fans of the opposing team and he still treated us well. The drinks were good and service was excellent. Thanks Doug!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in before entering the ball park. Jasmine was our hostess and was able to seat our party in the ticketed seats during batting practice. Angela was our waitress and she was personable and amazing! Over all It was an awesome experience. We were very satisfied! 

Thank you for going above and beyond!"}
{"text":"This review is for the service (or complete lack of, I should say), not the food because we never got that far. We are visiting for Spring Training and thought this would be a fun place to take the kids. What a joke. The place was not busy at all. Empty tables everywhere. Still we are told it is going to be a 20 min wait. When I question the hostess about this, she tells me it might not be that long but they need to get some tables cleared off. There were other people around looking equally as irritated as we were. We enjoyed checking out the field, took some cool pictures and finally asked the manager 25 min later when we might be seated. His response was that he would seat us as soon as he could, but he didn't want to seat us and not have us get served. We experienced the only positive thing this place has going for it (location, picture opportunities) and got the hell out of there. Completely lame."}
{"text":"I love watching the game at Friday's Front Row. I always wait in line at the hostess station  to get seating right up on the railing. It's a good way to mix up your experience when watching a game at Chase Field. I usually start out the evening at Friday's before I go to my seats.

I much rather have a nice place to sit and eat instead of balancing crap on my lap in the seats. I usually grab a burger and a couple of Coronas. The burgers are just okay but the Coronas seem to hit the spot. I never have any issues with the service. And as other Yelpers have mentioned, you come to Friday's to enjoy the atmosphere, the food and drinks are secondary."}
{"text":"Just picked up our eight year old nephew from Sky Harbor and since he was hungry I figured this would be a cool place to take him. Since it was Sunday, we parked at the gyms parking lot. Other then that, the parking sucks. So we wanted to eat outside, well the roof was open in the stadium. Too hot! Then we thought sitting by the windows would be cool. Sun shining through the window. Too hot! But we still had a nice view of the field. I had the ribs and steak, never been that impressed with Fridays. And you know what? Still not! Steak was like mush, not much texture. Ribs were tender, however not that great. Nephew had a burger. Visit was nice, nephew loved it."}
{"text":"There's no better place to catch a DBacks game, except of course for actually inside the stadium.  I went for a Saturday 5:00 game, and was shocked at how few people there were in there.  If you sit at the end of the bar, you can definitely catch a view of the live game (if you're tall enough and don't mind squirming around to avoid the obstructions of the support beams and people that actually paid for their tables).  But regardless of whether you can see or not, you still get the roar of the crowd for every big play.

Granted - the prices are a bit higher and the selection is much more limited than your average TGIFridays.  But they do have drink specials and I had chicken fingers and fries that weren't terrible.  An interesting note - the TVs inside Friday's have a significant delay from the live game (7-10 seconds) which was weird when watching the TV broadcast, hearing the crowd react to a play, waiting for it to happen on TV, then getting the reaction from the restaurant.

Also, a note on pricing for the reserved tables.  Between my wife and I, we spent $30 each on food and drinks at the bar (a single app and entree between us and 2 or 3 drinks each).  Considering that the \"upper deck\" tables are $30/ticket with a $30 food/beverage credit, I think that makes the most sense for a last-minute decision to go catch the game.  The \"dugout\" booths, which are still inside the restaurant but closer to the stadium seats are $35/ticket with only $17.50 credit - to me that makes absolutely no sense.  I didn't get a chance to see the \"outside\" (of the restaurant) \"front row\" tables, but those are $55/ticket with a $27.50 credit.  Those might be cool to try out once, but not on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Great view and good service ! AJ our waiter was awesome very friendly. He also made us a root beer float for dessert not on the menu but very pleased he made it happen ! Will definitely be back next time I'm in town !"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Go in for happy hour with my dad at 4:45 and sit at the bar. No one else is there, not their fault but still weird. All the bottles of alcohol are still covered with paper cups, the beer taps are still wrapped and plugged, and the 10 staff are all hovered in the corner. No reason the place is empty!!!!!!! Got our nachos wrong but surprisingly the burger was amazing.

Only reason this gets 2 stars is it's connected to the baseball stadium.

P.s: prepare to pay for parking too! We risked the ticket and got lucky on the meters after it expired"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times to eat and also for other reasons. I like the food and have never had a bad meal or terrible service. Have always had a really good experience here.  The only thing I haven't done yet is eaten out on the patio overlooking into Chase Field. That is on the list still yet to do."}
{"text":"I don't know went people say this place is awesome. The food is average and the security at the door is rude. I have to admit the view is awesome, but you can't enjoy it after the doorman is rude and unfriendly."}
{"text":"Inside an enclosed MLB park, good view of the game from the front row tables and decent food covered buy half the cost of your ticket; For the concept alone this should be a five, no, six star review. Unfortunately the reality plays out a bit worse than it should. Lets start with service. What is the point of tipping the server after a meal?  To reward good service? To motivate the server to do well? Well, with a 20% built in gratuity what have we got? Exactly. 
The menu. Smaller by about 1\2 of the standard Fridays with none of the discounted combo meals. And the prices? Jacked up. OK so now lets do the math. $60 per ticket, $30 goes to food. Oh, it only goes toward food. I didn't know that. The gratuity and tax aren't covered. The tickets were $120 for myself and the wife. We ordered $60 worth of food and beverage and, surprise, still owed $18 at the end of the evening. Kind of pricey and not worth it. 
Extra innings. I'm a Mets fan but you gotta hand it to this young and talented DBacks team. D Wright is the most overrated player in the big leagues today. The Fridays Front Row seats should swivel, but don't, and since they are reserved, ticket holders  should not have to chase people from those seats when they arrive. Remember. Its Fridays. You know that before you purchase. If you go on fireworks night, move your fanny to an infield lower level seat. Otherwise the view is almost completely obscured. Remember. Its Arizona. The most convenient stadium exits will be  blocked by guards until, if ever,  they are told to open them."}
{"text":"Chilling with the spectacular sites of the ballpark is peaceful and relaxing.  (Especially if you can toss one back and not need to go back to work). If you like the TGIF menu (and I do) the only thing that would make this better is a bottomless stomach.  For me, here time stands still and I love it.  They also have TV if you are in the mood to do that too.  Its cool taking the elevator to the restaurant.  Everything makes this a unique place to try especially if you are a tourist.  You got to do it at least once!"}
{"text":"Friday's Front Row is a bar located in the Arizona Diamondbacks' Chase Field. You can walk straight into the bar during games for free, without a ticket, and find yourself a seat either at the bar itself or at one of the high tables. The tables closest to the field are, of course, reserved for ticket-holders only. But the further tables, if you can nab one, still have direct views of home plate. I love coming here with friends, especially when it's a mixed crowd of males/females, under my generalization that many of my female friends aren't big enough baseball fans to sit down and stare at the field in regular seats for 3 hours. If we come to Fridays instead, the focus isn't the field but simply the atmosphere and your company. You sit in a fun environment, order drinks and food from the menu, and just have a good time with friends. The game is viewable at every angle on tv's located throughout the bar. And every time something exciting happens, the crowd at the stadium gets loud and you can switch over to looking at the field to see what's happening. When a Dback hits a homerun, the bar lights up with excitement along with the rest of the stadium. It's a lot of fun. 

Four stars and not five because I think the management can do better in terms of service. 

With all that out of the way, let me tell you the story of what happened when I had lunch here for the very first time, when there wasn't a game going on.

My friend J and I walked into the lobby area of the stadium to take the elevator up to the restaurant. As we walked toward the elevator, a Mexican man (his nationality becomes relevant later, trust me) was discretely standing by it and he got into it with us. We rode up the elevator, got out at the restaurant, and told the host we were a party of two. However, as he walked us toward our table, unbeknownst to us the Mexican gentleman was walking right behind us. When we got to our booth, J had a seat, then I slid in behind him. And it was then that I saw the Mexican gentleman slide in behind ME. 

As J and I sat there soaking this incomprehensible scenario in for about 5 seconds, the host looked at me with an equally confused look on his face and asked, \"Uh, you only want two menus, right?\" I looked at the host. I looked at the Mexican, who was sitting right next to me in the booth looking straight ahead. I looked back at the host, and said, \"Um. He's not with us.\" The host looked back at me with a mix of--if you can imagine it--confusion and suspicion. I looked at the Mexican. J looked at me and the Mexican in total bewilderment. The Mexican finally turned to me and said something in Spanish. Conveniently, I speak 3 different languages. Unfortunately none of them happens to be the most prevalent second language in the state in which I've grown up. So I told him, \"No hablo espanol!\"

At that point the Mexican said something to the host (who was Hispanic American) in Spanish, and he slowly got out of the booth and the two walked away. Our waitress came to us about a minute later and not having seen what just transpired, asked us, \"Is it just the two of you today?\" We burst out laughing.

The host later told us that as he had walked the Mexican out of the restaurant, he told him that we had supposedly invited him to have lunch with us. Neither me, J, the waitress, nor the host could figure out the mysterious tactic this person was trying to apparently use to get a free lunch out of us. 

So that's the story. I think it's safe to assume that this will not happen to you if you decide to eat here. But it is pretty damn funny so I had to include it in the review."}
{"text":"It's not about the food or drinks here, it's strictly about the atmosphere. You can stop in for dinner and drinks and watch the Diamondbacks play while you dine! Located inside Chase Field, Friday's Front Row literally provides a front row seat to the action with floor to ceiling windows overlooking center field. During a ballgame, there are several options for interested patrons. You can buy a general admission ticket for Friday's Front Row and sit at the bar during the game. You can also access the restaurant with your regular Dbacks game ticket and either sit at the bar or at one of the available tables set aside for walk-ins, all with views of the field. If you want a window seat, you can call ahead and reserve a table for I believe around $50 a person but either all or some of that money can be used towards food and drinks, making it worth it in my book. 

The atmosphere is lively and festive. It's a perfect atmosphere to enjoy a game in and it's family friendly. However, adults can enjoy plenty of cocktails. Keep in mind, it is a TGI Friday's so expect Friday's style food and drinks but it's Friday's with a cool twist thanks to the backdrop of a Diamonback's game!"}
{"text":"This was barely a 3 based on pretty good food, ok prices and 1 of our 2 waiters being ok. The other waiter a taller guy with scruff was awful. No smile, no warmth, didn't bring steak sauce upon request. He ruined the whole visit. We won't be back. Oh and we had to wait 10 minutes for a table when we got there and there was a dozen seats open and the very table we say in was ready upon arrival."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. We had a get together with friends. There were eleven of us for the reservation. When we got there we were taken to our seat, which happened to be two booths that sat five people somewhat comfortably, better for four people I would think. It was terrible. We were separated from
Our friends which being at dinner was the whole point of being able to chat. We thought they would push tables together and we could all sit together. The next negative I want to bring up is the full menu. The menu was a \"event menu\" which was only a 1/4 of the full menu. Which everyone looked at the full menu online and had decided what they wanted prior to getting there. Everything came to a skid. We did find out we could probably order off the full menu the waitress said \"even thou she wasn't suppose to allow us to\". I ordered the California Club Sandwich, it was disgusting. The bread was dry and crumbled all over my shirt, the turkey slice was old, the chicken was grisly, their was a tiny slice of avocado a small smudge of mayonnaise and a soggy disgusting tomato. Needless to say, two bites and I was done. Sad to say I will never go back or suggest to anyone. Awful.  Our waitress was sweet though. 

One suggestion, this is at Chase Field, even when the team is out of town open it up. Open up the sliding doors and allow people to experience the beautiful field. That's what people are there for. It's certainly NOT the food."}
{"text":"Sunday V-Day 

Empty and boring. The service was oddly slow and odd in general. The waitress was overly nice and I swear she was Minnie Mouse @ Disney for a year or two. 

The food was good but not great. Everyone liked what they had but no one had a overwhelming time. 

The stadium was gross and ugly compared to the regular season vibrant green. It seemed a little sad. LOL

Although I did not have anyone sitting with me while trying to eat, I did have a man cleaning his washcloths in the sink. He was clean and friendly but I thought it was funny."}
{"text":"This is actually a TGI Friday restaurant, as stated on the sign.   It is part of the ball park, whatever name it is going by at the time.   There is a street entrance, and one must go up the elevator in order to gain entrance.   There had been quite a few locations of TGI Fridays in the past, and slowly they seemed to close.   I had a gift card, and decided to put it to good use.    I ordered take out the CHIPOTLE YUCATAN CHICKEN SALAD.   I notice the description states, \"Roasted pulled all-natural chicken breast served over mixed greens with kale tossed with avocado, mixed cheese, tomato, red onion, cilantro, tostadas and Avocado Vinaigrette. Drizzled with chipotle crema.\"   I didn't find any kale nor avocado.   I am glad it did not have any onion.   The salad greens were fresh and the chicken was lightly seasoned.   There were two dressings to choose from, one of which I used, and I have no idea what it was.  It was tasty and lent itself well to the mixed salad.   I think it was worth the trip.   If I was at the game, I think I would be inclined to order it."}
{"text":"Friday's on Friday for co-worker party.  The Diamondbacks were out of town and the restaurant was fairly dead which made for a nice, peaceful gathering. We had a room rented out ($50) and two waiters watching over our group of about thirty.  As for the night:

-Setting: For a baseball fan, you can not beat the view of the ball field. Throw in televisions of all sports and I am in heaven.

-Staff: Both waiters were very helpful and kept good care of us.  Drinks were never empty and food orders were taken as needed.  I was impressed by how they handled a fairly large group. 

-Food:  I tried the Jack Daniels Ribeye with a side of spinach and french fries.  For a steak under $20 I thought it was good and I enjoyed the sweet dipping sauce.  The spinach was tasty and the french fries hit the spot. 

Overall, I very nice night with good friends and good food."}
{"text":"Location location location!  Food sucks, staff sucks, drinks are mediocre but you are overlooking chase field. Game day it's pretty great"}
{"text":"TGIF always makes me think of the movie Office Space (the restaurant/bar was called Chachies in the movie, but was based on TGIF). It would never be my first choice in dining venues except when it comes to Chase Field. I love this location!

My friends were given fantastic seats behind the dugout. We decided to go to the game early to eat and walked into the TGIF entrance off 7th Street. Because the restaurant is connected to the stadium, security will look through your bags, and you will need to walk through a metal detector when you enter the restaurant. We were seated in a 2nd row booth that was elevated so we could easily see over the front row table that was against the railing. There are no windows. It's an open air concept giving you a clear, unobstructed view of the action on the field.

The place was very busy. Our waitress was harried and out of breath when she reached our booth, but she still did a fine job of serving our table, refilling our drinks, and finalizing our bill in a timely manner.

There was a television screen in view of our table that was showing close-up action of the field. We were able to enjoy the pre-game activities like the singing of the anthem from our table, and with the tv, we had a close up view of the singer.

The menu includes a variety of hamburgers and salads. My salad had a spicy, chipolte, avocado dressing and chunks of tender shredded chicken and avocado. This was probably the first time I have ever eaten healthy at a game. The salad was filling, and prevented me from indulging in the junk food served on the concourse or being peddled by vendors near our seats behind the dugout.

There was another security screening between the restaurant and the stadium, but we didn't have to walk outside because the two establishments are connected.

I really enjoyed eating here before the game, and I would definitely consider coming back and doing it again."}
{"text":"I do not have nearly the good story to tell about Friday's Front Row as Political Junkie Z did...  But we did see a great game there and ate some pretty decent food. 

Friday's Front row is an open-air Friday's above the left field bleachers, and the coolest part is, you don't need a game ticket. I mean, where else can you get this kind of seat without spending thousands of dollars on a fancy skybox? The food may not be fantastic but it sure beats a lukewarm rubbery stadium vendor hot dog any day."}
{"text":"I have visited this Fridays numerous times in the past with great experiences, so this review is specifically a reflection on today's visit alone. I wish there was a \"check out\" button so you could see how long I was there with my part of 4. I have rarely experienced service as slow as it was today, and there were few patrons during this time. We ordered simple lunches that consisted of sandwiches and salad, and another ordered the endless boneless wings. Although they are endless it took so long  to get the 2nd order it wasn't worth the price, and they come out the wrong flavor. The atmosphere of the ballpark helped, but thankfully we were not a strict timeline today. Hopefully we have better luck next time."}
{"text":"This Friday's does not, I repeat does not participate in Endless Apps, says it right on a placard before you go in. Someone said it did in one of the reviews and I was like...maybe the changed their mind because their review was 3 weeks ago...then got there and went, \"Yeah, no...no Endless Apps.\" Drives me nutz' when people give a review of the WRONG LOCATION. Pay attention people or get off Yelp.

Okay, that being said, the location is pretty neat. Get a seat by the windows on the southside of the restaurant when go and you get an overview of the field.  Pretty awesome looking out a big open area onto the field.  An experience I'm glad we had the chance to do.

Okay, now that being said-the food.  A lot left to be desired. My niece's had sandwiches and the bread I swear to you, I could not even crumble it in my hand. It  was extremely hard, it was as if they toasted stale bread to the infinite degree.  One of my nieces said it was like eating peanut butter Captain Crunch without any milk.

I had the bourbon chicken, meh! No flavor and the fact that they cook it on a wood plank you would think there be some type of flavor but yeah...no. The side of mac & cheese was pretty good though. Came on the side, in a little dish, I mean little. The sweet potato fries...limp and not crispy. 

I did mention the inedible bread to the waitress but yeah...\"Oh sorry,\" was all I got.  

Go for the view of the field but go anywhere else for the food.  Get an app, I like the 3 apps, pretzels with beer cheese (not bad, good taste), wings (bready but okay)and fried green beans with Wasabi (very yum).

Okay, the two stars because of waitress and the view of the field."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere always awesome when I come here. Krista was awesome. I had the BBQ chicken salad it was perfectly dressed."}
{"text":"This is an awesome venue. The view was awesome. The food was good and the service was excellent. I highly recommend going here anytime game or not for a beautiful dining experience. The wait staff was very nice and accommodating the food was good not great. The overall experience was spectacular. Come early and watch batting practice before the game. You can see a lot of homers and action. Way more balls flying than in the game. Fun to watch pro's taking BP"}
{"text":"We went to dinner on a Tuesday night and were pleasantly surprised that the restaurant was inside Chase Field.  The restaurant was clean and large.  This was the first time I seen a restaurant literally in the field.  We had burgers and the ingredients were good and fresh.  I would recommend for someone visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"Everytime we go we are extremely disappointed. We are always ignored, meaning we receive horrible service. On more than one occasion, we had to find a manager to get noticed! Our food tastes worse than frozen food. Growing up, Fridays was one of my favorite places to go, now it's on my least favorite places list."}
{"text":"We came here to eat before a baseball game. Despite the wait to even get in, 2 hours before the game, we were hopeful about a good experience. Unfortunately that was not to be the case. We ordered two roast beef dips and a veggie burger. The veggie burger was bland and dry. The roast beef dips were beyond disappointing. With dry roast beef, nearly raw \"grilled\" onions, almost non-existent horseradish and a jus that tasted like canned gravy, the only redeeming quality they possessed was that they filled part of our stomachs... The service was slow and most of the time we felt ignored. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"This tgiFridays is horrible. The food was horrible.  The appetizer jack Daniels chicken was like little bricks.  Fries were cold. thumbs down. Don't go here on a game day. There's no happy hour which is why we went. Thumbs down. There's no all you can appetizers cause of the game. Left paying over 70.00 for sodas and 2 meals. Thumbs Down."}
{"text":"So it's off season and we came to eat while downtown. There were minimal people in the restaurant yet the service was horrible. Extremely slow. Food came out and it was barely warm at best. Potato skins tasted like they were frozen. Cheese on them was definitely frozen, nasty cheese and same with the mozzarella sticks. $30 for appetizer plate and 4 non alcoholic drinks. (Also waitress swore there weren't kid's drinks so we paid $2.59 each!) Rip! HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND this place!! Do NOT eat here. We are sorry we didn't walk a few blocks to Copper Blues."}
{"text":"Went for St' Pattys. Good service. Waiter kinda loopy but still tried. I just like the atmosphere. Could have been cleaner. Over all good experience and cheap."}
{"text":"This is the average \"bar food\" type of place. I had the mini cheeseburger sliders off the appetizer menu. They were really good but they only give you two. Would have been perfect if they gave you three! This location however is prime because it over looks Chase Field! Great for a beer and a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"The draw here is to sit as close as possible to the field. The downside, they have a time limit at those tables.  Kind of a bummer if you're trying to watch the game.  What's nice is that you can walk in from the street, grab a beer and watch a few innings.  Great way to mix it up if you went to the game.  I love that you can walk down, get something to eat a normal table (versus eating at your seat) then walk back to your seat. and not miss a single pitch. Now I'm not a big fan of \"bar food\" and would normally have given this place a 3 star review but I will have to give it 4 because of the service.  I accidentally spilled a fresh beer and they brought me another one at no charge.  Thanks Friday's!!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a T.G.I. Fridays in years before I heard about this place on a recent trip to Phoenix.  It's located inside Chase Field, where the Arizona Diamondbacks play, but it has its own separate entry so you don't need a ticket to the game to get in here during a game. You can, however, see into the park from much of the restaurant. This was cool.

The place looks like any other Fridays, but a little nicer. It has a lot of baseball decor on the walls instead of the typical Fridays bric-a-brac and large TVs to watch games on. Plus, it has large windows that let you see into the park. You can't see the field from many of the seats, but looking in at the crown is fun. 

I was looking forward to stopping at a T.G.I. Fridays to try some of the food featured on that Food Network show, but during games they have a limited menu that excludes a lot of the good stuff including most if not all of the Food network recipes. That was kind of a bummer. 

On the plus side, the food we got was good. It was hot. The service was good and friendly. The beer was cold. We could see into Chase Field.

The server tells me that you can make reservations for the tables outside in the park and inside by the windows for a reasonable price, and half of that price is credited in food. It doesn't seem like a bad deal, and would be worth checking out for a game or an off night, especially for an avid baseball fan."}
{"text":"Must come see;this great bar; as it's on Chase field, It is Obvious Mike was mentored by Matt (Fridays manager)Very good service."}
{"text":"Great view, great happy hour specials, and awesome service. The only thing I didn't like about this place is that this Friday's is understaffed. During happy hour there was only 1 bartender and 1 server; in comparison, there was about 110-15 tables of guests. Recommendation: Get here early for happy hour."}
{"text":"This really is a great place to pregame. Especially because if you get stuck in a deep conversation or waiting for food, you wont miss the game! There really isnt a bad vantage point if youre in the bar area. They have a good selection of beer on tap and are super willing to put on whatever other game you may be interested in."}
{"text":"I live across the street and visit often. Could not ask for a better atmosphere with a view of the inside of Chase Field! The customer service has always been great. Often times it get dinner to go and the bartenders are friendly and chat it up while I wait. Just the traditional Fridays menu but the location makes it worth going. Definite place to check out when you are downtown. Doesn't have to be a game day."}
{"text":"Great service, great food (ribs were perfect) and drinks, best of all, great game. Thank you TGIF."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday evening and honestly I was a little underwhelmed. The view was great and I think that's the only thing really saving this place. Our waitress was sweet but service was still lacking. The woman at the table next to us had to stop a busboy just to get water for her and her daughter. The food was just okay, which I expected from Fridays. Overall, this is probably a good choice if you are seeing a baseball game but I wouldn't come here otherwise."}
{"text":"As kids, my husband and I each had fun trips to the Hard Rock Cafe that was incorporated into the Toronto MLB stadium.  The Toronto restaurant has since closed, but it left us with a lot of fun childhood memories.  

I saw that the Diamondback's had a similar establishment in the form of a TGI Friday's restaurant.  I haven't visited this chain in a few years, but I really wanted to check out the view of the baseball stadium.

We were seated in a very large booth overlooking the field.  The seats were really neat and it was a unique experience.

The food was typical TGIF grub, decent enough, but nothing overly special.

Our waitress was great and very efficient.

This would be a neat place to take kids to eat at."}
{"text":"Seated at the balcony in a reserved table during a game. Food and service were great, and the best part is that you get a credit of 50% of what you paid for the tickets towards food and drink.

Only downside is your way out in left field, no view of the jumbo TV, no feel of the energy of the crowd, so you feel a little left out of the ballpark experience. 

When the game is over, you cannot reenter the stadium, your forced to exit on Jefferson St. So if you parked at the garage that has the skybridge into the stadium, you cannot exit the stadium the same way you entered. 

So hit the shops before the end of the game, and think about parking closer to Fridays if your planning on staying after the game ends. 

Otherwise great time, good value if you go hungry."}
{"text":"Ordered steak and waiter didn't ask how wanted it done. It came way over cooked. The Cole slaw was slime and old. Had to send it back  I was done eating by the time my husband got his food. Not a good experience"}
{"text":"So, since the D-Backs were losing 10-0 in the 4th inning on this particular night, the hubby and I decided to spend the rest of the game sitting at the bar in Friday's.  It wasn't too busy so service was good.  We shared both some boneless buffalo wings and a chicken club sandwich.  The wings were decent but the sandwich really had no flavor...not a big surprise for a chain restaurant.  Overall, this location is what you'd expect from a typical bar and grill, but with a fantastic view of the field and stadium.  I'd love to return and get tickets for one of the tables overlooking the game."}
{"text":"This fridays is pretty coo n im truly bot a fan o gridays but this one is pretty awesome. U have a view of the field from the tables, eat drink n watch the game for. Hahahaaha. Id come bak for sure when there is a game. Food is good, price fair, service is good. Cleanliness is good to. Gotta come check it out it has a view of chase field like no other."}
{"text":"I believe this tgi Fridays is slightly worse quality food than the others as well as service.
I went when there wasn't a game going on but comicon was so a bit of a crowd was warranted. We waited about 20 minutes to get in and once we were sat down the waiter left. He didn't ask whether or not we wanted drinks until 10 minutes later and brought it to us another 10 minutes later. I started timing everything when we got the water and boy did it take a while. He left the water at the table then walked away again even though we were ready to order. Another 8 minutes went by before he came back to take the order. By this time the room seemed nearly empty to me as there did not seem to be that many customers on that side. We waited a whopping 33 minutes until our food finally arrived and the guy didn't check on us in between or refill water even though we tried to get their attention.
I was so hungry by the time the food came I devoured it almost instantaneously, but not fast enough to glaze over the fact that the chicken was too dry and the broccoli was overcooked. The meal was also around $17 not including tip so I did not find it worth it. It took more than an hour of waiting after being seated to get food and we were ignored most of the time. The waiter seemed apologetic afterwards but I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"Come for the atmosphere.  Try to enjoy the mediocre food.

The \"front row\" concept is what makes this Friday's worth checking out at least once.  Take TGIFriday's.  Put it in a major league baseball stadium.  You have now created the one Friday's that I am willing to eat at.  The food menu is a smaller selection of the typical family-friendly chain bar fare that you'd expect from any Friday's location, but there still is the large selection of adult beverages that is the reason your parents put up with taking you out to Friday's when you were a kid.  The reason anyone would come to this location in downtown Phoenix is simple.  It's in the ballpark.

You can eat at Friday's Front Row at anytime.  On game day, tickets are available to get a table on the patio and watch the D-backs play.  I believe a voucher for food is included in the price of the ticket.  Don't want to pay?  You can still eat and drink at the bar, where there is the benefit of paying normal prices for better food than what's served inside Chase Field, and you may still have some sort of view of the game."}
{"text":"We ate here tonight and we really tried to make the best of a major let down. The restaurant apparently had not communicated with the event planners at the ballpark. There was a large cheer event which resulted in many families looking to eat here. We waited for a table for over an hour and then sat down to find out the restaurant was out of hamburgers and steaks. It would be considerate if we were told this before we waited.  After waiting for a significant amount of time for our food & drink refills, we received our check and it had two tables worth of food on it. We ordered two adult meals and two kid meals. The ticket was for six items not on our table including appetizers and desserts. Our server seemed really overworked with more tables than normal because the restaurant didn't foresee this being a busy night. He said they had no idea about the event- how does this happen?!? The management really needs to make some improvements in communication with the ballpark in order to have the proper amount of staff and food and they should tell the waiting customers if they're out of half the menu."}
{"text":"TGI Fridays
Front Row Sports Grill
Chase Field
401 E. Jefferson Street
Phoenix, 85004

Is there a difference between TGI Fridays restaurants? You bet!!
Some are Franchises and some are corporate owned. Front Row Sports Grill is the only corporate owned TGI Fridays in the Phoenix area.

I arrived at the Front Row at 3:30 in the afternoon - half an hour earlier than I was supposed to. Having never been to Chase Field before I wasn't sure how easily I would be able to park or even it's exact location. That turned out to be a non sequitur.

As I walked into the building a small paper sign stuck to one of the doors directed me to use the elevator to go to Front Row. The sign said to go upstairs, but since there was no downstairs, it seemed a bit redundant.

The restaurant overlooks the entire stadium with a magnificent view. Had I been a true sports fan, I'm sure I would have probably drooled, but I was here to sample the fare and to meet companion. I was promptly seated at one of the tables. This was probably the only thing that I did find fault with. The tables not at the windows are very high as are the seats that accompany them. I was so high up that my feet couldn't touch the floor, which made me feel a bit uncomfortable. When I asked for a shorter table, the hostess told me that the waiter's/waitress's for those tables hadn't come in yet.

My drink arrived quickly, and unlike many other diet drinks I've had before, had enough syrup in it to actually taste good. The waiter didn't even trip up when I asked him for some lemons to squeeze into my drink. He promptly brought a dish of lemon slices, nicely arranged to the table.

While waiting for companion to arrive, I had time to study the menu. My first thoughts were that this was a place taking advantage of their location and charging for it. Fortunately, I was proven wrong again and again.

Companion arrived at 4:00, and we set about ordering appetizers. We shared an order of Buffalo wings which we asked for undressed but with assorted sauces to try with them. They were done to perfection, with stalks of celery and lots of dipping sauces. Companion had asked for the boneless wings, and the traditional were brought out by mistake. No problem for our server, who left the traditional wings at no charge and brought out the boneless ones. Again, while the boneless wings were of a different nature than the traditional ones, they were, non the less tasty and hot.

Since companion was a member of their stripes club (kind of like a frequent flier club), they brought us a complimentary order of house made potato chips. Thick cut, crunchy, non-oily, loaded with Parmesan cheese, they were terrific! I'd eat another order of those any day even though they aren't on my diet.

Next was main courses. The menu covers the gamut from simple fare to ribs and steaks. I ordered their Dragonfire chicken. A nicely cooked chicken breast with a kung pao glaze covered with pineapple pico de gallo and mandarin oranges on a bed of rice with fresh broccoli. The rice was the only weak part of this dish. It seemed over cooked and mushy, and I left some of it on my plate.

On the plus side, and a really big plus was the broccoli. Having eaten more than my share of the brassica family, most places tend to greatly over cook it, and usually serve it limp and dark green. My usual response is to leave it untouched on my plate. Yet here, in a relatively modest place, I found broccoli nirvana! Bright green, still crispy, and full of flavor.

Companion originally thought of ordering the ribs, but was so full from the appetizers that they ordered the Cheeseburger instead. Companion pronounced it to be perfectly cooked and nicely oozing with melted cheese. The burger was served on a brioche bun with all the proper accouterments. On the side were seasoned fries that were truly delicious.

Service was never rushed and our waiter came back to check on our needs often, but without being intrusive. Sanitation was good in the restaurant and the restroom, when I used it was nice and clean and fully supplied.

As followers of my writing are aware, I never let a restaurant know that I am reviewing them unlike some other reviewers. I made my first exception at the conclusion of this meal and complimented the kitchen manager. One has to wonder why, if a place like this can serve outstanding food, can't the rest of food service places follow suit? This was one of the most flavorful and excellent non-fancy meals that I have had the pleasure of enjoying in Phoenix.

I rate this 4 stars for excellent food, great service, and general cleanliness."}
{"text":"Went to this location last night with a close friend. Had a table overlooking Chase Field on a beautiful Arizona evening.

We both had steaks with the loaded mashed photos and steames broccoli. Even though the steaks were a little over cooked from the order, they were on point, and went great with the cold beers.

Finished the meal off with one last drink, the One-Two Rum Punch that our server Curtis made and it was fantastic."}
{"text":"Seriously this place is soooo great! Awesome views of the game and very reasonable prices. I will always eat here when going to dback games! Friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"Love the food! The staff is good too, only downside is that they don't have highchairs... or at least that's what we were told. Just for that reason, we won't be back unless it's a \"date night\" - having to chase a toddler who doesn't like to sit still (unless in a highchair) during dinner isn't an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"This is a great way to enjoy a game, it's regular Friday's food and 50% of the face value of each table is credited to the food and beverage total. The table is available about 30 minutes before the game."}
{"text":"There was no one in the restaurant, which should've been our first clue to run the other way. Service was exceptionally slow given there were 2 staff members for each one of us. 

I had a salad. And I got food poisoning. It was the only thing I had eaten that day, so no question where I got it. It was horrendous. This place needs to shut their doors, nasty."}
{"text":"While not my first trip to Chase field for a Diamondback game, it was my first time to Friday's Front Row.  

Initially I was concerned about the price, but after learning half the price of our tickets went back to us in food credit, well that seemed like a pretty good deal!  You just have to find a couple friends to go with you... because you do have to buy out an entire table, whether you use all the seats or not.  

My husband and I met our couple friends to check out the game versus the Cubs.  First thing the men noticed?  How much they appreciated the extra room.  The tables are like 1/2 pentagons, a table cut in half facing the field.  The men are both over 6 feet, and not having their knees jammed into the chair in front of them was worth it alone.  

Service was just ok.  They don't have to be awesome, they have a captive audience and they know your bill is going to be at least $130 and gratuity is added in on top of that.  

Food was just ok, your average Friday's fare... if you like it anywhere else you'll like it here.  It's a bit pricer at the field I think, and watch out--the drink prices are considerable (that's because they don't list them!).

Some other cons:  view, if you are really into the game these seats will frustrate you.  It's a good use of the backfield space that would have otherwise been cheap bleacher seats.  But you're looking at the game from a good distance, from the back side.  Also, Fridays is adjacent to the big screen, so you really can't even watch the game or replays on the big screen.  Also con: noise, you're right next to some huge speakers.  While the space would be good for kids, to be able to run around a little more than regular seats... for kids who are noise sensitive, BEWARE.  I was glad we decided to leave our little guy with the grandparents, I think those speakers would have made him pretty unhappy the whole game.

But, for experience alone it was worth it.  Extra room, ability to chat with friends while watching the game, having food and alcohol brought to you without waiting in line (oh, and bathrooms that are close too!).  I think we'll definitely be doing it again next season!"}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of TGI Fridays and generally try to avoid chains, but this one is not your average TGIF. We got DBacks season tickets this year and have stopped in at TGIFs before the park opens during happy hour to grab a beer. We normally sit at the bar and the service from the bartenders has been great! The one time we sat at one of the 1 hour limit tables, we were waited on by a recent transplant from the east coast. He was EXTREMELY friendly and gave us great service. Something I have not experienced at a TGIF recently. This is a great spot to watch batting practice but as far as watching the game not so much for me. The restaurant sits above the outfield in left and it's difficult to see the game unless you've spent the extra $$$ to sit on the balcony and I DO go to see the game. I hope to stop in here sometime soon (preferably celebrating a DBacks win) postgame to experience the restaurant and review again."}
{"text":"This is the best place to take out of town guests!  I love suggesting for them to grab their camera (or cell phone camera) and let's go to the ballpark.  It's a wild experience during a game, but I much much rather do it when there's no game on.  That way, we can sit (practically) anywhere we want and see the ball park.  My friends love it and love showing off their photos when they get home.  And as to the food, I have to, have to have the offerings that have their Jack Daniels Sauce.  OMG I love that stuff!  Wish I could have a tub of that sauce at home!  There's a few people out there that don't have any interest in baseball, so they would be there for the food.  But really, it's a great place to show how unique and amazing Phoenix is.   The service has always been good and so has the food.... did I mention the Jack Daniels Sauce?"}
{"text":"Good place to watch game if u have smaller kids..u have food service so u don't have your kids as tag a longs to wait in line for snacks and drinks and spill half of it before u can make it back down the stairs to ur seats.
Food fairly priced however I WILL NEVER PAY 3.50 at a restaurant for a small soda that does not have free refills again 15.00 for 4 sodas are u kidding! The $11.00 8 piece boneless wing order was nothing more that heavily breaded chicken nuggets with hot wing sauce splashed on them ( will NEVER order those again). Would not be complaining about our 60.00 bill ( 2 kids meals, 4 sodas, 4 scoops of ice cream 2 for each kid and 1 club sandwich and  boneless nuggets) if it was not for the no refill policy and I ordered a better appetizer."}
{"text":"If you're eating here because you've never been to Chase Stadium, walk in, see the stadium, take your picture and get the hell out.  I just saved you about two hours of frustration. You are welcome.  Or you can dine here, like my wife and I regrettably did.  We walked in, and requested to sit by the window... They told us it would be five minutes so we told them no problem at all.  We sat at the bar for 10 minutes, and though the bartender did wave at us, he never took our order.  Then the manager finally came and sat us at a regular table.  I told him we had been waiting for the table with a view, and it was almost as if I had asked him for his social security number.  He fumbled his words, and hesitantly spit out the words \"I have a waiting list\"... There were three empty tables and the restaurant was not full AND THEY DONT TAKE RESERVATIONS! So...WTF???  So we waited a bit longer and finally the nervous un assertive manager found us a table.  Cool...now we have been seated and decided to leave that little first impression behind us.  that's when we met our waitress.  Literally had to tell her every aspect of her job, step by step.  It was like we were training her on her first day of a waitress.  I literally would have gotten my food faster if I was waiting in line for a dodger dog on opening day....and only one hotdog stand was open."}
{"text":"It's hot. You're bored. And you're hungry. What to do? 

Why not catch a D-Backs game at Friday's Front Row Sports Grill?  It's a great way to see Chase Field and you'll get a bird's eye view of left field and third base. 

The food is okay- the menu has the standard TGI Friday's items, like wings, cheese sticks, fajitas, burgers etc. and the service is pretty good too. 

The restaurant has a full bar, and it sure beats leaving the game every hour (okay, half hour) to get a new beer or margarita. 

Friday's Front Row is family friendly and a great place to take the kids.  And there doesn't even have to be a game going on for you to come have lunch and check out Chase Field."}
{"text":"Worst service in downtown Phoenix.  It is like the wait staff does not even care. Go for the atmosphere and the food, deal with the staff best you can. Would imagine would be great during a ball game, I will still go back despite poor experiences. I wish they would step up their game."}
{"text":"Came on a quiet day, no Dback game but still a beautiful view. I love the Jack Daniels chicken sandwich and this is why we decided to come lol. Ordered a Tropical Berry Mojito shaker which was ok, I would've liked more lime/citrus flavor as it was really sweet and tasted more like the berry syrup. Server was decent, and checked with us a few times. Mainly here for the Jack Daniels sauce lol"}
{"text":"If you are a baseball fan and you are visiting Pheonix, this is a must.  Enjoy good food and watch baseball.  Great atmosphere, and most importantly good service."}
{"text":"The only good point about Friday's Front Row is the view.  My wife and I had come about 2 hours early for the Diamondbacks' game and decided to eat at Friday's Front Row rather than eat the stadium junk food for supper.

When we arrived, the waitress wanted to seat us in the booths away from the window, despite there being several open tables next to the window overlooking the field and the players having batting practice.  We had to push for getting a seat next to the window because those seats weren't in her zone.  So for us sitting there, she had to surrender us to another waitress.  So goes the competitive world of being a waitress.  We just wanted the better seat.

Now in our better seat next to the window and watching the Reds' players having batting practice, we had 20 minutes to look at the menus because the waitress was quite slow in returning to take our order.  This despite a sign on the table saying that patrons were limited to 1 hour at this table.

We finally ordered.  I got the Jack Daniels Burger while my wife got a salad.  My burger wasn't that great.  Not that big of a meat patty and it was lukewarm.  It probably had been sitting for a few minutes before the waitress ever brought it out.

Anyway.  Eat here for the atmosphere, not for the food."}
{"text":"I tried this place to show some friends the stadium in the offseason and we had a bogo coupon. It was deffinatley a Fridays. Nothing great, nothing awful just decent chain food. The atmosphere cool, and if you like baseball check it out. The best deal is happy hour 4-7 which has $4 appetizers and $2 beers. It worth a visit but don't expect a 5 star dinner."}
{"text":"Great food. great view of the ball park. cant wait to go back there"}
{"text":"Best place for macaroni bites! Yummy goodness in a bite wit bacon on top and melted cheese.

Add to your apps! Dumplings were a surprise on the menu because you think, what Chinese? They are amazing though! 

If your in for just apps and drinks or a sit down dinner the views are awesome and the atmosphere is lovely! Never had to wait for an open table. Which is surprising because the place seems smaller than a regular restaurant."}
{"text":"Going in - you know your going to get typical TGIF food.  But the view is great!  If you're a sports junky you need to eat here once.  We took my grandfather, a sports nut, for lunch (hopped off the light rail) and he loved it.  As we ate lunch on the \"patio\" we watched as the landscapers groomed the field.  The top was open, the sun was shining, a breeze was blowing...ahhh..  The service was perfect.  Our server was funny - took time to chat and made sure we had what we needed as soon (or before) we needed it."}
{"text":"One of the few American Food chains in downtown Phoenix.  While I don't like chain restaurants, it is always nice to have a place where you can count on a certain dish no matter where in the country you go.  

This Friday's is quite different than most.  Gone are the red & white striped awnings and, in their place, are rows of Dbacks and other baseball memorabilia lining the walls.   If you are a baseball fan, you will love this place simply because of the decor.  If that wasn't enough, you get to enjoy the signs and sounds of a major league baseball game (81 days of the year) and the field itself for every other day.  All in all, a pretty nice setup.

This Friday's does tend to be priced a bit higher than others in the area.  The service is also much slower.  Also, if you are watching the Dbacks play, you may lose your appetite."}
{"text":"Been about a year and a half since I updated this review. Stopped in here on a Saturday night and me and my goofball both got the endless apps. They said as long as we only got one app at a time it would only be $12 even though we were both eating. Our apps were replaced in reasonable time and as always the servers were great... they even put the Coyote's game on the TV for us to watch as it was not on one where we were seated. It was a nice dinner, and for desert since it was pi day I got a piece of peanut butter chocolate pie. It is definitely a small piece for the price (and I am spoiled with My Mother's which one slice about the same price is like 1/4 a pie) but was good. Will I be back? Of course... just not for game days since they crank up thier prices even more and remove a good portion of the menu."}
{"text":"We decided to take our son here for dinner on his last night in town because the boy loves baseball. We were a little bummed that everything inside the stadium was dark so we could not really see the field. We were able to go out into the stadium itself on the restaurant patio which in itself was pretty cool.

The food here was actually quite good. I had the Jack Daniels flat iron steak and it was awesome. My hubby had the JD Burger not complaints either. To drink I had the BFM (Best Friday's Margarita) which was $10..total waste. Not only did it have a strange taste, but very weak. Next time I will just stick with an ice cold beer.

Overall we had a nice time and while the drinks were a little spendy I think the food prices were about average."}
{"text":"I came here with a group and I must say that the service was friendly and efficient considering the size of the group. The location, inside chase field, is very nice and you can see the park from the tables. The lunch specials were decently priced, including a salad or bruschetta.... but the food was nothing special. I had the bruschetta, French onion soup, and fries... everything was bit salty, but not terrible. Would I come here again? Probably not, but you could do worse."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try out TGI Fridays for a beer during the baseball game to get a bigger bang for our buck. For what we would pay for a small hot dog and 20 oz beer, we could get a great meal, larger beers, and great service, right?! Wrong. 

The restaurant was not very crowded for a game night, yet we were denied a table overlooking the stadium. Twice. The manager asked us to visit the hostess stand to get a table, but they informed us there was a wait. NO ONE WAS IN LINE FOR THE RESTAURANT! 

I had to get our own menus from the bar, after playing \"let's avoid making eye contact, and maybe she will go away.\" After we ordered, three sets of people were sat in the tables we were waiting for, and their meals came out before our order! 

Our waiter ended up offering us a free beer for the late arrival of our food, and ended up comping our entire check, but that will be my last visit \"Front Row.\" 

I'd rather pay $10 for a beer and $8 for a processed hot dog than to get snobbed by anyone in the service industry. All I wanted was a good time after a work day from hell, and to enjoy a Diamondbacks game ..."}
{"text":"Stood there for 15 min waiting to order a beer. Bartender helped those that came after me several times. 

We were wearing opposing team jerseys, but still not an excuse."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this Friday's while walking around Phoenix on a Sunday afternoon.  I wanted to just go up and have a drink and then take some pictures of the empty baseball field.  Phoenix was completely empty!

When I got closer to Chase Field there were some more people and I realized that there was a game going on!  I didn't think I would be able to get into Friday's because of the game; however, it wasn't very busy!  I sat at the bar since I was by myself.  But once I was there awhile, I noticed there were still tables open looking out into the ballpark.  So basically you get to watch the game for free as long as you are ordering stuff.  I thought that was pretty cool.

As for the food/drink...
I ordered a daiquiri when I sat down.  It was pretty bad.  Almost too slushy.  I looked through the menu and asked if they had any smaller portions or lunch portion.  I was told that since it was a game day they have a different menu and everything is larger.  So I didn't order any food.

The service was good.  The waiter was nice and another waitress named Kimmy even came up and talked to me for a little while.  I'd definitely come here again just for the view."}
{"text":"The Good:
1. Great location!
2. Awesome atmosphere during events.
3. Beer is cheaper here than in the concourse. 
4. Great place to take out of town friends and family to.

The Bad:
1. Typical TGI Fridays food.
2. Its a bit pricey compared to a regular Fridays.
3. Limited menu on event days."}
{"text":"This is a great concept with a great view of the field.  We didn't sit here for the game, but instead went in to watch batting practice.  On top of that we just had beers.  Apparently, they sell tickets for the games at the restaurant and clear out the seats a little before game time."}
{"text":"Epic Failure!

Went for lunch with a coworker. Sat for nearly 10 minutes without a waiter/waitress coming to our table. We watched people who arrived after us get their drink orders taken and delivered during that same time period. 

The only time when we thought our waiter discovered us is when we got up to leave for a different restaurant. Someone was chasing after us as we walked to the elevator.

The hostess was equally clueless. She apparently didn't recognize us as the people she brought to a table only moments ago and asked if we enjoyed our lunch.

The place was only a third full at most. No reason for the extremely poor service.

Can't wait until Sliders opens for the season!

This TGI Fridays is an epic failure!"}
{"text":"We should have turned around when we saw the sign \"now hiring all positions.\" We didn't. Took five mins for hostess(es) to stop their conversation to seat us. The server took 10 minutes to come see us (there were four tables and three servers) she obviously didn't want to be there and it showed. My mom ordered medium well burger and it came back barely cooked. After 40 minute wait to get our food she just ate it. Don't bother."}
{"text":"It's nice having a Friday's fairly close to my house in downtown.  Unfortunately, this one does not provide me with the same quality of service and value for food as the other ones do.  I appreciate the change of decor here, as this Friday's is definitely geared around the Dbacks and not the usual kitschy crap.  The food here is just as good/average as at the other locations, but I feel a little ripped off coming here.  It's always more expensive, but I guess I can understand given the neat view.  I've never been on a gameday, but I can't imagine how awful that could be.  Service is terrible here, even when nothing is going on.  Factor in the chaotics that a game most certainly brings and you set yourself up for disaster.  This is not going to be a quick or cheap meal.  If you are looking for an interesting place to kind of hang out in downtown when there isn't a game going on, Friday's Front Row is a pretty good choice, plus it's right off a lightrail stop."}
{"text":"Decent place, one of the servers sent our food to the wrong table but other than that the service was good. The view of the field is amazing. I didn't go during a game so I can only imagine how alive this place can get. I'd come here again. :)"}
{"text":"We went there with a large group of people after a volleyball tournament that was at the convention center across the street. It was convenient and next to the parking garage so you don't have to leave and find parking again. 

The food was like typical diner food. It wasn't anything special but I'm not a huge Friday's fan. In the past few years I've been twice and both times were at this same location. Also, they had a fixed menu for special event seating which I assumed was because we had a large group but not really sure. There was different options but it wasn't their full menu. 

The service was slow but the waiter was nice. We had a group of 15. Each group got separate checks which is good but we got them all at different times and they weren't all correct. The food didn't always come out correct either. 

I would give it two stars but the location and the view of the Diamondbacks stadium was awesome. We sat facing the ballpark and could imagine how cool it was be to sit there during a game. It also has outside access so you can get closer to the field and look around the stadium and take pictures. That is the reason I come here and probably why I'll come back."}
