{"text":"As a sushi explorer, I like seeing and tasting new things on the menu. Maison Du Japon clearly delivered a complete new experience and opened my eyes to a whole new level of what AYCE truly means. Fast Service, friendly environment, and great food were among a few qualities that stood out.  Fast Service: Mind you, we got there earlier than normal (dinner), and we were sat immediately. Not only the sitting part and no lines ups were a bonus, the food delivery was superb also.   Friendly Environment: Although, there was a construction when we went, that didn't retract us from going in and having a good time. We even saw a party being held, which was kind of unexpected, but cool.  Great Food: The Chef's specials were an eye-opener. Apollo, Poseidon, and UFO (yes, tried them all), all have that distinctive taste. Pleasantly surprised how the UFO melted in my mouth (see my uploaded photo). It was just a normal diced salmon on top of a yam tempura, but the sauce made it unique... just refreshing.  Of course, there's one thing that I did not like (food-wise). If you ask...I would not recommend the Pork Cutlets. It was dry and difficult to bite -- kind of rubbery.  To conclude, I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Was there on a Sunday at about 2:30 and was kind of rushed through out lunch as they had to get ready for dinner. They also forgot our miso soup but other than that the sushi was really good. Other than that, the service was good, our food came at a resonable time and the waitress was attentive to our table. My favourite role is spicy salmon and at this restaurant the portion was slightly bigger than most other AYCE sushi restaurants I've been to. I'd go back again."}
{"text":"I went there several times and it is still one of my favorite restaurant All u can eat restaurant I like the food there The price is reasonable  However, the waiters are too busy They should hire more waiters I would give them a 5 star for everything except the service This service is not too bad, they juz need more workers as I said"}
{"text":"Overall a good experience. Not the best sushi ever, but to their credit it was a very busy lunch rush at the time. Food came out relatively fast and moderately tasty. I love sushi but I am no sushi connoisseur, so the $12 price for all you can eat was a plus too.  The private room (they have 4 or 5 of them) was perfect for containing the kids. Would not have worked out with a 3 and a 5 year old in the crowded restaurant otherwise. I gave it one extra star for that.  Will be back and would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Great place for all you can eat sushi.  The fish quality is above average (relative to other places in markham). The customer service is always great and they dont take too long to get food to your table."}
{"text":"I give it n overall 3 stars.. because the staff seems to really hates their jobs. When it was time to order another round our server was nowhere to be found. Quality of food is average. Nothing special. Probably wont return..There are hundreds of ayce around the city."}
{"text":"If your thinking of doing a private event at this restaurant I highly recommend you don't. My sister chose this place to do her son's Baptism we had 111 guest and we were all starving. They were not prepared to serve that many people we had to grab our own glasses and water,our orders didn't come."}
{"text":"I like this Restaurant, i visited this place during lunch time for the last year and i always had great time... It might be not the greatest place to eat, but definitely is enough comfy to spend the time with somebody and enjoy some Japanese food.  I recommend to try the Green onion beef roll, Yakitori & Black pepper beef.. Those are my favourite..!!!  Great food for the lunch price $14 bucks... Did i mention drink included it..???   Anyway, i recommend you should try it."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING! We just had dinner there today even though the sashimi didn't look fresh - surf clam was an orange colour (vs the usual dark red), salmon sashimi looked like it had been sitting in room temp for a while and butter fish sashimi was still thawing and very cold. Still we ate the food and...voila! 3 hours later I am puking my guts out while my husband is having crazy diarrhea and fever. I do not recommend this place at all and think this is one of the worst AYCE sushi out there - the food sucks and service is really bad. We had to order some things twice since the waiters would skip some of the order and we had to chase after them for little things like spoons or napkins. In the end we just wrote on the menu/place mats what we wanted to order so that there were no excuse. For the love of GOD, DO NOT GO THERE!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good,  and compared to other local all-you-can-eat sushi restaurants, the price is fantastic.  Lunch is only $11.99.    I haven't been there for dinner, so I can't comment on the price or the quality of the food at night.  My only minor issue is with the seating.  The tables are a little too close together, and the chairs are a tad uncomfortable (maybe the owners don't want the customers lingering, and eating up their profits)!  It is best to come early if you're hungry and want to be seated quickly.  They do get busy."}
{"text":"Exceptional customer service and food is always good. Ken is thee best!!! Good price and quality"}
{"text":"Food was okay, there are better AYCE sushi places. Sushi rolls were 75-80% rice there were very little ingredients wrapped inside the sushi roll. The sushi rolls were also very loose, the roll/ rice were falling apart.  The octopus on the octopus sushi ( avalible only on weekends) was very very thin.  The food came very quickly, however lots of orders were missed and a few items that came we did not order.  GOODS: food came very quickly NEEDS IMPROVEMENT: quality of food"}
{"text":"Had a pretty solid experience yesterday for ayce lunch, would give this place a 3.5 if I could. The price was really reasonable ($15), and actually a bit cheaper than other nearby ayce sushi places, for about the same level of quality.   Nothing too special, but the place was clean, service was fast, and the ingredients seemed fresh. I wasn't a big fan of some of the beef dishes or chicken teriyaki, but the rolls were good - my favorites were the black dragon roll and crispy crab roll.   The only let down is that they don't serve sashimi during lunch, but I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Sub-par sushi serving the workers in the area for lunch. I see why it's busy as there's not much around this area.   Straight to the point, this place gave me food poisoning. I don't know what it was, but my party got the same. I'm thinking it was the mackerel, but everything was made so mediocre I can't really pinpoint it. Nothing was fresh which should have been my first clue to get the heck out of there!   Service was okay for a busy lunch period. It's the only reason I'm giving the a star (and because yelp won't let me score 0 stars)"}
{"text":"Im going to keep this one short. This restaurant can be summed up in one word. Meh.   (Walk across the street to Fushimi instead, don't J-walk, cross at the light - thank me later - See my review of Fushimi)"}
{"text":"I used to like this place, after last night, I don't think I'll be going back. For one, they don't serve the spider roll anymore, why?! They used to have it. The quality seems to have been downgraded as well. While certain items were good, like the short ribs and teriyaki salmon, however the main attractions - the sushi rolls, were just ok. There are better places for AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"There are much better ayce sushi places in the west side of town vs this place. Still a decent place but not the best by any means"}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi, been going there a lot lately.  Food comes fast and the sushi is not packed with rich like some restaurants do to get u as full as possible."}
{"text":"Japanese restaurant mainly buffet. Inexpensive for lunch. Good selection average quality. Good for families and larger groups. Only one type if buffet can be picked for a group."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to this place. This use to be my go to place for AYCE. They definitely have been going downhill the last couple of months.  Not sure if the owners are greedy or if the business is struggling to survive. Price has increased, quality of food has decreased.   They pack all the sushi with rice to make you full. They stopped offering free drinks. Now you have to pay extra. (And they are not refillable) They took all the expensive items out of AYCE such as the sweet shrimp and the spider rolls.   They place use to be packed with customers. With all these changes I can tell I'm not the only one that decided to stop going. Definitely will not be going back. Good luck with staying in business."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times I had food poisoning after. The first time, I gave it the benefit of the doubt because I was the only one out of the group that got sick. But after the second time, I knew I wasn't going back, and it never happened to me after any other AYCE sushi.  The first time I went, the service was great, but not so much the second time."}
{"text":"$19 for AYCE sushi in that area is already cheap. U get what you pay for. For $19 dinner, I will gladly keep returning there.  Also, it's rare to find a AYCE that includes drinks in the buffet. A coke is my fav way to end a binge salmon eating session!"}
{"text":"I come here a few times.  This time when I come into the restaurant and waiting for seat, I can smell very strong fishy smell as a few big fresh salmon are being sliced and cut into pieces at the sushi counter.  I don't know whether the salmon has actually gone through the process of freezing for more than 72 hours at 4 degrees Fahrenheit to make them suitable for sushi or sashimi serving by the strong fish smell.  By the time when I finish the meal, the whole day I can still have the smell come out of my stomach, not to mention that I at last cannot take it and vomit them out.  The weekend lunch is $13.99, a very good deal.  Special recommendation is Grilled Mackerel, Grilled Pike Mackerel, Black Pepper Beef. The hand roll is very loose and the rice for sushi can easily break apart when picked up by chopstick.  It definitely does not pass.  If you are a salmon lover, you should order the Salmon Wasabi Cake rather than the salmon sushi as the piece of salmon is almost double in size.  The restaurant somehow serves you less for the sushi and sashimi but to give you more of Yam Tempura, Eggplant Tempura and Gyoza.  Don't know whether it is a strategy to make you full much faster!"}
{"text":"One of my biggest restaurant regrets for 2015. Came here for a weekend lunch with the family. 1) too salty 2) NO tuna at all... Not even white tuna 3) the audacity to charge $16.99 per person?   Worst place ever."}
{"text":"For an AYCE sushi joint, the quality of the sushi and freshness is super. The menu selection was wide, service was good and quick. Order whatever you want and it'll be delivered to you at your table.  At $22 on Fri Sat and Sun, it might be a little pricy but worth it if you are in the mood for a sushi and japanese binge. Unlike other AYCE places, the sushi are not loaded with rice and look well-made.  The only gripes I have are that the grilled eggplant I ordered was actually fried, the beef teriyaki was extra buttery, and the menu is just a sheet of paper on the table. No pen or pencil to mark down exactly what you want on some order sheet.  Regardless, this is seems like a good all you can eat sushi place and you should definitely judge for yourself."}
{"text":"I really like this place and I think it's underrated on Yelp. Came here with Mom for mother's day without a reservation (didn't think I'd need one) and it was very busy, but still only ended up waiting about 10 minutes for a table.  They were especially busy that evening and there were several occasions where our orders got dropped or mixed up, but the waiter was super gracious about checking our orders, and also letting us turn down an item which had arrived late, after we were already very full. His great attitude definitely made up for the small logistical mishaps, and made this a great experience.  He also recommended that we try the torched sushi when they ran out of the eel sushi that we ordered, and it was absolutely fantastic! Super thin slices of salmon, gently cooked with a torch. Phenomenal.  I am always happy to come to this place, and on days when it's not too busy, the food comes quickly and they usually don't forget any orders. Service is usually phenomenal as well. Definitely will be here regularly."}
{"text":"It was quite a decent experience at Maison du Japon. Came here for dinner two years ago, actually. Met with friends and had a good time. The menu they used was a single use fill-out sheet. I felt that we just killed a tree after leaving the restaurant, because it's was AYCE and we had to ask for the paper almost every time we wanted to order something new. They didn't have some of the fish I was hoping to have. I clearly remembered that I could not even find tuna in the menu and I was quite disappointed because I love tuna. But otherwise definitely a good meal.  If I would give a rating for the overall experience, I'd say 7.3 out of 10. The way they do things is quite confusing. I don't understand why they do the fill-out sheets. Such a waste of paper. If it wasn't for that and the lack of tuna, I wouldn't be disappointed in this place at all.  There was an AYCE across the road that was also quite a decent experience. I went there two years ago. But I just discovered that the location is closed now. That's too bad."}
{"text":"This use to be my spot but stopped coming cause I found better ayce. Recently returned out of necessity for a b day celebration but was happily surprised to find they updated their menu and added new items as well as more dessert selection! Make sure you come for din on a Saturday night when their new items are available to avoid disappointment. So now I will probably return and try out all the other new items I couldn't fit into my stomach!"}
{"text":"been aiming to eat here for a while but never got the chance because whenever I crave for AYCE, I always end up at 168 or spoon and fork.  for some reason, the stars aligned on a weekday and I was finally able to sample the AYCE lunch. Honestly, wasn't disappointed but wasn't impressed either. It's really as average as can be. I find it hard to type any more stuff about this place. The price is good but everything else was just ok.   Still sticking to my favorites."}
{"text":"The other day I ordered a simple sushi lunch take out. The assorted sushi was mediocre, California rolls were not bad, the salad was okay, nothing to write home about. Same with the miso soup. It's okay if you're craving sushi lunch and have no where to go, but I think if you have time to travel a bit you could go somewhere better.   The weird part was, the sushi combo included one container of plain white rice. I really have no clue why that was included! The sushi and maki rolls already have rice in them. It would make sense if I ordered chicken katsu or beef teriyaki, but for the sushi combo it's not necessary. In fact, I would have appreciated an alternative, perhaps a few gyoza dumplings or something would have been much better.   It just goes to show they don't really have it all \"together\", despite the age of the establishment."}
{"text":"It was pretty good.  Food kept coming when asked.  Sashimi was fresh.  A lot of variety.  Our waitress was really friendly.  $20 on a weeknight.. It's what I expected...can't ask for anything more.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Terrible sushi but I like the tater tots lol.  I used to come here years ago for  cheap 12$ ayce sushi back in high school. I recently went for dinner and the sushi was horrible the sushi rice taste like it was mixed with Chinese medicine same exact taste of when you walk into a Chinese herbal store and the smell hits you in the face. The other food items were just okay. I wouldn't recommend this place to fix any sushi craving"}
{"text":"Can't go too wrong with the price for either lunch or dinner. Under $20 for All You Can Eat is very reasonable. However, the selection is very limited - there's no tuna at lunch, and when you do bite into the fish sometimes you can feel the frost. This is NOT fresh. That said, the white fish is okay and the sushi pizza is a guilty pleasure."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try as we always pass by on Woodbine. Overall an alright AYCE place. Nothing special, but somewhat fairly priced as it's $25 per adult. Everything served was below average or so-so. Lots of variety if that's what you're looking for. I would probably spend the extra ~$5 to go eat at KAKA instead."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed with their AYCE as compared to other places. Reasons below:  - the food are extremely salty  - a few of the cooked items like the chicken curry was raw - they have very little selection for the price you're paying - Noodles and ramen are too big portions. Can't try anything else after eating them - Salads and seaweed; they halve your portions and put them on one plate  Highly not recommend this place. You can definitely get better AYCE experience elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is always clean and fast, but the food just doesn't compare to other all-you-can-eat sushi restaurants in the area. They can handle large groups easily and if you want something fast and relatively cheap it's a good choice, but the quality isn't always there. When I first used to go there I thought it was great, but I've since been spoiled by a lot of good sushi (lots of it AYCE) and now that I've been back I'm a little let down by the freshness and taste. Make sure your first order is stacked because it'll take a while to get the second.  Good starter sushi restaurant, but I try to push for somewhere with better sushi now when my friends are looking for AYCE."}
{"text":"You want to eat like a king on a pauper's budget, check this place out. The food is good and plenty. The selection is unbelievable for what you pay. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Overrated hyped up ayce sushi place. Nothing authentic. Came with the bf and experience was overall bad in general won't go back.   Note: food that isn't finished is overcharged."}
{"text":"Cams here once before for my birthday about 6 months ago, had all you can eat that time, it was average quality and service wasn't too bad considering we were tucked away way at the back.  This time since I was working a night shift at a rink close by I got take out bento box. Quality is just okay I would give the quality a 3/5 star but the price was right!! With tax my dinner bento box came out to under 13$ that's a steal considering my other nearby options that were not near this healthy or get this kind of selection on one meal! That and I love Japanese food!   Place was busy lots of ppl eating there must mean they are doing some thing right and mind you it's only a Tuesday! I would come again if I was hungry and in search of cheap quick Japanese food ( food was ready in 10min from the time I called)   Lots of parking! Options other then ayce and price point isn't bad even at dinner time!"}
{"text":"I am not an expert on sushi. But I have been here a few times mostly for work functions. So of course the service as I remember was pretty adequate. Nothing special. The food was to my liking."}
{"text":"I went to this all you can eat Sushi place recently after visiting a friend who lived in the area and went here under his recommendation. He CLAIMED that the place was fantastic. In reality, it was absolutely standard. I'd even hazard to say it was on the lower end of standard for AYCE Sushi places in Toronto.  I got the chance to try a wide selection of items on their menu and only one item stood out as very good; their Chicken Skewers had some spice on them that was actually very good.   Having been to well over a dozen AYCE Sushi places over the last few years, I still stand by my top choice which you can find within my reviews. THAT place, much closer to downtown is light years better than Maison Du Japon.   All that being said, if you're way uptown and looking for AYCE options, you'll do fine at this place but don't go if you are really looking for a stand-out experience."}
{"text":"went here for father's day 2014.  I been here before but haven't come back.  So after coming here again for the third time I do not think it is anything special.  I also do not know why they charge so much.    There is a pretty good selection of items not usually seen (yogurt, ice cream, whip, dim sum items) however unfortunately no red dragon!"}
{"text":"Do you want to be disrespected? If so, feel free to eat here.  Will never eat at this restaurant again.  The food is alright. The rolls are small and relative to typical all-you-can-eat (ayce) sushi restaurants, the proportion of rice to fish is acceptable. The desserts were standard, but the biscuit mousse was particularly good.  Like several others have said, they don't give you what you order. They arbitrarily divide your orders by half. This is common among ayce sushi restaurants, so this was not surprising. What was surprising was the horrible service.  At one point, one of the people at our table misremembered how many soups they had ordered and brought this to the server's attention. (He was probably late 30s, early 40s). He went into the kitchen to fetch our order sheet and pointed out that we had in fact ordered that number of soups. That was fine; we recognized that we had made a mistake and the server had taken the right steps in resolving our issue by double-checking the original order. However, how he reacted afterwards was atrocious and unacceptable.   He slammed the order sheet on the counter, exhaled loudly almost like a yell, and left in a huff. Our table was stunned to silence.   That was how he reacted to three \"extra\" soups. Not a plate of sushi or anything actually expensive. And this was within the first five minutes of us eating there, so it's not like we had been difficult customers.  Had this not happened, the restaurant would have been an acceptable ayce sushi restaurant - not bad, not exceptional, nothing special, but acceptably average.  However, having experienced this, there is literally nothing anyone could do to make anyone in my 10-person party want to eat there again.   On top of that server's outburst, another server (middle-aged, female) was also very rude. When bringing food to our table, she would shove past or in-between us to reach the table without warning. If you were leaning over your plate to eat something, she would actually reach under your arm and place the dish under your chest or face, so that you would be mere inches from the food, mid-bite, with someone invading your personal space. Even after we let her know that this wasn't okay with us, she continued to do this for the rest of the evening.  This is not even an off-day of service; this is simply a poor to non-existent standard of service. It was infuriating and I would not risk coming here again."}
{"text":"First time in there, The service nice and fast. The dishes are clean and practical but the only thing me and my wife liked from their menu was their shrimp tempura.  The sushi is made with too much rice and dry.  It bothered us after we ordered the second roll because is too cold."}
{"text":"Substandard AYCE sushi experience. While the lunch menu has a decent variety of maki rolls, teriyaki, hand rolls, and the usual selection of Japanese cuisine, it is very limited and begins to seem like you are eating the same few dishes and flavours over and over. The wait staff is quite friendly, and you are typically given the correct amount of food you ordered (contrary to many AYCE sushi restaurants underserving the quantity you initially ordered). The location is quite spacious and is rarely overly busy. Not a spectacular and unique sushi bar, but definitely decent enough value and quality if you're simply looking to just have large quantities of sushi."}
{"text":"Arrived here for a Friday afternoon lunch. It was busy when we got in but we were seated relatively quickly but after that, the service got shakey.  We didn't get tea, pencil to order, menu sheet, or soy sauce once we were seated. Sadly we didn't realize this all at once so we had to 'order' these items individually as we realized that it was missing from our table.   The food was standard. Nothing particularly inventive and that standard selection was just okay.   I'm pretty sure some things were missed but we were full enough to not really care.   Random observation: their endame seems to have a bit more salt than other places I've been to"}
{"text":"Wait staff could have cared less about us. It took forever to get our food orders taken. We also weren't provided beverages. We had to request a drink order separately, and even then they didn't bring enough glasses for the table.   Also, note that the drinks aren't \"rerfillable\""}
{"text":"Work outing, and i'm kind of glad that we went with an all male group. $13.99 AYCE weekday lunch menu. I must admit that i am not the biggest sushi fan, however they did have lots of choices.   I kind of felt like a black guy trying to waive a taxicab in new york city when it came to the service,  the servers would try to look straight forward and ignore you. However , they are extremely busy. So be prepared to wave your hands in the air like your dancing to the Village people's- YMCA.    Overall, i was more then satisfied with my visit and the fact that i haven't even completed 40% of the items they have listed - I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great place for a family outing for all you can eat sushi. They have a variety of other dishes to compliment their sushi. Food is good."}
{"text":"Came on a Tuesday. Not too many people but service was slow. Definitely not impressed. Food ordered wasn't too bad. Average at best compared to other ayce. Our 2nd order got lost and we had to order again after 30 minutes of waiting. Complete waste of time. Would not go back here again."}
{"text":"average to subpar. More on the subpar side. I've been here years ago and it was quite decent back then. Now it's not even AYCE standards for me.  We came on a weekday and there was only a few tables occupied.  Only memorable dish was the crazy shrimp which is deep fried shrimp coated in sauce. Torched sushi was decent too.  Everything else was OK to subpar. This place is cheaper than other AYCE in the area. Service was decent as it was not busy."}
{"text":"Was really disappointed by my last visit here. My friend ordered a seafood udon and the \"seafood\" consisted of one single piece of fake crab and small piece of shrimp. Their sauces (for unagi, chicken skewer) were bland and they have a lot of rice proportionally for their maki and sushi. Their selection for lunch is very basic (no seaweed salad or ribs)."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for over 10 years, sadly this place is going to be under construction in July, as we were notified this past weekend as we sat down for dinner. I would go and try this place before it closes its doors and is reopened as an Asian fusion restaurant. Our family will still come back and try the new food once the changes have been made. I will always recommend people to come and eat here.?"}
{"text":"As a sushi ayce lover, I can say this place is well below average.  The menu looks amazing then when you get the food, everything is loaded with rice. Not only that.. It doesn't taste the same as other places. It's different, and not in a good way. Was my first time and will be my last. Neither of us enjoyed our dinner.  At least if the price was lower than average it would have been okay but it was on the higher side of ayce restaurants."}
{"text":"This place gets worse and worse every year. My cousin had her birthday dinner here (for like two birthdays in a row) and once again reminded me why?!  The spring rolls clearly came from a frozen package and served with a little plum sauce packet. Crunchy salmon roll just mean salmon roll with fried crumbs sprinkled on top. It's just ridiculous. This used to be a really popular place, but has since gone downhill. It wasn't even crazy packed on a Sunday evening, there were only a few tables occupied.   I hope to never come here again."}
{"text":"The sushi here is really good! I always enjoy my meal here & I've come back here a couple of times. I also even like their spaghetti :) & their menu does come with free drinks. The lunch menu is missing some stuff, like sashimi, but I'd come here for both lunch & dinner.  But it is a bit pricey to eat here, for dinner especially. & their soup noodles aren't the best. Other than that, I love it! The one of the best AYCE around the area."}
{"text":"Headline: Japanese restaurant owned by Chinese people with a French name # of Visits: at least 5 Last visit: sometime in 2013  Per my headline, it's about as good as you would expect for a place with a French name run by Chinese people making sushi.  Overall, maybe 2.75/5.  What I like: Decent AYCE price, plenty of seating, food comes out fast (I swear, one time we ordered 50 pcs of sushi and came out in less than 5 minutes, which is totally insane).  Kalbi is very good.    What I don't like: A few years ago, I would have said this place was \"da bomb\", but Yelp has spoiled me and their sushi isn't the freshest.  I wouldn't say it's bad, but it's similar to Sushi on 7.  Also, good luck asking for something like water, tea or checking on orders because they always miss two-three items.    Tip: Order lots on your first order because the 2nd order takes a lot longer.    Verdict: For the newb AYCE sushi eater, this is a great introductory, but for the more discerning, then not the best choice."}
{"text":"One of my favourite sushi places of all time. My family and I used to come here every week, we were so obsessed!"}
{"text":"This AYCE food is very average. But it's better then a lot of other AYCE Japanese restaurant. The service is very good."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been coming for years.  Everything is amazing. The sushi is very fresh and they have a great selection.  The kitchen food is just as good. I recommend the black pepper beef if you like garlic and the beef skewers are delicious too."}
{"text":"This restaurant is over priced for the quality of food and service that they offer.  The food is a sorry excuse for a Japanese food.  It is not an authentic Japanese food.  It was greasy, the breading was too thick, the oil and grease was just dripping from the food.  Their fried rice is bathing in oil.  Choosing this restaurant was a mistake.  Do not choose this restaurant at any cost, occasion or any reason.  If there was a negative star that would have been the rating I would give."}
{"text":"2 stars for okay-kinda-meh-sushi for price.  I go here fairly often with coworkers for lunch AYCE simply because it's close by and is good for a large group of people. Food is average (typical tempura, pretty good enoki-beef rolls, and...tater tots? What?), and sushi is okay. It's more of a buffet than a sushi place to me -- i.e., it's main benefit is that there's a whole variety that suits a spectrum of tastes, even for those who hate sushi. They also sometimes forget or delay orders, and we never know whether we should order the dish again (assuming that the order was left off).   Overall, I wouldn't make an effort to go here on my own time, but it's a decent place for a large coworker gathering."}
{"text":"Came here on Monday Civic holiday for lunch, the restaurant was barely a quarter full. My parents made a reservation so we were quickly set to a table.   We were given a paper to select our orders. We started with appetizers first, including salmon belly, beef and chicken skewers, edamame, fried calamari, yam and shrimp tempura, green salads. The beef skewers and beef in black pepper was very hard to chew. Other food was okay/meh. The best I had is the shrimp tempura. A while after all the foods came, we realized that they did not bring the green salads and we told the server about it. We also realized later on that we did not receive the korean beansprouts and radish that we ordered, so we included it in our second order. They won't give you the order paper even though foods were mostly finished on the table until you ask for it.  The second time we ordered salmon belly again, 1 salmon neck, 3 miso and 1 spicy soup, assortment of sushi, including hand rolls, maki, and 1 signature roll (forgot the name, it was cooked salmon, onion, etc.). This time, we were missing 2 miso, 1 spicy soup, the signature roll, and the korean beansprouts and radish that we ordered for the 2nd time... We let the server know again about the missing orders (soup only, should have told them about the korean appetizers too). He was speaking to us dryly, no apologies whatsoever. Their sushi and maki had more rice than what I have had in the past at other sushi places and it was very sticky in the mouth when eaten, and their hand roll was 2/3 filled with rice. As for the salmon belly, we got a salmon head (didn't order) + 1 salmon neck and didn't receive the salmon belly we ordered. Again, we asked for an order paper, and he said that it was last call.   Third time, we ordered ice creams. This time around we were given the exact about of scoops and flavours we requested. This is one of my worst experience at a \"Japanese\" restaurant. It was $17.99 per person on a stat. holiday, and I could have got it for $13.99 downtown for far better sushis. My family and I are not going back again."}
{"text":"As stated in many reviews, the service is fast but items that we ordered were missed. Spicy salmon wasn't spicy at all and I felt the wasabi was too mild, short ribs and salmon sashimi are great and I love that each table gets it's own full pot of tea and your not always asking for a refill.  Large seating area and tables and floors are kept clean."}
{"text":"An excellent all you can eat sushi place. They sometimes loose track of some ordered items. I suggest you order gradually, 2 or 3 items at a time, sampling their vast sushi menu. I also recommend that you insist on being seated in the main dining room. They have an overflow room in the back that is very dark and not so pleasant."}
{"text":"I was at this restaurant the 1st night they opened. The service was great, price was good quality was excellent, met the owner. I still continued to go every couple of years - to give it a shot. Now after 10+ years it is a huge disappointment. I hadn't been there for 3 years and decided to go back. Price is too expensive for the very limited all you can eat menu - most places offer over 100 items for less than what they offer. I would've thought they'd add more items by now. Quality is questionable and the service doesn't exist. You can sit around waiting & waiting and they don't take your plates or your order. Lunch or dinner...no difference."}
{"text":"OMG, this place is freakin' amazing.  It's an all-you-can-eat sushi/japanese restaurant, but it's not a buffet where you grab food that's sitting there for who-knows-how long.  Everything is actually made to order, the sushi and sashimi are fresh.   We paid $18.99 (Canadian $!) per person, so about $107 including tax but not tip, we had all of the following for 5 people (yeah, we're pigs): 4 pcs of gyoza 4 pcs of agadeshi tofu 31 pcs of sashimi 5 pcs of nigiri 12 pcs of maki 2 orders of beef short rib (kalbi) 1 order of black pepper beef 1 order of chicken teriyaki 1 order of tonkatsu 1 order of tempura prawns 1 order of fried scallops  1 small bowl of seaweed salad 1 small bowl of spicy bean sprouts 2 small bowls of edemame 4 orders of ice cream (they had green tea, mango, and ginger).  Oh yeah, and soda (unlimited refills) was included as well in the price!  Even with all the food we had, it was only a small portion of the very extensive menu that also includes udon, ramen, shabu-shabu, fried rice, etc.  Even our carnivore,non-sushi-eating meat-and-potatoes coworker loved this place (he did get 3 meat entrees).  The quality of the food is similar to any regular sushi restaurant, and just totally stomps on Todai and other asian buffets I've been to in the bay area.    They had servers taking your order and bringing the food, but they were very good and we got all our orders pretty quickly.  Just a quick warning, they do discourage over-ordering by charging you for leftovers, so definitely make sure to bring your appetite (and not your diet).  I do wonder how this place makes any money at all, but I'm definitely going to enjoy it if it's still around next time I'm in town (if it's still here).  I travel to the area for work 2-3 times a year, and this place is definitely worth a visit every time."}
{"text":"The sushi is really good and tastes fresh. I would recommend getting the arctic roll, beef teriyaki and black pepper beef. The service however is very slow and they tend to always forget a couple items you order. The items that do arrive come in amounts that we didn't ask for ( we would order 8 pieces of yam tempura and only 2 would come). The dessert selection for lunch is very limited but It's over a decent place for sushi"}
{"text":"Been here numerous times in the past and recently for my wife's birthday. Love the food and service. Just wish they offered soft shell crab."}
{"text":"The last time I was at this restaurant was over 5 years ago.    I was in the area on a Thursday night, with a colleague of mine and trying to decide where to go for dinner and AYCE sushi came to mind.   I had good memories about this restaurant but could not remember exactly why, and so I decided to renew my vows.   The place is still nice, price descent, food was fresh and service was fast.  They now have torched sushi which became one of my fav.  Shrimps were very good, whether tempura or deep fried in batter.    Scored a high 3*...   Competition offers a slightly larger variety, especially in sashimi.    I would still come back."}
{"text":"First time trying the a la carte menu and pricing was very reasonable!   Order two chicken run rolls and a yam tempura (total of 18 pics) and it came to $16.  Staff was also very friendly and food came quickly."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years with my family. Menu has changed over the years but I don't mind it too much. I do miss that Spider Roll though! Amazing service. My favourite comfort destination."}
{"text":"when I am starving, Maison is where the heart is....For 18.99, the all you can eat Japanese buffet, the menu seems endless.  The food is never disappointing, nor is the service, which is always efficient.  Though there was a minor renovation done a while back, the place is clean, and always a pleasure coming back to when I need my sushi fix...."}
{"text":"First customers of the day - the consistency of the food is what is strong. This restaurant is for Japanese food what the assembly line is for luxury vehicles.   Don't come expecting a personal experience with an attentive waiter, that isn't the style of Maison. This restaurant excels at delivering good food fast, very well suited for business meetings, groups, and families, all of any size, it's a sure fire experience that's always going to be consistent. Been 4 times so far."}
{"text":"Talk about a sketchy place.  It might have a fancy name...French n'all but when I walked in and saw a fold-out table right in the front, large wallpaper murals, peeling paint and old chairs; I knew right from the start that this place was going to be mediocre at best.  The food was okay.  The ramen noodles were good and so where the shrimp tempura. The portions were small and plated without care or attention.  The place focused on trying to feed people instead of impress them and give them a great experience.  My expectations were maybe set too high.  After reading over the other reviews all I can say is that if you're looking for a place that's cheap then this one is fine."}
{"text":"The AYCE lunch here was good - it costs $13.99 Mon to Fri for lunch. The place looks a little dingy on the outside but inside it's cozy and actually very nice.   No sashimi or seaweed salad on the lunch menu, BUT they did bring us really good galbi!!! I was so excited when they arrived...  We ordered the beef ribs teriyaki or something like that and it was just a plate full of shredded meat, very greasy and not soft. Don't recommend.  The rolls were good, your standard stuff - rainbow, california. I liked the special rolls - Arctic, volcano were pretty good!  The shrimp tempura was DELICIOUS.  Service was a little slower than i am used to at hockey or 168 Sushi, but still bearable.   I give this more of a 3.5 rating because it was nothing special, the service wasn't great and AGAIN they asked me if I am sure I can eat that much sushi. Are you kidding me right now? I do my job (order) you do your job (serve me) and we won't have a problem. There was nothing that really grabbed my heart here unfortunately... sigh"}
{"text":"Food was very average, but was brought out quickly when they remembered the orders, otherwise you'd have to reorder it ( which happened more frequently than i preferred)"}
{"text":"Horrible food. Slow service, quick to bring the low end fish and there's as thick as goo tempura...will not be eating here again..."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place. We have probably tried about 20 sushi places all through the Markham area and GTA. The service is great the food is great always fresh fish for the sashimi lovers and never a concern. I'm not a fan of the chicken teriyaki as is a bit fatty and oily (chicken is always hit & miss in Japanese restaurants I find) same with some of their beef and soups. But this could very well be because I'm an extremely picky eater who usually stays with organic meats.  It's dine in or pick up, no delivery."}
{"text":"This is my first time at Maison du Japon, I've been struggling to find a decent Japanese ayce resturant lately. To my surprise I had a much better experience here then at some other ayce restaurants in the Markham/Richmond Hill area. The sushi and specialty rolls are pretty good and I really enjoyed their cooked dishes.   One of the main reasons why I wanted to try this resturant was because I saw they have torched sushi. But I was quite disapponted with the torched sushi. It was over-torched, and was like cooked fish on sushi rice."}
{"text":"Arrived an hour before last call for lunch ayce with a group of friends. Food came out pretty quickly. I would give the food 3/5.. it wasn't very satisfying. Service was very poor. The restaurant was not even busy. Our finished plates were starting to pile up. Servers would pass by our table many times and didn't take away our finished dishes. Some of the servers were just standing around and doing nothing and chatting amongst each other. We received an order of yam sushi which we didn't order but they kindly took it back. I've been here once before and it wasn't so bad. It was a big let down to us to come back here to see that it went down in service and went up in price."}
{"text":"Not my favorite AYCE sushi restaurant, but a decent choice if you are in the area. Price is reasonable, but not many options beyond sashimi. They charge for drinks here as well. No free pop. The freshness leaves some things to be desired. Easy to get bored of the food here. The deserts are decent, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Great service. But this might be because we ordered a bunch of stuff in one go. We rarely had anybody come back to ask us again for more food.However, it was surprisingly on how a good amount of our food actually came to the table. The sushi was fresh as well. May go there again."}
{"text":"Great place for AYCE Japanese food.  The service is fast.  Great value for lunch. Lots of selection.  I enjoyed most of their dishes, especially fries golden eel and pepper stake.  Their shrimp tempura used to be excellent but now they mass prepare them.  So it' not as great but still good.  Tip: bring a pen and mark the menu.  That make ordering very quick and easier."}
{"text":"Great lunch outing.  Maybe I'm a bit biased as my lunch was paid for and the company amazing but I enjoyed everything we ordered... and we ordered plenty. We got there a little before noon, which turns out to be the sweet spot because shortly after we ordered the place was packed. Service was fast and pleasant, the place really nice and clean.   Lots of choices, favorites for me were the eel and spicy crispy salmon rolls... and the teriyaki short ribs... and the calamari....  So much menu still left to try I will be back, likely often."}
{"text":"As someone who is not real keen on sushi I was uncertain as to what I would expect for their menu selection. Have to say this place far exceeded my expectation. Terrific food, my favourites in particular are the beef teriyaki, gyoza, chili chicken, and they have the best house dressing for their salad ever!"}
{"text":"Nothing really special about this. They have lots of variety and options to choose from but the flavours are pretty mediocre. Not sure why it was so highly regarded for top sushi restaurants in Markham. Drive a little more and you'll find that your money will be better spent at ten-ichi and yellowtail. Torched series is underwhelming."}
{"text":"Lots of selection. Very tasty.  Service very good.  Have not beenthere since renovations, but is very large. Very accomodating.  Worth a visit. Try the spicy crab and tuna"}
{"text":"If you're an avid sushi fan, don't go here. I went here today for AYCE lunch. Yes it's cheap, but I certainly wouldn't say you get any \"bang\" for your buck! Selection of fish is very limited. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I say it's decent. It's better than all the all you can eat sushi from downtown. I like size of the place. It's big and not too crowded. The selections are great and the drinks are included in the all you can eat menu. The only thing I dislike are  their rolls. Last time i went there for some reason the rolls were so big.  Overall it's great place to eat. I have no complains about it. It's definitely one of the top 10 all you can eat in Toronto, but not the best on my list."}
{"text":"We had terrible time the cooked food was prompt but the sushi and sashimi came late and there was not mango pudding"}
{"text":"I frequent ayce sushi places around the Markham area. This place is the most consistent (though be it never changing menu) that I have found throughout my last 5 years.   If you can't decide where to go, or if you need a place to take people to and want to make a decent impression try this place!  The biggest plus about this place is fast service, consistent quality and the waiting staff are friendly and FLUENT in both CHINESE and ENGLISH.   The waiting staff are unmatched by all other ayce sushi in Markham. If you have friends who do not speak chinese this is the place to go for their sake."}
{"text":"Good seating, decent food. AYCE is getting pricey for the quality you get, but still not a bad place to bring a big group of friends. Service is decent, and it's not overly crowded or loud. I've been there twice and would go again, but I'd rather try other places if I had the choice.   Had spicy tuna roll and tempura dinner, tasted good, but nothing particularly memorable."}
{"text":"pretty good AYCE japanese food.  for the price you pay, M-F $11.99 for adults, you get pretty good service and quality food.  there was a wide selection of food and the menu was in chinese and english, making it easy for my parents to read and order what they want.  i wish their sushi had a bit more variety though, but i guess you get what you pay for at an AYCE joint.  the sushi rice needs some work though.  it was cold and hard and didn't stick together too well.  i was not a big fan of the ramen though.  the quality of the noodles sucked.  i guess i was expecting a little too much out of a cheap AYCE and wanted some authentic japanese ramen.  then again, most of the waiters here spoke chinese and the menu was in chinese as well.. i wouldn't be surprised if this place was owned by chinese people!  as for dessert, they had ice cream (green tea, ginger, mango).  green tea was a little too creamy for my liking.  mango one wasn't too bad.  be careful with wasting sushi though!  they have fine print at the bottom that states for every piece of leftover sushi, they'll charge $1!  i'm not sure if they actually charged since i didn't look at the bill, but i guess it's still a good idea to not waste too much food."}
{"text":"What can i say, for AYCE Sushi this place is definitely up there but does have one or two quirks.   The overall environment is nice, clean, with plenty of seating and nice decor. They offer a wide variety of items to choose from. From your hand rolls, fake crab, grilled meats, to even torched sushi - which you have to try.   Went with a large group Wednesday evening, no issues with getting our reservations and the staff were quick with our orders.  Yes you will be filling out your order by hand, but ... its not a big issue. The menu as mentioned earlier is large with your general selections. Availability for certain items do vary depending on what time you go **.  Personally everything tasted great. The sushi temperature was on point. Not too warm like its been laying around for a while. Not too cold like those old gas station ones. Every shrimp item we ordered was amazing. Short ribs got an approval. The torched sushi was the best.   Some the quirks we noticed was that the salt level was a bit noticeable. The shrimp tempura batter could have been better. The dessert selection is basically ice cream and \"mousse\" ( whipping cream -_- ), only the mango ice cream was worth it imo.   Is it 5/5, no. Would I recommend, yes. Would I go again, yes."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times in the last 3 months. On weekends for dinner,  a la carte only. Good service, food is good, the waiter staff is polite and prompt.  Not sure why all the dissapointed reviews from others.  I'm not new to suishi, and everytime i go here, its not bad. Maybe for AYCE, they skimp a bit, but should taste the same, maybe portion wise they skimp.  Parking is ok for weekends."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Lunch prices are very reasonable and the quality is fantastic for an all you can eat place.  Service is alright; atmosphere is alright too.  If you're not coming here for lunch be warned that the price almost doubles for an all you can eat dinner."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times over the years. Service is always great, its never too packed and a great AYCE if you don't want to wait. Everyone is fluent in English, which is not always the case at restaurants in the markham area. Food is always good, but not great. At my most recent visit they added  torched sushi which I enjoyed. Great variety of food but I have had better sushi and sashimi else where. Like I said, a great place as a back up plan or last minutes dinner decision. Overall, I will continue to come back here"}
{"text":"My fam and I keep coming back here for AYCE sushi. Will be coming back here again for my dad's bday soon.   Service is always efficient & fast. Love the selection & the sashimi is sooo fresh & delish! My favs are... Eel Fried Rice, Spicy Salmon, Spicy Crispy Salmon Rolls, Artic Roll (must try!!), sushi pizza, the list goes on...The price is also not bad! They used to have the spider roll (my absolute fav) but it has been discontinued.  The only thing I hate is feeling full after the meal lol"}
{"text":"I was quite surprised reading the other reviews because out of the three times I've been to this restaurant, I've had wonderful experiences. I've been there with different people every single time and they would definitely return.  The prices during lunch weekdays are pretty cheap and the food is served very quickly. The staff is everywhere, but I recieved everything I ordered.  The food is pretty good, but they do seem to try and \"spare\" the fish, especially in my rainbow roll - which I've had many times at other sushi restaurants.  On a good day, I would enter and leave within 20 minutes due to the fast service. Will continue to go."}
{"text":"Look people: When you go to AYCE sushi, realize that for less than $20, you WILL NOT have the best dining experience. For example, the fish will not be as plentiful and every dish on the menu will not be made fresh from scratch in the kitchen. The reality is, there is a room full of people who are eating tons of food and there are cooks who have to keep up with all of these orders. Also,in order to provide people with as much food as they want, it requires a lot of budgeting.   If you are looking for an incredible japanese dining experience visit an a la carte establishment. When you pay $20 for a spider maki at a higher quality restaurant and despite the fact that it may taste excellent, you will realize how much of a deal you are receiving at AYCE joints.   ----ANYWAYS----  Maison Du Japon is one of the better AYCE options for me. The dining room is bright and open. By my standard, the food is great for an all-you-can-eat restaurant. I have zero complaints. The selection of possibilities during lunch is incredible. As usual, there are some items that are reserved for dinner service, but this only makes up a very small portion of the entire menu.   Weird name, but good food and good service."}
{"text":"I used to be in this area alot and my wife and I were frequent diners here,   Super super fast service. Like seriously it'll be on your table in 45 seconds. Sushi Ninjas I tell you.   I agree withother posters saying that they rice their stuff up alot. When I get my sushi, I just take half off the rice off...No biggie."}
{"text":"Toronto driving is pretty crazy and I must confess, I was driving crazy fast trying to get some local beer at different LCBO and we got there roughly 45 minutes before Closure. This was a sporty AYCE Sushi marathon with ridiculous quantities in No time. It was good for a AYCE and there was a lot of choice. The service was quick and good."}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten here in years but the place is still the same. The food is decent & prices are reasonable. It's not the best sushi I've ever had in my life but it's also not the worst. I'd say food quality is good in general. I love their Garlic Pepper Beef that is so delicious. Some maki rolls we ordered to share (Red Dragon?) were a bit skimpy on the salmon placed on top of the rolll. But otherwise everything else was good. Waitstaff bring food promptly & clear away empty dishes promptly as well. Everyone is polite. My only pet peeve for this place is the ladies washroom is always freezing cold. It feels like sitting on a block of ice when I sit on the toilet seat. For the love of god turn up the heat a little bit in the ladies washroom! Guys don't need to sit on the toilet to pee like we do! Sorry if that's TMI. LOL."}
{"text":"My most recent (and second time) eating at Maison du Japon for Lunch on a Saturday was less than ideal. As I had arrived prior to my friend getting there, I was seated. Not 2 minutes later a waiter tried to put 2 handrolls on my table. I had not ordered (nor did I intend) to order a single thing before my friend arrived. Our first order took nearly half an hour to arrive and plates came sporadically (one after 15 minutes, 2 after 20, and the last part half way into our second order). On top of this, parts of our orders mysteriously vanished or were given to other tables. This makes it obvious that they did not have enough control over what order was for what table. Strangely enough, most of the other tables (who were Asian) seemed to get their stuff quicker despite ordering 10+ dishes per round. Unfortunately this seems to be a common trend I am noticing with AYCE sushi spots and I'm very disappointed by it. We started ordering around 12:45pm and left just before 3pm. If you're going to charge a premium on the weekends for lunch (without offering any different items) you must staff the restaurant accordingly to ensure customers receive their orders in a timely manner."}
{"text":"My visit was very great, their a little bit expensive depending on the time of day, it was about $24 per adult at the time I went. But their food was great, food got out fast, but almost half of it got out a late.  I would definitely would love to come back."}
{"text":"Relatively quick service, good variety of food.   Their quality seems to be inconsistent and is either great or OK.  Make sure not to go there near the end of the shift (2:30pm or 10pm) as they usually close up shop early if there are not many people there."}
{"text":"Nice all you can eat place in Markham. The restaurant is very clean and modern, pricing is fair, food is great (but lacks the wow factor) and the service is just average. I have definitely been to better AYCI Japanese places and its too bad you can't get Sashimi on the lunch menu..."}
{"text":"This All you can Eat joint has had me wanting more everytime i've been there... To be honest the Maki rolls and sushi rolls I find are a bit less stuffed than i'd expect and a little too much rice action going on for my taste... But none the less its fresh and QUICK... BE WARNED... if you choose to order ALOT at once... it will all come out seconds apart and can be quite overwhelming... The seaweed salad is light and fresh and i do recommend the spicy korean soup in replacement of the miso as it has a nice kick to it... My favourite roll, crispy spicy salmon i will have to say is not the best.. BUT The Sashimi is to die for! melt in your mouth good! I've been craving it since... honestly a great all you can eat joint and def a go to! dinner time will run you 30 dollars but definitely worth it... honestly worth the price no doubt!"}
{"text":"Another decent AYCE Sushi joint, that is also pretty good otherwise. Selection is good, the wait staff is kind of iffy and confuse your orders a lot, but this is not a big problem if you are going for all you can eat. One of the better Japanese restaurants north of Steeles."}
{"text":"I got the Yelp app just to write this review. This is the worst all you can eat sushi place I've ever been to. The rice to fish ratio is terrible, the types of fish is very limited and the service is the worst! They never clear your table and the manager is extremely rude and this isn't even going into detail. If you want to experience shitty all you can eat, go ahead!"}
{"text":"OK, but nothing exceptional there and no Tuna in the AYCE menu! Desserts are not good."}
{"text":"The food here is truly horrendous. Went for lunch and pretty much every dish raw or cooked comes with either mayonnaise or soya sauce. I mean just looking at the food made my stomach turn. Heed my warning."}
{"text":"If you like all types of sushi with avocado added, this is the place to go. Everything is \"______ sushi with avocado\". I, on the other hand, find all those avocado to be out of context."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday afternoon for AYCE sushi.   We were seated in a smaller room which, unfortunately, had a huge birthday party going on. The party consisted of many little kids and I felt like I was sitting in a chuck e cheese.   Asides from the environment, the rolls that came were extremely hard and not fresh. 20 pieces came within 5 mins during a busy period - I assume that the rolls are premade so it's not fresh.   Anyways, I was so uncomfortable with the seating and food that I left after eating those rolls. Definitely not coming back here for anything ever again."}
{"text":"Still a great place for items you usually can't decide on. Especially when your friends are very confused on what to eat. Still one of the best all you can eat Sushi in the GTA."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of AYCE. The selections was quite good at first glance. I came here based on recommendation from my coworkers.  We were lucky to be seated right next to the sushi counter and when we saw how they made their sushi rice, we lose all our appetite!  The sushi rice were all fed into a machine where little dumpling of rice coming out from the other end.... and then the so call sushi chefs put the pre sliced fish on top of the rice.  Just like the previous viewers they messed up our orders too...  I would not come back to eat here anymore!"}
{"text":"Maison Du Japon takes up a huge space in the corner of Woodbine and John. In addition to having a huge dining room, they actually have an event room in the back in case you are hosting a private party/event. There are screens in the room as well as a karaoke machine (I think?).  I've been coming here once in a while for years now. Back in the day (before the days of iPad menus), Maison was pretty good and probably one of my favourites because they had a huge variety. Nowadays, there are many other options for all you can eat, with amazing quality for a similar price, and Maison just doesn't stand out anymore.   If you happen to be coming here regardless, their arctic roll (available all day) is actually really good and isn't heavily loaded with rice."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner buffet with family and friends and we practically overindulged ourselves.    The menu - fantastic, enough choices to satisfy our personal cravings and was surprised with some gastronomical adventure as some of the stuff are new to us: Arctic Maki Roll, Wizard of Oz, Gold Dragon, et al.  The service - efficient and friendly.  The food - one of the most tasty and satisfying Japanese ever; big portions, too.  A kick for every buck.  Telling my other friends about it and we'll be back!  On the downside: the wasabi wasn't hot enough and the tempura sauce was tasteless - for me at least.  I may have had better Sashimi in other places but they have more selections.  Never  mind the unsophisticated interior that kinda felt like the owner had other business priorities but the food is worth coming back for.    We paid $20 per person which happens to be the rate from Monday to Thursday.  Price goes to $23 per person on weekends.  Children under 9 yo pay special rates, and Senior discounts too."}
{"text":"Maison Du Japon: the AYCE sushi place named with French flair.  Je ne comprends pas, though I *am* a sucker for sushi.    I've made the pilgrimage to Maison du Japon several times based on recommendations from several friends and coworkers.    Conclusion?  Tres inconsistent.    I've had buttery fish, I've had sinewy fish.  I've had dishes come out quickly, I've had long waits (and also several instances of missed items on orders).  I've had hot and crispy tempura, I've had lukewarm and soggy tempura.  I've had generous portions, I've had skimpy servings bulked up with rice.  I've had great service, I've had - meh - pas-very-bon service.    So, where does this throw us out?  At the pricier end of the AYCE options, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat at (English translation here) the House of Japan.  However, for those who have yet to have an AYCE experience, there are many many options here, and the location comfortably accommodates groups.  Yelp note: despite a mixed review, I must strongly encourage - beseech, even? - you to, if you make it to 7500 Woodbine, order the Arctic Rolls.  THEY ARE THE BEST, and have transformed my last visit to Maison Du Japon to a purely AYCEAR (all you can eat Arctic Roll) experience."}
{"text":"First things first: why is the name of the restaurant Maison Du Japon? How am I supposed to believe that this sushi restaurant is authentically Japanese, if you are going to incorporate French in the name?!  But I digress.  The ordering system is handwritten checkbox system using the paper placemats underneath your plates. I found this process pretty awkward since there's a lot of cutlery you have to take off your placemat before you can make an order... I'm not totally against the non-electronic traditional ordering system, but would prefer a more convenience.  The sushi had really thing slices of fish on top of the rice. This was pretty disappointing considering places like Kaka and Kiku which (although more expensive) make an effort to have decently proportionate sushi and maki.  The worst part was that in addition to the rice overload, the rice wasn't even that good. There wasn't enough rice vinegar, and it was just too dense and sticky for my tastes.  The entrees were really really oily. I guess most AYCE sushi places are like this these days.  The menu was not the most varied I've ever seen, but it wasn't the most uniform ever either.  If you are coming to Maison Du Japon, do order the specialty rolls - they taste pretty good (mango sauce!) and are worth the price you pay.  Service was pretty fast, even though it's AYCE and we came at a busy hour.  TLDR: Come here if you want cheap, but I would personally pay more for immensely better quality AYCE sushi...   Merci beaucoup."}
{"text":"It had been about 5 years since I last came here. I was excited that I had another chance to go because I remembered that this place served some really bomb sushi.  Whether my memory failed me of not, this time, the quality of the food was sub par; pretty bad in fact. All the rolls and sushi we ordered felt dry in our mouths. The sashimi did not look fresh either(I have a hard time discerning whether sashimi tastes fresh). The tempura also tasted dry, even with the tempura sauce (no idea what it's actually called). I'll be honest, the only thing I enjoyed was the short ribs, and even those were mediocre at best.   Not sure what happened, maybe it was just a one-off day (although judging by the other reviews, it doesn't seem likely).   Ultimately, would I go again? I've got my nostalgic fix from this place. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Masion Du Japon has one of the best sushi in York Region. Their sushi is amazing filled with flavour, each sushi roll as a significant strong taste to it that makes you want to have more. If you like sushi I believe that this restaurant would satisfy your sushi craving, also their presentation with the sushi is great, they always have a nice layout on their plate with the sushi. The rice that's on their sushi is great, you can really taste the quality.  The disappointing part about this restaurant is their waiter service is not consistent, there are times where I would go and the waiting service would be great and times the service would be disappointing.   All in all, their food is amazing I highly recommend people to go there due to the great sushi they serve to their customers, you will not be disappointed with the sushi you will eat."}
{"text":"Good quality sashimi and sushi but the options was not as much as some other sushi places that I went. The seats were a little bit too close to each other. We went for dinner and we were so lucky to find paking after a few spin around the whole plaza. Overal was good, try black onion pepper beef, it was yummy."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. I came here for a weekday AYCE dinner. Looking at the menu and the prices, it would be best to come here for lunch instead.  This is your definition of average AYCE Japanese food. Comparing this restaurant to its closest competitor right across the street, Fushimi, it's clear that Fushimi is a superior choice in every single aspect.  Firstly the service wasn't terrible but the missed orders and giving only half the portion of sashimi I ordered are big no no's. I can't say the place was understaffed with 3 waiters but I felt like the place wasn't very welcoming. The manager didn't do anything for us all night except greet us goodbye.   The food did come hot, which I was very happy with. But the ordering system...  You have to use a pencil and mark down a number besides the menu item you want to order. So I put 2 next to the chicken wings and got 2 pieces. However, when I put 2 pieces of X tempura, they gave me 6 pieces. The menu should have said how many pieces per order the dish is if it's not 1 piece per order. Having made this mistake for several items, I was forced to eat more than I thought I ordered.   Food quality-wise, like almost everyone said, the food was just OK. I would say the desserts were the best, the raw fish, handrolls and meat were average, noodles in soup were above average even though I thought the portion was too big for AYCE. The sashimi selection told me quickly how budget friendly this restaurant was. Also, the green tea tasted more like water. You can usually tell the quality of the Japanese restaurant based on the tea they serve. I didn't try the sushi but from the looks of it, I think it would be OK as well.   I would not recommend this restaurant because of the service quality, the food quality to price ratio and how much better the competition of Japanese food in the area is in comparison. Who cares if they include pop in the menu if the food is mediocre?"}
{"text":"If I could give it ZERO stars, I would.  Horrible place. Although this place IS AYCE... it still doesn't beat the AYCE places you can find in L.A. Maybe that's just it. I am spoiled by the mass quantities of variety in places I can dine in that actually taste good and offer great service. Mind you, there will be places that have bad service... but the food will more than make up for it.   First off, the word Maison... isn't that French? I was thinking it was gonna be some weird French Japanese fusion place or something because I HAVE gone to that type of restaurant in Pasadena, CA (Maison Akira) and that was great. But no, I was disappointed when we were handed an AYCE menu. I was actually very confused because there were Korean items on the menu as well AND the place seemed to be Chinese run.  Moving on, the place had these sheets of papers with the items that they serve on it. Our party of 25 gladly ordered all our various items of interest and they soon started to come on out. Of course, the staff passed out our various items to just any table they felt like, without checking who the items belonged to. And, of course, some of us didn't get what we ordered because they didn't care to look and see who ordered what and give the correct items to the correct people. With that being said, we asked where our spider rolls were. The waiter that just so happened to help us was QUITE rude. My mother asked, \"Excuse me but, we didn't get our Spider Rolls.\" He then replied in his angry Chinese accent (yes, this place is Chinese run... not even Korean), \"We no have spider!!\" My mom says, \"No, spider ROLLS. We never got them.\" He then yells again, \"We no have Spider for one year!!\" My mom and I both tell him, \"But its on the menu.\" He agrily says to us that we should have ordered off the menu that was printed on our place mats (mind you, we were handed paper menus to write on when we were seated... we didn't even see the place mat menu since our dishes were ON it). We said, \"No, someone handed us paper menus to write on.\" He, seemingly frustrated with us (for who knows what), says, \"No!! That OLD menu!!\" We then get irritated and snap back and say, \"Well maybe you should update your damn menus or cross the item out so we don't expect it to come when we order it!!\" And then he turns around to look at the other half of our party, just snaps at my cousin and says, \"What you want?!\" My cousin just said, \"I don't know what you're talking about.\" She had no idea what was going on over on our side but she asked the waiter, \"Oh, can you check and see what else is coming out of ours?\" He angrily replies to her, \"You no keeping track of what you order?\" She got upset and said in response, \"Don't you keep track of what you're serving?\"   That's the last time I will EVER go there... and yes, the food ain't th at great."}
{"text":"I am pretty disappointed in this place. We came in on a Sunday and although the restaurant was pretty dead it took a good 5 minutes for us to be seated.  The sashimi I ordered was still frozen and the wait staff left much to be desired. Half way through our meal they started cleaning everything and the whole resturant stunk of bleach, kind of took my breath away. The rolls wernt bad, but was not worth the $25 price tag and half hour wait for the bill."}
