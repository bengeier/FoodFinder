{"text":"I'm not sure why this business isn't already on Yelp, but it should have been a long time ago. Their website says they opened in 2013, but I only just saw it today and went inside.
Though the decor is lacking (there is only one TV and one menu board), the owner (Yusef, who goes by 'Joe') is a sweet man who loves to talk to you about his family and ask of yours. Extremely friendly! 

I ordered two Lebanese meat pies and one large Donair. It took a bit of time to make everything but I wasn't in a rush and Joe keeps you busy by chatting.

The pies were excellent, I'm sure they would have been even better if I had eaten them right away but I brought them home to my father. Normally we drive to South Calgary for our meat pie fix, but I don't think we will have to do so any longer! Joe makes sure that everything is kept hot while he makes your order, since he's the only one working. (At least during my visit).

Joe doesn't skimp on anything when it comes to donairs. The large one that I had gotten was quite literally the size of my forearm! Lots of meat and veggies and sauce. My dad said it was really good too.

The food here is 5/5, but with the atmosphere is 4/5 since the shelves were pretty much bare and there wasn't any kind of decor.

If you need a yummy lebanese fix, I'd suggest going here. They also serve other ethnic foods (which might seem quite strange), but there are things like Jamaican beef patties, Samosas, Greek food etc. 

Very nice little place and I look forward to coming back!"}

{"text":"Did not enjoy the food there at all. The beef tastes old and dried out. The sauce and bread were stale. The only reason I am giving the 1 star is that they give you a tonne of food for $10. I ate the large and I could barely finish it. I do have to admit I am basing my review on a one time visit. But I thought this donair was so poorly executed I will not eat there again.

But I guess if you like your food bland you will love it. :) Good Luck"}
