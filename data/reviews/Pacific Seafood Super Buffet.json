{"text":"We went there yesterday evening and found the experience to be mediocre at best.  The buffet has been going down hill since it opened with last nights meal being the worst.  Many of the food items were dried out or mostly empty.  The sushi section was bare with only a few items available.  The staff appeared uninterested with the service being sub par.  Too bad, they started out great...this buffet is not worth your time."}
{"text":"There was a cockroach strolling on my table while I was eating.  When I asked the waiter to remove it, he waited for about 30 seconds,  like he was waiting for the bug to just crawl on its way. After my demand to remove it for the second time,  then he picked it up with a napkin.  I've been eating at this place for several times now, and this was the first time I encountered a bug. Once is more than enough.  The manager said it was sprayed a few days earlier, which made the roaches to come out and more active.  Awesome."}
{"text":"First time trying them out as they have only recently reopened. It is a favorite of a friend's though and he was very happy to see them reappear on the culinary map. 
I was very impressed with the large selection. The food was very tasty and freshly cooked. The sushi was excellent and the cooked fish was still moist even after sitting under the hot lamps for a while. 
I would be happy to return even though I can guarantee my friend will be choosing it as a place to catch up."}
{"text":"Very nice surprise!  A little selection of food but it was actually very good. Love the fried rice and the shrimp..."}
{"text":"No wonder this place open and closed so many times.  'Deception', The sign say \"seafood\", but it is just another ordinary oriental buffet.

The food is ok; the price is ok; plenty to choose from. I would have given it a three star,  But I cannot get over this feeling I had been; HAD,  deceived,  suckered, (maybe its me. I dunno, I just have a hard time getting over it)

I am going to give it a one star for deception. This is definitively NOT a seafood buffet; it is simply another oriental buffet. Remind me of a cartoon; the crook in jail said, \"I am an honest guy\""}
{"text":"I honestly loved this place. The food was all very good. The people were all so friendly. I came to visit with my friends and we all loved it. They have a huge selection. Nothing is made in too big of a portion and its all very fresh. There are even some very surprising items on the menu. :)"}
{"text":"I've been here 5 times in the last 2 weeks every time it's been good and they have changed out different and better food items. The best buffet I've been to in a long time"}
{"text":"Shitty food, not very good service. Never return. This place is NOT good. Expensive with no Good Seafood at all."}
{"text":"Went to this buffet for lunch wanting some crab legs and fried shrimp. For sure a \"seafood buffet\" would have these two seafood staples. Much to my disappointment they had neither on the lunch buffet. What I found was just another Chinese buffet, though the quality was better than others I've had.

Not a fan of any chinese buffet and the only thing that would cause me to go back is if it were in fact a seafood buffet and not a chinese buffet. The reason for my three star rating is I feel the name is deceptive as it is just chinese buffet with a name indicating it is something else.

Not bad if you know what it is and that is what you're looking for."}
{"text":"#DoNotEatHere! More like BARFet! The only word I can come up with to summarize this experience is GROSS! #PacificSeafoodBuffet is on Dysart north of Van Buren across from Peter Piper.  The \"food\" is not safe for consumption.  I refuse to allow this place to go unreported. Any establishment who does not have enough respect for their customers to serve safe food does not deserve the public's patronage. We went there tonight expecting to enjoy crab legs and they STUNK! They were spoiled. The beef and broccoli was soggy even after they brought out a new tray the orange chicken was more like sour breaded fried dumplings, the rice was hard like it was from two days ago,the pizza was hard and the salad was wilted. The only tolerable food was french fries and that chicken on a stick."}
{"text":"So we have come to this place a few times now and each time it has gotten worse.  Today was the final straw.  One of the hot tables was completely shut down, no food out at all.  The rest of the food that was out was over cooked, nasty, bull sh@t!!  The service has absolutely not friendliness or inclination that they are happy you are there as a customer.  I had to ask the server for every refill we had and had to ask for the check at the end.  At no point did this person ask us if we needed anything.  When the drinks and bill were brought he simply slid them onto the table as he walked by.  I have not experienced any bugs here yet, but it would not surprise me.  We will not return to this place again.  The sad thing is that it is so hard to find any decent Chinese food in Arizona.  Everyone do yourself a favor and not eat at this location.  Let them go out of business please."}
{"text":"Dont go here. I love seafood and wanted some good shrimp and crab. This is not the place to get it. Food is bland. Fake crab is smothered in cheese...really disgusting.  Eggrolls were nothing spectacular.  You could buy better ones premade at the grocery store. Even the salad bar was sad. Cut up sandwich meat. Possibly expired dressing that tasted just wrong. The employees seemed nice so I feel ok about giving the one star. But thts it..this place is awful. $20 for two people. Your better off going to Chili's or Olive Garden. ."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch a couple of times and it has a great variety of food. Anywhere from Chinese food, sushi, Mongolian BBQ, some American food, a salad buffet and a dessert bar. Some much food so little time and unless you want to end up with a couple sizes bigger on your pant size, I'd recommend taking it easy and trying a little of everything. I know but it's a buffet, I'm just giving you the warning. Anyways, I liked the Chinese food which was decent. Sushi was good. And the Mongolian BBQ was good also. Worth the money if you like buffets with lots of different foods."}
{"text":"Well there is food and a lot of it. About 20% of it is edible the other 80% is questionable. The fragrant and aromatic scent of rotting meat hits you as you walk in the door. The room temperature seafood will keep you coming back for more. NOT! go somewhere else. This place is no good!"}
{"text":"Literally the worst in the area. I like Chinese food a lot but thus was overpriced with tasteless food. They got my one time donation but I won't be back. I have been in Asia, and this looked like third world fish! GROSS. They had \"escargot\" the size of giant turbo snails - the chicken was tough, the rice dried out, the food literally tasteless. If this is seafood it is for the bottom feeder. Priced way to high, and kids 10-12 are charged adult prices. The sushi was ok - and the best tasting thing was the canned pudding. I literally almost warned a family as they walked in, wish someone had warned me before I dropped almost $40 on a buffet for 2 adults, 1 kid and we all left hungry."}
{"text":"I'd rather have EBOLA. 

The truth is, this place has gone downhill quickly. Nothing is EVER labeled right. The dishes are either cold, or over cooked. The prices seem to change slightly depending on who the server is at the time, and the iced tea tastes like it's made with recycled teabags. 

One time we saw a roach, it almost took my wallet. To say it's dirty would be giving dirty places a bad name. I'm a fat guy who likes buffets, but this place had me packing it up before I even finished the first plate. 

Don't be fooled into thinking that this is like Pacific Seafood & Buffet in Tempe or on Bell Road... it's kind of got the same name, but lots of shame in its game. 

Seafood here means overcooked fish and stale sushi. If you want crab legs, go at night, and pay a lot more for dried out crab legs. I guess if you are looking for a selection of 6 different shrimp dishes that all taste exactly the same, it's awesome. 

If anything here was \"cooked fresh\" that clearly means BEFORE it was shipped from overseas... AVOID, unless you like vomiting."}
{"text":"Immediately upon walking in the door you are slapped in the face with the horrific smell of sour fish. While this is called a \"seafood buffet\" you will find its nothing more than your typical Asian style buffet. The food was tasteless and bland. The selections were thin. Save your money. I tried nearly everything offered and have nothing positive to say about any of it."}
