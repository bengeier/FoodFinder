{"text":"The Pros and Cons of Chang's Chinese Buffet...

First time in this area of Phoenix and decided to stop by here on a whim. Small place, doesn't look like much from the outside.

The food was however beyond my expectations! I tried everything, literally everything on their buffet table and it was all delicious. The chicken was crispy, the pork was juicy, the beef was tender, and the veggies were crispy and tasted fresh.

But, the fact that I was able to try everything on their buffet table is sadly the issue. They're buffet wasn't really varied. Maybe 10 things tops. And for the price, I feel they could have had more on there.

Still, if you find yourself in the area, I strongly suggest it. 4 stars in my book because I'd rather eat 10 things that were well made, than 20 things that were rushed and poorly made."}
{"text":"When it comes to buffets this place certainly lacks variety. You will find your typical sweet & sour this or orange that and not a whole lot else. 

But the service is wonderful. It has a mom & pop kind of feel to the place. The egg drop soup is perfect, not too thin and not too thick. And the prices are low."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness this place is so good! I have been looking for good Chinese food since I came to this area and I finally found it. It's a small place but the food is hot and delicious and the restaurant is clean. And it was only $5.95! I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"First time here and the food was great.  Everything was fresh and what wasn't, was replaced with something that was in a short amount of time.  I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Buyer beware there was several things that took place at this place 1 the food was gross the temperatures were not hot on the food line they kept putting new food on top of the old food i SAT and watched no telling how old the pork is on the bottom and especially not being kept at the right temperatures they just kept putting new food on top of old food but the new food coming out was not that good and anything that costs a little more they kept pretty much empty like their broccoli and steak the whole time I was there for an hour and a half they never refilled it but they refilled the cheap stuff the dessert barwas gross chocolate pudding that was pre poured into little dishes they had a bowl of plain red jello and  bananas that were unpeeled sitting in a bowl and hello that was your dessert bar the people were friendly the place was clean while I was there for people from the kitchen and the restaurant sat down and ate a special meal they prepared specially for them none of them got things off the line lol can you blame them they know it's no good good luck getting refills when they're on their break they sit there and eat and pay attention to no one really I thought this is a restaurant don't you take care of your customers first they had five tables filled and for the workers we're sitting right in front of you eating and no one to take care of the customers I had to tell the man hello you have someone at the counter that wants to order he was there for a few minutes but they never noticed until I told them the other thing I saw which was a big turn off there is an elderly Asian man with gray hair that came outside from the heat wiping the sweat off his face with his hands and then putting dirty  hand and grabbing a cup and put it down in the ice machine and then filling it up with his drink he never use ice scoop like the other employees I was so disappointed in this place it was clean that I was worried I was going to get sick because you don't know what they do with the food especially by putting the old on the bottom and when I got there I ate most the stuff on the bottom and then I watch them put the fresh on top really if you want to have a restaurant they need to step it up and I didn't like the looks I would get every time I go up to the buffet I kept hoping to find something that would be good but theres selection was few I don't know how this place got good reviews it certainly wasn't because of the food maybe because of the staff being nice I have tried this place twice and I now will never return the price is cheap but the food is trash hopefully they will learn from their mistakes"}
{"text":"This place was awesome if I and my family would say...first the price was not bad 6.50-8 if you get a drink...the food was pretty good I love noodles and if I dont like the way noodles look I won't even bother staying well noodles looked good So we stayed and very surprised noodles looked and tasted great, egg roll was delish, orange chicken was bangin had perfect crispy taste with a little sweetness yumm, honey glazed shrimp was my and my son's fav and I usually don't eat it at other buffets because it looks sketchy but my son who is 11 said it was awesome and was it ever and my hubby who is hard to please with the atmosphere/ambiance of a restaurant really and I mean really like this place yes looks like a hole in the wall and doesnt sit a lot of people but sometimes the smaller the place the better it was very cozy. So all in all try this place hopefully you will be just as satisfied 

p.s. the lady that helped us was very nice with good customer service"}
{"text":"Great value, delicious food! This little neighborhood restaurant is family owned and operated and has great service. Although the selection isn't huge, what they do offer is delicious. I live in chandler and today 2/4/13 is my second time coming. Great place to stop by before going to the drive-in theater to catch a movie!"}
{"text":"So happy this place opened next door to my house. Excellent Orange chicken and spare ribs. All u can eat, good price, owner very friendly."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today because of the reviews on yelp. Wow u guys don't know Chinese food if it bit u in the twat/balls lol I'm just talking about the food here, idc about how small it is or what is looks like as long as they are clean and the food is good.  Food was dry everything!! They put ham in their chow mein WHAT?!! And rice which I never experienced before. The egg roll had so much pepper in it, it tasted like those salt and pepper kettle chips lol that was weird. The sesame chicken just looked and tasted like fried chicken nothing sesame about it. The food to me was just gross. I don't recommend going here."}
{"text":"family owned .always a plus

I love small neighborhood buffets like Changs those 'great wall mega plex buffets are like eating in a bus terminal ...also the food here is good, fresh and hot and the staff are attentive but as others have stated not a big fan of the TV"}
{"text":"I'm sorry what am I missing here? I followed the reviews and decided to try this place. It's genetic Chinese buffet fare, nothing special. Many of the reviews state small buffet but the quality is great. The only thing that was great was the price. Sesame Chicken didn't even have any sesame seeds on it very little sauce and basically dry. Orange Chicken, no orange flavor just sweet, again very little sauce and again dry. Teriyaki Chicken was dry, not much flavor. Egg Drop Soup, just eggs no vegetables. Even the Tea tasted like it had been sitting in a pitcher for too long. If you want actual quality and not quantity I suggest for two bucks more... Lim's on Greenway rd. Sorry other reviewers, this is not quality."}
{"text":"Great place small and good food 
Would definitely eat here again 

food is filling good flavor and for 5.95 for a lunch buffet cant beat the price"}
{"text":"Very good Chinese buffet style food.  If you remember David Kwan's around the corner from more than 25-30 years ago, this has almost the same style.  I don't know if it's a style of cooking, but I could never find Chinese food that tasted similar to David Kwan's after its closing.  It must be a crazy coincidence a similar tasting Chinese joint opened around the corner; walking distance.  

Either way, if you're looking for some decent and affordable Chinese buffet style.  Give it a try!

I always recommend getting it to go because you will fill up fast, but they skimp on take out.

A no frills, small, but good quality Chinese buffet.  Not some Mega Buffet."}
{"text":"Consistent, affordable, tasty! Both egg rolls and spring rolls yum! Sweet and sour pork is nice!"}
{"text":"Most disgusting Chinese buffet I have ever seen in my life. I blame myself partially. There were only a few cars in the parking lot, that's how I  broke rule number one in the buffet. Only two tables with people inside, rule number two. At least I did walk The very short food line and saw how disgusting the unstirred food was. Don't waste your time. I did not even eat it looks so nasty."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. I honestly go here a couple times a week. It's very convenient location, I live right down the road. They may not have a huge variety of food, but what they do have is amazing. The chicken and broccoli and bbq is super delicious. The main lady who works the front counter is super sweet."}
{"text":"This was my first time there. The male owner of the place seemed nice and I got the Buffet. However, the chicken was under cooked and the sweet aand sour pork was hard, dry, and way over cooked.  I sked the female owner that I was not satisfied with my meal and asked if she could make me something from the kitchen instead.  She stated that because of the cost , there was nothing she can do, kind of like buyer beware. I told her I was  on Yelp ready to write a review. She quickly changed her tune and offered to refund my money for the meal only. Got stuck with a $2 soda that was not drunk. Went next door to sonic but wish she just would have made me something fresh.  No customer service from her!!"}
{"text":"Nice little Chinese restaurant flying under the radar in Glendale. The food was above average. In addition, it was very clean! I loved all the entrees. My wife and I will be returning soon. Lunch is 11am-4pm. You can't beat the price! It's small inside and extremely casual."}
{"text":"Thank God for locals or this place would close. The buffet was terrible. The crab Rangoon's the worst I have ever eaten. I had to keep asking about items being fresh because everything was no longer hot.  The buffet is super small a total of maybe 20 items. I swear I think people do not have taste buds. This place is awful. Yuck!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese buffet this side of Hims. Forget the decor, forget the size of the joint - the food more than makes up for any conceivable inconvience you may think up. The price is right, sure they gouge you on the drink price - they all do - but get water if that gets you butt hurt. Like I said, the food is killer here. I'm coming back, hopefully it's not crowded when I get here."}
{"text":"Really dissapointing after years of driving by and thinking, \"Hmmmmm.  I bet that little place is delicious. \"  It's not.  Immediately upon looking at the buffet, I had concerns. The soup had a thick skin on it, the ribs were so dry they were cracked, and the spring rolls were dark brown.  The fryer oil tasted as though it hadn't been changed in weeks, and all varieties of fried chicken dishes tasted identical...very odd and kind of dirty.  The condiment bottles on the table were absolutely filthy; sticky with dark brown grime. The ladies' room was clean, albeit with a table and chairs stored in it, but my husband said the mens' room was dirty.  Sadly, this restaurant was sorely lacking in most aspects, from friendliness to food...we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Because of the good reviews, I decided to check this place out for myself. There were 3 other cars there waiting for Changs to open, so I thought that was a good sign. Very small inside, and not much of a selection. I guess I expected more than 9 dishes to choose from, including rice and vegetables, & pudding. The recipes of the dishes they did have seemed kind of bland. Not a big fan, and will not be going back."}
{"text":"Nice and fast takeout !! Everything just like David Kwan's 20 years ago.
Cozy eating area if you wish to eat in.  Tons of buffet items available and good price, One takeout dinner can feed 2-3."}
{"text":"This place is off the Chang! Seriously though,  the food is really good. Even though it was a buffet,  it was all very hot and fresh,  and made in small batches so it didn't sit as long. And 6.95 for a dinner buffet?  Who does that?! I saw a few people recommend the walnut shrimp so tried it.... Yeah... Epic..."}
{"text":"Chinese restaurants are generally a hit or miss. You will always have your one spot go to Chinese restaurant that has always been nothing but satisfactory. This buffet was alright for the price you pay. 

Pros:
Very clean environment.
Food was well prepped.
Quiet and enjoyable.
Cheap for all you can eat.

Cons:
- Server only refilled drinks 1 time.
- Could do with more varieties of food.
- Wasn't really a fan of any of the chicken.

We chose this place because the Great Wall or whatever was closed down. I'd recommend this place to family or friends."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Certainly nothing fancy on the outside or inside, very casual. If you are looking for ambiance please stay away. If you are looking for excellent Chinese food, come on in!  It's your old authentic Chinese buffet that is excellent.  There are plenty of items to choose from, not like the ones with 80 options & kids have run their hands thru all of them.  Not sure what the comment(s) about hockey puck egg foo young are about, every time I've gone there they have been fresh, hot and very tasty. Possibly if you've gone within an hour of closing time some of the items are not going to be real fresh, what buffet puts out a fresh spread 1 hour before they close?! We are heading to Changs tonight for dinner and am looking forward to it."}
{"text":"I went in for a late lunch one day and the food seemed like it had been sitting around for a while and looked picked thru.  Other then that everything was just okay.  It will not WOW! you or make you want to go there a couple times a week.  This place is minimal at best."}
{"text":"Based on previous reviews we decided to come. We ended up very disappointed. We came in for lunch. There were not many options. Most of the food was very bland. It's was a cheap price which I guess that's good. But was very surprised that my one year old and 3 year old were charged. It wasn't much but how much can a 1 and 3 year old eat. Nothing pretty much. Customer service was average. Honestly I wouldn't come back to this place."}
{"text":"This place never deuces to amaze me. Small  but very good. Always warm, always fresh... Yum"}
{"text":"Small buffet but food is all really good. I love the hockey puck shaped egg foo young. Nothing extravagant just really good Chinese food. Less than $10; Changs buffet is a seriously great little spot."}
{"text":"We were looking for av place to eat after a trip to the mall and this came up as an option. Nice staff. Good food. Price is right! I am sure we will be back."}
{"text":"i would seriously take this place over any chinese food mega buffet. those places usually smell weird and are horrifically humid. am i wrong?

yes, the buffet is small. but the food is excellent, and all the meat dishes are accounted for. the sesame and orange chicken have a crispy texture and just the right amount of sauce. they have a decent almond shrimp offering. i also thought the chow mien was very fresh.

the owner is extremely friendly. they only opened a few months ago, and so far they're breaking even. i hope everyone will stop by and give this place a shot so these nice people can actually bring some money home for their hard work."}
{"text":"It's $5.95 for the lunch buffet and that ends at 4pm. The dinner buffet is $6.95. We came for dinner and although it's a small buffet you can actually see that as a positive since everything goes rather fast and therefore is replaced quickly - making it fresher than most buffets. In addition, the orange chicken and chow mein are to die for here! The honey fried shrimp is grand as well."}
{"text":"This is a great little Chinese buffet in Glendale it's always quite busy on Friday and Saturday nights you cannot be a $6.95 buffet"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for years!!They have excellent food and prices! The food is Always hot and fresh! When you get to go they even hook that up!They are not greedy at all !Customer service is great Always greeted with a smile and very polite! ! I would definitely recommend this small Chinese spot if you're looking for great food and great prices! !"}
{"text":"No stars from me at all.  My 15 year old daughter and I went to this buffet on 11/27/2015.  We went here 2 weeks ago with some friends.  
When my 15 year old and I walked in and started to pay for lunch, the owner publicy embarrassed my daughter and I.  The owner abruptly and rudely in a loud tone told us that last time we were here, he was watching us eat and that our party of 6 wasted his food and we all didn't eat everything on our plates.  The owner also said that we all ate to much.  The owner stated that his lunch buffet was only 5.95 and that he hasn't raised the price in 5 years and that we wasted a lot of his food.  My mouth dropped to the floor in shock.  I said excuse me.  I couldn't believe, not only his rude and horrible comments he made to me in front of my daughter but also the embarrassment in front of his guests whom were already dining.  The audacity and such unprofessionalism was such a disgust to myself as well as my daughter.  I advised the owner of his lack in customer service and the disgusting and embarrassing comments he had made to us loudly in the restaurant and in front of all his customers and employees.   I advised him we will not be back EVER and that many people will hear about our horrific experience and horrific treatment at this buffet.   Therefore, I do not in any shape or manner recommend this buffet to anyone.   My daughter felt very saddened in the way in which we were treated, as well as myself.  No restaurant is worth this type of embarrassment and humiliation in which we received.  We went to Shangri La on 28th Avenue  and Cactus.  Dine in , non buffet and was treated with upmost respect and dignity.  Thank you Shangri La !!!!"}
{"text":"Ok this place is a small family owned mom and pop shop, my favorite places to go! The food is old school hand made with love the way it was meant to be! I love it, small, quaint, amazing food, great caring owners you can't ask for more.  Seriously handmade egg rolls and egg foo young, egg flower soup, noodles and ham fried rice just to mention a few is so good!!!  Give it a try"}
{"text":"After visiting so many super-buffets with Rand, it is kind of refreshing to try a smaller buffet for once. This one is new, clean, has a neighborhood restaurant feel about it, and even offers outdoor seating. They offer a little over 20 items, mostly decent though limited (like I said, I guess I got too spoiled with super-buffets). A nice little addition to this commercial area at the Phoenix-Glendale border."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. We stop to eat at changs at least twice every single time my family and I are in the area. Always coming back. Also love that it's not crowded most of the time."}
{"text":"Today my wife and I ate lunch at Chang's Chinese Buffet for the first time, and it will be our last.  The food was simply terrible.  It all tasted like everything had been deep fried in old cooking oil.  Even the egg roll was awful with a very thick doughy exterior.  Although the lunch buffet price is only $5.99, our bill for two came to $16.99 with drinks."}
{"text":"Walking in this place the first thing I notice is that it is tiny, the buffet is small, and it's a bit dark.  
However, the food was pretty decent and very filling. It's easy, uncomplicated, and the narrow selection means the the individual food is better opting for a more focused quality to the food. 
The price is always good, and it gets the job done. 
Only reason why it is missing a star is because of the interior was pretty dark and old. 
If you want a good enough selection of food, dirt cheap buffet prices, and an easy selection you will like this place."}
{"text":"For 5-6$ you can not beat this place. Small selection of some delicious Chinese food for an amazing price."}
{"text":"This buffet is small but don't mistaken it because of the size of the restaurant. They also have special if you don't want to eat as the buffet. Not many variety of food but its still a great little place to grab some Chinese.  Will back again, hopefully he added more food."}
{"text":"extremely clean buffet. its small but it makes up with taste. theres not a ton of options but they are really good for the ones they have. 
What i like about this place is the price. you will pay about $7 per person. 
The stand out was the Lemon Chicken(alot of though but delicious glaze they put on it). Orange chicken and fried chicken.
Dont be scared by the looks of it outside. It might not look like much but you will be pleasently surprised."}
{"text":"Yes, this is now our go-to place for Chinese! Very, very nice staff, clean dining area and superb food. 

The buffet is always on point, hot and delicious. I appreciate being checked on as well as to drink refills - very polite people to say the least.

This place is awesome value, for under $10 you get all you can eat and the variety of choices of food is great. This is a small place that goes big on food. Try it sometime"}
{"text":"If you're looking for pretty good pudding and horrible greasy Chinese food, this is the place to go.

I was tricked by the good reviews. 

First, let me say the staff is very nice and attentive, and the location very clean. When I got there, the place was packed, so I was thinking it should be good... Unfortunately, the food was terrible. Everything was either extremely greasy, or knobbly with unchewable fat. This is one of those places that uses that cheap sweet and sour chicken for EVERYTHING. The Crab Rangoon had absolutely no filling in them. The orange chicken tasted like it just had some Maple syrup poured over sweet and sour chicken pieces. I wish I had a tooth brush with me to get the taste and greasiness out of my mouth immediately. 

The pudding was pretty good, though."}
{"text":"The fried rice and lo mein weren't bad. Everything else tasted the same regardless of the labels. The hot & sour soup was neither. The review where this is compared to David Kwan's of 30 years ago is nuts. This place only compares in the title of Chinese Buffet. He must have been a friend of the owner. It was $20 for two of us and it was at least $10 too much. As the tuna commercial used to say, \"Sorry Charlie \"!"}
{"text":"Very good and nice variety, friendly staff and you cannot beat the price. Staff was quick to check us in and the water is free. It was only $16 for two people which you would pay for one of the bigger places for one. A very nice buffet and amazing food."}
{"text":"This place was one of the most unsanitary places I have been to. It was not clean, a low variety of dishes, and service was average. I've been to several buffets and this has been the worst one"}
{"text":"My boyfriend loves this place! I finally caved and went with him and now I love it too! It's small, food is tasty and the lady who works the register is so sweet and always looking to make everyone comfortable. I appreciate her willingness to put everyone first. The pork BBQ is my absolute favorite and the spring rolls are delicious. When we bring our 1 year old, he enjoys the fried rice and pudding. Everything is so good that you could easily make yourself sick from over eating, so be mindful of that. We love coming here. It's like our dirty little secret that we tell everyone about :)"}
{"text":"When you enter this quaint little buffet you are greeted  (my best guess) by one of the Two owners (again I am guessing) a husband and wife team and maybe a dishwasher. She is reserved yet friendly.Directly to your left there are 4 booths that seat 4 and the rest are tables that each seat 4. (I'm sure if you had a group they would hustle to accommodate whatever arrangement you chose.  Rand H. and I paid and immediately chose a seat . We sat in a corner booth. I ran straight to the food and got some Hot and Sour soup. It was perfect!! I also grabbed some of the entrees. Yummeeee!!

Okay 4.5 stars !!!!! This quiet little buffet with 23 items and a capacity of 28
was a pleasant meal where I was actually able to try everything except the fried chicken and the fried fish (wasn't in the mood) Egg fu young looked like a hockey puck but was Tender and TASTY . . . plain or with the sauce! Thanx Iain B. for nudging us to try it!! because of work I'll not be partaking with Mike C and Rand H. on our next usual Monday buffet run. =( so anyway I personally didn't miss the salad ... a star crusher for the great and mighty \"salad loving\" Rand H. I also wonder about Mike C's feelings for this place because he is ALL about the DESSERTS. they had 2 kinds of pudding and 1 or 2 kinds of jello.,. WHATEVER I'm with iain B. if a small but sufficient dose of Chinese Buffet is what you are down 4. Come support one of the worthy small businesses in your hood!!!!!!!!! This is what makes America Wonderful!"}
{"text":"I didn't much care for their lunch buffet. I don't eat pork or beef so I did miss out on a large portion of the selection. As far as the chicken goes, many had said they enjoyed it. I found it to be overly breaded, giving it a dry fried flavor. I probably won't go again. I felt sick after. If you like eating healthy in any way probably stay away.."}
{"text":"My friend and I had a craving for some Chinese buffet so we ran a search of places and found this place.  From the outside, it is nothing really exciting and the inside is really not too exciting.  It could use some updating (Torn booths, presentation) and I had texted my wife before we started eating, \"We are here eating at Chang's in case I get food poisoning\" because I thought there might be some problems.  The buffet was small and there was a small dessert section (three items- Chocolate pudding, Jello, and canned peaches).  The owner/cashier/server was really nice, even explaining to my friend what was in some of the choices he made.  I liked the sesame chicken, orange chicken, walnut shrimp, and the fried rice with pieces of ham.  The staff was really attentive and made sure our used plates were quickly off our table and refills were consistent.  Overall not a bad experience, but the first impression was a little shady.  On a side note, I did end up getting food poisoning, but I am unsure if it was the alcohol later or the food, but I did end up on the toilet from 3am to later at our hotel room (see my motel 6 review for a little more info).  I would probably go back to Chang's and give it another chance, but I need to do it in secret and not let my wife find out or I will never hear the end of it!"}
{"text":"Wife and I having Chang's chinese food. Good atmosphere, Great service, Great value and Awesome food! Thankyou guys!"}
{"text":"The food was great, the place was clean, and the price was great! Worth the 10mile drive, we will be back again!"}
{"text":"Small unassuming place.  Almost didn't go in...  but dang!!!  Delish!  The very small buffet had just the right assortment of -veggies-fried-steamed-stir fried-
The owners were SUPER friendly. What they lacked in size was made up w food quality for the very reasonable $7.50. Like omg, not fancy but cheap and filling and fast, and isn't that why we go to buffets?   Love"}
{"text":"I work right behind this building so I am ALWAYS here for lunch. I LOVE this place, and the staff are SO friendly. The only bad thing I could say is that, they are closed on Mondays and find myself craving Chinese Food on Mondays."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, and at a fair price. It's been a long time since I've gotten good chinese food at a low price like this. I will keep returning."}
{"text":"Great food great price only place I know to get all you can eat for $6.95 dinner on Friday."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place because of the yelp reviewers being so positive, but it was honestly nothing special. In fact, it's one of the worst Chinese places I've been to, ever. I'm not sure if those who review this place are writing honestly after today. If possibly, I wouldn't give it any stars. Yes, it's Cheap. But you get what you pay for. On our way home, which is about 10 min down the road, I had to pull over twice because the food made him sick. 

It can barely be considered a buffet. There is maybe 15 items, including soups and deserts to choose from and everything just about tastes the same. The jello is good, but it's hard to mess that one up, and nothings fresh. Taste and quality is not there, at all. It's not worth getting sick over. I definitely don't recommend this place to anyone.

That being said, I will give credit where it's due. The staff was very friendly and attentive- bussing and clearing tables and refilling our drinks right away. The host busses a booth for us, and sat us right away. They were very nice! But we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Aloha Hawaiians, 
You must visit this place super ono food and the price is awesome. 
Do not eat before you come here because you going kanak attack after lunch. Even the take out is awesome. Mahalo Changs."}
{"text":"At the urging of some of my Yelp friends I made the trip over here for lunch yesterday.  As I quite often do I got there just a few minutes after 11, would have been sooner if I had not driven by it once.  When I got there all the trays were full of food.  Everything was hot.  Nothing I sampled seemed old.  While there was nothing extra to write home about I found all the food to be prepared well, including the hockey puck looking egg foo yung..  The orange chicken stood out because the batter was lighter than normal.  I missed any ice cream for desert but I enjoyed the chocolate pudding.  At $5.50 plus the drink I found lunch to be a good value.  My plates were cleared in a reasonable amount of time.   The only thing I would change would be to offer one rotating item showing off the cook's skills.  Even though it is a bit of a hike from work I am sure I will be back again some time."}
{"text":"Closest Chinese buffet in my area.  This place is overrated, the food wasn't any good.  Would have never though it would be this displeasing."}
{"text":"So we used to go to David Kwans many years ago and we were so upset when it burned down! So happy to see they are back, same recipes AMAZING! The only negative thing I can say is that it took me this long to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Having family fun day and picked this place using Yelp. Great job previous reviewers this was yummy for my tummy. I would've given it 5 stars but it lacked good flowing air conditioning and this is Arizona. If your taking it to go winner winner!"}
{"text":"Took me by surprise. Very small, cozy and clean. Good food and worth the price. Staff was very friendly. I will go back again."}
{"text":"It is a small buffet but they more than make up for quantity with quality! With-out a doubt it was the best Chinese buffet I have ever experienced! As mentioned from an earlier reviewer - do not be afraid of the \"hockey puck\" egg foo yung... it is actually great and wow the walnut shrimp is epic!"}
{"text":"It's a hidden Gem open for 5 years go for lunch or at 5ish for the Freshest Dishes."}
{"text":"This place has that mom and pops feel to it.  It is small and so is the selection, but the food is great.  Very friendly service and the prices are cheap.  Clean place too."}
{"text":"Tiny, but this is definitely a place that cared about quality over quantity. Plenty of meats to choose from, all super fresh, even when we went at like 3 p.m. they were still bringing fresh food out for like the 3 or 4 people total in the restaurant. Fantastic BBQ Pork and the eggrolls definitely have a homemade feel and taste."}
{"text":"This was such a cute place. The food was good, owners kid friendly. Very cozy and relaxed atmosphere. Not your large over the top buffet. We loved it!"}
{"text":"Vern G wrote about this place so on a whim we went. Small Buffet but great food. The service was amazing. I think this will be added to the list of places we go frequently."}
{"text":"We just happened to find this place and I am so glad that we did. If your looking for a cute little hole in the wall chinese buffet then this is the place. The food was amazing at an excellent price , and the customer service and hospitality that we were given was outstanding and everyone had a smile on their face. Chang's Chinese Buffet is definitely true to their tag line; \"come hungry,  leave happy \" . I highly recommend Chang's , don't let the area scare you away. 

Also the bathrooms and seating area was extremely clean , everyone was very polite and the staff even interacts with the guests . We will definitely be back , definitely glad that hiking North mountain gave us an appetite and we stopped here ."}

I really enjoy Chang's Chinese Buffet,  off 43Ave in Glendale, stop by for lunch or dinner, this family restaurant offers a buffet that adds dishes daily.  The hours are nice because the place is open a little bit later than most restaurants.  Everything is worth a try and when i eat hear I'm always getting a 2nd or 3rd plate.  

jessica C. one star review, hmm, she has one review and non of her 6 friends have more than one review, that s why I love yelp, bogus reviews are easily seen."}
{"text":"Looked on Yelp for a chinese food place near the skating rink, came upon this place, figured we'd give it a shot. Good choice.

Decent prices, food was just as good as you can get at most chinese buffets, staff was very nice.

The standout was the crab puffs; they were quite delectable.

Prices were decent, and the quality was sufficient that I'd recommend it to anyone in the area looking for an affordable chinese buffet."}
{"text":"Read all the reviews on Yelp and thought I give Chang's Chinese Buffet a try. With a 4 star rating, I was expecting 4 star quality food. Well, some of it was good, but some of it could be better. First of all the atmosphere was pretty nice. It almost felt like Cheers, where everyone knew your name. Even though we didn't know anyone there, everyone talked to one another. The T.V. in the corner drew most everyone's attention. You could tell who the regulars were. They were up front and closest to the T.V. 

Most of the food was fresh. The Shrimp was very fresh and tasty. The rice was also seasoned probably and tasted almost as good as back East Chinese food, it just wasn't brown. Orange chicken was good, but a little hard. Not as moist and juicing like I wanted. The chicken was dry. It was flavors well, but was dry inside. Seems like it was under the heating lamp too long. The sweet & sour soup was good, but I've tasted much better. The egg drop soup wasn't too good though. Spare ribs weren't bad. Also a little dry, but not as bad as the chicken. The Egg-foo-yung was not good. Hockey puck shaped or not, it was too watery and didn't taste like real Egg-foo-yung. Everything else was pretty average. For the price, it wasn't bad. I would go back and eat there just so I could have the rice and shrimp. So pretty much 2 stars for the food and 1 for the atmosphere, service and cleanliness. Place was very clean and service was decent. Not a 4 star restaurant. Barely a 3 star. I think my wife gave it 2 stars. If you go there and find certain foods you like, it's probably worth the $5-$6 to go back and eat as much as you want of those particular foods. Skip the bad stuff and eat all of the good tasting foods. Other buffets will run you $10-$15, so this place could be a gem if the food gets better."}

{"text":"I should start by saying Chinese Buffets are not my favorite, but the rest of my family likes them. Chang's is small, but the family that owns the place is very friendly. Food is the typical fried expectation. If you're a fan, Chang's is a good choice. I was going to give them 4 stars, but the hubs was looking over my shoulder and said I had to give 5 stars saying, \"I love Chang's\"."}
{"text":"Good buffet food, friendly staff, great price. Good buffet food, friendly staff, great price."}
{"text":"I have been coming here periodically the past 8 years. I will tell you it is good they try and make fresh food. The lo mein noodles are the best to me they're pretty fresh. The egg rolls okay, the barbecue pork slices we're good. I do not frequent buffets any more. I had a craving for lo mein and egg rolls so my husband and I  decided to have dinner  here. I will never ever make the mistake again to eat this food in the evening, my husband and I could not sleep for anything and that was hours after we ate the food. One other thing,   I only got a little bit of food but felt like I ate a humongous plate of Thanksgiving dinner.  If there are fillers in that food they definitely fill it up with something. Like I said if you want to eat buffet food this place is okay but be forewarned DON'T eat this in the evening whatever you do. Well duh I just Googled why I couldn't sleep after eating Chinese food and the big MSG is the culprit so if you are sensitive to MSG don't do. I'll never  do this again. I have to go to work and I only got a couple hours of sleep last night."}
{"text":"This buffet was very fresh and only $5.95! I was in the area giving someone a ride, and it was lunch time. The place was clean and the food was very fresh. I'll admit I didn't like the orange chicken because the batter was a bit thick and super crunchy and lacked enough sauce to moisten it up. But, for a small and CHEAP buffet, there were enough other things that I liked that I was fine. It's certainly not the best Chinese food I have ever tasted, but it was definitely worth the six bucks!!

They had orange chicken, sesame chicken, beef with veggies, chicken with veggies, huge fried chicken legs, bbq pork slices, sweet and sour pork, egg rolls, spring rolls, sweet and sour soup, egg drop soup, and MORE! They also had freshly made egg foo young. I really liked their fried rice as it had peas, carrots, eggs and it even had pork in it! I also like their lo mein because it had veggies in it. 

They had a dessert bar with chocolate pudding, fresh cut watermelon and jello squares. Also, grab a fortune cookie on your way out! 

It seems that the husband does all of the cooking and the wife takes care of customers. 

I won't go drive across town to go here, but if I'm in the area again, I would go back. I always have $6 in my pocket!! A much better choice than fast food, and less money!!"}
{"text":"Really really good food for the price. It all seems fresh. Chicken and veg. Is really good. Noodles are authentic chinese lo mein and loved the sesseme and fried shrimp. Lived near it 3 years and questioned the place. Now I just feel like I missed out until now"}
{"text":"Great prices!
Great food.
Small buffet, but family owned and good food.

No negatives.
Small and cute."}
{"text":"Not only is this the best old-school Chinese buffet in the valley, it is the BEST Chinese buffet in the valley. Believe me (much to my wife's dismay) I am an expert in this area. Friends have suggested I write a guide to the best Chinese buffets in the country (yes, I find Chinese buffets when I travel too... even in Europe). 

The selection at this place may be small, but the quality is good. There are a few things they could do slightly better, but what they do well is better than any place else. IMO their fried rice and lo-mien are standout items. I love their BBQ pork, although some may find it fatty. The teriyaki chicken is not very teriyaki-ey (is that a word?) but it is not bad.

When you take into account the price it increases the value even more. 

It was mentioned in an earlier review that this place reminded them of Kwan's that used yo be around the corner. I liked that place as well, although it could be a bit scary at times. The owner of Chang's and several of her family members used to work for David Kwan, and is still friends with the Kwan family, so I suspect that is why the similarities exist.

To those who complain, there are always going to be off days, or you will go at the wrong time. A few they will be haters because they are haters by nature, but I think that most will find this a great buffet."}
{"text":"I ventured to Chang's based on the Yelp reviews.  It's a small place, but is clean, and there were plenty of open seats when I arrived.  As mentioned in the reviews, I found that the selection of food items was rather limited, but I knew that going in.  The pricing is on the low side, especially for a buffet, so if you're hungry and on a tight budget, this place rocks!

The reviews I read mentioned the hand made egg rolls, and they were the highlight for me.  They were large, flavorful, crispy, with the deep fried \"blistered\" skin, and when dipped in the sweet and sour sauce...YUM!  I also liked the BBQ pork (chashu), egg foo young with savory gravy and the chicken broccoli.  I was a bit disappointed in the orange chicken and sesame chicken, which were a bit bland.  

The service is great, and they manage to keep the food trays loaded.  There are better places, but if you stick with the standouts--egg rolls, BBQ pork, chashu, egg foo young, you'll have an enjoyable meal at a VERY affordable price."}
{"text":"Chang's Chinese Buffet is one of the better Chinese buffets I've had the pleasure to eat in Phoenix. It's rather inexpensive and less for lunch; very reasonable. The food is cooked fresh because I see someone from the kitchen replacing the older food that has been sitting in the  buffet on a regular basis. If there is something that looks old and dried out, etc. just ask the owner or whoever's serving and they will be gracious to bring out fresh.
The buffet consists of just about every Chinese food imaginable plus hot soups and desserts. I always pick up a fresh ripe banana in the desserts section. 
Chang's serves Oolong hot tea and it's so good I drank four cups. 
In a hurry and have a craving for Chinese food, give Chang's a try!
No outdoor seating that I know about."}
{"text":"Only have a one star because I couldn't put none. Not a well put together Buffett. I like my meat and rice hot not cold the way it was served. Sorry but I'm just so disappointed. I went off of the reviews here but boy were they wrong."}
{"text":"Great little buffet especially for the price. Food is always good and so is the service."}
