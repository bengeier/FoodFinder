{"text":"Great food. Tasty and delicious.  Standard menu along with sushi and duck dishes. Lo Mein is mostly noodles not half of all other stuff like vegetables,  bean sprout.  Great sweet and sour chicken. I go back many times and enjoy it every time."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today and had one of the worst experiences ever dining out.  I had ordered two lunch specials for me and a friend.  1st, friend ends up cancelling, then the food comes and it really tastes bad.  The portions are very small and the food came just soaked in extra, extra sauce.  So I asked to take the other lunch home and put it in a to go container.  Then a patron couple decided not to eat & grabbed my food and ran out the restaurant. Oh shit right, no the store did not take it of my bill.  They proceeded to take my credit card and still charge me.   Bad food, bad area, and very bad service."}
{"text":"shrimp tempura was okay..i've definitely had better.. green tea was amazing.. service was okay.. i wont be back for the tempura though..presentation was good.. but yeah just 3 stars..2 are for the green tea.. service was soso.. nothing spectacular about this place."}
{"text":"The staff is really nice. I have been here about a dozen times and I always seem to order the General Tao Chicken. Delicious."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  Husband threw his kung pao beef in the trash.  Soon wouldn't eat his cashew chicken.  The salt amd pepper wings were bland.  My honey walnut shrimp was ok,  some of the walnuts tasted rancid though and it was a bit too saucy even for me.  Wish I could have my $50 bucks back"}
{"text":"The absolute best. Great service, amazing fresh food. I drive across town 30 minutes to eat it. I'm addicted. I moved out of state for a year and never found anything close. The very best, if I was rich, I'd hire them to be my personal chef ha-ha."}
{"text":"The food and service here is really great. The prices and portions are unmatched. They make the food the way you want it not just the way it is. Nice clean and family ran."}
{"text":"Wok My World is one of the best little Chinese Food places here in town. The only downfall is the neighborhood, it's pretty rough. But it's worth it. My family and I eat here a couple times a month. They know our order off the top of their heads. They're very personable and they are truly very nice. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Besides Wo Fat...this is one of the best Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas!! They open from 10:30-11:00 so I know that on my late dinner days I can eat here! It's a family owned restaurant and they are very nice which is a bonus!"}
{"text":"Wok my world has pretty tasty food.   My husband and I, decided to try their take out service, and the food came hot, big portions, and it was pretty tasty.  I tried their kung pow chicken, and potstickers, won ton soup all were very good, the meal came with noodles or rice, fried or steamed.  The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 was because it took over an hour to get are food delivered.  Otherwise we will be back."}
{"text":"Small family owned shop. Not much here but the food is great and the employees are friendly. Been going here for years now, always good. Bbq pork fried rice n boba is why I started going here but everything I've had here is really good, although, I don't eat seafood so idk abt that."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I'm from Massachusetts and am used to hole in the wall spots that have great food. I am so happy I have finally found a place like that in Vegas! Great service, excellent food,  good prices, and good portions.  The boba and teas are awesome too I highly recommend this place. We ate there the first time and picked up a few orders. Hidden gem"}
{"text":"NEVER ever ever ever AGAIN!! Absolutely the WORST Chinese food I've ever had in my life! I'd like to start off by mentioning that there is a $7 delivery fee- and it took them an hour to get here. I ordered fried rice, lo mein, chicken wings, and an eggroll. STARVING, I open my food and I'm beyond repulsed when i find a HAIR in my chicken wing! Gross. To make matters worse, the rice is hard and the lo mein is ridiculously bland. I look inside the bag for some duck sauce & soy to fix it, and can you believe they only send ONE pack of soy and no duck sauce???! The fried chicken was not your reg. Chicken wings u usually get it but was breaded and tasted equally as awful as everything else. Just when I thought they couldn't mess up anymore I look at eggroll and it's not a eggroll but spring rolls instead.  I called them and complained about everything and they simply said 'so sorry'. I'm absolutely disgusted with this place & just finished taking a nasty dump after I forced myself to eat it bc I was so hungry. AVOID at all costs! Sorry for the TMI but it was absolutely necessary. Lol"}
{"text":"The place itself is a bit of a hole in the wall, but the food is great. Super nice people. :) I typically order delivery. It usually takes about an hour or so. It's a little lengthy but worth the wait. Their wings and fried rice are my go to favorites. :D"}
{"text":"Favorite chinese in Vegas! Excellent portion sizes for a really good price, delivery and pickup times are fast, and the food is super delicious. My favorite is the orange chicken with the actual little mandarin oranges in it :-) Also, I think it's important to mention that the owners/employees are lovely people, and have always been super freindly on the phone and in store. The inside of the store isn't anything fancy, but that really doesn't bother me. Oh and my toddler LOVES thier smoothies!"}
{"text":"First time but not the last! We went to try out this restaurant that was near our house. We usually go to china a go go but we wanted to try something new and boy were we satisfied! We ordered crispy duck, beef broccoli, combo fried rice, and shrimp tempura lover roll! Everything tasted fantastic (this coming from a family that always eat Chinese)! They make everything fresh so they taste a lot different. We also got a FREE choice since ordered $10 or more so we decided to get the homemade green tea and it was delicious. My husband and I always order jasmine green tea at the No. 1 boba and would even drive all the way there just to buy some! Now all I have to do is drive down the street from my house! It taste exactly the same as the one in chinatown. =) definitely coming back and bringing friends & family! ^_^"}
{"text":"I completely love this place! The owners are sweet and the food is delicious. I always order for pickup and the food is made fast. I would recommend this place for anyone who loves chinese food and wants a good fix!"}
{"text":"Food is great but they over charged my account  $410.06 and now I'm getting the run around from the owner about she has doctors appointment etc,etc, I should be priority since it wasn't my fault...."}
{"text":"Friendly staff   Decent lunch specials  The chow mein tasted a lil off than what I'm used to. Entree portions are decent.  Boba! Good serving of boba ..."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible . I ordered a simple sushi roll,California, and when i got it delivered it smelled and looked terrible,old and tasted stale . Everything else was good i dont believe they make fresh sushi or keep theor sea food fresh and when i called they didnt care to help me and the manager wouldnt get on the phone with me to talk about it . Terrible terrible service sadly . And i was a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Owners are really friendly pretty close to them, prices aren't so bad depending on what dishes you order they go by - half or full . Meals get you all filled up and there's a lot of options. Also their milk teas and no as are yummy !"}
{"text":"So I went here because I was having a craving for just plain ole California roll sushi and maybe a tempura roll.. I was very disappointed. I really wanted to like this place, it is small family owed and I love to support small businesses. My California roll was bland which I didn't even know was possible it's like the most easy to eat sushi ever because it has pretty much no taste, but this took it to another level. It was dry and just very disappointing. I also purchased their shrimp lover roll which is pictured on the menu under sushi and that was bland and not appetizing either. These 2 rolls cost a total of 15.05 and were a complete waste of money. One plus was that the rolls were a nice size about 8 large pieces but the fact that I only ate 2 pieces of each it didn't really matter much. So maybe it's my fault for ordering sushi from a Chinese food place but I give this place 2 stars and that's really pushing it."}
{"text":"Actually, the food is about a 3 or 3.5 but the people were very nice and portions were decent.  The option nearby are limited so this is the best around since I don't eat chain fast food very often."}
{"text":"Went here for valentines day family dinner. Surprisingly not busy!  Awesome food. We had the honey walnut shrimp, chicken fried rice, broccoli and mushroom saute, Mongolian beef, shrimp tempura roll, and shrimp lovers roll. Spent less than 80 bucks for 2 adults and 3 kids. Portions were awesome, alot for your money and then some. We had leftovers that lasted through midnight munchies and the next days lunch. Lol. I also ordered here previous for delivery via Eat24 website. We just live down the street so delivery was within 10 min after confirming the order was ready to be delivered. Waiting time for dining, considering we ordered about 5 dishes, about 20-30 min. I'll be coming here more ;) ."}
{"text":"Walked in and welcomed by a crying toddler. They have a room for him by the side.  I appreciate family businesses but perhaps they should build a door and turn up the muffled music.  As for the food, the reviewers weren't exaggerating. Very bland taste.  The mapo tofu was bland. The fish with black bean sauce had a weird taste. The breading overpowered the fish twofold.  All in all its not a bad lunch special which comes with egg roll and egg drop soup even for take out. Plus the service was nice but it took a little long for them to cook."}
{"text":"Sooo apprently it isnt Wok my World anymore. Let me just say, the new cook, or manager, or whoever is responsible for this new food, needs to crawl into a dark hole. This place used to be absolutely DELICIOUS. Loved getting food from there. Got food today, simple stuff, pork fried rice, chicken and broccoli, and so pot stickers. TERRIBLE. Absolutely TERRIBLE. Ill never eat at this establishment again. So disappointed."}
{"text":"I was craving Egg Foo Young...badly and have been for months.....so I decided to give this a try....I wish I hadn't.....It was unlike any other egg foo young I have ever had...it was actually \"chewy\" and just looked strange...like it was way overcooked......not exactly the way it's supposed to be....gravy was watery and contained things I have never seen before.....Suffice to say, I will NOT be going back...if the egg foo young was that bad, I don't want to know about the rest....I'll find somewhere else thank you very much....."}
{"text":"This place is not wok my world anymore...its been sold and is China passion...the service is good and the food is tasty but it is not the same recipes as before. Entirely different. a good place to eat but not the same one I loved for years. So sad they are gone."}
{"text":"I order shrimp fried rice and shrimp smell very bad. And can't believe the owner had her little kid there."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery, and just everything was so overrated. I advise everyone who orders through GrubHub to look at the yelp reviews before ordering. The mongolian beef tasted like old rubber, and the general's chicken tasted so old! I can't believe I even gave this place a shot. And their driver?! Came in freaking short shorts, a white tee, and flip flops? Seriously? Take your money somewhere else!!"}
{"text":"wrong order, chicken came with oranges, rice was so nasty and soggy. they sent wrong order i wanted chicken fried rice NOT steam rice"}
{"text":"Wok My World is pretty grubs if you're looking for a \"fast\" (I'll get to the quotations in a minute) chinese food pick up that's portioned just right (that's means I haven't left hungry) and yummy.  In addition to the food, what I liked most about this are the people.  They are super nice and willing to accommodate any way that they can.  One of my visits, a lady forgot to specify that her mom couldn't eat anything spicy and the dish that she ordered came spicy.  They were quick to re-make the order and send her on her way happy and satisfied.  Definitely awesome customer service.  Now to the food!  I ordered the fish with the black bean sauce and I wasn't let down.  My food came with lots of rice and some soup to boot (egg drop I believe it was?) and it quickly went down the hatch.  The only criticism that I have about 'Wok' is that it took awhile to get to my belly.  It looked like they were a bit understaffed and my wife and I had to wait awhile to get our orders.  I'm not the one to complain if my food takes a little while to make, but it seemed like they were working to the wire to get orders out by delivery and to us as well.  Other than that, we both enjoyed our meals and went home happy.  Four stars for my 'Wok'-ing friends at Wok My World.  Definitely willing to come back and hit up more of their menu."}
{"text":"As soon was i got in the waiter she greeted me and seem very nice. I asked  for a to go menu. I looked over the menu and everything seems good and cheap. I decided to get something off the lunch special. I wanted to try the L26 Fillet of fish w/Black bean sauce. The lunch special range from $5.75-$6.45 w/ soup of the day, egg roll, lo mein, fried rice or white rice.The place was clean and friendly.  After I ordered my food it took about 10 minutes for it to be finished. When I got home and about to eat my lunch I was disappointed that it was not what I ordered. It happened to be L21 Shrimp w/Snow peas. I ate it anyways. Wow, it was really good and flavorful. I've had this dish before and it was usually bland. The dish consist of shrimp, water chestnut, carrots, and snow peas. Every bite from the vegetable was crunchy so fresh. Shrimp was on point with the fried rice. I would come back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"They have really good chicken fried rice.  Never a fan, but thats all I really order from here because its so good.  Nice people.  Price for rice could be a buck less for the amount you get !"}
{"text":"First time ordering and completely satisfied... food was delivered 10 minutes earlier than expected AND the food is AMAZING... definitely will be my Chinese place of choice from now on. All the other Chinese places I've ordered from, we were very disappointed. We ordered the Broccoli and Beef, Sweet and Sour Pork, BBQ Pork Ribs, Chow Mein and Thai Tea / Milk Tea + got 5 free Potstickers. Everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"YAY!!! Finally found a place that has duck and delievers!!! Ordered delievery. Crispy duck, fried rice, and wontons.. Delivery was fast..duck was a little dry, but over all it was good and I will def order again!"}
{"text":"OMG! I know I usually only go to the same chinese restaurant all the time but me and the wifey went to try this place because its close. Needless to say that the food is AMAZING! I have eaten in almost every chinese food restaurant in town from expensive to a hole in the wall place and this is un my top 2 now. The only set back for me is they dont carry a salt amd pepper fried pork chop. But thats just a personal reason but the food is outstanding and the friendly owners are what makes this place worth comin to. Try it and you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"This place woks!  We visited Vegas from L.A. and after driving 5 hours really didn't want to brave the strip for dinner.  Sooo...we had it delivered via Grub Hub.  And, at an average of $8 per person, Wok My World was incredible!  The food was hot and flavorful, and better than almost all Chinese food I've had back in L.A.  Here's what we ordered: General Tao's Chicken - not too spicy, great flavor and just enough sauce.  Also came with a generous side of chicken fried rice that was delicious and not greasy at all!  Mushroom Beef- deeeelicious!  Lots of veggies but just as much beef!  Mongolian beef- a little spicy with a sweet side that compliments the beef perfectly!  Generous helpings of beef and veggies!  Combination lo mien- shrimp, beef, and chicken in a traditional lo mien sauce.  The noodles were perfectly cooked and everything was hot even after an hour of delivery time.  Appetizer combo- came with 2xfried shrimp, 2xwonton soups, 2xcheese wontons, and 2xspring rolls- everything was standard here.  The only thing I want to stress is that NONE of these items were even the least bit greasy!  I definitely recommend this combo for the money!"}
{"text":"This place is great!!! We been getting delivery for 3 years now, always fast, and polite . I get the Chinese Veggies in Brown Sauce and it so good. My husband gets the Curry Shrimp with extra shrimp. We love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"I just wrote a bad review about food express because the place sucked. So I thought I would at least write a good review about the place I should have went to. I love this place. I love there honey walnut shrimp. The lady is very nice to us everytime we go in there and I love the fact that it is a family ran business.  I have been there several times and the food is always delicious."}
{"text":"Food was delivered within 30-40 mins of ordering. Ordered family dinner A. Broccoli in the beef broccoli was crunchy, just the way I like it. Orange chicken was flavorful. Lo mein was salty. Fortune cookies, stale. Minus 2 stars since rice is additional $ and delivery fee is high compared to near by competitors."}
{"text":"I'm going to get picky here. I hope they don't hate me.  I had friends in town for the weekend.  We were trying to figure out a place to have dinner, and we decided on this place.  It's a small place but with friendly service.  Like I said, I got a little picky and they were great about it.  I eat low carb during the week and they were able to make me some chicken without the sauce.  Of course my friends hassled me a bit, but what are friends for.  I give this place 4 stars and will probably be back to have a real meal."}
{"text":"Very good food, surprisingly.  The service was great, food was prepared very well.  This place is the best of all the little local places.  We definately will be back.  They need more customers, so give it a try."}
{"text":"Loved it!!! We got the pu pu platter and the 4 star Kung pao plate. This was more than enough for the 2 of us. The cream cheese wontons were great wish I'd ordered more. Ribs were so good!!! The Kung pao plate omg. So flavorful and just the right portioning of chicken shrimp and beef. To top it all off they deliver!!! Delivery was pretty fast and guy was friendly. Great little place I'll be ordering again for sure. Wish I'd taken a picture."}
{"text":"It defiantly doesn't look like much from the outside, and once you walk in its a decent size space but it's usually pretty empty. The set up is ok. The owners wife is the cashier and she has her son with her. He's a boys boy, and defiantly likes to play. I had my two year old daughter with me, and I'm sure people don't like being bothered by kids they don't know. I could tell by how the mother kept nervously telling her son to be nice and to leave my daughter alone. I thought it was cute, she's only two and the little boy is four. I enjoyed him keeping my daughter busy while we were waiting for the food. The food came out pretty quick and tasted good! The prices are great too. I will probably go back. :) defiantly a child friendly restaurant, which can be hard to come by on the eastside."}
{"text":"Had delivery since we got the flyer in the mail and decided to try it. The food wasn't too bad although some of it can be done better but the delivery was sorta fast I suppose.. I really don't understand how the driver would not have any change at all though. But never the less their portions are good"}
