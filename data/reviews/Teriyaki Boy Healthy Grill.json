{"text":"the best healthy chicken and rice combo I've experienced. Its the perfect combo, workout and then after get your grub on. No need to cook."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, have been delivering on a weekly basis. Compared to other restaurants where delivery issues occur on a consistent basis, teriyaki boy acts as a friendly reminder that professionalism still exists"}
{"text":"My experience was awesome, got lots of tasty food for a great price.  Have had both the chicken and steak bowl.  Service is always friendly and quick when I go.  I like the containers they use, easy to reheat cause the portions are so big."}
{"text":"Came here at dinner time .I ordered steak , they don't have it . I ordered noodles , they don't have it . I ordered taro boba , they also don't have it . I ordered shrimp , they don't have it . Soooo what do you guys have ? Theres a whole menu with nothing. . Please re up your inventory . Bad 1st impression ."}
{"text":"Great veggies and chicken. Close to the athletic club. Great for a,quickie meal. Fast friendly service ."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their chicken and beef are delicious. I love how quick it is and that they have healthy options. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with a sense of proud ownership had the pleasure of meeting the owner the service provide was excellent.  The food is great I come here after every work for a good health meal. I truly recommend trying this teriyaki boy."}
{"text":"There's a 20 min wait for my chicken and when I get home I open my bag up and there's no teriyaki sauce on either of my bowls at all. I asked for double meat on both and there was no more than 4 oz of chicken in each bowl. I call to let them know and the manager said she could give me $5 off my next order. Oh that's cool you'll refund 1/4 of what I paid. Seriously? This place is a sorry excuse for a restaurant, take your money elsewhere. Thanks for a flavorless dry ass chicken \"teriyaki\" bowl assholes."}
{"text":"So the boss apparently changed the policy  And now after ordering the cutler bowl You will find that 70% of the meat is all fat  Thanks for no thanks , last time you'll see the money of this regular .  Thank you for your years of business I'll spend my money where they actually give meat without the fat.  Cheers"}
{"text":"Walk in and was given a friendly greeting. Store is clean. Used the restroom, you need a key so it is also clean. Food arrived quickly and the quality was fresh and yummy. It's fast food but still healthy!"}
{"text":"I ate there at lunch and as soon as I get back to work myself and a co worker were sitting on the toilet. We not going back"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for lunch. they have a chicken teriyaki bowl special for $4.  there's a lot of other things on the menu too including wraps and salads and potstickers.  once I purchased a few beef and chicken bowls for lunch for the week.  filling and healthy choices.   nice and friendly customer service.  overall a good place to stop by if you like teriyaki"}
{"text":"Amazing Restaurant with the best staff! Absolutely love the Yaki Soba bowl, Firecracker bowl, and the egg rolls are on point. Always fresh and tastes great. Protein shakes, smoothies and Boba is killer, as well. Awesome that it's right next to the best Nutrition store around, Nutrition Rush. Can pick up my supplements at unbeatable prices and finish up with an incredible, healthy meal. Boom, done. Don't go anywere else when you want Teriyaki awesomeness. :)"}
{"text":"I really don't understand the negative reviews I am seeing. I suppose things can happen. But, I've had nothing but good experiences in the few times I have been here. I usually get the Mongolian Beef bowl. The meat is cooked very well. Its tender, and there is a nice amount of garlic. If you are trying to eat healthy, then this is a good place to try. Plus, for a mom & pop business, they have done a great job branding. I like the logo and the place is decorated very well."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of teriyaki chicken and this place didn't disappoint! Really good healthy options. Mr Olympia eats here so how could you go wrong?"}
{"text":"The best chicken bowls! Karen was so awesome and kind! Try their boba and protein shakes!"}
{"text":"Great service and the food is excellent! Awesome prices too!!  I'll definitely be a regular here after trying it for my first time!"}
{"text":"This place is always a good choice , quick and healthy food that taste delicious! Check out the daily special !"}
{"text":"The location is great. Right next to LVAC and the tanning salon. I am a fan of Jay Cutler so when he recommended this place I decided to go check it out right away. The food is good; not exceptional but good.  I was disappointed by the customer service. I will pay extra if the customer service is good. The men at the location were courteous and polite, the woman however, was rude and seemed to be very unhappy working there. 'While looking for a table, the tables were dirty and  I had to clean a table to sit there. It was a disappointing experience. I guess I expected so much more since Jay Cutler was the one to recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Good food and service is friendly. The location is very convenient to stop in after visitng LVAC."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for a meal after a workout! Quick. Clean. And most importantly,  delicious!"}
{"text":"There is nothing fast about this place. Crap service. Waited 5 min to even noticed when I walked in. No apologies NOTHING. Then she forgot about my order and I waited for 25 minutes. Should of walked out when I waited 5 min.  Update. 1/15/15 the people here are rude. But the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"I thought the concept of this place was good, although basically the same thing as the Flame Broiler restaurants.   The problems began when we started ordering at the counter and the cashier wasn't very friendly at all. Not only was she grumpy and seemingly scowling, but she wasn't very helpful.   My wife ordered the Mahi Wrap, but we were quickly informed they were out of Mahi, so we switched the order to a salmon wrap. I ordered the chicken noodle bowl. We ordered a kids chicken bowl with noodles for our daughters to share. We asked if they could have some vegetables with the kids bowl and she said no because it doesn't come with vegetables. She did not seem interested in offering any other solutions for this inquiry.  We waited about 10 minutes and the food came out. My wife was served a salmon rice bowl instead of the wrap. The cashier was so unfriendly-seeming that we opted to not say anything about the incorrect order.  The food was pretty ordinary. I did not feel this there was anything special about the food. Perhaps the cloud of the unhappy employee clouded our taste buds. Needless to say, we will not be returning to this restaurant and if we having a craving for this type of food, we'll simply go to one of the other similar restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Yo yo yo yo yo yo this place has mad healthy chicken bowls. What else? Healthy beef? But yo you don't eat that meaty meat meatness? Then just eat dem healthy ass veggies. All day. Errday."}
{"text":"I come here often and most of the time they mess up my order. Workers don't speak English and food is often under cooked or raw. Several times I've ordered a large bowl and they charge me for large but give me a small bowl. Overall a very bad experience."}
{"text":"Very affordable and delicious. From the salad to the chicken bowl. The veggies are fresh and perfect not mushy at all."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed that they didn't honor my Epoxy purchases.  I was owed a free 13th bowl and when I presented them the app they said they no longer accepted it.  If you're going to start a loyalty program you should keep your word."}
{"text":"Amazing service and awesome food!!! I love the Jay Cutler bowl! You can not go wrong with this place. Very healthy as well and great for macro managing!"}
{"text":"This place has the best beef ever! Very good and lean. Excellent customer service and clean environment. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Top notch customer service and excellent food that makes you want to just keep ordering more and more and more because it is so good! I really enjoyed my first time their and I keep coming back with my friends all the time when I am in the area! I would definitely recommend to any people out their!"}
{"text":"not a happy camper. Not at all. I had been looking forward to this all day! I pull up to the drive through, knew what I wanted so I ordered right away. I get to the window. There were at least 3 employees in there. Took them a good 3 minutes to acknowledge me. I paid and they gave me my drink in which he had to ask again what kind I wanted. this is where it gets good. Minutes starting going by. Neither one of the three employees would look my way, and one of them eating up by the register, and I could see there was nobody coming into the dining area as they were just talking away. A total of 10 minutes pass by when finally I see them putting my food in my bag and coming to the window. The same girl that was eating hands me my bag without an apology about the time or even a have a great night, not a single word was said.  I get home to eat my food to find burnt chicken, burnt noodles and a burnt egg roll. And I'm not talking just a little crispy, like you could taste the burnt with every bite, the few I had. You would think with the amount of time it took for me to get my food I would at least get something edible. All I wanted was a good teriyaki bowl and what I got was a disappointment."}
{"text":"By far the best teriyaki bowl I've ever had. I got the steak yakisoba bowl. Usually chow mien noodles are very oily at most restaurants, but not here. I love the fact that they use whole wheat noodles. The large was just the right amount and there was enough steak to last until the end.  I'm home now wishing they were still open so I could get another one! The staff was very friendly and helpful. If you're looking for a great, healthy meal this place is definitely worth a try. The prices were very reasonable and the food was absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Love til his place.healthy and tastes amazing. I recommend the steak and chicken bowl"}
{"text":"This dish was made fresh and is at a very great price point!   I have attached a picture to show the quality of the meal that was prepared."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great flavor and a healthy choice. The cashier was helpful with suggesting something light and quick to munch on"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Quick and easy. Friendly staff. Right by the gym so easy access. Great way to eat healthy if you're on the go!"}
{"text":"Food is decent. But service is extremely slow. Staff is either incompetent or they just don't care. Either is a failing recipe in the service industry."}
{"text":"The best teriyaki ive ever tasted!! I absolutely love. I had the chicken bowl with all the veggies and god! Its so delicious!"}
{"text":"One of the best healthy restaurants to eat at,  also the staff is extraordinarily friendly and deserve a large amount of praise!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and did not disappoint! The place was also tidy and had great customer service."}
{"text":"The food is great but I have problems every time I go to this location.  Service is very poor. I will not be going to this location any longer I leave upset every time. . ."}
{"text":"Had lunch here the other day. I wouldn't have even known it existed if it wasn't in the parking lot of my gym so convenience was key in my decision.    It is a great place if you are looking for a no thrills healthy lunch. I had a veggie noodle bowl and my husband had a chicken wrap. They up-charge for all white chicken and to sub brown rice on the wrap. We left feeling guilt free and full."}
{"text":"Awesome portions, great flavor served by friendly staff. We even grabbed a kids size bowl for dog .. she's a fan too. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Delishhhh ! Chicken & Steak Bowl - super healthy and it's delicious ! So much better than madness !"}
{"text":"This place is the best! The Jay Cutler Bowl is all anyone needs to feel like a champ! This place is a must eat!"}
{"text":"So I've gave this place three tries, 3 strikes and youre out. This one is not even close to fresh and hot as the Eastern and 215 one. I like the food, I really really do. This location gave me cold food, again. If I didnt get a great experience time and time again at the other location, then one star. I just don't understand how this one is so much worse."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 4 to 5 stars until just now. LOVE their Yakasoba bowls BUT I just called to place an order. Asked for no rice and if I can have veggies instead. After telling me it was going to be 9.something I asked what the base price was. She responded with $7 and change (cant remember the exact amount). She said they were charging me for extra veggies. I let her know that I asked if I could sub Veggies for Rice, but if I was going to be charged extra then I would only do veggies, no rice, no extra veggies. She said that that's how she was trained to charged this type of order and it wouldn't be worth it to just do chicken and veggies. That's when I told her Id order somewhere else. I'm not a big fan of Teriyaki Madness buuuuuut, I'm calling them now. They've always catered to whatever we've ordered. Don't get me wrong, the food is good but with this service...no thanks. P.S. This is the Warm Springs and Rainbow location."}
{"text":"Mongolian Beef & Chicken Bowl is the best!!!  So much flavor   Get the noodles with it too... worth it"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I love the daily special because the price is awesome but so is the flavor!"}
{"text":"First thing first- THEY DONT USE GLOVES TO MAKE YOUR FOOD!!!!! My first time there, while waiting in line to order, I looked into their \"kitchen\" and saw that neither of the 3 workers were wearing gloves. When it came to be my turn to order, I actually had to ask them to put on gloves before they make my food. Did they listen? Of course not. I watched them make everyone else's food in the restaurant- including mine- without gloves. So when my food was up, I asked for my money back instead. They were touching their clothes, faces, and kitchen instruments and then touching your food- with bare hands. The cashier was also touching money and then YOUR FOOD. Will never return."}
{"text":"Friend and I tried Vegetable bawl and teriyaki bawl. it took 10minutes to get those. veggies undercooked."}
{"text":"I love teriyaki boy, i'm all for healthy food, good portions sizes, greens and bobba teas. But for some reason the meat and chicken sometimes taste undercooked :/ and I was so excited about them opening a location next to us."}
{"text":"If you are going to this place for the vegetarian food then just note that they use the same grill that they use for meat to cook your food. Also I think they should get better employees (no care at all for customers)."}
{"text":"The beef in my beef teriyaki was reheated. The rice was soggy. The sauce was okay I guess, if you can get past the day old meat. The Gyoza where of the microwave variety and were not good. I have to say this is the worst \"teriyaki\" I have ever had.  I barely ate any of the meal and returned it to the counter to explain my dissatisfaction. The cook and the counter girl just gave me a blank stare. Too bad for the owner he has such crap employee's.   With all of the teriyaki places out there, why would you ever eat here?"}
{"text":"I purchased a groupon and visited the Teriyaki Boy restaurant on 10/17/12.    My first impression was the food smelled good and the restaurant was clean.  The person taking my order, adult female, was very short with me and less then helpful.    I ordered a chicken bowl with brown rice and vegetables.  The brown rice and vegetables were good, the chicken however was over cooked to the point that it was difficult to chew.    I felt like I was eating beef jerky without the flavor.  I will not return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Very delicious food. I got the chicken teriyaki bowl and it's soo good. I have no complaints the place is very clean, the employees are very nice and it is not expensive at all. Will Forsure be coming back! Best teriyaki food I've tried so far!"}
{"text":"SEVERE FOOD POISONING!!! I ate in this restaurant on 10/13/17 at 8:15 pm. I ordered the Chicken Yaki Soba Bowl, with dark meat. It tasted good and looked good good too. I drove home, and by 11 PM I was drifting into a weird state of mind; confusion, blurry vision, tingling in arms, head feeling hot, and a ringing in my ears. I tried to stand and almost fell over, being too dizzy to walk. I felt like I was drugged and couldn't control it. I started vomiting which went on for 2 hours and tossed up everything I had eaten at this restaurant. It was so bad, I thought I was going to die! I'm not exaggerating. It was so bad I didn't think I was going to make it! The only reason I did not call an ambulance, is because my wife was nearby and she recognize the same symptoms that she experienced, from food poisoning she got from a different restaurant.  I have never experienced a level of food poisoning to this degree as I did this night. After a few hours I woke up and the symptoms subsided, and I was fine.   The cook was handling a lot of chicken and I could see him behind the counter cutting and cooking at a fast pace. He was preparing several different orders at once, and nothing looked unusual from my view. The girl however, who took my order and handled the money, had chew bitten dirty fingernails, dirty hands, and she didn't look to clean either. I was turned off from that and hoped she wasn't touching the food.   I filed a formal complaint with the SNHD and I hope they investigate the food handling practices within this establishment. I will NEVER set foot in here again, and I hope no one else gets sick from eating here! I don't know if I got sick from the chicken, the teriyaki sauce, or from something else in the meal (noodles, vegetables, etc) but it definitely was from this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to eat. everybody here is very nice and helpful, Food is lit AF! Very good. Mongolian beef is my favorite plate. Texture is good. Always smells good. One time I ordered and went to the slots and won $300 bucks. This is my go to after a good time with the boys."}
{"text":"Easiest and healthiest way to eat!!! Best bowls in town! My favorite is the chicken teriyaki bowl and everything is done fresh."}
{"text":"They made me wait nearly 30 minutes, messed up my order, didn't fix the problem, and simply gave me a refund. Maybe I shouldn't have pointed out to the cashier that she sneezed in her hands and then handled (other people's) food without gloves. Nasty"}
{"text":"I ordered the Sweet and Sour Chicken bowl and the rice was under cooked and had no taste at all as well as the chicken.  Eating healthy doesn't mean it has to be tasteless. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"came here while i was in LV on a business trip, good food, large portions, clean seating, and good parking"}
{"text":"If you're in need to eat healthy but don't want to take the time out of your day to cook this is the perfect spot to go to. The service is Fast and the food is great. Favorite dish here is the regular size Teriyaki grilled chicken steamed vegetables and light brown rice. The part I like the most is that you see the people in the back grilling your chicken so it takes the effect of it being \"fast food\". I have 3 children three different age groups and they all enjoyed having dinner here.  You can tell the staff gets along great with each other which is very nice to see however I don't think it's appropriate when they're saying certain curse words and they have customers in the restaurant... for that reason alone I give it a four-star"}
{"text":"First time hir love the food the service was great I got the Yakima soba bowls with shrimp was delicious and the daily specials for 3.99 wow great deal will be come back for sure"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a co-worker. We got the chicken teriyaki bowl and the salmon teriyaki bowl. Both bowls were more than half filled with water. Ordered extra veggies: one bowl only had zucchini while the other bowl only had cabbage and carrots. Both bowls only had 5 full bites of meat. Definitely underwhelming and not worth what I paid for.  I would not recommend this place to anyone. Do not let the 'healthy' part of the name trick you... you can get filling and fresh food somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is a great healthy alternative and right next to the LVAC it's perfect for me!"}
{"text":"I wish I had no taste buds like those people that left a 5 star review. I'm better with sharing my dog food"}
{"text":"If you like spicy beef then u MUST try the Korean BBQ  here! I tried all locations but this one is best one for sure fresh , tasty and affordable  love it !"}
{"text":"Came in after the gym to grab some quick food. Big mistake! Waited about 15 min to order, only 2 people ahead of me but the counter girl was constantly taking orders on the phone and serving delivery drivers. After ordering, another 30 min passed until my food was finally ready. Also, they were out of brown rice and light chicken (mind boggling considering it was dinner time and these are probably the 2 most ordered items). I don't blame the workers as it seems they were trying their best. Clearly poor management, poor training. Management appeared non-existent, which explains a lot. Bottom line, don't go here after the gym if you're hungry."}
{"text":"Yikes! First and LAST time ever coming here. We decided to try this place out because just came from a doctors appointment and wanted to eat something quick. Service was great but the food was horrible! It's advertised as a \"healthy grill\", but our food was not! I ordered the Korean BBQ  steak which was tough and chewy.  It was just drenched in a Korean BBQ sauce. My fiance had the shrimp bowl and it was just cooked shrimp with some Asian sauce poured over it. The only thing I liked was the option to have brown rice.   Needless to say at $20 for 2 people  and the food isn't that great I will never come back again."}
{"text":"Not very good at all. Went there with a friend, waited about 15 minutes for our food. It was cooked in front of us, but when we picked it up it was cold! Not to mention some tables are directly across from the rest room. A little off putting. My friend got a chicken egg roll that had a weird smell to it. She didn't risk it and threw it away. It was soggy too.  I would rather go to teriyaki madness."}
{"text":"Clean place, food is yummy-chicken yakisoba and friendly staff especially Jennifer !!!"}
{"text":"Really clean establishment and good food. Delicious Boba smoothies staff is very nice also I would definitely recommend this place for a quick bite to eat at lunch or to stop in after you go to the gym or something super healthy options."}
{"text":"Teriyaki Box is great. The rice beans are very good. I get the daily special. It's a good deal for my budget. I work as a towel roller at the venetian, so I have very little time for cooking when I'm not rolling towels."}
{"text":"We Love this place! We as in my kids the teriyaki chicken bowl is great! Its on a daily special price. Their Teriyaki sauce is so freaking bomb I wish they sold it by the bottle I would use it daily cooking it tastes amazing! We go quite a few times a month thats how great this place is and they even sell Protein shakes and Boba drinks. There is so much to list with food options this place is really fantastic especially if you are looking to eat healthy."}
{"text":"I decided to give Teriyaki Bowl a try. I was pleasantly surprised. The food is delicious! The vegetables are fresh. I have recommended this place to friends and family. If you think Panda Express is good, you're gonna rave about Teriyaki Boy!  It appears they cook meals when you order them, so there's a short wait. But believe me it is worth the extra minutes! Give them a try. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Good spot to get teriyaki chicken. The staff is awesome and really on top of thier customer service."}
{"text":"It is cheap, tasty and healthy... that is pretty much the long and the short of it. I always swing in here when I'm in town, especially after a workout."}
{"text":"I appreciate this place for what it is: simple, healthy food. The meat is always delicious and never greasy. The rice and veggies are a little plain but are complemented with a little teriyaki sauce on top. If you need a meal to energize you for a workout or just to help you not fall asleep at your work desk, this be the place to go. And the service has always been friendly."}
{"text":"Ordered on grubhub a very simple order, two terriyaki bowls.  Get a notification the order is received by restaurant and i am given est time.  Then 20 min later i get a new est time and its a little later. Then 20 min after the already delayed time i message grubhub and they try to contact the resteraunt with no success. Finally after 45 past the est time i had grubhub cancel and refund. Only problem is now its to late to order anywhere else. What a joke of a business"}
{"text":"This place is the best healthy grill ! Thumbs up.  I ordered the Korean Steak BBQ . Delicious"}
{"text":"My usual stop after a good workout for a refuel. Disappointed they don't honor the LVAC discount like the southwest location.  Dined in, tables and floor were rather dirty. Definitely not up to par with the southwest location. Hope the food doesn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"They're poke is great, but need to change they're hours of operation. Restaurant says it closes at 10:30pm but the doors were locked when I wanted to grab something to bite late at night."}
{"text":"Getting healthy lunch w mom! Was a tasty choice I requested veggies opposed to rice and they set me up for a healthy meal!! Def coming back!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat very good teriyaki chicken I recommend everything on this place are delicious the smoothies are very good too"}
{"text":"Same cashier, same experience. I was offered a free meal from their awesome Yelp team, which I told them I would use today. Well the cashier didn't know what I was talking about and gave me $6.99 off (my meal was more then that). I brought my dog so I was going to sit outside, the chairs were still chained so you could sit on them but not comfortably use the table. This is a nice neighborhood I don't see why they need to be chained during business hours. Seems excessive. Never seen anyone sit on them and now I know why. I got it to go and won't be back.  I did appreciate their Yelp teams awesome customer service but that has to transfer over into service in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Teriyaki boy is the place to go for healthy Rice bowls and boba in the southwest area, everything is made fresh and full of protein. You will not be disappointed when you come here!"}
{"text":"great healthy food spot! great variety of asian food! I always get the salmon yaki soba bowl! best spot to eat after the gym!"}
{"text":"If i could i would give this a zero star .. their customer service is the worst ive ever had . They are never in drive thru and when they are they take 25+ mins on an order !!! this is unacceptable"}
{"text":"I never do reviews. I took a bite of their teriyaki chicken bowl  and I thought to myself why does this taste so good. Keep up the good work in the Kitchen!"}
{"text":"This place is going down hill!! Who is the owner? What kind of people are you hiring? I came inside and no one was at the counter.. after 4 minutes some young kid comes out, looks super high! I even told him that his chicken that was on the grill was burning and he just stared at me!! Like bro are you not understanding what I'm saying? Then he proceeded to take my order and I asked his if he was high as fuck! He giggled and said yea, Smh this is why businesses go under. I sure hope the owner is reading this."}
{"text":"This restaurant is A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. I've never been here   and I was disappointed. Every time is fabulous. Great food and service!! Good bank for your buck!"}
{"text":"This location doesn't even deserve a star. They are supposed to be opened at 11am and it is now 11:15an and they won't open the doors. Talk about horrible service. I went to open the door and was told by the lady inside that they weren't opened yet. She was rude and unprofessional. Never coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Healthy quick and a reasonable price makes it the place to come especially if your looking for something after a great work out"}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant to try this place because of it's rating, but I went ahead and ordered a few bowls online.  Needless to say, it's not bad.  I wasn't blown away, but for a \"teriyaki bowl\" restaurant, there's not much you can do to it to make me do back flips. The teriyaki sauce is decent, not too salty and had a good consistency.  Add some Sriracha and you'll be a happy camper.  Pros: I love the online ordering.  Though it was not ready when I got there, at least it was cooked fresh, the meat was tender, and the bowl was loaded.  I did not eat there, but the place is clean and the staff is friendly. Cons: Just that I had to wait for my order when I placed it in advance.  Not a deal breaker. Suggestion: Order extra chicken if you like your protein.  They give you a good size portion, but I eat more protein & veggies then I do rice, so I definitely needed a little more to make my belly happy."}
{"text":"I was a little apprehensive cause it was healthy terriyaki and even though most teriyaki is usually made with rice but because I'm on a low carb diet and can't have any rice. It was made with all vegetables and it was rather large and really good."}
{"text":"Food is great but they honestly have the worst service and are so unorganized! It's 11:20am and I order a Chicken Teriyaki Bowl with brown rice and a Thai Tea Boba and five minutes later one of the cooks is telling the cashier to ask if we want to wait because the brown rice isn't ready. Then another 5 minutes later I get my order and ask about the boba and was asked if I can wait another 5 minutes because the gel is cooking. Seriously?! Get your shit together! Never coming here again! I'll just stick to the one near my house on Eastern and 215!"}
{"text":"Love this place from the yaki soba to the chicken teriyaki, my favorite is the pokey bowl over brown rice with veggies. Always fresh and whenever I call in it's always ready on time   I will continue to come here as long as they're open"}
{"text":"My kids love coming here after i go workout and now they even  assume that every time that we come to the gym we should stop and get a salmon teriyaki bowl."}
{"text":"Only been once, but I liked what I had!  The Kung Pao Chicken Bowl was very tasty, with just the right amount of spice. It was a very good portion, and I actually had leftovers to take home for dinner. For under $10 (including a drink) that is a very good deal.   Very much a fast-food vibe, but clean and friendly.  The staff brought our orders to the table.  Looking forward to trying more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Best healthy Asian food I found in Vegas! CONSISTENTLY GOOD! Food taste fresh and great!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a cold bubble tea on a hot 102 day degrees in Vegas... this drink was needed. I asked the cashier which one he liked the best and he said the one I was thinking of ordering.... mango. It was sweet, icy and certainly had a delicious mango flavor. Will be back to try some of the other flavors."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very clean, that's very important for me when I dine out. I ordered Chicken and Steak Teriyaki with with rice, their steak is a little chewy. Their teriyaki sauce is a little too sweet."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed!! I bought a large yakisoba bowl half steak, half chicken and 2 large teriyaki bowls half chicken and half steak. When I got home to eat I come to find out there was only 3 strips of chicken and 3 strips of steak so practically I got a bowl of rice and a bowl of noodles! This place USED to be up to par with their portions now I'm not sure if I'll ever go back very disappointed customer!"}
{"text":"Great location near my work and its a healthy alternative to burgers or fried food. Place opened today and its spotless clean. They honored their Epoxy coupon if 50% one item. They also have boba! Adding this as a week day lunch spot"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to grab food when I'm in the mood for Teriyaki  Always grabbing the teriyaki bowl and brown rice. Great staff there and delicious teriyaki sauce.  The mixed veggies are great as well. Be careful if you throw too much sauce on there or it could be a bit on the unhealthy side.  The establishment is really clean as well, so you don't worry about how safe your food is to eat."}
{"text":"This place is way too small. The bathrooms say they are closed for \"cleaning\" and smell terrible because the tables are way too close to the bathrooms. The chicken isn't completely cooked. The noise level from the machines, the radio blaring, and cook banging around in back is ridiculous. I thought this place was going to be better. All of these meals I can make at home for about $3.00"}
{"text":"My first visit was pretty awesome, this was a few weeks ago we ate in the place is was amazing. That is what encourage us to go back for our second trip. We got Mongolian beef and teriyaki chicken bowl. That was very good. Which is why I gave it 2 stars, this time we got take out and we were very disappointed! I got home to find 5 pieces of steak in my steak and broccoli bowl. The meat was very hard to chew. From someone who just came from the gym I was looking to have a very nice portion of meat.    My hubby got Korean steak bbq tonight and he said it was good.   I just hope that they can be consistent with the food. I shouldn't have to check to see if there is enough in there."}
{"text":"Teriyaki boy! The service here was very good. My food came out hot,fresh and fast! Definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a yummy & healthy place to grab some lunch!!!"}
{"text":"I've given this place three visits now before writing a review. The food is alright, the chicken is a little on the dry side but the other items seem to be just fine. The only issue I have is with the portions. I ordered the low carb chicken bowl and it only had a small amount of chicken for the $8.65 I paid. It was good, but for that price I'd rather go to teriyaki brother down the road, they have much better portions for your dollar."}
{"text":"This is one of the best teriyaki bowls I have ever had and the bowls come with a large order of vegetables so it is very healthy. On top of the great food they have good customer service and they get you your food quickly"}
{"text":"I went today with my mate Patrick. Great food, great service and amazing value. Teriyaki chicken bowl is only $3.99 and filled me up! I'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"Very fresh food. Taste great. We had the chicken bowl. Veggies were prepared perfect. Nice size portion. Clean inside and inviting. Will be be a regular."}
{"text":"Great place to have some good teriyaki favorites! Portions are not bad, but quality is great! I come everytime after I workout to get my protein!"}
{"text":"Great portions, and rad staff! Food does not take long to prepare.  Relatively inexpensive, and there's flavor for any liking."}
{"text":"I love this place and it's food.. but the staff at this location need to get it together.. I go maybe 2 times a week in the afternoon (super close to my house) and the staff is always super loud and on their phones, laughing like they are crazy. while the dinning area is disgusting, I even had to wipe my own table and eating area.. there's this chubby hispanic girl that works cashier in the evenings that's sooooo rude and treats u like as if ur not a paying customer..  smh  bet they have roches in the back..."}
{"text":"Bomb Teriyaki! I come here all the time and I'm never disappointed plus the customer service blows other teriyaki out of the water!"}
{"text":"Best clean food in the neighborhood. The service is always stellar and the place is kept clean. I generally eat there twice a week. The Jay Cutler bowl is really my lunch and dinner. It's 2 delicious servings in one bowl. Thanks for the great food."}
{"text":"I order them often for lunch through eat24, the food is always freshly made. I love when a place greets you when you enter and leave. Their restaurant is always clean and so are their bathrooms which is very important to me. The food is always on time when I order it, and they have yet to make a mistake on my order. I like that they check on you half way through your meal and ask now everything was, this places cares about their food and their customers."}
{"text":"It's like Samurai Sam's, but better. The meats are above average quality. They have a great selection. The people are really nice and remember you. Lots of selection... Wraps, salads, bowls, etc."}
{"text":"Came in for a late night munch with my fiance, called in our order when we were about 3 minutes away, by the time we walked in and paid, our food was done. Food is incredible, better yet the customer service was amazing! Richard did a great job of earning my return! Thanks for the good food guys! We ordered 2 massive chicken teriyaki bowls and it was under under $15. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Good for a quick yum yums. The yakisoba was fine, veggies were cooked perfectly and I like how they was a lot of meat (they don't skimp on the protein). It is also close to LVAC so it is convenient."}
{"text":"I love Teriyaki Boy! The staff is always friendly and quick. The food is delicious! I come here all the time!"}
{"text":"It's our first time at Terriyaki Boy and it did not disappoint. We did not wait long for our food and service was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch. This place is located next to Albertson's in a small shopping center.   Hubby saw the special which was $3.99 for the teriyaki bowl, drink not included. We got three orders of the teriyaki bowl, one drink and one mango boba. I didn't know they sold boba drinks. The mango slush with boba was good. Boba tasted sweet. My daughter even liked it even though she normally doesn't.   After the lady took our order, we took a seat at a table. Place was small and had air conditioning inside. You check in on Yelp and get six pieces of potstickers for free. I forgot to claim it but hubby did. Yum! Teriyaki bowl was good. It had pieces of chicken, sliced up carrots, cabbage, and broccoli. They didn't drench too much sauce which is how I like it. Rice was perfectly cooked. Perfect meal. The mango boba was good. I could taste pieces of fresh mango in my slush. I loved the taste of mango.   As we ate our food, we hear music in the background. Definitely a great mix of music. They were playing \"How you remind me\" by Nickelback. I found myself singing along. LOL! Hope no one heard me. It was a mix of old and new school. I liked the vibe in here.   This place was pretty good! Highly recommend if you are on this side of town. Parking spaces are up front."}
{"text":"First time here i had the steam rice with spicy chicken with vegetables. A healthy choice that's also delicious didn't make me super full but content. I will try something different next time."}
{"text":"They Hit the spot! hands down best place in town! It's healthy and delicious! Great service! Fast and friendly! Prices are the best! And the place is very clean! Will be visiting again."}
{"text":"I normally don't complain or write reviews, but I waited 25 minutes for a large chicken bowl and a regular chicken bowl. When I received my chicken bowl 25 minutes later I received rice, 1 carrot, 1 broccoli cut in half a whole lot of cabbage and my chicken. I come here all the time and have never waited that long especially for a chicken bowl. My issue is why did it take so long for my bowl? It wasn't a big order and on top of that I get a bowl full of cabbage."}
{"text":"Amazing staff and great food. I love coming here to eat. The food is priced good and the place is always clean when I come here. Also the food comes out in a timely manner every time I come here."}
{"text":"Delicious healthy food with lots of choices and great for after a workout. Large portions for the price and good ratio of protein to veggies and noodles. Nice people and fast service, great for take out."}
{"text":"Place is not too busy, food is delicious, highly recommend going here if you want to enjoy a more healthy meal, and it can fill you up. Jay cutler bowl is super huge"}
{"text":"Love my teriyaki bowls! Especially the Jay Cutler bowl! Make sure to stop in if you're behind on your prep to grab a quickie before work!"}
{"text":"Great and friendly service! Came in right as they opened and was welcomed warmly. They were excited to see people come get some fresh food!"}
{"text":"Great employee working during my visit. Very informative and helpful. She was very helpful as it was my first time visiting the place. She suggested the teriyaki chicken and I must say it was delicious. I may just become a regular now! :)"}
{"text":"Super food in Vegas after training and they are always soo helpful! Five stars forever! Best regards Sweden"}
{"text":"I love their healthy foods and they great costumer service, plus it's really close to lvac so after I work out I just eat there"}
{"text":"Really good food. I love the everyday special bowl. Awesome Chicken teriyaki and rice. Good prices. Great customer service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Always come here food is always fresh and yummy! Always good service fast and friendly:)"}
{"text":"The food is good and you can have a delicious healthy meal at a very low price.  Less than 10$.  I like how they have pictures of the food as well."}
{"text":"Trying this place out, let's see if it is better then teriyaki madness. I do like the fact they are all about fitness & nutrition. Unlike a lot of other place around town. Trying out one of the protein shakes as well."}
{"text":"This place was good,  they open earlier then the rest, I was craving teriyaki bowls and this hit the spot"}
{"text":"Trying this place out for the first time it all looks good and good customer service, it's right up the street from my house so ill def be back"}
{"text":"I was expecting a Samurai Sams clone, but nope, this is way better imo.  Great portions, meats not dry, veggies not soggy.  Could be my favorite lunch spot soon."}
{"text":"Love this place great service, great food. Always come here for their daily special so filling and good!"}
{"text":"They cashier was very welcoming, this being my first time here I wasn't sure what to order, he was patient and helped me by describing the bowls. I also was able to get a loyalty card"}
{"text":"So I walked and felt welcome . I ordered the chicken and steak teriyaki bowl . And I have to say it was delicious . Loved the fresh veggies used in it . I would highly recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant in Las Vegas! Food is so healthy and so delicious and quick! I am a vegetarian so it is so perfect for me! My boyfriend loves their chicken teriyaki and their beef bowls! I also love their Boba Tea!! So awesome!! I eat here every time after working out at LVAC since it is so healthy and so yummy!"}
{"text":"Poor service and attitude after we received our order and both bowls were wrong. Called the store right after we got our order delivered and they do not take responsibility for mistakes. Do not order here, if your food is wrong you are stuck with no dinner for the night. Just like we are now...What business in today's world acts like that?"}
{"text":"First time customer at this place, after having a small portion of my meal I think it's safe to say I will probably not come back. While this place has healthy foods, brown rice, veggies, meat etc., we all know the unhealthiest part of a meal can be the sauces, and these meals are loaded with sauce. If you want no sauce, you can pretty much forget about ordering any kind of meat since they will not make them without. I like mild spice and had ordered the Korean steak bowl, my mouth was lit up after one bite. The girl at least offered to replace my meal. But overall, not the place for me."}
{"text":"Warning!!! I've never experienced food poisoning in my life till I had the steak bowl from this restaurant last week. I had watery diarrhea and vomiting for two days which caused me to lose 10 pounds. I have been eating at teriyaki boy for the past several years, but no longer will I risk my own health at this place. It's no surprise though. It took them no less than two minutes to have my meal ready. It must have been laying around all day just waiting for bacteria to grown on it and claim its next victim. Again, WARNING!!!"}
{"text":"First time here with my boys. I like the and $3.99 chicken bowl special!!! Great place to come with the kids after LVAC workout"}
{"text":"Awesome place! I really like the teriyaki chicken bowl special for only $3.99! The brown rice option is a plus - considering I'm picky with my brown rice. I prefer this place over other places."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery and it came early. The teriyaki steak bowl is great as is the chicken. In both cases I feel the veggies could be cooked slightly longer but it's not a huge deal, I would still order them again. The mango boba smoothie is like insanely mango if that makes sense like straight f***ing mango concentrate or somethin it's SO over powering."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Teriyaki Boy, and I ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl with white meat and brown rice, and a side of shrimp. The store was clean and the girl working the front counter was friendly. The only reason I gave 3 stars instead of 5 is because the chicken was dry, some of the brown rice was hard and the shrimp was way overcooked. However, the teriyaki sauce was yummy. The teriyaki bowl (regular size) is huge and I could only finish half!  I would give this place another shot,  maybe the cook was just having an off night."}
{"text":"im in love with their ahi tuna poke, its the best ive ever tried, what i love about it is the killer sauce that goes with it and how fresh it tastes, i could eat it all day! our food came out really fast and the place looks very clean (:  & if youre a green tea lover like me, their green tea boba is yummy !"}
{"text":"Fairly standard rice bowls with various toppings. They seem to be obsessed with bodybuilders. So if you like teriyaki sauce and very muscular people this is for you. If you just like teriyaki sauce and you are in the neighborhood it's worth a shot but I wouldn't make more than a 10-15 minute drive. Probably will not return."}
{"text":"If I can give it no stars... I would! Simply not a place that is managed well.  Been to this place multiple times but will not return. I thought I'd give the staff benefit of the doubt each time.   The last visit... called ahead of time for a simple pickup. Upon arrival; No customers, doesn't seem busy at all but still waited and waited and waited! What can you say about the food... it's teriyaki! Nothing special. What is even worse... (I hate to say it) the management/staff is disappointing every single  time. I support local businesses and franchises and hope each one the best but I don't think this one will last. DONT COME HERE! It'll just ruin your day and waste your time."}
{"text":"This place is amazin. The special is a great deal you can't go wrong. Healthy and bang for your buck. This location also has better service than others I've gone to"}
{"text":"Got the groupon and met my friend for lunch.  We both decided to get the steak/chicken teriyaki bowl. The cashier girl was less than inviting, whatever, I'm used to being treated like second class citizen with a groupon.   Two regular bowls + two drinks comes up to $16.77.  We both get our bowls and one of them is steak and chicken the other is just chicken. Uh......  I was too lazy to demand my steak, so I just ate my chicken instead.  Yeah, I could have made this at home. Nothing special and they give you a small portion of white rice, some sad veggies, and meat in a big bowl.   First and last time!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time and everything's normally always on point. Today was different though. I picked up a to go order of Mongolian Chicken, but when I got home it was beef and it was kind of cold, as if it was sitting there for a while. I only live 10 minutes away so it couldn't have gotten that cold in such a short amount of time. I also double checked the receipt to see if it said chicken or beef in case the cashier misheard me or if they gave me someone else's order on accident but they did make it without mushrooms like I asked. I tried calling back but no one was answering and they're supposed to still be open. I normally hate going to places minutes before closing but they were still open for another hour and now I feel like they just gave me leftovers so they can close early or something."}
{"text":"Just realized that this place is like less then 5 minutes from where I live so of course....I'm hungry and I gotta try it out.  :)  The place is small.  Only like 10 tables. BUT it is clean which I would hope since it's only been open less then a month.  :)  I'll come back for the Boba....was not feeling it today but the prices are comparable to China town, quality I have no idea but the pictures sure make it look tasty. ;)  The menu is big...almost too many choices I would say.   I ordered the tofu nugget yaki soba.   Pass on the tofu nugget.  It was kind of like soggy chicken nuggets with some grated carrots and edamame mixed into it. Not tasty at all.  Blah  But the rest of yaki soba was pretty good. Veggies were still crunchy and not overcooked.  The noodle had good texture.    Minus one star for the soggy tofu nuggets.... Minus the second star for drowning the bowl in teriyaki sauce.  I get the healthy part because it was grilled but the drowning in the sauce kind of defeats the purpose of \"healthy\".  But I will definitely try it again and next time I will ask for light sauce.  :)"}
{"text":"Read a lot of reviews saying this place was good and healthy. I however give this place 2 1/2 stars. Walking in I got a fast food meet Chinese restaurant vibe. It was very small with few seatings. There was only 2 workers one working the front and the other was the cook. The menu was limited and when my friend and I were trying to ask about the menu the girl didn't seem to know herself what was in what or the kind of veggies in it. We told her it was our first time here and she didn't try to explain anything to us.  My friend ended up getting a chicken teriyaki rice bowl with brown rice and I got the chicken teriyaki soba noodle bowl. We waited awhile for our food and when it came out it wasn't even hot. More warm closer to cool. My friend didn't get brown rice but didn't even want to ask them remake it since we waited awhile already. My noodle bowl was meh. I had to add more sauce and hot sauce for flavor and my chicken was very dry. The veggies were cut up too big and chunky filling more then half the bowl ( I love my veggies don't get me wrong) but with the noodles being at the bottom there was no room for me to stir or mix my food. We ended up throwing around 3/4 of our food.  If I were to come back I would definitely be more specific about everything (i.e. Cut the veggies up more, add more sauce, brow rice...)"}
{"text":"Definitely a must try awesome customer service and great food, perfect place to come to after your workout"}
{"text":"I love teriyaki boy, it's a great option after the gym and the food is prepared really healthy! Try the low carb bowl!"}
{"text":"Yo les recomiendo que vengan a comer a este lugar la comida está muy buena y barata el pollo está exquisito se los recomiendo"}
{"text":"Convenient healthy meal option after a workout at LVAC in the same building. Surprisingly flavorful for health food. Get the sauces on the side and steer clear of the appetizers.  Salmon wrap with extra veggies is my go-to, but the Mongolian beef bowl backs a punch of protein as well- filling and flavorful, ask to add extra garlic. In addition to wraps, bowls, and apps, the menu has protein smoothies and boba drinks.   Meals are generally under $10/person, unless you Jay-Cutter-size it. Restaurant is clean, employees are efficient, lots of random Buddha statues on display. Can't think of any other healthy options in the area, very good location for them to be."}
{"text":"Good food! Easy, convenient and fast. Variety in menu items. Will definitely come again. Everyday special is only 3.59."}
{"text":"Very good and healthy I go here after I work out the food is excellent. Lots of steam vegetables fresh baked chicken I love it."}
{"text":"I purchased a groupon to try this place out because it is close to the gym and our new place but I will not be back. The young lady that was working tonight at the counter was quite rude for no reason and looked at me like I was an idiot when I asked if there were veggies in the bowl because when I said no veggies she looked bewildered. We ordered a steak bowl and recieved a chicken bowl the brown rice almost chipped my tooth. Thank you for the bad attitude and poor quality food luckily it was half off."}
{"text":"Meh.    I didn't walk into Teriyaki Boy with a lot of expectations for great cuisine.  Here's what I wanted: a nice, healthy, quick food option with Teriyaki flavor.  But the restaurant somehow managed to dash those expectations.  I'm just not enthusiastic about anything we ordered.  The crab Rangoon tasted like it had been thawed and served up (i.e. all flavor was lost long ago while the food waited in a freezer).  The eggs rolls were appropriately crisp, but tasteless.  We drowned them in sweet and sour sauce in order to produce a taste.  We finally found a little flavor in the Teriyaki chicken bowl -- and the Teriyaki flavor wasn't bad.  But the dish came with boatload of rice with a meager serving of vegetables and chicken.  Sigh.  When you find a dish with a little flavor in this place, they skimp on the flavor and cover it in unseasoned rice.  Basically, I walked in hoping for the McDonald's of Teriyaki cuisine.  Problem is, McDonald's actually works hard to make sure it's food is flavorful use a whole lot of chemicals to keep the flavoring even after the food is frozen.  So, skip Teriyaki Boy.  It's a step under McDonald's."}
{"text":"I think the word \"healthy\" is the main theme instead of \"teriyaki\".  Basically everything is steamed: the rice, the vegetables, and the meat... put all 3 in a bowl then top with some teriyaki sauce.  If you're looking for the traditional Japanese teriyaki flavor meal, you might be up for disappointment."}
{"text":"He was nice ! So sweet and I enjoyed visiting . Food is amazing he was helpful with tha app and showed us how to use it"}
{"text":"Just got done working out and needed a quick meal! Stopped by tonight around 9 because I needed a quick meal. Been here a few times now and I think it's pretty good! Your usual teriyaki spot it's like any other place. The prices range anywhere from $7-$10 dollars. It's a small place on rainbow and warm springs, so I usually just do take out orders. They're friendly and usually quick! Which is good for me since I'm always on the go. The portions are good for what you pay and I've never had a problem with the food being undercooked. The firecracker bowl is pretty spicy so watch out for that! Overall I don't mind coming here if I want a quick meal that fits my daily diet."}
{"text":"I love healthy food and teriyaki boy is my favorite way better than teriyaki madness tha best teriyaki bowls in town. I can eat here everyday.  My favorite is the chicken yakisoba and the best thing about it is the noodles is made out of wheat, it's really healthy.  I love the fact that teriyaki boy serves the food fresh, hot and well cooked. The teriyaki sauce is so good..  The service was wonderful and employees were super nice and knowledgeble.  I'm definitely coming back here. This place is awesome.. Keep it up.. The best place to eat you can eat good and healthy at the same time.. :) i LOVE teriyaki boy"}
{"text":"Teriyaki boy health grill is the place to go when you just get off of work, school or any occasion. Their food is always fresh and delicious. The egg rolls are the best because they're not greasy. Let's say I can have this food a few days a week and it get tired."}
{"text":"We really like this place for a quick, healthy meal. I like the chicken teriyaki bowl with white meat or the Jay Cutler bowl. Fresh veggies and grilled chicken breast. I'm not usually a fan of Asian food but I like this. The sauce comes on the side, too."}
{"text":"Love their firecracker bowl its always enough food and they customize the vegetables how i like it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Great food for the price, very affordable and I love their specials!! Love the firecracker chicken and sweet chili chicken bowl!! And the crab puffs are to die for!!! Great for an after workout meal and conveniently located next to the gym LVAC!"}
{"text":"Well this was my first time and the last time Im going to this place. The staff were friendly, but everyone has pickup orders and I was a walk in. ( I got there first and was serviced last) I got the large bowl at the top of the menu with steak. Steak was good, rice was not. Was not fully cooked and the portions were too large. Ate the steak and trashed the rice....three stars for register girl and streak..."}
{"text":"Came here to try something different with my family. Great selection for me and the kids, reasonable prices for such large portions. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I am so happy that my friend showed me this place! Now I know where to go to get healthy food without guilt. Great place to meet gym friends!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They give you a good portion of food for a VERY reasonable price. A nice vegan selection as well & the food tastes great. Y'all have my heart & my money.   PS the staff has always been really kind, no problems ever."}
{"text":"Was picking something from Albertsons and saw the sign advertising $3.99 chicken teriyaki bowl.  Thought \"wow, that's cheap! Decided to order it Togo instead of making dinner. While placing my orders the cashier ask what size...I told her 1 large which I knew the price would be more but the 2nd order is small or regular size whatever it comes in. My total came out to be $13.28 I asked her why she charged $5.99 for the regular or small when it advertises $3.99.  Cashier lady said the $3.99 was for a really small portion. Regular size costs more. FALSE ADVERTISE!!! Don't fall for it. Will not go back for such deceptive technique."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time tonight and the service was fast and portion size generous.  Ordered the steak and broccoli with brown rice. The steak was tasty but a bit grizzly and fatty. My wife had the chicken which was much better.  Broccoli was good but the rice was mushy. W"}
{"text":"Great experience overall, very polite and excellent customer service every time I come here to this location. Very quick with orders and the food taste great! Would highly recommend. Thank you Terriyaki Boy!"}
{"text":"This is the best place to go to get a great meal at a great price! The service here is always top notch. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a great healthy meal! The jay cutler bowl is best!"}
{"text":"I'll admit that I probably would not have tried this place if not for Groupon's deal here one day.  But that's what Groupon is for, right?  And now, because of it, I shall return.  This place is close to me and is a nice break from Teriyaki Madness.  Don't get me wrong - I like both!  But Teriyaki Boy does have a better menu selection and has boba.  I do like my boba.  The service was wonderful and employees were cheerful and knowledgeable.  Order was up fairly fast without skimping on presentation or quality.  Awesome.  What to order: Honestly, I had a teriyaki chicken bowl with veggies and it was fantastic.  Veggies are steamed to perfection, the chicken quality is great and overall very pleasing.  Edamame is good, too.  I also had a coconut boba.  While not the best I have ever had, it was certainly buy-again worthy!  P.S. The mirrors in this place really threw me off for a moment.  It's not large at all.  And there is not another room off to the left when you first walk in lol."}
{"text":"Guy at register was really helpful helping me decide which sauce to get on my chicken bowl. I got the Kung pao sauce which was really good. Nice little healthy meal over brown rice"}
{"text":"I would give it no stars. They close the grill TWO HOURS before close!! Basically go here if you want rice. AND FROZEN BOBAS!! Yes. Frozen. Thought I could have a simple order of a boba smoothie, but it's an understatement to say this place needs better management."}
{"text":"Pretty good food!  I like the white chicken teriyaki bowl, and dh goes for the chicken yakisoba bowl.  Prices are good, food is fresh and low fat.  Not the most exciting tastes out there, but if you want inexpensive and healthy food prepared lightning fast, this place will do the trick. Only caveat is that there's never enough teriyaki sauce on the food, and if you buy more they charge .25 per teensy container, so get some teriyaki glaze at the grocery to use when you want extra sauce."}
{"text":"It first time here at Teriyaki Boy Healthy Grill. I looking for something on the healthy side after doing an one hour bike class. I always notice this place on my way too and from class. So figure why not give it try! Teriyaki chicken it kind of is what it is for me. Not that big of fan but look at it as more of an inexpensive meal. I normally go too Teriyaki Madness since its closer too my side of town. Always enjoy mixing the food palate up.  I ordred the large teriyaki chicken bowl. I enjoyed! I thought the chicken was grilled right on nice char grill marks on both sides and nice moist. I like the vegetables they served sliced carrots (unlike more mass market or dime dozen teriyaki chicken bowls either shredded or big chunks sometimes not even cooked but raw), zucchini (again usually broccoli find), and course traditional pieces of cabbage. The teriyaki sauce not fan of overkill. So for me liked fact they have enough covered the chicken and get into the vegetables. The white rice was cooked perfect.  I surprise that the menu was pretty diverse from the appetizers, the alternatives comes too brown rice, or subbing different things in it. They even offer Jay Cutler size bowl. If you don't know Jay Cutler he won the Mr Olympia before. So its big boy bowl one that if your hungry should think about ordering.   Talk about small place and unfortunately located right next too LVAC so they get lot of post workout meals. I just barely found spot too eat on the counter area. If theres a  negative always positive? You can feel fit, healthy, or feel like busted sweat at the gym at Teriyaki Boy."}
{"text":"Initially I would go here for their boba smoothies. The service was bad in the past so I gave up. I recently gave their food a try after the gym (with an expired Groupon voucher). I will say their service has improved tons! Their bowls are so yummy! This is one of my new favorite healthy eats post-workouts. I'm glad I gave it a second chance!"}
{"text":"When I saw this was opening up by my house I was super excited. I couldn't wait, we actually went once and it wasn't open yet, bummer.   So we finally got a chance to try it. I ordered the firecracker chicken bowl. Do you love spice? Well I do and this definitely hit the spot! There is a lot on the menu so I had to ask and the guy recommended it. He even asked if I wanted it medium or hot..I said hot!!! It came with brown rice, veggies and really good chicken tossed in spicy, sweet chili sauce. Only suggestion is maybe to put the sauce on the veggies too, they were a bit bland compared to the entire meal but still yum!!!My son tried the Korean steak bowl and I am assuming he loved it because he ate it all up without me having to tell him to finish it. Haha!   The service was good too, the guy welcomed us and helped us along with our order since it was our first time."}
{"text":"I decided to finally try this place about 4 days ago and I LOVE IT! I have been back every day for lunch. Its fresh, healthy and quick. The employees are very friendly as well as the owner whos a very nice man who really does everything he can to make you leave happy! I get the Low Carb Chicken Bowl w/extra spicy on it and its delicious! The veggies are steamed to perfection, I order it w/o carrots and they actually pick them out for me, and have the few times ive asked, added a little bit of brown rice (very little) to my bowl for no extra charge... I will continue to come back here... also make sure to ask for a stamp card and your 12th bowl is free!!! Way better than Terrayki Madness or anyother Terrayki place ive been in a long time!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place went south. We used to come here for good teriyaki bowls and good Asian salads and they used to be served freshly prepared.  They're meat used to be freshly grilled, now it seems like they just reheat Pre-grilled  steak, and served really dry like jerky-dry. I ordered a salad and the wonton crisp strips tasted like they've been in storage for years, like rancid old grease... So disappointed.   Service went bad too. They have a cashier that barely comprehends English and just nods to everything, like when I had a question about an item, she would nod and just add the item I was asking about to our order assuming we wanted to order it. So frustrating. Ugh! Really disappointed."}
{"text":"Great service and quality. Staff is very pleasant and food is good. I usually come here twice a week and I've never once had a bad experience with my food or the customer service. I remember a couple weeks back the AC was out, and even though it felt like I had walked into an oven that had been left on for a couple days, the staff was still extremely pleasant and didn't display any sign of frustration or irritation, which I truly respect and admire. I truly hope that management takes notice of this and reward these employees because they deserve it!!"}
{"text":"Is the best place to eat and my favorite plate the fired craker   just the way I like it super spice, workers are really nice  and fast service"}
{"text":"Great, fresh food! The Mongolian beef and pot stickers are my favorite!! The poke is also good. Teriyaki boy is def my favorite fast teriyaki spot"}
{"text":"I tried two dishes to be delivered to our hotel, however they were both quite disappointing.  The chicken bowl was chicken breast grilled/baked on top of rice. Without the sweet sauce they provided, this tastes like cardboard. Meat is very dry and not seasoned well.  The yakisoba bowl or maybe Chowmein was edible, however not at restaurant level either.  This is probably the worst food I have ever eaten in my life. Although we had a great time eating it since we ate it by the pool at Mandalay Bay. :D"}
{"text":"Skip this place. I sat waiting for a regular teriyaki bowl for 30 minutes and the lady said nothing except it was coming. Didn't come for 15 more minutes. They had so many people waiting for their food people started walking out. I have been here so many times and it has always taken 10 minutes maximum for a food order. The service has gone downhill. There is a place right across from EOS on Stephanie that has incredible food and service and more options. Worth the drive."}
{"text":"Used to love this place until I found a crispy little roach in my chicken bowl."}
{"text":"They have really great service and very clean! A lot of healthy choices and with a very helpful staff!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Quick and yummy! I always get the hi ken teriyaki bowl with mushrooms and it's always good. Had an appetizer once that wasn't great, but it was free with a yelp check-in so no biggie."}
{"text":"Used to go here about 4 nights a week right after the gym. About a year ago, this place was great. Then it started to go downhill - fast. That says a lot about ownership not paying attention. The people they have hired over the last several months have the absolute worst attitudes. I even had one time a girl tried to tell me they were closed (early) and that they were out of chicken. The male working there told me they do have chicken and that girl was trying to go home early. Now they no longer give discount to gym members. Portion sizes are about half of what they used to be. Service is worse than the Shell station employees down the street. On top of all that - the last two times I went there to pick up a to go order, they were missing extra chicken we had paid for and gave us white rice instead of brown rice that we ordered. Sorry teriyaki boy owner, but you should have been paying better attention. $18 times 4 nights a week lost from us."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this review is for the SERVICE, not the food.  The Teriyaki Boy on Rainbow is less than a half mile from my place, but I drive the 3 miles to Samari Sam's. Why?  For the same price, and food quality, I can insure that it's open. Not once or twice, but THREE times, I have been to Teriyaki Boy and they have turned me away, when their hours said they were open, and there were people inside. Once 30 minutes before close, and today, an hour and a half before they should have been closed.  Another day I walked up to see the restaurant empty and the doors closed when the hours clearly stated it was open.   TBHG, if you're not going to be open, why not just change your hours on the door? Don't send people away when you've got people sitting in the dining room and you're supposed to be open."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered uber eats and asked for extra chicken and steak in our bowls. Didn't seem like extra to us. The food is alright but not worth 10 dollars a bowl. They also advertise as healthy food, however the food was pretty greasy."}
{"text":"It is awesome delicious as well as nutritious great place to eat . I got the big boy bowl my absolute favorite with a boba smoothie as well. Teriyaki boy #1."}
{"text":"I'll start off with what was good with my visit. I enjoyed the sticky rice, nice amount of sauce on top of my chicken teriyaki bowl and nice service.  Unfortunately, it was 89F in there making it a legit sauna. My chicken was curiously cooler than the ambient temperature. The broccoli was slightly more crunchy than I normally like.  Back to it being a sauna. The person said the owner knew about the broken AC but hasn't been able to fix it yet. How long has it been broken for, the three employees have to work in that for their shifts?!"}
{"text":"Ordered a teriyaki bowl for myself and child they didn't put the teriyaki sauce on either nor veggies on my daughters. They told me they don't put veggies into their childrens teriyaki bowls. When the adult ones come with it and its not listed without veggies on the childrens. They just wanted me to pay more and wait around on them to make it and I was in a rush. I preordered from a app 2 hours beforehand! So it would be good to go and I had to wait for my order that they messed up on and wanted to charge me more for!!! The employees got irritated when I asked for teriyaki sauce for both the bowls and they seemed frustrated me needing it. Uhmmmm really??? I will order inside and not through a app from now on, so the employees don't pull the acting dumb routine. I would eat there again because the food is good but their customer service blows..."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery through grub hub... my big boy bowl that cost $13+ with extra veggies and 'spicy' arrived with no sauce on it nor on the side... the couple of pieces of broccoli that were on it were pretty much raw... as was the zucchini.. I called and was told that if I wanted to get my money back is have to call grubhub... I questioned 'why', since they made the order and will get the money obviously and was told there was nothing they could do... so I habe no meal and out cost us $50+ for the 2 of us.... never again will i attempt eating their... if they had been apologetic and tried to do something for me, maybe... never once did they say 'sorry' or offer to bring me sauce... anything that would have made this okay.  If I could give zero stars I would.  Update... 10 minutes on hold with grubhub, they called the restaurant and the restaurant said they could refund the price of the item... so they basically just made me sit on the phone with grubhub and I still have no meal"}
{"text":"Great option if you're looking to be healthy, but still love food. Very satisfying portions, as well. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Healthy? Probably not Fresh?  Compaired to whom! McDonald's... sure Delicious?  Hell yeah! very much addictive  I've been trying to get ther teriyaki sauce recipe for a while. Bribe and interigate  them a very time I'm in there.  Wheres jack bower when you need him."}
{"text":"I ordered through uber eats . It was made fast and everything is delicious . I had the chicken teriyaki bowl and pot stickers , which were great!"}
{"text":"I ordered off UberEATS; when the food was delivered, it was still hot (which is great)! I ordered a Mongolian beef and was super excited to try it out. I can't say I was disappointed but I can't say I was impressed, either. The portion was pretty big compared to what I normally eat so it was worth it. The beef was really difficult to chew but it had a lot of flavor. I guess it was my fault for ordering beef instead of chicken. My favorite part of the bowl were the vegetables, the bell peppers were sweet and cooked very well! The rice was good, too. I just wish I remembered to ask for more sauce on the side for the rice. I think I might stop by this restaurant sometime to try their food in-house!"}
{"text":"The food is usually okay but the staff is not. I only go here when I get done working out late and greens and Proteins is closed. If you are in a jam this place works but I would call in the order so you don't have to deal with the staff."}
{"text":"I go here usually about once a week and the food is fairly good I just ate there about two hours ago and I put this on my life it was raw chicken I got a large bowl with brown meat and white rice I would normally recommend it but after that I will never go back again"}
{"text":"UPDATE: man. I came in today 2/19 and 8:10pm. I literally stood at the register for 10 minutes waiting for someone to take my order. I even asked the bald dude if they were open just to get their attention. The lady with the big head cant even fit her head. She even looked back and continued to mess around with some sauces. Like you coulda took my order then get back to it. So annoying. Looks like they have a sanitary problem though. There was raw chicken in a container that wasn't seal right on the trash can. Good thing I didn't get the chicken. My crab puffs were slightly cold on the inside and wasn't even crispy. The texture was super soft like it was heated in the microwave. My Korean chicken was also cold. Like really? This place deserves to be shut down. Or hire better staff members.  Or maybe get bigger hats so they can think how to cook better           This restaurant is really clean! I always get the everyday special which is only 3.99. Definitely a place you should try. Especially if you work out at LVAC in the area!"}
{"text":"I always order from this location. They always promptly have my order ready for me when I call ahead. By far Teriyaki boy is my go to choice over other teriyaki places. Their portions and prices are always generous. And their strawberry boba smoothie is awesome! Highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"I went to this place almost everyday until they desired to start cutting their portions and taking forever to get an order out. I waited 45 minutes for a regular chicken bowl that never came while being told it would be out in five minutes time and time again. Don't eat at this place!!!"}
{"text":"I typically love this place, but what's up with the mongolian bowl- just ordered it and had it delivered via bite squad...paid 15$ total and literally a pound of white rice in there....thats pretty cheap of you guys, i even paid extra for the broccoli upgrade...please make a note on the menu that you put a ton of white rice in the bowl, so those of us who do not like white rice can opt for something else. Esp since you consider yourselves a healthy grill, brown rice is a better option."}
{"text":"I usually go next door to Saigon 8 with my boys, but this time I decided to try something new. I figure it would be healthy and cheap. I ordered the chicken low carb bowl, my boys got the noodle bowl w/chicken and sweet and sour chicken, my husband got the beef broccoli bowl, and we ordered boba smoothies for the boys. When the food arrived it was very simple and had absolutely no flavor. We had to add soy sauce and sarachi to give it some sort of taste.  I could have simple bought a Asian stir fry vegetable kit from the grocery store and grilled two chicken breast for a lot cheaper.  Very little food, no taste, and over priced. These people that eat here after the gym must be VERY hungry to eat this crap. I give them two thumbs down and a double HELL NO!!!"}
{"text":"The Daily Special bowl is perfect! Great price and just enough food to get my energy back up. The service is excellent, and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"This place is great. Plenty of healthy choices to choose from. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly and they always acknowledge you by letting you know that they will be right with because they are always busy! Definitely a place I come back to as often as I can!"}
{"text":"used uber eats to order from here. Had the teriyaki chicken bowl. Very fresh and delicious. Husband ordered the Mongolian beef and a side salad , both where also very  fresh and  delicious. The rice was very fluffy and soft. The driver was here 10 minutes  early and very  friendly.  Hungry?

{"text":"Young lady was very nice, I've ate here many times and I really enjoy their food. Service is great!"}
{"text":"I always drive pazst this place and it's usually packed! Today I decided to check it out and I was not dissapointed!! The service here is top-notch!! They answered all my questions and explained the menu items to me! The food is both awesome and healthy, can't beat that!!!"}
{"text":"The staff here is friendly and the food is awesome. The daily special is great as well. I'm in here at least twice a week"}
{"text":"Loved it. Great good. Great service. Highly recommend this place!! I got the daily special. Packed with chicken and veggies"}
{"text":"First time at Teryaki Boy. I have heard nothing but good things. Menu looks great! Can't wait to try my Korean BBQ bowl!"}
{"text":"Kyle was so awesome, when I came to pick up my order it was already to go ! This store I would recommend :)"}
{"text":"This place don't even deserve a one star from me. I came in tonight for 2 Korean BBQ steak bowls and it took them almost 20 mins to have the order out. The girl at the register has no sense of urgency or any customer service skills at all.  The place is so small that all the tables are so close to eachother which makes it so uncomfortable . So many people just sitting there and waiting on their food. So we decided to go home.  I asked for 1/2 the veggie they normally put bit they ended up putting extra. So much rice and veggies and little meat also The meat is lack of flavor, the worst part is I found hair in bowl which is completely nasty. Never again"}
{"text":"Second go round, we used the drive up window. Order was short 1 yaki soba bowl...I called and a girl said she would tell someone I would be getting it tomorrow...um we shall see how that goes...  Hubby got sweet and sour shrimp, which he had last time as well, but he said he didn't like the sauce this time. Also had the chicken daily special, he liked that.  Friend had oriental chicken salad, it was ok. She also had chicken daily special.  I did not have anything, my order was not in the bag....lol  The first trip we tried the Mongolian chicken, never again....seriously Crab puffs were really good! Steak and broccoli which was ok  So I still want to try the yaki soba..lol"}
{"text":"My husband and I love going to teriyaki boy after working out. We love getting the jay cutler steak bowl. Super tasty and satisfying for two. Customer service can be better and charging $0.40 for brown rice is sort of ridiculous especially when it's a healthy restaurant grill."}
{"text":"My husband and I were going to watch a movie and this was pretty close to the movie theater so we decided to give this a try. VERY BAD IDEA.   First off... The decor was worst then the dirty Chinese fast food restaurants ... Bad sign. I don't get the logo... It doesn't even look like I'm going to get \"buff\" or healthy from eating here. I should of trust my initial instincts.   Second, the grilled beef protein was extremely chewy that I don't think my dog will even eat it. It was that bad.   Third, the super buff guy sitting in front of us just went into the man's restroom and he went back to his seat and we noticed a wet stain on the back of his pants before we even took a bite of our lunch.  Whoever wrote nice reviews for this place probably think Panda Express is real Asian food."}
{"text":"Dirty dining really!? I eat there all the time... I'm disgusted... damn ... couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the report... I wanted to puke... You lost a customer such a shame I loved your food ..."}
{"text":"Fiya!!! That's how my mouth feels, but it hurts so good!  If you what to spice up your life take a chance at the firecracker chicken!  It's fiya!  I got the large which was lots of food for the price.  I've also tried the everyday chicken bowl special.  It's a bargain at $3.99 you get a good portion of food from rice to chicken and veggies. Instead of fast greasy food get the daily social!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Fast, simple, and healthy.  If your on a budget and trying to keep those calories in check.  Teriyaki boy has the solution!  Everyday special for $3.99! You get rice, chicken, and mixed veggies.  Who says you can't eat healthy fast food!  My favorite is the firecracker chicken.  There is some heat to it but the rice and the veggies balance it out.  It's flavorful, fulfilling, and affordable.    Check in on yelp and receive a free order of pot stickers!  They have boba and protein drinks also."}
{"text":"Very affordable. Gave them 1 star because I saw a roach on the floor. Makes me wonder how clean they keep this place. Hesitant about coming back."}
{"text":"It's cheap, simple and taste pretty good.  $3.99 chicken bowl with white rice and veggies. Great lunch/dinner portions for us females. What more can you possibly ask for...especially for that price? This is a good alternative for me whenever I crave a quick and simple teriyaki chicken rice bowl. This special is good 7 days a week and you don't need a coupon or anything.  There's a Yelp check-in offer for a free order of gyoza dumplings but it's not valid on the regular sized bowls....only the large ones. Just an FYI."}
{"text":"So bomb you just gotta try it. Like bomb bomb   Uhhknjov jiijjiijb more Guygy couch I've had it just use Huh huh fuck this Eric did such stay rush rush Did you use did wish rush will tried so he say had"}
{"text":"Definitely health conscious and absolutely delicious! I ended up getting the Korean BBQ bowl with half brown and half white rice and it was no problem mixing the rices. Everything is made to order and fresh. Vegetables and piping hot. The large bowls are great if you're really hungry and need the calories. They have a diverse menu. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"It wasn't great, also wasn't bad. Just an average teriyaki bowl that did its job in filling me up. Chicken was a little dry and it was a little overpriced. If you need a quick bite to fill you up and have 10 bucks for a bowl of rice and chicken this is your spot."}
{"text":"Great healthy food for after the gym I recommend the Jay Cutler Bowl.12iz of white meat over rice with minced garlic i found my new spot for sure. Plus great customer service what else can i say."}
{"text":"We ordered from this place through Uber Eats. It specifically gets you to check a box for spicy or not spicy food. We checked not spicy. The food arrived about 45 minutes later and it's spicy. I called the store and asked for their help, but they passed all the responsibility to Uber Eats even though the guy on the phone made the comment \"I don't know why it doesn't say on our menu that this is a spicy dish\".   I asked if I could speak to the manager about it and he told me they would give me the same answer because \"This has happened many times before\". There is an obvious problem that they should fix to avoid this, but they don't care because they just pass the buck to Uber Eats."}
{"text":"Great selection, way more better than Panda Express. Everything tastes fresh :)"}
{"text":"First time here. Yummy food. I had the Korean Chicken Bowl and my husband had Steak Teriyaki Bowl and devoured it. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"I have always been a big fan of all things teriyaki. Unfortunately, im not a fan of this place. Let me explain.  Any time I go to a teriyaki place, I always get the chicken n beef combo because come on, you get two kinds of meat and you cant really mess that up right? Here they kind of did ok. You have two choices of sizes. Regular and Large. The large is only 50 cents more so might as well right?   So here's why im not too fond of this place. The chicken was dry. I had to douse it with teriyaki sauce and sriracha just to make it edible. I wanted brown rice instead of white. They charge you 40 cents for that while some other places don't. The large was not that much bigger. My total came out to 9 bucks and some change. That's without any drinks included. Easily would of been over 10 bucks if I did.  So I stand corrected. I never really had much of anything negative to mention. Until I ate here. The only saving grace that is preventing me from giving them 1 star is that the beef is actually good.  I have actually been here twice. Once with company that wanted to go here and this second time around because I thought the first time was a fluke. Unfortunately, this second visit verified what I thought all along."}
{"text":"I've never had such a gross tasting teriyaki bowl in my life. I am far from a picky eater but this place served me an inedible salmon bowl and I will not be returning. The salmon had the texture of a chicken nugget-- like mix meat. It had no grains in it and did not resemble any piece of salmon I've ever seen. The teriyaki sauce had an odd taste to it and the rice was completely overlooked and swishy. On top of it all, the service was underwhelming. No wonder the place was desolate."}
{"text":"This place deserves less than one star. I waited 50 minutes for my order. Then they tell me my order has been ready for 40 minutes. Didn't offer to remake it."}
{"text":"Wow if I could give a 0 then they would definitely get one.  I had my heart set on a steak and broccoli bowl, but did I get it? Nope!!  Went in, no cashier at the counter. Just the cook preparing someone else's food. He saw me standing there, but didn't even bother to call someone to take my order. Stood at the counter for about 4 minutes and still no one. It wasn't very busy either. So I finally got annoyed and left. I think an employee finally walked in right as I was walking out the door. But who cares?? They lost my business. Your loss, cuz I actually liked you guys. So I just walked to Greens & Proteins for my after-workout meal."}
{"text":"Drive thru sucks they have mess up on my order several times and this will be the last time I come here."}
{"text":"So I would give 41/2 stars but since that isn't allowed you get all 5!  So I have been eating at this place for I would say a week.  Sure I like poke bowls, teriyaki bowls, basically I like food in a bowl I guess.  I had never heard of Teriyaki Boy but thought I was in the mood and so I saw them on Postmates and they were quick so I thought let's give them a try.  Let me tell you I have since ordered at least 4 or 5 times now.  So much food, big bowls, Mongolian steak, teriyaki steak, teriyaki chicken, shrimp man they are all just fantastic.  Just tried the Jay C. bowl and man I couldn't even finish it so much to eat.  Reason for 41/2 stars would be the crab puffs are all puffs no filling.  Will try a few more dishes but the truth is the Mongolian Steak with xtra vegies is just my jam right now.  Keep up the good work Teriyaki Boy."}
{"text":"I'd definitely recommend this over Panda Express or anything like that. So much healthier and tastier. Plus they make it as you order. Unlike Panda where it sits there already made."}
{"text":"Teriyaki Boy!!!! Kyle and Alex are making it happen!  Stopped by for a quick lunch for the 1st time after my mani pedi next door and found a new spot!  Come chop it up with the boys!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Come here all the time with my friends for a nice healthy meal after a good workout."}
{"text":"We came over here because Pho was pretty busy. But this was a good find. Food was quick and chicken was cooked through. Potstickers were pretty good too."}
{"text":"This place was a rip off. I paid $9 for less than mediocre food and the portions were ridiculous. I got a large portion, and the bowl was not filled, more than 3/4 was just rice, and had very little veggies or meat. I asked the cashier before hand some questions and she was apathetic and unhelpful. Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Mediocre customer service to \"barely\" greet you and take your order. If you don't specify the size of bowl you want they'll charge and serve you the LARGEST size. And, after they pump out your meal, it's wrong. No plans to return here, ever..."}
{"text":"This is the best teriyaki boi in town. Very clean and well managed! The staff is friendly and helpful in answering our questions. Get fit and fueled after your workout with the best!!"}
{"text":"We love the one in henderson, but this new on on Rainbow, is the slowest service ever, 30 mins for 3 bowls, when nobody else is in here? Plus it seems more expensive then the one in Henderson. Looks like we will just drive to Henderson for now on"}
{"text":"Cashier didn't speak when walking in even though there was nobody inside before us. Clean environment and chilled atmosphere, however we got large bowls and felt shorted with meat and rice when we received our order. Feeling unfulfilled. I would reconsider coming to this location."}
{"text":"super low quality food.. i got microwaved soggy veggies that were half hot half frozen"}
{"text":"Jahnae and Jennifer are bomb! Pickup orders in a timely manner and clean establishment. They also have boba which is tasty and offer 14 flavors."}
{"text":"I drive by this place all the time.  First I look at the massive gym behind and think to myself that I need to work out.  As I think about working out I get hungry.  This is when I notice the Healthy grill.  Then I always say I'm going to check that place out someday and then forget that I need to work out.    I was at work and couldn't decide on what I wanted to eat.  I really didn't want a boring sandwich or something fried that was going to put me down at my desk.  Just then I remembered about this place by the gym.  I read some of the Yelp reviews and then I was off to go get my bowl on.  When I arrived the restaurant wasn't packed, but there was a few people and no line.    I really struggled to give this place 4 stars.  The reason was because the girl at the counter was really rude.  This was the first time I have ever been here and was asking some questions.  She seemed annoyed and just wanted to take my order.  I was upset because there wasn't anybody behind me.  After asking a few questions I finally gave up and realized she was visibly upset.  I though maybe I caught her on an off day or she just had a rush.  Oh well, there's really no excuse to be rude.    In case you were wondering I was asking about the Jay Cutler bowl.  This bowl looked like a man's bowl of food.  It was huge!  I will have to order it someday.    I ended up ordering the small bowl because I didn't want a big lunch.  It was priced pretty well.  and it had vegetables.  I am amazed that the other places charge you for vegetables.  Really?  Other than the girl be rude the overall experience was good for my stomach and wallet.  If you are in the area or at the gym go check it out.  I hope you get a friendlier girl or guy at the counter.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"It is amazing, love the food had a satisfying experience . There are different  verity of healthy options besides the bowls, they have dumplings, wraps and a lot more  ."}
{"text":"Ehhh. Underwhelmed. I mean, it was okay. Just okay.  This location is next to Pho Saigon 8 right next to that massive LVAC compound off of 215 and Eastern.  1 teriyaki chicken bowl and i regular drink was just under 10.00 and left me unsatiated. The chicken was good, the rice soggy, and there were way too many veggies getting in the way there. Like I said, it wasn't bad, I just had high hopes for something better.  Ever since I moved to LV from Phoenix I have been unable to find a great Teriyaki Chicken bowl in this town. Why is  it so tough to find a place that will give you a good size portion of rice with alot of tasty chicken smothered in teriyaki sauce? Sounds simple, no? Thats what I was hoping to find here, but no luck. :(  The service was okay the chicken was okay, but I can't see myself going out of my way at all to come back."}
{"text":"I really, really, REALLY wanted to like this place. I have now been here 3 times in the last 2 weeks in an effort for them to make it right.   Visit #1: Ordered the $3.99 Teriyaki Bowl \"special\". (See photos) Rice portion size was fair, but meat portion was a straight up joke! The thing is, what I did have tasted very good! Chicken was tender and tasty..that is, the 4 or 5 bite portion I was served..  Ok, I think, I will try again..  Visit #2: Try the large Teriyaki Chicken Bowl with no Veggies. For $7 and change, the portion size is very good....for the rice...the meat was ok...but...chock FULL of veggies..  A) I ordered no veggies B) I tried to eat the veggies and they were stiff and tasted terrible! If they were steamed/cooked them for a little while longer than I wouldn't have minded it so much...but it was just terrible trying to finish eating them!  Strike Two.  Visit #3: Ordered Same item as visit #2, but tipped Girl $2 and asked Girl to PLEASE not include veggies.  Again, what meat I got tasted really good. Tender and juicy. Just not nearly enough of it! This time the rice was so stiff and stale I could not finish it. In fact, I tossed it out.  That's it. I tried. I am officially done with Teriyaki Boy.  What a letdown.  2 stars.  Meh. I have experienced better."}
{"text":"I loved my meal. I had teriyaki steak and chicken bowl. My roommate had the same. Both were cooked fresh and the portions were good. Im a plus sized model and I was stuffed. Had fresh veggies as well. Yummi."}
{"text":"On more than one occasion I have stopped here for my lunch breaks and although the drive through makes this place convenient I'm still not sold on returning. The teriyaki sauce is good but the meat falls short in taste with lack of freshness and flavor. The prices are reasonable considering it is a, \"healthy grill\" but I prefer to pay an extra dollar for a better quality chicken breast. The customer service, rice and veggies are great but I'm not a fan. This establishment has the potential to step up their game and dominate the location since there's not many \"healthy\" restaurants in that location."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here while visiting Vegas.  I don't know what all the fuss was about because we were pretty unimpressed.  The rice was fairly good, the veggies as well.  There wasn't enough chicken in the Chicken Tereyaki Bowl and the sauce, although it originally tasted fine, seemed to disappear and after a few minutes you couldn't taste it at all.  I wish we would've gone somewhere else.  It's fast food, but in my opinion not GOOD fast food."}
{"text":"Always yummy and healthy. I plan on making it as my diet;  just enough portion. Good food and excellent service!   Clean and organized;  always enjoy coming here, after my workout!   Way to go teriyaki boy,  yummy"}
{"text":"Great food! I come here all the time after the gym. Lots of healthy options. The food always taste great and seasoned well. My food always comes out fast as well. Employees are always great as well. Never had a bad experience"}
{"text":"It was okay. Kinda like Yoshinoya...Too pricey though."}
{"text":"Used to be 5 star and has definitely dropped in quality and customer service. The guy who is always at the register and makes the boba drinks is kind of rude and doesn't smile at all anymore. The meat has been poor quality recently as well. Didn't have this problem before, it's obvious the quality is cheaper."}
{"text":"We Order from here all the time and love the food. I can't get enough of their Spicy Korean BBQ bowl and the grilled egg rolls are just Awesome."}
{"text":"We ordered from grub hub for delivery and it was really good food and portions for the price! I will certainly be ordering from here again the pot stickers are amazing!"}
{"text":"Yummy Teriyaki bowls! Fast and friendly service! Thank you for being so fast & helping me get my boba tea!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Always good food no matter the option you pick. Yaki Soba bowls are the best and I am a big fan of the Thai Tea Boba smoothie! Definitely worth checking out.   ***They also have brown rice as an option, I saw someone post that they didn't a few months back and that's inaccurate!***"}
{"text":"First time here and the safe was really nice.  Food was really fast too and good Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Ordered through Uber eats...paid the extra for spicy on both bowls and extra veggies on one. No spice whatsoever in either bowl and the same amount of veggies in both bowls. The food overall was not horrible, but I probably wouldn't go again even if they had gotten my order correct."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I absolutely would. I ordered the steak and noodle bowl with crab Rangoon's. The steak tasted like dog food, the noodles were very cold. The Rangoon's were flavorless and doughey. I spent 11 dollars! Took one bite, threw it away and went to Popeyes. Pissed me off."}
{"text":"Love this place. Very fast and healthy food! Will definitely come back. One of the best teriyaki chicken that ever had. Thank you"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great food and good prices, especially the $3.99 special for the chicken teriyaki bowl.  Friendly, fast service...not much more you can ask for in a teriyaki chicken fast food restaurant.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Didn't feel like making dinner so my boyfriend suggested we get this. I'm usually not a huge fan of teriyaki but I figured I would try it after reading the reviews.   This location is clean and looks like they keep up with the maintenance. The reason I only gave it 3 stars was that the customer service wasn't as friendly as I like.   I got the firecracker chicken which was really good! The right amount of spice and sweetness. I wouldn't recommend if you don't like spicy food. I got it on top of mixed white and brown rice. My boyfriend got the Big Boy bowl. He at most of it so I'm assuming it was good. We also shared the crab puffs as an appetizer. Two things I liked were that I saw them cutting up real chicken breasts in the back and the crab puffs weren't fried. The flavors of the sauces were excellent! Food came out quick and hot.  I will definitely be coming back especially on nights I don't feel like cooking! Fairly inexpensive for us both to eat spent around $23 total."}
{"text":"Ordered through ubereats.  Was delivered fast. Opened the parcel. The vegetables weren't even completely cooked. Worst of all none of the fucking bowls had sauce on them. (2 bowls were mild and 1 was spicy)  So it was basically raw vegetables and dry ass meat on rice. Thanks if there was a 0 star option I'd take that instead. Never again.  When I spend 30+ dollars on food I expect it to at least taste decent. I ended up throwing all the shit in to the waste bin."}
{"text":"Ordered online and got an email confirmation, only to show up and be told they did not receive my order and were closing early (it was 8:30pm). Staff didn't seem to care so I sent an email via the website about my experience and never received a response! HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!"}
{"text":"This little shop is located semi conveniently off of the interstate and a shopping mall that I frequent for lunch during the work week.  Apparently Jay Cutler is the proprietor of this place as there are pictures of him doing bodybuilding poses above various menu items LOL.  I got the teriyaki chicken bowl which was the special for I believe 4 bucks. Had a couple small pieces of chicken and ample amount of rice and a few veggies mixed in there with teriyaki sauce on top. This place is definitely a better option than say McDonald's however you can tell that you are getting a $4 meal item.  If you're on the budget  this place could be friendly for your financial goals but moderate your expectations on the taste."}
{"text":"Yummy delicious food! Love coming here, wish they were open late so I could eat as soon as I come off of work! I prefer this location over the other near lvac, these folks over here have manners and just an overall good atmosphere. Korean bbq chicken is my total favorite!"}
{"text":"Ordered Uber Eats to be delivered to the park after my niece's soccer practice. Our nieces loved their teri chicken bowls. It was the most I had seen them eat in awhile. Ordered crab wontons and was disappointed that there were only three and it was delivered soggy and burnt. My husband, sister-in-law and myself all got the Jay Cutler steak bowls. The portion size was very generous but the steak flavor was just kind of blah. I also ordered it with some heat but it was just hot and again there was not much flavor at all. It also came with huge stalks of green onion which I'm not sure if people actually eat it but it was not appetizing at all to us. Probably wouldn't go here again unless it was for the kids to get teri chicken bowls."}
{"text":"If there is something that I hate with some restaurants... it is a business that nickel & dimes you.  Like charging $0.35 for chili powder.  Especially when the cute girl in front ordered something on the side and he says \"I'm supposed to charge you extra but I won't.\"  LOL  Food was tasty but this will be our first and last time here.  This probably explains why this place was empty at 12:30pm on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"I usually order chicken teriyaki bowl; white meat, add onions, sauce on the side and an order of potstickers. I  love their potstickers. You get 5 per order very tasty!Everything is always fresh and delicious and I feel the portions are a very good size. Know the chicken teriyaki bowl comes with dark meat. If you prefer white meat it is extra but minimal. If you are not familiar with their sauce I would recommend getting it on the side (they'll give you plenty of sauce on the side).  The service is always friendly and efficient whether I order via phone or in store."}
{"text":"Called to place an order for pick up was on hold for 10 mins you would think that they were busy or something I get there not doing squat smh worst place of business don't even know if I wanna eat here again"}
{"text":"I discovered this great place when a friend suggested it for lunch.  At the time I was a meat eater but have since become vegetarian.   It's one of the few places that I can get great Tofu and the staff is friendly which is always a plus.  The only reason for 4 stars is because some things are not always available."}
{"text":"My girlfriend is on a fitness challenge and we were looking for a healthy place to eat. This place is great, good portions and vegetables, brown rice, lots of protein. I got the yaki soba noodles with beef and chicken. The beef was well seasoned and the noodles were on point. I would come back again"}
{"text":"Good service. Usually asian foods get me bloated but this place did not. It felt like the food was very clean. The service was fast and good. I went two times during my stay in Vegas and would def return again."}
{"text":"Best teriyaki in the area. The firecracker chicken is really good too; has a nice kick. Oh, and the have boba tea, which pretty much guarantees I'll be back.. Every day.. :P"}
{"text":"Was meandering around looking for something to eat that wasn't to pricey.  Been in the parking lot of Teriyaki Boy more times than I can count, but never new it was there.  A quick little check of the Yelp found this little gem, and with a free order of pot stickers upon checking in; I could not make the walk from my car fast enough.  From the outside I thought the place was going to be bigger; as there is not much seating room and the tables are very close together.  I made my routine route around and through the bathroom before I order.  Place was super clean, very impressive.    Made my way to the menu and everything was well priced for the portion size.  I went with the \"Jay Cutler Bowl\" with steak and my free order of pot stickers.  The lady running the front counter was a little lost when I tried to use my check in, but the manager quickly rectified this small lapse.  Nicely done sir.    I took my seat and the atmosphere was nothing special, but nothing bad either. A few people walked in and left after eating their bowls, and mine was out in a reasonable amount of time.  Upon viewing my meal the bowl was a lot larger than I anticipated with loads of meat.  Very nice portions. The flavor was not bad but not amazing.  The soy sauce that came on the side increased it.  There is an option to have the sauce on top while prepared (Will defiantly try that next time).    All in all this is a great place for a healthier side of quick dinning.  Nothing off the charts, but again they are doing nothing wrong. The lack of flavor and small capacity to dine in will drop this rating a little, but I am not writing it off as I enjoyed my meal.  I will definitely be back to give it another try."}
{"text":"I ABSOLUTELY CRAVE this place!! I have my entire NY family and now all my friends only eating this!! The Jay Cutler is so delicious you just keep going back for more even when you can't eat anymore!!! For the first time since moving here I finally found a place I can say I enjoy eating at!! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Great place love the food it is definitely a place I recommend if you're near the area I always come never choose something else than this ship good the chicken seasame Korean anything is good"}
{"text":"Great place with tons of healthy options. I love that they have calories posted on the menu. Also, the employees seem to care wether you are happy or not. Prices are very reasonable for a good portion of food."}
{"text":"Located next to the Las Vegas Athletic Club. Teriyaki Boy is the best place to get a quick and easy post-workout meal. I ordered a large steak teriyaki bowl with brown rice and was quite satisfied with the amount of food.  I suggest checking it out if you need an affordable and healthy meal."}
{"text":"Sorry . Don't come here if you want them to open in time .  Business hours say 10am  I was here at 10:05 door was locked and the girl inside held up her hand and told me 5 more minutes. I won't be back .  Whatever your advertised business hours are ... you  should stick to them .  Alright - you have employees who arrived late or whatever - I'm fine with that . Open the door at least and offer me a place to sit down while you take the five or ten minutes it would take to get things up and running .  Poor customer relations . I'm out"}
{"text":"Love this place. Nice locator. Right next to the gym which makes for an easy and inexpensive post workout meal. Healthy and filling"}
{"text":"Ordered a Mongolian Beef, I think the chef forgot it's Mongolian coz it was more like Garlic Beef...every bite is a spoon full of garlic wtf??? I also ordered Steak n Chicken Yakisoba Bowl and when I got home to open the bowl only to find out, it's only got chicken n it's missing the steak.. Called to let them know about it but the person was rude and all she kept telling me was, I have to go back...no, not coming back for a while"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST pot stickers I've ever had. They are the absolute perfect little snack spot. Thru lychee boba smoothies are also what keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"Good service, terrible food. The teriyaki sauce is gross and so is their rice and chicken. Go to yogis teriyaki grill instead"}
{"text":"Very tummy teriyaki bowls!  The actual teriyaki sauce is so good! Ask for extra.  Vegetables are always cooked just right!"}
{"text":"Never again! Ordered a basic steak and chicken bowl with white meat and no veggies, add green onions. No kidding, the toughest steak I've ever had. Got tired of chewing, just spit it out. Ok fine, I'll just eat the chicken. Wrong! So dry not even edible. And the green onions, don't expect them chopped. There were big sticks of green onions folded in half. I'm giving 1 star for quick service and a friendly cashier."}
{"text":"This place is really good for quick on to go . It's fresh clean and healthy .. So far so good  my favorite is tofu yakisoba with vegys 4"}
{"text":"I've seen the place coming off the freeway, but never stopped in. Recently featured on Groupon so we took a shot and it's not bad at all. 4 stars because it's good, but not 5 stars cause it isn't something you've never had before. I do give it high points for effort and quality. Wife had the Mongolian Beef with Brown rice and I had the Yakisoba noodles with beef and chicken. Yep a solid 4 stars, nothing fancy about the dining room, but you can get powerade/fruit punch at the drink dispenser! They have ok potstickers and other Asian dishes so you aren't just limited to a few items. Will I be back again? Yeah, cause we have one more Groupon to use (ha ha!), but even after that is used up, I will drop by again. Sure beats a $1 burger and it's better for you in the long run! Oh yeah meals are served in plastic and not on plates as pictured whether you dine in or to go, I do hope they recycle their plastic containers, they seem to be of high quality and it would be a waste to have them go into the garbage. Maybe take the containers home if dining in and put them in the recycle bin? They need to open more locations, how about Horizon Ridge and Horizon in Henderson? (hint hint)"}
{"text":"I usually come in and get the Jay Cutler bowl. Have not been disappointed yet! I usually get it with extra veggies and steak.  Definitely a good place if you are looking for a quick bite and need to count your macros or are on some other nutrition counting plan!"}
{"text":"This place has healthy selections at a reasonable price and the customer service was great. The restroom was clean and the mango boba smoothie was delicious!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for the daily special and the teriyaki sauce is really good! Decent amount of food for the price!!"}
{"text":"Portions are pretty decent. Vegetarian menu is legit. I paid $7.68 for a tofu nugget bowl. Protein shakes are $4! And they have boba. Decent spot. Good lean food. Protein, veggies, carbs. Boom"}
{"text":"Gets better and better. I havent had anything that wasn't excellent. Teriyaki Boy kicks ass.  A full healthy meal at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"The obvious comparison here is to Teriyaki Madness. So how does it match up? Fairly well, I'd say. We had some groupons laying around for this place but it's reasonably priced so you don't really need such a deal to eat here. Much like Teriyaki Madness, they tout their high protein, brown rice meals (with the options of a low carb version). Add to that their association with Jay Cutler and it's no surprise you'll find them located near gyms. It's a great post workout meal-- you can replenish carbs if you're a a body builder or go for a meat and veggie meal if you are watching your weight. I've tried the chicken yakisoba meal as well as the mongolian beef. If you compare them to a sit down restaurant, then obviously the food wouldn't be much to right home about. But for a fast food establishment, they churn out some decent quality eats. The portions here are generous and should be enough to fill the appetite of any serious lifter. The yakisoba noodles are not overly soggy and come with a fair amount of tasty vegetables. The chicken is adequately prepared. Throw some sriracha sauce in their and you've got all you need. The mongolian beef is a pleasant surprise but also benefits significantly from some added sriracha. THe meat is plentiful and not overly tough. The veggies are a satisfying combination of mushrooms, green onions and green peppers. No complaints about the brown rice. The citrus chicken is also a nice way to go if you're more into the sweet side of the story.  I can't say this place is better than Teriyaki Madness but in my opinion they are just as good."}
{"text":"The food is good. I've been here a million times and never had a bad experience.   Today I was waiting on my order and a nasty woman came in angry that she called in an order and had to wait an extra 5 minutes for her food. (All the food here is made fresh and yes it does take a little bit of time.)She started recording the employee  claiming that she had a bad attitude. The woman at the register was never rude and did her best to stay calm. And I was very impressed at how she handled this poor excuse for a human. The woman should be ashamed of herself and her entitled behavior. And the employee should be rewarded."}
{"text":"Ordered a korean steak BBQ and a firecracker chicken for my boyfriend. Both absolutely loved it! Perfect taste. Clean store, good customer service. Keep it up."}
{"text":"They have the best steak teriyaki with the perfectly sweet sauce and their veggies taste AMAZING! it's so convenient because they have delivery through Grubhub! They also have phenomenal smoothies! I love love love the milk tea slush with boba! My friend always gets the lychee and we both tasted it and thought wow this tastes extremely fresh!!! Whether it is real lychees they use or not, it still did the trick! It tastes like the fruit itself! They have many other options like mango, cantaloupe, coconut, pineapple, you name it! Oh wait but back to the amazing teriyaki, I just want their sauce forever. My boyfriend gets the spiciest thing on there I forgot what it's called but he's inlove! This is definitely a fast and easy go to! They always have my order PERFECT when I have it delivered as well! :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant has excellent service. All of the food is fresh and delicious. They have awesome discounts and food is very affordable. Its located in a very convenient location next to lvac. Good service great food!"}
{"text":"As I'm looking at the menu, I see there's no rice choices!  White rice only!  I should have just left then. ( Healthy, shouldn't brown rice be a choice) IJS.   But I prefer, fried rice, yes, I know it's not a healthy option, but I would have liked brown rice instead of white.   I got the 1/2 and 1/2 chicken and steak.  The steak was chewy, So all I could do was pick out the steak. ughhhhh, I new I should have just gotten the all chicken.  The bowl was just a disappointment!  I won't be going back.  But check it out for yourself, it might be something you enjoy!"}
{"text":"Never been here before, I used a coupon from livingsocial. The place is really small but clean, has outdoor seating too. Food came out fast and as I expected, my kids like their food. The cashier was nice and friendly, she told me that they also have kids menu (which I didn't see on their board). I will be back for more."}
{"text":"Very healthy and affordable place to eat in the east side of vegas!!! I truly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This place is alright is you're looking for a healthier version of a teriyaki bowl. The sauce is really light and sometimes a little bland for me. When you order, they do ask a lot of question regarding how to prep your food. I think that's a plus if you're really trying to eat healthy. \"white meat or dark meat?\" \"sauce on the side?\" \"brown or white rice?\" If you're in the neighborhood, it's worth the stop."}
{"text":"I sat at the speaker to order and was told to hold on for 10 minutes i kept sayimg hello hello now here I am at the window for 8 more and employees have walked by 3 times ! Wow I'm now leaving to go else where amazing how ppl work. Bad place to go employees have no customer service skills. The lady comes out as I'm pulling away asking if I ordered. Bad service."}
{"text":"First time in this afternoon. Loved it ! Can't beat the chicken bowl special for that price . Super fresh just wish the carrots were a little softer . Will definitely be one of my new favorites !"}
{"text":"I ate here twice while in vegas last year during the Olympia weekend  . overall I was disappointed. food was lukewarm both times . I was realy excited to try this place since jay cutler endorsed  this place . I tried teriyaki madness and they were way better . if you guys want a better post workout meal go there instead."}
{"text":"Worst place for drive through they can never hear you because there sounds box sounds like crap and doesn't work another thing is that there whole exterior menu is all faded and worn."}
{"text":"I used to really like coming to Teriyaki Boy, but the last two visits have turned me off from using this as my go-to local teriyaki place. The rice is undercooked to the point of *many* individual grains being hard, and the counter staff acts like they are doing you a favor by deigning to serve you (mind you, they are only standing at a cash register). The Tuesday Thursday special *seems* like a good deal until you are disappointed one too many times by the entire experience. I'l gladly pay regular price for better food and service, sorry."}
{"text":"I love Teriyaki Boy! Especially its location since my sister and I just walk around the building after a nice long workout at LVAC Northwest. Plus the muscly, healthy, and fit photos of people on the walls of this restaurant are just so inspiring haha.  I was excited seeing this place since all food options were healthy. My sister and I shared a Large Teriyaki Bowl with brown rice and vegetables and it was so tasty and filling. I bought my boyfriend the Big Boy Bowl which had both steak and chicken breast on top of brown rice and vegetables as well which he loved as well. There are also dark meat or white meat and rice or no rice plates options which are cool since pricing is different for all options. Don't forget to get your free potstickers for checking in to yelp! They were delicious!  For our drink we shared a strawberry protein shake and strawberry boba. I recommend the protein shake but not the boba since it was so sweet and the boba was hard. =T  We will be coming to this place a lot in the future. =]"}
{"text":"I love Teriyaki Boys, Yaki Soba bowls are excellent. They have good service and the drive-thru is open late."}
{"text":"the food wasn't anything special, i got the chicken teriyaki bowl. i thought that the customer service was great, but the price was ways out of line! i would go here again, but I won't pay that price. i'll order something different. i love the mirrors that they have inside."}
{"text":"This has got to be my go to teriyaki boy. Every time I eat here I have no problems and the portions are pretty good as well. Overall awesome."}
{"text":"I tried the Mahi Mahi teriyaki bowl for the first time and really enjoyed it!! Well cooked fish and veggies with a flavorful sauce! I recommend it with brown rice!  Also service was easy and fast, if you are in a hurry and want food to go- this is the place!"}
{"text":"Love the firecracker chicken. Lots of variety and easy to walk over from the gym or trufusion."}
{"text":"Food is great but they definitely need new speaker in drive thru, freakin horrible or at least put a sign outside if speaker isn't working."}
{"text":"I was here earlier. I wish they were opened later! Really craving for the teriyaki bowl and the oriental salad the young lady at the cash register recommended. Great food, great service, food came out timely. Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Have to say this plays is the best healthy food in town love there customer service  We will come back again Thank you..........."}
{"text":"This food  is absolutely on point ! I absolutely  love it. The service is great and the place is clean and fresh! I love it and  will return often!"}
{"text":"The food is okay. Kinda pricey for its amount. The manager though is very friendly and accommodating... Place is small but enough, it has 8 tables. If you need any kind of special order you can ask the manager otherwise the staffs cant do it."}
{"text":"I love this place! You should try Mongolian plate! Excelent option, healthy food and fast service."}
{"text":"Great Healthy Food. I go there often for the yakisoba bowls. Try the Korean steak BBQ it's a great meal for post workout and doesn't weight you down."}
{"text":"Still closed and it's almost 1pm. They are supposed to open at 11am. Elizabeth smith came out and told her this happens often. Told her I was writing a review and said \"whatever\" sad that Jay Cutler promotes this place. They are supposedly having a meeting. I'm in the food and beverage industry. I'm sorry but meetings are conducted before or after business hours. I guess I'll go to teriyaki madness. They have better customer service."}
{"text":"Lunch special is such a great deal !! Good food & always fast great service. Teriyaki chicken bowl is my favorite but the potstickers are also really good"}
{"text":"We ordered from ubereats so I'm sure in the restaurant would be best, I've heard so many good things so I thought I'd give it a whirl..   Spicy Korean BBQ- I chose steak, super chewy, good flavor, ordered extra sauce on side and didn't need it, was not spicy enough even though I ordered it with more spice   Kung pao chicken bowl- super strong ginger flavor, just enough spice, good sauce to rice  ratio  Crab puffs = boring, chewy and pointless.. don't waste you money on them   I still want to try it in the restaurant sometime"}
{"text":"This Teriyaki Boy is conveniently located right next to the Las Vegas athletic club and between the nutrition rush on  the east side of the building to get your protein fix immediately after your workout it is moderately priced and there is a staff is of two but the food comes out at quick pace they sell delicious boba shakes and protein shakes there seating area is large and well spaced you   can't go wrong coming here"}
{"text":"One thing I can say about this place is that it's super slow. I've been waiting for 7 mins just for drinks. Good thing I didn't order food, this customer was waiting about 15 mins to just get his. The lady is never in the front to take orders and I believe they only have one cook. Prepare to wait to get a meal."}
{"text":"Chicken Low-Carb bowl is delicious! So is the baked tofu to have on the side! 1 lower star because customer service & professionalism definitely needs improvement!!!"}
{"text":"1st time at this location. Food is just as good as the rainbow location. Got the chicken teriyaki bowl with white meat. Perfectly cooked chicken & veggies. Everything tasted super fresh. Very affordable too. Also got the potstickers with the Yelp offer. Really delicious! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love their boba smoothies! The Thai tea smoothie was my favorite. Their steak and chicken bowl was really good. Also place was clean. Workers were really nice. Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Fried tofu bowl was tasty. I was disappointed to hear that they do not offer the Jay Cutler Bowl for the Tofu meat. Perhaps they can figure out a way to offer that in the future."}
{"text":"Love the food! Very reasonably priced! Great place for something healthy and fast. Highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Went there all the time and loved the food.  Now they have new people there who say they are closing when their hours are clearly posted online. They turn down service to close early. Amazing... I loved this please but I will never go back after that insult."}
{"text":"Terayaki boy is a great place to eat.  The food is fresh and flavorful.  Come here after the gym or on a busy work/school night and you won't be disappointed.  Love that they sell many varieties of sizes.  Love that they cook right in front of you.  The staff are quick and efficient, friendly too.   This will be my first time trying their boba, I'm sure it's great as it was highly recommended.   The service and food are great.  Like I said, go here and you won't be disappointed!  Manja manja!"}
{"text":"I get the everyday special.  Everything is expected, food is good, portion is great.  5 star review due to the fact that I was not underwhelmed.  Service is prompt.  They offer a \"jay Cutler bowl\", which is extra extra large if you are extra hungry."}
{"text":"I love the fact that you can get healthy delicious food here but damn that short girl at the front taking orders has an attitude problem. I ordered two jay cutler bowls and being a tourist to Vegas I asked what goes in it and she blasts off saying \"YOU JUST TOLD ME YOU WANTED IT OMG.\" I just wanted to know what goes in the food I'm ordering and i thought you worked here. Lol"}
{"text":"Saw this place on my way out of Albertson & was feeling for some Thai Tea Boba.   I'm giving it 3 stars cause the Thai Tea was yummy but the tapioca balls were NOT a hit."}
{"text":"Good is pretty good . But don't try calling for delivery or pick up order they WILL NEVER PICK UP THE PHONE  lol I've tried calling different times different days they just will never answer then I end up going there and it's not even busy I don't understand .other than that the food quality is pretty good .Its next to the gym , u frequent this place .I would recommend ."}
{"text":"I love my teriyaki \"Beef and Broccoli\" Yum!  I've eaten at this place a few times.  Very convenient, professional staff, and the food has always been good.  A few problems is the parking there is a disaster. I wish there was a larger portion per serving.   Over all its OK, but there are better places to eat."}
{"text":"First I would like to stay that this is the final time I will ever order from this dysfunctional and organize inconsiderate and ungrateful place. I gave them a opportunity to fix their mistakes not only once but twice!!! The first order was large and they left one teriyaki bowl out and we asked for plain Korean bowl which was hot and spice. The individual that order this was unable to eat it. That caused two people not to eat. They have failed to properly prepare food for delivery. They said the first time that they verified before the order left and blame it on Uber.  The second time they again didn't give me any assistance with delivering my food even though they admitted it was their fault. I suppose is slightly better than blaming it on Uber . I highly suggest that you never order food from this so called called restaurant or they will give you some sort of excuse. Either run a company that is functional or close down but don't make excuses!"}
{"text":"Having not been to this side of town before, I didn't know what to expect. I ordered the first thing I saw which was the beef yakisoba bowl. I've had yakisoba from other restaurants before and I had come with low expectations, but I was immensely disproven. It was quite possibly the best beef yakisoba bowl I've ever had!"}
{"text":"This is the best teriyaki place open! I love the sauce, the meat, the rice! Its all amazing! I get the Big Boy bowl! Nothing compares!"}
{"text":"First I always pass by this place after going to my gym (LVAC  215 av.) And today was the first time i walked in. The employees are verry nice and you order will be in your stomach in less than 5 minutes after your order.I WILL BE BACK !!!"}
{"text":"One more try.  Decided to give this place another shot since I was in the parking lot, hungry and wanted something quick before I passed out from malnutrition.  I got a steak bowl, no rice, all broccoli.  No I wasn't high, drunk or otherwise impaired, I just wasn't really in the mood for rice for some odd reason and had a hankering for some baby trees.    The meat is far improved from my initial visit many moons ago.  Instead of thin strips, I got small chunks.  Instead of brown, lifeless beef, I got a little char and a hint of pink.  The broccoli was cooked middle of the road - not too limp but with a little crunch to it.    I'm glad I gave Teriyaki Boy another go because it was much better than my previous experiences.  For that, they get another star."}
{"text":"We love coming here after a really good workout at the gym. It's perfect  size portions and really healthy."}
{"text":"Always enjoy this place because they provide good customer service as well as good deals when it come to prices. Also, I would recommend to he cutler bowl for a post workout meal because it's full of the good macros"}
{"text":"Unsatisfying and overpriced. Food was cold   and chewy as if sitting under a heat lamp and very small portions for the price. Pretty disgusting. Will not be back."}
{"text":"This review is based strictly on the a××hole cashier. The fiance LOVES the Hawaiian place next door, but they have NO vegetarian options, so I thought I'd try this place. I'd never been there, so I let the cashier know I'd need a minute. I was the only one in line. When he could clearly tell I was attempting to get his attention, he walked right in front of me, picked up a napkin, not making eye contact, and walked back to the kitchen. Finally he comes up and answers my questions as rude and degrading as possible, with a blatant attitude of \"&#%$ you\". Once the food was ready he came over with the bag, and instead of handing it to me, holds it two inches off the empty table in font of me,  and drops it, then proceeds to roll his eyes, without saying a word, and walks away. I was shocked.  I ordered a side of steamed veggies, which were AWESOME!!  Cooked with just the right amount of crispness and tasted very fresh. That is the ONLY reason for 2 stars."}
{"text":"Super fresh and very good portions. They are like real japenese teriyaki bowls. Had teriyaki chicken and there tfu nuggets are good for vegan option."}
{"text":"My go to teriykai spot - really good food, good prices, I eat here daily. 3.99 teriyaki bowl special and they have Boba smoothies! I highly recommend checking this place out if your looking for a good healthy cheap meal!"}
{"text":"When it comes to the three \"Teriyaki\" shops for healthy eating after working out at the nearby gyms whether it be Gold's or LVAC I feel Teriyaki boy beats out the rest.    There is nothing over $10 which makes everything nearly affordable and with the $7 for $14 Groupon it makes Teriyaki Boy very affordable.  I like the low carb chicken bowl because of the healthy chicken and veggie servings but that's being most effective when it comes to your health and post workout diet.    Bottom line, know there's a Groupon deal out there and take advantage of it.  The healthy options here I feel beats out the other two \"teriyaki\" places nearby.  I don't get the sauce at all or if I do I get it on the side and apply it myself."}
{"text":"I love this place! I get a good serving of rice veggies and my steak everytime I come and it tastes really good. Service is friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Need a stop for healthy food without spending a lot of $$? Look no further!! Located right on the corner of rainbow and warm springs for your convenience, this place is a stop for food with a large variety. They prep the food when you order, so I've noticed it does take about 10+ minutes to receive your food, but they're always super nice, and you get a lot!! They got chicken, steak, fish, veggie options, giving you some choices. Bonus, check in and you get a lil something with your order!"}
{"text":"Yum. Very healthy and fresh. The potstickers were delicious. My only complaint is that they are always out of white meat (chicken). Not sure what that is about. LOL  Wanted to update the review...I tried the boba here and it was terrible. Way undercooked. The service isn't too great either."}
{"text":"This place closes at 9:30 and I went in at 9:00p.  Came here to grab dinner to go. ALWAYS CHECK YOUR FOOD FOR TAKE OUT! Got two chicken bowls to go. Got our stuff but it was COLD. We asked them if they could do something about it. They cooked us some new chicken and we left.   Get home and one of the bowls had raw chicken! Pieces of the chicken are raw and sitting on top of the veggies and rice. That's totally unacceptable. I've never had this happen.   Now they're closed. I'm out the cost of two bowls. What am I to do? Wait until morning to talk to someone?   I get it. Places close. But who ever cut the chicken surely noticed.  They need to fix this! They need to have some quality control. Use a thermometer for the meat.  It's just a lose lose situation.  I ended up stir frying the veggies and chicken at home in a pan and nuking the rice.  I understand it was a 30 minutes until closing. They should have just told us they were unable to make any new chicken correctly for the night and sent us elsewhere.   I hope they get inspected.  I don't post bad reviews for the most part but I am doing so in hopes that no one gets sick.  I will not return but please be careful if you choose to."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced teriyaki bowls. They're going for health-conscious, so the meat, veggies, and rice are all pretty plain until you put the sauce on them.  The menu has a ton of stuff on it, but the bowls are all basically the same with a different sauce on top. I always keep TB in mind as a crowd pleaser: cheap, healthy (or not), and kid-friendly. The potstickers, noodles, and egg rolls are all pretty good, too."}
{"text":"I love teriyaki boy the food is superfood and at such an affordable price! I love grabbing my lunch from here especially the daily special because it's the right amount that fills me up, I don't leave extra and it's only like $3. It's also a very clean place and I love how helpful the staff is. Definitely a place I'd recommend to my friends and family. #healthy"}
{"text":"Been here about 10 times. I usually go to Samurai Sam's or Teriyaki Madness, but if I'm this area I go here.   My normal order: Large chicken bowl, extra meat, brown rice, and no veggies. Sometimes I mix it up and get the Cutler Bowl.   By the way, use to go to Bonzai Bobs all the time before they switched Teriyaki Bowl?  Don't be surprised if Cutler himself walks in here. I thought I ate a lot.   Smart how both Teriyaki Boys I go to are next to a LV Nutrition and LVAC.   I recommend this place, but wish they were open earlier."}
{"text":"Teriyaki Boy is one smart business.  Located smack in between LVAC and a nutrition store.  Where else do people from LVAC go for their post workout?  They should come here, especially since your anabolic window is about an hour after your workout.    I still remember when this location use to be Bonzai Bob's.  They have since shut their doors and Teriyaki Boy took over.  Teriyaki Boy still has the same line up and even supports ex-Mr. O Jay Cutler like Bonzai Bob's use to do.  I was a fan when it was Bonzai Bob's and a fan now even though it's changed to Teriyaki Boy.  I've tried their steaks, chicken, and salmon bowls.  Everything I've tried has tasted fresh and flavorful.  But it's their brown rice that tastes amazing.  If you come here and get a bowl, try it will brown rice.  For some reason, it brings the flavor out of their meats.  My most recent meal was their salmon wrap w/extra meat.  This was good, not as good as their steak or chicken bowls, but good enough to sustain me for a few hours.  All their meals are price low. The most expensive item on the menu is currently $9.40.  But keep in mind that these prices are for their larger.  If you got your big boy pants on or need that extra extra protein, go for the Cutler Bowl which is about 48 oz of food (over 12 oz of meat). It will cost additional to go huge on their meals, but well worth it.  Plus, it's perfect for the next day's packed lunch or baon (for all you Pinoys). For an even better deal, try their \"Weekly Meal Plan\".  This will save you about $2 on each bowl, but this also means the same meal all week long which can be boring.    To some, T-Boys is just another Teriyaki Madness or Samurai Sams.  Both taste and prices are similar.  But it's way more affordable than Greens & Protein when it comes to their chicken, steak, and salmon.  If you're hungry and looking for something on the healthier side, give T-Boys a try.  My suggestion...go big and get their Cutler Bowl.     PS:  There is a table reserved for Jay Cutler.  I didn't know who he was or how big of a deal he was until the day I was sitting in his chair.  Yes...he walked in and everyone gave me the look.  I got the \"you better get out of his seat\" type look.  This was a while back during the Bonzai Bob days, but they say he still frequents this place.  My advice, stay out of his seat!!!"}
{"text":"Came here last night just before they closed, literally 15 minutes prior, I'm HOOKED!!! It was very tasty, fresh and full of flavor.  A MUST Every time  in town."}
{"text":"I visited Teriyaki Boy for the first time recently after hearing people talk about their low carb bowls. I'm a low carber and it's so hard to find places around town that understand my lifestyle. When I walked in there were lots of big, beefy guys from the gym next door waiting to order big protein bowls -- always a good sign!   I ordered a shrimp low carb bowl with broccoli instead of rice. I loved that the cooks wok your food fresh to order right in front of you. The quality of the broccoli and shrimp was good too. I had two minor problems with this place -- one, the teriyaki sauce tasted really sweet, making me worry about too much added sugar; and two, the portion size was pretty small. I need to eat a LOT to get full since I don't eat carbs. When you start adding extra meat here and there, your meal price can quickly grow out of control.   I'd go back here but only if I was in the neighborhood and needed a quick, light meal. It's not something I'd crave and drive out of my way to eat. The restaurant was very clean and I had fast and friendly service. Parking can be a bit of an issue since there is a very busy gym right next door."}
{"text":"Each order comes with a healthy serving of rice but I think it's a little too much. Not complaining though since it's quite friendly on your wallet. Fast service and when I go there the guys are always really nice. I usually stick to the teriyaki chicken but there are plenty of other choices. I haven't tried any of their beverages but they do have boba or some protein shakes. It's very convenient after a workout and you need something that won't kill your macros. You can get the teriyaki sauce on the side and get extra veggies for a few cents more. Good quality for a cheap price."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what I was expecting. In Cali there was a chain of places called waba grill.. simple, healthy, cheap and really good. I figured a teriyaki bowl is a teriyaki bowl. I was wrong. I had my food delivered so I can't speak to the service but I can speak to presentation and taste. I ordered the tofu nugget bowl with brown rice and extra veggies. First of all why can't there just be simple grilled tofu? What is this mysterious nugget? Breaded outside with tofu and a random soy bean stuffed in it, not to mention no taste. My rice was dry and I received no extra veggies as I requested. I got a small amount of cabbage, some zucchini, 2 carrot slices and 1 piece of broccoli. I also was given a spice level option. I chose medium and let me tell you there was no hint of spice on that food. I had to get the bottle of sriracha out of the fridge and do it myself. Because of the lack of taste I added Tamari, which is just fancy soy sauce really. Nonetheless I was starving and ate the entire bowl after I doctored it up. I won't eat here again."}
{"text":"Fresh and clean tasting food at an affordable price! I enjoyed the broccoli and beef which had hardy chunks of just that. It laid on a bed of well prepared white rice and was lightly drizzled with sweet teriyaki sauce. The boba on the other hand was quite awful."}
{"text":"Best priced teriyaki bowl special I've seen in Vegas. Fast. Fresh. Healthy. It's in my neighborhood. Will keep coming back. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Ordered Mongolian beef at the drive-thru. I was disappointed that the sauce had no kick whatsoever--by the time I finished eating I had only the faintest sensation of heat. For some reason the food was so full of bell pepper seeds that it almost had a crunchy texture.  At least the food was properly cooked, so I might try some of the other dishes there."}
{"text":"Love this place it's close to the gym I go to but not only that the food is great ! For a quick bite to eat I always get the special they have teriyaki bowl"}
{"text":"Everything just tasted fresh and good. I ordered during dinner time and the wait for my order was kinda long even when I already placed it online 15 minutes early. But aside from that, everything was okay."}
{"text":"Perfect size brown rice broccoli bowl was sooo good.    Chicken and steak better than fast food places...   Plus the Customer service is amazing.  They member your name and bring it to your table.    PLEASE TIP THEM!!!    I'll be back"}
{"text":"Went there the other night and we got a chicken bowl and a chicken and broccoli bowl. The taste of the food was good. The portion of chicken to rice was very reasonable. The staff was very friendly. And price for the meals was good. What I didn't like was the presentation of the place. It was a bit messy, the tables had trays on them, rice all over, and chairs were all over the place. It wasn't even that busy someone could have cleaned the place up. I was happy they had drive thru, I will have to give the drive thru a try next time. Will be returning."}
{"text":"Tried UberEats, which was a good experience.   Ordered 3 different bowls from Teriyaki Boy, korean beef, chicken and steak and lastly a salad.  Prices were excellent and definitely worth a try, if I'm back for work to the area I'll surely try it again.    Steak wasn't of the best cut but I wasn't expecting premium pieces.  Ordering white meat chicken was definitely worth the extra .30 cents.  Really well cooked and not dry which is a constant issue at grilled chicken quick food joints.    Would have given 5 stars had the bowls had a few more veggies.  Both our bowls had cabbage and cucumbers.  no carrots or broccoli.  Would have preferred a little more variety and a tad less rice.  Was pretty tasty either way."}
{"text":"Come here with mY friends all the time. Love their food and great customer service!! Always recommend to anyone that visits Vegas."}
{"text":"To call this teriyaki bowl healthy is laughable. 80% rice, 20% meat and veggies. Even paid more for \"extra veggies.\" Also paid extra for \"extra spicy\" but everything was sweet and bland. Bowl was drenched in the sweetest teriyaki sauce I've ever tasted. Steak was subpar. Even the side of noodles was sweet. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"It's our first time ordering from this place, we ordered through uber eat, one chicken teryaki bowl and one wrap, while eating the wrap I found a big nasty hair inside it, I was so disgusted, will never order from here again, nasty food."}
{"text":"Great! Love the food there! They are always willing to give me extra sauce which I love."}
{"text":"Food is great...but service is soooooo slow! They need to hire another cook or a cook that can multitask.  Currently theres 10 of us waiting on some people been waiting for 30min for their food.  If you are on lunch break, you will be spending it waiting."}
{"text":"We always love coming here. The meal is great for those after work out sessions, or those who are tying to eat healthier. The place is always very nice, as well as the employees. And if you're lucky enough to catch them when they have their poke then you should give it a try! Portions are great, we always end up taking left overs home just because there is so much food! It does get somewhat busy here because they're right next to the gym but it's never been too packed that we cannot find anywhere to sit."}
{"text":"There is some irony in that they have the words \"healthy grill\" in their logo.  I found my beef bowl to be greasy.  The rice was soggy because of it.  This is a weird complaint, but their menu is too large.  It's confusing, there is just too much stuff.  They should focus on just doing a handful of items well instead of trying to do everything.  It took a long time for my food to come out, which may be one of the reasons it was soggy.  Anyways, Teriyaki Madness is better.  This place isn't \"terrible\", but I'd pick Teriyaki Madness over it any day of the week."}
{"text":"I ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl with extra teriyaki sauce (I love that stuff). If I were to rate the teriyaki sauce I would probably give it a one star. It's not sweet and it doesn't really have a nice taste to it. The chicken was thoroughly cooked but it doesn't taste like it was marinated in teriyaki sauce which it should be. I don't think I will ever come back here again being that teriyaki chicken is my favorite thing to eat and they pretty much messed it up. So 2 stars for me."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time coming here  We were in a bit of a hurry  And we told them it was to go They gave it to us in the tray  Then they forgot somthing Annd them when we get home  One of the potstickers looked like it had been bit we didnt even get a chance to go back cause we had to work.  The food is good but the people there dont seem to really care about there job."}
{"text":"I am a frequent patron of this particular Teriyaki Boy location as it is nearest to my home and usually has good food and good service. I visited Teriyaki Boy tonight around 7:35 pm (05/23/2018). While standing at the front counter, I watched the cook wipe the sweat from his forehead, then reached into the vegetables and placed them in the wok. WHAT THE HECK!!?????!! I could not believe what I had just witnessed. He did not even wipe the sweat on his pants. Just palm of hand to forehead, then leaned right over and grabbed the cucumbers with both hands. Eewwww.......Sure way to contract Hepatitis. So, I immediately informed the cashier of what I had just witnessed, and her response was \"Ok, I'm busy right now with customers.\" I am appalled. You would think that something so important would warrant a quick verbal with the employee to wash his hands, and to be mindful of his actions. But no, she just continued right on. So, as I sat and watched and waited disgustingly (for her to tell the cook to wash his hands), she said nothing. He continued to touch veggies and cook. :-( So, I said ma'am, this is a health hazard, and if you are not going to inform him, I will need to report this to your management, I then asked her for her name, as neither of them were wearing name tags, and she shook her head \"No\". She just refused to give me her name. She then replied, go ahead and do what you want to do. Can we say unprofessional! This was the first time I had ever been serviced by the young lady, and the first time I had ever seen this cook. So i'm assuming they have not been around very long, or maybe my timing has just always been right. So the moral to this story is, Teriyaki Boy Management, take notice. They are a potential loss to your establishment, a certain risk management issue, and the young lady, she totally brings down the sense of professionalism and good spirit that I am used to observing at this restaurant. She should treat all customers with respect and address any hazardous issues immediately."}
{"text":"Great food, great portions and always consistent! Love their noodles and combo meals! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Located right by the LVAC on eastern and the 215, this place is a nice quick healthy option for food whether it be right after your workout or just looking for some clean eats.  Service:  The service here is absolutely awful.  It really blows my mind how the cashier can stand there and treat me like a second class citizen and she gets paid for it.  I really hope the management sees this so something can be done about this.  ITS RUINING YOUR BUSINESS.  Green and protein is right there where the customers are treated well why would we want to go to you to be treated rudely?  Food: Being a broke college student, all i look for are cheap eats.  The $2.99 chicken bowl is the only reason why i come here.  The bowl is composed of dark chicken meat, white rice, broccoli and zucchini.  Vegetables and meat are fresh but that depends on when the meat is grilled and how recent the vegetables were cut.  I'd recommend adding sriracha to the bowl as well.  Overall: The food is good especially the rice bowl for the amount you pay, the freshness of the ingredients and the portion size but the service is sickening."}
{"text":"Been here like 5 times in the past 2 weeks. I absolutely love it! I've had the tofu nuggets with the yaki soba and they're my FAVORITE! The teriyaki sauce is bomb! Everything seems fresh, HEALTHY AND CLEAN! if you're watching your diet this is the place to go! :)"}
{"text":"This place is a great alternative to fast food. I had the chicken teriyaki bowl and it was simple and delicious . The teriyaki sauce is also a nice touch. I also tried the crab puffs which were okay. Overall a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Quite frankly, I'm disappointed. The only reason I'm giving a two star instead of one is because of a somewhat decent experience months ago. Definitely not the case for tonight...  I walked in and knew what I wanted - teriyaki. I was in somewhat of a rush so went with my usual of a teriyaki chicken bowl. I asked for brown rice and white chicken teriyaki bowl. This took about 10 minutes for it to be ready, and as I was already in a rush, I just grabbed my bag and left. Once I got home, much to my surprise, THERE WAS NO TERIYAKI FOR MY BOWL! It was not in the bowl. It was not in the bag. It did not fall out in my car. It literally was not added. I understand tapping a wrong button and giving me white rice instead of brown, but TERIYAKI is the first word in my order!   I can't say that I will never order from teriyaki bowl again, but I can certainly say that everyone should check their bag before leaving.    After leaving the review, I called to make sure I wasn't crazy and that teriyaki was supposed to be added. The lady on the phone said, yeah, it's supposed to be there. Didn't seem to give a care in the word that it wasn't."}
{"text":"Chicken very dry felt like I had to drink a half of liter of water to get it down   Portion size has decreased and they stopped giving a gym discount  Vegetables seemed undercooked and not good needed teriyaki sauce to eat them  Still trying to get this dry chicken down  The girl at the registered wasn't a pleasant person   I use to be a fan but has gone down hill, the extra distance drive to teriyaki madness will be much more worth it now"}
{"text":"i love teriyaki boy healthy grill! ever since they have opened im a regular at  this restaurant. its located right off the freeway and very convenient for me since i work out a lot at LVAC. from the moment that youve stepped out off the gym you will smell their grilled food from the parking lot they serve Real meat there not like the others which are like shaved meat for a sub sandwhich. i always have the best experience at Tboy. Fresh grilled chicken and good cut of trimmed steaks.and the vegetables are always fresh. i always quench my thirst with their Boba iced blended drinks. they are the best boba in las vegas compared to the ones at chinatown which takes cash only all the people there are so friendly and calls you a name basis. im very keen with bathrooms but theirs totally clean and sanitized.its a 5 star hotel bathroom feel there. over all i believe that this fast food health restaurant has great potential.cant wait to come back for more."}
{"text":"For me , they deserve 5 stars , i like eating there every time i go to vegas , as i like getting  my second meal while I'm traveling back to LA , it keeps me on track specially if i'm on diet .   Thank you very much guys ."}
{"text":"There was a technical difficulty upon the arrival but The chicken bowl special is the best post workout meal, money saving, & worth the wait! Not to mention the location is so convenient!!  Thank you Teriyaki Boy ;)"}
{"text":"Recently I've been on the look out for good Boba places and I was in the area looking for a cheap bite when I found Teriyaki Boy. It's ratings were decent and it's prices were low so I gave it a chance. The many pictures of food on the walls and signatures of weight lifters gave me hopes. These hopes however, were not lifted. The food hinted of an odd plasticky taste and the Boba was powdered with a flavor similar to extremely old and cheap strawberry candy that had sat in the halloween bowl. I was thoroughly disappointed and would recommend spending your hard earned money on Panda Express. I will not be coming back Teriyaki Boy."}
{"text":"So 1st time being here. I spoke with Diana she seemed very nice and helped me out witj my food order. Food is prepared very well. And Boba was delicious. I recommend coming here"}
{"text":"This place is really good & healthy!  The quality is very good yummy veggies & meats. The people are also very friendly & do their job above & beyond. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all with this location. I was on my way to UNLV from Henderson and stopped here at 11:45 on a weekday for lunch. This location opens at 11am!!! Not 12, not 11:45, 11....service is one of the most important aspects of a restaurant to me and I was disappointed. I tried to open the door and it was locked, a few minutes later a rude employee answered and told me they wouldn't be opening for awhile because they weren't done cooking and proceeded to shut the door in my face...? 45 minutes after opening? I didn't ask if the food was ready, I came in to order. Pretty sad since this is the location nearest me and I really like Teriyaki Boy but I will be only going to the Southwest location after this. Hope management can get this fixed!"}
{"text":"This location is great! Staff was super helpful and the food was really good for what it was. Love the menu options and I'm so excited for a healthy Asian fusion spot like this, will be becoming a regular!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl and the rice was horrible. It was either cooked way too long or there was too much water added when cooking it.  My girlfriend ordered a chicken and steak wrap but they only put chicken in there. She claims the rice was too sticky.  I ordered a thai tea smoothie and was skeptical about it. It was way too icy and I ended up wasting most of it. I would rate it a 6 out of 10 at best. The taste was mediocre.  I told the lady we wanted the wrap for here and my bowl to go but she did not listen and gave me my bowl uncovered with no top.  I remember the Eastern/215 location to be decent/good but this location on Bonanza is god-awful."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!!!!  come here all the time and I love how healthy it is!!! Love how the location is in the middle of everything so it's always convenient to come here and the food is very very very healthy!"}
{"text":"I've ate at this Teriyaki Boy location plenty of times but this last time was disappointed. Ordered Korean BBQ chicken, I get my dish and notice this isn't Korean BBQ (which I get every time I come) I go up to the cashier and tell her I believe they got the dish wrong, I even said this Korean BBQ typically has green onions and they're isn't any. She said they are out and it was the Korean BBQ. It wasn't a big deal I wasn't going to argue and figured I'll just eat it. I come back up moments later and ask if I can at least get some Korean BBQ sauce to put on it and she said they can not give out extra sauce, only what it is cooked with is allowed. I simply said okay and finished the meal. Given 2 stars rather than 1 because good past experience."}
{"text":"This location is terrible. Ordered the Cutler steak bowl.. I ask for white rice.. I get brown rice. I ask for sauce on the side.. they put the sauce on it. They threw full stalks of green onion on top without bothering to chop it up. The steak was very fatty and were chunky. My coworker got the chicken bowl and said the chicken was very dry. I've ate at all the TBoy locations and this is definitely the worst. Will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"They always mess up on your order. The white rice is sometimes hard and undercooked. Their meat has a lot of fat and is never cooked properly. The bobas are nasty. They have no flavor and a ton of sugar. When they first opened, their food was ok. Now it's horrible, it just seems as if they no longer care what they are serving."}
{"text":"The food is good, they are easy to find and parking usually isn't a problem. Recommend the chicken bowl with extra veggies,  brown rice and spicy. Goes well with a cantaloupe boba."}
{"text":"This is the spot after my lift! Good prices for some good food. You can get a 3.89$ bowl on Friday and Saturday.  Can't beat that deal for good food!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I really enjoy the yaki soba here. I enjoy stopping by after working out at lvac"}
{"text":"Ehhh, I was not impressed. The price for my bowl of noodles was almost ten dollars. The lady at the drive thru was a rude ass who obviously does not enjoy her job. The taste was ok but I did not get my moneys worth at all! Never going back!"}
{"text":"Very good teriyaki chicken, especially for the price. There bowl specials are a good fast alternative to other fast food chains. And service here was very good."}
{"text":"Horrible! Got a chicken wrap to go, it wasnt wrapped, the tortilla was hard, there was a whole so everything fell out. The veggies were all hard, not cooked all the way. Took 15 mins to get a wrap and a bowl, and neither was hot. Half the rice wasnt fully cooked either."}
{"text":"Overcooked, dry chicken and undercooked, stiff noodles, drenched in a syrupy sauce and mixed with tired, dry, flavorless vegetables for $9.45. Oh, and when I asked when the (currently closed) restrooms would be done being cleaned, I was told \"You can go in. We just left the signs up.\" Needless to say, I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place never lets me down. It feels you up with that good good.    You want to get those post workout macro nutrients in and fill your belly without feeling like a counterproductive piece of , then this is the spot for you!   I love the variety here, but my go to will always be that chicken or salmon brown rice bowl w/ broccoli. It never fails to impress and fulfill.   Come be about this life with me!"}
{"text":"Finally something healthy on the NE side of town. Always satisfied and stuffed."}
{"text":"So good! Great customer service and the food is too tasty. Get a protein shake if you're ever in the area. Best teriyaki boy around, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Everything here is good, so many bowl varieties! Good price. Friendly staff. Awesome service!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and go to the 99 cent store buy the box labeled \"Chinese Food\" - it will taste the same and you'll save some money. ... And it smells funny"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely awesome!! Best customer service I've had in a while. Kyle was incredibly helpful and kind. Had their teriyaki bowl, was delicious!!! I highly recommend them!!!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place at all. It's very convenient because it is in the same parking lot as my gym. I had high hopes the first time I went because the menu they have posted tells you how many ounces of protein you get. As a bodybuilder keeping track of that sort of thing that's important. I would buy my food, take it home and weigh it out for the day but there was NEVER the amount of chicken they said was in there. First time i figured it was a bad day. Happened the next day as well so I told them when I went in the next day. They made sure there was enough in there that day. Next time I went in? Right back down to less food than I paid for. Never went back again. Not going to have to police them to get what I'm paying for. The food itself tasted OK but not as good as other spots close by like Teriyaki Madness or Yummy Grill."}
{"text":"Man, I love teriyaki chicken. I think it should be a food group unto itself. It certainly would merit it in my case, as it's part of my food pyramid. For me, it goes (starting from the bottom): steak, burgers, pizza, teriyaki, sushi. That's the pyramid, and teriyaki is in a good spot, I think. Having said that, why just the three stars? Well...  Because this place is right outside the LVAC I (sometimes) go to, I only ever come here after a workout when I'm starving and don't feel like paying $7 for a smoothie. Every single time I've come in here, I've ordered the same thing: yaki soba with teriyaki beef and veggies, sauce on the side. I have no idea what anything else tastes like, but keep in mind I feel this makes me an expert on this particular dish. So this review is pretty much based on that one dish, plus the one time my brother said he ate there and he liked it.   Ultimately, it comes down to the noodles on this dish. The steak is almost always great, as are the veggies (but I hope you like a ton of broccoli and not enough anything else...) but the noodles are not the best. They always taste the way Panda Express chow mein tastes after I've left it sitting out for a few hours and then get back to it between episodes of Arrested Development. It doesn't taste fresh, but it's not that bad. It tastes like three stars. It tastes like \"I come here because it's the best choice without having to move my car\" or \"man I am starving and this is better than getting KFC on the way home.\"  While I come back? Certainly. I am a creature of habit and comfort, and both apply to this place."}
{"text":"Their portions are way off here I ordered a jay cutler bowl and got pure rice, they have to get some training from the bonanza location they're the best!"}
{"text":"Food was good, quick and the workers are courteous. Ask for extra spice for a kick of flavor."}
{"text":"Great food was really good and hit the spot after a good workout. Love the chicken and the sauce is crazy good. Thy also have wraps and salads that I'll have to try after this great meal."}
{"text":"This place has very fast service.  The food is hot and fresh and Healthy! Its so hard to find good food close to my house. The staff was friendly and very helpful.  Their Establishment was clean. Absolutely no complaints.  Definitely coming back! I got a chicken wrap with white chicken and brown rice.  It was splendid."}
{"text":"Loved it! Got delivery through grub hub and it was fast and food was hot. The meat quality was good. Got the Mongolian beef bowl and steak jay cutler bowl (body builder not football player). The Mongolian bowl was plenty, the jay cutler bowl was huge and my BF barely finished it. The vegetables were really good and you didn't get mostly veggies and no meat, it was a legit ratio. I added spicy sauce and it actually had a kick which is love. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Low quality food, needs to be managed better!  Owners should enhance the quality for the pricing they expect.  Not coming back here ever...."}
{"text":"Always satisfying after a great workout ! Great staff great food! On top of that they have boba tea inside ! Come in and get your self a boba and some awesome food! I work in the restaurant industry and couldn't be happier with the hospitality here !"}
{"text":"The food itself was ok but beware ordering on the Yelp Eat app, I paid extra for brown rice on the salmon bowl and got white rice and at the store they asked me \"sauce on it or on the side?\" And I said \"on the side please\" and I guess they put it WAY on the side because there was none in my bag, at all. Went to Teriyaki Boy, they forgot the Teriyaki."}
{"text":"So the other night..I came back to this place and order the dark meat chicken rice bowl...this time i order the regular size and not the kids....Can you say awesome? Lots and lots of veggies for this palate! :) The amount of meat wasn't quite enough but I will be upgrading the next time i am in the area.  :) PS: they even give out a card for regulars to get something free after like 8-10 purchases! Now that's a deal!"}
{"text":"Its ok i really dont thinknit lives up to the hype ... Yeah id come again but looks and sounds better then it is not saying its bad .. It just aint nothing real special..."}
{"text":"After a good work out, my body screams for protein! This place is within walking distance, right next door to LVAC!  A lot of healthy options here, and CHICKEN FOR DAYS.  We ordered 2 Teriyaki bowls that were ONLY $3.89 EACH!!  Really cheap, and the portions were pretty big considering the price! I even ended up ordering a third bowl!!  If you just finished working out and looking for a quick protein meal, here's your place!  Could use a friendlier staff though.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"it was our first time here, so we ordered online to pick up. when we got there my order was not ready yet. we waited about 30mins for our food. good thing we checked the bag because it wasn't complete. we ordered extra salmon but didn't received it. so we waited about 10mins again.  I ordered the steak bowl, NOT SPICY but what i got was SO spicy!!!!!! i didn't even finish the food..... and the salmon was dry...."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome they actually allow you to kinda make your own bowl if you dont want something set off the menu. I always get the Korean steak with the yakisoba noodles, the steak is to die for. And what keeps me coming back is the fact i get free pot stickers with check-in honestly thats a smart move. The only thing id change is to have the veggies a little more cooked, but hey it is called healthy boy for a reason lol"}
{"text":"Eh.  Not that great, but definitely not the worst in town."}
{"text":"Come in regularly and get the jay cutler bowl. $13 and a massive portion that will stuff you and leave you with a snack for later  good value and portions. Thai tea with boba was not as expected as someone put caramel in it. Not sure if it was a one time mistake or that how they make it. It was still delicious but I wouldn't call it Thai tea. The blueberry muffin protein shake was tasty but came off more like a light and fluffy milkshake than a protein shake.  Overall good food, good value, and good service. A must try for anyone nearby."}
{"text":"If I could give them no stars, I would. I placed an order through uber eats. They didn't have any salmon, so the uber driver called me to inform and I changed my order. When the order came, it was short one of the items. I called the restaurant and they admitted it was their fault. They said they would contact me back in just a few minutes because they were calling uber for another pickup. I never heard from them again. I tried to contact the restaurant multiple times. The calls go to a voicemail with no answering machine. They didn't credit me and I didn't get my food. Beware of this place. I'll never go there again"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Located in a large shopping center but had a surprisingly short wait time. Would dine at again."}
{"text":"I really like the food however i believe they are severely understaffed.   The guy at the register works fast but i just walked in to order a boba smoothie and he told me unfortunately he couldn't guarantee me a timely DRINK...It would be a 15 minute wait for...a drink... then he showed me a used blender pitcher awaiting to be cleaned... why is there only one pitcher for smoothies? Whenever i order a boba it's am inconvenience to the cashier it's rediculous and sad get your stores together!"}
{"text":"Ordered from here after a recommendation from some people in Keyser, WV.   Excellent food! Healthy too!"}
{"text":"So I do like this place I get sweet and sour bowl I LOVE pineapples so 2 weeks ago they were out I'm here 2weeks later they are STILL out!!! Order some damn pineapples already lol"}
{"text":"Great service was greeted by Kyle and Alex as soon as my family walked in for lunch.We tried there 3.99 chicken bowls and it was pretty good.Also the store was very clean and well kept.We definitely will be going back.Thanks guys for great service"}
{"text":"Wanted to grab something fulfilling but inexpensive, so I decided to try this place out. The menu was very easy to understand and the cashier was extremely helpful in providing information about what was their most popular dishes and plates were. Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with their welcoming service and food!"}
{"text":"first time and and the daily special teriyaki bowl is so  good. I would come back anytime im in the area"}
{"text":"Soooo bad! My husband and I order this for the first time through uber eats app. The crab puffs that I ordered where so over cooked there was no crab meet or filling left in the middle. I got the sweet and sour shrimp bowl with brown rice and spicy and the rice was undercooked and not spicy at all. My husband order the salmon bowl with brown rice spicy and got white rice, it wasn't spicy and the salmon was not fresh. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Teriyaki Boy  on South Rainbow s my new favorite healthy Chinese takeout or eat in  restaurant. Awesome food and awesome service!"}
{"text":"$3.89 after tax for a teriyaki chicken bowl with veggies? Yes, it can be done. Not sure how they do it, but, I hope the magic never ends."}
{"text":"Before I came to Las Vegas I was worried about finding anything healthy to eat, that is, until I discovered this little gem. A Japanese food restaurant with a healthy spin on it?!  Vegas -really does- have it all!   --   Sometimes, when you see the word \"healthy\" slapped on anything, it can mean dull/boring food with no flavor... but that's not the case when it comes to Teriyaki Boy: Healthy Grill.   Not only does their food taste good, but it also LOOKS good too. They use fresh vegetables, grilled chicken, lean cuts of meat, with low-fat sauces, and they don't cover their food in tons of fatty oil or batter. And their food doesn't look boring -- the food presentation is quite nice. In fact, I was shocked at how great their Yakisoba Bowl tasted and looked.  (Not to mention the fact that their Yakisoba noodles are made out of wheat!)  I noticed that they also have gyouza on their menu, but I didn't try it.  The reason is because I know that gyouza tastes the best when its deep fried, and crunchy, but that's by no means healthy. So I was surprised to see it on the menu at all.  But in all honesty, to me their gyouza looked a bit soggy from the picture, so I didn't order it. Perhaps next time I will.  I thought the prices were reasonable and the service is friendly and fast. They even remember your name and bring the food out to your table.  How many other fast food restaurants do this?  Not many. And even fewer can claim that their food is healthy. So that says a lot.  The interior of the restaurant is small, but not cramped. I also like how they have pictures of all of their popular menu items up on the walls so you can see them. The restroom is SPOTLESSLY clean. I thought that I was in a fancy hotel restroom. I was honestly impressed.  Now, for all of you people who are saying that their food \"needs a little more flavor\" (you know who you are), you are wrong. Your taste-buds needs to learn to eat healthy food, and pass on going to McDonald's a little more often. After eating junk food for many years, you have to re-acquire a taste for healthy food. And this right here, is your opportunity. Bon appetit.  To sum things up, in my honest professional opinion, this place is awesome.  I love Teriyaki Boy Healthy Grill. And I would most certainly come back here if and when I pass through Las Vegas again."}
{"text":"Bueno bonito and barato describes this place. Its good cheap and nice ha! great prices compared to other places and they serve a good amount. I always try to order ahead because they are usually busy and takes a while to get food."}
{"text":"It was my first time to go there and it is a bad experience.I went there at the drive thru I waited for how many minutes 'cause there's a car in front of me then when im already next,the guy just smiled at me and told me that they are already close then they should have told me earlier and close the open sign.It's a waste of time."}
{"text":"I've ordered from them 3 times each time has been really great. The tofu the tofu nuggets the salad even the salmon, which honestly given how cheap it was I was worried about ordering but it's phenomenal! Not fishy at all , so good! And the Thai tea boba frozen drink was amazing too! Really low prices , fast service ,great food. What more could anyone ask for ? Fantastic. I hope they never change."}
{"text":"Just had the firecracker chicken. Was so good! I love spicy and this was just perfect! My fav now!"}
{"text":"After being on hold for 10 minutes trying to place an order for pick up the employee just hung up the phone so I walk in and tell her I was the one she just hung up on and she said \"sorry we are busy\" and rolled her eyes. I turn around and their is one customer in the restaurant. Won't be going back"}
{"text":"Fast service at a good price for a healthy meal.   If you are on a diet and need a place to go to while cutting or bulking. Their price is pretty fair for what you want."}
{"text":"get the jay cutler bowl.  This place has really good food and they are fast.  nice little fast casual off the strip."}
{"text":"I ordered them for the first time today... said lets try something new. I ordered spicy steak and added extra steak with veggies...  So excited I take a big bite and it taste completely like fish. The meat was over cooked and dry as well.  Now i understand you have different protein options but there is defiantly a cross contamination.    Very upset and disappointed.   Hopefully this doesn't happen to anyone else if they have a allergen issue like myself.."}
{"text":"I love this place! health and delicious!  one of my favorite spots during lunch time!"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot, very clean and fast service. The cashier was very nice and friendly & quick to tell me of the fun perks. Amazing teriyaki for not too much cash, lunch on a pinch went well today for me. I would definitely recommend to a friend"}
{"text":"Boooooo!!! We placed our order through Bite Squad (which we love), and have had really good luck with the restaurants thru them so far. Today's lunch was terrible!! Even though we requested extra teriyaki sauce, each of the bowls came with two measly little cups with about a teaspoon of teriyaki each. That would have still been ok if the food had some flavor. Really dry and really bland. None of our appetizers (pot stickers, crab rangoon, etc) came with any sort of dipping sauce, and they were bland too. Bummer- won't be ordering from there again! Now I have two teenage boys I STILL have to figure out lunch for, even though we just bought $75 worth of food from them..."}
{"text":"I went for the first time today and I was not disappointed. Very healthy alternative to other fast food. I liked there teriyaki bowls but think that if you do not add more teriyaki sauce it can be a little plain. Overall, great experience and I will come again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My husband got the chicken teriyaki bowl, I got the low carb chicken teriyaki bowl and the salad. With my meal, it was divided into two meals and I was beyond full. I can't wait to have it tomorrow for lunch. 100% ordering again from this place!!"}
{"text":"The best teriyaki bowl in town! Great food at a good price. Friendly staff and clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Healthy food that is tasty! I loved their steak wraps, veggie noodles and chicken bowl.  They grill the meat right there for you to see.  I also had the Oreo cookie protein shake and I am now hooked! I love this place. I didn't feel bloated after, lots of fresh veggies and grilled meats.   I am now hooked! Did I mention the prices are very affordable!"}
{"text":"One of the only healthy restaurants with reasonable prices,good for lunch and dinner or snack wraps on the go."}
{"text":"Do not eat here if you are a fatty or a foodie. You are surrounded by beefy guys and tiny women in so little clothing even a stripper would ask them to cover up. Definitely the gym rat type of place.   Music? I liked it, typical pop, but blasting so loud that they should install a disco ball. You have to scream to have a conversation. The workers can't hear over it, either,  and thus screw up your order. Plus, they will stand at the counter and yell \"ma'am\" over and over until someone standing close enough to hear them will come get you. Never mind that they could have simply taken the three steps over to hand it to you.   I'm dying laughing at all the people calling this place healthy. I'd call it healthy-esque, at best. You really have to be on your toes to keep it clean. The teriyaki sauce is pure sugar, and they only offer \"lite\" soy sauce, no low sodium or gluten free. Noodles and rice? Really? Boba in artificial flavors so sweet it'll make your heart race. I had to throw mine away. Ask for sauces on the side, then babysit the cook. She'll give you none at all, then when you ask for it - again - on the side, she'll splort half a cup of it all over your food!   Something they do do right: veggies. Those saying the vegetables were undercooked apparently don't know what veggies are supposed to taste like. These were perfect.   The place is roomy and clean. Food is ok. I make better at home, frankly. Service not so ok. Wish I knew about the low carb options before ordering. Of course, it would make for a very dry meat dish, since the sauces aren't anything a low carber could touch.   I am both a fatty and a foodie, and I threw away 2/3 of my meal. The sugar rush made me ill."}
{"text":"Feel good food just like home cooking.  Tender meat and fresh veggies. Free potstickers were a bonus treat. Lookin to come back for more steak!"}
{"text":"I love coming here! I always order the Beef Jay Cutler bowl. It comes with tons of food and they have awesome service!"}
{"text":"Best teriyaki chicken bowls quick service very clean eating area sauces are readily available menu is very easy to follow the food is overall very good and healthy"}
{"text":"Very good food. The soba noodle bowl was great. Lots of fresh veggies (only got 3 shrimp in the bowl). I also love that they grill their eggrolls. I would eat here again for sure for the simple fact it's a quick healthy choice."}
{"text":"I like the food selection they have here especially the protein plates they have which go well after a good workout.  Today i came in to get a milk tea Boba($4.50) but unfortunately they did not have it available, had to go with a straw berry flavor.   I'm not gonna lie, I'm kind of bummed out since I really had my heart set on the milk tea, it was actually the only reason I came in today.   Regardless, I do come in to Teriyaki boy for their food as well since it's pretty good.  By the way this review is for the location on Rainbow close to Lake Mead Boulevard right next to the LVAC."}
{"text":"The good is fine, but the service is always fair to poor. I would write more but what is the point. If your hungry and are close not a bad meal. Would I go out of my way to est here, nope."}
{"text":"Great local place. Food is great. Don't pass on this place! You must try it! You'll love it!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Brianna was very helpful in helping me decide what to get. Food tastes amazing and the location is very convenient. :)"}
{"text":"Nice curb appeal. Inside is nice with lots of seating. Menu is very easy to read. Lots of good healthy choices. The teriyaki sauce is supper yummy. I will return.."}
{"text":"First time at this little place...loved it! Hubs got the chicken and steak teriyaki bowl and I got the sesame asian salad. Yummers!!! I've been a little sick and still can't taste fully, cannot wait to be well and have the salad again with full flavor buds!! Highly recommend this place if you want a healthier option."}
{"text":"I've visited Teriyaki Boy's East side location, but when I noticed that there was a location right by Joel's work I was excited. This location is located right by the LVAC so the parking lot is always full. Beware on where you park! Some spots due to traffic make it difficult to back out.   We walked in and immediately noticed it was pretty packed. It's a small space to begin with. Since I knew exactly what to we wanted I placed my order. I got a bit of an attitude from the girl that rang us up. Like she was bothered that we were there. I just smiled and said \"thank you\" and grabbed our cups. Joel and I both ordered the chicken and steak Yaki Soba bowls. Normally I love their food! I've even recreated it at home, but today the noodles tasted burnt and I had pieces of the core of the cabbage that tasted off. ( The cabbage is normally my fav part of the dish.) It was very disappointing. Joel finished his food and by this time I was ready to go. I didn't want to waste my food and figured Joel might want it even if it had a burnt taste. On our way out I waited in line to ask for a lid for my bowl. There was only one person in front of me and the girl that was ringing her up looks at me and says\"Can I help you with something?\" (In a very snotty tone.) I asked for a lid and was happy to get out of there.    Needless to say I will not be returning to this location any time soon. The staff is rude and the food just isn't as good as it's been at their East side location. Too bad! They are in serious need of a staff switch up! Beware!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place on my way to my Dad's house. They had me at healthy and teriyaki!   What a menu! They have rice, soba noodles and all kinds of meats and fish to pick from. I ordered the chicken and steak soba bowl. I also ordered their edanama and an egg roll. The soba bowl came filled with chicken and steak. It also had loads of veggies which made me extra happy. I love their teriyaki sauce cause it isn't as sweet as traditional sauces. The egg roll was tasty and grilled instead of fried. I also liked the bowl of steamed edanama.   They really do live up to their name. They have healthy food that tastes amazing and for affordable prices. I wish they had one in my neck of the woods."}
{"text":"Had teriyaki for the second time in two days. This time at Teriyaki Boy just around the corner from Teriyaki Madness. It was surprisingly similar to the T-Madness product and just as tasty. The place was clean and the food came out quickly."}
{"text":"COMPLETELY GOT MY ORDER WRONG!!!!! I asked for brown rice along with many other things that you checklist on Uber eats and they messed the ENTIRE ORDER UP. Super annoyed . There's also no number to call it just a rings and goes to voicemail. Food was very bland and gross steer clear of this Bs food joint"}
{"text":"Get your $2.99 bowls on tuesdays and thursdays. I defintely take advantage of that deal on a weekly basis. hehe overall experience with this place.. I can't complain. I normally get the all white meat teriyaki chicken bowl. it's about 8 bucks for a bowl and it comes with veggies and rice you have the option to choose brown rice. Customer service is great everyone is greeted and they are polite. I am a regular at this place if im craving for something healthy and quick."}
{"text":"With so many restaurants to choose from and why would you go through these reviews and still order from an an establishment  that is obviously inconsistent as hell. Why take the chance?  I ordered our meal with brown rice in the two of the bowls. Nope. I ordered mine to be extra spicy. Nope. I ordered utensils to eat with. Nope. I did to the fact that my husband bit into his chicken and spat  it out after it popped in his mouth a big chunk of gristle that was all slimy and filled with God knows what. I had take it to him  with one of our own forks I had because they refused to give us the utensils which was a major hassle and inconvenience. I actually took my bowl back and had to go through a big run around just to get a refund through bite squad. Seriously guys,  this place really sucks ass and with places like teriyaki madness out there that are consistent and awesome,   just don't take the chance it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Let's start with customer service A+ Next the food, The food was fucking amazing moist juicy I got the Jay Cutler bowl, this shit was huge!! I love it this is my favorite place now a must, 2 times a week maybe 3! I got my bowl with brown rice 12 ounces of steak garlic green onions and smooth teriyaki sauce this was love at first sight for me LOL I recommend to everyone"}
{"text":"I have eaten her 2x so far...  Ordered the chicken teriyaki and then the mongolian beef along withe pot stickers....  Both times the food was bland and tasteless,,, I did not like what i ordered both times...  Seems that they pre-make the meats and put the sauce on top before its delivered to the customer...  I think this is why the meats are rather bland..  I have had better at the malls....  I will not be back here... Maybe you guys will have a different opinion.... Located in a small anex next to the LVAC on Eastern... Hope this yelps..."}
{"text":"Love the tofu nuggets. Great run in and grab delicious lunch. Fresh and tasty!  Order ahead. The wait can be long for lunch..."}
{"text":"Great and very friendly people behind the counter and on the grill. Food always tastes fresh .Jay Cutler steak bowl is my favorite thing to order off their menu. I'm there at least three times per week and will keep coming back. Conveniently located inside the Albertsons shopping center on Rainbow and Warm Springs."}
{"text":"I tried the mahi mahi bowl for the first time and I was really disappointed. There wasn't much meat and veggies, and they filled most of the bowl with white rice."}
{"text":"First time having it was better than expected recommend to any one specially cuz it's on the healthy side lol"}
{"text":"One of the best teriyaki bowls I've had! Not only that but they serve you a large amount with tons of meat! At great prices too! And the teriyaki sauce is the bomb! Food tastes fresh!"}
{"text":"Pretty much you get what you pay for. I wasn't happy with the shimp teriyaki bowl I got. Teriyaki sauce seemed watered down, shrimp was very tough & chewy. Couldn't finish the bowl cause I really didn't enjoy the flavor so I left some for my roommate, but after I started getting a serious stomache ache I just threw it away."}
{"text":"I pick up for uber/and my self alot. Very good food and great customer service. Will reconditioned for anyone looking for great food along with service"}
{"text":"It was really good... a little expensive around 10.00 just for a plate of food no drink included. The food was good though and filling. Not enough for left overs but enough to be full for awhile.... sense it's right by the gym you might be really hungry and which case you might want to add one with some extra things but I will most likely try it again. Nice service, they seemed a bit tired but they where friendly. Pretty loud inside. I would have liked more veggies. Over all a-ok."}
{"text":"The staff is really nice and friendly. I love the prices here and the white chicken bowls are tasty as well. I've also used uber eats to order here and it's always been tasty and so so filling. One chicken bowl can last a while. Uber eats is a great way to order from them to avoid the drive! I recommend coming here to all my friends!"}
{"text":"Great place to get noodles!  The food is always fresh and tasty. It is my favorite place to get teriyaki bowls!  I have never had a bad dish here and the egg rolls are grilled, not fried. This is the only place I have ever had them that way."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  Fresh food and they will make it any way you like it. I always ask for it well done, suace on the side and No carrots. They serve it with a smile. Yummy too!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I don't usually go for teriyaki bowls, as the prices are usually too high.  We happened to drop by on a Thursday afternoon, and found out that If you go on Tuesday or Thursday they have the regular bowl for just $2.99.  It's just the basic bowl, but it's yummy and a good portion.  They served the sauce on the side, so you can decide how much you want to use.  The vegetables are fresh and not overcooked.  I will be back again soon!!"}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill!!!! Brown rice undercooked ... Soda machine wasn't working bathroom had no paper towels... Told the girl she said oh well! Then my noddles were not even cooked and she said well that's him the guy who cooked them .. He said hold on I'm watching soccer! Great Customer service! Done with them... Stay away!!"}
{"text":"The guy behind the counter was so sweet and friendly. He gave great service and the food was wonderful. I especially love the Thai tea smoothie. Great restaurant, will be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is a must try. Got the teriyaki chicken bowl daily special. Liked it so much that I didn't leave a grain of rice or veggie. The vegetables they came with compliment the main meat. If you feel like you need more teriyaki sauce, you are free to go to the side counter where there are bottles of it. Looking forward for another meal."}
{"text":"First and possibly last time I ever eat here... Umm tip, CHECK YOUR CHICKEN. In a rush, I came in for the first time to teriyaki boy right after working out at LVAC. I asked for dark chicken, w rice n veggies.  Order came up rather quickly.. BONUS points right? Upon looking at the chicken further, I'm noticing it wasn't grilled or anything, just looks like plain chicken. Then I'm thinking, did they microwave this, how did they cook it? Chicken came to me a little pale looking rather cooked... I take my first bite, not bad... Upon completing half the bowl I notice a few pieces that were not cooked... I brought it to their attention, they asked if I wanted something else. I said \"no\" due to the fact they might give me more undercooked/microwaves chicken...   I'm betting that if I DIDN'T ask for sauce on the did I wouldn't have noticed it... So for future reference CHECK your chicken..."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, def recommend it to anyone...must stop if I'm Vegas...Jay Cutler bowl for sure...fits a BB budget..."}
{"text":"Love this place , food is great and service is fast. Very healthy and portions are decently fair. Keep your health in mind while enjoying  great food!"}
{"text":"I ordered the fire cracker chicken with extra veggies and the chicken was nice and juicy. The veggies were cooked perfectly and they were nice big chucks of zucchini, which I love! Most places, the zucchini is cut thin and falls apart because it's cooked too long. Not here though! Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"This is one of our regular \"go to\" for a last minute dinner decision. Always good food, and quick service. We always place an order to go and have never actually sat down to eat there. My regular order is teriyaki chicken (white meat) over rice in a bowl. It has never failed me. My boyfriend switches it up and hasn't complained yet. And if you check in on yelp, currently offering an order of potstickers for free. Check them out!"}
{"text":"3.99 for a chicken bowl, what a deal! Definitely recommended for those coming from a good pump at the gym."}
{"text":"This is the only place I eat at when I'm in the east side of Vegas ! , it's always a good day when you step into Teriyaki Boy !"}
{"text":"I think the only thing really keeping this place afloat is its location. It is in a VERY busy center with an LVAC and 24 hour Starbucks. I never experienced rude service, but it was never very good service either. The two girls working here always seemed kind of unhappy, but unlike some people, I don't generally expect someone making minimum wage to kiss my ass.   The food is ok. They charge you extra for everything so the menu price isn't accurate. If you want white meat and brown rice it's extra. The total cost for a chicken bowl is around $10. My biggest issue with this place is that like some other reviewers, on more than one occasion I have received chicken that seemed under cooked or at least very borderline! So that is pretty unnerving. Pretty stingy on the veggies too. It's mostly all zucchini!  I have since ditched this place for Teriyaki Madness on Maryland. It's a little further drive for me, but it's slightly cheaper, usually faster, and tastes better too."}
{"text":"We came on a Friday night and order 1. Yakisoba steak and chicken LRG 7.60 2. Low carb chicken bowl LRG 7.30 for $2.11 (used the $7 groupon for $14)  - Next to YogurtLand and LVAC.  - Chicken was underwhelming. Can't expect much for dry white chicken breast. - Steak was slightly flavored and probably the best item on our plate.  - Average tasting teriyaki sauce. Not far off from Kikkoman teriyaki marinade. - Yakisoba noodles like microwave Maruchan style chow mein.  - Steamed vegetables is a great alternative over white rice.  - Honestly, I'd opt for Teriyaki Madness to satifying my Teriyaki taste buds.  - And for my money, I'd rather eat a grilled chicken salad.  - But to stay fit, I wouldn't mind the occasional healthy meal at Teriyaki Boy."}
{"text":"We ordered taro Boba tea which was delicious and icy cold. The boba balls was nice and squishy. Great dessert after eating Asian foods."}
{"text":"Teriyaki Boy Healthy Grill is a fantastic place to eat! They are clean, they have excellent customer service, and the food tastes delicious. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to a friend. Also, is the best cashier ever."}
{"text":"Sweet chili chicken bowel was good. Free order of pot stickers. The place is very clean and great customer service."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price , better then other franchises (Teriyaki Madness) that over charge for simple cooked food."}
{"text":"The food wasn't awful but the rice was mushy as hell. I ordered extra meat but if that was extra, I'd hate to see what normally came with it"}
{"text":"After reading some of the poor reviews we were not going to try teriyaki Boy.  I am glad we did give a try, the food was good, the staff was friendly and they were quick!  They use all white meet and the food taste good and fresh.  We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good. Goooooooooooooooooooooooooood."}
{"text":"This place is my go to place when I don't have time to meal prep. It's actually healthy and delicious. You can ask for the sauce on the side. I would usually pick up chicken and steak for the week here. 10-13 meals would only be be $100-$130/week."}
{"text":"Love it here. Close to home. Can sit out side and eat! Everyday special is great deal"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to eat.. The egg rolls are the best I've ever had.. Firecracker chicken is amazing!! Also the jay cutler bowl is pretty good if your really Hungry."}
{"text":"Gotta get my boba issue.. definitely recommend this location... Customer service is great and quality food!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place out after searching for different teriyaki bowls in town. Finally decided on this place. Drove 10 minutes from my place to only find out they closed.  Yelp said they closed at 10. But I guess 930 is 10 to them. Kind of bs if you're gonna advertise closing in 30 & arrive at your destination 30 min before closing and they're closed just makes it not worth going to or even given the time of day."}
{"text":"Stephanie was very nice and helped us pick out a healthy dinner. Teriyaki chicken bowl was amazing and so was the Korean chicken. Customer service is amazing and prices are affordable. Great dinner after a workout at LVAC."}
{"text":"The customer service here is horrible.4 people after me that ordered had received there food before I did.I ordered my food at 2:13pm didn't receive it till 2:36pm."}
{"text":"Love the food! Excellent customer service skills. Highly recommend this place. Check out their daily special. It's a healthy bowl of teriyaki with white rice and steamed vegetables. You can never go wrong. Especially when the price is right!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to try Teriyaki Boy for the first time.  First off the cleanliness was poor, the service was extremely poor, and they literally copied everything from Bonzai Bobs Teriyaki Grill which use to be the best teriyaki place in town. They copied the menu, the actual teriyaki sauce, and the Jay Cutler bowl.  Needless to say I figured since I'm there I will give them a try, I ordered to go and when I get home after about 3 bites there is a 4\" black hair in my bowl.  Completely lost my appetite and at that point decided I will never eat there nor suggest this place.  Sucks that even with attempting to copy Bonzai Bobs they did an unbelievably disgraceful job."}
{"text":"chicken/steak yakisoba bowl is delish! tai tea boba is thick like a slushy and not so watered down like other places. potstickers were a little hard but still tasty, and free with checkin :)"}
{"text":"Dinner... Firecracker chicken bowl... Delicious & healthy..... So not turning on my stove this summer!!!"}
{"text":"The rice was hard and the workers was slow. I was very disappointed with my meal and won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat after a good workout, the veggies were grilled to perfection and my brown rice wasn't crunchy. There was also a nice portion of chicken in my poem as well as teriyaki sauce."}
{"text":"You guys are slacking! I ordered my 3rd time through grubhub and I order kung pao with brown rice , extra veggies and half shrimp and chicken. I got white rice , chicken and just broccoli. I might as well order from anyone if I can't get what I actually asked for."}
{"text":"Service was good. The bowl was pathetic. The first time I went, I got a 2.99 bowl which was great. This time I bought a $10 bowl. There was (I counted) 1 quarter sized piece of carrot, 1 .50 sized piece of cabbage, 7 pieces of broccoli, 7 pieces of zucchini, 6 pieces of steak and 5 pieces of white meat chicken. The rest of the 32oz. Bowl is rice. I'm so disappointed. The only reason for 2 stars is because the first bowl was good and the service was nice."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their $2.99 teriyaki bowl. It had enough rice, veggies and chicken (dark).  The boba tea was blah. Would not recommend it at all.  But for a cheap, quick semi-healthy lunch I give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"My favorite teriyaki joint in this area.  Much much better than Samurai Sam's, Teriyaki Madness, and Teriwoki.  All of the chicken and steak is grilled really well, and the veggies are cooked perfectly.  I love how the sauce is not that sweet.  Normally I don't have any sauce or very little, but I loved this sauce so much I found myself putting on extra.  I had the chicken and steak combo, with extra vegetation plus brown rice.  It was so much food I had enough for two other meals.  Will definitely come back, I just hate the location next to Las Vegas Athletic Club, because it is so crowded."}
{"text":"The food is good... But the cashier's are loud and say plenty off profanity in front of the people eating inside there restaurant.  The food is great but maybe they should get new workers."}
{"text":"Me and my coworker got Taro drinks, and honestly they were bad. They probably used enough ice for two drinks but only taro-powder for one. Super water down. For $4.50 each, they can afford doing it right.  Meal-wise, it wasn't bad but the rice was cooked with too much water."}
{"text":"I was looking for something different and new to eat and saw this pop on yelp.  I had not had a good teriyaki chicken bowl in a long time and it sounded like a great option.    I found the regular size bowl to be just enough to fill me up.  I couldn't imagine ordering the larger size.  The chicken was perfectly cooked and the veggies were great just enough crisp in them.  I loved the fact that they gave me two little cups of the sauce to add as needed.  I used both!  I thought the sauce tasted great, good mix of sweet and salt.  I will agree location is annoying because of being near LVAC.  I came at lunch time and was hard to find a parking spot.  Otherwise, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Daily special is the best. Great food, great price. Their service is amazing. Their drive thru is quick."}
{"text":"Dropped by Teriyaki Boy in search of some quick, clean protein.  The b/f says this is where Jay Cutler has his own bowl, and sure enough, there's a picture of the former Mr. Olympia on the counter and his own big teriyaki chicken bowl--buff!  We only wanted plain chicken breast with no sauce, no rice, and some plain broccoli and the folks behind the counter were very accommodating; this location is right next to LVAC, so they're probably used to such requests.  If you're into eating clean, which can mean boring at times, this place can hook you up.  It's also super clean as an eating establishment--the employees were mopping and cleaning when we walked in and kept on after they served us.  They have boba on the menu, too, but it's not on our diet these days; too bad, so sad for us."}
{"text":"These guys are always helpful and awesome. They offer a special bowl on fridays and Saturday's and its the perfect post-workout meal. Definitely recommend the teriyaki sauce on top. Located right next to lvac on Cheyenne, right off the freeway."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant several times and last night was awful. First off the workers do not speak English. They messed up my order and then made me feel guilty because they had already started what I didn't order. I agreed to take it and it cost me more $$ than what I originally wanted. The won tons were super greasy and undercooked. When I called to complain and asked for a manager they told me no manager was there and hung up on me. I tried calling back and the phone was off the hook. Worst customer service ever. Save yourself the frustration, don't eat there."}
{"text":"If your looking for a quick place to grab a quick bite, within walking distance from your stay at the Courtyard, then Id try this Healthy eating Teriyaki grill. There Chicken and Steak bowls are fresh and pretty good, my steak was a little on the skimpy side, but the portions I did receive made me want more. Steak was very tender and cooked perfectly. Not sure if its a chain or individual franchise, but hope they stick around and prosper in this competitive Eating fast food wars."}
{"text":"Screw this place. I order a Korean steak Bbq and when I got it, it didn't look like steak so I asked the guy if this was the Korean steak and he said \"yes\" so I thought to myself ok maybe they changed it up a little. So when I got home guess what it wasn't the Korean steak it was the Korean chicken. I go this place all the time and I'm frustrated like all hell that they screwed it up. Don't know if I will go back again. Stupid people sometimes"}
{"text":"Teriyaki Boy's chicken teriyaki bowl was delicious and the staff was very friendly. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a post workout meal."}
{"text":"Went here after work on 12/28/11 because I was craving some spicy pad thai, but there's not a place to grab that around Anthem, so I ended up here. I asked for whatever was spiciest, and the girl behind the counter suggested the Fire Chicken (I think that's what it was called.) It came out to a little over $7 which is w/e. I loaded it up with Sriracha. It was good, and it was moderately spicy, but I think I can make some better stir fry over noodles for cheaper."}
{"text":"Teriyaki Boy Healthy Grill has a good variety of chicken, steak, and seafood bowls that definitely satisfy your hunger.   Unlike most Asian fast food places, they offer good generous servings of rice or yakisoba, which I appreciate. I also love the flavor of their Green Tea smoothies with boba in it! Delish. Another thing, one time I had their steak yakisoba and the steak was super tender, it was awesome. I've also had their shrimp teriyaki bowl, which was good as well. Their food definitely tastes great.  The reason I only give them three stars is because for a fast good spot, this place takes such a long time to complete orders. We ended up turning off our car while in the drive-thru one time."}
{"text":"Food is really good. Calling ahead and having it ready when picked up is a huge help.   great flavor, great prep. Amazing portions. All around a great place to get a bite."}
{"text":"Best clean eating in Vegas. I've been coming to Vegas for work for several years and this always a regular stop for me while I'm here. I try something different every time and it's on point every single time. Keep it up guys!!!"}
{"text":"This was a nice find food was really good flavorful and Spicy! Potsickers were delish and yummy"}
{"text":"My low carb bowl, which I paid extra for extra veggies in, was comprised of about 9 slices of dry chicken atop a mound of zucchini and two little sprigs of broccoli. Now, there was an option in my order to pay a premium (less than a dollar) for all broccoli. I assumed since that was an option that my bowl would have at least some variety in the types of veggies in the bowl, some cabbage and carrots and maybe some onions or something. Nope, a bowl of chicken and zucchini. The sauces were very good, however, and the potstickers. That being said, if you don't want to pay nearly 10 dollars for a bowl of zucchini, go elsewhere or pay extra for the broccoli."}
{"text":"I love their bowls. It's a healthy alternative and close to Starbucks for when I study!"}
{"text":"I go here after the gym. Usually its a fine experience, but today I just got back to work to find out that my chicken and steak bowl was only chicken. I'm sure it was an honest mistake, but c'mon I paid for the chicken and steak and wanted that. I'm absolutely willing to change my review to 5 stars if management is proactive with this mistake."}
{"text":"*free potstickers (5) with yelp check-in today*  Went today 10-30-15 at noon for lunch take-out.  I ordered online and then paid when I got there. It took me 9 minutes to get there and the cashier said she *just* got my order.  So plan accordingly.    $17.94 got me a mahi-mahi teriyaki bowl and two smoothies.  When I got back to work and opened up the teriyaki bowl I noticed that the mahi-mahi looked and tasted a whooooooole lot like salmon.  Something fishy is going on here.  *snickers*    I enjoyed my first taro smoothie today!  It's pretty good...reminds me a lot of Ube ice cream.  The boba at the bottom were hot...I think they just cooked them.    The teriyaki bowl was meh.  Tasted really healthy.  If I was watching what I eat this would probably taste wonderful but as a fatty it was very....meh.  I got bored and depressed halfway through it and put it in the fridge \"for later\" which is code word for \"I feel guilty putting this in the trash so I'll put it in the fridge and then throw it away when it starts growing fur.\"    Very nutritious and I'd definitely go back here if I ever went on a diet or if Jay Cutler invited me.  One time I went to the BX on Nellis AFB and Jay was there signing autographs.  I got his autograph and took my picture with him.  He was kind of a jerk.  He didn't look at me or say anything he just posed for the picture and then turned back around.  Now I understand why he was so sad...because he has to eat food like this every day.  I bet if you fed him chili cheese fries he'd be nicer."}
{"text":"Delicious and healthy!  I love that they are next door to yogurtland also!  I eat here when ever I can!"}
{"text":"Why have open signs and be open on Yelp until 10:30 if you're closed by 10:10? Drove here for nothing. I guess it can't be that good if they are closing so early. Major thumbs down."}
{"text":"The only taste i got out of my korean bbq bowl was garlic. Kung pao chicken bowl, hard dry chicken, flavorless Wouldn't recommend this location... bad experience for me"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend love this place!!! The food is delicious here. In glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I used to go to teriyaki madness but this is now my preference. They have an everyday special teriyaki chicken bowl for $3.59. They also have a small selection of protein shakes, I have tried two so far. They employees are very patient and professional. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Always yummy!! Close to the office and never disappoints! I love the Taro Boba smoothie and always get a regular chicken teriyaki bowl-- yum!! It's right next to the nutrition store so it's convenient to get some Quest Bars for an afternoon snack :)"}
{"text":"Its pretty good. I would give between 3-4 since I cannot give half stars. I used to go here for lunch during work. Its one of those types places. Best to order and go. Lots of gyms types in here. Not only is the food tasty but it IS healthy.  I have had the yaki soba (sp) A type of noodle that tastes grilled ( its wonderful). I either get it all veggie or with chicken. These noodles are yummy.  I have also had the salad a few times. They put light noodles in there as well. The salad is really good and filling, you get a good amount, and it is fresh. I am a salad snob, so believe me when I say they have a decent one.    I have had the boba smoothies many times. I have had the watermelon and the honeydew. Fantastic I have had them blended both times,  I suggest it this way.  They have a diy drink bar, and they also have fruity  green tea as an alternative. I love when places offer green tea!   The chicken is fresh, it always smells great when you walk in, and there are many things to choose from.  I suggest this place for lunch, or a movie and a dinner type night."}
{"text":"Teriyaki boy is amazing ! Their good is always fresh , their service is always on point , and they  have great prices ! Also the deals they have are like no one else's, check them out !"}
{"text":"Teriyaki Boy is one of my favorite after workout diners. Chicken , Steak, brown or white rice or even all veggies if you're on that serious kick the carbs to the curb diet. Add a protein shake and its your one stop shop to gains gains gains. They'll even make up a weeks worth of meals in various forms...Sweet. Grab a workout and don't forget that post meal grub at Teriyaki Boy it's fast, easy and you're out the door. I mean come on its where Jay Cutler eats, how can you go wrong with that. He just gets grumpy when your at his table.lol."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this restaurant, after reading multiple articles about how great a health place Teriyaki Boy is. The staff here were very friendly, welcoming, and fast. I hoped to see better drink options than soda but oh well. I got my order of firecracker chicken bowl to go and was anxious to try it as the smell filled the car on the way home. Unfortunately, when I got to try it the chicken was meh. The broccoli was undercooked, the zucchini overcooked, and there was about a 4th of a cup of water at the bottom of the bowl sloshing around and making the dish all together soggy."}
{"text":"Fast and healthy.. but could use a better front staff. Not too friendly and not rude either.   The guy in the kitchen was always nice. The female staff is nice..  Just saying.."}
{"text":"Great service, employees are always very attentive. They have the best teriyaki bowls I've had in vegas! I've eaten here a few times, just never gotten around to leave a review. Their potstickers are really good too! You get a lot of food for what you pay for. Great value. And they also deliver through Uber so you can order from home. :) They also have delicious boba smoothies, protein shakes, wraps, and salads. Check them out!"}
{"text":"I love Teriyaki Boy , it keeps me on my diet whenever I don't have time to cook or I'm on the road .  Very clean and healthy food"}
{"text":"Ordered a tofu bowl (only comes in one size) it was mostly rice and just a few pieces of raw cabbage and carrots. I also order pot stickers...they were okay besides the bottoms being burnt. Bummed out because I heard this place was amazing."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes based upon the reviews but.......customer service does not exist.  Stopped by after the gym to order some healthy food for the family.  Ordered 2 low carb chicken bowls with sauce on the side and the hubby ordered a steak bowl.  Waited almost 30 minutes for our ToGo order but was entertained by the young girls at the counter giggling and playing around between orders.  There was no adult supervision in the house. Got our order home and it was not right.  Both low carb bowls had salmon instead of chicken and no sauce on the side.....in fact, no sauce to be seen, including on my hubby's steak bowl.  If I wanted dry smelly fish on over cooked vegetables with no sauce, I would've cooked at home! Sooooo.....I call the restaurant and ask to speak to a manager.  I was told by one of the giggly girls that the manager is not there and they can do nothing about our problem. She took my name and number and would have the manager call me.  After several days, called \"Dry Smelly Boy Healthy Grill\" back to find out why the manager had not called back. Was told that the manager was at a different location and she would remind her to call me.   I waited 2 weeks hoping they would make it right but no go. So beware of this place.....I wasted $16 on food I had to throw away. Check your order before you leave!"}
{"text":"If you're craving some teriyaki flavors, I do recommend this place.  There's nothing quick about it, as it seems to take a long time for them to prepare each dish.  I don't mind the wait as long as the food is good.  Plus, this is a cook to order place, nothing sitting under warmers.  You'll notice a lot of healthy freaks will come here and I think it's because they do offer some healthier options.  They have brown rice, good cuts of meats and decent pricing for their quality of food.  This is a big plus for them.    I was given an entertainment book as a gift, so I downloaded my app and just showed them the deal for a $7 discount for 2 plates of food.    I recommend the Jay Cutler bowl, with a good serving of green onions and super tender beef.  Another option is to get a chicken bowl and nix the sauce.  I always ask for light sauce, they inevitable ruin it for me, so now I just ask for no sauce.  They are definitely heavy handed on the teriyaki and hot sauces, so just add it on yourself.    Oddly enough, they even offer boba drinks here.  I guess if you're not into protein shakes, you can always go for boba.    3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Went there around 12 on a Thursday.  Not much of a wait.  Small sitting area inside so I got it to go.  Huge portions.  I got the Cutler Bowl.  So big I finished the rest for dinner, still good as a left over.  Chicken was a little bland, but juicy and fresh.  Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Trying this place out my girl lives the food here, place is very clean and food smells bomb"}
{"text":"Food is good but they have HORRIBLE service!!! Rude, got my order wrong, and wanted to charge me extra for a mistake they did."}
{"text":"Perfect for after LVAC workout meal. Lots of peeps wearing workout attire and gym shoes here. Parking is decent, but getting out of it can be a challenge dependingon the time of day.  Clean, reasonably priced and convenient makes this a good spot for a quick bite on the go. The menu is pretty straight forward, but I prefer anything else but their yakisoba noodles, which I found to be rather bland tasting.  Beef is better than their Chicken, which is still pretty good. Wrap is preferred over their Rice, both of which are way better than their Yakisoba.  Staff was friendly and greets you as you enter and leave the premise. It is such a trivial thing, but makes a big difference.  Good job!"}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly fast and on point! If you are looking for a quick healthy post workout meal this is the spot !!"}
{"text":"Ive been going here at least 3 or 4 times a week for the last few months and have been overall satisfied until today. I JUST ordered a Korean BBQ bowl with extra steak and since the cook was too lazy to make more steak, they decided to give me chicken along with the regular serving of steak and act like i wasnt going to notice. This is unacceptable and sheer laziness"}
{"text":"I always come here when I'm in Vegas. Teriyaki Boy's food is great if you are health conscious and want a delicious, hearty meal. Their desert options are quite good too, offering boba and protein shakes."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! My husband and I claimed this to be our quick fix for dinner options!!"}
{"text":"If you are a business that  mostly sells food with rice wouldn't it make sense to not run out of rice?   I come in here because its convenient to the gym but honestly, the service is slow, the bathrooms are dirty and the portions seem to be based on the mood of the cook...   Im over this place....."}
{"text":"Driving around looking for a quick lunch on the cheap.   I skim my Entertainment book and decide to get a bowl from Teriyaki Boy. There are quite a few bowl options and flavors. I noticed they even have tofu, which I might check out the next time I stop by. On this occasion I ordered the garlic chicken and broccoli over brown rice. The sauce was a little lacking, it definitely needed a little more flavor and the chicken was really dry. Not a fan of that, but overall the meal was ok.  I will try the place out again if I'm in the area and happen upon another coupon. The prices didn't seem too bad for the quantity you get, I'll just stay away from the chicken next time and take a few more sauces and condiments with me on the side if I take the food to go."}
{"text":"Placed an order through uber eats and the restaurant forgot one of the meals I had ordered. When I called the restaurant and informed the woman who answered the phone that a portion of my order hadn't been received, she promptly told me that she wouldn't look up my order without and order number... but I hadn't been provided an order number. I do know the restaurant took my credit card and charged it so she should have been able to look the order up that way. She seemed extremely rude, maybe she was busy but she certainly made no effort to help me. She didn't say \"could you hold please?\" to try and sort things. Her attitude was like \"fuck you customer\" and passed the buck onto uber. On top of that, my order wasn't correct. I didn't receive the right items with the meals I did receive... go figure. I eat a lot of takeout but none of it will be from here in the future."}
{"text":"Very convenient, professional staff, and the food has always been good.   Some problems is that parking is a disaster. It's a little bit hard to park in this lot, but it's doable.  Know that the chicken teriyaki bowl comes with dark meat. If you prefer white meat, it is extra but not too much more. If you are not familiar with your sauce, I recommend that you place it on the side (they will give you a lot of sauce on the side).   The service is always friendly and efficient whether you order by phone or in the store. When I order from here, it's usually takeout so that I am able to get in and out.  In general, it's fine, but there are better places to eat. However, if you're looking for a quick chicken and noodle or rice bowl, this is the place to go to!"}
