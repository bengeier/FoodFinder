{"text":"Horrible service!!!

This place may look nice inside, but the service sucks big time.. I waited for 1 hour for my chicken wrap and when I asked where is my order I got attitude from the old lady in the kitchen. People were getting their orders that came after me. I left without even offering a refund. Never going back."}
{"text":"Hannah's is a cute lil gem that brightens up the high park/bloor area.

Living close, there are few options for a cafe with good coffee, delicious food and a low key atmosphere. Hannah's makes up for that and is definitely one of the better options for anyone going to the park or passing by.

A bit pricy but you're paying for what you get so if you don't mind then it's worth it."}
{"text":"Place has an nice interior. Food is pretty good, however staff is awful. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"We came to Hannah's after a long day of walking through High Park and were left with a very \"meh\" attitude.  

I ordered the breakfast sandwich which was $6.75 and was intending to share it with my SO, but the sandwich was extremely small. However, I saw a breakfast wrap come out and it looked pretty big so maybe that ones alright. My other friends ordered one of their wraps and they gave it a 3/5.

The cashier at the counter was fairly nice but our server wasn't as great. 

The decor was really nice and cute and there's also a seating area outside where you can enjoy your meal/coffee if the weathers nice. 

The sandwich itself was okay, nothing amazing, we were just extremely bummed about the portion. 3/5."}
{"text":"It's a beautiful cafe but unfortunately service is hardly a one star. I asked the server for a spoon while waiting in line she simply looked at me and kept doing what she was doing without replying. Then when my boyfriend asked for the spoon again she said she was busy doing something. I think the place should be managed better. Too bad for the service specially that it's a charming space."}
{"text":"Nice place. Bad staff. 

The interior is great and the patio has a nice view of high park. The staff is lost and a quite rude unfortunately."}
{"text":"Hannah's is a great little neighborhood cafe with friendly staff and tasty food. A few others have complained about portion size vs. price. If you want McDonald's, go to McDonald's. Hannah's serves quality food made fresh right behind the counter. The breakfast parfaits and various chicken sandwiches are always tasty. I bring my laptop and work from here every couple of weeks - they're always cool about that, too."}
{"text":"Amazing spot, wonderful and not an overloaded decor on the inside. Have only taken things for takeout so far, I cannot wait to have a sit down inside the actual caf√©. 

Have only tried the brownies so far (with sea salt Caramel)... They. Are. Heavenly!"}
{"text":"The cafe is right across high park so you have a great view when you are at the cafe. It has a beautiful interior design and a patio which is great for studying or working. Their menu is a little on the pricey side when it comes to their food. The breakfast sandwich was very small for its price and the chicken wrap did not have a lot of flavour."}
{"text":"I just went here for the first time (I'm a High Park area resident) to pick up a latte and an egg white breakfast wrap. THERE WAS A BEETLE IN MY WRAP. I am not joking. I enjoyed the first half, took a large bite of the second half, and saw something WRIGGLING in among the spinach leaves. I regret that I was too shocked and disgusted to take a picture (I spit out my bite and threw out the whole thing immediately) but WTF, HANNAH'S CAFE, WHERE ARE YOUR FOOD SAFETY PROTOCOLS AT????"}
{"text":"Chicken and yam w/ veg wrap was good. Awkward service."}
{"text":"A really great European style cafe right in front of High Park! A come here when I go for a walk in Toronto's most beautiful park. Great coffees, beautiful atmosphere! The only reason I won't give 5 stars is because the service was not as friendly or attentive as I would have liked. No one was at the cash or serving drinks when I entered, a customer had to flag a staff member down to serve me. Minus that little hiccup, this has the potential to be 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I finally checked this place out today. Service was good, nice selection, prices were fair. The atmosphere was really nice, easy to find a seat and just relax. The portions of the cakes were really nice. 

I would recommend this place and would go back."}
{"text":"Hannah's is a beautiful addition to the high park area! 

It's such a cozy and quiet cafe with great service. I stopped in for a chai latte and apple cream cheese square - delicious! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Cosy and comfortable prices are good, staff and food were great. Would recommend to anyone in the neighbourhood. Had a great time. 
Thank you"}
{"text":"A lovely cafe right besides high park Morden decor and friendly staff Hot chocolate was around 4 bucks but it tasted normal"}
{"text":"A few days ago, my friends and I went on an \"aesthetics\" day, which is an inside joke about going to places that are really pretty and taking good pictures. After high park, Hannah's is on the north side and very close to Keele subway station. We saw the pictures of the interior and it was definitely on our list. 

I really hate giving low ratings, but Hannah's was a disappointment. The inside is awesome and beautiful and very hipster, but the prices and the portions are high. I also found that they need some blinds or something, especially since summer is coming up. They have really huge windows and I was burning when I was sitting inside. 

We ordered the breakfast sandwich, which was $7. Outta whack dude. It was a good sandwich with obviously better ingredients than McDonald's, but I could get a very similar sandwich at starbucks for $3-4. It was also tiny af. I also found the coffee portions to be small. I ordered a medium for $3 and it was similar to a small at other places. Coffee is obviously a strong point of their business, but I was not really blown out of the water. We also had a service issue where my friend was given the chicken wrap but it did not look like any chicken was in it at all. We thoroughly inspected it before we sent it back, and a few minutes after she came back with a new (maybe, not sure) one and said that it was just the way it was cut and there was indeed chicken in there. Eh. Alrighty then. We were still not a fan of the yam on the inside and it was just ok. 

I'm a lover of aesthetic places, but I would not come back anytime soon. Being kind of new, I'll forgive some stuff, but the core business products are not worth paying up the whazoo for. 3/5."}
{"text":"Customer service here is horrendous. I came in on a Saturday afternoon with 2 friends. We ordered 3 breakfast sandwiches and coffees. 1 of them came out and the other 2 took 30 more minutes. I asked about the other 2 sandwiches and the girl behind the counter rolled her eyes at me twice. As if it's ridiculous for me to wonder what the hell is happening. I think maybe they had to wait for the chickens to lay eggs. \"We got busy,\" was all she could muster up. Incredibly rude. We waited so long I actually asked for a refund so we could leave without our sandwiches and not be late to meet friends."}
