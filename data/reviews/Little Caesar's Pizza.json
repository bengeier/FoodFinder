{"text":"The food is decent, you do pay for what you get.  My issue is the service.  I went in to get a pizza, and the guy taking orders went right past me several times.  After he let the third person who just walked into the store place an order before me, I let them know what I thought and walked out.  Never again.  I had rather buy a more expensive pizza at Papa Johns or Pizza Hut and get a little better service than get food here again."}
{"text":"Little Caesars is little Ceasars. But this location is the cleanest, friendliest, and best run one I've ever been to. Hands down across the country. Mad props. Yes, occasionally you wait 6 minutes for a hot n' ready- but that just means is fresh. Always awesome.!"}
{"text":"I've only ordered the $5 hot-n-ready pizzas, but they're great if you're in a hurry. Service is prompt and the pizza is tasty, especially considering you're only paying five bucks."}
{"text":"You can't find anything better for this price! Crazy bread is like crack! When there isn't time to cook or you have a lot of mouths to feed fast this is the spot.
Moe was so nice and friendly! Fast service with a smile! Worth the drive to get here for sure :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite choices. What can beat five bucks for a pizza ready to go when you walk in? The cheesy bread and wings are a solid choice too.

Not to long ago my wife was having a rough day. I wanted to surprise her when I came home from work. I stopped by little Caesars, picked up a pizza, then picked up a movie and spent the night cuddling with her on the couch."}
{"text":"Ok here is the deal $5.00 pizza you get what you pay for right? For a dollar more order the new thin crust pizza. I do not know what happen? It was really,really good just a few months ago they started to change the recipe or something. It use to be a thin cracker like pizza dough, but now I am no longer having it. Now it is not so thin and taste like any other pizza place. I would get Red Barron frozen before I were to get this again. I am sorry but it use to be good."}
{"text":"I am going to get some pizza right and I get to the front to pay and one of the manager name Anthony was really really rude when I was asking questions about the different flavors of wings there are and when I was waiting for my pizza are was rude to others as well"}
{"text":"I have visited this location many times. The employees are nice, and service is always fast. The prices are awesome!!"}
{"text":"This particular little Ceasars does a great job! 
I'm not usually a fan of cheap pizzas that sit in warmers, but whatever they do, it's right.   I live very close, so if I am in a rush,  I'll stop here quick.   
The pizza is always hot, and always fresh. 
The crazy bread does vary a little bit. consistency in that department could use a little attention. However the flavor is never bad, and it's never under or over done in my past experience here.   
Beyond the hot and ready pizza, they also have deep dish and bacon crusted pizzas, which I've had once or twice. Average about 8 dollars and feeds 3-4.  With the price. Good quality for the $.
Staff is quite friendly,  and It seems they don't fly through to many employees here. My order is always accurate. 
I just wish they would bring back my buffalo ranch sauce.   (It got discontinued). I did however make a fairly smooth transition over to the cheesy jalape√±o dip."}
{"text":"This chain has definitely assisted with my ever-growing addiction to crazy bread. Sometimes they can be extremely busy and they seem to pump out the orders with these and are always extremely friendly. Just got two orders of crazy bread tonight and it's freaking delicious."}
{"text":"I haven't gone in here for months.  It hasn't changed-  the front counter help always acts like you are troubling them by being there..  There are no smiles and no customer service.  I was told my order would be about 8 minutes... 25 minutes later I was finally on mt way home.   I stopped going here months ago and I won't go again as the people have changed but they train new people to give the same horrible service"}
{"text":"The girl waiting on customers is rude.  When we asked a question..she snickered, and pointed at one of the signs instead of a polite verbal answer."}
{"text":"I atopped in tonight to pick up a quick pizza. When I got there, about7 people were standing at the door entrance. I walked up to the cash register to place my order, when this young afro american man walked up beside me and placed an order. I told him I was there forst. The afro american woman behind the counter took his order. She completely ignored me. His excuse was that the line qas back at the door. Once he got his pizzas and left, no one came up to place an order. The people by the door were already waited on.  The young girl allowed this man to bully his way in front of me. I am a white man, 61 years old, and disabled.  I turned and walked out without  getting my dinner. Seems your company caters to blacks and merely pushes aside white handycapped individuals.  I will not accept an appology, nor any gratuity.  I will simply never patronize your establishment again. I hope you go out of business!"}
{"text":"Cleanest Little Caesars I've ever been in! Very friendly staff, especially for a LC. They were busy but had enough Hot & Ready pizzas for everyone. And of course, $5 pizzas! They are good quality too, especially for the price. There was a homeless man outside, that's never bothered me, but it might affect others (I'm from a different state, so Arizonians might be nicer than those were I'm from!)"}
{"text":"I do love their $5 pizza and how it is always ready.  It is very convenient. The wings are so-so, so normally I just go for the pizza. The staff here are always friendly and the service is quick. They always try to ask you to add on crazy bread or wings, but a simple \"no thanks\" does the trick."}
{"text":"I will never go back. First, as another reviewer stated they charge $1 more than advertised on TV. The biggest reason is they never have anything ready. Even though we place our order first the 5 or so people that come after us get their food before we do. Each time we get this same unfriendly guy,Tim behind the counter who needs training on customer service. I will refrain from using a few choice words to really describe him. I will also be contacting the corporate office. Go elsewhere, definitely not worth the trouble"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool and the pizza was AMAZING, from the moment you walk into the door the place makes you excited to be here. The girl behind the counter, Lisa welcomes you with a smile. Not to many places do this anymore. Well definitely drive by the one in Highland hts to come back here. The pizza was perfect, just the right amount of cheese, pepperoni. 

Lisa is definitely the person to see wha"}
{"text":"I've been getting pizzas here for a while and have had a great experience. I usually get pizza with no sauce and the one time that got that mixed up, they gave me a pizza for free. Just got taken care of by nick and figured it was time to put it on paper that this location has always taken care of me!"}
{"text":"This store has the worst customer service. they never answer the phone for you to order and when they do you are hung up on or put on hold and never answered. the food is never fresh and really skimpy on toppings and cheese. whole staff needs to be replaced. hire more people because they always seem too short staffed. i have been to plenty locations and this by far is the worst. there is plenty of other places to get pizza in the area. i will take my business where it is appreciated."}
{"text":"$5 pizza, OK wings, awesome crazy bread... What more needs to be said. i will say this location is a bit cleaner than most but all-in-all it satisfies my craving for pizza with minimal damage to wallet."}
{"text":"To the lady at mattis store who decided to stick her nose in my wife's business about our special needs son who sat down on the floor and would not get up and you thought her method was wrong,you must have been sleeping on the job, if you had your eyes open you would see he is as big as her or bigger but cause you to stupid to see it and think cause you have a special needs child you know it all, who the fuck are you to tell my wife she needs training she knows more about autism and Down syndrome than you will ever know, for your stupid self her methods are taught by therapists of all kinds you are the one that needs training in special needs and in your current job and so does your manager,so little caesars you lose yet another good customer."}
{"text":"Staying at the nearby Mandalay Bay, the better half and I were looking for something that wouldn't break the bank.  So what could be better than a little taste of home.  

No, its not a buffet, no it has no fancy nightlife, and no it has no flashy theme.  It's just an inexpensive \"just what you expect\" Little Caesar's tucked away inside the Luxor.

If Little Caeser's is what you are looking for, its exactly what you'll get."}
{"text":"Is this my first bad review? Oh no. I was hoping that throughout my entire Yelp Career that I wouldn't experience a place I haven't liked. But the time has come my friends and it has hit like a hurricane.

I came here after a long day of studying. All I wanted some crazy bread. I had a coupon that said I could get them for $1.99 and I went there with the intention. I walked in, it look moderately busy. It was a Saturday night and weekends are usually the prime time for pizza consumption. I didn't even want pizza. 

I walked in and I wasn't greeted with a smile. As a matter of fact, I was greeted at all. I stood there while the cashier was just standing around. I finally built the confidence to say hello. I let out a nice sounding \"hello,\" well I think it was nice. The cashier was uninterested and basically asked me what I would like to order like it was a burden. I felt the awkwardness and told her my order, she obliged and took my payment with so much enthusiasm, that is sarcasm by the way. She basically threw my crazy bread and sauce into the bag and handed me it without even giving me much eye contact. I left without a word and moved on.

At least the crazy bread was good.

But that's it."}
{"text":"Last few times I've come here my pizza has been wrong. I always order cheese or a pineapple pizza and I get something completely different than what i order. Seems like staff isn't pay attention to their orders when handing them out or they don't pay attention when making the orders. Had to waste gas to come back with orders to get them fixed too many times."}
{"text":"We have been coming here once a week for years. In the past couple of months they NEVER have hot n ready pizzas ready! They try to push the more expensive \"extra most bestest\" pizzas (greasy and gross) or make you wait 10 minutes. Last week we went several miles further to the location on Elliot and it was so nice to walk in and grab 3 hot n ready pizzas and go. So dissapointed in our Chandler location!"}
{"text":"Just drive a little further to Hungry Howie's or Domino's. I guess they have new staff because they don't even know the type of pizzas they have. They put little to no sauce on the pizza. They have attitudes. The only positive experience I have is that the pizza is hot, but that's because it just came out the oven."}
{"text":"Completely ridiculously horrible....
Greated at the door by vaping employee who waited to finish his vape to come on and help the waiting customers. I had time to check the 90.5 sanitation rating and the filth and got the hell out of there. Judging  by the crappy attitudes of the workers I think it was wise to leave asap. The tension was through the roof."}
{"text":"Anyone that eats Little Caesars Pizza must have no taste buds. All Little Caesars location's pizzas taste terrible! If you want your pizza on the cheap side, get Domino's."}
{"text":"The girl at the front counter never once smiled and said \"What can I get you?\" The young lady cutting pizza in the back was taking to another coworker and she was talking loud enough that everyone could here her and she used the \"f\" word several times. The girl at the counter never have me a receipt. I smiled and said thank you but that is all that was said. What happened to customer service?"}
{"text":"Usually I can walk right in get my pizza and go. Tonight I went in expecting to wait (Thursday dinner holidays) what I wasn't expecting was an incompetent cashier who literally left the register to go home leaving the cook to take care of pizzas and ring up customers. I also didn't expect numerous people that came in behind me to get their pizzas before I did. I expect fair, reasonable, competent service and did not get that, nor did most of the customers in the store. Perhaps i came at the worst possible time, but there's really no excuse for what happened. I usually grit my teeth if service is bad, but tonight I left with a refund, and still hungry. 

Hopefully the manager fires this employee."}
{"text":"Call in the order tonight. Call ahead is best way to get a fresh pizza, said I would be there in 10 minutes. Pizza was hot and fresh. Elijah was friendly and got the order correct. Best fast deal for a pizza that the kids love."}
{"text":"Not great pizza but fast pizza which is a great feature.   $5 for a classic pizza on demand is a good deal.  You'd spend a lot more than that at a hamburger place.   Its nice that you can drive up, get a pizza, and drive away in 5 minutes.  The place can be a bit busy on a weekend night, so they may run out of classic pizzas, but its not a big wait for them to cook a batch up.  They also have fancier pizzas, but I haven't tried one.  Pizza Hut and the other chains can make better pizzas, but I like Little Caesar's price and speed."}
{"text":"I pick up pizza from here often...it is less then a mile from my house which is convenient. This evening I received great customer service from the employee named Steven S. Even with a lot of customers filing in one after another, Steven was very quick taking orders and helping the guys in the back put them together as needed. It was impressive seeing a younger person hold himself so maturely while staying on top of getting completed orders together and order taking....consistently. He shows care about getting things taken care of and moves faster then anyone else was in that location. I hope Little Caesars knows what an asset he is for the company."}
{"text":"I received awesome customer service with a smile. Joseph is amazing. He gave me  great recommendations and helped me with my purchase. Pizza was good. My favorite location by far!!"}
{"text":"Today marks the 10th pizza I have bought here. I always get the new $6 extra cheese and pepperoni pizza. 7 out of the 10 were great. The other three I wanted to throw on the roof Heisenberg style. Also they don't seem to wipe down the pizza pans so you end up with a super greasy crust which can be tasty but soggy heh."}
{"text":"As much of a pizza aficionado that I am (il Bosco is the best of the best), Little Caesars consistently gets a good portion of my families pizza budget (Barros is our other go to). It's all about the Detroit Deep Dish. They do it better than any I've found. Mrs Beautiful even declares it her favorite (I fear that may be a bit blasphemous, but I can handle a bit of charring on my artesian pizza, she can't). Pizza! Pizza!"}
{"text":"This is a great little place for inexpensive but good pizza. If you go between 4-9pm there are a variety of hot and ready menu items."}
{"text":"Parking is limited and most patrons of this shopping plaza \"improvise\" parking spots.  I've been to this Little Caesar's a few times and the sanitation grade is 94.  Hmmm.  Also, the cashier (a shift manager mind you) repeatedly does not know how to process coupons.  I got my $1 discount, but it requires a calculator and some blank looks.  

Grrr! If the pizza wasn't so cheap, greasy, and reasonably better tasting than frozen pizza, I would have a reason to not return!  But I can't turn down buttery, garlic bread sticks and hearty marinara sauce.  Mmm, mmm, Little Caesars is my guilty pleasure."}
{"text":"Unbelievable. I have given this place the benefit of the doubt many times over. But when I order ahead on 2 items that are already supposed to be \"hot and ready\"(all I ever get but know is never \"ready\"), I assumed I'd be finally getting an order on time. I went in 25 minutes after my order was made and they said they never got a phone order!  I repeated the phone number I ordered from (who refused to take my name at the time or anything to identify me as). They said \"yes, that's our number\" but still didn't have my order or any record to it. I'm through with them. Don't patronize this place. Their place on Prosperity was much better but somehow went out of business. I can't believe this place is still in business. Even a place in DEEP South Carolina had all this stuff ready to go yet this place in a much more concentrated place had nothing including my order ready to go at all. Don't go here!"}
{"text":"Very nice and clean location. Staff keeps the hot and ready pizzas ready to go, no waiting around. They even try to offer you deals which is impressive for a little ceasers. Would go again"}
{"text":"The kids just love their pizza.  For five bucks a pie, you really can't go wrong.  I highly recommend, calling your order in to avoid a wait and to make sure that you get a fresh pizza."}
{"text":"5 stars for excellent customer service that was provided over the phone.  We had a big order to place and the man that took my order did a great job making sure he heard my correctly and listening to my special request. Now for pizza I give them 3 stars. For $5 per pizza that is actually pretty good."}
{"text":"It's a take out little Ceasars.  Staff has always been super friendly.  You can get $5 pizza and now there is a $6 pretzel pizza. ....  usually there are hot and ready pizzas with no wait."}
{"text":"This location does not disappoint. Fast friendly service. Can not go wrong with 5 dollar pizzas. The quality has been consistent over the years. Hot fresh and quick. 
The longest I ever had to Waite was 10 minutes for multiple pizzas, during there peak hours. 
I didn't mind at all, considering most people that come into this location carryout 3 to 4 pizzas."}
{"text":"I've worked for little caesars before so I know how it works...and I know this location doesn't mark their boxes and gives out expired pizzas. The staff is friendly and visits are quick but there's nothing like paying to get an hour old dry pizza when you know that's not how it's supposed to be.  I don't know how they are able to do this because corporate makes visits...look at your pizza before you leave, ask them why they don't mark the boxes and how long they've been in the heater for..."}
{"text":"My order was suppose to be ready at 7:54 PM, get there around 8:08 and they said the just just get my order. I at will take 10 min. Well my order was not ready until 8:40 PM!! When my daughter home with the pizza they left out my another order (breadsticks and wings).  They was not apologetic, they act as they did not care. What was the point of order online?? I highly disappointed with my service today. My second order $8 bucks that I just gave to Little Caesar's, I tried to call the store BUT one picked up. I could not tell the order was not ready because my food was not hot and fresh."}
{"text":"What can I say? It's a $5 pizza. Not expecting greatness just quick, convenient, cheap pizza and this Little Caesars has always delivered for me (not literally, since they don't deliver). Sure you get a hot n ready pizza that sat a little too long every once a while but that's the risk you take with any Little Caesars."}
{"text":"Customer service is thrown out the window. Ordered wings online they were out. Asked for a refund was denied an told to come in the next day. Asked for a manager. The employee then told me I'm off in few we can meet outside. Seriously. Way to go little caesar hire the thug with face tats to handle customer service."}
{"text":"Prompt service. They *smile* too. Can't beat a $5 pizza on the go. I'm grateful their pizza doesn't drip fatty oil like a Papa John's pizza. The Italian cheesy bread is addictive. Carry out only. 

The Italian cheesy bread could come down in price *just a tad*. They were experimenting with these new flavors for chicken wings. We tried the lemon pepper flavor and the wings were a bit on the cold side. Also very bland for the picture they put up on their menu. They look better than what they actually taste."}
{"text":"This place is always busy yet there's rarely a wait for Hot N'Ready pizza. The staff is amazingly friendly and they are so sweet to my children by always giving them cookies. We go here about once a week and will continue to do so because my kids love the pizza and I love the price. Good job!!"}
{"text":"Local coupons are short lived or not honored. Only 2 chairs in the waiting area. Better than some Little Ceasers worse than local stores. 

Answered online survey and manager followed up within minutes to address issues very professionally and friendly. Replacement chairs already on way after previous ones broke."}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious pizza.  What's not to love.  And the Crazy Bread for $2.50 or $2.79 or whatever...perfect.  I really like there sauce too, I think it has more flavor than Papa Johns (the other (more expensive) cheap pizza)."}
{"text":"Good service always prompt and friendly. The pizza is always good quality hot and they actually cut the pizza so you don't have to cut it when you get home like some locations do or other pizza places I recommend going to this location if you are in the area and are craving little cs"}
{"text":"The last time I went here they were out of crazy bread and garlic sauce and this was a normal week night then tonight I went 45-30 minutes before closing and they had already closed everything down. Definitely do not have good things to say about this place right now. Think it's time for new management or new employees."}
{"text":"Great location, friendly staff, and just downright good, delicious, hot, inexpensive pizza!  No frills here, where else can you get a $5 pizza made with fresh ingredients and fresh made (not frozen) dough?   Little Caesars does it right representing Detroit worldwide!  Shout out to Michelle, and awesome general manager who runs a great store... clean restaurant, quick service, always hot pizza!   Keep up the good work !!"}
{"text":"It's Little Caesar's...what more can you say. Cheap, consistent pizza, great for feeding large groups. They are pushing the deep dish lately, but 60% more money for a little more crust, please. For $8-11, you can find a lot better pizza. Friendly staff keeps it a go-to."}
{"text":"Pizza was actually $5.99 and not $5. They weren't hot and ready either. We had to wait about 5-7 minutes for 2 cheese pizzas."}
{"text":"My friend was super excited to get some crazy bread - she kept talking about it since we left Portland.  So I headed over to the Luxor food court from Mandalay for them.  The bread sticks were a little tough and needed more parmesan cheese.  Luckily, we got the dipping sauce to soften it up."}
{"text":"No way can you give Little Ceasars 5 stars but let me tell you you can. I'm from Michigan and the Little Ceasars here in Chandler blows away the ones back home.  We would never get little Ceasars back home but here with four kids we get it 2-3 times a month. 
Never disappoints and is perfect when you don't want to cook. By the way we usually spend less than $20. Come on what a value for the family."}
{"text":"This is the worst little Caesars I've been to. Now I already have really low expectations as it is hot n ready, but every time I get it the pizza tastes like cardboard! Like it's been in a fridge for a week. Since I live close to here I've found that bad pizza is consistent and it was never a fluke. I even tried box just ordering it fresh and waiting around 7 minutes for it and it still came out awful. The crust was too chewy and overcooked, the sauce/ toppings were skimpy (there was a full one and a half inch ring of crust around it), and the cheese was burnt. You'd expect they could at least make good fresh pizza. I'd skip this little Caesars and head to the Pizza Hut across the street or the little Caesars on Val vista and university"}
{"text":"I go to this place to get dinner fast. I have gone and they have been closed early. I have gone and they have not had anything hot and ready. And just about 90% of the time the employees are careless."}
{"text":"Tried and true. Nothing like the good ole Hot and Readys. I'm pretty sure that's all we ever get. Tonight I picked up quite a few pizzas and they had enough ready right then. I love it. Super fast! We also almost always get an order of breadsticks but not sauce. I'm Ok with that since they charge for sauce and I don't eat it. The deep dish pizzas are awesome too. Love em."}
{"text":"Everything is computerized, here.
Clean, airy open space. 

Simple in and out. 
Five chairs in the lobby. 
Honest about turn around time. 

Hey! Works for me as I've got to feed the kids (at the Delta Sigma Theta Creative Writing Symposium). So the last minute $5 Hot & Ready was a blessing we needed. 

#The End."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place. It is what it is. I stopped in to get a deal for my nephew and they loved it. I just like a higher quality pizza. Maybe that comes with my old age. 
But I do think it's still a great place to get a cheap pizza if you're going to have a party for kids. They love it. 
I remember loving this place as a kid when it was still \"Pizza, Pizza\" when you received two pizzas and my mom loved that. She could get what she wanted on one and us kids got what we wanted."}
{"text":"The pizza is better than expected. It's not quite as good as other big chains, and not as good as local or regional places. But, the pizza is pretty good, especially considering the price is 1/3 what you would pay anywhere else. I like good food and don't mind paying for it, but the real reason to go there is that it's so fast. Order delivery and you've got an hour wait ahead.

I go to get a hot and ready large cheese. I've done it three times. Twice, it was ready for me on the spot. Once they didn't have one ready and told me \"it'll be, like, 2 minutes\". They were true to their promise, it was ready in literally (in the literal sense) 2 minutes. Then they apologised to me for my wait. Really? you're sorry I had to wait that long? McDonalds takes longer than that.

The pizza was hot when we got home. 

I read a lot of mixed reviews about this chain. At this one, the service is great, and the pizza, while siting in a hot box, is still fresh. I think that's because this one is busy and has a high turnover of hot and ready pizzas."}
{"text":"If I could give it less than one star I would. I got a pizza from them last night and found a black hair in it. I called the manager who didn't seem very concerned. This is not the only unsanitary thing I've seen here. Definitely considering calling the health inspector. DON'T GET FOOD HERE!"}
{"text":"The hot and ready pizzas are always actually pretty good and the cheese sticks are great. My only issue is the pizzas are never cut properly. I either have to rip them apart or cut them."}
{"text":"Great place to eat,  also ordered a late night five minutes before close and I hate doing this but I had to for my wife. The kind gentleman allowed me to order and pick it up.  And we had very good conversation while waiting for the food!"}
{"text":"I carried out a cheese pizza.  I hadn't eaten at a Little Caesar's pizza in years.  I had an obscure reason for going here, it is to get $2 bonus from Bank of America - but that is a personal side quest and doesn't apply to normal people.  As part of this quest I always ask what is the cheapest thing I can buy, and most of the time I don't get offered the cheapest thing, I get offered the cheapest entree or normal menu item.  This was a case of that happening - I was told hot and ready cheese pizza was the cheapest item.  I think some dipping sauce would have been cheaper.

I got the cheese pizza and I ate most of it in the car.  I don't know what happened but the salty garlic goodness I recall from my childhood was missing.  This pizza just isn't for me.  They changed, I changed, everything changed.  This isn't even the cheapest pizza because of crazy deals other pizza places have.

All I can say is that you really can do better in the fast pizza category (pizzas made on a conveyor belt and not in a traditional pizza oven).  You will certainly do much better to get a non-conveyer belt pizza as well.

The cheese was forgettable, and I hardly noticed any sauce.  The bread was fine."}
{"text":"I have purchased cheap pizza here for years and it had been a so so experience but for the product I always felt the value was OK.  The last 3-5 times the service has gone in the dumper. It's like circus with constant apologies from the staff.  They ask you repeatedly what you ordered.  As concerning is people going from handling money to food and back. I guess time to find somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have to give four stars for the friendly people that work there and the convenience, plus they employ my people with different abilities. Yes, they provide deathly fast food pizza that will cause a slow death if consumed daily, but in moderation it is delicious! The \"Detroit pan\" is a closely related rendition to some of Motor City style pizza and all I would ever get from here. However, if you are a needing to supply a bunch of pizzas for a mass of kids at a block party or neighborhood meeting go here. Your wallet will thank you."}
{"text":"This is my go to for dinner on a really busy night!! It's great & makes all my kids happy, BUT parking is so tight & kind of a nightmare. And often it's busy & I have to wait for my cheese pizza! They need to be better prepared for the busy nights (nearly every night)! But I'm so thankful they are so supportive of the local schools!!! This is why I continue to go back!!! Thanks LC!!"}
{"text":"We visit this restaurant often because its convenient on our way home and always a short time from order to walking out the door.  I am not very patient so appreciate that and the pizza are consistently good and the value is there...inexpensive fast, good eats when you are on the go and hungry.

I have never had a problem with an order until recently, I ordered extra marinara and paid for it, said to put it in the box as with two my hands would be full.  I got home and no marinara.  Either they didn't hear me at the counter...they were busy, or they put on the counter nd I did not wee them to take them.   So I'm out a few bucks, maybe I'll mention it to the boss next time I'm there and they'll hook me up.

Staff is always polite and do a good job."}
{"text":"I've only been to this location once but it was a positive experience. Friendly and efficient service. It's a small location with no ability to dine in but your order will be filled quickly and you'll be on your way to enjoy their delicious pizza in the comfort of your own home."}
{"text":"Walked in on Sunday 2:40 pm and had to wait for deep dish pepperoni but was worth it. Price was great,pizza hot and good customer service by cashier! Will go again !!"}
{"text":"Soooooo let me rant... I came here to order a pizza on my way home I specifically said Light sauce! When I picked up the pizza got in the car the pizza had Extra sauce  ok so I go back and the boy meets me at the front with a face like oh wrong pizza (((whilst chomping on a piece of his on ON THE FRONT LINE!!! Very unacceptable for any restaurant!!!))) I paid it no mind bc I was really hungry an figured I'd just give the pizza a GOOD BLESSING before I ate.. so I swap the pizza & head towards home... I didn't check it bc I just knew they had it right the 2nd time.. I get into my neighborhood I'm hungry asf so I go for a piece.. pop the box More effin sauce man!smh so I pull over call them he answers  I start to tell him about my pizza he's just like \"iight\" \"ok\" \"u coming back\" rude asf man and hangs up in my face!!!!! Nick is his name & disrespect is his game!!!!! So I call back he answers again I tell him I wasn't even done taking before you hung up on me I'm coming back for my money, he's just sitting on the phone & hangs up AGAIN!!! F*ck this dude for real man. I'm on the way back pissed now. I get to the store spoke to the manager she had already put me a new pizza in, showed it to me and everything. I'm grateful for her kindness & her smile bc I had to really bring my life together on this one. Lol. Whatever though. Nick is a butthole. End of story. I won't return. Sorry for my abbreviations & grammar I got re pissed writing this review. Stay away from this dirty place. There are plenty more to choose from."}
{"text":"You know how it says hit and ready? What they mean is hot and ready after you wait for it. This location never seems to actually have the regular pepperoni pizza ready. Don't really seem to matter what time it is."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible pizza. It tastes like a knockoff of a Tombstone pizza was microwaved instead of being baked. The crust is extremely bland and fake tasting. The cheese is sparse, rubbery, and smells like Crisco, believe it or not. The sauces is like a cross between ketchup and Chef Boyardee. I suppose if you like processed foods, Little Caesars may be what you are looking for, but you will probably regret wasting your time, money, and calories on such crap.

0 stars for the nasty crust, rubber cheese, and ketchup sauce. +1 star because they are only $5."}
{"text":"Little Caesars Pizza (700 S Gammon Rd, Madison, WI 53719) is a good pizza place.  Carry-out chain featuring chicken wings, signature bread sticks & pizza tossed from house made dough.  The quality of their pizza is good.  The food is always fresh and we'll presented.  The store is very clean with excellent lighting.  The staff are friendly and are very attentive to customer needs.  No bathrooms but this is a carry out place so no bathroom is expected.

The only issue I have with Little Caesars overall is that the advertise their ready made carry out large pizza for $5.00 on their commercials for year but this price is not available at the stores in Wisconsin, including this store.  This store and others charge $5.99 instead of the $5.00 in the commercials.  I contacted Little Caesars on the web page and they told me that they can't control if their franchises charge more than the commercials which apply to all franchise stores.  This is plain and simply false advertisement at its best since all franchise establishment are bound by brand commercials and advertised prices.  It is only $.99, which is nothing, but it is the principle that if they advertise something they should live up to it.   They are definitely doing this on purpose as like I said no stores in Wisconsin charge the $5 but charge $5.99.

Would have given them more in the star rating since they have good pizza and quality but price deception does not deserve more.  Bad for reputation as they lost me as a customer due to deceptive advertisement."}
{"text":"Waited 15 min before they opened outside in the cold... Walk a few blocks also. Delivery guy (maybe manager) unlocked door early & sold me a pizza, before posted opening!  Pizza craving now fixed for this semi driver!!"}
{"text":"I enjoy a deep dish from here. The service has its moments. It just seems like something always goes wrong here."}
{"text":"Little Caesars is definitely a college classic!  Anyone who goes to Charlotte or lives in the University area knows about those nights, sitting in their apartment/dorm with empty pockets and empty stomachs.  The hunt is on!  Flip over the couch cushions, dig in the cracks, check the car, and scrounge up 6 bucks for a large pepperoni pizza on the fly!

Some may not be fans, but hey, you get what you pay for.  And for $6, that is the best pizza one could hope to get.  I am definitely a fan of the Little Caesars.  Pizza! Pizza!"}
{"text":"I just walked out.  Told the manager that this location has now lost my business. 

I walked in with a $50 bill.  Is currency that's issued and backed by the United States treasury.  Ordered $20 worth of pizzas, breadsticks and drinks.  Was told they can't change bills that large.  When pressed, they changed and said they won't change bills gnat large.

When service service is bad bad, I stop stop.

Peace out!"}
{"text":"Love their pizza. The place is always clean. The staff are very professional and they always have a smile and very polite. They sell most than pizza which I like. If want good fast food and very quick service This is the place to go."}
{"text":"I definitely agree with Chris. You do get what you pay for. But you can't get a better pizza for cheaper! (or if you can someone let me know!) I love the crazy bread, definitely my favorite! Your meal is most likely incomplete without it. Being close to campus is a savior for any broke college kid craving pizza. Not the best, not the worst, all in all, I'm a fan of Little Caesar's!"}
{"text":"I got to say that Little Caesar's saved the day. We had a gathering at our house for fight night and with little notice Little Caesar's was able to whip up 4 large pizzas for all the kids we did not account for :)
Within 15 minutes after I made the call, the pizza was hot and ready for me to swing by and pick it up. Let me say that every kid was a huge FAN of Little Caesars and we where pretty impressed with the quality and price. $5 for a large one topping.
If you want decent, consistent pizza without breaking the bank then Little Caesars is the way to go."}
{"text":"This location is great. I generally try to eat pretty healthy, but this place is fantastic. Whenever I'm in a rural or need something quick, they deliver. Awesome staff, fresh pizza and a franchise I can always count on!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting here for almost a half hour and I just got told that they barely put my pizza in the oven. I can here all of the workers goofing off, laughing and insulting each other while everyone is waiting. Terrible service."}
{"text":"Nothing but a bunch of Punk Kids working at this location!! The wait for your food takes forever, not only that they act like your bothering them when they are suppose to be doing their job not making you feel like an inconvenience!! I will never go back to this little Caesars again!! Like I said not worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. Can't even tell you how the food was because I walked out after standing for 5 minutes without even being acknowledged. When I walked in, the guy was counting down a register. Didn't even bother to say anything to me at all. There were 7 pizzas in their warming stand, and after standing there I thought \"who knows how long they've been sitting there\". Considering the people inside weren't even decent enough to say hi, I doubt they're decent enough to serve fresh food."}
{"text":"Every thing is pretty kool here at this location. Although I was greeted when I came into the store I was greeted when someone came to ring me up. When the door opens at other location I get hellos from staff but nope not here.
The store look well maintained and I've noticed some upgrades over the years. Being an ex employee at this location I can see they have exceeded in some are but others need help. The wait time is pretty long here. you would think that for lunch this location would have lunch boxes ready. But no not only no lunch boxes but no hot n ready either. It's ok I still love this location and highly recommend this place to anyone in the Mesa location. The Owner (tyler) have done a great job with this location I was excited to walk in and see the old store. Unfortunately there not much life in this location they are I guess all about business not very social and I'm use to that. If there was any recommendations I'd say have hot and ready READY bring some life to work. Customer sit in lobby looking hungry or dead. No offense but a like communication with the folks in the lobby is needed sometimes."}
{"text":"Average rating for average pizza. Mostly come here on account of the husband. Definitely better then frozen pizza for the price. Nice and fast. I've only had to wait one time for a pepperoni pizza. Every other time I'm in and out. We like their bread sticks with marinara sauce. Don't get their wings they just aren't good. Were cold on the inside the one tine we tried them, probably still frozen. Overall, if your in a hurry its quick but not very healthy dinner for the family."}
{"text":"WARNING: The \"Hot and Ready\" $5 pizza, is ready, yes...but a little TOO ready. I was given a pizza with stale cheese and sauce. The cheese looked coagulated grey...I'm not kidding. The pizza was probably sitting in that \"heat thing\" for 5 hours or more, and the pizza was just warm, not  \"hot\". That was the worst pizza I've ever had in my life, and I almost threw up...and that rarely happens in my life. I trashed the pizza for the birds and rats because I just couldn't handle it and I love freaking pizza. Ask for it fresh, because you might get one of the SURPRISE mysterey pizzas that I got. Lucky me. It's truly a gamble at this place. Sometimes fresh, sometimes stale. No consistency. Little Caesar's: Eat Stale."}
{"text":"Never seem to have deep dish ready, and often even a wait for the regular hot and ready pizzas.. Sorta defeats the purpose of cheap and ready pizza. If I wanted to wait id order something better."}
{"text":"I like coming to this shop because the employees have always been great. They are kind and make small talk with you. Keep up the good work!"}
