{"text":"Love the chicken noodle soup at this place!  The ingredients (chicken, bok choy, mushroom) are finely chopped and the noodle is served with a flavorful milky chicken broth.  It's a must go place everytime i have a business trip in Toronto.  Actually, I think i came here 3 days in a row and order the same noodle!  It was just that good!"}
{"text":"the singore Chicken does not come with chicken brooth rice but Coconut rice.  It is  definitely a negative.   The Chicken tastes good and the portion is big. A main entree with soup / drink for $ 7.88 is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Chef's Special Beef Noodle Soup($7.99).  I was 20 minutes late to Oriental Cafe because of the stupid Rutherford road rush hour nightmare, Mayor Bevilacqua better take notes.  That 20 minutes cost me the Lunch Special pricing dude, YOU owe me!  One of the couple tables this evening, the mother/daughter staff took care of me quite well.  The Beef Noodle had lots going for it as it had a nice rich broth however not as spicy as I wish for but still very nice overall.  This would be a close 2nd in Beef Noodle Broth quality from places I've had.  The BEEF was actually from the Beef Short Rib part that is commonly used in Korean dishes.  Upon inspection, it was cooked to perfect tenderness that the Bone was easy to remove and just the Meat was served.    What brought this near perfect dish down was simply the NOODLES.  It was just a wrong choice of Shanghai store-bought Noodles although plenty was offered, it was just that variety of Noodle that lack the nice chewiness.  This dish isn't served Taiwanese style but rather Chinese style since it wasn't served with Pickled Mustard Greens."}
{"text":"This place is good for one dish and one dish only, so do not order anything else.  The chunked beef noodle in soup is their specialty and what a good dish it is!  My husband and I (especially by husband) really like this style of noodle and have tried many places throughout all of Toronto. This is by far one of the best places to have it. The beef is cooked to just the right tenderness even though it is we'll done. The noodle is thick and have the right amount of texture to compliment the beef. The best of all is the soup base. It is a flavorful and rich beef broth with some spiciness added to it that enhances the taste rather than overpower it.   During lunch a free cup of Hong Kong style milk tea is served for free. While not the best (that honor goes to marathon cafe at midland/finch) it is slightly above average. The tea is not too dark and goes down smooth as it should.  Like any other Chinese restaurant in the world, the priority is places on quality and price, not service. You come for food, not a chat with the staff. They are friendly but temper your expectations."}
{"text":"I love eating Noodle Soup so I can be quite bias to a place that have over 10 different kind of noodle soup with tea/coffee starting from $5.25 for lunch!  Oriental Cafe is a lot cleaner than the 2 other restaurants beside and across from it. The seats are all heavily cushioned and are quite comfy.  The lunch special starts at 11 AM to 6:00 PM so you can really have an early lunch or a late late late lunch. There are 3 different pages of special that they offer.. includes both Shanghai, Cantonese and some Western Chinese Cuisine.  I order the chef's special beef noodle soup. The beef is quite good and the size is just perfect!  Now I want to try every single soup noodles on the menu!  CASH only!"}
