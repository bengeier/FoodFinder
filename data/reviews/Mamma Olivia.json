{"text":"Decided to do some last minute shopping with my wife (Talia) and as we were on our way out I noticed that the old Olivia's closed and a new restaurant opened. So we chose to give Mamma Olivia's a shot. When we first walked up we were greeted by a very friendly hostess and the manager, Gina, who then informed us about the specials they were having as well as the happy hour that was running from 2-6. As I am a very avid happy hour junky that was music to my ears! Needless to say we grabbed a booth, which we were able to choose ourselves, and were promptly served a complimentary bruschetta. The kids were getting hungry so this helped keep the little gremlins at bay while we looked over the menus. We started with the fritto misto which was deep fried deliciousness! The shrimp, calamari, and broccolini were cooked perfectly and wasn't served with half of the grease coming out of the fryer onto the plate. We then ordered a caprese pizza for the kids excluding the basil and ordered osso bucco and lobster spaghetti for my wife and I. The presentation of all the plates shows how much the chefs preparing the food really care about it. It felt like every piece of food on the plate was purposefully placed and demonstrated a thoughtfulness on the very edge of art. A few bites into the food the manager Gina stopped by and first asked our kids if they were liking the pizza; who then answered enthusiastically that it was better than anything we (the parents) have ever cooked for them. After a good laugh we told her that the food was outstanding and full of flavor! The service from Josh was top notch and the atmosphere of the place says classy authentic Italian food. We will definitely be back to visit again with the whole family and can't wait to try new stuff from the menu! Thank you again for everything!"}
{"text":"Mamma Olivia's had the cheese wheel I've been dreaming of! A great experience! The staff was very friendly and on top of whatever our table needed! The food came out very fast! I would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I was so, so excited to dine here just for the wheel however, it turned out to be a total disappointment. As one other reviewer put it, the cheese wheel was a total gimmick. I'm almost certain that no cheese melted off of the parm wheel. The manager, who also did the table side flambé, was struggling to carve/chip cheese chunks off of side of the wheel into the pasta. The chunks of parmesan that did make it into our dish were solid and blackened. Don't get me wrong the food was still good, but you're paying ~$20pp (minimum order is 2) to essentially toss alfredo pasta in a bowl that happens to be made of cheese, which IMO is not worth it. 

Another reviewer who highly recommended this restaurant mentioned that they had learned to cook authentic Italian food in Italy and that the food here is the real deal. He/she raved about the freshly, in house baked garlic bread and extremely fresh calamari. The calamari was fresh, but it was nothing special. 

I'm a Frenchie and I take two foods very seriously...my cheese and my bread. Sadly to say I was disappointed with both."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying what an amazing place. Came in with some friends to originally try out the happy hour menu. Josh was helping us at the bar & the drinks were on point. We tried out some of the happy hour mini entrees I had the penne alla vodka (Yummy) my friend had the flatbread (big portion for only $5) and my other friend tried the fried calamari (amazing aswell). We then moved to a booth and decided to proceed to try some of the dinner menu entrees. We shared a spagethi frutti de mar and thank god we shared it because huge portion yet so YUMMYYY!! Our server was Thalia once we moved to a table and what a sweet very attentive server. We also met Gina the manager and she too was amazing, talked with us and offered a complimentary desert to us. 

Overall: the food was great, staff was wonderful, and decor was amazing. I, along with my friends, will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at Mamma Olivia last night and it was amazing. We loved the cheese wheel pasta with pesto sauce! Anna and Josh were amazing! They provided a great service! The food is really delicious! The pasta tasted fresh, the antipasto salad with salami and cheeses was so delicious! We enjoyed the atmosphere, they did a really good job on the bar with huge screens, the tables are comfortable and the decoration is delicate. I will recommend it to all my friends and I will go back there soon! :)"}
{"text":"Great  food  great service  loved  the shrimp scampi  and meatballs  were very good  pasta primavera great sauce big portions fantastic service Tucker  I love this place"}
{"text":"I got the pasta cheese wheel that they show online and it was the one of the best pastas I've ever had. The people were so nice too. I have never experienced such great service like that. Do not be weary just because it is located at the mall, it was great! I will definitely be coming back! Amazing! Also, online the portions for the cheese wheel pasta look very small, but they are actually quite large in person."}
{"text":"I don't like leaving bad reviews and this place isn't too terrible but my experience was. The waiter was really nice but he was new and he got my order wrong, I ordered a pesto fettuccine on the cheese wheel, but he got me an Alfredo sauce instead. I explained I didn't mind the Inconvenience as long as he can get the food I ordered correctly but they brought the same Alfredo fettuccine with pesto added to it and the food was now cold. I am disappointed because the idea of the cheese wheel was appealing but not only there was not any cheese from the cheese wheel that got on my pasta because the poor nice man didn't know how to work he wheel and the mediocre pasta was cold. I really wanted to like the place, and  was really looking forward to try the other food from their menu but I am not going to be back there anymore after that experience."}
{"text":"I tried this place out with my family, it was  great never though of finding REAL ITALIAN food at the Boulevard mall , very cozy excellent service and the food was amazing, we spoke to a gentleman named Sergio who approached us at our table and he let us know how the pasta is made freshly there everyday, so I decided to try it and let me say I've been to Italy my self and this was some of the best pasta I've had , I would even say better than the food I had in Italy. This place is a MUST TRY ."}
{"text":"Was super excited to take my girlfriend here to eat. That's being said, it was a horrible experience. They sat us actually in the mall, I could reach out an touch the mall guest. Had to ask for refills because they would forget to bring them. The price on the shrimp scampi is 15 dollars for 4 pieces of shrimp an broccoli that I believed to be microwaved. Also ordered the calamari an got maybe 9 small pieces. I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken(cost extra to add any kinda meat) could not eat it. So blain an super under seasoned. The chicken was thin an super chewy, you can tell they are using cheap meat. The girlfriend got the chicken piccata. She as well couldn't eat it. The mashed potatoes was highly over seasoned with garlic salt. The chicken was over seasoned with salt as well has being thin an chewy. Unfortunately we will not be dining at this establishment again."}
{"text":"We were looking for another restaurant but found they had gone out of business. Happened on this place instead, took a chance and what a find! We've been back several times and is definitely a go-to place at least several times a year on business. The Osso Bucco is to-die-for but everything else we've has has been awesome as well. Customer service here is second to none!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this restaurant yesterday.  We were hungry. The staff was exceptational , inviting and attentive. The food was another story. It could have been a lot better.  I had the margherita pizza. The dough was tasty but the top part of the pizza did not have much taste.  My husband had the spaghetti and it was overcook and mussy. They also brought us bread. Now that was delicious. I not sure if we will go back."}
{"text":"Just noticed this week old gem; beautiful decor and excellent food and service. In this location you don't expect such a modern restaurant. The bar area is very nice and has many TVs to watch sports games.  Our waiter was very polite and had good conversation with the manager as well."}
{"text":"My first time in MammaOlivia after I tasted their food I thought I was in Italy.  I am a world traveller and have been to Europe hundreds of times.  This is one of the best Italian restaurants I ever experienced from Rome, Milano, Florence.  The chef Marco  I got to know him is from Tuscany, the Maitre D Jeanna is from Rome and the general manager Sergio is also from Italy.  All their dishes are excellent and they made their own pastas.  Even their desserts are superb.  You will love their food and friendly service and the price is very reasonable.  Enjoy !

{"text":"Had lunch with my 3 year old and mom, 5 stars from all of us! Great service, yummy food and nice atmosphere. Skip the food court and and check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"Simple Alfredo 
Chicken was rubber
Sauce was liquid
Salty 

Tiramisu 
Had some weird grease around it 
 
Staff was nice 
Waiter was nosy 
Busser was an awesome he turned into our waiter

Nice atmosphere 
I came for lunch 
Maybe dinner is better 
I don't remember how much it was 
I just remember I didn't like it"}
{"text":"Don't knock the place because it's At the boulevard mall. This place is great. Super nice, and chill. The food was great . We got the cheese wheel pasta! Must try you get a show. Will def come back and try more stuff. Our waiter tucker was awesome!"}
{"text":"Great. Fantastic. Wow. I don't even like cheese but THIS cheese. Wow. Legendary. Delicious. Out of this world. And the dessert? Wow."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!!!  Just what the area needs. The food is as good if not better then some of the restaurants on the strip. All the seafood tastes and looks fresh and the selection is great! We will be back often."}
{"text":"Like someone else said, don't let the location fool you! A friend and I just had the tastiest experience here! Came here for the cheese wheel pasta and we have no regrets. We were greeted by a very friendly waiter who had great service skills, always making sure to check on us. He made sure to answer any of our questions and guided us through the order process for the cheese wheel pasta. There were certain rules (like 1 flavor for a minimum of 2 people), and other add-ons to the pasta. We chose the flavor with pesto on it, and added shrimp to it for an extra charge.
Our food came with a complimentary bread basket and sauce, not sure what kind but it was like vinegar and had oil. The waiter brought the cheesewheel over and made our pasta in front of us. It is quite interesting to watch! From the cheese on fire to the stirring, it was mouth-wateringly enticing to witness in front of us. You also get the option to add parmesan and crushed red pepper to your pasta. Me and my friend both looooved our food! I couldn't finish mine but thankfully I was able to bring it home. Spent about $47 and will be back to try another flavor!"}
{"text":"*Update: Please see below for original review!
Anna, the assistant GM graciously invited us back. She stated that they would be able to make the fettuccine alfredo without meat upon request. We haven't been able to make it back yet, but we definitely will. I'll let you know what we think!!

------------------------------------------------

Tried to take my girlfriend on a date night for the infamous cheese wheel. She was super excited to get the fettuccine alfredo and watch them flambé it at the table!! 

When we got to Mamma Olivia, the place didn't have too much business. Very cute atmosphere, don't let the location deter you. We were seated immediately and Tucker came right over. The reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because of the customer service. 

BEFORE YOU GO--you can not customize the fettuccine alfredo...it comes with prosciutto, ham, and peas. The peas are the only item that can be removed. Apparently they are not vegetarian friendly. My girlfriend is completely against the idea of prosciutto and ham, so unfortunately we could not do the cheese wheel. There were two other options...unfortunately not what she was looking for. Because of this, we opted to leave. The cheese wheel was our only reason for coming to Mamma Olivia...

Tucker apologized for the inconvenience and offered alternatives. We definitely appreciated his empathy and attempt at finding another option. 

I cannot speak on behalf of the food as we left because the cheese wheel could not be modified. Customer service, A+. Concept of the cheese wheel is epic. Hopefully one day we can try"}
{"text":"The women's cancer center of Nevada had its Christmas party along with the staff from the apothecary shoppe here. Unbelievably great pizzas and pastas at prices that were reasonable. Great quality and value ...so hard to find today. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Located right inside the same plaza as Boulevard Mall. I was captivated from the cheese bowl on IG and knew I had to check this place out. My friend and I visited during lunch on a weekday when it wasn't busy. The host was also our server, who also seemed to be the manager on site as well. He was a man of many roles, and I'm not sure I liked that. He didn't seem proficient heating and mixing up the pasta in the cheese bowl. There were many times when the cheese bowl tried to escape him. The cheese was not stringy as most pictures capture it to be. The cheese was short and underwhelming even after I requested it to be long and stringy. Maybe a server could have fulfilled my request? Or maybe once the restaurant gets a hang of your business--they are fairly new afterall? 

The food was just okay. I've had better Italian food elsewhere in Vegas at a comparable price. I do recommend the penne with vodka sauce here! You can't ever go wrong with vodka sauce. Their space is large, so I do hope that they improve so they can utilize the volume they were meant to handle."}
{"text":"Walked into an empty restaurant @6:16 pm. Maybe two parties seated at most. Asked for a table for 3. Was informed it would be 15 minutes. We said even to be seated??? It's empty? The person who I assume was the manager checking people in. Said, \"Yes, 15 minutes, we don't want our chef to be overwhelmed.\" It was an empty restaurant. I came in wanting their flaming pasta Alfredo. I left after arriving not even interested even giving them any patronage. For being in business to serve people food. They seem pretty uninterested in feeding people."}
{"text":"Got to the location at 6 PM and there was only one table with people in the whole place. No one was at the bar. Was told it would be 15 min wait for a table because they did not want to overwhelm the staff. Not only was that crazy but the male host/mgr was completely rude. 3 of us walked out and told 4 other customers who walked away. Four other people left when they were told the same. Not sure how they expect to make money with no customers. I give them 6 months. Think they need to help and seat customers they probably lost $250 from just the folks they pissed off in the 5 mins we stood there."}
{"text":"Live right across the street from the mall where this place is nuzzled and dropped in with my boyfriend; since then we've been about 3 or 5 times. He noticed it before I did and knows my love for Italian food is thick. First we took the 1 minute walk from our apartment to the mall. We get in and it doesn't feel like we're at the mall. Place is scarce so we're like maybe it's not that great but we were pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere and too busy wondering what days they do the live music to care about no one being there. It's actually kind of nice.

 To start we got the Margherita pizza. I always judge an Italian spot on their ability to make a good traditional Margherita pizza. Few places in town actually get it right. Though this place isn't quite all the way traditional it is still delicious and satisfying. Good sauce and fresh basil. Close, but still nothing can top the Margherita pizza at the Encore in my eyes.

For dessert, we had the most amazing pistachio gelato that we practically fought over. The pistachios (I'm guessing) were ground finely ground and mixed in throughout the gelato which gives it this kind of gritty but tasty texture.

All in all this place is great, nice staff, great prices, don't know why it's in the mall but I think it adds to the appeal. I've been here on my birthday to try their fettuccine alfredo which is great but add ins for meat are extra."}
{"text":"This place is just amazing!!! Came here tonight and had live karaoke and the food was outstanding!! We had the fettuccine Alfredo made in the cheese wheel and it's a show and yummy! Staff was really fun and so helpful, nice , positive and just enjoyable!! My drink that Tucker made me the lemon berry blush was off the hook! Please go visit him and ask for this drink. Ive been seeing this place advertised on Facebook and IG and finally made it here and I literally couldn't be happier with the service! I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Wow! I looooove the food here. The Olivia's salad is delicious with hearts of palm & avocado - two of my favorite things. Also the zucca ravioli is Amazing! It is slightly sweet with butternut squash & a hint of brown sugar but you still know you are eating a pasta dish. The restaurant has a very nice atmosphere & the service is great. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"For Hispanic people, today is Mother Day. We all came here with no expectations, just hoping for the best. 

We got seated right away and our waitress Kenya took over. We started off with a bottle of wine and two orders of their calamari. Calamari was delicious, only down fall was how small the portion was. 
The whole table had something different, but one of the main things we went for was... (drum roll) the cheese barrel! I've never experienced that before so I knew we had to try it. My sister and I both decided to do fettuccini Alfredo in the cheese barrel with a side of shrimp. Pasta was delicious, so simple yet full of flavor. Even my nieces kids pasta was tasty. 
I'm excited to have found a new Italian place where my whole family really enjoyed. Service was great, Kenya was really nice and patient with us. Do not judge this place for being at the Boulevard mall, you'll be surprised."}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal!!!! If I could give them a million stars I would. Tucker was our waiter. He has such an awesome personality and was on top of things. You can definitely tell he takes pride in his excellent service. He was assisted by James and Kenya who both were on top of things as well. They made sure our glasses were full and our table was clear of dirty dishes. The general manager Gina was a riot! She is from Italy and was an absolute doll to converse with. The food!!!!! The food was amazing!! We tried 5 different appetizers, all of them were delicious. They do a cheese wheel pasta. If you don't know what that is, Google it. I had the Zucca raviolis and they were killer. This place was better than the Italian restaurant I went to on the strip. I will be recommending this restaurant to everyone I know and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food was not all that great. Didn't get to enjoy it  sadly spent $100. Not on the bright side the waiters were very nice  great customer service."}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean and looked amazing! We came after school at around 11:30 and it was generally empty. The Assistant Manager Anna showed us to our table and she was so nice and helpful! We ordered the Alfredo and pesto cheese wheels which were both absolutely delicious and would highly recommend getting it with chicken!!! The wheels are rolled out and are made right in front of you. Anna did an excellent job at preparing it. The pesto was so delicious and flavorful it was ORGASMIC! 

Mama Olivia's is seriously a gem in this city!"}
{"text":"Surprising that I have all good things to say about a Italian restaurant but dang I do ... ok so I know that it is new but I like the decor, came in between rushes as the diner count was low but waitstaff Ivan friendly and attentive. Btw Love the hostess Gina found out she is the manager  clean smells good restrooms up to date clean.... kudos to the chef the soup with the egg drop and chicken spinach mmmmmm good... had chicken parmesian sandwich for lunch, could do that everyday with those fries ... she had a panino capri and loved as well.... Do not let the standards down..... nice touch the creme brulet but better the taste of it OMG"}
{"text":"Omg!!!! Food....BOMB.....drinks...BOMB!!!!! I will come back and recommend everyone to come here! Everyone is so nice and cares about there guests! Wish everyone was like this! Thank you Mamma Olivia!!"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Italian restaurant off strip! Highly recommend and will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I dropped in on a whim, a rare night away from the kids as we ran some errands in the mall, and this place so exceeded all of my expectations. From the beautiful modern decor to the exceptional service from Thalia and her team, to the delicious food...I was blown away and left so happy and so satisfied. And I have to thank our oh-so-sweet server, Thalia, for her great suggestions, more than friendly service, and especially treating us to some delicious cheesecake for dessert."}
{"text":"Finally came by to try this restaurant on a whim!! Was blown away. Amazing homemade pasta!! I'm a fan"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, not a fan. We went here for my boyfriends birthday and it was not what we were expecting. My boyfriend found this place through social media and was dying to try the cheese wheel. Like previous reviews say, it's limited on what/how you can get the cheese wheel and it requires two guests minimum.

Cute, nice atmosphere and the customer service was great, very friendly but it seems as though only 1 person was working about 7-8 tables and he just seemed behind/in a rush/too much on his plate, etc. They had live singing which was entertaining. However, the food was not authentic or tasteful.The chicken was awful, I took one bite and had to spit it back out. I'm huge on texture and it just wasn't good. The fettuccine alfredo was just.. meh."}
{"text":"So we went on a Saturday afternoon, and the place is woefully understaffed. They had one server and one bartender performing double duty as a server. Fine. Then they advise me the draft beer is out and unavailable. This was very disappointing as I look forward to draft beer on the weekends. They kindly brought us a bread basket, but it only had three slices of bread-and we were a table of four. That was awkward. Our request for a second bread basket went unfulfilled. Service is what sets any Italian restaurant apart from a chain like Olive Garden, and, I'm sorry to say, service is in major need of an improvement at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Im local here in Vegas, you can say ive been all over. 
My buddy invited me to try this new italian restaurant Mamma Olivia in the BoulevardMall. 
The place is nice and cozy, with football game on.
The pit boss is an Italian himself, so he knows what hes talking about. 
He recomended the Ossobucco Veal, i asked him what was that, he nicely explain to me slow cooking Oxtail and love the way they cooks. 

This is probably the best italian resto in vegas.
Veal Ossobucco is my favorite from now on.
Their service is so different, its so italian. 

They have full bar in the middle with a bunch of widescreen TV. 

Im very impress!!!"}
{"text":"This food was excellent! It was so good I forgot to take pictures! We ate it all up! Good portions and happy hour is fantastic. They make there pasta fresh every day! Definitely be back! You should swing by and taste the Italian tradition."}
{"text":"Always great food !
Yummy yummy fettuccine Alfredo so good !
Alfredo sauce with prosciutto delicious !
Thanks Mamma Olivia !"}
{"text":"this place is way out of its league for the location! stopped in here for happy hour and got the flatbread and penne a la vodka. starting from the complimentary garlic bread i already fell in love. you can tell the bread is freshly made and it's so good w/ olive oil. the flatbread is HUGE. especially for happy hour it's definitely going to fill you up. the pasta was really great also. i thought i would have to order more but i could barely finish these two!

okay the food was bomb but let me just tell you how tasty the desserts were, i give it a 1000/10. you need to try the tiramisu and the cannolis, you'll cry they are so good"}
{"text":"Wowwww this place is amazing. I can't even explain the taste you have to go in a try everything I was able to take a picture of the tiramisu before I devoured it. One of the best I've ever had you must get it before leaving. Thanks to our server tucker for making us laugh and being a great host he takes a lot of pride in where he works!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Not loud food is amazing! Don't miss this great restaurant! Service was great very accommodating  we will definatly be coming back!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and food! Its a bit far from us but totally worth the trip. The customer service is unreal. We got the penne pesto cheese wheel pasta (btw its minimum two people) along with the bruschetta and it was delicious. We even got a free dessert (thanks Gina!).  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian food and service in Las Vegas. Probably not the best location for them, however the boulevard mall is starting to get a lot more attraction with sea quest and the other family friendly places so hopefully this place will start to get the recognition it deserves. 

Butternut squash ravioli was amazing! Portions are on the small side but you're going for taste not quantity and it's worth it! 
Sausage ravioli was great too. 
We also ordered chicken Alfredo and that portion size was huge and of course delicious. 
I would much rather have great flavor and smaller quantity than have crap food in a large amount. 
Will definitely be returning! 
Our server Thalia was very sweet and helpful with the menu. She put up with our crazy indecisiveness and made some great suggestions."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Short staff forsure then bothered when asked for refills. This place is a place that caters to big parties and reservations. Food was not good. Pasta was under cooked and cold.  Will not be going back and wouldn't recommend anyone to go"}
{"text":"We have eaten at Olivia's 3 times and each time the food has been excellent. The waitstaff doesn't hover but stops by enough to take care of your needs. Gina, the manager is awesome and I definitely recommend Olivia's to anyone who remotely likes Italian food!"}
{"text":"Went for late lunch, food was delicious, we had the meatball sandwich, veggie sandwich and Caesar salad. Service also excellent."}
{"text":"Last week - We started with the mozzarella and tomato appetizer (caprese salad) - best I've had in all of Las Vegas - fresh and delicious. Then we shared the Meatball Panini and the Zucca Ravioli and my friend said they were the best meatballs she's had in Las Vegas. We ate all of the ravioli (which melted in my mouth), we tried to save some to take with, but couldn't help but eat all of it. Waiter told us that those particular ravioli are a popular dish. I'll be back very soon because this is my new fave place in vegas. Waiter extremely friendly, too and Gina came by to make sure we were happy with our meal."}
{"text":"This is the best Italian food to taste! Not to mention the cheese wheel bowl n the fresh pasta! My husband had the lobster ravioli with the pink vodka sauce! The appetizer were fresh CALAMARI! The service is great! A def must have."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today for the first time while shopping at the Boulevard Mall.We ordered the Sole Piccata and it was sooo 
good !! The fish was prepared perfectly and the Sauce was very tasty ! Also the Caesar's Salad was crisp with a light and creamy dressing ( I ordered the anchovies too). We will definitely go back ! Our Server, Thalia was very pleasant and helped us to make this great choice !"}
{"text":"My daughter Jessica brought me here for Mother's day lunch celebration. Loved both the food and service! It was our first time dining here so we decided to just experience the small plates on happy hour for only $5.95 a plate. Did not disappoint! The food was amazing as was our server, Tucker! Calamari fritti was perfectly and lightly battered. Gnocchi bolognese is made in house and tasted delicious. We will definately come back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I made a special stop here because we had seen them advertised on social media with this awesome video of them with fettuccine alfredo in a cheese wheel and couldn't wait to try it!
   We came on a late Friday afternoon and there was only a couple people inside, we chose to eat outside on the \"balcony\" area which is just outside the restaurant inside the actual mall. 
    Our waiter brought us some fresh complimentary bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. It was DELICIOUS! We had it replaced twice and one gentleman who also helped with our table, I assuming one of the owners, was so polite and said it was fresh baked that morning.
    Going through the menu I had planned to order something off that and my friend was going to get the alfredo in the cheese wheel (according to the video on social media the cheese wheel option was a \"secret\" menu item so it was not listed). To our dismay, our waiter told us that for the cheese wheel option you HAVE to get two servings to order it and it HAS to be of the same pasta flavor. I was a little upset, but my friend really wanted to try the cheese wheel so I agreed to not get my option and go with the pasta (I'm not a big pasta person).
    For our appetizer we ordered the calamari ($12) that's served with marinara sauce. I asked them if they had like a garlic aioli to serve with it as well because I personally wasn't a big fan of marinara sauce with calamari. When we received the app but they didn't include the marinara at all (my friend did want it) but instead it was just drawn butter with garlic. Not their fault, I think it was a communication issue but they tried to accommodate my request even though a mayonnaise sauce isn't the same as butter. So, although the dipping \"sauce\" was off the calamari itself was very good and very tender.
    For our entrees we ordered the two pasta orders for the cheese wheel but again were disappointed because we were informed that they no longer do the fettuccine alfredo in the cheese wheel :( They have three options and we went with the pesto and prosciutto penne ($16 ea). The gentlemen came out and did the whole display with the wheel which was super cool and answered all our questions. He put a fresh bowl of romano cheese at the table and then came out with crispy prosciutto for the pasta. The pasta was very good, a little salty even before adding extra cheese but very good. Like I said I'm not the biggest fan of pasta so I took almost the whole thing to go as dinner later to share but the taste was there and I do love me some pesto and prosciutto! 
    All in all the service was terrific, they definitely have their customer service down and the food is really really good. I just wish that to get the pasta in the wheel you didn't have to have the two orders of the exact same pasta dish. I hope if I do come back I'll get to try another menu item, and I recommend anyone that's hesitate to try them out not to be! They are great!"}
{"text":"I moved to Las Vegas in 1971 and still live in the same neighborhood on the east side of town. 
In the mail I received a postcard coupon (see two pix) from Mamma Olivia's which read: \"50% off buy 1 entree and receive 1 free\" so my neighbor and I decided to give this restaurant to try because it's only a couple of blocks away and who doesn't like a BOGO?!
We entered the restaurant which was really nice looking and 95% empty. We sat down and our server introduced himself to us, I think his name was Josh. Neither of us wanted a cocktail so my friend ordered a coffee and asked for cream and sugar. The coffee was delivered with sugars but no cream. I asked Josh again to bring cream. About three minutes later we got the cream. We ordered and each of us commented on the food: pretty good although my lobster was a bit chewy. When we were ready to leave, I gave Josh the coupon and he took it to bring the final check.  When he came back he said something like \"This coupon actually had a typo on it and it should've read half off the second meal so I took care of it for you\". I wasn't sure exactly what his glib answer ...\"took care of it for you\" meant so I asked to see the coupon again and after reviewing it, asked him if we were getting the second meal for free as advertised and he said no it was a typo and the second meal would be half price. 
I asked to see the manager. 
The manager came over and asked for the coupon which I said I'd give her when we got our free meal as advertised. She said there was a typo, I said it's not our problem and we simply wanted our free meal as advertised. She seemed flummoxed but did come back with the revised check that reflected one meal being free.
As a 'local', I'd suggest if you're in the mood for Italian food in a relaxed atmosphere try Pasta Cucina at Boulder Station or the IAC on East Sahara near Eastern because at either place the service is better, the food is just as good or even better, the prices are better (read: cheaper) and there's no 'BAIT & SWITCH' going on. 
My prediction: If Mamma Olivia's keeps this egregious behavior up as their business model, they'll be out of business within 24 months.

{"text":"I left this restaurant a few hours ago, and I don't think I'll ever come back.

We split a 10\" pizza, and it was the most bland, flavorless pizza we've ever had. I only had 1.5 slices and just left the restaurant. If I can't finish more than two slices of a pizza, there's definitely something wrong. It was beyond undercooked like you have no idea.

There was also an older guy singing Frank Sinatra songs - and it was just horrible. He couldn't sing, period.

There's so many great Italian restaurants out in Vegas. Even though our waiter was cheerful and friendly, don't waste your time with this place."}
{"text":"So full! Alfredo sauce in the cheese wheel.... oh! We were all fighting for it. It was so gooood!"}
{"text":"Homemade pasta was fabulous! Calamari, delish. Very nice atmosphere, very new and not well known. Try it!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great friendly service. This area needs a restaurant like this.  Beef Carpaccio was so good and can almost be an entree by itself.  We had the Lasagna and the Linguini with clams.  We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"No Grazie

My favorite unfiltered dame  and I visited Mamma Olivia Saturday morning after replaying their cheese wheel video a few times online. 

Helpful Tip: The cheese wheel requires two guest minimum at $16 per person. You'll have to request it as well because its a secret menu item. 

We ordered the Alfredo pasta with (2) orders of shrimp +7.00
Fritto Misto $13 is definitely a must order, The calamari was fried perfectly and the broccoli and peppers were delightful. The Marinara definitely had a unique taste and really enjoyed it as well.

The table-side cheese wheel presentation looked like \"meal to remember\". Regrettably, the pasta was flavorless. I was completely underwhelmed. Ironically the additional shrimp arrived on a separate plate with additional Alfredo sauce (which we appreciated) and taste aaaaamazing! 

$60+ lunch for two

I'm \"curious\" about the scampi but we all know what happened to \"the cat'\" so I'll pass for now."}
{"text":"Mediocre!!! We ordered the pesto from the cheese wheel menu... not only they assigned someone new to work the wheel but my plate was super cold and messy. Not happy with the experience :("}
{"text":"Where do I start?! This place is now officially one of my favorite, go-to restaurants! My experience here was amazing and one of a kind thanks to Tucker and Rogelio who gave outstanding customer service! To top it off, the food was phenomenal! We had the flat bread as an appetizer and pesto penne as our entree, which was cooked to perfection and mixed in the cheese wheel by our wonderful and knowledgeable server, Tucker. I felt at home at this place, and I will (and already have) recommended it to friends and family! I can't wait to go again and try the other cheese wheel pastas! Customer service is always key when picking my fave restaurants, and if I could rate the customer service part more than 5-stars I would! Rogelio was very professional and had a great personality and gave us more insight about the restaurant along with Tucker. THANKS MAMMA OLIVIA for the great service and food!!!"}
{"text":"The food and the service were exceptional . I would give it 6 stars, if I could. We ordered the \"small\" plates, and still took food home. We already made reservations, for Valentines Day."}
{"text":"My oh my!  The food at Mama Olivia's will have you running to the Boulevard Mall again. 

The food is mind blowing amazing. I had the chicken Piccatta. It's the best in town! To the guy or gal in the kitchen.. high five! I literally finished the entire dish by myself. I ate the whole thing like I was going away to prison. 

The portion was perfect. 2 Chicken breasts topped with capers bathing in lemony buttery sauce. On the side, plenty of fresh steamed veggies (to make you feel as if you are being healthy) with 2 small mashed potato volcanos. I was in heaven. 

My husband enjoyed the lasagna. The sauce though! DELICIOUS! You can surely tell everything coming out of that kitchen is made from scratch. The cheese was still bubbling when the lasagna arrived at our table. My husband licked the bowl clean. 

The calamari is great since it's accompanied by a sauce base like the lasagna. It's light and flavorful. 

Don't judge this place (Boulevard Mall) by it's location. The mall is making a comeback and I can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Mamma Olivia is a great restaurant and it is centrally located. The last time I was there I ordered the cheese wheel. The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere is extremely pleasant. I highly recommend checking this place out for a quick beer and some pasta or a date night."}
{"text":"Decided to take my mom here for an early Mother's Day dinner after reading the reviews and seeing it an add on IG. 
Service: 3/5 our waiter was nice but we had to ask for too many things such as salt and pepper, butter (which he said they were out of due to a busy weekend)

Food: 3.5/5 the food was overall good. We ordered the the calamari for an appetizer which was good, the main course me and my fiancé had was the pasta served table side in a cheese wheel. It seemed more of a gimmick than anything but it tasted good, the waiter topped it with prosciutto which he crumbled with his bare hand which kind of threw me off but I went with it. The meatballs we ordered as well had a canned taste to them and the sauce was just blah. 

Overall 3.5 since I can't select a half star I'll just round up.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go again, but if I got invited I wouldn't say no per se'."}
{"text":"I admit it, I am an Italian food snob.  I grew up eating  in Italian restaurants in NYC's Little Italy; I studied Italian cooking in culinary schools in America ad Europe; cooked in restaurants in Rome and Naples, was a chef for 40 yrs, etc. Yea, I KNOW when it is good, mediocre  or bad. Mamma Olivia' secret restaurant on the Maryland Parkway blew us away. The bread is made and baked on the premises. The pasta is made fresh in front of you. The calamari is fried FRESH - not precooked sitting under a heat lamp. It is real calamari - NOT THOSE  CARDBOARD FROZEN RINGS.  The chef is Italian- from Italy-. Instead of spending $100 for mediocre food at the big name Strip places, come to  Mamma Olivia's for the real deal.  Chef Bob at the Turnberry."}
{"text":"Mama Olivia restaurant has the best food my favorite sandwich is Panino Capri it's the licious and if you're looking for great drinks and great atmosphere you need to stop by mamma Olivia. The service is great... Josh Talia or Tucker..."}
{"text":"beautiful, amazing, good, delicious, original, authentic, classical, just how grandma used to make, wonderful, 11/10."}
{"text":"Are you looking for a good food just go to bulevard mall al Mamma Olivia . We started with bruschetta tosted italian bread chopped fresh tomato with garlic basil in extravergine d'oliva oil and parmigian cheese on top very good. Antipasto misto big plate with mix prosciutto salami mortadella and pecorino romano and fresh mozzarella fantastic. My g.f had Alfredo was delicious with a touch of swiss cream cheese and parmigian . We enjoyed cheese will pasta alla matriciana so amazing. The big portion and full of spaghetti flavored with pancetta prosciutto and pecorino romano in top.... I remember this matriciana eat only in Rome two years ago yummy...! Our server told us the chef Marco is Toscano from Florence Italy. Mamma Olivia is a little Florence in Las Vegas  !"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here with my boyfriend! It's a beautiful restaurant, with great service, and delicious food! We ordered the gnocchi alla bolognese and the penne alla pesto! Both were amazing and fresh! Our server Josh was friendly and attentive! I highly recommend this place for date night, parties, or a casual evening meal! The bar is also a great place to sit and have a drink with your dinner! Thank you, Mamma Olivia!"}
{"text":"Breakfast? Mama makes it right. Great place to stop in and enjoy, great staff and very tasty menu, add it to your list."}
{"text":"I normally don't edit my reviews but after the restaurant reached out and explained what happened and said that opentable has been updated about their hours, I really want to give them another chance.  I didn't get to experience the food but their customer service is excellent and very responsive.  Thank you again Catherine!  You will see us soon."}
{"text":"Coworkers took me to this wonderful restaurant. Friendly people and great food.  for the pork Milanese. I will definitely be back whenever I'm in town."}

Something you will never forget!!! 5 star experience!!!"}
{"text":"I found this place while looking at my Instagram.
I had no idea it was at the mall. It is very nice inside.  A nice man sat us at our table. 
I wanted to try the cheese wheel pasta because I am a cheese-aholic. But it was not on the menu. So when he came to take our order I asked about it. He said it was $16 per person and we both had to order it. We could add sides of chicken or meatballs. We chose to do the side of meatballs. It was also a choice of fettuccine noodles or spaghetti noodles. We chose fettuccine. It is served with Alfredo sauce and they bring the cheese wheel to your table, Flambeau it table side add the pasta in the cheese wheel and mix. Presentation is fun but the taste was less than expected. I guess I had really high hopes that it would be this incredible cheesy bite after bite but it wasn't.  I barely even tasted the cheese, all I could taste was Alfredo. Then the meatballs.... the marinara sauce was good but the meatballs had lack of flavor and tasted boiled. Was not impressed at all and for 3 VERY small balls it was $5. We each had a cesar salad, pasta, meatballs and a soda and our bill was almost $80.00. (For the area of town i dont think they will be in business long wuth these prices)I also left feeling unsatisfied and definitely not full. The pasta serving for 2 was enough for 1 person to eat. 
Their bread however was amazing. Fresh, hot, thinly sliced and whatever the oil and vinegar brand that they use was so incredibly tasty! The bread and oil and vinegar is why I gave it 3 stars.
I had high hopes and left feeling badly that we cheated on our regular Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"I was super excited to check this place out after seeing it advertised so much on FB & my IG feed but it definitely let me down.

We got the #cheesewheelpasta (just tasted like fettuccine alfredo), #pennealavodka (okay) & a kid's buttered pasta with cheese (so bland & there was no cheese, just the parmesan sprinkled on top).  

The server did tell us that they were on their last wheel (a new one was being delivered) & that there wasn't that much cheese left 

I'm so sad Salute Trattoria Italiana (located inside Red Rock Casino) closed  They had the best Cheese Wheel Pasta & their Kid's Mac N Cheese was the best I ever had."}
{"text":"When looking for Mexican seafood but stumbled upon a great find
The food was amazing and the service was
phenomenal 
Had the pasta de mare delicious and the New York steak 
Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Thalia was our waitress, she was so nice and so helpful. The food was great. We recommend the ravioli (sausage and also butternut squash) we also got the chicken Alfredo which was great. Mg son got the cheese pizza and loved it. Will recommend it for anyone and will be coming back."}
{"text":"We stopped in on this spot as we were getting some glasses made at the mall and what a gem!  The service and quality isn't something you'd normally expect from a a \"mall eatery.\"  Make no mistake, this restaurant is for real. 

From the time we walked in, we were greeted warmly and promptly seated. The staff worked well together to ensure we felt like values customers and explained the options available. Our server, Thalia, was great!  She took some time to understand our preferences and her recommendations were on point. 

As for the food, the portions were generous and delicious, so come hungry. I had the lasagna and it is one of my favorites so I'm pretty particular.  Absolutely no complaints. My wife had a pizza and we ended up having to take half of it home!

Bottom line:  this is a relatively new spot in town and it deserves our business. In a town primarily based on customer service, there is a new player!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Super super bummed! Went Saturday evening around 4pm. Not busy at all maybe 4 tables including ourselves. Drove out from Boulder City just to try this place as I saw this place on my IG and could not wait to try the cheese wheel. Like others have stated they don't let the cheese flambé long enough so there really is no cheese. The Alfredo sauce/ noodles were pretty plain. The bread was amazing the service was terrible. Short staffed....one man show and don't expect refills. Felt very uncomfortable asking for anything. Table behind us had appetizers and drinks comped because their dinner was taking so long. They left before eating their dinner. I'm glad the the VGK game was on to occupy us while waiting. Definitely need to hire some servers. I was really hoping to love this place as it looked so delicious. Crème brûlée was yummy but the cannolis not so much. Such a bummer really. Hopefully they can pull it together. I wanted to love it but I didn't."}
{"text":"My wife and I were first time patrons to this restaurant. As soon as we walked in, Josh, the Manager, greeted us like he'd known us forever. What a pleasant surprise. The restaurant atmosphere was very relaxing, and conducive to enjoy a nice dinner. Once seated, our waiter, Tucker, gave us the same reception as Josh. The food was outstanding, and just the right portions for us. Our dining was one of utmost pleasure, and Josh and Tucker didn't know what to do for us. We will definitely be back, and tell all our friends about this outstanding find."}
{"text":"I first stumbled upon this place on IG. So many people were posting the amazing looking cheese wheel including the restaurant itself. I was mesmerized by that cheese wheel. They light a giant cheese wheel on fire, then toss pasta in it and mix it around and around collecting chunks of cheese to your past dish. Getting your pasta extra cheesy and flavorful. So I added this place on my list. I got my brother interested in this place too so when he came to visit, we took the fam bam on a Sunday afternoon. They had a lady doing karaoke off youtube and a laptop. Different. So me and my brother get the cheese wheel since it is a 2 person min at $16/pp. Kids get pasta pomodoro and kids meatball spaghetti. My niece got invited up to sing, so she sang \"Let it go\". She's 5. So kids food came then the cheese wheel rolled out. They poured olive oil on the cheese wheel, lit it on fire and started massaging the cheese, spreading the fire around a bit. Finally the server dumped the fettuccine alfredo into the wheel, mixed it up real good, and served it. They were decent size servings, the bowl looked small actually but it was a nice sized dish. I swear I ate and ate and ate and it didn't even look like I touched my bowl. We all dined down on our dishes and waited for the server to get togo boxes and the check. The food was mediocre, to be honest experiencing the cheese wheel wasn't as exciting as I thought it was going to be. The presentation was eh. I've dined in many Italian restaurants and tasted phenomenal Italian food. While this place wasn't the worst, it isn't enough for me to travel to Boulevard Mall to eat pasta. Sorry if I busted anyone's bubbles. If if would make you feel any better mine deflated very slowly as I ate my food."}
{"text":"Not sure why there are so many 5 star reviews? Let's be honest here, this place is terrible. Went here for a lunch meeting with my team and a few of us got sick. The lobster ravioli lacked flavor and some pieces were chewy and some where just rubbery and over cooked. Some of the Calamari were the same. Some co workers had salmon and they said it was extremely over cooked as well. I don't think the chef knew the difference between cooked to under cooked to over cooked. They brought out our entrees first when we ordered appetizers too. I'm sorry but for the prices they charge and how bad the food is,  please please save your money and stomach from here and go to Olive Garden or Maggianos."}
