{"text":"I went here with my beau and we shared the jerk chicken roti which was the best jerk chicken I've had at a restaurant so far. It had just the right amount of spice. The goat chicken was delicious as well. The ginger beer was very good quality. I don't really like to dance, so I don't think I was go there for the dancing, but I would go there for the food."}
{"text":"If you want a bit of island flava infused into a ho hum day, go to Groovy's.  Chances are, you will be greeted by the restaurant's namesake himself.  On top of serving up some of the finest curries and jerk in the city, he entertains the regulars every Sunday night from 5-9 pm by vivaciously tooting his trombone.  He and his jazz band are a real treat, playing standards, funk tunes, and originals to boot.  Downing a generous portion of curry beef on rice, with a few mouthfuls of green salad and fried plantains on the side, while enjoying some live music is one of my favourite \"hidden gems\" in the city."}
{"text":"Awesome place. I had the jerk chicken roti, and it was excellent. The plantains on the side are so good. It's a very casual environment though, so don't expect a fancy restaurant where you wear a really nice clothes(fancy dresses, tuxs, etc) or anything. It's a great group/family hangout where you get great food and a calm, relaxing atmosphere. I love spicy food and the jerk chicken roti was very spicy for me, in a good way. It isn't watered down fake spice. I've become a vegetarian now, so I look forward to coming back to enjoy a jerk chicken roti, minus the chicken of course, along with some delicious plantains and some ginger beer. Mmmmm."}
{"text":"I went in towards the end of lunch time and the place was empty. When I asked them what was available I was told the only thing ready was chicken roti, either jerk or curry style. Since it's a roti place that is what I had planned to get regardless so I wasn't too disappointed. 

The food only took a few minutes to prepare but unfortunately when the wrap came it was all a bit underwhelming. It wasn't huge and at just over $10 I expected a bit more. I did enjoy the jerk flavouring which was just the right amount of hot, however as strange as it sounds for a roti shop, the roti itself was average at best. It wasn't very fresh and had a bit of a grainy texture that was off putting. 

Since the menu is pretty limited even during the best of times, I'm not planning on a trip back."}
