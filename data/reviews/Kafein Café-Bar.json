{"text":"Kafein's food is good but coffee not so good; however, they make a mean cup of mocha. I really liked their squash soup, and the size was pretty generous for a small. Not sure if they bake their own pastries, but their croissants were delicious. 

Every time I've gone my wifi was unreliable, but if you don't need wifi, the space is actually pretty nice. Its got the right balance of coziness with quite a bit of space."}
{"text":"Un café tranquille et confortable pour la lecture ou de détente.
I enjoyed the relaxing and quiet vibe of this cafe to recharge after a visit to the fine art museum. Almond milk latte, sofas downstairs, and mellow lighting. Lovely."}
{"text":"This is my preferred on-campus cafe for studying. Located directly across from the Webster library, it is a less uptight option than the silent library. Staffed by a crew of seemingly lovely and cool folks, this place always has a fun soundtrack, so much so that I never wear my headphones while there. The upstairs is the \"cafe\" section, with the counter where you order and lots of small tables which are ideal for individual study with a hot cup of tea (their tea selection is very tasty, btw). Downstairs is the \"lounge area\" with it's cushy \"shabby chic\" couches and larger tables for groups. It' here that they host their nighttime events. The menu of the place is really creative and jam-packed and the prices are in tune with the portions.  It is true that their veg options are less numerous than their meat options and their vegan options are.... Well I am not sure if there are any, but what I have eaten there is absolutely delish! My fav is the haloumi sandwich, by far. I highly recommend it, especially on a rainy day."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. We had to beg for cutlery way after our food arrived. 
Food was Ok(not great)  but the service ruined the experience."}
{"text":"Last night, my friend and I were looking for a casual place for a drink so we headed to Kafein on Bishop. I was not aware that this café by day turns to a bar by night. As I entered the bar, I was immediately taken by the cosy, home-like vibe. The décor was lovely. With its Red walls, the lights dimmed, and red velvet chairs, Kafein is made attractive and welcoming. I ordered a Mojito. Served in a mason jar for 10$, I was satisfied with my choice. I would recommend this place for a date. Though the music became increasingly louder as the night progressed, Kafein maintains a romantic atmosphere, which in turn makes you at ease and relaxed."}
{"text":"My only complaint about Kafein is the obnoxiously loud rave music they often have blaring in the middle of the day. The food is delicious, they have a fantastic tea selection, and the staff are friendly and competent. I get that it's a bar in the evening, but it presents itself as a welcoming place for students to study during the day, so why blast music that no one could possibly concentrate to?"}
{"text":"Love hanging out at this place. They have a great atmosphere. Upstairs is a cafe, and downstairs is a lounge. I usually go to the lounge in the evening. During the day, I sometimes hold meetings with friends.

Been going here for several months, and my week isn't complete unless I go there once."}
{"text":"Food: they offer a variety of coffees, smoothies and drinks for 5a7!! Also pastries and sandwiches are available~ we got regular coffee, well brewed~

Service: friendly, lay back

Price: reasonable for coffee

Ambiance: bonus++ vintage retro feel, upstairs is more industrial style and fairly big space. Downstairs is more like a lounge bar feel, like in ur best friend's basement with couches and long wooden table. Most clientele is from Concordia~"}
{"text":"Ok place, atmosphere is nice, couches are 70's basment...ok shisha"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place! The upstairs is a coffee shop with great food and lemonades, the downstairs is a dimly lit bar with couches and a cozy atmosphere. The music they play is great and the coffee is delicious! Would definitely recommend Kafein to everyone!"}
{"text":"Love that spot and try to hit it whenever I am in town, whether to get a (good) cup of coffee or specialty tea or a stronger drink in the evening in the downstairs bar. Caught some pretty nice DJ sets as well in the cosy space. Good service, good drinks, there are few places like this in this part of Montreal..Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I've visited a few more times during the day in the past few weeks, and the music has been much more palatable. The staff has actively kept the volume at an appropriate level, and genre-wise they've leaned away from angry grunge and toward jazzy pop, which makes for a much more pleasant ambiance."}
{"text":"I've gone to Kafein for lunch, a quick coffee, a snack, an energy smoothie and drinks. Each time I went, I was not disappointed. The food was fresh, whole! It did not taste like packaged food. 

My advice is to try their Chai Latte or brownie smoothie for a healthy treat. Oh & their drinks, pleasantly strong & delicious. The staff is nice, too!"}
{"text":"Decent vib with live djs. Can't say the sheesha is anything spectacular though. Limited flavours and only moderately clean hookahs."}
{"text":"Superb cafe right next to Concordia campus that's perfect for a quick lunch, a study area (especially downstairs), a quick delicious drink or a relaxing weekend with poetry readings on Saturday & Sunday. Basically, they have it all! The half panini + soup combo is under $10 which is a steal for a student like myself. The lavender, rosemary lemonade is deliciously tart and full of flavour, which is wonderful because many a-times lemonade is extremely watered down. Yes this may just be another \"artsy\" cafe that litters montreal, but the atmosphere and table arrangements create a comfortable stay, no matter what you're there for! Also, i read a past review that there used to be shisha and i'd love to see that return! It would be awesome!"}
{"text":"Stale pastries, dirty tables and a sea of laptops... what more could you want?"}
{"text":"Kafein is like that local place that feels comfortable and familiar. I love how it turns from a cafe on top to a cozy bar on the bottom. The coffee and drinks are both strong. It's the best place to sit and have a long chat on a rainy day. I would say if you are looking for a study spot, I would try elsewhere because the music and ambiance tends to be on the loud side. 


Tip: they often hold trivia on Weds nights, Karaoke and live music so check their fb page for events."}
{"text":"Kafein is a great little cozy chill hangout place!

I had the Salmon sandwich and it was very filling and yummy!

Only complain is the size and cleanliness of the washroom... 

It's the kind of place you'd go to and hog a comfy seat and sit on your laptop and surf all day (not that I do that) :/ 

- The lemon flavoured water was a nice touch!"}
{"text":"One of the best shisha spot in Montreal.  In a very relaxed ambiance. Monday jazz night and of corse Sunday night groove with Dj D. For a mixe of hip-hop and disco and oldies hit. Just amazin'"}
{"text":"Dear kafein,

I wanted to give you 5 stars, I miss your shisha days. You had the best vibes , comfy couches, dark ambiance, old school jams.  Why did you have to change? I don't really see the point of coming back to you now. I had some of the best times in your basement. Maybe i'll make a short visit and try one of your sandwiches upstairs."}
{"text":"Kafein, why do you hate vegans so much? There's like nothing on the menu I can eat since you changed it. And before, there was like, one item. What the heck happened to the vegie paté sandwich? Sandwiches on chewy white bread? White mayonaise pesto and cilantro and sautéd mushrooms? That's what I make at my house when I'm lazy... Puh-leaze... Accompanied with chips? Again: puh-leaze...  How about a thick vegetable stew once in awhile (curry mushroom-kale or potatoe-bean or lentil-carrot) or some vegan cookies... I gave my vegan baker friend your business card and she got excited and went by and spoke to you then called and you never called her back.

And I wish you'd turn it around, Kafein, cause truth be told, you're not a bad place. Your downstairs is comfortable and you've got a well-stoked bar and I like your bathrooms though the urinals are set way too high, and I'm like what, 5'11''? You've got good djs and you don't come down hard on the nice homeless fella who hangs around outside though so many other establishments would - and that's kind of ya.

But come on... vegan it up for the rest of us, will ya?"}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere to really just let yourself go after a day's work.

The interior is non traditional with sofas and couches scattered all over. When i was there, they were playing Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) on a project. The place in all its entirety is one word: hip. The lounge style interior makes the place look super chill.

The cocktails are bar standard expensive. $9-$12. But they are REALLY good. Mostly original mixes.

A must go if you want to indulge in the amateur art culture."}
{"text":"Before the flood happened -x- months ago, the downstairs area of Kafein looked super cool, vintage, and mysterious. Now it's lost its charm, however, that's not their fault. We can put it on mother nature... for now.

I've come here for drinks, I've come here for small bites, I've come here for coffee, and I have never left unsatisfied. I wouldn't say this is my favourite place to go, but it's not a bad place to go either. 

Most recently, I came here with a hangover, and their Ginger-Thyme Lemonade cured my ailing stomach! The ginger was strong, the thyme added a nice touch, and the lemonade was sweet'ish. I'm going to make this at home from now on, and when I'm too lazy, I'm going to walk on over and order one... or two. I love it."}
{"text":"It's just your average little café,cute but nothing special. Little place with lots of sun. They decided to play a story on the speakers rather than music. It was annoying, loud and really odd. Once they decided to put music it was pretty loud. The food and drinks smelt good reasonably priced as well. Just a convenient place for Concordia students to go too. But I wouldn't meet up for projects or study sessions etc considering it's a little hard to hear."}
{"text":"Go to a Concordia poetry reading here and enjoy the excellent sangria that they make especially for you. Try their excellent cocktails as well. An impeccable and creative menu."}
{"text":"Kaffein to me is what Central Perk was in Friends. Whenever I have breaks at school, I don't even have to contemplate where to go. It's always Kaffein!! 

The staff is friendly and have a style that matches the place."}
{"text":"The place doesn't look like much from the street but it's quite spacious inside. Good selection of sandwiches, and even a half-portion came with a little slaw salad and chips. Great!"}
{"text":"It's an adorable place. So I am continuing my journey with passport barista and I get to stop here. From outside, you will never be able to guess that this cafe is huge from inside. Nice decor with painting hanging on the brick walls. The place is very cozy, I am sure students from Concordia will appreciate this place to hangout and study. The service is very friendly. I got a cold latte; the caffeine is kicking well. I also got the most delicious cookie made with two of my favorite ingredients: white chocolate and pistachios.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I went to this place looking for a sandwich around lunchtime. I ordered a veggie panini for takeout for my drive home. This is a pretty laid back looking place with small tables, large enough for a laptop and a plate. They had lots of kinds of tea and coffee available and also a wide variety of snack items like croissants and brownies. There seems to be a downstairs that is more lounge style with couches but I didn't go down there to see. The sandwich I ordered came with some chips and a carrot salad. The chips were identical to Miss Vickie's original chips and the carrot salad was sour tasting... The salad also made my sandwich soggy in the box. The sandwich itself was tasty but the bread was really dry on the sides because the veggies were all piled in the middle. Overall, it was okay... I might go back to see if they have anything better to offer."}
{"text":"The coffee isn't half bad.  Semi-affordable, too.  Not really any vegan food.  But every experience I've had here has been tainted by some unwanted, Larry David-esque situation.  The first time I ever ordered coffee here, I asked for a black coffee to go.  The barista filled up a mug and gave it to me.  I said, \"No, I asked for it to go.\"  The girl gave me the look of bullets - it's the same look MPs give to the one rogue MP in their party who votes against a motion to pass legislation to build new orphanages or something - and aggressively transferred the mug's contents into a cup.

I imagined her interview to get that job:  \"Let's role-play a scenario here.  What would you do if a customer ordered something and you accidentally made them the wrong thing?\"

\"Oh, I would get mad about it and look at them as if they were Luka Magnotta's accomplice.  I would want them to just accept whatever I made them and go about their day.\"

\"You're hired!\"

I went back there again recently while it was pretty dead, and the barista kept talking to a friend of hers who was visiting.  She ignored the people in front of me for a few minutes to maintain the conversation, and after she got to them, she went back to talk to the friend again for a few minutes before taking my order.  And before I got in that line, I had started thinking positive things like life is awesome and worth living.  Now I don't anymore because you thought you'd make me wait so that you could talk about bands with your friend.  Please plaster a smile on your face, even the fakest of fakes, and serve me when I get to the counter please.  I have a life too and I want to talk to my friends for many minutes as well.

The coffee tasted good."}
{"text":"Cute coffee shop/bar near Concordia U, it a nice coffee to study and work in. The music they play is pretty awesome and touches many plethora of style. The internet connection was solid, and the chairs are relatively comfortable.

The coffee is awesome, I've had a cappuccino, which had  and a cortado, and they were both excellent. I didn't order any alcoholised drink but they were decently priced. 

Would return to work."}
{"text":"This is a cool place, and the ice tea here is really good. We got some chicken sandwiches with salad while waiting for the next Fantasia screening. The salad came with a tasty sundried tomato dressing. Normally, I hate dressing, but this was really good. Thanks for partnering with Fantasia to give fans and fest pass holders a break on meals. However, for the girl at the counter who can't do math, give her a calculator so we get the right percentage off. Otherwise, yum!"}
{"text":"Possibly my new favourite café/lunch place downtown Montreal - less crammed than some of the others. I had a fabulous fried haloumi sandwich. I'm pretty fussy about my hot drinks, and had a chai latté that was just so-so, but I'd go back and try the espresso-based drinks to see if they're better. The staff was super easy-going and friendly, the atmosphere chill, and the décor clean and fresh, while also warm and comfortable. They have exhibition opportunities for artists, and are pretty open about what they'll exhibit. Great vibe. Check it out."}
{"text":"I loved this place for many reasons. First off it's close to Concordia university. It was such a struggle getting to this place because of the road blocks from the construction happening. We walked past it and had to come back because the signs weren't clear, but it was worth it. 

It's two floors where the basement is an actual bar. The cafe/bar has a very warm environment with wood decor including tables and chairs. 

I was with a friend and we both ordered our drinks and a light lunch. I had an iced latte, my friend a chai latte. I had their cheese sandwich which was served with chips and a small salad. The sandwich was very filling and excellent. I enjoyed my drink as well. My friend asked if she could have a breakfast options even though it was quite late afternoon but they were totally okay with it. They have a decent selection to choose from for breakfast/lunch. 

After we finished our meal we sat in the basement. It was a calm place as everyone was working on their laptops or studying. There is also an option to sit outside with cute tables and chairs and flower centrepieces. It was pouring rain so we chose to stay indoors."}
{"text":"Kafein is a great café and bar option in the Guy-Concordia / Peel area. 

Their lattés are consistently great, but the mocha is also worth a try! Their food options are light, tasty, and made with fresh ingredients. The decor is very different upstairs vs. downstairs. The upstairs is fairly neat (exposed brick, industrial stools), whereas the basement is more dimly lit and intimate. As for their bar, they have a fairly creative cocktail menu that is worth trying and a pretty active roster of DJ events, poetry nights, etc."}
{"text":"I really like this cafe/bar, for starters, the downstairs is cute and has a live DJ which is fun, and the setting is cozy (some rips in the couches but still cute vintage feel), their plates are super antique looking fine china, which only adds to the vintage feel, which adds to the charm. The best part, aside from the romantic lighting and feel, is the happy hour because their amazing drinks are cheap (~$7 for super fancy drinks), they come in really fun glasses - the mojito, which is my favourite, comes in a mason jar mug and has brown rock sugar at the bottom and LOTS of fresh mint, it tastes amazing.. probably my favourite mojito in the city thus far. 

Although I wouldn't come here for dinner, the food is fresh and has lots of fun ingredients, I think the presentation is nice and definitely worth trying something if you're hungry. 

My only major complaint is that the bathrooms didn't smell good and they were so tiny..but I'm not sure if they have nicer bathrooms upstairs.

Only giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the slightly ripped couches and the tiny bathrooms downstairs.. I know it's part of the charm, but I think they would be better off replacing them or throwing a blanket over top.. but happy hour drinks and ambiance.. would have otherwise won them 5 stars"}
{"text":"Great coffee shop! Creative and inspiring vibe! 
Love coming here for a cup of coffee, tea or their awesome duck salad!"}
{"text":"In my opinion the drinks here are great but nothing fancy. A very typical little cafe with some nice decor. (to be honest, not a big fan of the random sofas and chairs downstairs that look like they're older than you but I can see why some would like it) The staff are friendly and the prices are reasonable. 

Overall, a great place to study and escape the summer heat!"}
{"text":"Un endroit simple avec des airs de cantine, où l'on se pose pour un café avec des amis."}
{"text":"La qualité des ingrédients est indéniables. Le menu est simple et savoureux. A smooth tasty soup and a fluffy salad with a tasty vinaigrette that doesn't kill the greens! Rare and appreciated. Great teas and coffee.
I come here often now."}
{"text":"I'm here almost every Wednesday for their trivia night. Always a good time! Everyone who works here is super nice. My friends and I usually get a pitcher of sangria which is $20 before tax and tip for a decently large pitcher. Overall, cool vibe downstairs and lots of cool events most nights."}
{"text":"Used to love coming here - the food is great, baristas are always very friendly. However, the owner is extremely rude and disrespectful to customers. I have seen him make people cry, and feel entitled about it. As someone who has worked in customer service, I get how hard it can be - but I don't think this was called for. I won't be coming back anymore because there are just so many other equally good options nearby where I don't have to experience that hostility. As a side note, it's also pretty expensive for what you're getting"}
{"text":"My friends and I popped in her for a few drinks, not knowing what to expect.  Great vibe: coffee, couches, drinks, dj, sheesha.  We didn't smoke, but like the others there (young crowd--Concordians?) who did, we had a great time.  Loved the decor, which included bird-cage lamps with paper shadow cut-outs of birds.  The music--kind of an avante-garde electronique thing--was right up my alley.  Bartenders were super-friendly and even poured us a 'thank you' drink on the house as we were about to leave.  

I'd kill for a place like this in Boston, but then the line would be out the door and around the corner, and the staff wouldn't be as friendly.  Guess I'll just keep visiting MTL.

Unexpectedly, one of my favorite random finds in a city that has many to offer."}
