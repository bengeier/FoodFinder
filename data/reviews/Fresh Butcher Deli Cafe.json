{"text":"This organic butcher / deli / coffee shop is unique and as its name implies features FRESH ingredients. I have been a couple of times and pleased with the service, pricing and quality of products. I bought one of the pastries on my last visit and it was awesome. The butcher carries standard meats like chicken, beef and pork but some rather unique meat sources as well. Check it out!!!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I had my deer processes here. The staff was very friendly. The deer came back quickly and clean. The jerky, smokey, and sausages where the best I have had. I highly recommend \"Fresh Butcher Deil Cafe\" to anyone and I will be bringing any of my future hunt here"}
{"text":"Have been hearing from a friend of mine to check this place out for a long time.  Finally stopped in, love it!!!  Defiantly give it a shot, I preferred everything that we got over that other sausage place in Old Brooklyn, or anything at the big building in Ohio city!  (you know what I mean)  brought home bison bacon, Slovenian sausages, pork tenderloin , and smokies!!!  Have also had lamb chops, and their fresh cut steaks at a friends house, just didn't pick any up on our first visit.  (way too cold for me to be grilling!!)

Will  recommend over the places I used to frequent!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer:  I haven't actually been here.  I am giving 5 stars  because that's their current average rating, and I don't want to change it.

I was a little confused about what this place is from reading the reviews and visiting their website.  It wasn't clear to me whether it was a deli for take-out only, or also a restaurant with tables to eat-in.  So I called.  They do have a sandwich menu and some tables for people to sit and eat.  But they don't have any high chairs, which is why I opted not to go."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place!!  I have been coming here for years, everything is delicious, and Mike puts his whole heart into his business!  I won't go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Wanted to add something to my recent review. Fresh had something available which may be unique to them: Dork sausage. Yes, Dork sausage. For a second I thought you had to be a Reddit (which I love, btw) reading gamer to buy it, but, no, it's their concoction of pork and duck. And it's SERIOUSLY delish. Actually, couldn't believe how good it was. 

Just one more reason why we love Fresh."}
{"text":"I ordered a half a hog from them, with a 2 week lead time.  They did not inform me that they would not have it until the day it was supposed to completely butchered and ready.  This left me in a bind because I then could not do anything at the last minute.  

They told me they order a week ahead, and have the hog for several days before it is butchered.  How can they wait until the last minute to inform the customer, that they will not fulfill their order?"}
{"text":"Great local butcher.  They have amazing homemade sausages.  I am a big fan of there chorizo.  They will also cut anything to specification.  I like thick cut meats and they always cut it fresh for me.  After only a few visits they all remember me and know exactly what I like. To me the service couldn't get any better.  During the summer they grill out on Saturdays.  Try the kielbasa burger.  It is pretty amazing."}
