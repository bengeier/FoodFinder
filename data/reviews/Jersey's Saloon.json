{"text":"Enjoyable, but of a less than tasteful crowd but hey! I can't ask for miracles in a bar that condones fire bar strippers. Good chicken wings and cheap spirits. Music got better as the night went on and the mechanical bull was quite fun. Good looking staff with decent service!"}
{"text":"first off, there could have been a decent concept here but many points are missing. service was lousy. with all the hype you figure they would have better organized the concept. basically it is an overpriced corner bar. same old patrons same lousy drinks just well designed ......for now!! no signature cocktails nor a barmaid that nows how to make a decent drink. a simple rum and coke was way to strong... not that I'm complaining because I like strong but not a classic rum and coke. place was barely full and the barmaids seem inexperienced in bartending and entertainment . and count your bottles because the spillage was enormous. I went in there thinking great let's see this concept that is new to here but it is far from original. will never go again. clean up your concept add decent bottles on the wall and hire staff that now how to entertain and make a drink!!!"}
{"text":"Formerly Maz bar, Jersey's Saloon opened last week.    Everyone was talking about the Coyote Ugly style dancing girls and we had to see it for ourselves.    We went at breakfast on Saturday morning.   The girls were lovely  and the outfits actually covered a lot more of the body than we had expected - this is no strip joint, folks!   Decor is US midwestern and terrific - the bras over the bar added a cute touch.    Service - honestly, the girls were very, very nice.   The place had only been open a week or so, so training on the cash was underway with one of them, but that's no big deal.    The regular breakfast menu was not yet available so we chose from the regular menu. He had the bacon cheeseburger (huge, fresh, deliciously seasoned, tons of bacon), I had the flank steak and eggs (fresh, delicious, beautifully presented....but only one egg instead of two).      The drinks....cheap - $5 per drink (vodka, gin, rum, etc). They have happy hour from 4-7 pm where drinks are $4 - hard to complain!  I love this style of place for Sherbrooke Street in NDG - I think it brings lots of fun to the neighbourhood which is already eclectic. We weren't there for the show but we'll go back on a Thursday or Friday night for that - also, I can't wait to ride the mechanical bull!"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. I had two pints from their taps and am still feeling sick two days later. Clean your damn pipes and don't serve disgusting food. Don't expect much from a dive bar."}
{"text":"Since I'm on a low-star review roll today I might as well get around to this review that I've been putting off forever. I tried to like this place, I really did. I was hoping that it would turn out to be the Chez Serge of NDG, but in reality it was more successful as Maz Bar than it will ever be as Jersey's Saloon. It was supposed to be a \"coyote ugly\" bar, but the management spent more time and money training the girls to do choreography than how to pour a beer. Literally, the barmaids poured their first beers ever on opening night. They received zero training. Every time I drive by now the place is a ghost town; I haven't seen more than 3 people sitting in the bar at any given time in the last 6 months. I went with a group of friends once and sat at the bar. We had a great time but only because I knew the girls that were working and because we'd already gotten pretty smashed at another bar. A few weeks later I walked in sober for a \"wild night\" with about 20 friends. We couldn't get service if our life depended on it. They wouldn't serve us at the table, even if we were eating, which meant that if you needed a water refill, another beer, missing a fork - anything - that we needed to get up and go to the bar where the bored workers were chatting amongst themselves. The food was terrible, the beer is overpriced, the atmosphere is just sad since the energy isn't there, and the service is non existent. If you're looking for a place for a private meeting, this bar is for you. I don't understand how you can fully renovate one of the only bars in NDG and still noone wants to come in."}
