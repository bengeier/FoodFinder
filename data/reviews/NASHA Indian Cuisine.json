{"text":"This place is awesome!  We went in with our kids (age 6 & 8), and had a wonderful experience.  The chef even came out to talk with us about what the kids liked, and he made a dish specifically for them - above and beyond, in my opinion.  The food was delicious - we had lamb vindaloo, chicken masala, the mixed bread basket, and a chicken dish for the kids.  Our kids also had a mango/yogurt drink that they loved.  The waitress even gave them a sample of another such drink from the menu so they could try it too.  We love this place - highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Best Indian place in Vally for me! Awesome curry and nice service."}
{"text":"The restaurant is under new management (as of late 2013, I believe). The ridiculously slow service is solved by a well-stocked buffet.  The food on the buffet was all fresh with lots of vegetarian options for people who are into that. The naan is made fresh and brought to the table after you sit down.   Unfortunately nothing was particularly great. It was good, just not something I would go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Food at nasha is good.However, they are very bad at serving food on time.The sad part was we had to wait for very long expecting chicken biryani but in vain.I experienced it each time I went there. No intentions to go back."}
{"text":"Poor service, reheated food- never again! We wanted to order dosas but the dosa maker was out. Then our meal arrived with cold flat pooris and reheated package bhatooras."}
{"text":"Went for the buffet. The butter chicken was not good at all. They bought my bread as I was standing at the cashier. There were other customers who got there bread right away. I think the water came from the garden hose. It was warm no ice and tasted awful. The only reason I gave it one star is because you can't give it zero stars."}
{"text":"Did not pass the upset stomach/diarrhea test."}
{"text":"great indian restaurant. we tried their unlimited dosa offer and it was real. We ordered andhra kara dosa, masala dosa  and rava dosa and they were all authentic and delicious. Its a must go indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Wednesday night dinner with the wife. Chicken Vindaloo with basmati rice and naan. Mmmmm delicious! Best in town and the Hot chai tea is a perfect compliment to the spicy vindaloo."}
{"text":"Went for the buffet today and was amazed again at how awesome the food is.  The butter chicken is addictive and you can't just have one serving.  The goat curry was great and I don't even like goat!  We came here for the Valentine's Day special menu last month and liked the creative dishes.  On top of all that, the staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Best lunch buffet I've had in the valley. It's hard to find a good mix of North and South Indian cuisine, but this buffet did a good job of it.   The chicken biryani, butter chicken, dosa, naan, palek paneer, vada and kheer were all excellent. On top of that, all the dishes actually packed a decent amount of spice, which is rare.  All that for $8.99, and you have a winner. My tummy tells me that I'll be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Awesome food ! Loved the food and the waiters and chef are so humble and courteous .... We ordered dal it was amazing and the basket of breads had some real yummy nans. It has a variety !!! A must visit place I would reckon"}
{"text":"Very bad service. Total disappointment after waiting for a biriyani more than an hour and later they say no food. No value for the customer's. Chats were yuck, dosa's are good. Chicken biriyani is 1/4 th quantity of what other restaurant's serve. I dont see why they say unlimitted dinner buffet when they can give us only one serving. If you think you would be really hungry please be at Nasha at 5pm to get 2 servings of food at 9pm."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet.  Nice decor, and really lovely dishes and set up for the buffet.  The server was friendly and quick to bring me my water.  Sadly the positives end there.  The options for the food weren't anything to get excited about, with many of the hot dishes sitting empty.  The butter chicken I had was tasty, but the chicken tikka was dry (they used chicken breast).  Also, they had a delicious zucchini dish but it was barely lukewarm when it should have been hot.  The garlic naan was very good but it took a long time for them to bring it to the table (I appreciate that they want to make it fresh but when you're half way through your meal by the time it comes it's a little too slow).  The shocker came with the bill.  $10.99 for the lunch buffet.  Really?  For limited options and not that amazing of food, kind of a disappointment.  There are plenty of really awesome Indian lunch buffets that are $8.99 that I will be going to instead (I know it's only $2 but it just wasn't that great). Meh."}
{"text":"Worst management !!! Grand opening on Dec 20, 2013 but it is closed when ever visit. They didn't care to put note on door that they are close today. :( spending on gas and wasting time in driving ..:("}
{"text":"Great Indian restaurant! We tried their unlimited dosa offer and it was real! Andhra Kara  dosa was great! Mondays unlimited dosa's...."}
{"text":"Had a very disappointing experience here. The service was very poor. I was with my date and we left pretty dissatisfied . The food seemed reheated, our server was very rude and did not want to answer questions, and they made a mistake on my bill. I went out for a fine Indian dining experience but I will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I consider myself a connoisseur of Indian food coming from two of the best places India for incredible cuisine (Goa and Kerala) this place does indeed rise to the occasion. The lounge can prove to be a visual great and may be awkwardly uncomfortable in the beginning. Take off your shoes and relax a bit and this place turns into quite the exotic resto!"}
{"text":"My family and I just had the best dinner tonight at Nasha. The flavor was amazing and made at desired level of spicy. My two young girls did not have much experience with Indian cuisine and they loved it!  The tomato soup was amazing, as well as all the chicken dishes and lamb.  I really liked the curry chicken and chai tea to top it off. The staff was what made us want to return again very soon.  Maria was so welcoming and on top of our very large order. She did not forget one thing and made sure we had our food right away. She made appropriate suggestions when we asked for it. Then, the Chef came out to greet us and offered desert. A wonderful family experience and I look forward to lunch buffet there soon."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner on a Tuesday night. They were running specials - unlimited Chaat + Biryani + 1 Dosa for like $9. The food was pretty good.  We tried all the four Chaat they had and the chicken biryani. Chicken tikka dosa was really good too. The server Aayesha was friendly and prompt with the service. The owner seemed like a nice guy and chatted with us for a few minutes.   Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"New management. Went there this week. Food is much better. Staff is friendly..We tried a kabab and chicken curries.. Very nice.. Naan could be better but tasted very fresh.. they were becoming hard quicker.. may be becoz winter?? Curries tasted very nice. I hope this one stays.. Last few ownerships have changed some werent so good.."}
{"text":"Butter chicken and samosas were fantastic. We also tried a lamb dish the owner recommended. I was impressed with the flavor and price. This is a good place to try new styles of food and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I just noticed that another Indian restaurant was open at the same location as 2 previous failed attempts.  Apparently the 3rd time is the charm because this is a winner.  We did take out so can't speak to the buffet but the food was fantastic.  We way over-ordered but wanted to try a lot of things and they were all great.  The Samosa's were smaller than usual but there were 4 instead of 2 so they were fun to eat and tasted great.  Next we had their signature Goat dish, Laal Maas.  Goat by nature is a bony dish but this was much leaner than usual and the sauce was complex and perfectly spiced.  We also had the Rogan Josh.  Again, the meat was lean, tender and tasty with a perfect sauce.  Not seeing our favorite, Channa Masala, we tried the Delhi Matka Chole which was delicious.  The chickpeas were cooked just enough and spiced well.  The Konan Gobi (Cauliflower) was also very tasty.  We also had a side of Raita and a bread basket which is a mixture of 3 breads that were moist yet not greasy.  Finally, the rice was also flavorful and a great accompaniment to the sauces.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Went last week for unlimited biriyani and chat. I liked the samosa chat which had the right spice. Even liked the chicken biriyani.The chicken was tender and well cooked.Icing on the cake is you get everything unlimited incuding one dosa for $9. Would defnetly recommended this restaurant.   Also the manager was very cordial and would defnetly visit the restaurant again."}
{"text":"Their buffet will be A la carte started on Jan 2014"}
{"text":"Great Indian food! Ive eaten here for dosa Mondays and for the buffet on the weekend. The food is flavorful and spicy. The decor is nice and talking to the owner was a pleasant experience. I highly recommend this place if you like good Indian food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went and tried this today after being told it was a new restaurant. The last time we were in here we had the pleasure of watching the owner scream at a customer and follow him to his car yelling. We never went back.  We were happy to hear that it was new owners, new name but still Indian food.  We were really happy with the food and the service and the best part was the chicken tikka was made with white meat.  The naan was not the best I've had but it was good enough and the only disappointment was there was no rice pudding on the buffet. Loved the masala tea! :-))"}
{"text":"This place is closed, hopefully forever. If it reopens as another indian restaurant, RUN!"}
