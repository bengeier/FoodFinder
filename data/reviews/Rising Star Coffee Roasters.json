{"text":"Americano, Mocha, Matcha latte are awesome. I don't like the ice coffee here, it's a too sour to me.  The muffins are always good, especially the coffeecake muffin."}
{"text":"Totally first-rate.  The espresso is flavorful and prepared perfectly.  Highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Rising Star is quickly becoming my favorite Sunday morning spot.  The customer service is exceptional.  I've yet to encounter anyone who isn't just extremely pleasant and helpful.  I usually enjoy an Americano or a cup of tea. All of which have been great.  The decor and set up lends itself to a hip and relaxed environment.  There's a lot of thought put into everything here, how your coffee is made, served and enjoyed. And bonus, on Sundays you can enjoy a delicious waffle from the Euro Wafel Bar pop up.  I would definitely recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"really wonderful coffee shop!  everything is handmade with the cute designs on top. great espresso and coffee selection. staff is EXTREMELY wonderful, friendly, and helpful! my partner and i came in for a concert and they were so nice and even gave us an extra coffee to try since we mentioned it was our first time. would highly recommend if you're looking for a local coffee spot.  ps. get the cardamom bomb. c:"}
{"text":"Best coffee shop in Cleveland and truly captures the right vibe and ambiance in this space. Super friendly staff who all seem passionate about their craft. A great place to relax, enjoy a fabulous coffee drink, and a delicious bagel from Cleveland Bagel Co."}
{"text":"A top of the line independent coffee roaster is a requisite part of being a city enjoying a revival through arts and good dining, and Rising Star is without a doubt exactly that establishment. The baristas double as educators in a constant process of educating consumers in the world of coffee.   With that in mind, it is definitely worth mentioning that this place is best enjoyed by people who are SERIOUS about coffee. Everyone employee is knowledge and passionate about their products, all of which shows that they are serious about coffee. The fruits of their labor are unique coffees, carefully crafted drinks, and for me, a newfound appreciation of a drink that I depend on to function in the morning.   A coffee or espresso drink from Rising Star has flavors I had never conceived possible in a coffee drink. There is a reason why coffee tasting is emerging as a practice similar to wine tasting.   They are showing a documentary called Coffee Man, can't wait to go see, and it will also probably another deep dive into the world of serious coffee drinkers. At Rising Star, you can do all that in a relaxing environment."}
{"text":"I'm in a committed relationship with the Promised Land Latte. I really want to try something new, but it's a struggle when the Promised Land is the actual nectar of the gods. I think about it all day, and dream about it all night."}
{"text":"I ordered a latte and the staff completely forgot about it. I had to remind them twice before they made my coffee after 15 minutes of waiting. People who arrived later got their drinks while I waited and waited.  The male staff member with a dark blue shirt was not even polite when I reminded him that I don't think he was making my coffee. Female staff member was apologetic though."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a trip to the botanical gardens on a snowy day. I tried affogato, which is a scoop of ice cream with espresso poured over it. It was amazing. My boyfriend had the mocha which is made with locally sourced chocolate milk. We asked about the proper way to make pour over coffee and one of the employees took the time to make a cup. She walked us through step by step and the reasoning behind it. This was unexpected and awesome. What great customer service! Definitely stopping back the next time I'm in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to grab Coffee! It's soo good! Everything is pretty good- lattes, cappuccinos, and mochas(for those who want something sweeter)    I actually hated coffee before I came here but Rising Star made me a coffee lover!!!"}
{"text":"Very first visit to Rising Star even though I've lived in this neighborhood for over a year.  Got the Cardamom Bomb and it is AMAZING. I literally finished it on my way driving home !"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great coffee, world-class staff, not a single thing could be improved!"}
{"text":"yes.  as good as it gets.  really cool ambiance.  the baristas took time to explain choices.  we were so impressed we bought some merch and took home some Rising Star ground beans.  after two weeks of that coffee (and being spoiled by the high quality) we went back to commercial grinds and now we REALLY know how good the coffee and service is here at Rising Star."}
{"text":"Very open, natural space that's great for studying. Brick walls give it a rustic feel and it fits the mood of the space nicely. Their espresso is pretty good and I appreciate the diversity in drink type. Their coffee is stellar, especially aeropress. Staff is friendly and attentive.  If you're looking for great coffee and a good atmosphere, this is perfect. Some underlying pretentiousness but it's really not the focus."}
{"text":"Great staff and delicious drinks! They have some unique flavor combinations like the strawberry milk coffee my husband got. I will definitely be checking it out again soon!"}
{"text":"I just stopped at Rising Star Coffee Roasters Little Italy on my way into work. I brought my refillable coffee mug in, and was somewhat proud of my inner hipster for \"shopping locally.\" The shop is beautiful, and the coffee smells good.  When the clerk filled my cup, he announced the total: $3.00. That's fucking steep for a cup of coffee. But, ok.   However, I noticed that he only filled it two thirds of the way. I asked him if he could fill it all the way up, and he said \"oooohhhh, is that more than 16 ounces?\" I'm like \"yeah, it's 20, and for three dollars, can you just fill it up?\"  \"We can't make a habit of it, because we won't make any money.\" \"Well, you won't make any money if I don't come back.\"  Honestly, dude, that's not how it works. Four ounces of coffee costs you NOTHING. As an independent coffee roaster, I understand that it's nearly impossible to stay in business. But you don't win that battle by charging enormous prices *FOR LESS COFFEE*. It's not liquid gold. It's caffeine, and it makes my morning go right.   This experience made my morning go wrong. I don't want to leave the coffee shop feeling both ripped off and pissed off.   *Update*  I just had my first sip of the coffee. I prefer Starbucks."}
{"text":"Their specialty coffee were great! We had Promised Land Latte almond milk mocha. Plus hot chocolate for the kids. Not too sweet, not too bitter. It was great."}
{"text":"Found this gem by mistake as I go to little Italy twice a week.. One word..WOW. The decor, coffee and staff is second to none. Forget Starbucks you must come here . You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Finally, I visit this location.  Roomy space and I love that you can sit diner - style around a bar as a seating option.  It is nice to see RS expand and do well.  Coffee is as delicious as ever and the baristas are nothing short of Java nerds which is totally cool.  I LOVE that they served a glass of sparkling water alongside my Daydreamer whole milk latte on a cute little bamboo-esque platter.  Talk about elevating the coffee experience."}
{"text":"Good for both quick coffee pick-up and work/chill. Nice atmosphere, I enjoy working there, except there aren't enough power outlets."}
{"text":"Authentic third-wave hipster coffee, up to my snotty San Francisco standards. No drip here, and the cortados are made perfectly. Nice selection of baked goods - the palmiers are top-notch. But guys, if you're going to serve local bagels and cream cheese (both high quality), get a damn toaster!"}
{"text":"Place was nice and the staff friendly but unfortunately the coffee was just ok. It has outdoor seating and is in a nice part of Ohio City."}
{"text":"Amazing intelligent coffee. Lots of variety in choices. Extremely friendly baristas who know their stuff. Definitely recommend visiting if you are in the area. And it's a great area to be in! So close to little Italy"}
{"text":"Made my first trip here today! It felt great to patronize a local establishment that serves great coffee! The gentlemen who assisted me was very kind and knowledgable. The coffee was terrific and had much more body than an unnamed chain. Stop in to support a growing Cleveland business!"}
{"text":"This is my third visit here. I've had The Promisedland latte twice and a pour over coffee once. The lattes and pour over were great. The baristas are all super nice. No hipster attitude (although they do have the look) great place to work. Even if you don't find a table and sit at the bar the short stools are comfortable to sit. Oh, yes, also had a bagel once, also very tasty. They give serve a shot glass of sparkle water with the latte. I normally don't like sparkle water, but even their sparkle water is tasty!"}
{"text":"Stopped here just visiting Cleveland for the weekend. A local recommended this coffee shop. He said, the coffee is really really good, its made by REAL HIPSTERS so you know its banging. He was right. We got there about 9 am on a Saturday and it was packed. The line was to the door but it moved quickly. They had a large selection of tea and coffee. The baristas truly had a talent for making coffee and drinks. It was legit. This place is super cute with good coffee and food, and I would definitely return."}
{"text":"So, I've heard of craft beers, craft wines, but never...craft coffee?  The guys at Rising Star don't treat coffee as a bulk thing, no huge urns or large-scale diluted stuff that's been sitting there awhile.  They treat coffee as ART.   My wife and I went in to try the place out and it's located just at corner of Murray Hill and Edgehill, and were treated to coffee made BY THE CUP. This stuff was so strong and flavorful it would have brought people out of a COMA!   The staff was very nice and the place feels very zen, like a spartan idea of coffee shop, where the main focus is not the distraction of the surroundings but the coffee itself. Very interesting. The spartan surroundings, however, did not speak to me as well as a more cozy location could. they do have a wrap-around bar surrounding the central coffee \"island\", but comfortable was not my first thought. Again, very zen.   I did think, however, that the place needs a larger selection of accompanying foods (there were few,) and, due to the area, it's more of a walk-up place then a place to go to and park. There is street parking, but that changes hour to hour.   All in all, I think that Rising Star is good, but needs to rise higher in the coffee sky if it's going to compete. Go and give it a try, and tell me what you think:)   (Oh, and kudoes to them for their \"gender identity\" concept for restrooms, very interesting:)"}
{"text":"Such great coffee, tea and bakery! Highly recommend a stop here if you're in the area! We walk down from the hospital on a weekly basis!"}
{"text":"Great local coffee shop in the Little Italy neighborhood! Nice people and great coffee with some unique flavors for seasonal drinks!"}
{"text":"A unique selection of coffee. I had both espresso flavors (one with chocolate flavor and the other with fruit flavor). This is a nice coffee shop if you want a quite atmosphere to work or study. The coffee is not out of this world, but not your bland corner store cup or starbucks either. They have some bold and interesting flavors."}
{"text":"Yes! First review. Which isn't too hard if today is opening day.  I'm not the biggest coffee snob, but I do enjoy lattes and iced coffee. On this occasion, I went with the latte. I was first in line (and immediately after, 3-4 people were behind me--yes!! I didn't have to wait). At 3.85+tax, it was a fair price, given the amount of skill it takes to make a proper latte. My only complaint is that they use Square (which I dislike), so I paid in cash and dropped change into the tip jar.  There are plenty of tables up by the storefront and in the back that each seat 2-4 people. There's also bar-style seating around the espresso machines so you can watch them make your drink. I didn't see any outlets, but I admit I wasn't actively looking for one anyway. Plenty of people were there on their laptops doing work (free wifi!). A few minutes later, the barista came by with my latte and a small glass of water on a tray. I immediately felt like a hipster coffee snob. It was smooth, delicious and well-made.   Having gone to some of the famous coffee roasters/shops (Stumptown in Portland, Philz in SF), I'd say Rising Star is as good as it gets in Cleveland."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite coffee shop in Cleveland! This place ticks all the boxes: amazing coffee, a bunch of options, yummy bakery treats and a cozy vibe for when you want to sit and stay awhile.   Today I grabbed the promise land latte and a chocolate chip cookie to go - It was the highlight of my day. Check this place out, It is the real deal."}
{"text":"Now have gluten-free goodies again! Plus I feel like maybe the coffee has grown on me? Or something about how they roast or brew it has actually changed in the past year; in any case, I like it better now. So that's cool."}
{"text":"I love this place. Best coffee in the University Circle/Coventry/Little Italy area. You pay for what you get, and the quality/service is top notch. Starbucks and the rest of the coffee shops within the vicinity are a cheap buzz/crash and waste of money (IMHO).  Minus one star for the hours of operation. I really really really really really really really really really really really really wish they were open late, when I have my most productive/creative moments."}
{"text":"Excellent service, personable barista, and made the aeropress exactly how I wanted it. Delicious!"}
{"text":"The new Little Italy Rising Star location is perfect! In contrast to the west side location (which is more about the beans and coffee to order, with limited seating), this place has plenty of space and seating. It's clean, modern, trendy. I came here with a friend to chat and catch up, and we definitely enjoyed the overall experience and our coffees (cortado - two thumbs up!!) Rising Star coffee never fails.   The baristas are also very friendly and helpful - keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee made by people who know their stuff. Lots of great options on the coffee menu. I also loved their vegan cookies. The space is roomy and has great bar-like seating. A very cool vibe all around."}
{"text":"I love me some Rising Star! I'm from Canada and every time I come to visit I always bring beans back with me to have my little piece of Cleveland when I'm at home. But I must say, I'm a little disappointed with the service and quality of this location. I use to frequent the Little Italy Rising Star when I lived in Cleveland Heights a couple years ago. It's a really cute shop, great location in a mesh-pot of locals, college students and professionals. My most frequent visits I've ordered cardamom bombs. First one I waited almost 10min for because there was a mix up in orders. To be fair, there was a surge of customers at the time but with only one barista on shift, she was rushed and as such, my order was lost and my drink looked rushed as well once it was prepared. Second visit, I thought I'd stay in to enjoy my drink. There were no clean cups so I was given a paper cup. But as I sat down there were a pile of used cups resting on the counter that remained there until I left. The foam in my drink was also incredible thick! Again, ordered a cardamom bomb, not a cappuccino. And to boot, the wifi wasn't working. Just not the experience I remembered just a few short years ago: friendly, helpful and thoughtful service and good coffee. Left a bad taste in my mouth. Maybe with increasing popularity, the place has just become busier, but the service shouldn't suffer as a result. Will still be a Rising Star faithful. Just a little disappointed is all."}
{"text":"Cool/relaxed ambiance. First time coming here, so I didn't know what to expect, but I've heard good things about the other two locations. Walked in and was greeted nicely. Told the lady working that I'd never been there before and she informed me of their popular drinks, recommended a few, and was descriptive. Very helpful. I got one of the ones she recommended and it was very good! Cool place to go if you're ever in Little Italy or just Cleveland in general."}
{"text":"I love this coffee place. It's a little off the beaten path off the main drag of Little Italy, but worth checking out (definitely has the best coffee in Little Italy!).  I usually order the Cardamom Bomb, but their other coffee drinks are good too. This is a place that really knows their coffee and they use all of the cool looking coffee paraphernalia when making your brew.  The decor is a little spartan (it's not the cosiest appearing place inside) and it is often difficult to find a seat because it can get busy, though it's fine if you are okay with sitting at the counter or getting coffee to go."}
{"text":"I love the hipster feel of this place! And of course, the coffee is delicious! I highly recommend the cardamom bomb with almond milk- the cardamom and the almond complement each other perfectly. Also, the seltzer water shot that comes with it is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Had a ball here today with my \"Honey-girl\". Got a couple cups of great small batch coffee, local bottle of pure natural honey, stocked up on issues of Edible Cleveland, but best of all was the million dollar service from Emma & Melissa! Except if they were actually paid the million dollars a hour they requested I wonder how much the coffee would cost?"}
{"text":"Coffees are a little sour for my taste but low acidity and smooth. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful  and knowledgeable about coffee. Pastries are great too. They have plenty of options for those that have gluten sensitivities or want to avoid animal products."}
{"text":"Man this is good coffee. You walk in and it's not a coffee house, it's a caffeine laboratory. And the coffee is just exquisite. When it was warmer I would ride my bike up there to hang out outside, enjoy my coffee and doodle. It's a great place to do just that, though I've never tried to sit inside during the colder months so I'm not sure how crowded it gets. They also accept credit cards with Square, which I'm happy to see is becoming more common for small businesses."}
{"text":"Had an incredibly delicious mocha here and staff was incredibly pleasant. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee, especially of the pour-over variety, which features well-sourced beans from around the globe. One sip of one of their pour-overs underscores the huge gap in difference - and refinement - over run-of-the-mill drip coffee of the Starbucks variety.  On this note, I call BS on one reviewer who says that a $4 pour-over coffee was \"definitely not worth quite that much money.\" Start with Starbucks prices and you're almost there at $4. And in big cities with world-class roasters, for example Blue Bottle and Ritual in the Bay Area, you're paying far more than $4 for exceptional pour-overs. It's like saying that a Five Guys or an In-and-Out burger is not worth it when you're used to getting a double cheeseburger off the value menu at McDonald's. Not even in the same league, whether you're talking about coffee, burgers, or what it takes to be an Elite in different cities.  As an added bonus, just about everything else about this place is solid, whether the baked goods, the friendly service, or the plentiful space that accommodates lots of students from the surrounding area. It's great to see quality local establishments like this here in Cleveland that can hold their own anywhere."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I love little Italy area in Cleveland and my wife and I always like trying local coffee shops when we are out and about. Our Batista here was super friendly, very knowledge about speciality coffees. I had the almond mocha it was literally one of the best coffees I have ever tasted in my life. If your in this are stop by you won't be disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular customer of the Ohio City Rising Star for over a year, so of course I was ecstatic to learn that a second location was opening within walking distance from my apartment. I've been quite a few times, and they've done a great job with the space.  The seating seems designed to be communal, and I enjoy the ambiance. There is actually ample seating at this location, with a wrap-around bar and a few tables for larger groups, so you can hang around here more easily than at the other one. They'll serve you if you sit at the bar, so that's nice. Rumor has it that they'll be expanding the seating in their Ohio City location before long as well, once they get a dedicated space for their roasting operation (which is currently two large drum roasters in the back of their Ohio City shop).  The coffee is the same fantastic coffee they serve at the other location. It's mostly fairly lightly-roasted single-origin coffee. You can have brewed coffee brewed in a Bee House pour-over or an Aeropress, Iced coffee (cold brew), or any number of espresso drinks with two options for espresso (either their current espresso blend, or a rotating single origin). They have seasonal drinks as well, both coffee-based and otherwise. Sadly, they don't have the siphon/vacuum pots in this location, but the other options are sufficient.  They use a Mahlkonig EK43 for a brew grinder and two Mahlkonig K30's for espresso. Their espresso machine is a Synesso.  They do have limited food and pastry offerings. Pastries are from Zoss Bakery on Cedar Rd and are very good. They have bagels from the Cleveland Bagel Company which are decent; nothing to write home about, but not bad (although I grew up in NYC so my standards for bagels are pretty high).   They do sell beans in this location as well. They're high quality beans, usually roasted well, and the ones on the shelves are usually fresh, within a week of their roast date (printed on the back). Pricing may seem steep to those not used to specialty coffee, but it's in line with other specialty shops at $14.50 for most 12 oz bags.  Rising Star is a welcome addition to the area, and certainly the best coffee in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place. The service is always friendly (as well as knowledgeable) and I always receive a great products. The atmosphere is quite calm and the space is large enough to feel like there are people around but personal space is never an issue."}
{"text":"Rising Star has risen in the east. Finally.  I walk in and automatically love the ambiance. Located in Little Italy, along a cobbled road, in a university neighborhood; the shop itself is a refurbished home that on the inside looks like a New York loft.  If Folger's coffee is first wave, and Starbucks is second wave, then Rising Star is among the third wave of coffee shops that offer sophistication and opulence at a step above. For lattes, they offered me two blends: a mellow blend and a lively blend. I took the mellow blend and hands down, it was among the best cups of Joe I've ever had in Cleveland; rich, creamy, nutty, complex and flavorful.  For many years, Europeans, Italians in particular, have made fun of the American taste for watered-down coffee. In fact, the name \"Cafe Americano\" came to be, because this is what they had to serve American GIs in WW2 to cater to that preference. With Cleveland gems like Rising Star, Pour and Phoenix; we have something that serious coffee lovers can savor, and that might rival the stuff they serve across the pond, and at way less than the overpriced 5 to 10 Euros. It is rather fitting that this shop finally took root in Little Italy.  Parking is a challenge. But in the morning or off-lunch and off-dinner hours, the parking lot at Michelangelo's restaurant across the street is empty. But no, that's their parking lot and I would never recommend parking there. I did not do it, no sir, that would have been frowned upon."}
{"text":"I was reluctant to try the coffee at Rising Star. Who wouldn't be with those communist overtones? But alas, it was 8:00 am and I needed coffee and a bagel to fuel my morning, so I took the plunge. Already I noticed a troubling omen: there were no sizes. $3 for a nondescript amount of coffee? This could not be good. I ordered my mystery cup of coffee with an everything bagel and cream cheese. Sure it was more expensive than Einsteins's, but that indie charm has to be worth the extra few bucks, right? What happened next blew my mind. The cashier took an everything bagel out of the display case and just threw it in a paper bag. WITHOUT CUTTING OR TOASTING IT. She then throws in a plastic knife and a small cup of cream cheese. You expect me to cut an untoasted bagel on the counter with a plastic knife and get crumbs and poppy seeds everywhere like an idiot? This place is obviously run by sadists because that is cruel. The coffee was also presented in a disappointing manner. When you get a paper cup of scalding hot coffee, you expect a paper cozy around the cup so you don't burn your hand off. Rising Star must want to burn my hand off because there was no cozy in sight. I usually like to put milk in my coffee, but Rising Star insisted that that cream was the only choice I should have available. I haven't even gotten around to how the coffee and bagel tasted. In short, not good. The coffee was somehow sour, lacking that warm satisfying taste that you would find literally anywhere else. The bagel was at least a day old based off of the difficulty to chew it. In short, the star in the coffee shop's title is the only star this review will include. Unless you're out to prove your indie cred, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The perfect latte and perfect atmosphere. I'm so glad to see a coffee shop of this caliber in Cleveland.   Rising Star really elevates the coffee drinking experience. I'm not a daily coffee drinker, but after 1 sip of their latte, I was hooked and had to stop by the next day.  It's just a 5 minute walk down Cornell from Case and UH, so it's super convenient!  And the wrap around coffee bar ensures plenty of room to sit down and have a conversation with a friend."}
{"text":"Place is a decent place to get your other than basic coffee. The coffee is good, the service could use some work.  I totally understand you have a set menu but you still need to flex with your customer a little without making them feel stupid. Yes I am far from a coffee connoisseur but I know what I personally like. So when I ask for something a little different or not recommended please politely give me your advice and then stop hassling me when I insist on what I want.  Other than that the seating is not real great. Could use some booths to relax a little more.  Overall though the coffee is worth it."}
{"text":"Full disclaimer: I don't drink coffee. But I bring all my coffee-drinking friends here when they are visiting. They have all been very impressed with their beverages.   My other reason for posting this review is because of the waffle guy that comes on Sundays (Euro-waffle bar). For $8-10 I can get the most delicious waffle I've ever had in the US. It's dense and rich and filling. There is always an assortment of fruits, sauces, and toppings to choose from. Some perfect examples (not all together, people, get a hold of yourselves!): bacon, raspberries, bananas, strawberries, nutella, carmel, whipped cream, ferrero rocher, cookie butter, fudge, and I am sure others that I just haven't gotten to yet! I am so glad this is right down the street."}
{"text":"Great, unique coffee house. This location is a lot bigger than their other location in Ohio City. Ordered their iced coffee (only 1 size available) and it tasted great! I don't remember the name of the beans that were used in my coffee, but it tasted a little bit sweet without adding any sugar which I loved. Also love that coffees come with a cup of sparkling or flat water. Prices are definitely steeper than a corner deli and probably even more expensive than Starbucks if you compare regular coffees. I would still come back to Rising Star for their great service, store ambiance and unique tasting coffees!"}
{"text":"Top rate coffee place.  Synesso espresso machine.  Their small batch roasted coffee is clean, delicate, tasteful, and complex.  Trendy setting and presentation.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"Exceptional coffee. Best in Cleveland. Setting is a clean, friendly and relaxed atmosphere.  Staff are true batista's. Great experience every time I've been. It is worth a detour from the usual grind!"}
{"text":"Most delish espresso!  Creamy perfect and strong not bitter Viva la ohio Ps Fabulous relaxing atmosphere"}
{"text":"My all time favorite coffee shop in Cleveland. Such an incredible vibe the minute you walk through the door. The employees are extremely friendly, and they make a MEAN cappuccino. I would recommend to everyone if I could."}
{"text":"I've found my new favorite study spot!   The ambiance is great. Compared to some other great coffee places, Stumptown in Portland for example, Rising Star is pretty solid for Cleveland. The space is open but still warm and inviting. Love the exposed brick! There's several individual tables or you can sit at the large bar. Either way you can watch the baristas at work, which is cool. You can order at the front or be seated and a barista will come to you, which is convenient. I ended up picking one of their pour overs and it was really good quality coffee, probably the best I've had in Cleveland. I like the care they take to grind the coffee individually. Plus the mug was warm! The lattes look great too. Wifi is free and fast. They play a variety of music (like old Bollywood - shut up!) but it's a tad too loud for me. Regardless, I'll be back."}
{"text":"In places like New York and Los Angeles there are infamous $15 lattes. Here in Cleveland you can experience a 15 minute latte for yourself...or more like 20 minutes. When traveling I always make an effort to support local coffee roasters and avoid big name coffee spots and I totally understand that not all places move at the same pace as the bigger cities I've always called home. However, walking into a coffee roaster that has no line, ordering right away and waiting 20 minutes for an iced latte to go is totally not cool. The coffee was very good but I thought I was being punked as I watched the only barista meticulously craft drinks in slow motion and carry them out to guests one by one as other employees hung out behind the counter. Help your barista out guys! Definitely check out Rising Star Coffee Roasters if you want some delicious coffee, but make sure you have the morning free to sit back and relax."}
{"text":"I love rising star. There really aren't many(any) third wave coffee shops in Cleveland, where rising star is one of the better third wave shops I've been to anywhere."}
{"text":"So this coffee is a little on the pricey side. But if you're a huge coffee snob - as my sidekick is - you will love the taste. Delicious every time. :)"}
{"text":"Excellent, flavorful, strong and aromatic coffees. Lots of variety. Good snacks. What more could you possibly want?"}
{"text":"You guys do make good coffee. However, the wait is always ridiculous and the prices are a bit too high. We used to love coming in there, now it's just a nightmare. Between the heat, the wait and the cost. It isn't quite worth it anymore. We did visit the rising star over in little Italy because our friends were having a brunch there. That one was MUCH better ran than the one in Ohio city. Our drinks were ready very very quickly, still priced very high but, for some reason, better tasting. I'm unsure if it was the barista or a different type of bean. I think we will be heading back to the one in little Italy. Bigger, cooler and 100% better than the one on the west side. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Based upon my recent visit to Rising Star, I would have to say that is just OK. I love pour over coffee because I believe that you can taste the specialty flavors very well in this style. The pour over coffee I ordered recently was great! I believe it was from Ethiopia. However, it was not worth the $4 I paid for it! Definitely not worth quite that much money.   Now, I feel I must discuss my recent (4/6/17) service I experienced. The waiter was very standoffish and was rude when I accidentally thought a batch coffee option was available as a pour over option. I also ordered a bagel as well, and he did not even ask me if I wanted it toasted! I also asked him which spread would go best with the bagel and while he helped me decide, he seemed like he did not care enjoyed if I enjoyed the food or not.   The price I paid for the bagel and the coffee was not worth it based upon the service I received. If an establishment claims to serve upscale artisan coffee, the staff should know how to educate their customers on how to choose the right coffee and food to go with."}
{"text":"My family was visiting Little Italy for the afternoon and we wanted to get a cup of coffee. Luckily a friend told me about Rising Star aka the perfect place to take my Seattle turned Chicago coffee snob sister and brother in law. I am also not a novice when it comes to coffee.   We ordered three Americanos with the Guatemala espresso as directed by the woman at the counter. That coffee is a true work of art. Not only does the coffee look and smell beautiful the process of pouring the shots of espresso is also a work of art!    The Americano or USA as written on our to go cups was dark and robust. It is one of the best cups of coffee I have had in a while! My sister and brother in law also love Rising Star! Bravo for a fantastic cup of coffee!!   My only request is that you add another location in Kamm's Corner on the westside!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of coffee and the whole experience so when it came time to explore Little Italy, my friend took me to this place. I'm not from the area, but I definitely fell in love with it along with Rising Star from my first visit. My first view was the color of the their walls with bright red doors. There is some retail space for coffee, tea, shirt, honey, and EPIC (yay) bars. I actually bought a turkey EPIC bar along with iced coffee. There was photography on the brick wall, seating up front, and a cool wrap around coffee bar with additional seating towards the rear. I just love, love, love the bar area. The bar stools are lower and I thought that would be uncomfortable, but surprisingly I really enjoyed the seating. The people were friendly and I loved their iced coffee. The neighborhood, vibe, people, coffee, and the whole space really got me. It's simple, efficient, has it's own personality, and leaves an imprint on my mind. Love!"}
{"text":"Basically I think of this place as a Rubik's cube. But sadly not the original Rubik's cube. Confused yet? Yeah me too. What am I even talking about? Maybe I'm drunk. Maybe I'm delirious. Maybe I'm hallucinating vile images of robot coffee snobs toying with electronic Rubik's cubes. Who knows? Back to the story line... Basically I think of this place as a Rubik's cube. The Rubik's cube was heroic. It was simple but educational; it was fun; it was genius and it can not be replaced. No matter how hard anyone may try. The original is where it's at. The original Rising Star; I like it the best. I did like the new Rising Star, (I had been anticipating it for quite some short while) but I feel like they did such a wonderful job in the first place that the second one must bow before the original's genius.   So about the actual place and its coffee. It is a charming cafe nestled on a quaint little street in Little Italy. Inside it is aglow with warm colors and a warm atmosphere. I can appreciate the way the large bar/work area is right in the middle of everything with seating all around. It is nice. Not gonna disagree with that.   And I would have appreciated it so much more if my macchiato had been better. It looked a bit sad (which I realize is a hard thing not to do) and it tasted a bit bad. Just a bit; it was alright, and the glass of sparkling water fixed my palates.   It is nice. I do like the place and usually the coffee, but apparently they can't improve on perfect. Which is what the original is.   Update: 12/26/15 My next visit, and I realize that I actually like this place quite well; like it thought I was going to in the first place. Hence the upgrade to five stars. (Although I still like the original Rising Star better.)"}
{"text":"Rising Star is the best coffee shop I've been to in Cleveland, and does more than hold it's own against the coffee shops I've been to in Seattle. The drinks are prepared true to tradition (a latte is 12oz, a cappuccino is 8oz, etc. and each beverage is served with a small glass of sparkling water.   Occasionally R* will bring in chefs from local eateries for pop-up brunch. These are usually delicious but come early- it is still a coffee shop, not a restaurant.   The music is tasteful- R* is probably the only place in public where I've heard albums played though from start to finish.  My only complaints are minor- there aren't enough power outlets, and I prefer chairs to stools. Otherwise, there is no better place to spend an early morning work session."}
{"text":"Pricey, expensive, plays discordant music sometimes. 4 stars.  Best place to study outside of the medical school, hands down. The vibe is nice, easy, and slow; the cardamom bombs are figuratively the best. The baristas are good looking and cute. Background music is soft, other than the occasional what-I-mentioned-above.  This place is more about the study atmosphere than it is about the coffee (which is decent, but perhaps overpriced)."}
{"text":"SUMMARY:  OK coffee, less-than-pleasant service.   FULL STORY:  Went here on a Saturday - late afternoon.  There were 2-3 other people in the shop.  My friend and I had very simple drink orders...  the coffee was fine, the place was ok, the biscotti was fine.  But despite a low volume of customers and over an hour until close... the woman behind the counter seemed annoyed and put-upon to have to pour any coffee....    Two professional people coming in during business hours to order coffee at a coffee place...  should generally not be met with loud sighs and impatience.  There are a bunch of other great coffee places nearby -- wouldn't try this one again unless I was REALLY in the mood for their specialty:  a hipster eye-roll.    Literally 2 minutes before closing time, someone came by to bark \"We're closed now.\"  Came across as brash.   Note: (Limited) street parking.  Just go to Luna or somewhere instead... they even have a parking lot!"}
{"text":"I've been in Cleveland for less than 3 months and according to Yelp have checked in here 9 times haha. I think it's about time a review is due :)  My go-to drinks here are the matcha latte and the promised land latte - both of which I like to get iced. I have also tried their affogato and caramel date sticky cake, both of which are a bit more of indulgences but super yummy nonetheless. The employees here I've encountered have also been accommodating. At my last visit, I ordered a promised land latte but realized as I was sitting down with my stuff that I forgot to ask for it iced. I rushed over to the counter to ask if it was still possible to get the drink iced and even though the barista had just steamed the milk for the hot latte, he kindly made the drink iced for me.  Overall, Rising Star is a nice study spot that is both close to campus and close to where I live. I imagine I will be here many more times in the future just because of how convenient of a place it is haha. My friend also told me the cardamom bomb drink here is really good, but I have yet to try that (I've been waiting for the weather to cool down for a bit since I usually like cold drinks). I definitely recommend Rising Star for their coffee, great customer service, and nice environment!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Quaint little shop in little Italy area. I got the cardamom bomb and almond milk. Their Rugelach is to die for!! Definitely visiting again :)"}
{"text":"Best coffee house on the east side of CLE.  Great location too on a small side street in Little Italy.  Cafe Latte every time with carrot cake.  They also give you a separate sparking soda water which cleanses the palate between coffee sips. I am going there this morning now that I think about how good it is :)"}
{"text":"I was visiting Cleveland and saw great reviews for this cafe, so I thought I'd check it out. We were getting drinks to go, but we loved the vibe inside and seemed like the kind of place we'd enjoy sitting and reading in. I tried ordering a hot chocolate with almond milk, but their hot chocolate is pre-made with whole milk, so they were unable to substitute the milk. I ended up not ordering anything but tried a bit of my boyfriend's Americano. We were both super impressed! It had a rich flavor, nice viscosity, and pleasant aftertaste. I will definitely come back the next time I'm in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I go to this coffee shop at least once/week. I'd probably go more if it were closer to my house. I always get great service and perfectly silky almond spiced mochas. The prices are comparable to Starbucks with far superior quality. I love that they use local farms for the milk and honey for the Promised Land Lattes! If I had only one (minor) complaint it would be lack of street parking. I wish they had a cooperative with Michaelangelo's restaurant to allow parking in their lot if you're just running in for a quick drink. Clearly the parking issue hasn't deterred me at all. I love this place! Go...now!"}
{"text":"I really do like this place! The coffee is excellent and the staff is friendly. The ambiance is nice and it's a good study spot. The reason for the three stars is unfortunately because of the service. They have a note on their posted menu that if you're going to have your coffee in house, you can sit at the bar and they'll come take your order. I sat and someone noticed me pretty quickly and gave me a menu, but then I waited 20 minutes for someone to ask what I wanted. The original server never came back over to check on me, and I made an attempt to catch her eye several times. I wound up just going to the front counter to order.  It's totally fine if you have to order at the front, but I wish they would either not tell people to wait at the bar, or pay attention to them when they do. That said, I'll still be back!"}
{"text":"If you you have a passion for coffee and live in the Cleveland area this my be the Mecca of third wave coffee in Cleveland. Great in house roasted coffee many single origins choices and some blends. Great atmosphere and friendly service"}
{"text":"Bougie coffee without a bougie feel.  The coffee is delicious and fresh with pour overs as their brewed coffee. The customer service is great  and they do great job of explaining their different drinks. Much better than your average barista.  The atmosphere inside is also great - either just to chat or to study.  Cost isn't cheap but is appropriate for the quality!"}
{"text":"Really good coffee.  Restaurant is clean and nice place to bring a date or pop open the laptop for some work.   Very spacious seating.  They have a cool Aeropress system.   Staff was very knowledgable on he coffee selections.  I was in the area killing time and glad this popped up on my search for coffee.  Will make a special trip next time I am in the area!"}
{"text":"Out of all of the coffee I've sipped since stepping foot in cleveland this is surely the most enjoyable. I had the house blend latte which was served italian style alongside a glass of seltzer. Perfection.  I also noshed on a peppered parmesan scone; a delicate balance of sweet and savory. Everything I wanted to round out my morning.  The staff was welcoming,  the mood relaxed, and I will be returning, hungry for more :)"}
{"text":"Simply put: awesome lattes--the perfect balance of bitter and sweet that coffee lovers around the world have been chasing."}
{"text":"Tried this place this past weekend, was excited there was somewhere aside from a restaurant right in little Italy to get coffee. I am a coffee fanatic, I've been to coffee tastings, coffee classes, I've ordered prime beans from around the world, and even paid several times to have coffee roasted to my personal taste... Needless to say, I LOVE coffee. The atmosphere isn't too bad, the staff was extremely friendly and the place was spotless (expectedly so since its brand new). The coffee... Was OK. I got their house blend in the form of a light water hot Americano.  I really didn't find the taste all that impressive nor was there much depth in the flavor. I sort of had an indifferent, great place to grab coffee for grandma and grandpa feeling. As this was only one blend and my first time there I do plan to go back and hopefully have a better experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely great iced coffee. Actually better than Starbucks. The cinnamon was great too. The downsides were no discounted or free refills and no cocoa powder."}
{"text":"I've been able to experience most coffee shops in the Cleveland area and I think Rising Star does it best.  They serve their own roasts and always have a variety, the espressos they pull are typically interesting and something new.  The people behind the counter always greet you or offer to help when you walk in the door, always very friendly.  I also love that they open at 6am, none of this 8ish start times when a lot of people are already at work.  My only wish is that they could keep more Ethiopian beans in stock, but that's a personal preference I suppose.  I'm giving it $$$ because as far as coffee shops go it's on the pricey side, but I'm a firm believer in you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This was the WORST coffee bar I have ever frequented.  There were 4 of us and we each tried different types of coffee from espressos to aero press to regular with extra espresso shots.  We ALL threw our coffees away before we even left the store.  If you like a good cup of coffee go to Starbucks.  I'd give this minus 5 stars."}
{"text":"A bit on the pricy side, but definitely the best place in uptown/little Italy to get espresso. Also a great place to get work done, meet someone etc. Pretty solid 3rd wave shop."}
{"text":"Super friendly and fun Staff! They give great advice! Different coffees from around the world! Good place to study, work, or just relax!! Free wifi! I tried an expresso and a sweet latte! Both really different so make sure you let them know what u like! It was packed when I got here but the service was fast!"}
{"text":"Matcha latte is ok, but service is so so. People who make the latte could do a better job if paying more attention."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about Cleveland's coffee scene is that it's unpretentious. Rising star is consistently good and always perfecting their craft. I respect them for that. I'm a traditionalist when it comes to coffee, I like short espressos and clean pour overs, by their cardamom bomb is, as the name alludes, bomb!"}
