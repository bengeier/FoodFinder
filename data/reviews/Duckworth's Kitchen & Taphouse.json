{"text":"As other reviewers have mentioned, the beer selection is great, but.... no Guinness on tap!?!  Isn't there a rule about this, somewhere?  That to be considered a bar with a good beer selection you have to have the real King-of-Beers on tap?  Out of a bottle does not do my Guinny any justice.  

The food is bar food but for a vegetarian, it is a terrible selection.  The salads are not good.  HUGE but not tasty.  My husband liked the wings just fine.  

Too many other places with beer selection and good food for this to my go-to bar.  Or to be a go-again bar."}
{"text":"Awesome place to watch sports - they've got a ton of flat screens with multiple sports channels going - and one of the best beer selections around. I'm a huge craft beer fan and this place definitely hits the spot. Pub style food is done well, too ;)"}
{"text":"Duckworth's is the best place in Charlotte for craft beer.  Hands Down.

This is a place I go anytime I am in the area to try some new beers or enjoy one of my favorites.  The taps constantly rotate and they always have a good selection of seasonals/rarities (Think Stone Enjoy By)

Beer flights are relatively inexpensive and give you a chance to try a bit of everything on the 60+ tap menu.

There is something for everyone, from your most basic of beers to some of the rarest beers in the country.  They have a number of local brews as well as beers from around the world.  The bartenders are well versed in the craft beer scene and will answer any question you throw at them or give you a suggestion on what to try

The beer by itself can be a bit on the expensive side but remember you are paying for quality, not quantity.

The food Menu consists of awesome bar fare and snacks.  I can't get over how good their Philly Cheesesteaks are.  The Smokehouse Philly was one of the better sandwiches I've had at a \"chain\" restaurant.  The Buffalo Chicken Nachos are also very unique and delicious. I was somewhat surprised by the high price of the food bill (Nachos were 14.99, sandwich 13.99).

For Sports, Duckworth's has all the Major sports packages, which is a plus for an out of towner like myself.

If I had 1 complaint it's that the servers aren't too attentive to your needs.  I've asked to have a game put on only to have to ask multiple times before it was changed.  Same for refills, napkins, ect.  Also parking is a bit scarce in the area but not too bad with a strip mall next to it.

Overall this is a great place to enjoy a beer and snack.  I look forward to coming back every time."}
{"text":"Fantastic Service. Have to be careful what you order. I ordered the famous supreme steak Philly and it was excellent. My wife ordered their chicken breast dinner and said it was not that great. Said the chicken tasted like it was frozen and just warmed up. Although she didn't complain. Just be careful what you order. Otherwise service is always good and prompt. I would recommend it and especially the steak hoogies and supreme is the best thing on menu."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, awesome beer selection draft and bottle, and great staff. Family friendly with a good tv selection.  Lesley was a great waitress."}
{"text":"Very wide selection of beer. Don't get too comfortable with a beer, one month it's there and the next month it may be gone. Food is pretty good too. A little loud and somewhat crowded at night but lunch time is usually not as busy."}
{"text":"The wings and sweet potato fries were delicious! Each of us had different style wings and they were all unique and wonderful! The regular fries and tater tots were much better than expected. It was loud because of several football games happening on a Saturday night but that's what you get at a place like this. 

The service was just okay, our appetizer came out with our food and our waitress mixed up our beer order but she was very nice. Again if you're going for good wings or what I deem as \"sports\" food my guess is it would be hard to beat!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Many choices of beer. Quick service. Will be back . Plenty tv's to watch games . Overall all experience was good. Glad I stopped ."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place. It seems Every time i come my food is different.  Cooks are not on the same page. I always sit near the kitchen hoping my homestyle fries are hot but they never are..i usually come about 2xa week but I have writte. So many comments and nothing change. I'm going to try another one. I live in Ballantyne but I will drive anywhere for good food."}
{"text":"Just paid almost 9.00 for a really bad cheesesteak.  Meat is not good quality and the bread was not even close to the kind used for Philly's.  Save your money and go to Jersey Mike's.  They at least have decent Philly's."}
{"text":"Never had anything we didn't love. Don't leave without trying the sweet potato fries. Service is great!"}
{"text":"This place is great, very nice and relaxing atmosphere and both the food and service was excellent!!!!"}
{"text":"Avg food, mediocre service. Does have good beers.  For all the beers they have staff should be more knowledgeable."}
{"text":"I'm conflicted about this place. Lots of great beer on offer, but very little in the lager range. Food is okay, but not reliable in quality. Service is sort of hit and miss, can be good, can be indifferent. Take your chance, maybe you'll catch them on a good night."}

{"text":"I'm here based on Yelp. Great tap bar. Had a Terra give me her favorite 4 pale
Ales in the sampler. The Bells Oberon was best. Had the moomamoo wings and bold and spicy wings in a 10 wing special. Bothe were great! Wings were average size:( A serving of 10 met my needs.

Besides the beer sampler, I had a \"Strawberry Wit\" beer blend. It was fabulous.

Dessert was fair. I had pumpkin praline pie. Asked for alamode and Terra said the don't have ice cream:(. She got me some whipping cream. The pie was terrific, like a cheese cake. Did not need alamode. Glad I didn't order the choc cake. 

Terra served bar. She was terrific!"}
{"text":"We checked out the new location last week.  The bar and tap line-up are unprecedented for anywhere in the Southend or Montford area.  And since it was the opening weekend, and very busy, I'll overlook the luke-warm temperature of the several different beers that I tried.

The cheesesteak sandwich I had was very good, but the lack of any type of side was disappointing for the price.  

There was also a band that night, but the set-up of the new location is not very conducive.  We could hardly even hear the band from where we were seated even though we were not that far away. We had a much nicer time when the bands played in the courtyard. 

Unfortunately in life, there are constant trade offs. I just need to find a way to combine the outdoor patio of Macs, the ice-cold draft pours at Icehouse, and the 60 tap draft selection of Duckworths. Oh, and lets add a Macs pulled-pork Philly sandwich to that list."}
{"text":"Stopped at Duckworth's recently to celebrate our anniversary by chance; our first choice has a long wait and I'd been wanting to try Duckworth's for some time.  I'd heard that the beer selection was quite good and was not disappointed in that regard.  They featured a nice sampling of local, regional and national craft beers both on draft and in bottle.  And best of all it was $3 dollar Tuesday.  The menu is extensive and the four of us ordered different items, ranging from a sandwich to a salad to an entree.  The portion sizes were large and represented a good value for the money.  Good was tasty and nicely prepared and all at the table enjoyed the meal.  I'll return again, although it is a bit of a drive for us so it won't be on a regular basis.  It would make for a great neighborhood hangout."}
{"text":"Came for drinks and a bite to catch up with a friend. Great beer selection. Very pleasant wait staff with good knowledge of beer list. Reminds me somewhat of Capital Ale House in Richmond, VA. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great Place to Grab a Beer and Eat Incredible Food 

I'm becoming a regular at Duckworths because every time I go, I receive excellent service, an almost unrivalled beer selection, and astounding food at a very fair price. 

Ambiance is low key, lots of TV to catch the game and very friendly staff. Never had to wait more than 15 minutes for food, and if it does take too long, managers are quick to make it right. 

In my opinion, one of the best places to eat in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, and great atmosphere.  Wide variety so everyone should find something they like here.  Also has a nice patio if you want to enjoy the outside."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere-nice staff-great food! 
Love the steak and cheese w tator tots or flatbread so yummy :)"}
{"text":"A friend became ill at Duckworth's and passed out. I paid the bill and went to go sit with a friend, and wait to go to the hospital. While... the EMT's were still working on her, the manager felt it was more important to accuse us of not paying twenty dollar bar tab (that had already been paid) than to ask if she was ok. He then accused her of going to the bathroom and doing illegal drugs, and wanted to know what drugs she was on.

He later banned her from the restaurant  because, and I quote: \"I don't want anyone in here that may be on medication.\" Apparently he thinks he has the right to demand to know what medication you may be taking in order to overpay for food in his restaurant. 

Even after it was explained that she most likely had a reaction to a new medication that she was prescribed he continued to state that he didn't want anyone on medication in his restaurant and that he had the right to know what medications anyone eating there was taking. 

I have never witnessed a manager in a restaurant act the way he did, and will never give this place a dime of my money again.  If you believe in privacy and being treated with respect you won't either."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, great beer,fantastic meal, great price.  Well worth the trip and will be back MANY more Times....!!

I got the pizza,ribs, wings...all great...some of the best in the Queen City"}
{"text":"Horrible service by a server who I can see talking on his cell phone in the kitchen.  After waiting 15 minutes for a beer, I went up to the bar to get one.  Bartenders walked past number of times and just continued to clean behind the bar.  You can tell when someone has taken notice of you, but for some reason they were more set on cleaning.  After about 25 minutes asked the server for the beer again and finally received it.  

Saw the manager take notice of all the finished dishes on our table and never did anything about it.  After a half hour, decided to clear the dishes myself and place on table next to us.  

Total fail on part of the owners and management.  Sorry you had to work on the Super Bowl, but it's the business you choose to work in.  Only plus side was when Kendra took over as our server and was attentive to us for the rest of the evening."}
{"text":"I had the Chicken Quesadillas here last week and they were awesome!  Chris was our waiter and he did a great job.  

Five Stars all the way!  :)"}
{"text":"Alex was our server and was on pointe and spot on fantastic. The food was tasty and fresh. Fish tacos were amazing and savory good. I will def be back!"}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of places that have some good beer on tap.  I have been to some places that have a good beer special every now and then.  I have never been to such a place that offers 60 HIGH QUALITY craft beers for $2.50 twice a week ( and great $2.50 specials everyday).  Most places dare to even offer Newcastle or Bass for $2.50 and you will not see either one of those beers on tap at Duckworth's.  I'm talkin Founders, Duck Rabbit, Dogfish, PISGAH, and the list goes on and on for $2.50!!  The new location reminds me of Hickory Tavern due to the amount of HDTV's all aorund and decor without the overpriced food.  This place is EXACTLY what South Charlotte (or America) needed.......an unbeievable beer bar with great food and great service.  Now anytime I pay more than $2.50 for ANY beer, much less the quality offered at dworths, I feel ripped off."}
{"text":"$3 craft beer drafts on Thursdays = a beer snob's dream

I live in Jersey City, so to get $3 drafts anywhere is a rarity and a treat. Perhaps I should visit my family in Charlotte more often. Bartenders were friendly and there were TVs everywhere for lots of sports-watching. Crowd seemed a little fratty though."}
{"text":"I got to Duckworths around 6pm on a Wed. it was packed! We had to sit outside because the bar was full. I usually come for the cheesesteaks which are ok (it's to best I can find around me. I'd say a 6 out of 10). When we told are waiter that we weren't ordering food he flaked on us. Sitting outside has its downsides but taking 15 minutes for another beer is a little much. They do however have a hefty choice of beers that I will be back to try... from the bar... inside."}
{"text":"2013 Battle of the Casks is an awesome event. Many of the local breweries are represented with their best casks of beer. We tasted and laughed and \"tasted\" some more in the parking lot, then they moved all the kegs inside for us to continue the party! You stay classy, Duckworth's Grill & Taphouse."}
{"text":"First time visiting last night.  I had the philly cheese steak and it was awesome.  I tried as many of the beers on tap that I could but didn't get too far down the line up since Duckworth's has hundreds of beers on tap.  Great atmosphere, good food and service.  I'll be back"}
{"text":"I like any place that offers a wide variety of beer and not just the same ones over and over. The fact that they have so many different beers on tap and in the bottle means I can always find exactly what im in the mood for. What makes this place amazing though is the food, I have been here several times and I am yet to have anything that is less than amazing."}
{"text":"To highlight from my last experience. Please read below

\"It seems like I am here more than I am at my house. Katie and Larry do an awesome job every time I am here. Tonight... Not so much. Didn't know this bartender but apparently the NFL fantasy football draft was more important than the hungry bar guests sitting directly in front of them. One of which included the manager on a laptop. When I asked to order something I was not heard and the bartender left for a smoke break. Hmmm not a good way to end. Went to spend my money somewhere else. I'll wait for Katie and Larry to be here.\"

The wicked witch is dead.... Kidding... kind of. BUT on the good stuff. Duckworths Management more than made up for the blunder experience. These are great people that want to make sure you are taken care of. As soon as I walked in the door after my review a Kurtis (bar manager) immediately apologized and treated me to a gift card, made sure everything was top notch and has done so every time I have seen him since. Great rebound Duckworths. I shall continue my patronage until the beer ceases to flow. Thanks."}
{"text":"Duckworth's is a great atmosphere filled with good food and great staff. I highly recommend the Cobb Salad with Chicken. It's amazing!"}
{"text":"One of Charlotte's better sports bar type chains.  They have great beer selection with about 40 on tap as well another 40 or so in the bottle.

Their prices might be a few dollars higher than the bigger chain sports bars, but they have a diverse menu:  pizzas, salads, wraps, sandwiches, and tex- mex selections.

An excellent place to view a game.  They have tons of TVs so they can put 8-12 games on at once. I enjoyed being there for an NFL Sunday afternoon.  The crowd was 60%Panther fans with a good number of NFC East fans as well (Cowboys, Giants, Redskins).  It was good crowd with people interested in the games but no one being obnoxious or rude.

I believe a lot of families enjoy coming here mid week as it's fairly kid friendly. I think they have some family specials mid week."}
{"text":"Think sports bar food and variety but delicious - every time! Philly cheesesteak, nachos, BBQ, salad, chicken quesadilla are a few of my favorites."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, excellent staff. Terrific location to watch the game.

Nachos, Philly Cheesesteaks, and Wings are their top dogs."}
{"text":"Lousy service. Four of us sat down at a bar area table. I ordered the draft special, they were out, it was 3:00 pm. Ordered the bottle special, they were out. No offer was made in lieu of deficiency.  Asked for a menu, \"just one?\" was the response.  Ordered several  food items to split, server brought 3 plates and no silverware.  Asked for silverware, she basically ignored us while conversing with what appeared to be a friend at the bar. Went to the bar to get silverware and additional plate. Terrible, terrible, terrible."}
{"text":"First time there. Food was excellent and the service was first class. Make sure you ask for Feye.She gave first class service.. I will go back again."}
{"text":"Good food, Great Drink Prices and a good atmosphere!  Service is pretty good too.  

They have a great draft beer selection and they have a beer/brewery of the month for only $2.50.

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went to Duckworth's for a quick meal one night and it was great! This was my first time there, and our server was super nice and friendly. We didn't have to wait long at all to get our food. I had the Carolina BBQ sandwich, and it was delicious! It was also reasonably priced. I really don't have any complaints and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Not much to analyze....this is more Sysco slop straight off the truck.  Minimal prep required with minimal generic taste to match.  Salads drowned in dressing with the dressing full of enough MSG to swell your ankles up for a week.

Dazzling array of beers tempered by the knowledge that half of them aren't very good.  Must echo the review on this page noting that checking IDs of people obviously well beyond age 21 insults the intelligence of all concerned and tends to sour the relationship with the bartender from the word go.  Smug buttons with 'We ID everybody' don't compensate for legal overkill, intellectual laziness and a lack of common sense.

Too many of today's parents of young children believe that any place serving food is fair game for the little darlings even if the establishment in question is primarily a bar.  One mother, who apparently was an employee but off-duty, brought the little heathen 'Crawford' (groan) over to sit him on the bartop where he grabbed straws and napkins out of the caddy and hurled them in random directions.  Of course, mom thought this was adorable - adults trying to enjoy an adult beverage somewhat less so.

I don't smoke but perhaps a rethink of smoking bans is warranted if it prevents every establishment from becoming a branch of Chuck E. Cheese.

it's a shame that local places have fallen prey to the same assembly line mentality as their corporate competition.  Duckworth's tastes like Chili's tastes like Applebee's tastes like Friday's.   Given that all are buying the same raw materials from the same vendor this shouldn't be a surprise but it is nevertheless discouraging trying to find a place where they actually use recipes rather than reading directions on the side of a box.  The quest continues."}
{"text":"I tried Duckworth's with a group of friends last night celebrating someone's birthday. We arrived around 9:15 and the place was packed. Seeing all of the people there made me excited to try the food. Surely it would be good, I thought. Wrong!

First off, our waiter put my boyfriend's order in wrong. He ordered the barbecue sandwich but somehow our waiter thought he said the Carolina burger? We brought this to the attention of our waiter who called the manager over. The manager very kindly took it off of our ticket. He had ordered the garlic fries as his side and they were so covered in garlic they were inedible. It was like someone took a spoonful of minced garlic and plopped it on top.

I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap. Which, according to the description, was supposed to have chicken, buffalo sauce, ranch, shredded cheese, and field greens. When I got the wrap I couldn't even tell it was buffalo chicken. There was no cheese to be seen and, the grossest part was that the field greens were slimy and wet...like they were scraped from the bottom of a bag. There was no crunch whatsoever. Absolutely disgusting. The fries I got were not hot, nor were they fresh from what I could tell. We brought this to the attention of the waiter, who got his manager, and the manager took it off our check, too.


We are not ones to EVER send food back or complain (we've both worked in the food industry before), but the quality of Duckworth's food was just terrible. I don't think I'll give this place another try. There are too many restaurants in that area that are much better."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night around 6p before it really filled up. We were seated quickly and our drink orders were taken. This place has quite the selection of craft beers on tap, I was amazed at the variety of local beers on draft. We tried some wings and they were incredible good. The pizza was just good but it hit the spot. My buddy's kid ordered a kiddie dish of wings with the sweet bbq sauce and it was a little to spicy for the kid and I was extremely impressed at how one of the staff could tell by observing that something wasn't cool and he came over and asked. He had no problems bringing a new order of wings for the child. Throughout our meal the service was probably some of the best service I have experienced in a long time even for the place being completely packed. 

Be careful though trying to make your way to the restrooms it is a little confusing and it is easy to go into the wrong one if you aren't paying attention. That happened to me HA!"}
{"text":"Best place in town to get a cheesesteak. Service, atmosphere and food are fantastic. Tons of TV's for the big game!  My favorite sub is the chicken philly with cheese whiz."}
{"text":"Solid food, solid service, great draft beer list. Something for everyone on the menu. Lots of TVs but they weren't distracting if you didn't want to watch."}
{"text":"This edition of Exciting about Eating takes us to the Park Road area of Charlotte and to Duckworth's Grill and Taphouse. This neighborhood grill sports a full menu including salads, pizza, steaks, and yes, Philly cheesesteak.

Dora here. Check out that super sweet patio. And we were impressed with the interior. Clean and fresh, not like some pubs that smell like the night before.

For my lunch, I chose the Steak Fajitas served over a bed of sautéed peppers and onions. I chose not to include the beans or rice and opted for a side salad. The fajitas were great. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium with a tender texture. The peppers and onions had just enough crunch, the way I like them, not like a lot of fajitas with overcooked and mushy veggies.

Dora here. Yeah, yeah, I know that people eat with their eyes first and this plate doesn't score points for presentation, but that sirloin was so tender I actually cut it with a butter knife. So maybe I need an update on my eyeglass prescription. lol.

Good thing service was quick and efficient because I drooled over this photo the whole time we waited. I could definitely sink my teeth into this goodie. Didn't tempt hubby, though. Does it do anything for you?

We rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 forks for a family friendly restaurant serving great food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"We moved from the Queen City about 2 years ago, but ANYTIME, and I mean anytime my family returns to visit Charlotte, visiting Duckworth's is a must.
Everything they sell is delish.  Special note for their pizzas, salads, wings and Philly CheeseSteaks.  GARLIC FRIES are a must side.  Trust me try them.
The service is always sincere, and prompt. Food cooked to order, hot and quality.
Longtime server Chris is great!  Kelly also served our family on our most recent visit and she was AWESOME!"}

{"text":"We had wonderful beer, awesome waitress, and great food! My boyfriend and I wanted to try new beers and our waitress gave use three different samples of beers to try. The food was really good. My boyfriend got the Philly Cheesesteak Supreme and he loved it. I had the boneless wings. I loved it too."}

We never get to try anything else bc we always crave their cheese steak with the egg on it!!! the ambiance is chill and the servers are friendly!"}

Good pizza and cheesesteak sammis for food options."}
{"text":"Probably an unfair review since we didn't go inside but I felt compelled to post something about this bar anyway.
We didn't go inside because there appeared to be no less than 50 TV's mounted in the ceiling, row after row, constant motion, constant stuff on all screens (mostly sports).
If you were an ADD sports fan with a drinking issue then this is your heaven on earth.
So while the review may sound negative it could be exactly what someone is looking for, just not us. Sorry."}
{"text":"After eating here I realized that this place is more of a watering hole than a restaurant. Duckworths is a sports bar with a great variety of micro brews. The atmosphere is very laid back but I still don't know why it is called duckworths. I had some mommoo wings and they were pretty good. They had charred edges and a great vinegary flavor. Now the main course I had a balsamic chicken flat bread and this is where is went downhill. The crust was so flimsy all the toppings fell off and the flavors were not very appealing. I ate 2 pieces and gave up it was just poorly made. The place wasn't very busy but I found myself looking for our server a few times for drinks or napkins. This place could be great but right now it is just ok."}
{"text":"I stopped into Duckworth's early evening on a Saturday for a bite to eat before a cut of the hairs. I snagged a stool at the bar and grabbed the beer list. I'd say you are looking at about 50 on tap and 50 more in the bottle. You shouldn't be disappointed with their selection of brews. 

I ordered a cheesesteak sandwich that arrived in no more five minutes! It was average with some fairly standard sweet potato fries. 

I'll be back to check out DWs when Stone Brewing comes to down to take over the taps!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot when in the area for a few days! Can't beat the beer selection, and they have awesome wings and barbecue.  Great lunch and daily specials too."}

  If you want to go to bar with your colleagues in a central atmosphere maybe before or after an event-Duckworth's on North Tryon is the ideal location. Young good looking people  that really are there to make sure you are well served. Very friendly and energetic."}
{"text":"I loved the old Duckworth's, so yesterday we decided to check out the changes.  I reviewed the Huntersville location at 5 stars previously, this one I would give 3.5, kindly bumping it to 4 for Yelp.

We called the Ballantyne location since they are closer to us about dogs on the patio, which they said no, so then we called Park Road and they said yes, so we ended up at the Park Road location.  They immediately seated us on the patio and brought water out for the pup.  A++ on that.

The new menu...while I appreciate the new simplicity, they took away a lot of my favorites.  My favorite app (banana peppers), my favorite drink (peach martini), and some good menu options (wraps).  This is one reason they lose stars for me.  Just sadness to see some great options go.

The food this time (starters)..we started with the fried cauliflower.  I wasn't interested in the sauce choices, so we went with buffalo, which they were willing to do.  It was not what I expected for fried, but it was really good!  However, when I go out, I like things that I don't make at home or would be difficult/time consuming to make at home.  The buffalo cauliflower just tasted like steamed cauliflower in sauce, something I could easily make at home as a side - another reason to miss the banana peppers!  So while I would say it's good, I would not get again.  

The food this time (meal)..Kevin had the chorizo burger and I had the supreme Philly sandwich.  Both were great.  No complaints here.

The new decor...while it is lovely and the patio looks nice, the seating was not comfortable.  I guess they want to get you in and out.

Service was fantastic.  Fast and our server was attentive, bringing us our every request and prompt to refill our drinks.

While I welcome the updates, I also miss the old Duckworth's more."}
{"text":"My cousin has worked the bar scene in Charlotte for a decade and normally takes me to Taco Mac, but with it being a NFL Sunday and Taco Mac slammed we came here. The food is comparable to Taco Mac, as is the service, but this is a smaller footprint with great TV, less noise and a more low-key crowd. She ordered wings, which she enjoyed and I ordered a chicken salad, which was fine. Yep, the food isn't to rave about, but it's puts Hooter's to shame."}
{"text":"I'd give them a 5, but sometimes there is something lacking to my order, or they burn my food. They always make up for it, so I'll still give them a 4, because it is really good when done right!

I Always get the flat bread! Yum!!! I get the margarita and i request the tomatoes to be chopped and extra buffalo mozzarella cheese. It's so good!

I almost always get there scrumptious beer battered onion rings. They come out nice and plump. There are no shrimpy sheds of onion here. 

Recently, I had the cheese sticks and loved them!! The outside is nice. It's not that crumbly seams almost like hard little pieces of corn. It's awesome! Highly recommend them!!

The last time I sat outside and the first pizza was burnt, and the second was cold. The manager apologized, he would have made another, but I felt like two times was enough to wait. He took it off the bill and sent me on my way with some hot tasty donuts."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches.  Haven't been to the new location yet but, I'm sure it's just as good.  Ask for the Sriracha sauce; they keep it hidden in the back.
*Update: Just visited the new place.  Much better location and interior.  Lots of TVs, nice layout and HUGE beer menu."}
{"text":"Great place, great food, great service all around. Big selection of beer, and you are able to sample if you prefer before you order your drink. Manager checks on your table to make sure we are getting great service, gentleman that waited on us was so very polite. We will defiantly be returning with family and friends."}
{"text":"The remodel of the place looks great.  They are hand breading the tenders now, much better than before.  Cheese steaks are still great.  We will continue to visit this location."}
{"text":"This is a great place in Charlotte! They have a ton of draft beers on tap and the food is amazing! We got the buffalo chicken pizza and it was so delicious! It was huge and we are left overs the next day. We also got the twisted chicken sandwich but per the waitress's suggestion we made it a wrap. So delicious! Blacken chicken with some spicy mayo and I recommend a side of garlic fries. You won't be disappointed. This is one of the best restaurants in Charlotte and the staff is awesome! Super nice and attentive and the managers are fantastic. I highly recommend stopping by one night."}
{"text":"Can't wait to try this place again!  Excellent beer and food selection!  I think anyone would be able to find something to their liking here!  The menu looked so go I had a hard time deciding what to get.  I went with the cheese steak and it was yummy!  Bread tasted super fresh too which I LOVE!"}
{"text":"Compared with Duckworth's in Ballantyne, this place was a bit of a disappointment last time. While service in Ballantyne is ridiculously friendly and helpful, the waitress at this branch was fine but not very accomodating to special requests. We asked to get nachos without sour cream and with a little more salsa instead. Out came nachos WITH sour cream and an extra ketchup-container of salsa for which we were charged 1.50 dollar. 

Their draft beer list also seems to have shrunk quite a bit and is now much shorter than at the Ballantyne location. Not sure if this is temporary of not."}
{"text":"Best wings ever....can't remember a better wing. The wings that won 1st place and 3rd place at the NC wing contest were fabulous. Seasoned and marinated. Crunchy fried drenched in sauce and then chargrilled....wow.... 113 beers I had the stop drop and roll twice. I have to visit 112 more times. Service was also great....Amanda did an awesome job explaining types of beers and procedures and recommendations.  Will be in Charlotte much more. Let's go Panthers. Televisions are at every angle you turn your head. Thumbs all the way up. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Duckworths has without a doubt the best micro beer selection in town.  Sure, they only have 20 taps but those 20 are GREAT and Tues & Thurs all drafts are only $2.50!  Plus they have $2.50 draft specials EVERYDAY of the week.  Last visit they had 4 Founders taps, Allagash White, Gordon & Ten Fidy from Oscar Blues, DFH 90, Foothills Hoppyum, and many more.  PLUS they go to Black Mountian and bring back Pisgah beer....the only place in Charlotte that carries Pisgah.

The food is always fresh and very good, the pizza and cheese steaks are excellent.  BUT the fried pickles at Duckworths are the best in town...yes, better that the Penguin's!!  They are always crisp (not greasy or soggy) and you get a large serving.  

Again, the best beers and deals in town."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, and if I went there for beer and food, I may have liked it better. That said, I just stopped in for a quick lunch. Very extensive menu from apps, to salads, to pizzas, to sandwiches to regular entrees. They ride themselves (food wise) on the sub sandwiches, especially the philly. I went with the buffalo chicken philly which came with ranch, swiss and buffalo sauce with chopped up chicken. Comes in two sizes....7\" and 10\". 7\" was $7.99 and the 10\" is $10.99. Went with the 7\" as I wasn't looking to roll out of the place after wards. 

Now my issue...those prices do not come with any sides. They offer a \"make it a meal\" for $3.50 which includes a side & drink. Since I got an iced tea I went with a side of sweet potato fries, which were really good. However; for $11.49, my plate was no where near the size or the quality for that price. I couldn't imagine getting the 10\" for almost $15! 

The beer menu was extensive and impressive, and I'll be sure to check it out one more time for the beers since I didn't on this recent trip."}
{"text":"We had been wanting to go to Duckworth's, but we normally went to its neighbor, Mama Fu's, instead.  Fortunately for Duckworth's, we got there and discovered that Mama Fu's had closed.  Huh.  So we finally got to give Duckworth's a try and weren't disappointed.  

We walked in and saw that the dining room was just one long aisle.  It didn't look too inviting, but it was a nice night out, so we decided to sit outside.  The service was great.  Our server was on top of things, even with the drunks next to us.  He was very cordial to them even though they were being pretty stupid.  

We had the kids with us so instead of trying their cheesesteaks (it's in the name, so they have to be good!), we decided to order two large pizzas to split.  The Meatza Pizza sounded delicious with its salami, sausage, Canadian bacon, pepperoni, AND regular bacon.  And -- BONUS! -- that just happened to be their \"special\" monthly pizza, on sale for $5 off!  The pizza was delicious, moist, and very flavorful; not dull or dry at all.  We were very impressed!  Next time we'll definitely try the cheesesteaks!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our Easter lunch here. We got the mozzarella sticks (which were awesome) a crispy chicken Caesar salad (which was good) a margarita flat bred (which had great flavor but had WAY too much olive oil on it, so ask for light oil) and a Philly cheesesteak (their cheesesteak was supposed to be the reason the restaurant opened but it wasn't good. It was just a bland cheesesteak. I've tasted a lot of cheesesteaks, and have even lived in Philly, and this one was nothing special) The price of the food is expensive for it just being bar food in a bar atmosphere, which was the ultimate reason why this review gets 3 stars instead of 4. I liked how all of the waiters and waitresses worked together as a team, especially since our waitress seemed to forget about us, like one waiter brought our food, and another one bused some dishes as he was walking by and saw they were empty. As a past waitress, I can appreciate the team effort. I would come back to eat here again, just pay more attention to the prices since they're a little high."}
{"text":"Beer, Beer, Beer, Beer....All this fabulous beer that I have never heard of....I will have the Bud Light Please!!!  Seriously, that's really pretty much all I drink!! 

I have come in late at night after work and have sat inside and out on the patio both are great! The service has been hit or miss but I think for the most part its been very good! The bartenders know everything about the beer so no problems there!! The prices are really reasonable too!! 

The food has been good, Nachos being my favorite! The burgers are good as well with the french fries! I think it adds something great to Montford !!"}
{"text":"It's like Applebee's  But, local!

I'd take my dad here.  In fact, I did."}
{"text":"Great location food was good the restaurant  air conditioner  wasn't  working so had to eat outside  to be comfortable."}
{"text":"Expensive bar food and expensive beer, but some beers are worth the price.  Highly suggest going on $3 pint nights.

I went on a Friday night and 9 kegs had been tapped out and weren't replaced.  One of which was the special of the day.  If you are out of your special, make something else cheaper.  I had already eaten dinner, so I didn't need any of their overpriced food.  After I drank my one beer we left.  Outside of pint nights, I just don't think this place is for me."}
{"text":"We came out to Duckworth's after bowling and drinks over on South Tryon. I'd been to the location in Huntersville and really enjoyed that one, so I was excited about trying the Park Road location. When we got there and turned in from the street, I was worried that parking would be an issue, because the lot looked really narrow. We all found spots no problem, and there was a decent amount of people inside. When we left, I noticed street parking that I'm sure alleviates some of the issues that may come with a small-ish parking lot. Next time I go, I'll check to see if there is an adjoining lot in the back. Anyway, we get inside and it's bright with lots of TVs and a really diverse crowd. The hostess seats us promptly and we start perusing the menu. My sister and I decided on the salmon salad, my date ordered the famous Bold n Gold wings (24 of them, yes we all judged him lol), and my brother in law ordered the burger. We didn't have drinks since we'd been drinking at the bowling alley, but I'll definitely review those the next time we stop in. The salmon salad was delish! Crispy outside and warm, flaky inside, with just the right amount of seasoning. My date smashed his wings and fries, and took the rest home to eat while watching the game the next day. My brother in law was thoroughly impressed with his burger too. All-in-all, it was a really great dining experience and we all agreed we'd totally go back. The bathrooms were clean enough, though I only ran in quickly to wash my hands before eating. Can't speak for the stalls. I'm deducting a star because I got sick once I got home. :/ It didn't feel like food poisoning, so I'm for sure going to check Duckworth's out again. Maybe next time to watch a game and have some drinks!!"}
{"text":"Quack, Quack!!!!  I asked my cousins where to get some sweet potato fries and she recommended Duckworth's. I proceed to look up the menu online.....the food items listed sounded very appetizing so I called in an order os Sweet Potato Fries ( with sweet sauce---sweet butter, cinnamon & sugar) YUMMY!! I also ordered loaded nachos which consisted of nachos with chicken, onions, tomato, cheese, guacamole,  sour cream & jalapeño. I picked up my food at the bar. They were very polite and friendly!! The food was ALL that and then some!!!! I will definitely go back. I had to force myself not to go back again today. A definite go to Spot,! ,!"}
{"text":"Bartender was nice but not very attentive. Food is EXTREMELY slow! We came on a Friday and the place was next to empty and it took over thirty minutes for our food"}
{"text":"Great beers! Foods ok. But I don't go there for the food. Make sure you have a DD. Tues and Thur $3 after tax beers."}
{"text":"I went here with Andrew H. so that's an automatic +1 star rating. Not that this place needs it - their beer selection is quite nummy. 

After a tasty dinner at Three Amigos my buddy and I decided to come on over to the best part of Montford for a few drinks and to chill on the patio and enjoy the spring sun. The waiter was super helpful on our arrival and recommended some brews that we were sure to enjoy.

After finishing my first stout I spotted that they sell $6 beer samplers. This is a GREAT deal because they have quite an extensive menu. I generally know what I want in a beer so everything I sampled was good (I think 2 more stouts, an IPA and a Hefeweizen). My buddy also got a sampler so we were able to mix and match.

All in all a good spot. I look forward to trying their food on the next visit."}
{"text":"Did not know that they stayed open late! My husband and I were looking for a good bite and nice place to chill at 11pm on a Friday night. They serve food till midnight. Staff was friendly, food came out fast and was delicious! Two thumbs up for the chorizo burger"}
{"text":"Went to meet a friend and was excited about the beer selection. $3.50 draft night was great. However, our server gave us the feeling that we were more of an inconvenience for him. Wasn't very welcoming. The buffalo blue cheese chips could have used more toppings. My boyfriend ordered the pizza special. You receive 9 toppings for $11.99. He informed our server that he was a pescatarian (only eats seafood). The server had to ask the kitchen if he could substitute shrimp. Of course the answer was yes. About two slices in, not realizing because of how hungry we were, he noticed bacon pieces all over the pizza. When we told the server his response was \"I'll have them make another one.\" No apology or expression at all. After that of course we didn't want another one. Took about 5 minutes for the manager to come over. Of course he apologized and took the pizza off. Feeding meat to someone that doesn't eat meat is a pretty big deal. The pizza was taken off but that was it. They even left the pizza on the table. Why would we want a reminder of the mistake that occurred and stare at a pizza you can't eat. I expect a lil more compensation for something like that. Not looking for a free meal in any way. In a situation like that, i would expect more than just taking off the mistake. I just there needs to be more personality and care from the employees and management."}
{"text":"Let's keep it short and sweet...here's everything you need to know about this place:

Yes parking sucks...

BUT

$3.50 drafts Tuesday and Thursday! 

Yep! Over 50 drafts on tap! It's okay go ahead and do your happy dance. I know I did! 

Order the Smothered Fries! Don't even think about passing these up. They are worth every bite. Not to mention they use REAL bacon, load them up with cheese and give you a side of ranch dressing for dipping. Shut up. So good. 

Am I a fan?! Of course!"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was completely disgusting. We ordered from the late night menu, I got the veggie fajitas beans and rice. They left out my tortillas in my Togo order the beans and rice were disgusting. My best friend ordered the fish tacos which ended up being some sort of strange shredded fish. My boyfriend got the salmon salad, which was ok but would've been better but the salmon was dry. They left out my garlic fries and on top of all of this disgusting food it was 91$!!! I will never eat here ever again"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, huge menu!  The bacon on the Club Sub is tasty.  Fries are fresh cut and rustic.  But the real star is the beer selection.  Although I'm not a beer drinker so I don't really seek them out, I haven't seen a longer bar with as many beers on tap in this town.  

I'll be back for the food and look forward to spreading the word that there's a new awesome sports bar in town.  And I can't remember the last time I wrote that out loud!"}
{"text":"Slow service. Cold food. Spoiled meat on the chef salad. The manager comp'ed our entire meal... Yep it was that bad!"}
{"text":"Two more visits. Everything still excellent including some of the best pizza. I haven't seen this much oil in the bottom of a pan since I switched my car to Pennzoil.  Damn it was good."}
{"text":"Duckworth's is a staple, \"go to\" each weekend! Their beer list is sure to have something for everyone with three entire pages of selections. Service is incredible and food even better. I can't last a week without their Grilled Chicken Caesar wrap and homemade chips!"}
{"text":"Where to start? Alright, first they have an amazing beer list with locals and traditionals. Waiter knew his stuff, Kyle? I believe, and did a great job with recommendations for the beer fans at my table. 

So the pizza was outstanding my husband says and it looked good too! The other guest at our table and I tried the philly cheese steaks....I have to be honest and say it was 'ok' but nothing I was melting over. Atmosphere was great and if we lived in the area I would go back and continue to explore the menu."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, and yes! After starving for the entire day (from losing my keys and looking for them the entire day.... yup, it was one of those nights), I told my friend I wanted to eat the heartiest meal ever. MEAT PLEASE!

So I decided to get the chicken wings and pork ribs combo. I'm such a fan when ribs are tender. My face simply lights up like a mofo. The wings were less desired but still have an honorable mention. On both, I chose the Sweet n' Bold Gold Sauce but next time, I'm definitely getting the garlic parm wings!!!! (Two of my favorites)

For the sides, the tater tots were the BOMB dot com. It was cooked perfectly where it's crispy on the outside and softer inside. But the sauteed veggies were extremely thin and watery.

So if you ever lose your keys and are almost starving to death, get my meal! It'll totally satisfy your needs."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in here over the weekend as I had heard about the great beer selection.  We had no idea what to expect otherwise and we were pleasantly surprised.  The beer selection is outstanding and well priced.  Looking at the specials menu, it seems like they have great specials everyday of the week!
We tried the wings and they were amazing!  The menu is pretty extensive and is better than the average bar food... I had tacos and my boyfriend opted for the Carolina BBQ.  We were both very happy with our meals.  The portions were also very generous so we had leftovers.
Prices are reasonable and this place is very casual and has a good atmosphere. It's a great place to grab dinner or just grab a beer in the bar and watch a game.  Lots of TVs all around.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and it has always been an exceptional experience. The servers are always quick, friendly, and attentive. The food is always delicious and my favorite thing to get usually is one of their burgers. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Yummy food, awesome draft beer, and great service in a casual and fun atmosphere.  I have been driving by all of their locations and I am happy that I finally decided to stop in on Park Road.  Ryan was funny and took great care of us....and the food was delicious, upscale comfort food."}
{"text":"The hubby and I enjoy Duckworth's and we try to make it here weekly for the awesome beer special ($2.50 pints on Tuesdays and Thursdays).  This is Mr. P's favorite bar/restaurant because of the reasonable price and extensive selection of draft beer.  I'm not a huge beer drinker myself but even I get excited reading the beer menu.  My husband, on the other hand, acts like a kid in a candy store and spends a ridiculous amount of time salivating over the beer menu while trying to make his selections.  The restaurant is in a great location (park road shopping area) and the management and servers are extremely friendly and helpful.  If you have a hard time deciding on a beer the servers are more than happy to let you try samples before committing.  The dining area indoors is a little boring (off white walls with little to no decorations), but the outdoor area is nice with plenty of people watching.  And, if you're lucky, you can sometimes even hear the trivia from across the street at Angry Ale's in the evening.  The menu is pretty decent with a good variety of appetizers, salads, sandwiches, pizzas and entrees.  I highly recommend the cobb salad.  It's easily enough for 2 meals and so delicious loaded up with a balance of healthy (lots of veggies and grilled chicken) and unhealthy (blue cheese, cheddar, bacon, yum!)   toppings.  I always dread trying to find a parking spot in their tiny parking lot.  You're usually better off just parking along the street.  Overall, if you are (or want to become) a beer drinker this is definitely a place you need to try."}
{"text":"Recently stopped into Duckworths after a day spent on Montford Drive. This was my firist visit to this location, since the one at Ballantyne is just around the corner from work & home.  On this vist, we were just stopping in for drinks and did not have anything to eat. The place was not tremendously busy since we arrived before busy dinner hour. However, service was a bit on the slow side. Of course, they have a great selection of beer, so that sort of helps make up for the so-so service."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch one day and the food was surprisingly fresh for a bar type environment. The only downside was the noise level and this was during the lunch hour. Other than that, it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"great place to hang and watch sports .... great beer from what i hear (not a beer fan)..Food is always spectacular  and we always have had excellent service...."}
{"text":"Me and two other people went to Duckworth for the first time and it was after 10pm, so it was one of the few restaurants open during the week at this time so we thought we'd try it out. We walk in and it looked pretty empty but it didn't matter cause we were hungry. There was someone sitting at the host stand and we were waiting for her to greet us and she just stared at us and when we asked where we sit or what we do she just said someone is about to come. We end up finding out that it was the manager, which was very unprofessional how she treated us. I even asked if they needed bartenders and the server told me she'd come talk to me and she never did. The server was very nice and welcoming and explained the menu thoroughly. When the beer samples came out she didn't tell us which sample was what, which made it confusing to choose. The food was tasty, but my friend said the burger he got wasn't medium well as he asked. Me and my boyfriend got sweet potato fries and asked for honey mustard. The honey mustard was very zesty which is unusual for honey mustard, it was almost spicy. Overall I enjoyed this experience but as a fellow bartender/past server I would've done things differently."}
{"text":"A very tasty cheese steak and home made chips. The server was pleasant and efficient in waiting on me."}
{"text":"If beer heaven was a place, and I'm not ruling out the possibility that it is, Duckworth's is on the shortlist for hosting duties. They boast 40 taps plus a plethora of bottled choices and the beer menu, a four page, single spaced affair, backs them up. As for food, the menu covers nearly every corner of American cuisine, from ribs to wings to pizza to Philly cheesesteaks.

To beer fans I cannot recommend the sampler highly enough: for $5 you a 4.5 oz glass of any 4 beers on tap. We visited shortly after a Stone tap takeover so that fine brewery had a draft plurality and since their choices were rarer the Stone sampler was $8, but still well worth it since it gave the opportunity to compare across the brand. All bottled choices are available for takeout, so consider bringing a treat home for your own brew reserve.

The food is enjoyable but not exceptional. I has a meatball sub with sweet potato fries. The meatballs were distinctly not house-made, but I wouldn't really expect otherwise from a one-stop shopping style kitchen. My roommate had a cheesesteak and it avoided the common misstep of being either overly greasy or juicy. All in all a solid effort.

The atmosphere was clean and more stylish than the 6 tvs above the bar broadcasting various sports events might make you expect. The staff was friendly though a bit slow and our check had to be corrected due to erroneous splitting.

Next time I OD on PBR I know where I'll be going to renew my faith in craft beer, and Duckworth's is that place."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed, disappointed and regretful. Those three words sum up my visit to Duckworth's Grill & Taphouse. I brought a large group here on a Saturday evening (they weren't too busy when we got there) at the recommendation of a friend and I found it to be completely disappointing. We had 7 in the group. Everything about the place was disappointing. We weren't asked for a drink order for 15 minutes; our food order wasn't taken for 45 minutes to an hour; the food came another 30 minutes later; and the food was well below average. I ordered a 16 oz porterhouse steak with sweet potato fries and grilled veggies. The porterhouse was a little overcooked and had a mushy exterior with no grill marks or char as if it had been cooked on a grill that wasn't hot enough (or a Foreman grill). The sweet potato fries were decent but there were hardly any of them. The grilled veggies were mushy and served in a pool of what appeared to be oil...yuck. They did have a decent sample of beers here which is nice but I would never go here again for a meal. All told I left feeling like I had wasted 2 plus hours of my life waiting on food that I'd rather have not have eaten."}
{"text":"Sunday 12/17. Our family of four, including myself, walk in around 8 for a couple drinks and some dinner. As a side note, the place was barely a quarter full at this time so there should be no excuse for slow service. The first issue we encountered was waiting 30 minutes, yes you read that right, for our beers. Our waiter quickly brought them to the table after complaining as to where they were. Besides the incredibly slow service, which seems to have reputation around that establishment, the worst part of the night was encountering Alyssa, the store manager. She was by far the rudest manager I've ever \"met\". Besides comping one of our dinners they messed up, which still took an hour to serve, she had the audacity to raise her tone of voice and talk back to us when telling her about the poor service we received that night. I rarely write reviews but because the way we were treated by Alyssa and the poor service, I felt inclined to let other's know to avoid that spot. Between slow service and awful, AWFUL customer service from the staff, especially Alyssa, we will no longer eat at that establishment and would recommend others to find a better place to eat instead."}
{"text":"I would like to start out by saying that this was my first time visiting Duckworth.  My experience with this restaurant was amazing.  The food was amazing and the server was on top of his job. The atmosphere was comfortable. I have to say that I have found a wonderful place to go hang out to eat and enjoy nice people."}
{"text":"We have been to this location many times and I always have amazing service! The food is incredible and the service is awesome. I love that you can get char grilled wings and the beer selection is like no other in Charlotte! You'd be crazy not to make this part of your lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"We spontaneously stopped by here in hopes of getting a table quickly because we were getting hangry. The guy told us it would be 25-30 minutes and we ended up getting a table in about 15 minutes. The service was super slow and the food took forever to come out. I don't know if that was the hunger talking, but it literally felt like we've been sitting there forever. I ordered the Baja Fish Tacos and I really enjoyed the pineapple chunks in the tacos and in the salsa. The chips that came with the taco were so salty that salt would fall and stick to my fingers. My tacos needed more seasoning because it was pretty bland. We also witnessed a couple sitting there for quite sometime without a single person coming by to even ask what they wanted to drink. The couple angrily stood up and left in a hurry. They left so fast that the lady left her purse in the restaurant. That's not okay! I honestly don't know if I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place has great food and great beer. The cheesesteaks are absolutely amazing. I had the supreme with tots. I have also had the smokehouse cheesesteak which is also fantastic. I would definitely recommend anyone to come here."}
{"text":"I love the remolded Duckworth's! Food was great! Th  manager was very friendly and knowledgeable. The restaurant smelled so good! Which made me eager to eat! I will be back!"}
{"text":"They have a policy of carding everyone who orders alcohol.  I think those policies are too rigid and just kinda harass people who are plenty old enough to drink.  I refuse to order alcohol at and place with such policies.

For those of you who don't care about my stand against invading privacy...their food is really good.  Much better than other places in town with so many beers (Taco Mac, Flying Saucer).  Their cheesesteaks are the signature dish, but even their salads are pretty good.  
They have a great selection of beer and run good specials during the week (now $3.50, formerly $3) on pints so the bar gets packed on those nights.  
Parking is a problem since the lot in front is small so you may need to park on Montford or in the adjacent shopping center and walk."}
{"text":"First Duckworths I visited, still a favorite even if I don't frequent this as often as I'm not on this side of town as much. Still highly recommend, though Montfort has a lot of other great offerings."}
{"text":"Dined in once, did take out once. Food was vey tasty on both occasions. The staff is very friendly and fun to converse with. I found myself eating just apps instead of an entrée and was perfectly satisfied doing so. Boneless wings - juicy and flavorful. Mozzarella sticks/fried cheese - the best I've had yet!"}
{"text":"Decent place in Charlotte to get beers, food and to watch a game. 

The draft list was a bit overwhelming to read since it was in an excel spreadsheet on a piece of paper and tiny to read. I will have to say that there were a lot of higher gravity options which I prefer not to have while enjoying a longer game so I went with an Allagash White with an orange slice. 

For food, we started out with the Buffalo Bleu Cheese Chips which were great. For my meal, I decided to go with the Gorgonzola and Apple Flatbread with a side salad while Boyfriend ordered the Cobb Salad. Food was decent, nothing to write home about. 

My one complaint was when we were leaving the hostess kept asking us multiple questions about how our visit was. I thought that a simple, have a great day and thank you for coming would do."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite spot! The food was great, I had the chicken pesto sandwich and yum! It was delicious. My husband had ribs and wings, both great. The grilled corn is amazing too. 

I am not a beer drinker but our server Ryan noticed that I like Frambois and suggested some different beers that were really good! We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Duckworth's to watch Sunday football.  A large group of us sat at the long high top table in the bar area.  
We had awesome service with David!  The nachos are a must try and the extensive beer list was great.  Thumbs up all around.
We were able to see all of the games unlike a lot of other local bars.  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I've been rocking with Duckworth's since 2009 when it was Duckworth's Cheese Steakery on Park Rd. Their food is very savory and delcious. If you're a beer lover, they have tons of beer on tap. They know how to do a cheese steak! I always get their Chicken Philly Cheesteak with garlic fries because it's the best chicken philly in town! You can't go wrong with their farlic fries. I like to add some old bay to my griws for an extra zip. I have alwways had great service here too. The parking is a little tight, so be cautious. 

If you want a more unique Duckworth experience, check out their new establishment, The Cellar at Duckworth's in their location uptown. You'll be taken back to the roaring 20s in the cellar of a speakeasy with delcious small plates, tons of worldy beers and hand crafted cocktails."}
{"text":"Visit this location often. Been here for college football bowl games or with the family on a Friday night. More restaurant than sport bar. Very accommodating staff and the menu has enough options to please the full group. Food is good, not amazing, but also priced reasonably. The beer options are overwhelming, which is good. Where I am from \"4 stars out of 5\" is good and Duckworth's is well worth return visits."}
{"text":"This place does not disappoint!  Their chicken fajita salad and their philly cheesesteak are amazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent selection with knowledgeable staff!  Gorgonzola & apple flatbread was delicious - way better than you would expect from a bar!  Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Duckworth's is a great place for anyone who loves beer. They have a great selection of beers which can sometimes be overwhelming. I asked the waiter for a suggestion and he was very helpful and educated on the beer list. I had a Great Lakes Christmas Ale and have been trying to find them in the store ever since! He made sure we didn't ever have an empty glass through the night and had lots of suggestions. 
The menu is very extensive and I have always really liked the options I've tried. This visit, I had a bacon chicken wrap and french fries. No complaints! It's really good bar food, it's not a 5 star restaurant. 
Good service, good food, great beer!"}
{"text":"I'm not a beer conisseur so the 60 taps all standing tall do little for me.   Beyond that I don't see how this place is a riff on the iconic Philly cheese steak sandwich.   I agree with reviews that Duckworth's is like so many other large sports-bar-type watering holes with good,  but just OK food.   Taco Mac, Chilli's, Hickory Tavern, Applebee's, etc.  Not for me unless with a group hoisting our participation trophy."}
{"text":"The BBQ sandwich at $8.99 with slaw & garlic fries (best garlic fries I've ever tasted) was fantastic. Sunday $4 Mimosa topped it off. The beer selection is amazing! Staff and bartenders are friendly and welcoming. Great place to hang for sports!"}
{"text":"Loved the hostess Camille, who is a dedicated and authentic Seahawks fan. If you smack talk her when your team is playing the Hawks, she'll give it right back to you. Made my first experience here memorable! #whodey"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good service. Good energy. Great beer selection. Nice decor. Respectable food.
Thursday night food service is very slow.
Not a good Panthers bar as their policy is to play multiple other games."}
{"text":"Duckworth's is a cool spot.  I have been going to this location since they opened.  Their food used to be better priced.   what happened to $7 chicken nachos ya bastids? Their beer menu as of late can be very hit or miss.  I think they need to get more locals in like trip C, birdsong, noda, and mix it with rarer beers to this area.  It is usually a decent time, but some things have changed for the worst."}
{"text":"so good! great food, great drinks, and titi our server was PHENOMENAL will definitely be visiting again-especially if she's working!"}
{"text":"The beers are excellent.  HUGE selection, including lots of obscure and local stuff.
The wings are very good. 
The rest of the food is decent but certainly not special.

Treat this place like a beer joint and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Fajita Quesdilla was huge but the cheese didn't have much taste.  Great location & good service.  Salads are huge.  Standard pub fare."}
{"text":"Great location off of Park Road! I've passed this place numerous times and finally decided to drop in with some friends.

They have an overwhelming amount of beers...in a good way if you want to try something new. However, if you have problems making a decision, do not look at the beer list. $2.50 pint specials on a certain selection of beers on Thursdays makes for a nice time out! I didn't eat anything during this visit, but the menu looked like a typical bar menu with salads, sandwiches, etc. They stay open with full-menu until 2am.

Smoking is allowed on the patio, there are tvs lining the walls, and did I mention they have a lot of beer?! Go enjoy a night out at Duckworth's!"}
{"text":"The food was quick and delicious but the service was bad..our waitress seemed lost and even charged our credit card the wrong amount...i woukd go back but i need a different waitress"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never given Duckworth's a Yelp Review before!!! What the F$%@# was I thinking? Easily the best BEER bar in Charlotte, with about 60 on Tap and many more available by the bottle.

It's not huge in there, but they do have a nice bar area which can get quite crowded, especially at peak times (e.g., sporting events on TV). 

The service is always good, and the food surprisingly is good too! You never know what you'll be getting food wise at a bar, but Duckworth's delivers in all areas. I'd say their food is 3.5 to 4.0 stars. I mean, I wouldn't come out of my way for the food, but it's the incredible selection of draft and bottled beers that draw people to this place.

They of course serve a large selection of NC-made beers, but also have some HEAVY hitting micro-brews from all over the world. Me being a Strong Belgian ale kinda guy, I am always drawn to a great Gulden Draak, which they have ON TAP. Also have a nice selection of \"high gravity\" beers, many over 10% ABV. 

If you love beer, this is your place. I like Duckworth's SO much better than World of Beer (no food, WTF?) and Flying Saucer up north. But those places also serve a nice selection of beers. Maybe because Duckworth's is in my neighborhood AND it has a great vibe is why I like it so much.

But if you're into great beers, good food and a place that won't force you to miss your monthly mortgage payment, come check out Duckworth's."}
{"text":"Yes the beer list is extensive but staff is always willing to help!  Great food and atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"I have been hearing about Duckworths for quite some time so my wife and I decided to give it a shot. We were not disappointed.

The place is a little on the small side, just one aisle of booths and tables. There is also a seperate small bar area at the front of the space. Several TV's. Not big on the atmosphere. The only saving grace in this area is the outside seating.

The food is decent. We split a full cheesesteak, and the blue cheese chips. Not the greatest cheesesteak but not bad at all. A good value for the price.

The waitstaff is pretty good, they seem to be on top of things. Checked in on us often, made sure we had everything that we needed, and weren't too pushy. 

Duckworths is  a beer-centric place with a great beer menu. They currently have 20 beers on tap, and are constantly rotating their tap list to keep it interesting. Another thing that I really like is that they know how to serve their beer, in the correct glassware, at the right temperature. They are not serving Natty lite in a frosted mug. They have a very good list of bottles available too. They have great specials too Mon & Wed is $2.50 local (N.C.) drafts, Tues & Thurs is $2.50 all drafts, Fri, Sat & Sun they pick 2 or 3 draft to be $2.50.

I understand that they are in the process of moving into a larger space on Park Rd. I believe they said they should be operational by the end of May. I am told they will have 60 beers on tap, and 3 casks

All in all a great place for a beer fan, a family, or just someone looking for a decent meal at a reasonable price.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
UPDATE

Duckworths has recently opened their new location on Park Rd. and it is terrific. The place is much larger and more up to date than the previous location. 

The service is as good as ever and now they have 60 taps with some great craft beers and a cask engine. Really the premier spot for craft beer in the Charlotte area.

I am really impressed, I am usually there at least once a week and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"If I could leave zero stars I would. We went to eat Saturday night around 5:30 and had a dark haired waitress. She got our drinks out promptly but then took 25 minutes to come back and ask us what we wanted to eat. I wanted one of their flatbreads but as a pizza. Seems simple enough, right? Well.... the food didn't come out until 6:30-6:45. Mind you there was maybe three tables in the entire restaurant at this point. All of the servers were talking at the hostess stand and my waitress was no where to be found. She didn't check in once and neither did a manager. When the food finally came out a blonde manager brought it out and apologized on it taking so long. There was no explanation as to why it took so long. And if she brought it out she must have known it took a long time- if she was aware why had she not greeted the table within the hour of us waiting for our food? So anyways.. she brings the food out and my order was wrong. It was a flatbread. So she apologized and it told me it would take another five minutes. Twenty minutes later after everyone is done with their food my personal size pizza finally comes out. Terrible service and terrible management. Will not be back."}
{"text":"This is a fancy restaurant. However they accommodated me at the bar as I wore jean that night. 

Their wine is excellent. Their lamb shank is pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Good beer. Great bartender.  Definitely would recommend. Make sure to try their cheese steak, fries and deal of the day. It's a good atmosphere and is nice for close friends, couples and coworkers. I'd recommend it anytime!"}
{"text":"This place has a fun atmosphere! I got the chicken nachos and they were really good and huge!"}
{"text":"Been to this location a few times and twice since reopening. Service is great and has been every time.  The last two times I have ordered the Big Bad Burger and this last time it was just a little over cooked (Requested Medium , came close to medium well)  but was still tasty and tender. Ordered the house cut fries and they were great as well. I feel this is a great spot to grab good food or go to watch a game !  Not a drinker but I have always heard they have a great beer selection."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this gem on accident when trying to find a place to grab a bite, but not being from the area. Good Lord was I happy to find this place and its 150 beers on tap. My friend and I were literally amazed by the wall of beer choices and the even larger number of TVs. (I straight up asked the waiter how many there were.) Regardless, we were given the drink menu-which was an iPad- that had not only the regular choices, but also any type of mix you could imagine. Then there was the food menu, pretty much anything that you may crave while drinking. Flatbreads, tacos, cheesecake, you name it. We ordered and waited only about 15 min for the food, which tasted pretty good. I recommend the flatbread over my wrap but hey, both were satisfying.
The only reason I gave this place 4 instead of 5 stars was the wait staff. They were pretty unhappy to be there. I've worked in food & bev and no one wants a boring waiter. 
Nonetheless, I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good place to grab a drink. It can hold just a few people or large parties..not to mention there is a different TV and beer for everyone!!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was fabulous. We come here occasionally and always enjoy and today we decided to come after church and the service was exceptional as well as the food. I had the Chorizo Burger and I would eat it daily if my wife would let me. Tremendous choices of craft beers but also domestics for those that don't like to try new things. I cannot say how great this place is."}
{"text":"I stopped by Duckworth's Kitchen & Taphouse when checking out the Ballantyne area of Charlotte after a friends wedding in South Carolina. First off the Ballantyne area of Charlotte is super nice. A plethora of huge corporate buildings and nice homes and shops. Most of the restaurants I saw were chains that I had already been to and I wanted to try something new and different. This lead me to Duckworth's.

I sat at the bar to watch some of the US Open golf. They have an insane amount of beers on tap and I had a couple of lemon Kolsch which were really good. The food menu is fairly typical for this kind of restaurant/bar with offerings of wings, burgers, cheesesteaks, pizza, sandwiches, and salads. I decided on the BBQ sandwich with onion rings and it was satisfying (About as good as you would expect outside of Eastern NC). 

Actually, Duckworth's is somewhat of a mini-chain with several locations in the Charlotte area (I asked). It's really not that unique inside or with the food they offer. I would compare it to a Carolina Ale House, but slightly better. I am giving 4 stars because I was pleased overall with my choice to stop by Duckworth's."}
{"text":"The best part about coming to Duckworth's is the beer. With that being said, the best days to come and enjoy a beer are Tues & Thurs when most of the 50 or so beers they have on draft are $3.00. Those are the best nights to come and experiment with new beers and try something different. The food is a little bit above average bar food, nothing special going on here. The service isn't bad either. Be warned, if you come on $3 beer night it might be tough to find a table."}
{"text":"After driving place after place last night trying to find something good we decided on Duckworths.  We get there walk in the manager is on the phone having a personal phone call.  I asked should we seat ourselves or what because it had been about 3 minutes or so and she had not so much as acknowledged us.  Then she pulls the phone away from her head and asks one of the servers to please seat us.  He asks us where we preferred to sit and we ended up picking the dark booth.  He explained the options and specials and tells us about the specials.  Not sure what his name was but he was super nice.  Looking at the menus we see that alot has changed here.  I didn't know this until reading some other reviews but they relaunched recently and changed a lot of stuff.  Our server came and told us that yes they are testing new concepts for the chain.  I ended up getting a burger with sweet potato fries and it was pretty good except I received the burger well instead of medium like I requested since they asked.  My friend's got a order of sweet potato fries.  The honey mustard was not that great it had to much zest we asked about that and were told they use a Dijon in it which is why it was that way.  Me on the other hand got ranch with my fries and it was pretty  good.  While we were eating the manager walked by our table and again couldn't be bothered to acknowledge anyone.  It's bad customer service when you act like that.  If it was me I'd definitely be checking in with guests to make sure they are having a good experience.  I don't know if I'm really wanting to give them another go because I felt like I got ripped off honestly.  Almost $30 bucks for a burger, fries and draft on special.  What was sad is they pretty much have the same amount of fries in the side that they gave on the appetizer. I'm a fan of the metal plates though. I think I liked the old Duckworths better.  Please check your female manager she was pretty rude during the whole visit."}
{"text":"Visited last week, they have a huge beer list, like 200 beers, I wish it was a bit colder but with the selection it was still great.  Had a plain old bacon cheeseburger, the menu says it's fresh made to order never frozen and that's just how it tasted, I sit here 10 days since being there and I'm craving that burger. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Yum.  I have been here a few times and have ALWAYS had good service.  Servers seem always be helping each other out.  Severs know the menu quite well. Try to hit it on the off times becuse parking is stressful."}
{"text":"Duckworths park road is always a great time. We often sir at the bar and have great service. There are not many spots offering potato skins, and I love the skins with jalapeño bacon. Alex is a fantastic bartender and quick to offer a beer based on my previous orders. But wait. There's more. Every Tuesday and Thursday most beers are $3.50!"}
{"text":"Good food and great beer selection! My husband and I go all the time, and we haven't had a meal there that we didn't like. Getting the special is usually a good idea. The beer at Duckworth's though is even better than the food. It's the best place in Charlotte for craft beer IMO."}
{"text":"Came here once for a day lunch on a Saturday. They let you bring your dogs and we sat outside - I had a beer and the buffalo chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries - slightly above average but the sitting outside was the best part. 

Went back a week later for the evening drinking festivities and the inside beer selection was great, stayed for two drinks and bolted down Montford..."}
{"text":"Duckworth's is one of my favorite places to go for lunch and/or dinner when I want good, american fare. I've been dining here ever since I moved to Charlotte, and at one point considered myself a regular.

First, they have an extensive beer selection, most of which are on tap. They also have a beer club you can join and earn points towards prizes. My favorite is actually their strawberry whit blend. So fruity and refreshing! Their food is delicious and they have everything from burgers to salads, ribs to fajitas, tacos to desserts. They also have a kick-ass philly cheesesteak, and being from Philly, I'm allowed to say that lol 

They have a large indoor seating area, bar seating and cute outdoor patio seating. The service is typically good, you may have a fluke every once in a while. If you're looking for good, filling fare, this is your place. It's also really close to other restaurants and bars in Montford."}
{"text":"I enjoyed eating there today and seeing how it was renovated. The food and drinks were scrumptious. Ken, a manager, and Brett, a server, were helpful."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection and the nachos are the best! Tues/Thurs $3.50 draft beers are a great deal!"}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection and a great place to watch Sunday ticket. However eat before you leave the house, even for bar food it was pretty bad. If I could I'd give it 5 stars for pretty much the best on tap beer selection in Charlotte and 2 stars for the food"}
{"text":"Went  to the soft opening of Duckworth's. i made a new restaurant since they changed their name, location and updated the menu. So, maybe this should be linked to Duckworth's Cheesesteakery. 

i was a big fan of the Cheesesteakery, but while  their old location was in a good spot the inside was extremely limited.  Now the inside is much more open, inviting and improved. They've also revamped the menu from what i can tell adding fancier steaks and such (don't remember seeing them before), but holding over the good stuff.  

We had some fried mushrooms which were okay. Nothing special, just something fried.  The jalapeno chicken was extremely delicious. Regular price is $14.99 but i think it was worth the price. The wife thoroughly enjoyed it. i can't resist ordering the buffalo Philly cheesesteak. i've never been to Philly, so maybe my taste buds don't know the 'real' thing. But i thoroughly enjoy it with their sweet potato fries.  Delicious.

They were my favorite place to get good draft beer before, and now they increased from 20 to like 60 beers on draft! It is a beautiful thing. With $2.50 specials on ALL beer on Tuesday and Thursday, i don't know of a better place in the area. Every day there is supposed to be select $2.50 drafts. 

The only drawback appeared to be the parking situation which is somewhat limited."}
{"text":"Great place! Ive been here a couple times after work (which is very convenient since i get off late and nothing else is open in the area after 11) they have great service with full knowledge and great suggestions about the beer on tap. Always have a good experience coming and and leaving satisfied. 

At this location they have draft specials on tues and thursday which is awesome! Ive had the pizza which was great all the way down to he crust! Loaded tater tots with bacon cheese and sour cream (yum) and the chicken fajitas! The food is a bit pricey but you get a large portion. Did i mention there are pizza specials on tuesdays?! Another gem that i would become a regular at! 

Great place awesome food and nice people!"}
{"text":"We love this spot to watch sports on the many tvs or to meet up with friends for a late lunch or dinner.
This is also a good choice for groups because the menu is really extensive and offers something for everyone. We enjoy the pizza, the herb crust is amazing, and perfect with some ranch on the side. I also enjoy their salads and sandwiches. I think this is also a good place to have a few beers and appetizers, especially cheese and bacon fries!"}
{"text":"Amazing selection of beers and delicious chicken wings. Very lively atmosphere and am sure everyone would love the staff, they are very sweet, friendly and helpful. Thanks Alex you were really wonderful. I am hooked forever."}
{"text":"Food was good- very generous with their fresh mozzarella on the caprese sandwich. However, server forgot my drink until the food arrived and I didn't see her to ask. My father is 80 and wanted to watch a specific game without having to turn his head. We politely asked if we could have the channel changed, but the server came back and said \"my manager said we aren't changing channels today\". What kind of customer service is that?"}
{"text":"Duckworth's is a great place to go and grab a unique craft beer and some good bar food with friends or colleagues after work. It is also a good place to catch a game, or watch America's recent obsession, the World Cup. 

The food here is much better than I expected. According to the menu, the owners of the place started Duckworth's to bring the taste of Philly down south and put their own spin on the Philly Cheese Steak. With this in mind, I ordered the Steak and Egg Philly. Now I'm not claiming to be a Philly Cheese Steak expert, because I'm far from it, but this thing was impressive. It came with grilled onions, egg, steak, and your choice of cheese. I chose Pepper Jack  of course. The steak was tender and very moist and the combination of the egg and melted cheese gave it a great texture and taste. I definitely would recommend trying it out. 

The cheese steaks aren't the only upside to this place. I've also had their wraps, which are above average for bar food. And I've heard great things about their pizzas, although I've never had it personally. 

The place has a good atmosphere that is geared toward the craft beer nerds (I embrace this title). There were tap handles lining the ceilings, a display of different craft beer bottles behind a plexi-glass window, and a map of the U.S. with the corresponding beer labels in each state. There is also a nice patio that is great for a summer's night. 

The best thing about this place is the beer. They have a rotating tap of all of the craft beers you could want. They normally have some locals (NoDa Brewing, Olde Hickory, Bird Song etc..), but they also have some favorites from around the country (Bell's, Stone, Founder's, etc...). The best way to test the waters and take advantage of the great beer selection is to get the Sampler, which is only $6. They also have a beer club where you can rack up prizes for trying all of their different beers. I'm a sucker for these Beer Club Membership rewards, and will probably end up going here 3-4 times a week. 

This is a great local option for a good craft beer, good bar food, and a good atmosphere. I will definitely continue to go and would recommend stopping in for at least a pint."}
{"text":"Favorite bar grill place to drink some beer and watch the games. Amazing food and great service. Just such a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had a Philly Cheesesteak and it was great.  But even better the service was awesome.   Great selection of beers although a little early in the day for me to drink.  I can recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great beer selection.  Wings are on point.  It's a little dark since they renovated- not great if you are looking to hang out for lunch or daytime drinking, unless you snag a spot on their patio."}
{"text":"First thing that came to my mind... Long bar - long row of draft beers - yes. I came here to try out some of their beers and eat their food. I asked the bartender to give me the sampler with the highest ABV content that they had... And lets say they hooked me up.

A few stouts in, I decided to order their original Philly steak. Instead of provolone cheese though, I instead got mozzarella on it. Just because I just love that stringy cheese on it! (My friend got the white American, but we all know my cheese was more stringy)

Fries was a little bit too salty for my taste, even though they were restaurant made and cut. That isn't bad, but still a little salty. Service was great, the bartender helped me and explained all the beers and described how they tasted which helped me decide which one was the best. I had the Avery stout which was a fruity type of stout that I thought was the best. (Don't go for my word on it though, my bartender left telling me that and I'm not too sure off that info is correct) 

If I lived close by here though, I would probably come here for a beer a day. Overall, I definitely will come back here just to drink. Nice vibe, good amount of tv's for your sports junkies, and beeeeerrrrr. I definitely recommend to come by and check this place out."}
{"text":"great cocktails (cosmo martini) . great prices. ordered full rack ribs. loved it! wings are good too. everything we ordered as a group was not a disappointment . 
loranzo was our server and was excellent except for the fact he had TOO many tables by himself in the middle of the night but had a positive and fun attitude all night. 

will have to say one of the best tasting margaritas i had. will def come back 

."}
{"text":"Nice to have 58 draft beers to choose from.  Try the philly and sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Love this place. The new re-model looks great. Food is always spot on and service is great."}
{"text":"The food? Good. The servers? Fantastic. I can't imagine any server being more attentive. This is a top notch establishment. I have had crappy days, and the servers have made it better. I especially love the Caprese sandwich, if you must ask. The servers all seem to have good suggestions. Except the bratwurst hamburger; steer clear of that unless you're a fan. The chefs are good people. Just ask around."}
{"text":"Great selection of solid crafts on tap.  Not the crap you find everywhere else, the good stuff.  a healthy selection of local and regionals too.  Can be a bit crowded, but service was some of the best I've had that type of environment before, including NYC.  Bartenders were always moving around and not afraid to ask if you were ready for another one.  So many times, in busy places like that, you tend to get forgotten about and passed over by louder people or people flailing their arms everywhere.  I'm quiet and I don't flail my arms, but I got plenty of prompt attention.  Do not miss if you are a craft nerd."}
{"text":"The parking was ok but the food was well worth it. My whole crew had pizza but it was so good. Our server was great and took good care of us. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"The 4 star rating is based on previous visits to Duckworths.  This place has the best cheesesteaks in Charlotte hands down!  There's also a ton of other stuff on their menu so if you can find something you like here then you've got your own issues.  Also a great beer selection.

However, my most recent visit I left, not disappointed, but more so frustrated by the service. Food was excellent per usual, but my server was dumb as a box of rocks.  I ordered a cheesesteak and CLEARLY stated that I wanted no tomatoes.  She proceeded to take the other orders from our table, and then confirmed with me before leaving that I wanted NO tomatoes again.  \"Yes\", I replied.  Then, she walks over to the computer to put in the order, and she yells over to me and asks if I wanted tomatoes on my sandwich...?  A bit baffled, I respond \"NO\".  Meanwhile, I had asked her to change the channel for one of the TV's and she said she would.  That didn't happen as we waited 25+ minutes for three cheesesteaks in a basically empty restaurant.  And then the food comes out and guess what...?  My cheestesteak has 4 ripe and juicy tomatoes sitting right on top.  And she messed up the sides for my friends sandwiches.  Picked em off and the sandwich was great!

Not hating on the place, but this girl needs to tighten up her service.  Still a fan and will be back!"}
{"text":"I don't know about the food, but this place is all about the beer. A lot of rare stuff that I was very surprised to see on tap. This place puts Flying Saucer to shame as far as selection goes. I'd venture to say it rivals Mellow Mushroom in Asheville and Tyler's in Durham. The beer prices are EXTREMELY reasonable for such hard-to-find/eclectic selection. The sampler is a great deal (any 4 beers your heart desires for $4.50)

The new place is MUCH better than the old location when it comes to the 60 or so taps vs. the only 12 or 15 they used to have. Cool atmosphere, big bar(s) and plenty of seating. High ceilings, low lights, ESPN. I'll miss the intimacy of the old location, where we got preferential treatment on those slow nights and often got to dink around with the late-night staff. But what you sacrifice in intimacy, is more than made up for in quality AND quantity of the beer selection. A MUST when visiting Charlotte."}
{"text":"The service is fantastic! I met a group of my former coworkers for dinner and the waiter was very attentive and efficient. We ordered different appetizers to split and it was so good! I have never eaten anything at Duckworth's that I haven't liked!"}
{"text":"If you gave this place five stars I'm going to kick you in the nuts. Yup Yup Yup Yuppies and wannabe hard ass types coexist inside of this place. This place goes against all the laws of nature and is a complete douchefest. If it weren't for the 60 or so drafts at 2.50 a piece I would have to take a dump on this place. Will I be back? Maybe. In all honesty the wait staff was pretty nice if not bothersome. I'm probably being too harsh. Sorry Duckworth's, I apologize and will probably come back and maybe refer some moderate friends or jerks."}
{"text":"Updated interior and menu makes this location better than before, but the location still makes this place a distant second to Brawley's across the street for a spot to grab a beer in good weather. 

I'm a big fan of smoked wings, so their house specialty Moommo's variety really hits the spot with some good sauce. I just was surprised to not have any ranch or celery to accompany the small tray, but I guess they really are going for a cleaner more minimalist approach or simply forgot. 

Made to order salads are a nice option, but not sure they will steal too much business from Chopt over in Park Road Shopping Center. 

The flaw here is simply the location: limited parking and a relatively small patio off to the side just do any make this a destination, but rather a good standby. 

I was also surprised that a juicy, local NE-style IPA was served in a pilsner glass, rather than a tulip or other glass to better highlight the aroma. 

I am very glad Duckworth's has a strong presence around Charlotte and cheers to their tablets to make selecting a beverage more fun with visual assistance."}
{"text":"Great beer selection.  Not your ordinary bar food.  Everything tasted scratch made.   Pork BBQ, gold wings, homemade chips all great.  Hubby loved his applewood bacon cheeseburger.   I  rarely eat coleslaw because I hate mayo - this slaw was fresh, cabbage crunchy, celery seed, just right amount of vinegar-based dressing.  The server, Mary, was fantastic.  She was very patient with my hubby's requests for samples.   Visiting from out of state.  If this was where we lived, we would be here all the time.  If we ever make it back to Charlotte, we will definitely return."}
{"text":"This establishment is close to the park road shopping center. It is in a really good location. The atmosphere is very sports bar / modern tap house feel. The managers are super nice and really want to make sure everything is ok. Shout out to the management staff. The food is incredible. The portions are what Americans should be using for portion sizing. The food is fresh to order and super delicious. I got the chicken tenders and my boyfriend got a chicken sandwich. Both were phenomenal. As you see pictured, the doughnut holes. Wow!!! Talk about incredible. Crispy on the out and airy in the middle. So amazing. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great execution on the neighborhood sports bar with huge beer selection, family atmosphere, and great food. My favorite is the Chicken Philly Cheesesteak. Try it with their delicious fries or go for the side salad!"}
{"text":"My review of this place is super late considering the fella and I come here at least once or twice a month.

Unlike some other places, DWs puts as much emphasis on quality as quantity. The 60 taps are always thoughtful, sometimes rare, and obviously plentiful. The bartenders are incredibly knowledgeable, and they take their beer seriously, but they aren't snooty about it. The fella is a beer nerd, and I'm a total novice, and we both love it. Even the food is surprisingly delicious for \"bar food.\"

We typically go during the day on a Saturday, so neither the parking lot nor the inside is very crowded, but this is always our go-to when we're looking for a comfy, casual place to drink. There are a bazillion TVs in the bar and the restaurant, and they have free wi-fi, so it's a great place to watch a game or just hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and a little bit of everything on the menu to satisfy anyone in your group. Staff is knowledgable about the beer they serve and very polite and courteous and quick."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Waiter Ryan was amazing. Very helpful in beer/food selection. Fast service, good food and great beer selection. Will definitely be back very soon! So happy it's in the neighborhood:-)"}
{"text":"My husband and I dined at Duckworths downtown.  I had the grilled salmon and it was excellent.  The atmosphere was very good.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Disappointed to arrive to a closed restaurant. They are currently remodeling.i did not see anything to indicate when they'll reopen."}
{"text":"They have the best draft beer selection in the neighborhood! And Tuesdays and Thursdays are $3.50 pint nights. If you're a single gal, it's very man heavy those nights ;) The food can be hit or miss sometimes. But they have the best fried pickles in town and I do like the Smokehouse Philly. Overall, it's a good place to hang for beers."}
{"text":"Great beer, great cocktails, great service at the bar, and probably the best wings you will ever eat.  The rest of the food, however, for me is just ok. Go for the wings.  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Highly impressed with the service and food this New Year's Eve night.  The restaurant was pretty full when we arrived around 8pm, but since we informed them we were there just for dinner and not the 10pm party, we were seated immediately at a table that would be moved eventually for the dance floor area.  We had very attentive and cheerful service from Kendra, our drinks were quickly refilled when needed, and the food was delicious as always.  Whenever I crave chicken fajitas, this is my go-to place.  Our daughter loves the pepperoni and basil pizza, and they have some very tasty, lightly breaded, fried pickles.  Nice way to end the old year and start the new!"}
{"text":"Duckworths open Uptown Charlotte.  Good luck! Sitting there with three gentlemen talking and got cut off they have a corporate beer limit.  We explained we live two blocks away but that was it get out. We are concern about your safety, thanks mom! Nothing like a 20 something telling you how to behave.  Seems they were more interested in not serving us, that is what happens when lawyers own a bar.  
Food, bar fare, can get anywhere in town where I am welcome.  This place is for bankers for HHour they  will love it, after 6:43 the locals will go to where everyone knows there name.  Frat boys and bankers if that is your crowd you will be welcome. If you a neighbor stay away."}
{"text":"They are really known for the outstanding beer selection but their food is good as well! Some things that I recommend are the wings, the cheesesteaks and the brisket tacos."}
{"text":"This place closes at two am every day so you can come almost any waking moment and have their yummy boneless wings in almost any sauce you want!  

parking is annoying because the lot is small and they share it with a couple of other places but keep driving around and youll find something!"}
{"text":"We were looking for Lancasters and ended up here.. which was good bc the food was pretty good! 

I had the philly with onion and mushroom and white american cheese and the homemade chips and it was all delicious. The sandwich had a lot of flavor without being really greasy (as cheesesteaks often are) and the chips were a good mix of crispy and soft that I expect when I'm getting homemade chips. 

Other dishes at the table - chicken club sandwich (reportedly VERY good) and a cheeseburger (reported as Ok, but he ate it all so it couldnt have been too bad!!)

Note: They had the BEST Sweet tea I've had in a few years. Really super delish.
I'd definetely go back here."}
{"text":"Started with pickle chips which were ok. Not great but good. 

For dinner my co-worker had both the bold n gold wings and the hot wings. She said both were good but gave an edge to the hot wings. 

I had the chorizo burger. It was good.   The side salad was a generous portion with cucumbers, tomatoes and cheese and not iceberg lettuce (thumbs up)!  The coleslaw was not doing it for me. One bite and that was it. 

Service was great. Drinks refilled timely. Team effort by the servers to make sure food was brought out promptly. Think we had 4 different servers bring us one thing or another. 

Lots of TVs is you want to catch a game and the menu is huge so very likely to find something you would like. 

Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I've been to two Duckworth's in the area and this one is far superior to the one in Ballantyne. The beer menu is endless and amazing but the real attraction here is the cheesesteak. I've been here probably 6+ times and although I tell myself to order something other than the cheesesteak, I simply can't resist. I've had many cheesesteaks in Philly and this is just as good if not better than many of Philly's own famous spots (I'm looking at you Pat's, Gino's and Tony Luke's). I get it with onions and cheese whiz, quite frankly, if you get it any other way, I'm going to judge you and we probably can't be friends. The fries and onion rings are also always on point."}
{"text":"Although the beer list is MUY overwhelming, they introduced me to FRIED BANANA PEPPERS and I'm hooked! Love it and their salads. Don't order take out on the wknd though. We called in. Got there in 20(tho they said 15) and Still had to wait almost 30 friggin minutes for two salads. No bueno...I'll go back during the day tho just for the Bpepps(I'm pretty sure I'm starting something hip n new with that street  name...jealous???)"}
{"text":"Definitely not my favorite place in town, but it's not terrible, either.  The Baja Fish Tacos I had were very good, though the salsa was too sweet and not at all spicy for my taste.

It's definitely a locals only kind of place.  I didn't get the best service at the bar, probably because the bartenders were clearly catering to the regulars who come in all the time.  I asked to have a TV changed to a Hurricanes game, and the manager had to approve it.  When the regular next to me wanted to see a Dallas Stars game, they changed it no problem...

I also have a problem with a place that charges extra for seasonal beers. $6 for a 16oz pour of a seasonal beer from Asheville, NC is excessive when I know for a fact Highland charges the same for it as they do all of their beers.  It's price gouging at its finest.  At the same time, I was crazy enough to pay it cause the beer is that good.

Oh well.  I might go back, might not."}
{"text":"Awesome food. the Garlic fries were amazing as well as a special philly for the week with fontana cheese on it. Cant wait to come back and try some of their HUGE beer selection!"}
{"text":"The food here is not good. Last time I went, I had the veggie fajitas. They were swimming in oil and seasoned like the chef was having a seizure when he made it. The refried beans looked like they had just been scooped out of a can. Pretty sure the sick feeling I had in the pit of my stomach was because of this dish. Other entrees I've had here were not great either. 

Duckworth's redeeming factors are their large selection of beer and convenient location along Park Rd. Also, their bloody marys are right on. 

To summarize, come here for drinks, eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ho-hum.

It is a great spot to go to when other places around me are closed or too far away to drive to when I am hungry. This establishment is convenient that they close a lot later.

Venue - your typical bar-sy place. Yet I would say its cleaner and cool. Definitely not dirty, otherwise, I wouldn't come back here again. 

Food - I like their ribs/wings combo you can order. The ribs are good, little on the dry side, but still edible. The wings are alright, but very greasy (aren't wings greasy anyways?). I had an opportunity to order mushroom burger, on other day that I came here. It was decent. *shrugs*

Drinks - they have my favorite wine-Belgian beer, Linderman's Framboise! 

I would be back for an outing at the bar area, with friends."}
{"text":"Great variety, great food!

We came in from out of town, and we really like going to different, local restaurants. My wife had the Pesto Chicken Sandwich, I had the Steak & Egg Philly, the kids had wings, pizza & a cheese burger and my parents had the classic Philly and the Shrimp Tacos. 

Everything was very good, our waiter was friendly & attentive, and we even stuck around for dessert. 
We loved getting to sit outside on the patio in the shade and just enjoy the evening. 

If we lived here, we'd be back! 
If we come through again, we'll make a point of it!"}
{"text":"Just tried the new Duckworth's off of Park Road.  New menu provides excellent burgers, scrumptious new \"build your own salads\" and tasty flatbreads!  Still has the great selection of craft beers and drinks!"}
{"text":"Unreal beer selection!  The food is fine - I had the wings which were meaty and hot.  I also got the mozzarella sticks - who can screw those up?  Prices are reasonable and they had Hopslam - YUM - for $6 bucks a bottle Monday night.  Awesome!!  They said they have a good inventory of it so we will definitely be back when we run out!

The atmosphere of this place is pretty relaxed.  Plenty of large screen tvs for watching the games.  The booths are really comfy and looks out on busy Park Road.  

The service was friendly and fine.  This past Monday it seemed like a family place but probably for sports games it fills up.  I will definitely be back if I am in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, and great specials. $3 drafts on Tuesdays and Thursdays!!

The food is slightly above average bar food. Try out the cheesesteak, it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointed. Got delivery from postmates. Had multiple missing items and everything I got was absolutely disgraceful or wrong. Got a half BBQ chicken and received one chicken breast got a side Cesar salad and got honey mustard dressing. Well who eats honey mustard on a Cesar salad? I dint ask for that!!! Ordered two cheesecake and only received one. And the one that I got tastes like it's been in the fridge for over a month. Very unprofessional. Will never order from this place again nor recommend it!!! Oh and I have the pics attached for the people that don't believe. Did I mention the salad was half rotted. Y'all trying to kill me?!!!! I'm very angry and don't know if I should go off on duckworths or postmates. Might as well have packed me a bag of dookie. After working a 12 hour long day and you decide to treat your to a lavish dinner, and you get this? It's like I'm on a prank show to see how mad people can make me."}
{"text":"My group of 4 ended up at Duckworth's as a last choice (the restaurant we wanted to go to had a two-hour wait). I reluctantly agreed to \"bar-food,\" but was delighted when I realized what a gem this place is! We sat on the patio and enjoyed people watching the early-Montford crowd.

The menu is big with lots of appealing choices for diners. My boyfriend and I split a cheesesteak (recommended by the people eating with us) and a side salad. He also got some Sweet Heat wings which he said were very tasty -- although he would have liked a smaller option than the 10 wings. The side salad was big and tasty. I expected a nasty, small garden salad (you know what I'm talking about), but this was pretty good! The cheesesteak was delicious; we opted for the \"Steak and Egg\" and, while we had hoped the egg would be fried on top of the steak when it was actually scrambled in with the meat (?), I definitely didn't mind the extra protein. As a Northerner, I'd happily go back here when I need my grease-fix. The boardwalk fries were nothing to rave about, but we didn't mind since we were so full from the sandwich anyway. 

Thanks, Duckworth's!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I go here on Tuesday and Thursdays for their lint night, they have an awesome selection of beer on tap"}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and this place by far has been our favorite spot to go for lunch or dinner, so many choices the kids love it and my husband and i go for a beer and appetizer on Saturdays. Prices are very reasonable. The service is outstanding we absolutely love it."}
{"text":"The food is great but the menu selection could be better. Great drink selection & an awesome location on Montfort. It's in walking distance to lots of great bars. The service is great; servers are very attentive. (Downfall; they took off mozzarella sticks off the menu.)"}
{"text":"Lots of beer options, lots of food options from , Mexican, Italian, American.  Waitstaff great knowledgeable and friendly

Fajita salad awesome ask for their salsa to add to the meal.  Buffalo Chicken philly mild and could of used more filling in sandwich.

Dessert Strawberry shortcake cheesecake amazing. 

I gave a 4 because of cleanliness and the philly, bathroom corners were pretty nasty occasionally someone needs to scrub them also where kegs were stored needs an occasional vacuum walking by them the floor could use some care"}
{"text":"If you love beer this is your place. So many taps I did not even bother counting them all. So many of the beers I never heard of but not hey let you sample as many as you want. The bartenders help steer you to the right beer for you. Now the food. We had some wings which were better than most other plac s we have had wings at lately. We also had a hamburger which was jade out of good beef but it was just a regular burger. Helpful and friendly staff. An overall good place to go from time to time."}
{"text":"Stopped in today to watch the Jets/Pats game.  Asked the hostess if it would be on one of the FIVE tv's at the bar and she said NO even though there was no one sitting at the bar!  Couldn't believe she wouldn't accommodate us? Asked again and she said no, so went directly to the Bartender to see if he would put it on and he was in a fog and didn't seem to know what we were asking him to do.  We told the hostess we were leaving because of the game status (remember no one at the bar) and she had one last chance to solve the problem but she let us walk out...walked down to Braswell's and sat at the bar and asked where the Jets/Pats game would be shown and she said \"wherever you would like it\". Well done Braswell's well done!!!"}
{"text":"I like the new concept they've implemented. I found that the previous menu was too much. Too many options for me to sift through. I like the consolidated menu and the beverages listed on the iPad. The new decor looks great. Taylor was our waitress this past weekend and she was a real gem. Knowledgeable and so friendly. Made sure she checked on us."}
{"text":"Food is certainly not why I would roll in here.  That being said it's a great place to grab a cold one.  They have I think 60 selections of beer and most importantly the staff seems well versed in the types of beer, etc.  That's a plus for an inquisitive guy like me.  

I had the cobb salad and it was just fine.  Topped with grilled chicken and dressed in a vinegarette dressing to finish it off.  

My favorite part (I think I noted this in my review of the other Duckworths) is the $3.00 nightly drafts.  It's not just the crappy beer included in that!  I had a fantastic IMP IPA while I was there.  

This location, while furnished with comfy booths, etc. still isn't the size of the one over in Ballantyne.  It's probably half the size or smaller I think."}
{"text":"Holy cow why haven't I come here more often!!!! 
It's been years since I sat down in this place. Today they killed it with the chicken cheese steak hoagie. As good as Philly or jersey. I was shocked!
Shredded chicken with American cheese on a really good roll with lettuce and tomato (hold the onions) 
I mean sounds pretty simple right? Well people screw it up allllll the time (especially in the south) 
Not here! I'll be back in a few days for another one!  Goodness gracious it was soo yummy. 

The service was good. There are tvs everywhere, they have A LOT of beer on tap, a big menu to accommodate your whole crew(even the picky ones), a patio and its conveniently located right on park road at the corner of Montford. 

I also like that they are open In between lunch and dinner, as often as I'd love to eat at 12, work or life pulls you in other directions so this is good place to come.... I mean today we had lunch at 4 lol and they accommodated and had a nice little crowd in there catching up on Indy and Coca Cola 600 news! Ya know what?
I might just become a regular 
This place is great!"}
{"text":"Been reading about duckworths forever. We finally stopped in for lunch. The waiter Darrius was great. He recommended a Philly steak which he said was his favorite. It was great. My wife had a steak salad which she loved. 
The beer list was almost too large. I felt like I was taking the SAT exam flipping through pages trying to find a beer. I settled on a flight which was well priced and the beers were great. 
Tons of TVs if you are into that. Overall, the food and drink were really great! Will definitely go back if we are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Went on corporate lunch with a group of 8 people. Fast and enthusiastic server. However, they got my order wrong. Ordered cheddar cheese on burger but they put American cheese. Instead of creating new burger with correct cheese, they took the burger back and melted an additional cheddar cheese slice on top of the American cheese slice with the top of my burger bun now soggy from them potentially zapping the burger in the microwave. So, therefore, burger not impressive. The only thing I liked was the bacon they put on the burger which was quality stuff. I would not order this again."}
{"text":"First visit since remodel. Sat outside, so can't comment on inside, but.... They took pizza  and Asian salad off the menu!!. My two go tos for dinners. Beer is now on a tablet.  List was much easier to use.  May not go quite as often.  Service and food was good, but limited menu now missing favorites."}
{"text":"In town for a visit and what a great discovery!! The beer selection could be the best I've ever seen and blows away any place in NYC i can think of including the Ginergerman, DBA , blind tiger. 
Different atmosphere than any of the NYC places and is more of a local sports bar , but man what a selection of fresh tap beers, bottle beers served by an extremely knowledgeable bartenders. Great wings, good pizza . Thankfully I don't live near this place or I'd be divorced."}
{"text":"I have GOT to update my original review. Went here in a Saturday night and there were tumbleweeds in this joint. Unfortunately, we soon discovered why! The server was slow. The bathroom was gross. The food is decent. I ordered the italian sub. It was aight. Just okay I say. But to their credit I wasnt expecting Thomas Keller level at a sports bar. They had a beer special i ordered that came out in a child's size cup. All petty things aside what really would have made my meal more enjoyable would have been better service. And a better atmosphere. Back in the day you could barely get a seat at the bar. I don't know what happened to this place! Duckworths South Park you had soooo much potential. Please go to rehab and come back to me when your clean."}
{"text":"Food was okay... service not the best...fruit fly in my drink... I prefer the one in huntersville. Everything is much better at that one."}
{"text":"This place is a great place to hang out with friends and catch up. 

We go every Tuesday for $3.50 draft night and we love that we get to try new craft beers for a reasonable price. The garlic fries are the best to munch on with your beer and the friendly staff will make you feel comfortable.

The wait can be a bit much, but if you're there with friends for beer, it's really great."}
{"text":"This place has great food, and great beer. 

Let's get the important stuff out of the way: beer.  Duckworth's has one of the more impressive draft beer selections in Charlotte.  I would say top 3 in Charlotte.  They have a lot of great and random beers.  The hard part is picking WHICH beer you want.  

Food:  I wanted to tell you that the food across the board is great.  However, in writing this and being honest - I have only had 1 thing.  That one thing was the Chicken Philly Supreme, and it's awesome.  Get the Boardwalk fries - They are great!  

I'm a quasi-regular here.  The food and beer are great.  Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The service and food were fine. I enjoyed my Philly Cheesesteak and garlic fries. I also really enjoyed the zucchini fries we had as an appetizer. Everyone else enjoyed their food as well, for the most part. MY one complaint is they seated the five of us at a table that really should have been a four top. There was another table right behind us in the same situation. While the rest of the area was empty, we were placed right on top of one another. They could have easily pulled two tables together and given us more room. Even as the place got busier, there were many tables left empty. AS I mentioned, the service was quite friendly and on top of refills, etc. The food was tasty and hot. This is not something that will keep me from coming back again, but (admittedly, I have a larger than average personal air space) it does factor into my enjoyment overall when I am having trouble banging knees with others, overlapping utensils, and finding a place for all the plates."}
{"text":"What an incredibly poor place to go for a Friday lunch.

We cancelled the 1 Philly Cheesesteak order after an hour's wait with no updates....

Manager's response: \"OK\"...Sheesh.  

The shame is I've been up to now a big fan of the food and the service....

Sorry guys but a big fail today."}
{"text":"To have Cheesesteaks in the name...they miss having a great cheesesteak by a mile. I would love to find a good cheesesteak in Charlotte but this isnt the place. Plus its way over priced for the product you get."}
{"text":"We ordered the sweet and bold gold wings with two Belgian beers ! The pizza was made to order with green peppers , onions and fresh basil.  All in all the food is really good and they have a wide selection on beers on tap ! We did 6 Jäger shots which were a special that day. Will come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Great service. Awesome place to come and watch some football. Waitress was great and helped me select a beer that I wouldn't have chosen otherwise. One of my favorite spots in Charlotte."}
{"text":"You'll find me here on a weekly basis. 36+ beers on tap that are rotated frequently. There is always something new to try. If a game is on TV, they'll have a TV for you to watch it on.The food is great for pub food. They have daily specials that the chef creates. If you have a chance to try the Blue cheese & spinach stuffed portabella mushroom take it! Definitely try the buffalo blue cheese chips or as I prefer buffalo blue cheese french fries."}
{"text":"Great bar food and the BEST sweet potato fries that I've had in Charlotte. Easy going atmosphere and the kiddos ate for free because it was Wednesday."}
{"text":"Our server was Chrystal and she was amazing very energetic and charismatic! A true gem! The food was delightful and delicious. Keep up the good work and we will for sure be back!!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Good food and service...was able to watch all the Sunday football games including my team."}
{"text":"Seated quickly and then sat unattended for over 15 minutes without anyone even taking a drink order.  Can't review the beverages or food, we left."}
{"text":"Delicious Delicious Delicious!!! The fajitas are delivered on a wooden skillet sizzling straight from the grill!!! The chicken was spicy and moist, good enough to be eaten alone. It's a large amount of chicken, much more than the average restaurant.  It comes with 4 tortillas and a moderate amount of fillings (lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, beans, guacamole.) Friendly staff, manager and clean bathrooms!  Thanks Crystal for great service!"}
{"text":"Nice looking place tons of TV's there is not a blind place to be found. Excellent beer list with tons of drafts and bottles. I tested them by getting a bottle to see if they brought a glass. All beer should be poured you don't drink wine right from the box!! Not only did I get a glass but they poured it too!  The food menu is very respectable with the normal bar food. Today I got the ribeye and it was delicious. We have been here many times and will continue to come."}
{"text":"Duckworths at Ballantyne was my top favorite restaurant.  Moved down the list to third. Great wings, fajitas, BBQ, and awesome Philly Cheesesteak. This is until they decided to expand.  We go out of our way because the closest restaurant to us is 30 minutes away. The last two visits were terrible. There is a difference between charred and burnt and cooks need to know this.  At the Uptown location our wings literally were burnt and had terrible burnt taste. My husbands fajitas were burnt also.  The onions were totally black and the \"charred\" chicken taste so burnt it was inedible.  Too expensive of a meal for this.  Waitresses should refuse to deliver food to the table. We don't like to complain or return food but it has really become necessary when our food is being delivered so burnt it is all you taste and miss the great grilled flavor.   Our last visit was the Park Road location and our wings were burnt again. So black and charred all you could taste was burnt flavor.  My husband ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and the burnt taste overpowered the great grill flavor. We again hate to complain but decided to just let our server know because we hate to see our favorite restaurant start falling in the ranks.  Sad, but expansion tends to do that to a good restaurant.  \"Tool many cooks in the kitchen spoil a good meal\" might just be the phrase for the fast growing chain. We didn't get them to recook anything or expect any compensations, just want Duckworths to stay on top and get chefs to get some training from Ballantyne location. Note: There is a fine line between charred and burnt and too many times you are crossing that line."}
{"text":"Great experience and the food is really good. There has been lots of changes over the past year. The menu is much better (condensed)and the prices are great. It was a very clean restaurant and the  service is great. Manager came up to check on us and the food came out really quick. Get the steak and cheese, you won't regret it! 

Samer"}
{"text":"I really WANT to give Duckworth's a higher rating, but they fucked themselves on this one.

The good: 
The fish tacos were \"okay.\" Grilled fish, decent flavor profile. Tortillas, meh. Not very good. But I'm a tortilla snob. If you're going to offer em, make em fresh.
The Philly Cheesesteak was unbelievable. Best cheesesteak I've had since the last time I was in Philly. Awesome.

The bad:
The service fucking sucks. Let me be clear: it doesn't just suck, it FUCKING SUCKS. It was slow, lazy and they got an order completely wrong. 

The meal came out slowly, which was not that horrible, but noticeable. Still, I thought the restaurant deserved a solid four stars. But as the meal was ending, my dining companion ordered potato skins to-go to bring to his wife. As she was pregnant and had an aversion to certain foods, he very clearly and explicitly ordered the potato skins without onions or bacon.

Well, I'll bet you can guess what kind of merry-go-fucking-fuck-coaster came next, right? It took a half an hour after we were done eating (and twenty minutes after we'd paid for the damn things) for the potato skins to come out. And when they did, guess fucking what? Onions and bacon up on that bitch. Needless to say, my friend and I were livid. 

We got the manager and his saving grace (and the only reason why this restaurant gets two stars) is he quickly fixed it. Skins were back out sans onions and bacon and  the amount we paid for them was quickly refunded. Good to know there's one competent person in this restaurant.

I guess maybe some day I can be convinced to go back, but those idiot fucking servers had better tremble if they see my face in that restaurant again. Because if they fuck up, I will come down on that restaurant like the Hammer of Thor.

(With apologies to It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.)"}
{"text":"The server is good but they are out of several beers that I want. Perhaps they could work with the distributers or something and anticipate the need to have a better supply. I will also say the food is good but that is far overshadowed by them running out beer I want."}
{"text":"Cant recommend the buffalo chicken or bacon chicken wraps my wife and I just ate. The buffalo has very little heat and is no where close to the traditional flavor you expect. The Bacon chicken wrap was bland. The banana pepper appetizer was on point though - good stuff."}
{"text":"Been to duckworths a few times for dinner and for drinks with friends. It's a pretty straight forward restaurant bar. Tvs all around. Good selection of beers. Nice food selections. 

One of the best things about duckworths (IMHO) is that it's open late. It's tough to find a casual spot open late in or near South Park. This is one of our go-to spots when it's late. I also like taco Mac during times like this, but some people find it too big and overwhelming with all of the TVs, countless beer options and so on. Duckworths has the feel of a more intimate sports bar. I like it.

I can't type another word without talking about their food. Specifically their wings. I love their wings! Recently a group of five of us went and split 24 wings and fries and just had a lovely time. I've tried other things (ribs, chicken tenders, salads), but now that I've tried their wings, I'm going to keep coming back for them. They do have daily food and drink specials which are also definitely worth considering. 

Service was quick and friendly and the prices aren't bad at all. I'd recommend it!"}
{"text":"After discovering Duckworth's in January I proudly say I'm a regular!  Even though I don't live in the neighborhood anymore, this is definitely me & my sweetie's go to place for sports, beer & nibbles!

We've enjoyed getting to know our favorite bartenders (Anthony, Corey, Tara) as well as being known by them by name as well!

They are always friendly, helpful and have great selections for us to try as they change their taps over as they know our tastes!

We love the place, the people, the beers, the food and the atmosphere!  We recommend it to others and look forward to visiting many more times during football season and into infinity & beyond!"}
{"text":"I'm baffled by the positive reviews of the food here. I wanted to like this place, on account of the vibe and impressive beer selection, but the food made that truly impossible. We came on a Sunday night and ordered a salad and pulled pork platter. Our appetizers were the fried banana peppers and the caprese salad. The fried banana peppers are just not something you want to eat a whole plate of - after about 5, the spicy, briny flavor and oodles of friedness just get to be overpowering. The caprese salad was drowning in dressing. The entree salad wasn't bad, but not impressive. What really stole the show was the pulled pork entree. The moment it arrived at our table, all we could do was stare. I've never seen pulled pork look wet and gray like that. It's not that hard to make food look edible, so when it looks bad right out of the gate, you know it's probably going to be awful. And awful it was. I've known my boyfriend for over a decade and this is the first time I've ever seen him send a dish back. He apologetically explained to the server that it tasted like it had been microwaved, and the server admitted that this was actually how they prepare it. Microwaving their pulled pork is apparently standard operating procedure in the kitchen. Based on how wet it was, I'm guessing it's microwaved in a plastic bag and dumped onto a plate. I've never heard of a restaurant where microwaving entrees is part of the protocol in the kitchen. The server admitted that some things on the menu had recently changed, and this was one of them. It sounds like management is trying to save on food costs by cutting corners. But this was truly egregious - no restaurateur with any respect for their trade could possibly condone what's going on in the kitchen at Duckworth's.

All I can guess is that things must have been MUCH better once upon a time here, considering the good reviews this place has gotten. Whatever they've changed, they need to change it right back, stat.

(Note: the manager did take off the entree in question from the bill and the staff was generally OK, but even the service/hospitality of Duckworth's didn't really impress)"}
{"text":"Clean, classy, casual, spacious and friendly staff helps complete a good experience here but I am distracted by the many wonderful beers to choose from. Not to mention a wonderful selection of liquors. I haven't even got to the food yet, amazing.

Nachos, burgers and beers really hit the spot for me but also try the grilled chicken, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great \"Gastro Pub\" type eatery! The staff was friendly and very knowledgeable. The food and beer selection was also ample, even had a few California beers on there for me!"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit to a Duckworth's (the other was the Ballantyne location).  Unfortunately both visits were disappointing.  The bar service was friendly and fast at both locations but the food service was slow and the food was poorly prepared at both locations. I ordered their house special wings (mamoo's wings?) at Ballantyne. It took approximately 30 minutes to get them and when they came out they were cold and the sauce had separated into 1/2 spices and 1/2 grease. I tried to eat a couple of the wings but ended up pushing the plate away and decided to skip eating and just finish my beer and leave. At the Southpark location I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap. Again it took 20-30 mins to get my food (several people who came in after me got their food before I did) and there were very few people in the restaurant.  So not sure why the food service was slow. The chicken was completely over-cooked (charred thin pieces dry as leather) and they forgot to put the buffalo sauce on.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once to eat and once for drinks.  They always seem to have some pretty decent drink specials.  

When I was there to eat I had the club with sweet potato fries.  The club and fries with the honey mustard sauce were great and the price was very reasonable.  I will definitely be back to try some of their other eats."}
{"text":"Duckworths was surprisingly great! The service was awesome and our food was hot and delicious! 
I enjoyed it! 
I will recommend and visit again. I hear that the pizza is good too!"}
{"text":"I have found a new love in my life and its name is Van Diest Früli. It is honestly the nectar of the gods. Lambic's can be a bit tart in my opinion, but this fruit infused (Strawberry) juice beer is incredible and perfectly balanced in flavor. My boyfriend and his friend loved it as well (although I am sure they wouldn't like be admitting that)...and his friend even got a double in a pint glass since singles are served in champagne flutes, and god-forbid a man drink his ale from that! Duckworth's is one of the only places I've seen this beer (let me know if anyone knows of another). They have a great selection of beer ranging from $3 on up.

 Our bartenders were attentive and were able to keep up with the crowds from the game. Speaking of football games, holy tv land. There isn't a bad spot in the restaurant to watch the game. We saw people eating and they appeared to have more than just typical bar-food ( a man was eating a steak next to us). 

I'll be back for my Früli fix!"}
{"text":"Hey Duckworth's where's the menu, me and my lady come here for the steak salad but it's not on the menu anymore which sucks. I'm not saying you're gonna lose a customer because we really enjoy the Friday night half priced wine. Philly it's good for the Queen City. Bring back the steak salad."}
{"text":"i wasnt very excited about their move bc i liked the old tucked away spot they had, it was never too crowded in a neighborhood that likes to wear places out (my neighborhood) BUT went there yesterday for the first time since they moved and as usual it was great.  just ordered a normal philly cheese steak (cheese wiz and onions) it was the perfect.  while there i was floored by their draft selection.  as far as the myers park/south charlotte area goes this is my #1 beer joint.  i highly rec this spot, like the new locale and really really impressed by the draft selection.  this place is a must for cheesesteak lovers and especially beer lovers."}
{"text":"This is basically the fox & hound with better food, more TVs and better beer selection/specials. It makes me sad we don't have this place in Tulsa. Great place to watch NFL on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Went here to watch the NCAA tournament games tonight.  We ordered the buffalo chicken nachos and they didn't disappoint.  These were the BEST NACHOS IVE EVER HAD.  The chip to topping ratio was perfect. Duckworths is an upscale bar with plenty of beer selections.  There are tvs everywhere so you will not miss a game!  Definitely recommend. 

Came back and had wings and the spring mix salad, both really amazing!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on Wednesday. The chicken bacon wrap was phenomenal along with the service. Big props to Kyle for his great service."}
{"text":"First time eating at any Duckworth's and I was pleasantly surprised. I've heard good things about their food and service and we weren't disappointed in this visit. Having just come from Brawley's nearby, we didn't take advantage of the $3 Thurs draft specials but there seemed to be a pretty good selection. Next time for sure!

We split the half rack ribs and 5 wings platter (comes with 2 sides) and it hit the spot. The wings were fresh, tasty and average size. The ribs were great, nicely cooked and still good the next day. The platter also came with two sides and some texas toast. Overall well worth the $17 for us. Oh and the service was on par! He made sure to come back often but not too often to check on us. I'd come back on another Thursday when I'm thirsty."}
{"text":"One place I always forget exist in Charlotte..Not in a bad way, somewhere I do enjoy going to without burning the place out by going every weekend like I do some places.

This establishment has a fair amount of TV's with a very open beer selection. That is one thing that I love is the beer. The food is really good to, I enjoy getting the pizza and love their apps. Most people I know would label this place as a \"BAR\" but I look at it different only because they have very good food."}
{"text":"60 beers on tap. Sixty. Six-zero. I'm not even the biggest beer drinker, but hot damn that selection makes me feel like I need one every time I come here.

I will look over the menu and try to force myself to order something else, but I just can''t stray away from the Phillys. They are so ridiculously yummy here. My go to: buffalo chicken Philly... add banana peppers. Sometimes I get it with Cheese Whiz. I know, I know... I'm awful. 

When I do have some self control here, I go with the salmon salad and ask for the fish to be cooked in one of the wing sauces. I like terriyaki-hot. I enjoy going here with a group in hopes that I can steal a wing or piece of pizza from someone. Lay off me, I'm starving.

This location has drink specials every day. Tuesdays and Thursdays all the drafts are $3.50. Gah, is it pumpkin beer season yet?!

One big downfall: the parking situation is awful. That's the problem for this entire Montford area. 

I was bummed to move away from this hood and being just a couple blocks away from here. However, I am super excited about their new location set to open Uptown in the old Fox and Hound. Staff tell me to expect that to open around January."}
{"text":"Hooray beer!

Duckworth's is THE place to go if you are in Myers Park and find yourself with a bit of thirst. They have an impressively large selection on draft (including seasonals and hard-to-find-on-tap beers) and an even more expansive selection in bottles. All styles, flavors, and nationalities are represented.

As others have said, the food is bar food, but decently done for what it is. My go-to are their hot dogs. Toasted buns and franks exploding with juicy goodness. The perfect thing to help wash down your beer.

The staff is friendly and fun, and pretty fast and responsive, given how busy this place is. It's relaxed with no pretenses. It's quiet enough to hold a conversation but not so quiet that you feel dumb for yelling at the idiot ref on TV. If you haven't been yet, you're really missing out."}
{"text":"Fantastic food but service was lacking.     I got the shrimp fontina flatbread and it was great.    Very garlicky but I am a huge garlic fan.     Aside from that the caprese appetizers were also very good and the drink menu is out of this world.      Our server kept forgetting about us but the food made up for it."}
{"text":"My first visit to Duckworth's Grill and Taphouse.... Wow, really good! Ordered the TwistedChicken sandwich for lunch.....Fantastic and great BBQ sauce. Tater tots are best I've ever had as well. waiter, Chris knew his 'stuff' and was prompt and attentive.  Great spot... 
I will return!"}
{"text":"The outside setting is very good, in a Plaza.  Great for warm nights.  The inside seating, not so good. We had the Philly cheese steaks (it's in the name!) and I was disappointed.  Not enough taste, and not enough cheese.  Overall, pretty \"papery\" taste.  In addition, the service was subpar, the beer menu was out of date and the one that I was able to order came out warm and flat."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of duckworths, this location has half priced wine on certain days and are very willing to accommodate parties of all sizes."}
{"text":"OMG. 
I passed by this place many times but tonight was the first time in there. We decided to stop in after a movie at Park Rd Theater. 
I won't spend much thumb - typing time on this. 
The food wasn't horrible, but the place was. It was so f*cking loud with the dozen tvs and everyone yelling to be heard over the other people yelling I thought I would scream (but didn't as I realized no one would notice). 
What a wretched place this is. 
Wretched. Seriously."}
{"text":"I don't remember much about this place except for one of the drink specials they had the night I was there- $5 Patron shots.. Ya I definitely took advantage of that.. 4 stars!"}
{"text":"The updates that Duckworth's have made to their menu have not gone unnoticed! I had the blackened salmon salad and it was hands down one of the best salads I have ever had. The flavor was amazing and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"As far as beer selection goes, It's awesome. Food? it's meh...it's overpriced and not very good. Too bad, I would definitely go more often if their food was worth a sh*t"}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant - food and service are always fantastic and the beer list is phenomenal!!! The location is a great place to start a fun night, there are several other bars within walking distance on Montford Street. The area is low-key, fun and a much better atmosphere than Uptown, especially for people in their mid to late 20's. 

I especially love that they have Fruli on tap, I fell in love with the strawberry beer in London a couple years ago and have not been able to find it anywhere else in town."}
{"text":"Great drink selectiom here with so many beers on tap and various specials. We visited Friday night, 5 of us, and our server was quirky but hilarious. He steered us away from certain dishes he didnt think was great without telling us not to get it. Food turned out great. I got the chorizo burger with a side of coleslaw. The burger was great but coleslaw was a bit bland. Everyone else enjoyed their food. The thing though... it was friday night around 730 and it was completely dead in the restaurant, yet somehow our food took about 30 minutes from time or order to being served. Not sure what was going on."}
{"text":"So...we totally came here because I was starving and I needed somewhere that wasn't fast food, but I could get a meal fast.  I turn into Joan Rivers or Patti LaBell if I don't eat.  Seriously.

We see Duckworth's all the time as we drive past it every other day or so.  It's close to our \"hood\" and it's always busy!  We pulled in, I rolled out and walked in without Hubs...because again, I was starving.  I had planned on ordering  to go order so I could devour it in the privacy of my own home but we ended up staying and we sat at the bar.  The bar tender saw that I was about 2 minutes from passing out and went and hurried my order.  Tadaaaaa burger came out.. FAST! It was just what my stomach ordered!

Place is clean, fun, TONS of tv's for watching your favorite college or NFL or any sport, staff is friendly, service was quick, food was good and I will now like to come back and partake in the great patio that they also have!

Thank you Duckworth's for quickly putting food into my belly! :)"}
{"text":"I come here any time I'm able to when I'm in Charlotte. My hotel is usually close to the bigger chain grill and taphouses - you know, the one that conjures images of big-eyed aliens and the one that sounds like a Mexican restaurant with good Mac-n-Cheese. However, while the Saucer is pretty good, this place, with a few less taps, eats their lunch. The craft beer selection is managed very well, offering quality hard-to-find pours. In one sitting, I had Hopslam, Big Bad Baptist, and La Terrible: rarities on draft in my travels. As for their food, I can only comment on their wings. Why? Because I can't bring myself to have anything else. Perfectly cooked, perfectly sauced, and delicious, with rich blue cheese to accompany them, as any respectable wing should expect. Ranch lovers, step off, and get a damn salad. But I digress. If you love wings, even with ranch (you probably ate ketchup on everything as a kid, didn't you?), Duckworth's is a wing artisan. I look forward to my next trip to the CLT."}
{"text":"Hungry for a Cheesesteak......Perfect place.  Service was excellent, atmosphere is perfect and the food can't be beat.  Tried the Blue Cheese Chips as an appetizer......Delicious. 
Without a doubt, they will get my repeat business."}
{"text":"I love beer so I must admit I was happy with the large selection of beers on tap.  Also, the $3.00 draft special for nearly everything on the draft menu didn't hurt either.  The food was great too!  I had the blue cheese chips - a delicious first for me, onion rings, and the classic Philly cheese steak.

The only downfall was the service.  When I got there I was not greeted.  Although I was waiting for a buddy of mine, I was shocked that none of the five staff screwing around at the greeters stand said hello or welcome.  So, after roughly ten minutes, I went to the bar to wait  and got a beer.  I felt like the bar keep was inconvenienced by my presence.  How dare I order a beer!  The saving grace was my server once my friend arrived and we moved to a table.  Good job sir!  Although you were the best of the worst, I actually think you did a great job.  Your colleges need to take notes."}
{"text":"We went to Duckworth's for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. They had a very wide variety of beer and menu items. Portions were large and reasonably priced. Not super crowded either. A good place to go and watch a game."}
{"text":"Anyone who thinks Duckworth's has a good cheesesteak has never had a real one. They're one of the few places in Charlotte that ship their bread in from Amoroso's - the same place Geno's and Pat's get it from in Philly. And somehow their cheesesteaks still suck.  It's the meat.  It's not good.

I've had several other menu items here because I like the beer selection - nothing is better than average."}
{"text":"I'm writing in response to the recent remodel. It looks great, but the chairs were not chosen for comfort, booths were comfortable.

The food: I didn't recognize anything new on the menu, and only noticed quite a bit missing. I have been twice since the reopening with 2 different people, and we were all disappointed with the menu. I'll explain:

Removed from menu:
Pizza
Wraps
Cobb salad
Lunch specials 

The wraps were a great option for people like myself who try to avoid bread. The lunch specials included a drink which was nice because the prices are high. Unless I hear wraps are available I do not plan to go back. My husband and friend felt the same. Bummer because all were regulars. Also, all the staff is new so we no longer feel the welcome back vibe."}
{"text":"I have driven past this spot numerous times and finally decided to stop in, and am glad I did. First, the amount of beers here is beyond impressive. There's definitely a beer for everyone on their list. We stopped in on a Wednesday night, and they had a pizza deal going on so my friend went with that. They also had another special that included a growler, which I might have to check out next time. I went with their chicken pesto sandwich, and I asked for it without the bun, and the presentation when it came out was quite nice in place of the bun (I was too hungry and forgot to take a picture of it). 

Overall the prices were decent, their portions were very filling and their beer list was long. Duckworth's will be on my list to frequent again."}
{"text":"Poor service for our large group. Very slow.  Double booked an area for a large group.  Food was just ok but over priced"}
{"text":"We have come to Duckworths regularly over the past 4 -5 years.   Unfortunately,  over the past couple of years, culminating with the reopening of the old Fox and Hound location, it has become less and less local, and more and more corporate, with today's episode really proving the point.  So you understand how money hungry they have become, you should know that they now have a policy that they will not mix salad dressing and salad for you.  It's \"Corporate Policy\" when they are too busy  not to toss a salad in the kitchen.  That's what we were told.  Take a look at the trend in reviews for their restaurants and you'll get the hint.  Maybe  they are hoping to be the next Hickory Tavern, but this would never happen there.  It looks like the duckworth brand has become associated with over reaching in pursuit of expansion.  Go somewhere else, you work too hard for the money they aspire to underdeliver for."}
{"text":"GREAT beer & liquor selection here!! Over 60 beers on tap, and probably over 200 bottles to choose from. Servers are usually very friendly, but if they're slammed, don't expect fast service. In my opinion the food is worth the wait. I've tried fried pickles at many different restaurants around Charlotte, but theirs are still my favorite. I also love their pizza. I usually get pepperoni and add fresh basil. My mom always gets the fajitas...and I always have to grab some of the chicken. Such great flavors in those fajitas!!"}
{"text":"Well I finally made it to the new DGT location since my last review and I must say this space is a big improvement and the addition of a nice and large outdoor patio is also great. 

Atmosphere - Spacious, modern-ish, lively, mostly 20 somethings but kids and young parents are here too. 

Food - I had a boring grilled chicken sandwich w/ sweet potato fries. Boring not in taste but b/c it was just a boring order on my part. Oh, I also tried a special appetizer that they had for the day b/c it sounded interesting. It was a peanut butter & jelly flat bread w/ sliced banana and brie cheese. To bad it tasted awful as it was overcooked. 

Service - Friendly, but I would not say attentive as she did not correct the overcooked appetizer.

Overall - The place is still okay and the new location is a nice improvement.  Just be careful when purchasing your appetizers. 

Note: This new location for Duckworth's is just down the street from the old location but the reviews and photos are still the same.  With that being said, some of the older photos on Yelp are not relevant anymore."}
{"text":"You have to come here! Visiting from FL and I wish there was one back home! Came to watch the playoff game and have some wings. Our server Cory was awesome, very attentive and gave us honest suggestions of the menu. We ordered the hot and garlic Parmesan wings (perfectly cooked and crispy)  the Philly  and blue cheese chips. Everything was prompt, hot, had great presentation and Atmosphere was great and packed! We will be back tomorrow night before heading home to FL. Trust me when I say you would be missing out!"}
{"text":"Fun weekend spot. The buffalo blue cheese chips are SO yummy. Everything else we had was relatively good - pizzas, sandwiches, salads. Lots of beer options."}
{"text":"Clearly the first thing I have to say is that the parking leaves much to be desired... But! If you go during the day, it's not nearly as bad... 

Now that we've got that out of the way, this place rocks... I love the beer selection because they've got something for everybody... They have options for fries that are out of this world... The garlic fries were so yummy and the boardwalk ones with the Old Bay and malt vinegar? Omigosssssh. Straight yum.  I've even had a salad that surprised the heck out of me with its goodness... Their Spring Mix with the feta, cranberries and pecans was amazing... And I'm not a huge salad fan...

The service is consistently solid here and they have decent daily specials... Give it a shot! You won't be disappointed... :)"}
{"text":"I love duckworths beer specials and food (especially the nachos) but their service recently is terrible! Today I walked in and the hostess was grabbing menus to seat us. All of the sudden she told us she couldn't seat us because the kitchen was backed up but when we looked around there were plenty of open tables? We were confused and asked if we could sit down to have drinks and she wouldn't communicate with us any further, it was very bizarre. We decided to sit down in the bar area to figure out where we were going to go and she would not stop staring at us! The most uncomfortable situation ever for a patron. Definitely spoiled my overall opinion on duckworths, what a shame!"}
{"text":"Tried the Foothills Sexual Chocolate Stout. Amazing . Paired it with the duck Worth's taphouse with fries sooo good. Anthony served me at the bar very friendly. Also told me about Duckworth's Hop Man Beer Club where you get rewarded for trying beers what's  not to like"}
{"text":"WOooo hoooo!!  Great Burger, plethora of beer choices, and extremely friendly bartenders/staff.  What more are you looking for??  Affordable??  On Tu/Th, every single draft is $2.50.  We walked out of there paying about $30 for two man-sized meals, two quality beers each, and big fat smiles on our faces.  You must try anything with the Jalapeno Bacon.. I am salivating just thinking about it.  You have got to give this place a shot if you are in the area.  Dare I say...... GEM ALERT!!    Enjoy!

(Keep an eye out for updates on the food.  I will be back there soon)

-Ian M."}
{"text":"Tried out the \"upgraded\" duckworth's and I'm not impressed. Awful service on a slow night. I would hate to see the service when it's actually busy."}
{"text":"It looks like a typical sports bar, but the food surpassed typical sports-bar fare. The menu is big. The menu has a lot of variety. I had a hard time choosing what to get. 

We ordered the nachos with chili to split between the four of us. The portion size is obscene. Also obscene was how much of it we ate. Someone joked that Duckworths must put crack in it because we couldn't stop eating it. Addictively good. 

For my entrée I ordered a new menu item: margherita chicken with balsamic reduction (grilled chicken, fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, caramelized onions, basil, and balsamic). The dough was perfectly crisped and I'm glad I veered from my normal red sauce pizza. 

For dessert, we split a pumpkin cake. If I didn't feel sick from the gluttony, I would've eaten the whole thing. It tasted like the best of a carrot cake and apple spice cake. Cream cheese frosting. 

(I can't believe we ate that much.)

Duckworths has a big selection of craft beer and I was happy to order my new favorite: Hop Drop and Roll. 

We are definitely going back. I hope soon. More nachos, please."}
{"text":"Love the beer selection. Great variety and staff will help you choose what you want. Food is great too, definitely more of a variety than most bars. Service can be off some nights but for the most part it is a great place to go for a beer. Half off drafts on Tuesday, half off wine bottles on Fridays."}
{"text":"Kudus to Duckworths; I had a lousy experience , so much so I left a review and the general manager contacted me. That is nice."}
{"text":"Been thinking about the excellent tap beer selection and fantastic sweet potato fries since my last visit to Charlotte 10 months ago. I was finally able to visit again. The staff is efficient and knowledgable about the many beers on tap. The fresh beef burgers are excellent and filling. The environment is fun, if a little loud. All of this, and reasonable prices too!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe I have not made it to Duckworth's before now, but SO happy I gave it a try, and look forward to my next visit.
I arrived shortly after noon on Sunday, craving a Bloody Mary. After being carded, ha ha, I received one of the best drinks I have had in a while. It had a great spice with a hint of heat, which I love, and two olives. Perfect !

Having never been before I asked my waiter for his recommendation out of the sandwiches. He recommended the Chicken Filet sandwich in a wrap. I went with his choice. The wrap arrived, chicken grilled too perfection, and a lot of it, with bacon, shredded lettuce, cheese, mayo and honey mustard.  It hit the spot and although a little messy I would definitely get it again. I chose the tator tots as my side, hot and cooked perfectly, although a little greasy, but every once in while everyone needs a little grease. 
While I enjoyed the games on the multiple TVs I saw some great salads go by, ribs, and smelled the amazing fajitas being served on a sizzling platter. Look forward to checking out more of Duckworth's menu. 
And, one added bonus, I thought the customer service was outstanding. Not only was my waiter attentive and friendly the Manager arrived to make sure everything was okay. And, he continued to visit tables during my entire visit, something you do not see too often these days. Great Job!"}
{"text":"Chris was an amazing server. He was attentive and humorous. We loved everything that we ordered. If we ever come back to Charlotte we will be making a stop here!"}
{"text":"Just ordered wings with extra vegetables. Got 4 pieces of slimy celery. No carrots. No blue cheese. Good thing the wings are good"}
{"text":"Not sure why it took me so long before my 1st visit, considering I have worked on this block of Park Road on-and-off for a long time.  I met up with my chicas after work on St. Patty's Day.  The place is small... but we didn't have to wait.  Thursday is their $2.50 Pint Night, and with some exclusions on the higher priced beer  there are still plenty of choices.  However I am almost beer illiterate, so it was like reading French when I was trying to decide on my beer order.  Ended up with a pilsner (you should be happy I remember that word...), it was still kind of hoppy for my taste.  Sometimes I just want to see the word Bud, or Miller.

I ordered a 1/4 lb. Carolina Burger.  To my surprise, it is only $5.29 for that and it even comes with 1-side.  Sweet potato fries was delicious.  Their regular fries weren't bad either.  Most of the sandwiches/salad are around $8.99.  One of the girls ordered a salad and it was huge.  

Service overall was decent, even after it got busy.  I give this place a solid approval."}
{"text":"The food gets a B- but I give it 5 stars cause I been drunk as hell up there and Uber knows exactly where it is!"}
{"text":"Best beer in Charlotte hands down, food is average and nothing to write home about, easy to find for a out of towner, if you like local micro brews come here you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been to Duckworths 5-6 times and I can say that it has gotten progressively worse each time I've gone back. The food is SUPER average and the only thing that happens consistently here is that the service is horrible. Last nights server decided it was more important to hang out in the bar and flirt with coworkers than it was to come and take our order. Food arrived, I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap. No buffalo sauce to be found and when I asked the server about it his reply was \"it's a buffalo chicken wrap for sure but there just isn't much buffalo sauce\". So instead of fixing it, he went back to the bar to hang out with coworkers. And if anyone ever tells you that their BBQ is good, they're lying. We orders the BBQ and it came out looking like mushy slop. And it tasted a little suspect. I'm pretty sure that it was frozen and then thawed and served. Completely bush league. The only reason that I have this place even 1 star was because of the beer selection. On a contrast, the location in Ballantyne does a great job! But this place? Stay away"}
{"text":"Beer o'clock, we dropped into Duckworth's with some sports on the television and a medium busy crowd of after work folks. We took two seats at the bar and ordered our beers. With the beers, a plate of \"ultimate chicken nachos\" that took about ten minutes to arrive while we sipped at beer.

You don't want to order this by yourself. In fact, it's probably too much for just two people. A full pound of nachos (we were told they fry them here in the kitchen rather than buy them already cooked) and a pound of grilled chicken with a lot of melted cheese, chopped onions and scoops of sour cream and guacamole. We had the jalapenos on the side. It went down well, though I was bummed there were no refried beans under those chips. Isn't that how nachos are supposed to be done?

Anyway, our bartender was friendly and a nice enough guy even if he is a Jets fan."}
{"text":"Awesome food with a great beer selection. Knowledgeable service coming from all of the servers. I will definitely be returning to this place soon!"}
{"text":"Draft beer selection is fantastic! The menu of draft beers is multiple pages. And to add to that they have draft specials every Tuesday and Thursday nights. Almost all draft beers on special - does not include high gravity. 

This location is very popular and gets pretty busy. That being said there is a large bar and tons of booths so you will usually get a table. The parking lot is very tight and you usually have to park somewhere down Montford Ave.  Goes with the territory for those that know Montford, but just something to be aware of if you are not familiar with the area. 

Staff is always very friendly and service has been great. Overall this is a great place to get a beer with a friend or meet up w a group."}
{"text":"This review is easy, 4 stars for the beer and 2 for the food. 

First the food, it kind of sucks, it lacks effort, flavor and originality, and 2 stars is really a gift. 

Second the beer, what they do poorly with food they make up for in their beer selection. They have a diverse, creative selection of micro brews from all across the country. The only reason I didn't give the beer 5 stars, is they don't have a worldwide selection, only 3 non-US beers. 

So go to Duckworth's have a couple beers, then go some place else to eat, then go back and have another beer."}
{"text":"Love the beer and food selection here! Had the Sweet n Bold Gold wings and they were scrumptious. Best part was that they were only 75 cents each. If you are looking for a good place to watch the game, I'd definitely recommend this place...lots of seating with good view of the tv! Can't wait to come back and watch my Panthers win the playoffs!"}
{"text":"Really nice Philly sandwich and obviously good selection of draft beer. What made it stand out was the service. Everyone was super-friendly. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We have probably driven by Duckworth's a thousand times and never really paid much attention to it.  I think the name sounding like a wealthy cartoon character or some other preconceived notion kept us away....idk, but luckily we made time to get here.

The interior is pretty big, with lots of booths and non-shared tables, which is nice, because I hate being stuffed in like cattle.  All of our servers were great and engaging, and even the managers stopped by a couple times to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.

In general they serve pub/bar food with a lot of variety, kind of like a larger and nicer version of Applebee's menu. We fired some of their Mommoo's wings, which were char grilled and underrated spicy, but I would get them again.  We also got the BBQ Chicken & Jalapeño Bacon Flatbread, which was quite large and delicious as well.  

I think their main selling point is that they have a giant variety of beer.  This doesn't move the needle much for me, but the beers we tried were good, so more power to em.

I do really want to come back here, because their menu is huge, with a lot of variety, so I would love to try some of their other options. (e.g. pizzas, burgers, etc.)"}
{"text":"The food is very competent american/bar food, definitely no slouch in that arena, but the reason to go is the dozens and dozens of taps.

And it isn't just that they have a lot of taps, it is that they have cultivated a diverse selection of hard to find styles from belgians to barleywines, and hard to find breweries from the east coast, to the midwest to the northeast. It really is great to find hometown favorites on tap (That taste so much better not in a bottle).

Tuesday and Thursday as 3.50 (including tax) beer day, very few are excluded from the special."}
{"text":"Good food! Huge portion! The price is not so bad either. We ordered summer salad, grilled salmon, and Philly cheesesteak. All pretty good! Haven't tried their fajita, but smells really good! Will try next time!"}
{"text":"Visited here a year ago and the menu included steaks. I'm so happy they cut it back and just made it what it is, a decent beer bar. I had a cheeseburger which is the house burger (they don't seem to give you options unless it is something in the menu)  The burger was delicious. She is ordered a chicken cheesesteak and asked if the owner was from Pennsylvania cause it was that good. We came to find out the rolls are from NJ. Our server was nice and polite and quick to offer beverage ideas. I know they are trying to play to the craft beer crowd and cutting back the menu which is good"}
{"text":"If you can get to Duckworth's early enough to get a table, you won't be disappointed. Our server (I think it was Brian), was helpful in selecting delicious beers and brought out samples as needed by our very large (and even louder) group. We only ate appetizers and pizzas, but they came out relatively quickly given how busy the place was and were awfully good. Their fajita nachos are big enough for about 7 people, but sadly don't have as much chicken as some other local places. They're darn good though. The prices seemed pretty reasonable for the portion sizes. The only downfall is that the beer list is a little confusing. Not very well organized, so it's helpful to have a server who knows beer and can lead you in the right direction ( or offer free samples so you can make sure you're getting what you want!)"}
{"text":"I deem thee Hickory Tavern.
This place is very similar to Hickory Tavern. Good selection of craft beer on draft, good selection of food, lots of TV's. You go here, for those items, and then depending on the quality of service and the execution of the kitchen, you have a good experience or not so good experience. 

We arrived around 6:30, and were told there was a 30 minute wait for a table. ok, not so bad. Then within 5 minutes, they seated us. We walked by 4 empty tables on the way to our seat. Not sure why the host was so far off on the seating wait time, but things were looking up. The waiter was nice and knowledgeable. I ordered a beer flight (which HT doesn't have). We order potato skins as an appetizer. Then we waited, and waited, and waited. Our waiter came back through twice and asked if we were ready to order our dinner, and we kept telling him, after the appetizer arrives, we'll order our food. On his third visit, I told him, I don't believe the appetizer is actually ever going to arrive, so let's order the food. After about 30 minutes, the appetizer finally arrived, and it was good. Real potatoes, not the frozen kind. The food arrived relatively quickly, but without our side order of fries. We waited, waited, waited. I told the waiter, you forgot the fries. We had finished the entree. we waited. And finally, the fries arrived.

The food here was good. The beer selection excellent. It was crowded. The execution on our order was poor. Not a lot of parking. Its very similar feel and menu to Hickory Tavern, with a 2x better beer selection."}
{"text":"Great bar. Many TVs and are accommodating to what you want to watch. I had the fish sandwich, which was awesome.
Beer selection and recs are amazing. Will be back again."}
{"text":"The food was great, service was fast....I ordered bbq chicken flat bread and my friend order buffalo chicken wrap with garlic fries!!!! All I can say is yess gawd ::-) !!#!###### we'll be back"}
{"text":"So I am a fan of everything Duckworths:  beer selection, food, people... everything except the parking situation here.  Except for a couple of compact spaces and few regular spaces out in front, the parking lot here can be somewhat of a deathtrap.  I usually end up parking pretty far away depending on how much I want to risk my life that day, but I just hate having to deal with the overflow from Montford Dr.... regardless... the parking situation isn't changing anytime soon, so I just deal with it.  People PLEASE!  for the love of whatever you believe in, slow down and don't hit pedestrians and other shoppers that have business here - it will not hurt you to wait another 30 seconds to get your latte or whatever it is you are zipping around the parking lot for.  I've had some near misses here.

ANYWAYS... once you survive the gauntlet traffic parking situation, you can rest easy (at least for a little bit)... have a drink to relax and let your blood-pressure recede to normal levels.

This place is usually packed - which is a good sign.  The food is solid - they have daily specials and their servers and staff are friendly and will get you what you are craving.  Pizza, beer, tacos... they have a wide range of food and rather extensive tap list.  If you go to the other Duckworth's in the area, there's an iPad you can see the latest tap list, but this location is old skool and you gotta do it on paper.  You can also check out the website for the list which is pretty upated.  http://duckworths.com/beer-list/

Overall a solid place to grab a beer/dinner after work.  Watch the parking lot though."}
{"text":"I usually avoid this Duckworths because parking is horrible here. They have a small lot that they share with Starbucks and the Relax the back store and the space are super tight so the chance is that you're going to be crammed up against a land yacht or someone who does not know how to park.

In my past few visits here, I've noticed other things that made me lower my rating of this place. The food is very average - either overspiced or just bland, there is no happy medium. And the beer selection, while they have a lot of beers on tap, the variety isn't what it used to be. On my most recent visit they only had 4 local beers on tap. Really? What a shame.

And service has been hit or miss. There used to be a female bartender here who was outstanding but not sure if she is still there. The two guys I had in my recent visit seemed to be more interested in shooting the BS with each other than assisting customers at the bar.

Sorry Duckworth's, I would expect more from your original location, but lately I just feel I get better food/service/beer selection elsewhere."}
{"text":"A nice local bar and grill.  They have a large selection of beer.  The menu is typical fare from burgers and sandwiches to pizza and quesedillas.  They do it all well and at reasonable prices.  I'm not a fan of the bbq chicken pizza(?) that was on special the last time I was there.  I and several people from my office go after work on the first Thursday of every month, so it's worth returning too.  The only drawback is that parking can be hard to find since Montford has become so popular, but that doesn't bother me since I usually walk there from my office and then walk home to my condo."}
{"text":"So at first this place was always marketed as a great place to get a Philly-style cheese steak.  Which I've had, and they are excellent.  What do I normally get here?  Wings.  Their wings (either the Hot or the Hotter Hot which are quite hot) are excellent.  Perfect amount of sauce, heat, and crisp.

Two more important things regarding Duckworth's.

1) Excellent beer list, well rotated, fresh, and with something for every palate.

2) Excellent ownership/management - They do a wonderful job taking care of their guests and are very knowledgeable on everything they serve.

Definitely a place to try for some casual dining and beer tasting.  Also a good place to watch sports, as there are plenty of TVs."}
{"text":"I came in with a large group of 20 and the staff was very accommodating. They have a large selection of draft beer and plenty of TV's to watch the game. I had the buffalo chicken sandwich which was terrible, I barely ate it. The meat tasted like a frozen Tyson patty and I didn't taste any buffalo sauce although you could see some. I will say the garlic fries were tasty. Overall it was an ok experience. I would come back just for the beer selection, not the food."}
{"text":"Yes, there are a plethora of beers on tap. Yes, there is an extensive menu to quench your tastbuds. Yes, there are enough tv's to distract you from those you really don't want to be there with in the first place (lol). 

BUT.... in order to experience all of that, you have to get service. On the first visit, it was a Friday and the place was semi-packed (we went earlier in the evening) but it took us 10 minutes for our waitress to finally acknowledge that we were sitting there (we watched her check on the table beside and behind ours). The food was good enough for us to return and the draft beer were a decent price (low as $5/glass without special). The waitress was nice and informative on the beer selections so I figured we could give this place another try. 

On our second visit (Thursday evening)... we were quickly seated and waited 15 minutes before deciding to leave. I'm not sure who our waitress was supposed to be, but there were two ladies that were assisting the tables surrounding us. One of them walked around with a pitcher to refill waters... she looked at us and saw that we didn't have any cups on our table and instead of stopping (because she had walked past the table a few times by this point) to ask if we had been helped, or if she could take our drink orders... she turned away and continued check the other customers. 

Common courtesy and basic customer service goes a long way... unfortunately I cannot say that I will give this place another try, as Park Rd is starting to expand it's 'bar and grill' options."}
{"text":"Love the moomoo wings, beers, cheesesteaks.   Been here 10x at least.  No honey beers....bummer.  lots of tvs .... 100 drafts...wow. tired of getting carded though...not flattering after u turn 50...more like offensive."}
