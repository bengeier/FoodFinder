{"text":"This place is legit! You can easily miss this place while zooming down Macleod trail so keep your eyes peeled.   Decor, it's an authentic Vietnamese restaurant don't be expecting a fancy inside. It's not what these places are about!  It's clean enough.   Service, was greeted right away and got a table with out a wait. Server was fluent in English which made me concerned what the food was gonna be like. Ya I know the server isn't the cook.   Anyways over heard her speak viet afterwards so worries subsided. Overall service was ok.   Food, we ordered XL pho dac biet which is the pho special. The bowl was large and the soup very flavourful. They don't advertise that it's msg free and I can't be 100% sure but it did pass the test and wasnt uber thirsty after and no head ache the next morning. Thumbs up!  Other half got the lemon grass chicken sate with spring roll and commented it was one of the best chicken rice dishes he's had in a while. It was spicy and you could actually taste the lemon grass.   Price, XL pho $10 something and the chicken dish was over $13.  I think this is a little high but I guess based on its location and not having to go all the way to Forrest lawn makes up for it."}
{"text":"I never would have noticed this place if it wasn't recommended by my hair stylist who happens to be from Vietnam.   There must be a million different Pho's in Calgary but most of them offer sub-par quality food. Not this one. The quality of their food is great and the chicken looks like real chicken not that fake tofu-chicken/beef hybrid thingy you get at some asian restaurants.   We were served complimentary tea while we were looking at the menu. I got the vegetable spring rolls to start with chicken satay pho rice noodle soup as my entree. Spring rolls were a little overpriced at ~$6.50 and they tasted ok. The regular size pho was large enough for me. I couldn't even finish the whole thing. The soup base was pretty good and the vegetables were fresh. Staff were polite and friendly. This place was busy with a lot of dine ins/take out orders that were happening around our check out time so it took a little while to pay for the orders.   I would definitely go back to this place again."}
{"text":"This is my other favorite Vietnamese restaurant! I come here often because it's closer to my house. I really like the flavorful broth. I always order the Vietnamese pancake. There is something about the combination of the crispy pancake, pan fried egg, pickled vegetables and dipping sauce that is so good. I would recommend the grilled squid as well."}
{"text":"The good: Food and service is excellent.  Flavor is better than most pho places in Calgary.  Menu variety is good.  The bad: Prices are significantly higher than most pho places.  A regular sized bowl of pho is around $12 here versus $8 at many other places of similar quality.  For this reason alone, I'll be going somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food is quality and well prepared. I haven't found a Pho place I enjoyed since moving from Vancouver.  This will become a regular spot for us.  Good food, smiling service, quite atmosphere."}
{"text":"I found this place through Avenue Magazine's review of pho. It lived up to the  recommendation.   The broth was clear and clean, and the taste was really good. The meat is good quality as well.   The fried chicken wings with lemon and salt and pepper sauce was tasty too.   I will be back to have more pho at this place!"}
{"text":"I am shocked. We just had the worst service picking up food from this place. The manager is rude and does not deserve to have a 5-star review. We ordered some food to go and was politely asked if we could sit down by one of the servers; after we picked the food the manager came by and asked if we could stand over by the side very rudely. The restaurant was half-empty.  Management is bad; rude and not customer friendly.  I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Lunch time at Pho Chu The was perfect for a cold weather we are having! We got to Pho Chu The at noon and was expecting it to be busy, but it was not too bad. Table was ready for us when we arrived and sat down for few min and we ordered. Service was very good and attentive. I ordered the Pho Sate (beef), i really like the thick peanut broth but it was the clearer version with a hint of spice to it. Still good, still good. The only thing I did not enjoy was the beef, it was a bit mushy, not really a nice slice of beef. The broth was hot and full of flavour! They provided a big plate of bean sprout, mint leaves, lime wedges, and I love the jalapeño it comes with added an extra kick! We got out of the place around 12:35pm! lots of time left to get back to work :)"}
{"text":"Delicous pho, passed the MSG test, a winner in my book!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are always reluctant to try unfamiliar places to get our Pho fix but reading other reviews on Yelp lead us to Pho Chu The. We were NOT disappointed! Service was friendly but what we were really seeking was the Pho! I like SPICY and they delivered BIG TIME with #19 Satay Beef Noodle Soup. Bean sprouts and basil also came out with hot peppers which was bonus points on my scorecard. Broth was delicious, beef was fresh and my wife was as impressed as I. Prices are very fair and comparable to our other \"spots\" but we have a new flavour champion!!!! One thing I will note though, my Xlrg bowl was not filled and looked comparable to my wife's regular sized bowl (in volume) and I found myself looking for more at the bottom of the bowl. I do find that often at other restaurants as well so definitely not a deal breaker but hoping for a full bowl next time, which will be soon!"}
{"text":"Been here quite regularly with my boyfriend. We are particularly picky with food especially Vietnamese food. I like their soup, it tastes even better with fat (you have to order this on side because it will make your soup greasy and lots of people don't like it). The service is not consistent hence the 4 stars. Overall this is one of the better Vietnamese restaurant in Calgary."}
{"text":"From April to July of 2011 I worked just off of Blackfoot Trail and was searching for a Pho restaurant to satisfy my cravings during the work week. I've been to a few places around the area but this restaurant with their yellow retail sign and green font text seem to speak out at me. I must've made the right decision because the day I decided to go there for lunch with a friend of mine I found a few of my other friends lurking there enjoying a peaceful lunch as well.  Nothing too special about the interior of Pho Chu The, simple it looks but simple I like - I find places that spend a lot of money in the interior of their establishments means that the quality of their food is lower than how the place looks so I was ready to sample my first bowl of Pho from this place. I ordered my usual controlled testing bowl: Pho Tai w/ Bo Vien. I also ordered Spring Rolls and of course my ritualistic Cafe Sua Da.  Man..this broth they make is delicious it reminds me a lot of my own mama's broth which to me is a super bonus because I find a lot of places make the broth either too bland or too salty but never in between. The bowl was a decent size, the noodles although not the fresh kind I can still enjoy and my only nit-pick is the fact that their beef looks scrunched up. Their spring rolls were delicious and pretty much taste like spring rolls you can find at any other restaurant.  The staff here are super friendly, always say hi accompanied with smiles and I love surprising staff members by speaking in my native tongue Vietnamese as I don't look Vietnamese at all - it's a good ice breaker ;) Whenever I am in the area I always make sure to stop by here to grab a bite to eat and for the area I believe this is the best place you could goto.  Try it and let me know what you think!"}
{"text":"If the food is good, I care less about the service...I'm not here to make friends and the last thing I wanna do is upset an employee and get something unexpected in my broth!  Some folks are just a little rough around the edges.  ;)  Unfortunately, the pho here is only decent and nothing to holler about.  My biggest gripe is the inconsistency of the broth...my first time here it was very flavorful (which brought me back), but the other day it was only average.  Most folks will enjoy it, regardless.  My other complaint is the limited amount of protein.  I've ordered the L and XL Dac Biet (special) on different occasions and both servings offered very little meat compared to other shops.  Needless to say, I won't be coming back as there are plenty of \"decent\" pho shops closer to my place of residence.  In addition, trying to find parking is hard enough, so you REALLY have to like this place. ;)"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Pho. Good price for good quality of food. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"So who's review do you trust for your favourite Vietnamese pho place?  Everyone has their favourite for one reason or another. For me this one ranks as a very good one based on their pho.   We haven't been here for a few years as we it wasn't particularly memorable at that time despite all of their great reviews.  So we gave it another chance and this time they impressed.  The pho was nicely flavoured, bean sprouts fresh and they give jalapeño if you care for it.   The noodles are cooked al dente and seem more slippery (due to a bit of fat in the soup?) as my son noticed but they were fine.   Beef was of higher than average quality and the beef flank actually had a beefy taste.  I think this is partially due to the thicker cut but also it had the nice chewy fatty gristle attached to it. The grilled squid appetizer was nicely done also. Will try the rice dishes next time to see if this is a one trick Vietnamese place or whether they can mix things up. Service was typical noodle efficiency and friendliness."}
{"text":"Waitress was really friendly and took my order right away. The broth caught me by surprise on my pho tai soup order. Very flavorful..star anise maybe? Portion was large and garnishes provided were just enough without being wasteful.  I am trying to write this while eating my soup lol! Overall a yummy bowl of soup! I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Solid place for a bowl of beef pho. The large is a nice big portion and accompaniments include jalapenos in addition to the standard sprouts, basil and lime. Only downside is that prices are a touch higher than equivalent restaurants, at $13 for a large."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered here was fabulous. Sorry I pictures ate too quick lol not to mention we came in at 5:30 and they closed at 6:00pm. We felt bad so we asked if it's too late since we were the only customers at that time. They assured us it was no problem at all just that last call was 5:45 so order quick :-)  We ordered deep fried wontons, spring rolls, shrimp and pork salad rolls and pho beef sate.  The wontons were awesome with green onions and I believe garlic inside with pork . Very flavorful and there was equal amounts meat to wonton. Shrimp/pork salad rolls were fresh and rolled tight so it didn't fall apart when you dip in the peanut sauce. The peanut sauce was all that, boasting with peanut flavor with a bit of sweetness. I like the peanut sauce to be a thicker texture so this sauce was on point.   The pho broth was super flavorful with high quality meat in it. Hefty helping of both meat and noodles in the bowl. Loved every bit of it.  If you're looking for quick and delicious pho then check this place out."}
{"text":"Only the second time I've had Vietnamese food in Calgary and looks like we picked a winner. Prices are decent and they have some mixtures of meat and veg in their soup I hadn't seen anywhere else before. Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"You know it's gotta be good Vietnamese when you're the only one speaking English in the place!  Everything that comes out suggests an owner that really goes through their produce and ingredients and selects the freshest vegetables, seafood and quality cuts of meat.   The Won Ton broth is super hot and tasty and I LOVE these wontons!  I don't do it that often, but I couldn't help it tonight - I just ate till it hurt. It's that good!  They need to rename this place Pho Chu It's The Best Vietnamese You've Had!"}
{"text":"Prices are outrageous for the amount of food they give you. We ordered 2 noodle soups, a cheap rice dish, and a starter and it was close to $50. Don't bother ordering the XL noodles... They put the same amount of noodles and meat as the smaller size and serve in a bigger bowl and drench with more broth. The service was slow and I had to ask twice for things like extra bowls and forks for the kids. The restaurant had about 5 other tables filled so it wasn't busy. Gave 2 stars because the kids enjoyed their rice dish with the overly sweet fish sauce. The chicken was cooked nicely."}
{"text":"Just experienced the best Pho in Calgary, I travel to Vietnam often and have tried some of the best pho tai in the world and I compare this to the real Vietnam experience, I was referred this place by my friends I travel with. I am hooked, I can't believe I just discovered it recently and when eat here, I always bump into people I know, everyone loves it like I do, if you like Vietnamese Food? This is for sure a must, pho is my favorite but I did try a few other items and they are all great! I learned one thing from my Asian friends, they ask for steamed bean sprouts rather than fresh ones, no idea why. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Portions are decent, but they are a bit on the pricier side.  We ordered #18a (beef flank, tripe, and other flank noodle soup) and #38a on rice ( sate chicken and spring rolls).  The broth was very good.  Lots of flavour and had a good body to it.  Meat quality was also very good.  Ingredients seemed fresh.  Would come here again if in the area, but the price does deter me from being a regular."}
{"text":"This even surpasses Thuan An back home even!  a very flavourful, caramel-like coffee taste to it...best thing is, esp. if you're as impatient as i am, is they already pre-make this earlier in the day so you don't have to wait til it drips lol...  Still tastes fresh ;)  Next time i'll try the pho, heard from a vietnamese owner even that he only goes to this one here..."}
{"text":"Tasty broth!! I don't like the selection of Vietnamese restaurants in Calgary these days but these guys don't disappoint!! One word of caution though - you may get the MSG after affects. It might be why their ph broth is so tasty. But the meat in the ph is good and not dry like many other places. It's worth a try if you're not \"allergic\" to MSG. (As I finish this review I have finally fully perked up after my long nap from my MSG induced slumber. Yes, I did so happen to eat here for lunch earlier today.)"}
{"text":"Some people (me) dream of pho. These dreams usually involve mountains of perfectly al dente rice noodles, rivers of thick, rich broth and me riding on a crunchy spring roll boat eating and slurping as I go along. If I could actually turn this dream into a reality, it'd be straight out of this restaurant pronounced Fa Choo Tay.   Home of my freak food fantasies and arguably the best and most authentic broths in Calgary, this places gets 5/5 stars for its pho and extra points for friendly service and less mean mugging than the usual pho joint in 'the hood'. Plus, I can usually leave here with less of a MSG hangover than most places which makes it a A+ in my books. And if carbs and eggs are your thing, make sure you try the bot chien. Chunks of crispy pan fried rice cakes, fried again with eggs and served with a tangy sauce and pickled veggies - need I say more?   Now as far as decor goes, this is your standard Vietnamese restaurant with no frills and self serve utensils. But hey, who cares about decor when you can spend 15 minutes immersed nose deep in a pho facial? Certainly not me - I Pho(sho) Chu(se) The food here!"}
{"text":"Service is like at any other Asian -ish restaurant. But, the food is enjoyable always. Everytime I am in Calgary I am sure to come here. It always delivers. They have a great selection of delicious dishes."}
{"text":"The broth in their pho is quite good.  The vermicelli bowls were HUGE.  The service was actually very good compared to other Vietnamese restaurants.  Their spring rolls were a tad bit small but still tasty.  Washrooms were clean clean clean."}
{"text":"Great tasting Vietnamese egg pancake. Fresh and the potatoes were so so delicious with the egg ... really good. Soup was fresh, very fresh bean sprouts. My lunch companion felt that the soup and other reviews exaggerated on the \"superb-ness\" of this joint though! And although I thought it was really good ... was it four or five stars? I think three is good for our combined experience.   The waitress, totally gorgeous, couldn't explain how the three types of beef in the soup were different or what they were. She didn't know. We joked after she left that if we weren't so hungry we'd tell her to go back and ask the cook! Yet .. we just relied on the menu to decide what to order. Yelp helped us choose the egg/potato pancake so thank you Yelp!   But as for we being the only ones speaking English in the restaurant, not really. Was it so super authentic? I don't know. I guess it just depends on your taste buds, your experience and your perceptions.   It was a little cold in the restaurant, the soup was good."}
{"text":"It's hard to notice a small restaurant on Macleod Trail unless you know what you're looking for. This Vietnamese restaurant definitely is worth a stop.   Flavour wise, it hits the mark. I had the charbroiled shrimp paste, pork ball, and spring roll on vermicelli. The shrimp was very delicious and had a \"made by mom\" taste (having tried Vietnamese home cooking). The pork ball was pleasantly surprising having hints of lemongrass. Overall a great meal. I also had a taste of the Vietnamese egg pancake, which is now one of my favourite Vietnamese dishes to eat. It was very hearty and had flavour that is hard to explain. The dipping sauce complimented the dish well.   The restaurant is clean and the service is friendly. Stop on by if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"We came here at the recommendation of a very opinionated, Vietnamese friend.  \"It's the only place in Calgary that I'll eat pho, other than my mom's.\"  Preeeeeeeetty big claim.  The pho here is the best I've had in a long time.  The broth was so flavorful and the quality of the meat surpasses many other pho places I've been in my life.  I also ordered a Vietnamese iced coffee, which was delightful!    Service was quick.  The interior is your typical, gaudy Vietnamese/Chinese decor, but it looks a heck-of-a-lot better than the poor, dingy pho shop across the way.  I thoroughly enjoyed my time here and that bowl of pho definitely got rid of whatever I had left of a hangover.  Considering I never visited any other pho places in Calgary,  I'll give this one a solid four-stars."}
{"text":"Their pho is not the best in Calgary but I give it a 8/10. However their bot chien (fried egg pancake) is sooo good and the main reason I come back. It comes with pickled vegetables which most places don't give and if you know how to make the dipping sauce right (half vinegar Half soy sauce with some chilli satay and a bit of fish sauce) then you may fall in love! DONT EAT THE FRIED EGH PANCAKE PLAIN THOUGH - that's boring and gross"}
{"text":"We stopped in after a shopping marathon at Chinook, and I will agree with most reviews here, the food is really good.  In terms of freshness, it was pretty fantastic.  The pho was one of the best I've had in a long time.  Broth was perfect but does have an undertone of what I think is star anise or clove, I don't mind that but my husband found it a little overwhelming.  Points lost on the following:   1.) way smaller portion sizes than other pho places, the large is comparable to a kids size and the x large is comparable to a medium.  I agree with another reviewer that it is not substantial for Pho.  No where near enough noodles for an extra large and if my husband can finish an extra large and finish off mine, it wasn't enough food.  2.) We also ordered 2 subs but found some resistance with the owners because apparently subs are for take out only? As we were eating in for pho, I didn't see the big deal.  What I assume the was the owner, said it was fine and would make it to go, but we wanted to eat it with the pho so found that exchange quite bizarre. Eventually, after 3 other patrons who came in well after us were served and whom I assume were regulars, we finally got our pho first, then after some time the subs later.  Did not care for the attitude and delayed service especially since we were first timers there and would likely become regulars as we often are in the area for work.   3.) price points were much higher here as well, at least 20% higher in fact.  I absolutely have no issue paying more when the food is good but the portion sizes and service should counterbalance the extra cost.  All in all, a solid 3, could have easily been a 4 star but to have the issues listed above on a first visit will keep me on the fence about coming back when the pho hankering hits."}
