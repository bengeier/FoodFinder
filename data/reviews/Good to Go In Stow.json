{"text":"Great food, great service!  They have soup, salad, sandwiches, croissants (and more)  ready to grab and run, or they will make items from scratch while you wait. Take-out or sit-down. Clean place, friendly people. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nice place, very friendly owners.  They have some regular items and specials as well, and even though their menu is limited, you're bound to find something you like.  Hash brown muffins are fun and very good, sandwiches are excellent.  They'll cater to special dietary needs, so if you're gluten-free or trying paleo (like a lot of my friends and family), they're willing to work with you.  Pick up lunch or dinner for later, they make it all there.  They don't seem to get a lot of dine-in business, so sometimes the things you order come out separately, but it's not a big deal."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast sandwiches and home fries! I had to force myself to stop eating the potatoes since I only got one order to share."}
{"text":"Get there when they open for the Ham or Spinach Hash-brown Muffins! I cannot get enough of these. While you're there, look in the cases for fresh prepared dishes that will knock your socks off. I cannot get enough of this place!"}
{"text":"This place offers great homemade food at a reasonable price.  They will also deliver which is a great service for those who need it.  Very good menu which changes on a regular basis.  The catering service is really good - high quality food instead of the normal bland catering fare."}
{"text":"They have changed their salads... much bigger... more variety.... and it's now a weekly stop on our travels.  I am a regular BBQ sauce addict... there is a pint in my fridge at all times... tangy, sweet goodness that goes on anything.  Over the holidays they had all in one meals available... we are looking forward to Easter... no more getting a huge ham for just 2 people!  Daily soup special is fun... pepperoni rolls for $1 make a great lunch add on with the chili!"}
{"text":"Found this place randomly while passing through. Great fresh food and even better service."}
{"text":"Excellent!  So fresh and home made.  Truly an exceptional restaurant/deli/catering company.    We stopped in and ate their lasagna, pizza rolls and salad.  Great friendly service. Fair priced. Large portions.  Great place to eat in or take home.  Great selection of foods.  Will be back, often"}
