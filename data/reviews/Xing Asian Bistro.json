{"text":"The Banh Mi Sliders YUM!!!!!"}
{"text":"Xing is now Latin Asian Fusion. 
Their new menu is now posted and they will be switching over on May 1st. I hope this new menu works a lot better than what they started with. I'll wait a couple weeks and see how it goes.

I wish them luck."}
{"text":"my favorite thing on the menu is the bulgogi beef taquitos. it is worth the wait. I also get the green tea and mango ice cream for dessert. just ask the waiter for a scoop of each."}
{"text":"My mom and I went to Lake Las Vegas to have a mother-daughter weekend together.  We walked down to get some dinner and saw the menu and thought it looked good - and since it was Thursday night decided to give it a try for Thursday buy one get one free food and drinks.  

Here's how it went...

Kalbi beef ribs were slightly spicy and VERY (and I mean VERY) salty.  Served with double starch Hawaiian style - plain rice, and macaroni salad (also too salty).  

The \"lemongrass\" shrimp skewers with eel sauce were SO freaking salty that my mom and I could not eat them at all. You couldn't taste lemongrass for sure - in fact he couldn't taste anything but salt.  

We kindly told the server we couldn't eat them.  I have high blood pressure, and I was afraid to even try.  Our server took them back to the chef and said that he tasted them and nearly fell over. He couldn't believe how salty they were and told the server it was because of a new prep cook.  

Also, be aware that their \"sticky rice\" is NOT the Thai kind you're thinking of. It's just rice. Rice that has no butter or oil.  So it just kind of sticks together. It was sad. :(  I think it was the only edible thing on the plate I ate it.

I requested no wontons on the ahi poke salad, but they left out the cucumbers as well - so it was just  giant beef stew sized pieces of so-so grade tuna over kelp salad, sprinkled with sesame seeds. The portion was huge - had to have been 1/2 pound of fish there. Sounds like a good deal, but I like quality over quantity. 

The wonton soup was good - big portion. But the water chestnuts had an odd tangy flavor that made me go ...hmmmm... have these gone bad or something...?

The Cabernet and Pinot Noir were surprisingly decent. That's all I have to say about that.

IMPORTANT:  You know the \"green tea\" ice cream that was mentioned in someone else's review as funny tasting and almost \"nutty\"?  That's because it was actually *pistachio* with no nuts in it.  I really hope no one with a nut allergy orders this.

Anyhow. Everything was so... well... bad, and we just felt sorry for the server. She was just so sweet. That's why they get 2 stars.  She completely comp'd the dinner which was NOT what we were looking for, but I think she felt so bad that she had to do it. 

Do yourself a favor and just don't bother.  McDonalds would even be better.  And I don't EAT at McDonald's."}
{"text":"tried this place out on the weekend. Wasn't too such about the food so I played it safe and had the teriyaki chicken with rice. The waitress was kind enough to give us plantain chips, we really liked them and the waitress was awesome to give more every time we asked lol 

The teriyaki chicken itself was pretty good alot tastier then yoshinoya on Maryland in my opinion. chicken was tender and the sauce was real good.

I probably wouldn't drive out here just to eat but if you're in the area there's no harm in trying this place out. Not to mention the guy playing drums for free entertainment."}
{"text":"Food was good - tapas style Asian food. I ordered Banh Mi sliders and they were good. Looked different but tasted like banh mi's. I ordered sticky rice and was excited when they had hoisin sauce. That side was on point. The other dished ordered were all eaten and I was told they were good. Disappointed they didn't have liquor but only wine or beer - had to order sangria. Server was nice and the place was kind of quiet. Either way, I liked it!"}
{"text":"Waitress was very nice.... That's where the good things about this restaurant end!  

A group of people I work with and I came here for dinner and tried a number of dishes.  All had a funny flavor to them and we didn't come close to finishing any of them.  Even the green tea ice cream tasted weird! (More like almond or some other nut). 

They only have wine and beer, maybe because they only ave one person working in the place (besides the cook).  They ad some unique
Beers, but the waitress had no idea what they tasted like so you are on you own...

This whole Lake Las Vegas area was a ghost town."}
{"text":"5/12/12 - For our wedding anniversary dinner with our kids, I could have gone to the golden arches and get better service and left happy. I've experience bad service in the past but this place tops it all. If not for the manager coming out to speak to us, I would have given this place ZERO stars. The food is not bad but we did not even get silverware and napkins to enjoy the food before it got cold. Drinks was not offered. We only got water. We had to ask for drinks for our kids. They wanted milk. My kids and wife got there orders. I elected to leave hungry and go back to our hotel a mile away to get something there. I'm hoping the staff takes my comment positively to make improvements overall. In this economy bad service will kill a business."}
{"text":"Met Judd and Lynn L. for dinner out on the Lake. The venue is beautiful with it's dark woods and sporadic Asian decoration. Having opened within ten days of Montelago taking over, it still has some improvements in decor and quality of food.

The cuisine is more Chinese American than traditional with many of the dishes geared toward the fast food crowd. The agreed favorites were the Orange Chicken and Shrimp and Veggie Tempura. The poultry dish was surprising tangy and possessed a more complex variety of flavors. The shrimp were lightly battered and fried to a golden perfection. The fried veggies are not your typical variety, instead they use the same mix of broccoli, pea pods, carrots, pearl onions, and water chestnuts as they do in many of their other dishes. The Mongolian Beef didn't possess any kick. The Kung Pao Chicken had some nice heat that crept up on the taste buds, but they had forgotten the peanuts. The main complaint about both dishes was the excessive use of cornstarch to thicken up the sauces. We had also tried the Orange Beef and Sweet and Sour Pork. Both were inedible. The former was cooked to jerky consistency and the veggies lost their vibrant color and crisp texture. The latter was pungent, but did not taste anything like sweet and sour. No onions, peppers, or pineapple. Our waitress had to telling us the difference between this dish and the Orange Chicken was the green onions sprinkled on top of the chicken. The choice of white or brown rice is a welcomed touch, but placing everything on top of it was not the best presentation. All of this might sound like a lot of food, but the serving size was not that large. We could have polished it off, if some of the dishes did not disagree with us. 

The main reason why Xing gets two instead of one star is due to the server. Rebecca is the only front of the house attendant and listened to our suggestions. I would like to see them succeed."}
