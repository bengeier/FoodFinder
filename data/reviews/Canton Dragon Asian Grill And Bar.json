{"text":"Found the Canton Dragon by accident and glad we did. Friendly staff, great food. By the second list they remembered us and now know our likes. Candy runs a good shop"}
{"text":"The service was fast and wait staff friendly. The food and drink on the other hand, probably the worst food I've eaten. I ordered a Thai tea and orange chicken. I returned the Thai tea because it was just awful. I ate half of the kinda warm and soggy orange chicken. I didn't return it as I was eating lunch with my son and didn't want to make a deal as he seemed to be enjoying his time. I told him when we were leaving that we probably wouldn't be back and he said \"yeah, I get it.\""}
{"text":"Service is rushed, our party of 5 had food come out at three different intervals, the server came by and was pushing dessert on us as we were still eating dinner, beef and broccoli was 90% broccoli - barely any meat. I REALLY want to like this place because the food is decent, but they just cant seem to get a handle on the service, timing or portions. Its a shame."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out last week. The overall atmosphere of the place is very nice! It's not too loud and It isn't too busy, there were only a few other tables eating while we were there. The staff was very nice and friendly and it was pretty fast. We didn't have to wait long for our food (which was cooked fresh) and I thought it was delicious. The orange chicken was perfect. It wasn't hard to chew like orange chicken I have had before. It was perfectly light and crispy. Also my shrimp egg foo yung was delicious!   The only problem we had was when we used the Yelp coupon ($30 for $20). We ordered an appetizer during happy hour (which was half off, because of happy hour) and they told us because we used the coupon from Yelp we shouldn't have received half off on the appetizer. I don't know if they are telling us we shouldn't have ordered it or what, but we showed them our $30 for $20 coupon when we ordered. They didn't have to give us half off. Overall though, it is good food and I would recommend it to anyone looking to fulfill your chinese food craving!"}
{"text":"Waitress #1 spills hot tea on my mom, we specifically asked for a shrimp dish because we had a vegetarian with us and they served us chicken instead, we were charged an 18% gratuity for a coupon which didn't mention one at all and when we asked for the manager, Waitress #1 said they weren't there (is no one in charge?) only to find out from Waitress  #2 that Waitress #1 is the owner... That was the last time we visited the Canton Dragon. No fortune cookies either..."}
{"text":"Canton Dragon is a wonderful neighborhood restaurant. I love their Moo Goo Gai Pan, Beef with Broccoli, and Happy Family. They cooked the food to our specific liking. Great friendly service with a smile! I recommend this restaurant! ...Annie G."}
{"text":"I ordered  combo egg foo young with just shrimp and pork and sauce on the side. Started eating the first of three patties and no shrimp. Called server over who brought it back to the kitchen. It was confirmed first patty had no shrimp but they opened up others and said there were shrimp in the others and that they only use 2 shrimp per order. I said if I wanted a pork patty I would have ordered it that way and explained that there should be shrimp in each patty. Server apologized. I then decided to order shrimp egg foo young so as to be assured I received shrimp. When my dish came there was no sauce with it.  I had to ask server to reheat sauce already at table that was cold. The first 2 patties had shrimp, but the third patty only had one tiny quarter piece of shrimp. At this point I did not bother telling server because kitchen was obviously inattentive. I have been a patron of this establishment since it opened and have ordered shrimp egg foo young and combo egg foo young quite often and never had this experience. I truly enjoy their food and will give Canton Dragon one more chance before it is off my list. It was not busy and neither the owner nor manager came by to see how things were. Truly a disappointing experience when in the past it has been enjoyable. No reason why kitchen should not be able to portion shrimp among three patties particularly when an order was sent back because one patty had no shrimp. However, I want to emphasize that I have always found servers and staff friendly and the restaurant has a pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've never eaten at the restaurant itself, opting instead to either pick up my food or have it delivered since I only work a block away.  I have loved their food and consider it the 2nd best Chinese food restaurant in the Phoenix Metro area.  The employees are always courteous and the service is very quick."}
{"text":"I almost didn't come to this restaurant because of the reviews I read. I'm glad I did anyway. I had a great lunch and great service. This is walking distance from the hospital where I'd been all week staying with a family member. This place was convenient and delicious and a nice break from the hospital. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here twice now, and it was EXCELLENT both times!  We were a little weary at first because we read a review on here saying that the Orange Chicken wasn't very good.  Anyhow, I ordered a dish that had chicken and broccoli (It might be called just that?), and my wife had the orange chicken.  Both were EXCELLENT!  The chicken and broccoli has a light sauce, very little seasoning, and just the right balance of flavor.  It was savory!  I have ordered it both times because I like it so much.  The orange chicken that my wife had (we shared each dish) was only slightly sweet, and we liked that because it wasn't overpowering.  It had just the right amount of sweetness, and excellent flavor.  I'm partial to the chicken and broccoli, but both were very good.  We have ordered from JOY-FUL around the corner, and this by far was better.  If you go to Joy-ful, get the shrimp and broccoli, or the Kung Pao chicken...do not get the chicken with the \"special sauce\",,,they claim its the most popular dish, but trust me it is gross.  A very weird flavor.  Anyhow, until we move out of Arizona, we will be dining Chinese food at Canton Dragon!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for good egg foo young or wonton soup this place is excellent. However, everything else I have tried here has been so-so. I would only recommend it for certain dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"My wife and I are vacationing and decided to use a Groupon to eat here.  There were few people in the place when we arrived and now we know why!  I ordered sweet and sour shrimp and two of them still had the shells on them beneath the fried batter! Just imagine biting into that.  Our Groupon costs $20 for $30 of food.  When the bill came it was $32 which meant I only had to pay $2.  When presented with the Groupon the bill jumped to $16 and the owner refused to change it!  Needless to say, we won't be going back and wanted to warn others, especially if you have a Groupon"}
{"text":"Not a bad spot if you are getting lunch as they have good lunch special deals.  Restaurant stays pretty busy which is a good sign.  Service is fine and time of wait for food to come out is decent.    My problem with this place is the food is very inconsistent.  My first few impressions of the place went very well.  Food was delicious, hot and ready.  Then there were a few times after that, that the same dishes I usually order taste different or bland... sometimes tasteless.    It is worth a shot if you are around the neighborhood or live in Scottsdale.  I wouldn't press my luck driving down here just for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Decent food, but it seems to be getting worse than better not to sure why.... they just got a remodeled so it's very pretty but they need to focus more on remodeling the food"}
{"text":"I adore this place. While they've had some issues in the past, whoever they have hired to cook now is amazing. The egg foo young is seasoned well and fluffy, and not a big hockey puck like most place in Scottsdale. The soups are wonderful with tasty clear broths. Last time I ordered the spicy eggplant with tofu and was not disappointed. It's time to retry the moo shu pork (for the record Wang's Express on Bell and Tatum is the underappreciated superstar of the moo shu.) but so far, so good for the new staff in the kitchen."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here for several years.  Where else can you find happy hour from 11:00a.m. to 8:00p.m with very inexpensive drinks and appetizers during that time.  The food is always delicious and plentiful.  Best egg foo young we have ever tasted.  Also enjoy the dragon special chicken,  mongolian beef, kung pao chicken, pot stickers and the beef and scallops.  My wife likes her food extra spicy and is never disappointed.  I am allergic to shrimp and they always remember to put a special note on the order even if we have not ordered a shrimp dish.  A main reason for returning here time and time again is the staff.  Candie, the owner is warm and friendly and assures we are well taken care of, her daughter is really sweet.  Our favorite servers Phoebe and Anna are a blast to talk with and always stop by to say hello even if we are not in their section.  All the servers are professional and Michael (Mo Mo) extremely quick.  My wife and I are both in the food and hospitality business and can not understand some of the previous reviews.  We have tried other Chinese restaurants and were never impressed until we  came to the Canton Dragon.  We highly recommend this restaurant.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been to Canton Dragon twice both were horrible experiences. The first time I purchased a Groupon $20 for $30 and ordered about $60 worth of food when I arrived for pickup I was told the Groupon was for dine-in only, I didn't want to argue I just paid and went, the food was ok at best, to be really honest I prefer Panda Express to this place.  The second time my wife found the Groupon online again and we read through and it didn't say dine-in anywhere on the Groupon, when I went in I was once again told it was for dine-in, I showed the Groupon and she agreed that it did not say it anywhere but told me it was a mistake and she would not accept it. This time I chose not to pay the full amount ($40) (as I wasn't really happy with the food the first time) and left. Lesson learned I will not ever go here again, and I would advise those who use Groupon to avoid it as well. Once again the food is ok nothing special, I'd say 2 out of 5 stars the 1 out of 5 stars given is for the less than helpful staff I delt with on two occasions."}
{"text":"I am not a Chinese food fan so I will  keep this brief and leave the reviewing to the more qualified Yelpers.  I hadn't been to Canton Dragon in three years, but was drawn to give it another shot after purchasing a Groupon Now! deal ($20 for $30 of Chinese fare) the other night. The place was just as unremarkable as I remember, but the spacious dining room area, ambiance and charming service made up for the marginal cuisine.    My dining companion and I split crab angels, orange chicken, and scallop with garlic sauce. The crab angels were a tad overstuffed with cream cheese, but the outsides were crisp and quite good. The orange chicken was pretty standard - thoroughly breaded with a hint of spiciness - and did not disappoint. The scallops, however, were less than spectacular; it also lacked the shrimp the menu claimed to be among the contents of the dish.   Okay. I'm done. Lesson learned: I really don't like Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Im a visitor on a contract job in scottsdale....and have been eating lunch in this restaurant in the past week bcos it's very close to my work place...but today I went there as usual and after my lunch I forgot my phone (Samsung s 7) on the table ...I remember on my way back to work in like 4 mins...I got there and they said they can't find my phone ....after I insist on calling the cops and pulling the surveillance..one of the workers said she would check the trash...lo n behold they brought out my phone .. claiming they found it in d trash ...who on earth cleans a table and not notice a brand new Gold Samsung s 7 without a case... These people are crooks be extra careful if you have to go there ...."}
{"text":"I was surprised the food quality of  this restaurant, simple but really good as a Chinese's standard."}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food I have had in Phoenix. I love that this is a small place and that the food is consistent. Very nice staff and I think the owner served us. Definitely more comfortable than the jade palace around the corner, better food too"}
{"text":"Both food quality and quantity has degraded.  The spring roll you get is now made with some kind of mushy paste thing instead of recognizable vegetables and meats. I used to only eat half the portion and take the rest home, now it's small enough to eat in one sitting."}
{"text":"This place was accomodating for us, since they were open on Christmas and served Roast Duck, which we very happy about it since we tried going to other places and did not have it. The staff there was very friendly and because of their service we would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Gosh!!! Where do I start? Ordered lunch special. Lo mein tastes like crap plus they served me with white rice instead of fried rice like I ordered. Worst place ever. I'm definitely not going back. These people are fake Asians. They don't have any regular again food. Gosh horrible!!!! Wish I can give them zero stars."}
{"text":"Ordered for first time last night, after rave reviews from a friend.  Should've read the reviews first.  The Hot and Sour soup was good, so was the Calamari.  For entrees, played it safe, got Genl Tso's Chicken and Sesame Chicken.  Do NOT recommend these two entrees.  Dry, over breaded Chicken Balls... no sauce,  no flavor, very blah.... my friend orders more flavorful, exciting choices.  Maybe I will, maybe not?"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food with quality white meat and no gristle!"}
{"text":"I don't get it. Probably the worst Chinese I have ever had ... orange chicken frozen pre made and lemon grass tofu soggy and weird."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Order it for take out pretty regularly - my moms boyfriend says the Egg Foo Young is die for, and I have never ordered a dish from them I haven' t liked.  They are very reasonably priced, and very frequently have a groupon now for 20 bucks for 30 dollars worth of food.  If your craving some great chinese food definitely give them a chance."}
{"text":"Had CD for dinner; first time eating there.  The first plus was that they delivered to my home...and it was super fast!  I also enjoyed the menu; lots of options.  When the food came, it was pretty good.  Exactly what you would expect for a place like this...not over the top wonderful but definitely better than its competitors.  Overall, pretty good inexpensive dinner and its definitely become my go to Asian delivery"}
{"text":"Three stars because of the food. Attentiveness and customer service would have gotten them more stars.  Walked in with few tables full and yet we were asked to wait.  We had asked for a booth and although we could see two empty booths that were clean, we were still asked to wait by the bar.  I guess that is one way to get people to order liquor but we are not really drinkers.  15 minutes later we were almost ready to walk out.  You see, there were not that many people there to rationalize the wait.   Just as we were about to step out, they called us to a booth but the booth was still dirty.  More time wasted.  Why not show us to the clean ones?  Next came the wait to get menus.  I finally asked the busboy if we were going to get menus at some point.  He gave us menus.  Then the wait to take the order.  No reason for all this slowness.  Get your act together.    Ordered scallion pancakes which were pretty good and not greasy as an appetizer.  Seabass with ginger and black bean sauce and salt and pepper pork chops.  Both dishes came with brown rice and were very good. Good portions too.  So improve your service and you will get 5 stars next time."}
{"text":"We love this place. The sea bass is our favorite. We always come back for it. The lunch specials are great too. The are always friendly."}
{"text":"If I could give it even less than a star I would. I ordered food for the last time last night. $20 minimum delivery and since I live 4 miles from the store, I was charged a $4 delivery charge, plus I tipped on top of it. That is fine. The problem started when I ate the food. Nothing I ordered was good!  The orange chicken, while dressed with an orange wheel was abomidable. Absolutely no flavor at all. It tasted like I took chicken out of my freezer and fried it. That's it. No seasoning, no flavor, no sauce.  I got the crab puffs(or whatever their terminology is there). Where in the world was the cream cheese? It tasted like sugar!!! How does someone mess up a crab puff. I couldn't even choke an entire one down!  Then the \"egg roll\" order I added on to meet the delivery requirement.....Took one bite and it made me want to throw up! Beyond terrible!  I ordered late at night and after receiving the terrible food and trying it, the store was closed. I called back in today to tell them how dissatisfied I was with the food, and not only was I called a \"liar\" by the person who answered the phone, I was told they can't do anything because I was a liar. I have never been spoken to like this before, and would never speak to one of my customers like this. I offered to drive to them with the food, which I kept to prove to them how terrible it was, but she told me to call 911. I have no idea what this restaurant is thinking, or how they teach their employees to act, but clearly calling a customer a liar and then telling me to call 911 is completely unreasonable.   The food is overpriced and terrible. I don't mind paying for overpriced food, but when I couldn't even eat more than a single bite, that is not right!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  We go probably every other week and it is the best Chinese food I have ever had, and it is always consistent and made fresh.  It is a good place for anyone and everyone, including one person by themselves or couples, families and kids.  My mother is in a wheelchair and we are treated like family when we eat there.  Food portions are huge and they offer new or different dishes at times as well as have a full bar and desserts."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I come here for lunch periodically and the food is always consistent and really delicious.  I love that I can add more vegetables to my Moo Goo Gai Pan or House Chow Mein, etc... for a small upcharge.  Prices are very reasonable.   Service during lunch hour is pretty darn good and they get you seated/served/checked out within a reasonable time frame but don't make you feel rushed either. Ambiance is nice as well."}
{"text":"I'm torn! I should give this place 1* but gonna give it 2 instead. The first time I ate here was for lunch. I had one of their lunch specials - shrimp in lobster sauce or something like that and the BF ordered crispy chicken without whatever sauce they slather over it. All was mediocre. The servers were nice & friendly and the space was clean. I really wanted to like this place. It was close to home and finding a conveniently good chinese place is a heaven sent. Not too long ago I got sick. I was craving for a nice bowl of Wor WonTon soup. I called in the order for two people (not for the BF but thinking of the next day -- so selfish!). The BF picked it up on his way back from the gym. I was extremely excited to dive in this \"broth of life\".  It was far from bringing me back to life. The broth was flavorless! I could do hellah better with packaged ramen!! There were... hmmm... let's see... all of two wontons in the whole soup. Glad the order was for two: 1 wonton for today, 1 for tomorrow! Also, I swirled my spoon 'round'n'round and  around again looking for some crustaceous morsels. I thought out loud to the BF that shrimp should come in the soup. For 9 buckaroos, he said it better comes in a school of 'em. (does \"school\" applies only to fish?) Anyhow, they did their math correctly though - there's 1 shrimp to go with the 1 wonton for today and the other shrimp to go with the wonton tomorrow. BTW, I'm a queen of doctorin'up flavorless dishes, but this bowl of soup was a loss cause. I'm still trying to recover from my flu. Go figure!"}
{"text":"This is the best Asian food in town!!! Me and my husband went for some dinner on a Monday night with my two kids. We order roast duck, combo egg fu yung , and the beef mignon, oh my gosh the roast duck was perfect with rich flavors ,  egg fu yung was so fluffy n yummy and beef mignon was my favorite. The beef was very tender, love it !! The service was excellent. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Wow ! All I can say it's wow ! I couldn't believe a small little restaurant in the plaza would have quality like this! The beef mignon was out of the world ! So tender it literally just melted in my mouth! And the shrimp are huge !!!!!! And my wife loves their KP chicken ! Prefect level of spicy & they actually use chicken tender !!of course the service was wonderful , don't forget they have happy hour almost all day !!! This is now be our favorite restaurant in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Writing this from the lobby, as i wait for my food. Why did i get here so early? Well, i ordered online and they didn't check their inbox. 2nd time in a row.  It was easier to order online because of a language barrier that can creep in over the phone sometimes.  They rushed the order through and I was walking out within 10 minutes.  The food is generally above average, the crab angels and hot & sour soup are great and we have been up and down the noodle dishes.  Avoid the eggrolls (weak) and General Tso's chicken or other red-sauce based dishes... they are too sweet and have a gentle scent of ketchup (not kidding, unfortunately).  Many other good dishes here, including the Chicken Katsu, and Chicken w/Garlic Sauce.    We live close and return to Canton Dragon somewhat regularly.  Obviously the online-order screwup isn't a deal breaker.  When they have screwed up an order, they are fast to offer a replacement or credit the account for next time. We will continue to return.  Edit: about two weeks after this incident, they removed the online menu and ordering, slightly remodeled the interior, and added happy hour drink and app specials.  They claim to be making menu adjustments, and I look forward to exploring them."}
{"text":"I'm feeling generous tonight, and am willing to splurge on the second star.  Mom was in the hospital across the street, and really wanted some hot and sour soup and chicken chow mein. Went across the street with my roommate in tow, and we decided to have a drink while waiting for our food to go.  Our order -  Small hot and sour soup Canton sampler (ribs, fried shrimp, egg rolls, crab puffs) Pork dumplings Chicken chow mein 2 hard alcohol drinks  Well - the drinks were right - and poured on the heavy side. That accounts for one of the stars. The bartender was a sweetheart, which is the other star.  I can't report on the hot and sour soup. Mom had about two spoons of it, said it was fine, but didn't want anything more. And insisted I take the chicken entree home with me, she had no appetite at all. The sampler. Mostly tasteless and unremarkable. Except the crab puffs. They were memorable because they were so incredibly sweet I couldn't even finish one. The filling seemed to have as much powdered sugar as cream cheese. Not something I'm used to, and not pleasant. Pork dumplings I can't comment on - as we got BBQ sliced pork instead. Sigh. Chicken chow mein - I know it's supposed to be a mild (bland) dish - but they even managed to get the flavor out of the veggies! And something was missing. The chow mein noodles! Seriously? A noodle dish and you forget to include the damn noodles? I had to specifically ask for a plastic spoon for the soup and chopsticks. Too bad I didn't check the packages - would have also asked for hot mustard, sweet and sour sauce, and maybe a suggestion for a decent Chinese restaurant next time I am in the area.  When the Applebee's in the same parking lot is an experience in gourmet flavors in comparison, you know you're doing something wrong. Mom won't be back at that hospital - hopefully no one else I know will either, so I can confidently say I will not be back."}
{"text":"We were hungry Christmas night.  The place was packed so we knew it either had to be good or everyone was just hungry and all other places were closed.  It was delicious!! We were greeted by the \"Big Boss\" (a 10 year old who sat us and told someone to get us water, she was totally in charge) I had the crab angles and my hubby had the chicken egg roll to start. The crab angles were so good and creamy. They were perfectly fried along with the egg roll. I ordered the orange chicken and it was all white meat chicken, no fat. Perfectly cooked. Could have had a little kick as wasn't spicy at all but it was great.  Hubby had the teriyaki chicken and he said it was so good.  So glad we went out and ended up here as we plan on coming back."}
{"text":"We enjoy food from here on a regular basis. Everything is always fresh and delicious. We are fans of their soups, chicken and broccoli, and Singapore rice noodle to name s few (there eggrolls could be better I would pass). The service and friendly staff is outstanding."}
{"text":"What an unexpected treat! Since we were visiting the area, we weren't sure who to ask to find good Chinese food. We tried a different restaurant at the other side of this same parking lot and had average reviews to make about it. The next go-round, we decided to give Canton Dragon a try.....YAY for us! The appetizers were on happy hour prices, quite tasty....but the Orange Chicken was the star of the show for this dinner! Yummy, just the right amount of sweet with a kick. My only concern was my peanut allergy that I warned the waitress about but she failed to keep me from the lettuce wraps until I was a few bites in :( Thankfully, my taste buds are designed to kick out the alarm before an E.R. visit was necessary! And the server was oh-so-sorry for the misstep that it all ended just fine. Will definitely go back to try more half-price yummies during happy hour!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Helpful staff .  Excellent food. Not much around this area that's not burgers and tacos.  Was better than the organic place across the parking lot.  QUICK UPDATE:  So I went back by again (FYI, it was several weeks ago when I first found them, just took me awhile to write the review which I did this morning).  Found myself sort of stranded in the epicurean hell that is anything between Indian School and Raintree for the most part -- disagree -- gimme a list.  So I go in, plop myself down, plug in my stuff and \"Hi Honey, It's You\"  comes from the cute girl with the braces that had taken care of my orders before in the afternoon past.  \"I'm well, thank you.\"  I took myself to the menu, but with one ear open.  These guys actually CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS.  I was at the bar as I didn't want to take up tables in a place that was pretty packed for 6 PM on a Friday in Scottsdale.  The corner of the bar is always the best place to observe.  It wasn't just me that got the \"honey\" treatment.  I was amazed.  Because the whole staff remembered something about the guest that sat down next to me for a giant box of takeout.  My ears piqued as I heard similar interrogatories of \"yes, I remembered your name\".  Bar is fully stocked, Happy Hour is 11-8 PM or something like that on a Friday.  Beers are reasonable in bottles -- domestics $3.99, imports $4.99  and they have a great selection.  The liquor at the bar action is pretty much non-existent -- probably because of the 10 really tasty sounding icecream.    Ended up sitting next to a guy that went to the same grade school as I, got paddled by the same teacher in the same bathroom in the mid to late 70s and was there with his most charming wife -- from Minnesota -- couldn't leave that one alone -- it's impossible to get Minnesotans upset!  Although I didn't say anything about hockey, ice fishing or snow machines!    They were another couple that walked into the \"hey honey\" modality that is this next door to Delia's funhouse of family, food and frivolity.  I had the Calamari Spicy -- nice kick, perfected breaded and fried with this what I'm assuming is a Tomato base, but creamy and tangy and fit perfectly with the small bite of the thinly sliced peppers on the plate.  If you are withing 3 miles of the 101 and Shea and haven't been here yet.  I believe you are missing out!  And not just for the amazing food.  I didn't ask, only made assumptions, but this is  FAMILY business in terms of Staff and certainly a Staff that cares about it's FAMILY -- the customers.  It was like Cheers, but without the drinkers and more comforting for the soul than the items on the menu of which I have yet to try!  Although I grew up in this town and that area was up and coming, I'm more of a Phoenix guy than an overl everaged Real Estate North Scottsdale guy.  THIS IS A PLACE THAT YOU MUST CHECK OUT!"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to the Egg Foo Young since I first tried it, but I no longer recommend it. The patties are smaller and the gravy was thinner and tasted watered down. What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Great chinese cuisine, very clean place, nice employees.  I had scallops and shrimp in spicy garlic sauce and it was perfect...my husband had his favorite plate shrimp fried rice and he said was one of the best he has ever had. God job guys."}
{"text":"Danger this place will poison you.Ordered shrimp dish it was very spicy reason was the shrimp was spoiled they tried to cover the taste with the spices.we all got food poisoning"}
{"text":"Incredibly surprised with how good their food was! My husband ordered the orange chicken which was lightly battered and had a GREAT taste. I ordered their chicken and broccoli which was not breaded and placed in a white sauce. I'm used to brown sauce, but it was GREAT! I would definitely pay the extra 1.00 for their fried rice. It was yummy. Also, both meals were about 9 bucks. If you check in on Yelp, you can get 15% off your bill. The staff is also very friendly."}
{"text":"It was okay, and good to know that carry out and delivery is available close by.  Just not as flavorful as it could have been.  The hot and sour soup, on the other hand was very flavorful...but only served lukewarm."}
{"text":"This place is close to my work and has really good dishes. The staff and owners make this place even better. I cook myself so I usually ask for bits and piece of different dishes to combine myself and these guys have never said no. Great food, great people."}
{"text":"I think I wanted to like this place more because Yelp offered a 15% off the bill, that I didn't get to use anyways. Apparently you have to write the review while in the restaurant, then show it to the management, then they will give you the discount. Talk about pressure. Since Yelp doesn't allow you to post a review, only draft it, I was unable to do this, or use the coupon.   The food was alright, nothing fancy. The egg drop soup was very jelly like, and reminded me of weird school lunch. Not sure if this is normal but i've never had jelly soup before.  The staff was friendly, and I believe its family operated. Would eat there again, but now know I can't use the discount, especially after writing this."}
{"text":"Why all the hate? I used to frequent here for lunch all the time. The prices were cheap and the food was always amazing. Every soup on the menu was good and the service was wonderful. I can't imagine giving this place any less than five stars.  This place is never busy. I think every time I've gone I was like...one of the only people in the restaurant."}
{"text":"It is disappointing when you find a place that has only a few really good dishes and everything else is just, well...OK. And yes, they have a little bar in the back if you need something to make your day a bit better however when the bill comes out do not be shocked that the drinks cost way more than the food...."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst Chinese restaurant in town.  They never get an order correct.  They respond in a rude manner when it is politely brought to their attention.  NEVER GO TO THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"We were in the area and I was skeptical of stopping here because of the low stars. I was in the mood for a dine in chinese lunch so deciced to give it a try. The interior was a lot different than the dated photos on file so now I wish I would have taken a picture of that. The lighting was low and inviting; and the ceiling fans are different, too. The ambiance was quite laid back and divey. Lunch specials start with a soup: egg drop or hot & sour; it was quite a lovely little soup served with a side of wontons and some sauce. But I really fell in love with my green bean lunch special, I chose to add soft noodles for $2 (they were seasoned and thick like udon noodles). You would think that cooking green beans isn't rocket science but you cannot imgine how many places I've gone to that have hard, barely cooked beans and others have have them cooked so long they barely hold onto the fork before the become smooshy and barely edible. It was a very lovely and cozy experience and if in this area again, I will surely stop by without a second thought!"}
{"text":"Good lunch location. We Avoid Sunday as our fav server isn't there. Love their happy hour selections."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in town in my opinion. Love the sweet and sour chicken, the service is always really good, and solid happy hour prices."}
{"text":"Low quality Chinese food. My sugar-loving child found the sweet and sour chicken to be objectionable. The green curry with beef and shrimp was terrible due to a cost-cutting abundance of sauce-stretching corn starch. The beef was very low quality.  We were up charged for wonton soup which was watered down in another cost-cutting move. This is not a good bet for Chinese food in Scottsdale. Please avoid and seek other options on Shea Blvd."}
{"text":"I ordered take out - 2 entrees (happy family and green chicken and shrimp curry) and the two eggs. For nearly $30 I expected a ton of food, but it was pretty standard as far as quantity. There was no rice included (but I think there was supposed to be, hence my 3 stars instead of 4). The food was very good. There are like 9 other Asian restaurants within a mile or so of Canton Dragon (Jade Palace, Cha Da Thai, Ling & Louie's, Akita Sushi, Hiro Sushi, Red House, Bamboo Club, Quik Chinese and Sushi Ko), so not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here and the food was excellent! Service was even better we were checked on many times. Thanks for being open on Christmas :)"}
{"text":"I don't know how anyone wouldn't love this place. They truly have the best happy hour (pretty much all day), great drinks and great food at really cheap prices. The inside has been remodeled tastefully, service is fast and friendly, there really isn't a single thing I don't like. They definitely deserve 5 stars in my book."}
{"text":"Food is consistent but the portions are sort of small for the price. One of my favorite things that is hard to find is the shrimp toast. If you have never tried it, try these they are crispy and delicious. It is the closet I could find to mandarin style Chinese food here in my area. The lemon Chicken is also very good."}
{"text":"Don't let the small location next to a barbershop, dry cleaners, and phone store fool you. Excellent food, great service. Never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Our new favorite asian restaurant! Everything came out nice not like other restaurant i used to go to."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant all time. They have the best Dragon Clam Chowder. I recommend the spicy calamari and lo mein"}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation from a friend and left with an appreciation for the food and service here. We came here for an early dinner, about 6pm. It was about half full at this point. We were greeted and seated right away, by the hostess and another lady (who we learned later was the owner). We picked the Chicken Katsu over fried rice, along with the Sweet and Sour Pork with fried rice. The fried rice was fine, but what made the food stand out were the sauces they used. I could tell that the sweet and sour sauce they used was freshly made there. It had a hint of honey, along with the light sour vinegar taste. Overall it was delcious. The Chicken Katsu had a sharper taste to it that I associate with a good demi-glace sauce I've had at katsu restaurants in Japan. It was nostalgic. I'll most likely upgrade my review to 5 stars once I've tasted more items on their menu, but after this first experience I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is the Chinese food I grew up eating!  Food is great and staff is friendly, what else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Such good food and service  CONSISTENTLY for years. I have referred many people over the years."}
{"text":"Went here with a large group.  Service was great and they even added another table.  Food was mediocre at best.  I had the shrimp and lobster sauce and it was more shrimp and watery something.  There were only 2  bean pods and no other veggies that I could find.  The egg roll was not like anything I have ever tasted.  Greasy and mushy.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Omg the eggdrop soup was delicious!! This place is really great to get your authentic Chinese fix. I recomend hitting up the lunch special to save some money which i believe is from 11am-3:00pm. The music that they play is retro love ballads. Good eats for a quick lunch super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I arrived to pick up my order. I gave them my name and they didn't have the food. The guy picked up another order read the name \"Patrick\" and handed to me. Unfortunately, my name isn't \"Patrick\", or else I would have taken my food and been on my way. I explained that I wasn't \"Patrick\" and gave him my name again. Once again he pushes the food toward me and says \"Patrick\".  I was a bit frustrated and left without my order. The next day I looked at my bank account online. They charged me anyway, even though I never got my food.  Who the hell is \"Patrick\" and why did they keep trying to get rid of his food?"}
{"text":"Great lunch special and great environment! I was definitely impressed with the service. The food wasn't my favorite Chinese food but still good."}
{"text":"Yummy each and every time .. get the shrimp , big and plump and the Sichuan wonton super tasty. Great service."}
{"text":"All I can say was yummy. Food was warm until we got back. crab rangoons where out of this world."}
{"text":"You would never guess that this place would be as awesome as it is from the outside!  Everything is made from scratch.  They offer Chinese as well as Thai choices and all are equally as good.  It's a family run restaurant with the wife Candy as the face of the restaurant and the husband the chef.  The wait staff are all family as well. If you go once it's like you've been there before so welcoming!  I love everything always! My little guy is addicted to lettuce wraps and edamame, I love the Kung pao with extra veggies, hubby like egg foo young and my girls love anything noodle related...all outstanding!  Give this place a try well worth it!"}
{"text":"Chinese food is a very personal taste in determining quality. Canton Dragon, while serving well prepared food, just doesn't fit my palate as well as some other Chinese restaurants. I found the food to be bland (for me)."}
{"text":"I love the food here.  The staff always very friendly and inviting.  Always tastes fresh and food comes to our table in an orderly time fresh and hot.  Been a fan for 10 years."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today. Atmosphere was quiet. Service was happy and helpful. Food was hot and received quickly. I had the shrimp lo mein lunch meal and it was plenty of food for the price. Tasty and will absolutely return. Plus happy hour is 11am-8pm!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? Horrible service. We came in with 13 people and the restaurant was half empty. Plenty of space for the entire party but the owner and manager refused to move either of the tables together. From start to end we were very disappointed. We will not be back and do not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good service and a relaxing time."}
{"text":"Fairly busy even on a weekday night.  Good food.  The green curry is quite spicy, but delicious.  I like that you can get brown rice instead of white rice."}
{"text":"Favorite chinese restaurant!  The vegetables with the entree are always crisp!"}
{"text":"We've been ordering take out from Canton Dragon for years.  My husband went to pick up the order and it wasn't ready and he arrived 10 minutes past the given time.  It was all wrapped up and he couldn't tell if everything was there.  We realized the egg rolls are not in the container and call for a refund.  They never apologize for the mistake and will not credit our credit card.  We will give you a credit the next time you order is what they insist on doing and only for the price of the egg rolls.  Meanwhile we have a person with no dinner and less than $3. credit on our next order.  We won't be going back as their treatment of a long standing customer is unacceptable."}
{"text":"This is a go to for Chinese fusion take out for our family. We found this to be the best we could find in the Scottsdale area for a family of discerning foodies. We eat here at least once per month. Great service and great food and this local family owned operation. Everything is fresh and consistently good. Lettuce wraps, Singapore rice noodles, curries, and the soups are always spot on."}
{"text":"I've seen this place in this strip mall several times and was always too scared to try it.  My fiance and I walked in one day and were surprised to see how much bigger (and nicer) it is on the inside.  You would NEVER know by just looking at it from the street.   The service is kind, friendly, and speedy.  We have had several dishes that were suitable for a little unassuming place like this.  We always order 'special' dishes of our own creation with meats and chinese vegetables and whatever sauce we feel like that day and they are more than accommodating.  Their dishes are much better than the appetizers.  Not a huge fan of their fried rice either, but I am spoiled by LA Chinese food.  For here, and especially in N. Scottsdale it's not too shabby."}
{"text":"I actually enjoy the food at this place. I don't really understand the 3 star overall review. I will say as an iced tea lover it's hit or miss on the taste of the black tea. I would recommend their fried rice is good as well as the lo mein. They have very generous portions, I would order one entrée for 2 people and share a side and maybe one of their tasty little appetizers. It's everything you can expect from a tiny little hole in the wall Chinese food restaurant."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service!!! This restaurant is across the street from the cancer center where my brother is undergoing treatment & the hostess did NOT want to seat us because it was getting close to closing time 8:45 and they close at 9:30. The little Chinese girl that didn't want us to sit and enjoy our meal (out of my brothers face) told me her name was Phoebe. The most rude inconsiderate person I've ever met in MY LIFE!!"}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly and nice however the eggplant and tofu are watery and supremely gross. I would go elsewhere if you want any kind of vegetable."}
{"text":"We started out with Sizzling Rice soup. It was outstanding. We ordered Orange Chicken, Shrimp Egg Foo Young and Combo Fried Rice. It was all exceptional. Your perfect neighborhood Chinese restaurant. We will certainly go back. Prices were very reasonable and the portions were large. We brought food home from what we ordered.  If you looking for a nice, clean, friendly family Chinese restaurant you have found the place!!!"}
{"text":"Discovered this gem on my peds rotation. Usually have 45 minutes for my lunch and cannot be late! This place is super speedy. Between being seated and walking out the door- done in 30 min, BOOM!  The lunch specials are definitely the best deal. Most food and variety for the best dollars spent.  They have all of your favorite Chinese classics. Casual. Dependable."}
{"text":"Very rude. Good food but I thought my wife left cash on the table. So I did not put a tip on the receipt. The waitress chased me outside and demanded a tip rudely. So I gave her $2 only. I'm a family of 8 that will never go back. This was about 2 weeks ago."}
