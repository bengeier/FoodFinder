{"text":"Great lunch spot! The menu is mostly sandwiches, salads, wine, & craft beer. The employees are really friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Been here about a dozen times and have only had one regular menu item because the specials each day are phenomenal."}
{"text":"This place has decent sandwiches, and some dry goods. I think they are going to expand their inventory as it gets busier. The owners are super chill, very open to suggestions and just want to run a cool shop. Best is they have single IPA beers. It is a money spot to swing by on your bike and grab a cold one for the ride home."}
{"text":"NoDa Bodega is definitely one of the gems of NoDa I love telling people about. The Italian stallion is ridiculously good. I wish I didn't eat it as fast as I do so I could prolong enjoyment!! Always a fun spot to go to for breakfast, lunch, dinner or a beer."}
{"text":"Easily the best sandwiches in Charlotte! It is a shame they won't let you create your own sandwich anymore at the new location they just lost a customer."}
{"text":"Great sandwich.  Turkey and avocado and pineapple salsa"}
{"text":"What a great and CHARMING place. I have been here on several occasions and every time the service and food were great! A MUST GO in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place is consistently good which seems easy to do but so many places start off good but then it's hit or miss - no this place - Reuben, stallion, green goddess (when they have the special) and their salads are great - go to place in noda"}
{"text":"The Bodega is a sandwich shop / gourmet specialty store ... and they have a classy selection of beer (and maybe wine, too?).  It's what I had HOPED the Salvador Deli would be.   This Bodega JUST opened.   It's strangely located, finding itself in the middle of a residential neighborhood.  They are clearly just starting to build up their inventory, but you can already tell they have great taste in gourmet foods.    The owners are very friendly, and they seem to be well on their way to building a cute little shop.  I got a sandwich there... I *think* it was called \"Italian Stallion\".  It was Fantastic."}
{"text":"There are no veg option listed but they will accommodate. I order a hoagie with hummus, spinach, peppers, olives etc and a bowl of soup. Rad"}
{"text":"This place has a great sense of nostalgia to go with great food!  My friend and I shared 2 sandwiches  (the ham & cheese and the rueben).  Unbelievably good, fresh, with homemade ingredients!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I live right around the corner and don't know why it's taken me this long to stop in! I got the daily special which was called \"the big tastee\" and it was AMAZING! The deviled eggs are awesome as well! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Read the review and decide to go. Limited off street parking but no cause for concern; plenty of street parking available in the Noda neighborhood where this  is located in Charlotte. The blue house on the corner turned restaurant was very clean inside, had nice music playing, and a high food score posted on the wall. The vey helpful friendly staff had good advice on choosing a sandwich and made changes to a sandwich for us without making faces.  Sandwiches and Greek Salad ordered and we sat waiting at a 1950 style Formica kitchen table and chair set to eat! Sandwiches arrived wrapped in brown paper complete with a pickle spear on the side, so so so delicious! Greek Salad was beautifully arranged lettuce tomatoes  olives arti hearts and hummus on crustini bread ! Would I go back...YES! If you are nearby stop in for a bite!"}
{"text":"Such a yummy experience! Great selection of drinks and a phenomenal staff. Can't wait to come back again and again."}
{"text":"The Bodega is this super cute convenience store /sandwich shop/ deli /  beer and wine store, tucked a bit back from N. Davidson in a residential area. I actually like the quirky location -- not only is it slightly less of a walk for me, its really casual and homey and the employees are really friendly.   They have daily specials for their sandwiches, which are usually really interesting combinations of fresh meats and gourmet touches.  You can also build your own sandwich, of course, and they're really open to suggestions for things to add to the menu. Their selection of chips and snacks is also killer, and don't forget to ask for a pickle with your food! So juicy."}
{"text":"I send people here every time someone asks where to go for lunch. I want bodega right now."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast!  Service was quick and folks were very friendly!  New location is really  convenient.  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Staff was very helpful.  They made a special club sandwich that was delicious. I will go back."}
{"text":"Within walking distance of Noda, great sandwich, beer and wine selection and the people working there couldn't be better.  They're knowledgable and very helpful. Love it here and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a little neighborhood love.  Support our local businesses"}
{"text":"Literally everything I've had here is perfect. They have two changing daily specials, which I always try to jump on. The reuben is everything you'd want from a reuben, even though it's nontraditional, you'll never want your basic reuben again. Plus they have a bunch of stuff you can take home and munch on, like their homemade killer pimento cheese."}
{"text":"Nice vibe inside, fair prices, friendly staff. The avocado toast was delicious. Great breakfast or lunch spot."}
{"text":"Not only is no NoDa Bodega an amazing place to eat and meet up with your friends, but it is also an amazing choice for catering your wedding!   My wife and I were planning a backyard wedding at our home in NoDa and explored many options from food trucks to your more conventional catering companies who only specialize in that market. We had so many options but none of them made us feel as comfortable as Brian and Lisa did when we found out they offered catering.   They were amazing to work with, walking us through all of our options and were extremely flexible with how the menu would appear. Brian came to the table (pun intended) with beautiful suggestions based on our budget and Lisa was there every step of the way with all of the details we would have never thought of for our specific needs. Let me just tell you, we had more compliments on the food at our wedding than anything else! Our menu consisted of butternut squash soup with pumpkin seeds, sweet tea brined chicken, stuffed pork loin, potatoes au gratin, bacon brussels sprouts, and they helped us create two specialty drinks to be served to our guests. Our wedding was in November and it was the perfect menu for a beautiful fall evening.   They were more than just a catering service, they provided recommendations on flowers, tableware, furniture, servingware, and even photographers, bands, and DJs. Brian and Lisa have a wealth of knowledge when it comes to finding vendors and solutions for some of the nuances of your event, as they have been active in this industry for years.    Above everything else, they were great friends and people to lean on when they could tell we were getting a little stressed out as the days counted down to the big day. We live right around the corner from Bodega, and while they were always welcoming to us, when I see them now it feels like family. I'm sure I am leaving out many details that made this such a perfect day and experience that my wife and I will cherish forever, but all I can tell you is choosing Noda Bodega as our catering was the best choice we could have ever made."}
{"text":"BEST SANDWICHES ON THE EASTERN SEABOARD.  PERIOD.  I love to either call in a sandwich to go... or just eat it there on the comfy couch.  This place is literally as good as it gets.  They are soooo creative with all of their combinations, so do yourself a favor and try them out.  I promise you will be impressed :)"}
{"text":"The breakfast was delicious... I tried the pimento cheese, egg, and meat breakfast biscuit... 5 start biscuit!"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches in town in my opinion. Which is saying a lot because I'm usually very critical of sandwiches given how much I love them. The only thing about The Bodega that I find to be a hassle is how slow they are at making sandwiches. Granted I've only been here twice (and will certainly be back) but each time it has been super-slow. I'm not usually one to complain about this but for some reason I can never understand what is actually happening behind the counter that is slowing things down so much. Note however that I still gave this place five stars! The sandwiches are one of those things you say are \"worth the wait\" believe it or not!  Both experiences I've had so far have resulted in awesomely delicious sandwiches that I'm not sure I'd be able to nail if I attempted to make them at home. That's one of the things great about The Bodega. The sandwiches I've had here are the kind I wouldn't make at home and for that, it is certainly worth the trip. The ingredients are super-fresh and each sandwich I've had were super-flavorful with great sauces and combination of ingredients.  If you're looking for one of the better sandwiches in town and aren't in a rush to get in and out, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Living in NoDa since 2005, I've always said the one place our hood sorely lacked was a great deli. I no longer say that and must find something else to bitch about.  You should try ANYTHING ON THE MENU."}
{"text":"For some folks from the \"big\" cities this has got to feel like going home. The entire mix of food, drink, surroundings and patrons is so wonderfully eclectic and is proof positive that Charlotte & her \"Noda\" neighborhood have got a lot. Try anything and you won't be disappointed BUT definitely get any sandwich that has the jalapeno bacon. Sooo good."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and had the caprese panini. It was very good. Friend had a turkey sandwich which he also enjoyed and it was pretty big. Place is cute and clean and the staff was very friendly. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The Bodega is a great addition to NoDa. Perfect place for a kick ass sandwich and fresh salad. You can also buy beer to go here too. They have a variety of house sandwiches and salads as well as awesome daily specials like the Rasta Mon, and G-Man's G-Wich. The ingredients are always fresh and the dressings and sauces are made in house as well as the egg and chicken salads.  Seating is limited so 95% of orders are to go. They have a variety of juices, kombucha, sodas, and even popsicles and such for those super hot days. They also sell random last minute things for party purposes such as toilet paper, cigarettes, white owls, tylenol, etc.   Beers! Man they have a great selection of local and regional beers. The only problem is you can't drink alcohol on site which would make this place way bad ass. Bodega has been a staple in NoDa for a solid 2 years or so and now they are making the move up the street to 36th where they are expanding, going to have tons more options for seating including an outdoor patio, and they will be serving alcohol on draft!"}
{"text":"I eat here almost every day and its always delicious!  My favorites are the caprese, tuna melt, Italian stallion, and the Reuben!!!  The food is always fresh and the service is always friendly!  They even recently started doing soups!!!!"}
{"text":"After ordering 3 things they were out of, I ordered the Tuna melt.  They are out of ciabatta bread  - of course - fine then, I'll have it on a baguette. After waiting 25 minutes I get my \"melt\".  The cheese isn't melted and they left off the lettuce and tomato. This does not make me want to come back........"}
{"text":"If I wouldn't balloon out to 1,000 pounds I would quit doing groceries and eat at the Bodega for breakfast lunch and dinner every single day.  Yes. Every single day."}
{"text":"HOLY CRAP, this place is heaven.  First discovered The Bodega when we moved to Charlotte from NJ when it was still located on a residential street in NoDa.  I can't lie, I preferred that location so much more because it was just so quaint.  Even though it's moved to a slightly sketchier location down the road, I'll still give it 5 stars because it's THAT good.  These sandwiches are mother f'ing incredible.  They usually have 5-8 standards which are all great, but then they'll have specials which are always great too.  I think my favorite would be the bodega reuben- those mustard seeds in that homemade slaw?!  Are you kidding?!  Incredible.  Their homemade sides in the case are excellent too- i personally recommend the greek pasta salad and hummus (yummus).  Plus they have a great beer selection in the fridge.  I know they changed locations so they could serve alcohol/obtain a liquor license so I get why they moved, but I still kind of miss the nostalgia of the old place.  Doesn't matter though, as long as this place is still serving up their top notch sammies, they'll always get 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"I think they're professional chefs.  For a sandwich they really pack a punch with interesting flavors and a good size.  This place is off the main drag so it's really a hidden gem.  They also keep up a great selection of beer and wine.  Although their staples are unbeatable, I like that they have diverse specials every day in case I want to mix it up. I can't wait for their restaurant to open."}
{"text":"I tried this place today for the first time after Facebook stalking.  Boy was I pleased. I tried today's special \"Super G\" absolutely delicious.  The bread was warm and toasty on the outside and nice and soft in the inside.  It wasn't packed or a long wait.  I enjoyed sitting there eating my sandwich and looking at all the different drinks. I can't wait to try the Friday special....something roast beef with none other than BACON. yum."}
{"text":"After placing the order the lady told us she will bring out our meal. We waited about 20 minutes, odd because there was only one guy before us at the shop. She ended up calling us to get the meal; by that time the sandwiches were cold.   The taste was good, I just wish it wasn't cold. Not fond of cold toasted bread.   I will try again, maybe this was just a mistake and my bad luck."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite and drink. They really know how to make delicious sandwiches. I got the ham & cheese along with the chicken melt. Both were great, but looking forward to trying their specials next visit."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here is delicious. Great sandwich, amazing potluck menu and great service!  You can always find something on the menu that makes your mouth drool."}
{"text":"Best sandwich ever! I went there for the first time today, specialty sandwiches are the bomb."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of The Bodega. We work right around the corner so it's convenient and SO delicious. The tuna melt with Pimento is off da chain and today I had the Gmans Gwich for the first time and it may just be the best sandwich i've ever had. My favorite deli in Charlotte, for sure!"}
{"text":"It's kind of weird that it took the bodega to move for the wife and I to actually stop in for a sandwich. We had stopped in a few times before but only to buy a few supplies that we needed. Anyway, it's great that they have moved and essentially expanding into a larger space. Also the fact that they moved into the previously abandoned retail place on 36th street bodes well for other businesses to move into the adjacent spaces.  I think that they have expanded the menu a little and it may still be a work in progress. Either way, I love me a good sandwich and I chose the shrimp po' boy and the wife got a veggie sandwich this go around. The veggies in the wife's sandwich were fresh and flavorful, a really good combo. My po' boy was overflowing with shrimp and they were pipping hot. Flavor was good as well, and my only gripe would be the bread could have been better and a true crusty baguette would have been ideal and more authentic. I am a self confessed bread snob and firmly believe that the bread makes or breaks a sandwich. Ultimately, my love of all things sandwich will have me returning here often."}
{"text":"Sure. The Bodega may not be on the main strip alongside the rest of the NoDa greats, but this neighborhood gem packs a walloping punch for those craving local biz feel, love, product, and aesthetic. The simple and understated.....perhaps reonvated \"house,\" takes shape as a cafe/deli/oddly laid out diamond in the rough. Thrilled to check it out after catching wind of the sandwich special of the day.   We walked up and ordered the caprese sandwich and the Mr. G...or Super G...something like that. Only drawback from this visit was attention from the staff. Not a huge deal, but it was a little difficult to get a word out of them, or even get them to pay attention to the fact we were trying to order.   The caprese was perfect. Loved the bread it was on and the mozz, basil, and balsamic were top notch. Nice touch with the tomato spread, too. The sandwich I ordered was just ridiculous. London broil, jalapeno bacon, balsamic reduction and a few other nice accoutrement to enhance texture. Needless to say, it was a mammoth sandwich. Check out my photo. Only downside was when it was all gone, haha.   I'm very much looking forward to heading back to The Bodega. Great sandwiches and selection of other items, too. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood sandwich place and store. Staff are very friendly, the food is well prepared, and always tasty. I would've gave them five stars if they were open later at night, not a big fan of their 8 o'clock closing time. It seems like every time we get there it's right at closing time. Would bee a great neighborhood place to stop and have a drink and a snack during the evening hours. If only they stayed open longer."}
{"text":"Highly recommended! The sandwiches are amazing!   I had the Ruben and the meat was pilled high And it was so delicious. Walk in and order or call on the phone and pick up. It takes a minute for them to make them but it's definitely worth it. Oh the grilled cheese is awesome too."}
{"text":"So you want a delicious sammich, eh? And you would like to not have to fight for parking? But you are out in NoDa.  Allow me to recommend The Bodega. So tasty. So convenient. So grilled cheese & Italian meats-y.  I have had the delight of trying both a grilled cheese special with a Mediterranean twist and the Son of a Stallion. Both were amazing. The bread is crisp but not dry and all of the deli meats were super fresh. Add to that the fact that the owners are down to earth and the fact that they stock some pretty killer chips, drinks and beers, and you have the recipe for win.   Oh and did i mention it's in NoDa but it has parking?!  I did?  Good."}
{"text":"Just got the tuna melt for lunch... Its amazeeeeee!"}
{"text":"I was in NODA looking for a simple lunch. Bodega was a good choice. I decided between a roast chicken salad sandwich, a turkey Reuben, and a Cuban.  I went with the Cuban. It was very good. It was served on grilled and pressed  baguette, which I liked, and included jalapeño as an unexpected ingredient. Hard to beat for $8. The woman behind the counter, I think the owner, seemed very nice as well, talking to all of the customers. This shop is not marked very well from the street. At least that's my excuse for missing it the first time by. But it's worth finding. Recommended."}
{"text":"Although I had driven past NODA Bodega (NDB) when it was at its previous location on 35th St., I never saw any reason to dine here.  Not that I had anything against the place, I just didn't know what they had to offer.  However, at the recommendation of some buddies that live in NODA, I decided to see what the fuss was all about.  Here's all the Info you need about NODA Bodega...  Parking:  One of the most appealing and probably underrated aspects of NODA Bodega is that it has its own parking lot!  I know this might not sound like a big deal, but if you live or go out in the NODA area, you know how crucial this is.  Don't get me wrong, I love to Uber, ride-share, walk and bike as much as the next person, however sometimes you just want to drive up to a spot, park, get out of your car and walk in.  You can do that here at NODA Bodega.    Food:  I've only been here a few times, so I'm, not super well-versed on the menu just yet, but I can vouch for breakfast, particularly the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich.  It was cooked to gooey, morning perfection (see pics).  Tater-tots are good.  They are cooked fresh to order and are served crisp and piping hot.  Don't forget about the Grits.  I'd heard a lot about the grits here and can def vouch for their legitimacy.  Served hot and cheesy you simply can't go wrong with the grits.    Service/Ambiance:  Service is super-friendly.  I've never had any issues with my order.  Although sometimes it can take some time for your food to be served, its usually never super long (thats what SHE SAID -  HAHA!).   Everyone I've interacted with there has been super chill yet professional - which is exactly what I'm looking for.  Aside from the service, I really love the custom art they have on sale/display.  The artwork is always captivating and usually represents the city in some unique way.       After now having been to NODA Bodega twice, my vision is clear, I see exactly what everyone's been clamoring about...great sandwiches, local beers on draft, great service, and an establishment in NODA that actually has its own parking lot, how can you go wrong?!?"}
{"text":"Difficult to choose between great sandwiches, wraps, salads, and daily Facebook specials.  Friendly people.  I know that this family-owned small business will appreciate your patronage.  You won't be disappointed here."}
{"text":"We were looking to try someplace new/local and the NODA Bodega was the perfect spot. A very inviting atmosphere welcomes you from the start.  The menu is not overwhelming. My wife had the Greek salad and it was enough for two. The humus was a nice surprise. I had The Godfather. It was filling but not heavy. The NoDa Bodega will definitely being seeing us again."}
{"text":"I had the down south grilled cheese.  The pimento cheese mixed with Chipotle was awesome.  Really good flavor and a great place for lunch."}
{"text":"This place has never let me down. Their specials are always super tasty and they update their social media frequently enough for you to know what they are every day. The bulgogi sandwich, though a feature, is LIFE. Parking is convenient, staff is always super friendly, and choices are plentiful. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Local, small grocery store with a deli counter.  Due to local laws consumption of alcohol on the premises is prohibited (zoned residential).  That's too bad 'cause they're similar to Common Market which rocks it out.  I would rank then as good with lots of headroom to become great.  Plan on 10 minutes for them to make your sandwich, even when not busy.  A great concept in a growing area.  If I lived nearby it would be a place I'd hang out.  Reasonable prices and credit cards accepted."}
{"text":"The 3 star is because of service. The food is great! I have been to the bodega so many times at the old location and at the new location. Every time the wait is forever even when you call in. Today I called in an a Greek salad at 1:03pm. I was told it would be ready in 10 min which is usually what they say. 25 min later I finally get my order and that was because I said hey is that my order sitting right there? I don't know if maybe a better system would help but this time I almost left without my order. There was a staff member tagging inventory and maybe with several people waiting for orders this wasn't the best use of time. There never seems to be a sense of urgency here. If the service was better I would come more often. Be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast. Pricey though. $13 for bacon egg n cheese on bagel with tots and a Vitamin Water."}
{"text":"My husband and I love The Bodega. The owners are awesome as well as the rest of the staff. The food there is always consistently delish (we love the caprese sandwich) and they have a great selection of natural snack items. And being able to walk there is a bonus because we love to support local business. Try it- you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"This is a great sandwich joint. The ham and cheese, turkey Ruben, and couscous salad were amazing. So were the deviled eggs!! Everything was so fresh!! Worth the trip!!"}
{"text":"I love to see a couple of folks take the initiative and turn something that was a dilapidated eye sore into the next neighborhood staple.  what used to be the best place to buy a possibly used comb, some nylons, and a five year old can of spam has become my favorite place to grab a sandwich.  i am starting to work my way through the regular menu and can testify that they caprese and \"ham and cheese\" are insanely delicious.  i say \"ham and cheese\" because it is actually proscuitto and fresh mozzarella.  if you \"like\" the noda bodega on the faceyspace, you get a pic of their daily special popping up in your feed to make you hungry (get it, feed, hungry?).  their beer selection is small, but nice with plenty of craft and microbrews in there (even a gluten free option or two).  their wine selection is inexpensive and tasty.  they also stock fun non-alcoholic beverage accompanyment.  and as the summer starts to heat up, i am sure they will have trouble keeping their ice cream freezer full.  ben, jerry, bryer, snicker, all sorts of frozen treats.  i will definitely be dropping by on a regular basis..."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with the bodega's wide selection of beverages, especially anything offered by Purity. But the real deal is their food. The breakfast menu is your instant pick-me-up, especially the avocado toast with it's cilantro/lime/cashew spread. You can also go with the traditional breakfast and sub toast for an enormous biscuit that'll put you in an instant food coma. While you're there, grab a cup of Pure Intentions coffee to start your morning. NoDa Bodega is a great no-frills, deli-esque spot- do it."}
{"text":"This place is soooo good! They have a great menu and they always have daily special sandwiches which are almost always the way to go! They have a really great breakfast menu too and they open early. Only reason why I'm giving 4 stars versus 5 is because it takes a little bit of time for the food to get out compared to what you'd expect from a deli. Nothing crazy but if you're in a hurry it's probably not ideal."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once, and I'm already in love.  The Italian Stallion is quite possibly the best sandwich I've ever had the pleasure of ingesting.  Try it.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent tasty sandwiches. I had the Bodega Rueben and it was life changing. YumMz! Thoughtful ingredients and combinations.  I haven't even tried the updated menu they had in the works but I will certainly be back. Really nice people from my experience. Prices may vary as this was 7ish months ago."}
{"text":"Yummy! I got the Ruben and it is delicious! Turkey instead of corned beef and awesome kraut! Customer service is great. This is an awesome sandwich place in NoDa! Disappointed that I haven't tried these guys sooner. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches for lunch. Quick and friendly service. You can always taste it when people love the food they make. Ingredients chosen and prepared with purpose to delight."}
{"text":"Why I failed to take a picture of my Cuban here is beyond me. Excelleeeenttttt sandwich. I was a first timer to the Bodega, and it was WAY bigger inside than I anticipated, which is a plus. Decent size bar and several tables inside. The price for food matched the quality in my opinion (which was amazing), but the beers on draft were a bit pricey (oh how it hurts my feelings to pay 6 bucks for a pint when the same 6 pack is in the cooler for 10 or 11 bucks...le sigh.)  I will absolutely come back here for a meal and a beer before a night out...or a day out...but I definitely wont be doing any serious drinking here due to prices. If they have a draft special night I'm all over it though. Good vibes. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"NoDa Bodega is one of my go-to lunch spots in the neighborhood. They're a short walk or very quick drive off of Davidson over on 36th near the Plaza. The new(ish) space is great. It's in an old strip mall which is vacant aside from this establishment. Their sign isn't super noticeable so you need to look hard for the banner above the door. The interior has a good amount of seating with sixish beers on draft, coolers with refreshments, and shelves holding wine, chips, and other random household supplies like toilet paper.   I have yet to have a sandwich that I didn't like. I usually get one of the daily specials and my wife goes for the caprese. The deviled eggs are a nice side as well. They have grilled options and cold options. I'm not sure who designs the sandwich ingredient combinations but I've always been impressed with the flavor. One time I got a crab cake banh mi that was to die for. I'm not even sure how it was only $10 with the amount of crab on the sandwich.   They've started serving breakfast as well. I've gotten the southern biscuit breakfast sandwich with a runny egg and jalapeño bacon. Needless to say it was great. The avocado toast is very good as well.   I'll keep coming back time and time again to try their new flavors and explore the breakfast menu."}
{"text":"I have followed their Instagram page for a while before I came to eat here, but I finally found a late lunch spot that is amazing. They have awesome daily specials and I had the Club Krystal and it was amazing, especially on the baguette that it was served on. Not to mention, the daily special names are Charlotte related and they're quite unique. They sell an wide variety of lunch add ons like Zappa's chips and kettle chips of many varieties.   The service here is absolutely astounding. The young man and lady manning the front counter helped me with ordering and they were so helpful to call my phone for me and help me find it because I dropped it in my car. Definitely will continue to eat here :)"}
{"text":"Phenominal food, down the tiniest detail. Selection of drinks is always changing, and the music is well chosen for the atmosphere. A solid choice for a summer lunch."}
{"text":"This is the spot to go for breakfast or lunch in NoDa (and worth traveling to NoDa for).  Their plates and sandwiches are packed with flavor and available at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Was my first time to the 36th St. location, and it was... fine. Left wanting more. Italian sandwich was average, took 15 minutes to prepare, and wine/beer selection was limited and surprisingly cliche. Good location, and in time, I'm sure it will do very well, but pretty underwhelming trip. Felt like it was trying to be cooler than it actually was. Lacked culture, and food was subpar."}
{"text":"Walking into this place, it instantly took me back to some of the corner stores that used to be in my old neighborhoods while growing up in new jersey. When you enter, you're greeted by a large board with the specials and a deli case. There's also a counter bar where you can pull up a seat and eat.  There are also racks stacked with your essentials. Ya know candy, chips, and toilet paper. At the edge of the store, there's a large refrigerated case stocked with craft beers, some domestic favorites, and bottles of wine. They also have craft beers on tap  In case, you have trouble making a decision while in-store, be sure to check their FB page beforehand! They post/share their daily specials. They also serve breakfast pretty much all day on Sundays so you can pop in for a hearty breakfast sandwich during the afternoon should your booze-soaked Saturday night cause you to sleep in.  I got to quickly chat with the owner and she was very sweet and personally recommended the brisket tacos (of which I ordered). I placed my to-go order for the tacos and a \"that next level rasta\" sandwich which were both ready quite quickly. The recipient of the rasta sandwich gave it very high praises. Personally, I found the brisket in the tacos a little tough but still all right, overall. I see myself frequenting the bodega quite a bit in the future!"}
{"text":"The bodega has a wide selection of basic and artisan sandwiches. They do it right. Sandwiches may seems simple, but the NoDa bodega has perfected most of their sandwiches. At first it was a little hard for me to get used to a sandwich that wasn't a sub, so is was just getting the peanut butter and jelly. Don't get the peanut butter and jelly. It will give you the wrong impression. The Italian station is my favorite. If you like pizza you'll like this. It doesn't taste like pizza but it has the same heavy Italian influence some pizza tries to create. It is really good. The sandwiches come out fast. Really great place overall. Don't overlook this place. It's a real gem."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and awesome atmosphere. The staff was friendly and efficient. I will come back. Really loved it."}
{"text":"This is the perfect spot for a quick and delicious lunch or breakfast. They have many local beers on tap as well which is awesome. We tried two sandwiches off the menu, they were both delicious. We want to go back and try the breakfast next time as the menu for that looked amazing too."}
{"text":"So my experience started simply with the ordering process.  I came in 100% certain I was going to get their Italian Stallion sandwich, however that changed as soon as I read sandwich special board.  I ordered their Muenster Mash sandwich and it was fantastic.  It is actually really hard to find a place that does sandwiches really well and The Bodega certainly does.  I will be back to try more or their menus soon."}
{"text":"I need you to stop reading this Yelp page and just go get a sandwich and/or a salad from Bodega NOW. I'm typing this review at 10:30 PM on a Thursday and am salivating at the thought of their food. Just... do it. Seriously. Bodega. Do it."}
{"text":"So happy I found this place! Everything about NoDa Bodega is really cool. Their food is so flavorful and fresh and I love the really cool build your own Bloody Mary bar.  They offer so many different varieties of food and cater towards any diet. The staff also is very friendly. Love this place and telling all my friends about it!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm, The Bodega. What a great Yelp find! And how I wish this place had been around before I moved away a few years ago!  Great, friendly staff that is dedicated to serving up high quality sandwiches in a relaxing, but very simple atmosphere.  We plopped down on a couch and ate off the coffee table.   I had the Italian Stallion and my guest had  the ham and cheese.  Outstanding flavors in both.  The Bodega will be a definite stop next time I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are GREAT with exceptional ingredients. I am pretty much a beef eater, so that's the only reason why I kept it to four stars- they tend to be chicken and turkey heavy. If they had the G-man G-wich everyday, I would give them 6 stars. It's a special not to be missed!"}
{"text":"A Unique shop with Great Food.    My wife and I have been here twice and both times have enjoyed our sandwiches.  (for some reason I always seem to like my wife's sandwich more than mine???)  This venue was an old house, converted to a small store with a deli counter. The sandwiches are made in a sort of panini style and are served hot.  The flavors are always bold and well combined.   The food prep is a teensy bit slow, but I think it's part of the charm.  There isn't a ton of seating, but I've never been when it was packed, so it seems like a non issue.  Most people seem to do take-out.  The have a great beer selection (bottles and cans) to have with your sandwiches."}
{"text":"I love this neighborhood spot! Great place for a lunch for one or to pick up a bite to go. Fresh ingredients, friendly service, dope music and a killer wine/beer selection. Rad music selection and comfy seating for a small amount of people makes it hard to leave. Eat the Charlie Tuna Melt - it's a fave!"}
{"text":"This is my go to sandwhich shop. Uniquely crafted sandwhiches, with interesting sauces, perfect ratio of ingredients, and good bread.  Really enjoy the low key environment of the shop/restaurant as well."}
{"text":"As far as sandwich bodegas go, Noda Bodega is the best in the neighborhood.  I was never in their previous location, but their current one is pretty great.  Here's what's pretty cool about Noda Bodega:  1. Sandwiches.  Oh the Sandwiches.  They are so delicious!  You can go boring and just get what you want, but I highly recommend ordering one of their creations off of the menu.  I'm recently digging the turkey reuben with Turkey and homemade vinegar-based slaw toasted on delicious bread.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it...  2. Specials.  Noda Bodega rotates their sandwich specials and posts them on Facebook in case you're thinking about wondering in to try something new.  They also have weekly specials on the board.  3. Small but great selection.  There isn't a huge drink selection, but what they have is pretty darn good.  Their chip selection is always stocked with really cool flavors.  4. It's clean and there's a place to sit.  I know this sounds silly, but I'm a little judgey when it comes to restaurants and cleanliness.  They have lots of mis-matched old furniture to contribute to the casual vibe, but it's not gross.  Overall, great place to grab a sandwich and a bevvie!"}
{"text":"Bookmarked? Okay, it had been awhile - they actually moved to a new location! Can't really compare, but this space seems to suit them to a T!  Sprecher and Dr. Browns sodas - great selection of bottled beers - and... a few well selected draught beers!   The main draw here are the sandwiches - got to try the Italian Stallion and the Reuben - both solid, tasty selections- high quality pressed \"panini\" style sammies. The Reuben had an amazing slaw on it!  Looks like they have breakfast! Definitely need to go back!!!"}
{"text":"I always used to get the tuna melt which is really good. However, lately, I have been letting the staff make my mind up with the daily specials and they have always been spot on. There are not many people working when I go so I always call in my order and pick it up. I just found out recently by chance that they post their daily specials on facebook so you know exactly what they have."}
{"text":"What a quaint little old house turned into small deli/store.  Came on this in a super cute neighborhood in the NoDa after a search for lunch.  We were still early for lunch rush, about 11:30a so parking was not an issue. If you go during super busy times drive around for street parking.  We had three in our party and after we ordered the food was ready in about 10 minutes. 1) The Italian stallion sandwich. High quality meats that were heated with great authentic Italian sub flavors. Recommended!!!! 2) The club sandwich. The bread was toasted and fresh with the same high quality sliced to order meats.  We even made an ingredient change on this due to dietary restrictions and the staff was super accommodating.  Delicious !!!!! 3) The Greek salad. OH MY FLAVORS. This was amazing. So so so fresh. Loaded with tomatoes, olives, feta, artichoke hearts. The dressing was a really tangy mustardy vinaigrette and complemented the salad perfectly.  We all agreed that we would come back here again when in the area.  Health score was 98 if you look for that.  Store was really clean.  Staff was so friendly and chill.  This made our Saturday trip to Charlotte that much better. Thanks!!!!"}
{"text":"My regular weekend sandwich stop. Love the rotating specials although the afternoon delight is my favorite. Love the food and the service."}
{"text":"Amazing deff a hidden gem food was phenomenal and great atmosphere. Perfect place for lunch."}
{"text":"I got the the pimento cheese sandwich on wheat with a fried egg and jalapeño bacon. I went on a Sunday and it's was crowded had to wait 20-30 minutes and by 12 some things are the menu where sold out so get there early on Sunday if you want certain things but other than that the girl taking our order was good and answered all of our questions. They where looking to hire more help, which they needed but love this place will be going back"}
{"text":"Yeah, I knew this was going to be good. Coolers of strange looking and unusual drinks. Racks of potato chips and such from far away. And two boards of specials, one of which they were out of as I got up to the register. I like that - it means that it's fresh.  I opted for a can of Dr. Browns, a bag of Route 11 chips and a sandwich they call \"Afternoon Delight\" which was a spiced turkey with cheese and avocado and tomato in a panini press. It was delicious. Super filling and tasty.  Totally would return here to Noda Bodega. Yum!"}
{"text":"love love this spot!! My Rueben was amazing. Love the special touch of stainless steel wrapped in a quality napkin. love, love, love the special touch!!"}
{"text":"They do have gluten free bread if you ask! We had the avocado toast with egg and the breakfast BLT, which was amazing"}
{"text":"Their breakfast is amazing!  Their bagel with lox, capers & schmear made me miss my Yankee roots but they also somehow do livermush as if they were Paula Dean herself.   Their Bloody Mary bar can't be beat and the staff have always been Uber friendly."}
{"text":"Still love the Bodega. Now that I've been a few times I can add that I've yet to eat anything I didn't like. The Hanoi Rocks sandwich is the bomb! They have a static menu while simultaneously rotating special sandwiches in and out...and they're ALL good! I would give 5 stars if the young lady at the cash register even slightly acted like she wanted our business. Otherwise a phenomenal place for great sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love their new spot! While I liked their old, cozy store tucked away in Noda, this move was the right one if only for the fact we can all consume beer on premise now!! They have a great local draft selection and fun bar seating. There's even a TV for sports fans that want to go out but can't tear themselves away from the big game.   Ample and easy parking!   I stopped in for a late lunch. Their Bodega Salad with a scoop of smoked chicken salad is my usual go-to but their sandwiches are also amazing. I can't wait to try them out for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. I got the daily special and the hubs got the Reuben. We certainly weren't disappointed!"}
{"text":"Nice little neighborhood market and deli. Really fresh and delicious sandwich and salad options. staff is super friendly. cute little market inside too."}
{"text":"Love the new location! Beers on tap now and the food is still delicious. The staff was very friendly and inviting."}
{"text":"Yessss love this place, the employees and owners! So much deliciousness! Perfect spot for anytime. It's a casual spot for great sandwiches and brunch. Bonus that they have beer on tap and great prices!"}
{"text":"I am a southern girl! Born and raised! I consider myself a biscuit connoisseur. Love homemade biscuits, momma's are the best. But these biscuits absolutely delicious. Makes me wanna slap my momma! The southern style is so yummy. Get it with the livermush. Tried it for the first time and Oh My Lawd!! You must try this place! It's so good!! Makes my tummy smile!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to NoDa Bodega and we are already talking about what we are going to order the next time we go back. We came for breakfast this time. I ordered the Bodega Style breakfast sandwich with bacon. It was delicious! My fiancé ordered the Bodega B.L.T.E. and said he loved it. We also ordered a side of tater tots (good, really crispy!) and the grits. The place is clean and the employees are friendly. Can't wait to check it out for lunch."}
{"text":"The new bodega is better than ever. First, great location with awesome parking. Next, the new specials are great - look at the potluck to see what's good. There's always something vegetarian which is super. Personal favorites: the falafel poboy, the pimento grilled cheese, and the vegetarian holy guacamole. Plus, the new decor is perfect - lots of space, clean, and it has a real \"New England\" grocery feel to it, which is great. Makes living in this neighborhood even better!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Bodega! We feel so lucky they're right up the block and we take full advantage. Great soups, sandwiches and beer/wine selection. The owners are super nice and you can tell they put blood, sweat and tears into making this place something special. They go the extra mile - like slicing meat and cheese fresh for each sandwich they make. They are also the only place in Charlotte I've found that cuts meats and cheeses the way they do in delis up north - nice and thin. Excited to watch them grow and hopefully add even more selection."}
{"text":"Everything is so fresh and full of flavor!! I have never been disappointed! I'm from NY and love true deli's, this is certainly comparable!"}
{"text":"Can we get one of these in my neighborhood? Whether you want a freshly-made sandwich, bottle of Bordeaux, jar of gourmet pickled veggies, or a  delicate cupcake you my friend have come to the right place! They are still in the midst of working with the city to serve alcohol (it's a parking-lot issue so they need to be rezoned as a walking destination). Once they do I can see this place being a one-stop shop for all my late-lunch needs!"}
{"text":"Tremendous customer service; the staff is very friendly! The sandwiches are of top quality and I would say it is a no-brainer to assess The Bodega as one of the best sandwich shops in Charlotte; #1 in my books."}
{"text":"Don't judge a bodega by its run down mini-strip mall. I've been stalking this places instagram for a while. They post their daily sandwich specials and they always look soooo good! Usually a bunch of ingredients that make you say \"hmm that could work.\" The first time we thought about going we never went in because we thought we weren't looking for something that casual, but they actually have a really nice setup in there! Plenty of tables and chairs, bar seating, and beer on tap.   After seeing the Sunday crowds out for brunch and not wanting to deal with that, we headed to Noda Bodega after seeing they were featuring a VA ham, pimento cheese, tomato and fried egg sandwich on pressed sourdough. We picked out a bag of chips to share and some bottled iced teas. The sandwich was really good and I appreciated being able to get in and out after enjoying a breakfast sandwich that was a little different.  Can't wait to go back and try something for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Neat little place.  I enjoyed the Caprese sandwich on a lazy Sunday for lunch.  Would recommend, has a nice 'local' feel."}
{"text":"The most fantastically delicious sandwiches possible in the most unlikely location! I'm a bit obsessed with this place and their Italian Stallion or the ham and cheese sandwich. They use creative ingredients and any place that substitutes prosciutto for ham is worth it. With the recent location change, this has opened up table space and the chance to crack one of their beers open or sip on a draft. Although, they took out the 'bodega' part of it. They used to have shelves of wine and candy and all other goodies they didn't really take with them. But that's not as important as the sandwiches.   Make a visit. You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"This is exactly what I look for in a sandwich place. Great food that comes out quickly, pretty quick, and the service is friendly. The building looks a bit sketchy from the outside, but once inside it's quite pleasant.  The only caveat I have to add is that they have a limited menu and always have a lot of daily specials running. This is great because it can add variety, but it really sucks when you find a \"favorite\" and then aren't able to have it again."}
{"text":"How much do I love this place? Well, the last two times I've been here I couldn't make up my mind what I wanted, so I just ordered two lunches. I'm a problem solver.   As much as I loved the their old, cozy location, this space is just so much better. It's bigger, there's more seating, and it's easier to park. I love the long counter. I typically do take out, but will always sit here if I'm staying.  Along with their regular menu, they always have different specials every day. Check their Facebook page, they always post them along with descriptions and pictures. Fridays they always have the G-Wich (london broil, three pepper cheese, jalapeno bacon), named in honor of my old roommate. Hi Greg. My favorite regular menu item here is the Greek salad. It's one of my favorite salads in Charlotte. I think it's the peppadew peppers that do it for me. The reuben and the Italian Stallion are both also great. I don't really think you can go wrong with anything here. Couple weeks ago, they did a chile relleno stuffed with sweet potatoes and over grits. Holy. Ridiculously delicious. They've also got a great selection of wine and beer. There's also a few drafts.   NoDa Bodega also landed at #9 on Yelp's 2016 Top 50 Places to Eat in Charlotte list. Huge congrats to them, love seeing spots like this getting much deserved recognition. Congrats!"}
{"text":"Went late on a Tuesday evening to grab the Italian stallion - awesome sandwich. Perfect amount of meat, tomato and dressing - pairs great with a bottled cheerwine. Beer options are slim, and no drinking on the property - permit on the way will change it!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, great brews and even better service. Can't go bad with boars head meat."}
{"text":"I went on a Sunday morning after reading the great reviews mainly about the Turkey Reuben sandwich so I decided to give it a try. I ordered one for me and my Fiancé, we felt the sandwich was just okay. I felt it was just a little pricey just for a sandwich and no side item which is $8. In total I ordered 2 Reubens one kids sandwich and a small house salad for $29. I am not cheap when it comes to good food but I felt it wasn't worth it.  The staff was really friendly and the restaurant was pretty busy while I was there. The parking lot was almost full. I might give their breakfast options a try one day being that it's pretty close to where I live."}
{"text":"Oh yea! One of the best sandwich places you will find in the Queen City.  My boyfriend introduced me to the Noda Bodega, and now I wouldn't go anywhere else if I'm looking for a quick bite to eat!  Fast service, super friendly, and they can accommodate any order.  You can sit in and eat or take out (I usually have my dog with me so I take out) - it'd be nice if they had seating outside though.  They do sell wine by the bottle which is a good plus."}
{"text":"Found this place while looking for something quick to eat one night and I was not disappointed. It is tucked away in a street off North Davidson and looks like a corner store that happens to sell sandwiches. You can pick up some craft beer, wine, and other snacks while there. The sandwich I got was delicious! And the guy who helped me was super nice and really laid back. I would definitely recommend this place if you want to grab a quick, satisfying sandwich."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first visit I was greeted by the friendly cashier and I had an amazing sandwich. The second time, my sandwich was plopped down in front of me and I was sent on my Merry way. No smiles no hellos. Just keep it moving. Good thing the food was good."}
{"text":"Great selection of unique food! Everyone there is friendly. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love going to The Bodega! We can easily walk from our house as it's in the neighborhood in a cute little house. The owners are usually around and super friendly. We love their beer and drink selection and the sandwiches are to die for. They have a standard daily menu, but the specials is where it's at. You could be waiting up to 15 minutes for your sandwiches, but I promise it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty secluded. If you don't know the neighborhood you'd probably never find it. Luckily I was on a food tour. Its a small convenient store with beer, wine, and other random goodies like yellow stone ground grits (yes I bought some). It has a deli counter and you can create your own sandwich. The owners are pretty cool people too! Look it up and stop in!"}
{"text":"Was too hungry and ended up ordering a sandwich and a salad. Both were so sufficient and were delicious."}
{"text":"By far the best Reuben in America!! It has no corn beef and no 1000 no sour kraut and it's AMAZING!!! I've always dislike the traditional Reuben bc I'm not a fan of any if the things on it but this turkey, (mustard based slaw) and Swiss cheese remake is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Noda Bodega - Has an Italian Sandwich every Northern in the South should eat. It feels and smells like home. This review is primarily for the Italian Stallion sandwich .  Bodega has many amazing offerings on their menu - but right now .. lets focus on the absolute genius that went into the preparation of this sandwich.  First- it takes forever- so it forces you to remain in the store, talking to strangers and getting to know your neighbors... like back in the north.  The sandwich comes on butcher paper and has that authentic oil and vinegar stain that lights up your heart.  And Peppadew relish on a baguette... !!  I truly enjoy being in the restaurant. its a good size and can welcome the conversation you want by sitting at the bar or gives you the privacy of tables tucked in to the corner. Its really a fantastic place with an awesome northern staple sandwich and I just love it."}
{"text":"I came across this little hidden spot while getting my car worked on. I was very happy on  how tasty  my Bodega house salad wrap and enjoyed the laid back atmosphere. I will definitely being going back."}
{"text":"Amazing and authentic food. Delicious baguettes  Greek salad and dressing definitely a good choice. I had smokehouse turkey which was unlike any other turkey sandwich. Also have several beers on tap. Homemade pimento cheeses potato salad, chicken salads and soups. Recommend to any one in the neighbor hood or outside."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and great employees. Their Cuban sandwich was delicious. Wasn't too crazy about the chicken salad, just mushy. They have a great selection of food, wine, and beers on tap. This is a fantastic lunch spot. The new location is bigger and has a good amount of seating."}
{"text":"They make some amazing food and if there is something that you are looking to get they can get it for you.  Nice local shop that is owned and operated by locals.  Doesn't get much better than that."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwich heaven.   I'm still trying to wrap my head around the actual store - which was still fairly empty. They have beer and wine (chilled and room temp), a small pre-made food selection (heat&eat lasagna, pimento cheese), drinks, a small deli, and two racks offering toilet paper and chips alongside pancake mix, olive oils, and higher end canned items. I'm guessing they'll be filling in the gaps in the future?   But, back to the deli. I ordered the ham & cheese, and my sister ordered the caprese (very similar except mine has the addition of prosciutto). Everything was sliced right in front of us, and then thrown on a panini press. As we were waiting we noticed the crunch berries bar, and knew we had to try it out. (Apparently they're experimenting with lots of breakfast cereals, and I'd stop in just to see what they were working on next.) There were only a few chairs and one table, which were occupied, so we hit the road with our sandwiches. When we did dig in, holy crap, salty explosion of tastiness (that went oh so well with a beer). prosciutto, pesto, mozzarella, tomato... definitely my kind of ham and cheese! Even the salads (which can be made into wraps if you wish) sounded really good.  I will definitely be back to try the other sandwiches (the special at the time was deviled egg salad with ham on wheat - kinda hoping that'll still be available). Great for picking one up on the go, especially if you're hitting up a brewery or the park. And they also had party platters you could order."}
{"text":"The daily special sandwich is the way to go. Don't be sceeered! It's usually a laundry list if ingredients but trust these guys they know their sandwiches. Some of my favorites are Hanoi Rocks (a spin on the classic banh mi) and Afternoon Delight (a suped-up turkey sandwich on ciabatta).  Great sandwiches aways take time, so grab a beer and have a seat. They recently opened up shop at their new location at 1200 East 35th Street; can't wait to check it out!"}
{"text":"Best service and sandwiches in town in my humble opinion ! Try the Italian Stallion and some local beer to go before you leave the Noda area. The small deserts are a hit too by the counter when you check out. Wish I had this place in my neighborhood, you guys are so lucky."}
{"text":"What is the NoDa Bodega?  It's one of Charlotte's hidden gems!  The sandwiches are all freshly handcrafted and they are so so yummy!  I usually walk in with something in mind, but I'm always drawn in by the daily specials.  They are so unique and an I am never disappointed!    They have a variety of ships and sundries to choose from, local beers on tap and in the bottle/can, ample seating, a bar, TV, WiFi, etc.  The old location was in an old house and was rather quaint with the decor of a quirky coffeehouse.  The new location isn't the least bit ostentatious, but once inside you'll see the space works well for them and has given them the ability to spread out and offer more seating.  It also offers better access from a main road and has a private parking lot.  It is a bit further away from the area most people know as NoDa, but it's really only a few blocks further away.  The daily special can be found on their Facebook page.  Be sure to check it out.  It has become one of my Charlotte favs for sure!  In fact, I think I just decided where I'll be heading for lunch today!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this bodega and overall it was a pleasant experience. I got the chicken melt and substituted the applewood bacon with jalapeño bacon. Honestly, I didn't taste much of the jalapeño but other than that the sandwich was great. It was the perfect size and very neat. Also, this place has cold brew on tap which is always a plus. I'm not giving it 5 stars because the wait was extremely long but that could be attributed to the fact that it was a Sunday morning. Next time I'm back in Charlotte I will be visiting this bodega again!"}
{"text":"Definitely a place that could be overlooked even though it is in a known neighborhood. Meaning, I live not so close yet drove farther than usual to grab a sandwich and give it a try. I can tell you I had the BEST blt with added avocado. So much flavor! You just wouldn't believe me unless you tried it! Looks like I will be driving to this end of Noda a little more often :)"}
{"text":"The customer service is always great. Super nice at the register and I get my food quickly. This team knows how to make a great sandwich and it's a good, easy and calm place to come get lunch during a busy day. Keep an eye out for the sign out front. It's still pretty small, but you'll see it!"}
