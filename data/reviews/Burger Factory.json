{"text":"Great customer service and the burgers are AMAZING.  Everything is made fresh to order. Definitely my new favorite burger place."}
{"text":"The burger was super good and juicy ! I got the Swiss and mushroom burger and customer service was great. I met the nice lady who owned the business and got to make a little small talk about who's the cook and stuff. She's super sweet and is and ways smiling ! Not to mention the burger was fulfilling and satisfying ! Will definitely come back! (:"}
{"text":"Save your money. If you like frozen hamburger patties and unseasoned onion rings give it a try. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"The food is great and the prices are reasonable. I was a little skeptical while reading the other reviews but i was impressed with the food and portion sizes. I ordered the bacon avocado burger and it was delicious. The all the veggie  were fresh and the burger was huge. The onion rings were my favorite; they didn't fall apart after being bit into!"}
{"text":"Great burgers (better than hero burgers). Small sit in area, great poutine too."}
{"text":"What an amazing burger!! I have to say the burger was hot, juicy meat, and together with the sweet potato fries = delicious. Nice staff and fresh food."}
{"text":"Ridiculous customer service. They messed up my order and I had to wait 45 minutes for another sub par burger. When I went to inquire why it was taking so long I was met with hostility and attitude. I suggest management teach their employees how to deal with customers in a respectful manner. Will not be coming back to this location and will ensure my family and friends don't either."}
{"text":"Food ; I came here a few weeks ago with my boyfriend, and we ordered a Teriyaki Burger with Extra Teriyaki Sauce on the side, ( thanks to my aunts recommendation ) it was like Heaven In a burger, It was so great! The Onions were well cooked and The bun was very toasty. We both Loved it!  Service:  ALRIGHT the service was PRETTY GREAT, me and my boyfriend wasn't able to get his name but he was Employee Number 5, He was Super nice! great customer service too!   i Highly recommend eating here when you go to galleria mall, it's super great and fulfilling."}
{"text":"Wow, this place was a disappointment. I came in to get a cheeseburger for my kid, and I'll never be coming back. The guy at the register was chatting with a friend and made me wait for a lapse in the conversation to take my order. They also charge extra for cheese (which isn't mentioned anywhere on the menu), and the guy kept talking to their friend while I ordered.   A few minutes later (way later than it should take to make a 2 oz burger) this sad little sandwich comes out with a glob of cheese on it and a bun twice as big as the meat. They had to run back and get me fries (as if they forgot what was on their own menu) and I had to ask for my drink. Of course the drink was flat, and the straw they gave me was smaller than the cup, like one of those little coffee straws. And the fries were soggy. Honestly, the only way they could have made the experience worse is if they straight up gave the wrong order."}
{"text":"We've been here so many times that they actually know us by name. Fantastic staff and even better burgers. The funnel cakes are to die for. I'd recommend getting it with strawberries and ice cream.   My go-to is he Juicy Lucy combo with fries."}
{"text":"Extremely delicious burgers and fries.  The customer service was top notch; they even let me sample the burger sauce before including it in my order.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here 4 days ago and I wasn't impressed. I had order a chicken burger and there was hardly any chicken, I felt the chicken was lost in the bun but had tons of flavour. As for the beef He felt the bun was soft, beef was flavourful but more bun then meat. Our burgers were upgraded to a combo and the poutine was too salty for me but he enjoyed. Spent about $25 for two burgers a poutine, fries and two drinks.  I wouldnt recommend anyone to eat here. I say buy your own ground beef season it to your liking and grill, pan fry or bake to perfection."}
{"text":"i have been going to the burger factory for 6 years.  this is a family run joint.  this is not a trendy place.  It reminds me of the small places in chicago and surrounding areas. you walk in they have a menu that goes on for days. burgers gyros fried chicken salads mexican food breakfast philly cheese steaks. this is a wonderful place to grab quick take out/carry out.  the food is not the best in the valley but for the price you will not get more bang for your buck anywhere else in the valley.  when 2 people can order dinner for under 15 bucks...its hard to beat.  this place is a dive but its run by nice people and man you just cant beat the food from this joint.  mcdonalds prices but 10 times the quality.  the brothers who run the registar are friendly and make sure you get VERY generous portions.  plus i love how they serve things. ie the 3peice chicken dinner. comes with a roll french fries and a few onion rings...and also a small salad.   you cant beat that anywhere in the valley for 7 bucks.   in 6 years i have probably  been there 150 times and never had bad food. very consistant. it wont knock your socks off but it will never dissapoint."}
{"text":"So I went to this restaurant and ordered the jucy lucy of fire combo with poutine. The burger was ok, i mean it wasn't that great but edible, the burger in it of itself would be a 2.5/5. However, however YOU DO NOT MESS WITH THE POUTINE. There is one and only one simple way of making poutine. Fries with gravy and CHEESE CURDS, not shredded cheese. Who the hell, puts shredded mozzarella on fries and gravy, and then has the audacity to call it poutine. Now thats just disrespectful man. The chef needs to visit montreal and see what a poutine looks like. and taste it, and learn what a poutine tastes like. The Burger Factory should go to montreal and apologize to every montreal man woman and child for calling such an atrocity, poutine."}
{"text":"Came craving a cheese burger and no line !!! when i saw the cook/only employee on duty i was on easy. i walked up to the counter and he is on his phone. then takes my order puts on gloves to handle the food and goes back to picking up his phone takes it behind the wall to cook the burger while still using the gloves while holding his phone the entire time. i am on easy about eating the burger i just paid for."}
{"text":"Great Burgers and Fries! Happy Tummy! I will eat here anytime I have that \"need a big juicy Burger\" feeling! No prefab Burgers for this chickie!"}
{"text":"The best french fries, perfect. Burgers were good. Plenty of food for the money.  Lots of choices on the menu. From breakfast to ribeye steaks, his place has variety.  Prices were reasonable, food was fresh, service prompt.   We will eat here again, I'm sure."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service sucks! They only gave me 2 napkins for four people and when you ask for more they give you an attitude! I understand that as a business you have to save money but service comes first!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for their carne asada burrito since 1994.  This little place has a huge menu. From breakfast, burgers, mexican food, gyros, cheesesteaks, and...ribeye steak? The burgers are average but the combo deal is a good value. I'm not a fan of the deep-fried items but you get a lot of it. The pastrami is big, tasty and greasy (mmm, grease). The cosmopolitan cheesesteak is nicely seared and seasoned well.  Their version of the carne asada burrito is massive. The savory cuts of meat are seared on the griddle and then mixed in with some tomatoes and green peppers. A nice amount of cheese and some lettuce top it off. It comes with a green chili salsa with just enough bite and when added to the burrito makes it super flavorful. It's one of the most satisfying, consistently-consistent, inexpensive, comfort-sort of foods I've ever had. It's less than $7. You will find a gristle or two in the meat. If you get it to-go, rotate the burrito every 5-10 minutes. The juices will settle to one side and make it soggy, but tasty, mess.  It does get busy during the week at breakfast and lunch and there's nothing in the way of ambiance or decor - their specials are on signs all over. The counter-service takes only cash but it's quick and to-the-point."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  I still order the patty melt veggie style but not long ago, I dragged a friend here to check out breakfast.  YUM! Check out the pic I posted of the VEGGIE BREAKFAST BURRITO. It was wonderful. As usual, courteous, efficient service."}
{"text":"Tucked away little hole in the wall restaurants generally fall into two categories: authentic little gems or somewhere you might get dysentery.   Burger Factory falls solidly into the latter. I got the Chicken Enchilada plate with rice and beans. The red sauce was pretty good, but most likely came out of a can. The rice and beans were alright, but buried beneath a generous helping of lettuce, guacamole and what I think was tzatziki sauce. I mean, sour creme generally doesn't come with herbs and seasoning in it.   The chicken -- if that was what it was -- was barely recognizable nuggets of meat. Fatty, tough and rubbery in texture, the meat caused me to give up barely a quarter of the way into the meal. After I dumped the rest of the food in the trash, I brushed my teeth.   I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Solid food for a good price. Menu is pretty big but I've never ventured off the burgers. Came here for breakfast once and I'd probably go to Dennys next time."}
{"text":"After seeing Burger Factory open up on Queen West recently we finally stopped by for lunch. We were craving burgers so this was a perfect opportunity to try this new neighborhood joint. The fact that they serve Halal meat impressed us. If you're not familiar with Halal you should definitely try it as the meat is much more tender and flavorful than regular meat. You can definitely tell the difference once you bite into the burger.   We ordered their regular cheeseburger and it tasted great. We found the burgers juicy and tasty. We opted for one serving of regular fries and one serving of the Tornado fries. The Tornado fries are basically fried potatoes, thinly sliced, seasoned and stacked on a long skewer stick. The fries were fresh cut, crunchy and equally satisfying. We were happy with our first encounter at Burger Factory we decided to come back a few weeks later. Again, our experience was just as consistent. We received quick and attentive service and served fresh and tasty orders. This time I tried the Juicy Lucy and regular French fries. The burger was evenly cooked and flavorful.   We're happy to discover a burger joint that serves what a real burger should taste like. We will definitely be coming back to try out the other items on Burger Factory's menu."}
{"text":"Breakfast starts the day here with your choice of standard breakfast platters of your choice of eggs, hash browns, bacon, ham, pancakes or you can go with their breakfast burrito (served with a side of fresh salsa). The gyros, Mexican food or, of course, burgers for lunch. All good options. A cheeseburger combo with fries and a drink is about $7 (I get it without the 1000 Island)"}
{"text":"I usually get the Egg and Bacon breakfast plate, which includes hash brown and toast w/ jelly packets, overall, it's good. I like to drizzle a little of their hot sauce on the hash browns. I haven't tried their lunch specials yet, so looking forward to that (heard the guacamole burger is good!) Also, I ordered their fried zucchini before, not a big hit for me, but to each is their own.   Staff members are always friendly. I would recommend if you want to try something other than your regular breakfast take outs."}
{"text":"Last time I was here was about a year ago. Got the veggie burger, was very good. Staff was very nice and the quality was great,  tasty food.  Would for sure go again."}
{"text":"Decided to try out this place, nice atmosphere with friendly staff.   The reason I gave this place a 2 is because of the food, ordered the chicken fillet with tornado fries. The chicken fillet was dry and heavily salted same goes for the tornado fries. I hope that in the future the owners could add less salt in their burgers and less salt on their fries.   I dont think ill be coming back."}
{"text":"The food in here is okay. The burgers are actually quite good but avoid this place at all costs during lunch peak times. The order will either be missing, wrong, undercooked and it will take at least 30 minutes to be given to you. Quite disappointed after coming couple of times and waiting for a burger for more that 30 minutes and getting something less than average. This place needs better management and cleaning."}
{"text":"Roaches.....R O A C H E S. When confronted, they just brushed it off. 1 star = -387387472 stars"}
{"text":"I was hungry but wasn't sure what to eat and this was a spot that had a small menu. I decided to give it a try and ordered a teriyaki burger with a side of onion rings. It was absolutely delicious! It was a decently sized burger and the ingredients were really fresh! Lettuce was nice and crispy with flavorful tomatoes! If you come here I would definitely recommend this burger! I could only give it 4 stars because it was a bit pricey compared to everything else the mall had, but a good place to eat nonetheless. I have yet to try the other items but I would definitely back to try the other options."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries !! The sweet potato fries were wonderful as well as the mushroom Swiss burger !! Thanks for the great food"}
{"text":"Cheap burgers for a fancy price. Reminded me of those rubber burgers you got in grade school. Not worth the $10 I spent. I won't be going back soon."}
{"text":"Dependable... good food, large portions, reasonable prices and quick service.  I come here fairly regularly for lunch takeout, so can't comment on dining area.  I like their Colossal Burger, Bacon Avo Cheeseburger, Chili Size, BLT sandwich and salads.  I'm always surprised by the size of the meals and think \"quantity over quality,\" but it's not so.  Everything is flavorful and well-seasoned.  Don't expect baby field greens and truffle-infused oil... this isn't that sort of place.  You will get tasty food and not feel like you're getting overcharged."}
{"text":"Been here numerous times in the past couple of years, and have never been disappointed with anything I have ordered. Great cheeseburger combo for six bucks. Usually stop by these days for the breakfast burrito in the morning, always excellent... It's definitely worth stopping by."}
{"text":"I came to the restaurant first time last night at around 9:20ish. Heard a lot of reviews and people were talking about it. With all the high expectation and excitment I came, I am sorry to say your service is below below waay below average. The food was good I really liked the meat in comparison to HERO burger your meat was a lot mroe delicious and tasteful. I won't lie on that. But I don't know if your staff has issues in kitchien, with each other, because they are working over time, or they are tired and it is sunday night, or they have a bad life but don't bring it to the customer. nothing is perfect and noone is perfect. I am paying $15 for a meal i expect a smile on the persons face, a thank you and not to kick me out at exactly 9:59 (yes i looked at the clock) that is extremely RUDE. You can ask me we are closing, you can wait clearly just WAIT as I was done.. but no your staff kicked me out. I was actually havING a good time with my family and left with a bad taste in my mouth. Not from your food but from your service. I know for a fact I WOULD NEVER ever refer you to anyone not bcus your food was great but your service was so bad it pissed me off.  i am so upset. I was watching the tv and laughing with my frends and family while walking out.  Your staff come in my face takes the remote and SHUTS THE TV DOWN.. SERIOUSLY? This is what you do when the customer is looking at the tv and talking about it. you should train  your employees. i don't give a shit if its 9:59 or 9:58 if a customer is sitting there.. just wait until they are gone.. bcus you gotta clean up anyway. thats the problem with HALAL places. either their service is bad, food or they are high priced for no reason. i thought you were worth it but i guess everyone falls in one category.. I hope NOONE has to experience this"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Burger place. The staff it's incredibly kind. The food is better than any fast food place. If it want 40 minutes away I'd eat here every day... Oh wait... They deliver shitty grub hub. No need to get a burger anywhere else"}
{"text":"This is the worst burger ever, I never had this kind of burger in my life....  Smells like dead dog meat...  People giving good reviews they don't know what is the burger..."}
{"text":"Came in and ordered a Sourdough Burger,  small onion rings, and a drink from the cashier who could hardly speak understandable English. came out to like $12, and my order was wrong. The bread wasn't real sourdough, the burger patty was bland and rubbery, the onion rings had some type of cornmeal batter and had a bright orange tint, they were pretty horrible, although the cup of ranch they gave me to dip them in was some of the best ranch I have ever had.   This place tastes exactly like Burger Rush in Tempe, like eerily similar. The only difference is that it's in a run down building and their customers are mostly the elderly, or younger adults who I can only describe as \"methy.\""}
{"text":"I thought I would try out Burger Factory, ignoring the reviews on here. I ordered the burger and my partner ordered the stuffed burger. They were both dry, even with a lot of sauces on it - still very dry.   The tornado fries were kind of cool. Something I would expect from the CNE. Like spiralled potatoes on a stick that were deep-fried like potatoes chips. They were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and lightly salted.   Their regular fries were really good. They tasted like New York fries.   We ordered funnel cake with chocolate sauce for dessert. It was soft with a crunchy edge. The chocolate sauce tasted like nothing. It was disappointing.   I don't think we would order from here again."}
{"text":"Visiting from USA, late night decided to chow out. Stop at this place 10 mins before closing. Great staff, didn't showed any frustration on making late large order. Excellent burgers. JUICY LUCK ON FIRE IS A must try. Kids loved it."}
{"text":"The burger is pretty yummy, fries not so much unless you get the tornado fries which is a better choice. If you plan on going there make sure you take out as it isn't really a dine-in place. Juicy burgers, there is one with cheese inside the patty.. the idea seems cool but I rather have the cheese on top of my patty so I can taste it. The customer service was reaalllyy good!  Finally happy to find a good burger joint (bonus it is halal!)"}
{"text":"Came with friends that had burgers and Philly cheese steak. They enjoyed it. I had a poutine which was seriously good. You have to try that. Too much gravy though lol. Cheese is good and fries are too. The seating isn't bad but the restaurant itself isn't in the best shape. They are busy most of the time. It feels like a hygienic place and I liked my first experience."}
{"text":"I am not a fan.  The burgers are okay!  I have been their once and won't return.  With \"Burger\" in the name of the restaurant I was expecting much better.  It was weird experience eating there.  What made it weird is the fact that it would of been a great burger except for the meat patty.  It was very thin and flavorless.  The toppings on the other hand were very fresh and tasty.  I had a bacon and avocado burger.  The bacon was thick, the avocado and the other toppings were great.   In the end this factory needs to be re-tooled to make a better burger."}
{"text":"This place is one of very few that actually give you real homemade burgers. Awesome love their burgers taste great. Only downside is their French fry portions are a bit small, so I order two :-)"}
{"text":"First time here and I had to wait over 25 mins for my order. When I got up to find out what was taking so long, the worker said they didn't have my order receipt. What happened was after my order was placed a customer that was already eating placed an order for another burger. Instead of putting his order in line with the rest of the orders the lady rushed his and pushed everything back and ended with my order being misplaced.  Asked for a refund after being told it was going to be another 10 minutes. Horrible first visit, never got an apology or anything, will never go back."}
{"text":"Just had a BBQ cheese burger with bacon it was delicious!! The burger was perfect and I'm very picky so I definitely recommend The Burger Factory!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Huge menu! Burger Factory fills a great void in my decision making. If I don't quite know what to eat, Burger Factory is up the street! This place is not fancy to look at, but the food has always been good and I don't think they have ever messed up my order in the 15+ years that I have visited them. Where else can you go to get Burgers, fried chicken, fish, pastrami, Mexican food and Greek food and where would my life be without their breakfast?"}
{"text":"Had the Juicy Lucy on Fire, fries and poutine. Burger was just okay, not juicy at all, actually kind of dry. Fries were yummy but gravy was a tad on the salty side for the poutine. Service was great."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of the char broiled burger spots all over Southern California.  I have been coming here for years. Burgers are excellent!!! On the down side, the french fries are always undercooked which is a waste of money in my opinion. Stick with the burgers, if you like crispy fries don't waste your time or $."}
{"text":"A decent burger, and fair pricing. The fries were tasty, too. Main drawback was not being asked how the burger should be cooked, which I'd expect from a fresh meat burger joint. Worth checking out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Great tasting burgers and the poutine is pretty good too. Wish the fries were better, but overall 5*"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.  You want a good burger carelessly thrown in your direction?  This is the place for you.   The pastrami is good and so are the burgers. But if you want to be treated like your business matters, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"It all started when Yousaf vwas like this is the best place to get a burger when all Zaeem wanted was waffles. Then YS was crushing on AA and then juicy Lucy shows up. Awesome"}
{"text":"Very mediocre burgers. I tried the Juicy Lucy on Fire which is supposed to have mozzarella and Jalapeno's inside the patty, but it honestly could've been a plain hamburger and I wouldn't be able to tell the difference - that's how lackluster it was. They also have 3 different menus with different prices and when I wanted fried onions on my burger (which was in the \"top it\" section on one of the print menus with no mention of an additional charge, they charged me $0.50 extra and couldn't explain it. 2 minutes later, they put on a digital menu which showed the supposed \"most updated\" menu. I don't know why they charge $9.99 for the Juicy Lucy on Fire and I wish I'd checked out the reviews before ordering from here"}
{"text":"Would have gave it 4 stars cause the food is good, I just cannot stand the Asian cashier they have there. 3rd and maybe the last time I will go. He is just a rude person. I would gladly take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I visited the new Burger Factory location in Vaughan  the burgers were great, the staff was friendly and they have a lot more seating than in mississauga."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in a long time, it was fresh and made from real beef and cooked in front of me, the poutine was great too.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Love the juicy Lucy. Only thing is very cramped space and slow service. But great burgers and funnel cakes as well."}
{"text":"From the outside this downtown-ish restaurant doesn't look like much. Just a large white block. It seems like it should be a taqueria or at least small on the inside... but don't let the looks fool you! it's big on the inside... well - at least bigger than I thought it'd be!   I grabbed breakfast here and had the original breakfast burrito... this bitch comes with scrambled eggs, hash browns, bacon, sausage, ham and cheese. I asked for it without the ham because three meats would've been gluttonous! :P   I grabbed some mountain dew for the caffine I needed to get through this day, and good mercy! When I saw this huge monstrosity - I wished I asked for it without the sausage too! but I managed! Good and freshly cooked, but when I was ordering I saw the cooks cook up large orders of hashbrowns and there weren't that many people there. Soooo they pre-cook some of their stuff with. I think I was fortunate to have been there early... but if you're going to come later in the morning - I unno... things might not be that fresh. I loved my burrito but it was a LOT of food! I think I'll just stick to my bacon and egg burrito from now on.   I can't wait to try their burgers!"}
{"text":"Not just a burger place! the menu contains a wide variety of foods., Just to name a few-  Mexican, Gyros, breakfast foods, real milkshakes, Philly steaks, sandwiches and salads. The portions are large and the pricing is great!    I mean C'mon, steak & eggs for $5   !!    Great meal deals and efficient servers. THANK YOU burger factory!"}
{"text":"Trash quality burgers, bad service. Wouldn't go there again if they paid me. I don't recommend this place a ton of other places serve better quality for less if not same price.."}
{"text":"My wife and I like to travel, and eat at (at least) one local hamburger shop. The Burger Factory is by far one of the best I've eaten at. The burger was fresh and juicy, the onion rings were hot, crispy and tasty, and the service was friendly. Expect a wait because the burgers are made to order, but it's well worth the wait! I will be coming back when in the Las Vegas area!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are just like Big Mo's burgers. Full of flavour, hand made and delicious. Thick juicy, maybe try the juicy Lucy which has cheese stuffed in to the patty. Would recommend trying the funnel cake and poutine as well."}
{"text":"Burgers were fresh but they had an aftertaste to me. The fries weren't the greatest, they were soggy. It isnt really too good of a place to sit and relax. After looking around this is definitely not worth coming back for."}
{"text":"Don't normally write reviews but this place deserves the 5 stars I gave! Flavorful burger, cooked just right made with perfection. Definitely try it out if you're in the area. You will not regret it. Excellent food."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town. I tried many other places in Mississauga but couldn't find better one. I wish there is better ventilation though."}
{"text":"I have to admit I paused for a minute.  I was in search of a good lunch and was looking for a fish and chips place.  Instead I found this place located in a strip mall.  What gave me pause was a man of middle eastern descent was yelling at two ladies with covered faces to stay in the van.  You go inside and most of the patrons are clearly Muslim.   You look at the menu and the food here is Halal, so the customer base begins to make sense.    They didn't seem disturbed by this Roman Catholic coming in for some chow so it was cool.  Never thought I would see a Halal burger joint but here it is.  I ordered a Juicy Lucy with fries.  Ground beef is fresh and is pressed on the griddle, fries are hand cut.  So when you get your meal, the fries are hot and somewhat limp the way hand cut fries should be, burger takes a while to make but when you get it, hot and juicy.  They also sell funnel cakes which I passed on.  To be honest, this is among the best burger and fries I've ever eaten.  Allah has certainly blessed my plate the day I ate here and I can't wait to come back and have more.  It's true, the best way to build a community is through food."}
{"text":"Golly. I was hoping this location would be better than the Mississauga location. Nope.   I ordered the burger and fries. The burger was just so weird. The bun was completely soaked in grease and the edges of the bun were super crispy (almost as if it had been deep fried in oil). It was the most bizarre bun I've ever had on a burger. How did they achieve this? I cannot even hazard a guess.  The patty was dry. Not as dry as the one I had in Mississauga, but still dry. I suspect they're using a too lean ground beef. It's hard to keep a burger juicy if you're starting off with a low fat ratio. I always use medium ground when I make burgers. It's just the way to go.   The fries were truly a disappointment. They were stupendously good in Mississauga, but they were just floppy, greasy and limp here. Perhaps the oil's at the wrong temp. I don't know. I probably won't return. Stupid Burger isn't too far from here and they've never done me wrong."}
{"text":"I was driving by this place and thought I'd try it. I ordered the burger combo with fries.   First the positives:  1. The fries were amazing! I love these fries. Thick-cut, fresh not frozen, potatoey insides, crisp exteriors, not overly greasy. Absolute fry perfection. Like the best chip chuck fries. Oh my golly. I will come back here again and have the fries. So yummy.  2. The girl taking my order was super friendly.  3. They had Just for Laughs Gags on so it was fun to watch while waiting for my order.  The negatives:  1. Took a while for my order. At least 15 minutes, maybe more. No one was in front of me, but I guess they were busy making call ahead orders. Calling ahead is probably something you want to do if you're planning on coming here. If you're just driving by and come here on a whim, be prepared to wait.  2. They're renovating the bathrooms and so they're not available for customer use. I just wanted to wash my hands. The contractor was in the ladies' so I tried that men's room. It was obviously in the midst of being renovated as well. There was no mirror, no handsoap. I did find some handsoap outside of the washroom and brought that in to wash my hands.   3. My burger patty was dry. Really dry. No moisture to be found anywhere dry. I was hoping this was a one-off bad burger experience, but another reviewer warned that you should be prepared to like your burger overly charred and over well done. That's a shame. This place could be a real contender if it didn't insist on cooking their burgers to the point where every bit of moisture has been obliterated.   I may go back and try another burger hoping for a more juicy patty, but even if that doesn't pan out, at least I know the fries are exceptional."}
{"text":"Great burgers and onion rings. I always get the avocado and bacon burger. The sauce that comes on their burgers has a great flavor. The pastrami on the burger is delicious as well. They have a huge menu, but I haven't really tried anything else. I hear the breakfast burritos are amazing."}
{"text":"Going to give Burger Factory a 5 star because I am pretty happy to have them in move into Ajax.  Even more now that there is a burger price war going on - Heck Ya!    I think they make a pretty good burger, but no need to trust me.    They have a cheeseburger special  $3.99 happy hour from 4-7pm Monday to Wednesday,  Your best bet is to check them out on one of these days and figure out if you like their burger.  It is fresh homemade, $4 bucks on happy hour.  So see for yourself - give it a shot after work!"}
{"text":"Good authentic burgers in an area filled with chains. Pretty juicy burgers if you get their special juicy Lucy patties. They're thick patties with the right amount of doneness. They also have great toppings like sriracha and grilled onions and their special sauce."}
{"text":"I ordered a combo from here which was $8.99 this included a burger, fries, and a drink. I have a younger daughter so I needed a cup to pour in for her. The lady working who may be the owner was overly rude and did not have any people skills. She told me out loud \"we don't have cups!\" This is the first time I have ever experienced a restaurant tell me they don't have a cup. NEVER AGAIN WOULD I COME BACK AND WOULD NOT RECOMMMEND this place. Better to pay more and get good service and get good food."}
{"text":"I had the burger with the gluten free bun.  It was a bit dry as a result of it. The meat was soft and fresh, more salt would have brought out the flavor. I saw an employee without a hairnet which was a turnoff."}
{"text":"#YelpGTABBW #YelpBurgerBinge #BurgerBingeWeek  The place has been on my bookmarks for some time now... then came the Yelp Burger Binge Week with halal friendly options. So I thought what better week to try this place.   So I made my way to the place... the restaurant itself is quite small and has very limited seating. The staff looked tired and a bit slow but it was all about the burgers.   I went with the Juicy Lucy selling for $5 in the burger bing week but is actually $7. Well let me tell you that Lucy was very Juicy... The beef patty is of a nice size and is cooked well. Inside the middle of the patty there is cheese in the burger. The topping are great and plenty to choose from.  I also got the 5oz Hamburger. The burger is pretty much the same but doesn't have cheese in between. But I really enjoyed their Poutine as they gravy was very taste.   Over all if you exclude the presentation of the burgers.... the patty itself is quite good and enjoyable.   Will I go back... definitely, I still have to try their \"The Compressor\"!   For my Muslim Folks - The serve halal meat as stated on their site \"ALL OUR MEAT & PRODUCTS ARE 100% HALAL\" plus halal signs in the store."}
{"text":"I was up here during lunch with a coworker. The restaurant itself is decent size and much bigger than the Mississauga location.   I went with the cheese burger and topped it with a poutine as a side!... The beef patty is of a nice size and is cooked well and it felt like I was actually have a nice cheese burger. The burger was so good that I couldn't stop and I swallowed it in no time! Then came the time for poutine, I really enjoyed their poutine as the gravy was very taste.  Overall, a good burger joint!   For my Muslim Folks - The serve halal meat."}
{"text":"Worst burger place ever. Felt like I was eating school cafeteria food at best. What kind of restaurant turns their shake machine off at 6 pm? Food was cold except for the zucchini which was also subpar. I would never eat at this sh**hole again. Yuck!!!"}
{"text":"Food is ok, service is better. Portions are small and menu is overpriced. Better off going with some other burger joints.  I ate 2 burgers and 2 sides and was still hungry.  Not worth the $$$."}
{"text":"This location needs to be removed from Uber eats and Yelp. Lady claims to cancel my order and not deliver it because she didn't have chicken for 2 out of the ten items I ordered"}
{"text":"Love love love it! Best Teri burger I've had since moving from Cali. I'll be back A LOT!!!!"}
{"text":"I love to eat, but I didn't \"love\" eating at Burger Factory. The orders can take a while and they're not bad... but they're not worth the wait when you have as little time left as I do. Maybe it was because I was forced to watch Just for Laughs on their TV, but overall I had a below average dining experience. Tornado Fries were too salty, regular fries were pretty good, burgers were good and fresh. It'd be nice if there were hot dogs on the menu, but overall I'd say 3.5 / 5. #itiswhatitis"}
{"text":"Not your average take-out joint!  The Burger Factory has a large menu with lots of variety choose from. Although their are burgers are delicious, and come in many forms, they also have many other delicious menu items that are worth trying. They have everything from burgers, burritos, gyros, and everything in between. I would recommend guacamole burger.   The staff members are very friendly and want to make sure that you have a pleasurable dining experience.  The interior is typical of a fast food restaurant and probably below average but does not detract at all from the experience as a whole."}
{"text":"I usually go for burgers at Carl's Jr , Five Guys, or places like that but after eating here, I'm hooked!  The Teriyaki Burger was juicy and flavorful. They use really good meat!  My only wish was that it had a grilled pineapple, so I told the manager and they are looking into it!  Next time I'll try the wings!  They just opened so I understand that they may not be up to speed yet, but that will get better in no time.  2 thumbs up, 5 stars, 10 spoons, and all that!"}
{"text":"This is the only place I run to when I need a burger. Cheeseburgers and juicy lucy being my favorites. The restaurant is decent for sit down.  The burgers are downright delicious. The meat is juicy and tasteful. The cheese is right. Gives you a melt in your mouth medley along with a beautiful meaty texture.  If you haven't had enough of the burger. Proceed to order the funnel cake. Should fill you right up to your neck.  Hands down one of the best halal burger options in town."}
{"text":"So fortunate to have an American diner drive through here in the neighbourhood. Call first pick up in the drive through the burger factory will provide the best in American fare. Burgers, steaks, fish, chicken, gyros, Mexican, burros, breakfast, they do it all! High quality quick service and the best ranch dressing you've ever tasted. Six stars"}
{"text":"Burgers, breakfast, Philly's, Mexican food and Gyros.... oh my!! This place has the biggest menu of mixed flavors I've ever seen. The co-workers and I go here at least a couple times a month since its just down the road. I feel kind of bad reviewing this place because I've never actually tried their burgers and I'm guessing that is their specialty so I'll have to update this once I've tried them. We work super early so I always get breakfast. I was really disappointed in the biscuits and gravy but then I tried the Original Breakfast Burrito and that is what made me fall in love with this place. The thing is HUGE and only cost $4 bucks..what! No need to decide what kind of meat you want this BEAST comes with all three..sausage, ham and bacon. All wrapped up with eggs, hash browns and  cheese. This place looks like a dive but most of the best places do. Can't wait to try the burgers!"}
{"text":"Plenty of thick cut fries that are very well made.  Crunchy on the outside, but still retain some warm softness on the inside.  Burger was freshly made and great size with plenty of toppings to choose from (prefer this to Fresh burger across the street mainly because of this although maybe a $1-$1.50 more).  Friendly service and clean place."}
{"text":"No, no, no. Half Chinese food, half burger joint with Mexican food? Cash only? Greasy feeling just from walking in? Tried this place because I kept hearing good things, but it was a total let down. There was an accidental piece of orange chicken in my bag of French fries...burger wasn't memorable, but I remember not really thinking that the vegetables were....vegetables. Quite gross."}
{"text":"I usually do drive-in and frankly never had Mexican food there before, just love the Chili Burger, Monster Burger, Pastrami Burger but until today no Mex.  But tonight, wow! Green Chili Burrito, huge, BIG chunks of really tasty beef, bell pepper, all kinds of stuff. Truly fine food. I'm impressed and very full of quality ingredients, with tax $5.45.  Viva Burger Factory!"}
{"text":"Burgers were very thin but large in circumference. Not bad but have had better. Was very impressed with the chili, all meat no beans, borders on spicy and very thick. Will go back."}
{"text":"Good burgers for a decent price. Juicy Lucy on Fire has remained as my favourite. I didn't know they had funnel cakes until my recent visit. The funnel cake was pretty good too, crispy exterior and soft interior with a side of jam and a scoop of Ice cream. Wait time was quite longer than usual."}
{"text":"A new gourmet burger joint that opened some time ago. The difference from the other similar places being that they give you some value for your money in terms of  large burger (when compared to the competition). I like to go here every so often. I usually get the triple \"compressor\" burger combo with the fries on a stick/skewer and a pop. What kills this place is the horrible decor,  less than spectacular service, and lack of fruit juices, etc in place of pop. Small changes would yield large dividends."}
{"text":"the burger patty  has way to much fat ratio to meat, we picked two burgers by the time we drove from Eg/Dixie to Mavis/Eg, the fat in the meat had solidified, and it was  disgusting ..."}
{"text":"Burger Factory is a decent burger joint. I do not find their burgers horrible, nor are they exceptional. If you're really in a bind, I say go for it. If you really want to satisfy your burger cravings, I say go elsewhere. Plus their burger buns are terrible, and being a burger lover, buns are a vital part of a burger experience! As for their tornado fries, that's a winner! Love the crispy texture of those babies!"}
{"text":"Every single person who works here has their phone attached to them. I stood and waited for the cashier to finish his text so i could order. Instead of a \"hello\". I got, \"oh, sorry.\"  At least he said sorry, I guess.  I ordered a BBQ  burger, and upgraded to the combo (fries and a drink) for about $3, yes.... $3 more.   Ge told the cook, who was also bent over a counter, texting, my order.  A little while  later, i walked up to get my order. Before the kid could reach for his phone, again, i asked for my drink. Another \"oh, sorry.\"  Now to the food.... the bun was fluffy,  and the BBq sauce had a decent amount of flavor, without being something crazy. The fries were fluffy as well....but needed some serious flavor after coming out of the fryer. Some salt would have hone a long way.   For around $7, id rather spend the extra $3 and get greek food a few feet away."}
{"text":"There sure is a lot of complainers here talking about cash only. Do none of you carry $10 bucks with you? Actually even less then that? Anyways ranking an establishment because they don't take debit or credit is just a joke. Focus on the food people.   Came here and met up with some friends and I'm a huge fan of BLTs and saw they had it on the menu. I ordered it on wheat bread and they also added avocados.  Let me tell you this, they sure don't skimp on the bacon. The sandwich alone will fill you up and it was delicious. Lettuce was fresh and crispy, tomatoes were great and the avocados gave it that extra kick.  I would recommend getting the BLT   They have the normal steak type fries, not sure what they are called, but they are the bigger cut fries and they tasted good as well just like most places. Can't really mess up on fries.  My buddy got the chicken wings and they were pretty good. They were crispy and juicy inside.   Free refills like any other joint, has the old school look inside but was clean when I was there.   I would come back again."}
{"text":"Ordered the Original Breakfast burrito from this place and added chorizo to it.  I ordered with a group so take from this as you wish.  It was around 5 bucks.  The burrito was massive.  It must have weighed close to a couple of pounds.  It looked like a freaking brick.  Everything inside the burrito was cold.  The hashbrowns were undercooked.  There was not much flavor out of anything.  The chorizo was bland and could have used some seasoning.  The pico that came with it was tasty enough.  Had a good vinegar bite to it.  The red salsa was somewhere between Red Devil and Louisiana Hot Sauce.  Nothing special.  Not sure if I would order from here again."}
{"text":"This is my sorta place. It reminds me of The Hat back in socal. Nothing here is going to win a michelin star, but that's not why you come in. Pretty big menu, very consistent quality."}
{"text":"Not fancy - but good well above average food.  the place may be called the burger factory but i have been ordering the gyro - and it is very good!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here and I think these are consistently one of the best and juiciest Halal burgers out there. I like that the location is right outside Vaughan Mills, the price is a bit high for a burger but it's the going rate now. There is a little bit of a wait time but I think it's worth it. Other good Halal burger joints include Burgenator and On the Bun.  I like all of their sides except the Poutine, it has way to much gravy and everything gets soggy. They put a nice spice blend on their hand-cut fries when their done that's really tasty (some say its too salty... meh)."}
{"text":"Some kid who like to show off his boxers by having their jeans low made the burger and the overcooked fries. Been here a couple of times, not good here. I don't think they care about what their are doing, just want to make some extra . I suggest going to A&W down the street, much better quality control."}
{"text":"This place is gross. It all tastes the same - greasy and disgusting."}
{"text":"Didn't really enjoy the burger. Tasted very generic like something I would cook at home from a frozen box of patties. The poutine was good but since this place is known for its burgers (according to its name) I have to give it below average for taste.   Another complaint I have is that the seating area was really crammed.. It was hard to fit the 4 of us comfortably at lunch time.  I won't be going back here."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place, finally got the chance to try it. Burger was really overcooked and the bun was way bigger than the burger meaning the first few bites I just got bread. Toppings were solid though. Won't be back, way better options all over the GTA."}
{"text":"I liked their cheeseburger, I just hated their shitty attitude. It's worth stopping by if you feel like eating a burger.  Besides that, there is nothing great about this place. I could pass by for a cheeseburger anyother day when I feel like it, but certainly not because they have people skills."}
{"text":"Good burger.  I had the juicy juicy (the hot version).   The burger was stuffed with cheese and jalapeños.   While I did not like the fries they were fresh cut not packaged frozen."}
{"text":"For fast food, these guys make a great burger--no joke! Great service too, so polite. Check it out...just make sure you bring cash cause BF is not taking your plastic."}
{"text":"Pre-cooked and re-heated hamburger patties. Why?? When we went in there was only one other table being occupied so why couldn't they take the time to cook two fresh patties for the  two burgers we ordered? They only thing I can think of is that they had leftover cooked patties from lunch time that they didn't want to throw away. I noticed after we ordered that there was nothing cooking on the grill. Then the cook put the buns on to toast...still no meat cooking. Finally, I saw the cook take two cooked patties out of a container next to the grill so I asked if the meat was pre-cooked and they said yes...smh. I won't be back. :("}
{"text":"Great food; great staff Been waiting for it to open in vaughan for months, definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"it was really baaaad! i don't know who gave it good reviews but i would never go back there again! the service is really slow and the burgers are unedible!"}
{"text":"I really wish I had a dagger to stab myself in the face for trying to eating here. Absolutely the WORST PLACE in the entire valley. I would turn around and go ask for my money back but I am to embarrassed to even be seen in the drive through again.   Was on my way home, thought I would give it a shot. I ordered random items; chicken taco and onion rings. The taco was like eating out of a horse trough.. It fell apart immediately and I found myself trying to shovel it into my mouth. After about two bites I realized the meat was questionably chicken. The onion rings were so blah I didn't even touch them.   Please do your self a favor.. Dig in the nearest dumpster for lunch, then go home and pound a bottle of vegetable oil. It sure beats the hell out of this joint. No joke."}
{"text":"They place could use some remodeling but the food was amazing! My husband loved his gyro and my burger was so delicious."}
{"text":"My mom has taken me here since I was five years old and it's still the same. I never feel like I'm eating fast food and you actually get full of what you eat. I always get the Cheeseburger and chili cheese fries. And the service is always great. Does get busy but worth the wait because you're paying for quality."}
{"text":"New burger place in downtown Toronto. Two nearby locations are in Mississauga and Vaughn.  At the front of the store they have large posters featuring some of their burgers, which looks quite enticing. This sets my expectation on the presentation of their products.  They advertise Halal beef patties in their burgers. I'm still not sure what Halal means after someone explained to me that it's a method of preparing the animal before it is sent for processing, but as far as I'm concerned it is an effective marketing technique.  * * *  They have several different burger options. You can choose your toppings for each burger the way you like it. Several different sauces are available, including a \"Factory Sauce\" which they describe as mayo-based with some seasonings.  Sides include fresh-cut fries, poutine, tornado fries, and onion rings. They also offer 8-inch funnel cakes apparently.  Cutlery is available if you require. Forks and knives, no chopsticks.  * * *   I ordered The Machine with a side of fries. Waited about 10 minutes for the meal to come out. There were other people waiting, and they also take orders over the phone, but you can watch them grill your patty and put the burger together to pass the time.  The Machine is advertised as a 10oz double cheeseburger, with two 5oz patties between two buns. Of course, halal. It was definitely a large burger, but I was disappointed by the presentation: all of the contents were stacked together, rather than distributed throughout the body in some reasonable manner. In terms of burger construction, it could be arranged better.  But looks aside, for $11, you're getting a decent-sized burger with real ground beef. Patties are very juicy and the grilled ground texture makes it enjoyable to bite into. I ended up picking the burger apart pieces at a time with chopsticks because it was too big to handle in any civilized way.  Fries were kind of soft and had a strange flavour to it. Not sure what was going on there. As for halal meat...well, it didn't taste much different from other beef patties I've had.  * * *  Granted, while the burger I got was $11, they have burgers starting at 5.99 so if you're looking for a budget lunch, those aren't a bad deal given its location to downtown core."}
{"text":"Friends told me about this place so I checked it out absolute best cheeseburger I have ever had so juicy and hot every bite was awesome and the tornado fries were really good crispy and fresh. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Don't expect fine dining. If you want a nice, greasy burger, you really can't go wrong with this place. Also, they have a neon \"salads\" sign, and that's just pure awesome."}
{"text":"We tried to order online through ubereats, after spending the time trying to decide what to order, the order was rejected without explanation. Don't show yourself as open on ubereats if you aren't accepting orders."}
{"text":"I love Burger Factory!  It is my favorite burger place.  The burgers are so fresh, juicy and delicious!  I always go for the cheeseburger because it's the perfect size for me.    This place has it all!  Poutines, onion rings.  Philly cheese streaks.  And FUNNEL Cakes!  You gotta check this place out because you will not be disappointed.   It is right across the street from Vaughn mills and there are plenty of spots to sit and enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"The food is always exactly the way my son and I order it. (note....picky eaters, eat foods \"without\" a lot of the usual fare) and our orders have never been wrong. My one and only complaint is with the guys I assume own the place (Japanese....probably brothers?) they need to SMILE. Be friendly with your customers. It won't kill you, I promise!!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in Mississauga .. Philly steak sandwich simply amazing. Amazing variety of toppings .. place too small is the only drawback, otherwise they know their burgers very well."}
{"text":"A very cozy place with sticky table... Maybe they prefer to go orders. We ordered 1 regular burger and 1 cheese burger with fries and drink combos for just less than $20. I wanted to try their original burger flavour to see if there is something special to it. We waited for 35 mins before we got our order... The burger was good but not that great. It wasn't as juicy I thought it would be. I would buy my own meat and bbq  myself which will most likely turns out the same but cheaper (for a regular hamburger). Nothing special with fries and they cheap out when put them in tall box... half bottom box was empty.   Not a place I will take my kids... Maybe with friends who are burger lovers and wants to try different flavour burger."}
{"text":"The burgers here are good but you wait too long. Thats the real problem here. You see when you are either on your lunch break or on the run, I dont have the time to sit around and wait.  Its  a small place with a good idea and a good product but they either need to expand or become more efficient. Sorry but as i said, i just dont have all day to wait. That is the major problem  It would be a 5 star place if they had their act together and a few more tables, because the product is actually very good."}
{"text":"Decent burger.. But I've realized I need a blended burger vs 100% beef.  There's just not enough fat in the cut they're using and it comes out a bit dry.  If we could order them medium rare, then maybe (though I'm certain city code doesn't allow for it).  What concerned me more is the amount of flies in the place.. That's always a warning sign.  I did enjoy the fries though."}
{"text":"Ok It is my 2nd check in. Restaurant been renovated. I hate their black walls, black floors Like  it didn't reflect food factory as much as vehicles factory!   Their burgers is massively big mouth burger. We had 3 Juicy Lucy .. we finished the patty and almost no cheese inside ! Beef quality is normal good nothing special!   Pontine with black gravy and mozzarella cheese !!  Staff and manager were very nice and welcomed our comments and suggestions.   Baby high chair wasn't clean."}
{"text":"Me and the work crew eat here about once every couple of weeks, great food, huge portions. We have had the Philly steaks, burgers, and Mex dinners, that are all good. Fries are golden brown and you get a good size drink with the specials. This is a cash only establishment so bring a twenty. I call it in on the way then pick it up in the drive through and bring it back to the office, it's always a hit."}
{"text":"This is the original location for Burger Factory and the best location. Every item on their menu is amazing, but they are known for their juicy Lucy  which is a handmade burger patty stuffed with cheese! It is a melt, goody, delicious burger that you will definitely not forget! By far my favourite burger place......Hands down!"}
{"text":"A lot of people from work were hyping about this place and the food. This was my first time grabbing a burger from here. I decided to order the Chicken Fillet as I don't eat beef. Combo with Fresh Fries and a drink. The chicken fillet wasn't that good, the bun was soggy which made me lose my appetite. The toppings I chose were just lettuce, onions, factory sauce, & mayo. The factory sauce was good no complaints there. But the burger wasn't the best. Fries on the other hand were fresh and they gave us a lot of them. Many of the fries were tossed in the bag.   We did try the Funnel Cake as well. The funnel cake was amazing! I would say it was even better than the one from Wonderland. That's one thing I would definitely go back for!"}
{"text":"I Was craving a burger after work so decided to stop by here. I felt like having something simple so I just ordered cheeseburger with fries. It was a decent burger but I felt it was just a bit greasy. It wasn't bad but it felt a little bit underwhelming considering all the great reviews is read previously. But maybe it was on off day I will definitely go again and give them another try."}
{"text":"This was my first time and it was recommended to me by a coworker. The menu is overwhelming so I started with something you can not mess up. I ordered the taco salad,  chef salad, and their burger special, I will post the photos."}
{"text":"Best breakfast burrito in town hands down! I stop here all the time and it's consistently good."}
{"text":"This place is Kinda pricey but overall worth the money  Food is awesome and always fresh  My favourite is juicy Lucy on fire and the utility"}
{"text":"I've a friend I meet weekly for lunch and this is one of the places on our rotation. We invariably have the gyro combo. Portions of both meat and fries are generous and tasty. Occasionally, I'll get takeout at night and have the cheesesteak sandwich platter. Again, very generous and tasty. Decor is dated but that's not what you go for."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time the other day and got the gyro sandwich and omg!!!!!!!! Let me tell you it was the best one I've ever had!! They gave me a hot sauce on the side with it and it completed the meal perfectly! The guys that work there are really sweet also, I'll definitely be back for more"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the burger factory , I've been coming here for years already and I just wish I lived closer ."}
{"text":"Really really good food, especially the Juicy Lucy and the Utility. Fries and gravy are a must with any meal! Only issue is with the female order taker / cashier - I'm not being racist as I'm a different shade of brown but seems like if you're not her shade of brown the courtesy and manners are out the door. Her attitude needs an adjustment because this is a multi-cultural city and definitely bad business practice."}
{"text":"For years I have been going to the strip mall aka food court mall near the north west corner of Eglington and Dixie.  I've seen some businesses come and go through that time and because of that you get the new place every once in a while.  The Burger Factory has been here for a while now and although I hadn't been, I knew it was there.  The fact is this area of Dixie road between Eglinton and Matheson has MANY places to eat.  If I were a new business in this area with this much competition I'd probably be like, yikes!  Still it's a busy enough area to warrant the kind of dense concentration and saturation of restaurants I suppose.    The Burger Factory is part of the north end of the strip mall, opposite the long time mainstays like Bamiyan Kabob and Chang & Huang's which are on the south side.  My family just had an early dinner and Chang's and my brother was telling me that the Burger Factory has funnel cakes and that we should go for it as a group dessert.  I was like OK, sure.  That sounds like a plan.  A short walk across the parking lot brought us into the Burger Factory which seemed to be somewhat busy with people eating their burgers and some waiting for their take out.  Waiting in line allowed me to have a look at their menu which basically look like a nice selection of burger choices some of which look to be larger such as doubles and even triples.  One notable thing is that this place is Halal much like many of the other establishments in the surrounding area.  We had just eaten but looking at their selection I'd come back for a burger.  My brother ate there before and said it was good.  I'd probably be interested in that Juicy Lucy which is a Minneapolis thing, basically a burger stuffed with cheese that melts inside... yum!    Although we were just there for a funnel cake I didn't have to wait very long.  What an attractive serving.  With the strawberry topping and tax it came out to about 10 bucks.  Icing sugar, hot, crunchy, doughy and just plain good.  It was a perfect dessert to share after having a spicy and savory meal across the parking lot.  As for the burgers that'll have to be another visit but I'm already looking forward to it."}
{"text":"I love the best buy combo, this burger is better than anything you will get at mcds burger king etc and the fries are awesome"}
{"text":"So I walked in to order a breakfast burrito at 11:02 and was told it was passed 11:00 and could not get one. Well rules are rules, so I just went across the street to Eriberto's, they don't follow the rules there. ?"}
{"text":"At the mall with the fam and my son wanted a burger.  I tried Dairy Queen and the employee pointed me towards Burger Factory and said that was the only place to get burgers in the food court.  We ordered the kids meal.  It was a small burger, drink and fries.  Perfect for him.  The burger and fries were nothing special but they did the trick.  I would come back again if at the mall and the kids want a quick burger."}
{"text":"All of us were vegetarians and we ordered veggie burgers and fries. The burger was just minced veggies and a whole lot of oil and no flavour. The fires were OK. Too pricey for what we get. At half the price we can get good burgers at Harvey's or even Licks"}
{"text":"Love the poutine!!! I ordered.the juicy lucy and  make it as combo. You.must try the poutine. However the lucy was little bit dry."}
{"text":"food is great but service is slow. if you have a short lunch break you will probaly be late after going here."}
{"text":"Insane burger and you get a ton of good food for what you pay for. Exactly what I would expect from a hole in the wall type place. Not going to have ambience or anything else that you get from an actual restaurant so don't go with that expectation. It's more than a fast food place but less than a sit down restaurant. Classic burger joint (that happens to also have a bunch of other options as well) Had the King Kong burger and added avocado. It was great."}
{"text":"Such a good homemade burger place! I don't do McDonald's or those fast food burger places kause it's way too processed tasting! But burger factory does not at all taste processed!! On top of the flavor of the food..the service is not commercial!! It's so personable..like you're at your friends house getting a burger!!"}
{"text":"I have had Burger Factory bookmarked for the longest time.  Finally after more than a year I got around to trying it and let me tell you I was very disappointed.  Ordered 2 cheesy Lucy combos and added bacon.  The price was just over $30.00 so already that rang a bit of a bell for me.  I don't mind paying a bit more for something good so although $30 seemed high to me it wasn't that big of a deal.  We sat down and waiting almost half hour for our meal.  Now if it was busy then I can understand but there were only 2 people sitting in the restaurant on that Wednesday afternoon.  Again I don't mind waiting as long as its worth the wait in the end.  Upon receiving my order my first thing were to try the fries.  The fries were awesome.  Fresh cut, salted perfect and nice and crispy.  This made me even more excited to try the burger.  Upon opening the wrapped of the burger all I could see was a bun soaking in burger juice.  The bun became super soggy which was my first turn off.  For the price paid for that burger it was very small.  Burger was tasteless, bacon under cooked, bread soggy.  The middle of the patty was stuffed with cheese and was nice and melted as the pictures showed but didn't do much to help the taste.  After my meal was completed I had the nasty taste of plain unseasoned meat in my mouth for hours.  I give 2 stars only for the fries.  Very disappointed.  I could have caught them on a bad day but seeing how many burger joints I passed along the way to Burger Factory I wont be returning again."}
{"text":"Awesome place!! I love thier Jucy Lucy and Utility burgers. And thier poutine and funnel cake are must haves!!"}
{"text":"A bit overrated. The price is great for the portion BUT the food is bland bland bland. Zero seasoning on the fries and burger/grinders. Also if you like a crispy fry like I... pass. Soggy fries is their specialty.   Staff is friendly though"}
{"text":"Drive through or dine in. The drive-thru wait for your order can seem overlong. I'm a fan of their carne asada burritos and their chicken burritos - very tasty. Also their breakfast burritos. They use real tortillas, not gummy doughy ones like fast food joints use. All the burritos are huge - really two meals worth of food. But, they're not careful about removing gristle from the meat or excess liquid from the spoon before wrapping up your burrito. So if you're a picky eater or you don't like messy food, don't get any kind of burrito. Burgers and Philly cheese steak sandwiches are also pretty good. They have a big variety on the menu actually. It's a greasy spoon, and I do mean greasy, but was a weekly stop when I worked nearby."}
{"text":"# of Visits: 1 Date of last visit before review: 12/28/2013  3.5 stars (though I'm going to round down to 3 because I don';t think it deserves 4)   Ordered veggie burger, which was made of fava beans.  It had a nice crisp to it.  What I also liked was that they have a good choice of toppings and it's fully customizeable, which is great.    I think this is a decent burger place and better than your typical Harvey's, McD's, etc, but not super and nothing special.  Of course, I'm trying to stick to a primarily pescetarian diet these days, so I didn't have their meat burgers, but I see they have lots of options and they were fairly busy at 3 pm on a Saturday, so that's a good sigh.  Their beef is all fresh, ground in house and halal.    However, its worth noting that they have funnel cake (which I've never had before) and a 15 oz burger.  Verdict: If you live close by, eat halal meat, and want funnel cake or if you want a 15 oz burger, this place is right for you."}
{"text":"I would've only given Burger Factory 2 stars if it weren't for the service. My friend wanted to eat burgers for lunch and rather than going to our usual joint, I suggested we try a new place.   I ordered a cheeseburger with fries and a drink while my friend ordered a chicken burger only. I was expecting real cheddar cheese with my burger because the description of the burger said cheddar cheese so I was disappointed when I saw that they used processed cheese. Upon closer inspection of pictures of the burgers on the menu and window, the cheese they used was processed. I should've payed more attention.   The burger was pretty mediocre, I asked for relish in mine but I feel like there was way too much relish that I couldn't really taste the beef. My friend was also disappointed with her chicken burger and described the hamburger bun as \"grocery store\" type buns lol. The fries on the other hand, were pretty good. They were thick cut and perfectly crispy and salted right. The woman that took our order also prepared our order and she was nice enough to give my friend a complimentary side of fries.   Halfway through my meal, I noticed there was a strand of hair in my burger and proceeded to pick it out. Typically hair in my food doesn't bother me but this strand was embedded into the cheese... ewwww. After that I lost my appetite.   After this experience, I probably won't come back."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite breakfast place... ever!! The biggest and most amazing chorizo burrito I have ever had! Eggs, chorizo, cheese and hash brown in a huge tortilla. I have never been disappointed with this burrito. I live in Laveen and we drive over on saturday mornings to get this! I also love the burgers as well. I usually order the bacon cheeseburger... I love crispy bacon and that is exactly what you get! They are not cheap with the cheese either! Large portions, I suggest ordering the smaller fries...the small is huge! I love this place!   They do have a huge menu! Something for everyone....."}
{"text":"Along the lines of several other recent reviews, I wanted to love the burger factory but it just didn't wow me. We came in for the legendary breakfast burritos, but unfortunately we came in too late - they stop serving all breakfast items at 11a Monday through Friday and noon on Saturday.   We gave the burger meals a try instead, and they were not the worst I've had but they were extremely... underwhelming. There didn't seem to be any real seasoning on the burgers or the fries, and the meat patties are quite thin. It was an entirely forgettable burger. The fries were a little on the mushy side, and tasted almost a little freezer burned. Again not the worst I've ever had, but just not something I'd come back for.   I will say that the staff was super friendly and helpful though, and they have an extensive menu, so they get a couple of stars just for that!   PSA: the restrooms are dodgy. Don't come here planning to take a luxurious bathroom break!!   I might come back again some day to try the breakfast burritos, but only on the off chance that I'm out and about before noon on Saturday!"}
{"text":"This place was good but I wouldn't categorize it as amazing with the best burger I've ever had for that you have to go to downtown and either get food from Burgenator or Ozzie's. The food was good did you see Lucy was delicious but there was not too much cheese on the inside of the burger. I got the Philly cheesesteak was just called the utility that was delicious but very wet and soaked up the entire bread. I've been here a few times and the food is good it's OK for a burger place in the suburbs but nothing spectacular. They should definitely offer some more options and I thought that the burgers were a bit dry on the inside."}
{"text":"I ordered the utility combo and they forgot my fries and drink. Also the bread from the sandwich was soggy. I got it delivered and when I called them to tell them I'm missing items they first just said so like they didn't care then they blame the new staff that they hired. The food is also overpriced. Never again will I order from here, and I'll make sure to tell everyone not to order from here."}
{"text":"Food is good, however every time I've gone the staff makes me feel like I'm putting them out by being there."}
{"text":"I always wondered about this place but was hesitant to go because of the negative reviews. That said, shame on you Yelpers for being so damn high maintenance when going to what amounts to a burger counter.  Go to Saint Francis and get a fancy burger served by a hipster if that's your thing, don't expect it here. All right, moving along, the burgers were tasty, this was a good place to take my parents and 15 month old daughter. Very unpretentious and low-key, I thought this was a sit-down and be served place because so many people complained about the service (mostly about the bar service); however, you order at a counter and they call your name when your food is ready. While I'm a foodie at heart, my parents aren't adventurous eaters and, due to nap logistics, quick and easy burgers were just what we needed. I'd come back for sure, the restaurant was clean and it was packed by the time we left (Friday lunchtime). Don't expect something that this place isn't; you want gourmet, go somewhere else. You want excellent sports bar service, go somewhere else--not a burger lunch counter."}
{"text":"Always consistent and so yummy ! My husband and I love this place and the regular staff are so amazing.. Super friendly and they remember us every time we come in. I hope they keep everything the same. It's so simple and so good ! Cheeseburger with double cheese is the best."}
{"text":"I've only been here for lunch but based on some reviews regarding breakfast I may be missing something.  The first time I went in here I was kind of overwhelmed by all the choices. It didn't make it any easier trying to decipher the menu plastered above the grill area, that was kind of awkward. I'm not certain if they have a paper menu.  I struck up a conversation with a regular and he pointed me to the Gyros special. I ordered that and didn't really dig it too much. The next trip I tried the pastrami and was not too impressed. Both meals BTW, were ginormous. Next, I said to myself if this was an IQ Test and you had to choose something from a place that was called the BURGER Factory what should you choose? Burger, dummy. Yes, I tried a burger the next time through and liked it. So I would rate the burgers a 4 and the rest of the stuff a 2 to average out to a 3 star rating for the total body of work.  Also, they take credit cards. So this is not a cash only place."}
{"text":"anytime I play at hidden house, you can find me pregaming here. the frisco burger is to die for, and for that reason, ive never eaten anything else there...lol"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night and the place was packed. We were kinda worried where we would sit once our food was ready. We managed to snatch a table as it became free.   I ordered the triple cheeseburger and it was great.  The only big issue we had, and this went for all 5 of us, is our sides were cold by the time we got them. Tornado fries, poutine, and onion rings. All cold.  Cost $40 for a big burger with a poutine and a Philly cheesesteak sandwich and tornado fries and two cans of pop. Typical for a specialty burger joint.  They just need to time the cooking of your food so your burgers aren't piping hot and sides ice cold."}
{"text":"Don't know why I stopped here! I was looking for something to eat, noticed the establishment, and a burger sounded good. So I pull up to order and once again, like I always do! I ordered something that I didn't stop here for!! So I ended up ordering their chili cheese fries w/onion.  Service: There were no one else in the drive through, all I ordered was the chili cheese fries. It took them over 15 min to get the order out! Don't know why, but this seems to be a long wait to me? Food: Well, let me put it this way for you! A) should have just driven by and continued to find something else. B) Should have ordered what I wanted in the first place! Chili fires were to greasy and not enough flavors. I love my chili, but this could have passed as a chili sauce. I'm not trying to say this is the worst place around, but I will have second thoughts of coming back here. And If I ever do? I will not try their chili fries again."}
{"text":"Burger is good but the service is extremely pathetic. Stingy attitude, if you ask for a tissue they will head count and give tissue. Very disappointing. Typical!!!"}
{"text":"The burger itself is pretty bland and the fries are nothing special.  Considering how long it takes for your order to be ready, it is not worth the wait.  I'd consider this a very average, run of the mill burger joint."}
{"text":"Mouthwatering, thick, steaming, juicy, fresh meat patties... Are perfect descriptions of the burgers you'll see pictures of on the walls of this establishment. Quite the opposite from what you'll actually get once you receive a burger from their menu. I spent the majority of my lunch break trying to find the perfect angle to take to avoid cutting my beautiful lips on their razor sharp patties. Meat so thin, they could make a serious run on Americas next top model. They've got quite a bit of other food on their menu... But Why would anyone bother with Mexican of Greek food when you can't get a burger right? Quit being cheap, get better meat or change the name. This is one burger factory that needs a recall."}
{"text":"Burger factory is a must. The burger combo is priced good for a large amount of food and they give a load of fries. THE BURGERS ARE THE BEST!!! Now I'm going to be thinking of burger factory until I have my fix, tomorrow lunch time perhaps or dinner."}
{"text":"I went through the drive through at lunch time on a weekday- don't do that here!  The time swallowed up my entire lunch break- seriously I was there for 25 minutes waiting and idling in the drive through (gas ain't cheap!).  The owner parks in tandem in the other lane (see picture) so you're blocked in if someone's behind you, and so you can't bail if it's taking too long and want to go somewhere else.  The food was good, the wait was just too long to not make it worth the trip.  Zero stars for the wait plus 4 stars for the food leaves my review of this experience at 2 stars."}
{"text":"Their burgers are super juicy, but their philly steaks are amazing!!! The bun is mouth watering and the meat is very tender. I highly suggest trying this.  Their restaurants a bit small and tables don't really move so if you have a group greater than 4 you'll have to split up the tables. But still a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Poor service is what you get when you come here. The food may be good, but expect to wait exceptionally long for a basic burger and fries. Also the female server who served us was extremely rude and overcharged us. No apology or acknowledgement of her mistake."}
{"text":"I'm always happy to find a burger place that is more artisan than \"frozen puck\" based.  I stopped in for a quick lunch at a location close to Chatime for convenience.  I took a chance on a burger called \"The Machine\" which I coupled with an order of Tornado Fries.  The burger was good, somewhat dry-- a notch below Burger's Priest, Holy Chuck and South Street.  The Tornado Fries were a nice change however.  Rather than spiral cut, this was a thinly sliced potato with the slices lined up on a skewer, deep fried and salted.  Definitely better than most traditional french fries, and equal to a spiral cut version at your local ribfest.  With no other clearly homemade burger joint nearby, I would come again."}
{"text":"Very messy burgers but fun. I'm not a stacked to the sky condiments type of guy but a decent burger for $7 and WAY BETTER then the chains. They serve Halal too. Small place but worth a visit."}
{"text":"Awesome food: breakfast burritos, salads (especially the Greek), pork tenderloin sandwhich, grilled chicken sandwich, the Cosmopolitan (which reheats really well when you cannot eat the entire thing), grilled cheese, french fries (nice and thick, good with gravy), the list goes on..."}
{"text":"My wife has been raving about these burgers for a couple months now, a regular lunch destination for her and her friends.  We were out n about running errands today and she had the brilliant idea to stop here for a quick lunch.  I ordered the bacon avacado burger (no cheese please) at her recommendation, she had the sourdough burger, and Vinnie (our roomate/adopted son) had the King Kong burger - no fries today.  My burger was delicious!  Lot of tomato, lettuce and avacado, a nice juicy beef patty and a good bun, thoughtfully cut in half for easy eating.  I loved it, but could only eat half... good thing vinnie was there!  Of course I had a bite of her burger and it was also delicious, in fact I will be ordering that next time!  I didn't sample Vinnie's burger cuz that would be wierd... but lets just say the name does not lie!  2 beef patties, cheese, lettuce, tomato (Vinnie says \"fuck that\"), pickles, pastrami, topped off with a generous helping of bbq beef.  WOW... he finished it, then I offered him the other half of my avacado burger... which he reluctantly ate... well not that reluctantly.  Hehe... he said he could've eaten more but was satisfied.    I will be going back - gotta have the rest of the family try this... YUM!"}
{"text":"I've been here once and the food was decent. However the last three times I've tried to go here they haven't opened on time. I was here about 15 minutes after they opened each time and the doors are locked, no lights on, and no one answers the phone. Very unprofessional. If you can't open on time change your hours, or hire employees who show up on time."}
{"text":"Milton location Ok it's new  Ok so there will be growing pains Ok so the bearded hipster's pant are falling off  Ok I get it  What is obvious immediately is there is very little training. Didn't seem to have a system or the system was certainly nit a great one. You would think,one person is grilling, another is doing the fries , another is wrapping and serving...... not quite  Everyone bumping around each other and not communicating or calling out to each other, and no leading the team  Order took forever, 3 people standing around looking at the cold remnants of fries , anyone think to put on fresh ones? Place was packed! No the call was to give us cold fries. Really that's the best call? Anyway we ended asking for fresh ones  The burger was ok, was thin and fairly salty, Bun was good which is a surprise, but all in all not a great burger especially compared to Five Guys , but not as expensive as them. There operation should be a training example for sure. All in all could have been much better, maybe trainer prior to opening? In time I'm sure it will be better But if I'm going down the greasy burger rabbit hole  I'll pick something else in the future!  N"}
{"text":"suprisingly good! I am from California and miss Tam's burgers :( came in here ordered a bacon avocado cheeseburger. DELISH! service is okay not bad. actual place is ehh. but the food makes it worth it!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Not too busy in the evening. Had a cheese burger. Tasted good. The french fries were good as well."}
{"text":"Ok so I decided to give this place a second try and so far so good.  The was an employee actually at the front stand today and she was nice.  As most of you all know I am the king of burgers.  The burger was ok.....to much bread for my taste"}
{"text":"I loved this place! I'm not a huge burger fan but my family is and all 5 of them also loved it here! This place gets super busy and now I see why! Prices were a bit pricey but then again so is everything in mountain view! Even though it was busy we got great service. Really cool atmosphere and live the set up of this place! Everyone sits at one big table basically! It's a tight squeeze but its bc everyone wants to be there. I would definitely come back on the regular if I had the money so since I don't it will have to be less often!"}
{"text":"Food was OK. I have had better burgers elsewhere in Toronto. I had the Machine (2 patties) with beef bacon (their replacement of bacon), lettuce, mayo and tomatoes. The combo came out to approximately 16 bucks.  The inside is fairly clean, but they don't have too many people manning inside, so the tables were somewhat messily wiped. For some reason, my food came out a notch slower than the rest, but that wasn't a problem. Fries were good and didn't need me to add any salt at all. The fries were thick cut.   Burger itself was alright, but I didn't like the mayo nor was the patty able to withstand the juices from the burger, so it fell apart midway.  Note: The location of this place is is on the SOUTHEAST corner of the plaza beside the Freshii / Yang's. It is NOT on the North side in between the TD and  Montana's as per Yelp / Google Maps."}
{"text":"My wife and I went our of our way to go to Burger Factory to get a pastrami sandwich.  When we tried to eat them, they were so tough, full of sinew/gristle that we could not chew them.  I took them back to the manager, challenging him with one of the pieces of pastrami to try to chew through it, or possibly make a belt out of it.  It was that tough!  We will not be going back."}
{"text":"I'd been once before and did the drive through. A chef/colleague said that it's his favorite burger joint in town. My first experience was good but I wasn't blown away. Bacon cheeseburger with all the fixin's and fries. Good.  I tried again since I was craving a burger while running errands and went inside this time. Service is excellent. Neat little set up though dated and HUGE menu. Prices seemed reasonable but toward the higher end of fast food fare.  This time I ordered a patty melt with bacon, to go. Ate it in the car. It was good, but again I wasn't blown away. Rye bread was grilled well but didn't have any pop. Burger was well done, and I understand that, especially for a thin patty. Melty American cheese. Standard. Grilled sweet onions. Standard. But the patty was a bit dry, maybe chewy, not like a juicy patty but a little rubbery I guess.  Overall it was good. I'd go again if I'm in the area. I'm interested to try some other menu items to maybe get a more rounded experience. But if you're called the Burger Factory, it's likely best to focus on the burger instead of trying to do everything else. Just my opinion."}
{"text":"Honestly this place was surprisingly...not bad!  A notch below burgers priest/ holy chuck is a very good placement/rating of this establishment on the Toronto burger rankings.   I wouldn't come here if I were in a rush, they take their time with making their burgers, much like Burger's Priest and Holy Chuck.  The burger itself was a good balanced burger. It was not greasy but not dry. However, the patty wasn't very flavourful, almost bordering on bland.  The Tornado Potato was pretty good, but it was a tiny bit soggy/oily. They got our orders right, and the burgers tasted good, but it is missing *something* maybe it was too quiet in here, or maybe it was the lack of anything super interesting or absurd on their menu--- at least nothing that hasn't already been done by another burger chain recently.  Items were pretty standard, prices are pretty standard.   Recommended if you've got like 45-60 mins to eat and a serious non-McD's burger craving."}
{"text":"Holy portion size.  Getting my hair cut when the old food catching receptacle started to grumble.  Yelped \"Burgers\" hot damn, this place is across the street.  Food and fries were made to order.  Had the King Kong special $10.  Two parties, ham, pastrami, letty, 'mato, and 1000 island dressing.  All I can say is it was all yummy, under $10 and the service was solid.  Try it."}
{"text":"Great tasting burgers. Prices are in par with value and quality. Service is extremely friendly and welcoming.  They should just change the bread because it can't handle the compressor sandwich."}
{"text":"Perfect burgers and fries are amazing really potatoes. The service is friendly staff. Also try the philly cheese steak, it's very meaty."}
{"text":"went through the drive thru at about 130 in the afternoon. I ordered a cheeseburger and fries. The fries were pretty good but the burger was all lettuce and little meat. They also have that cheap runny ketchup that doesnt add much to the fries. Probably wont go back"}
{"text":"Halal meat is served here, per signs on the restaurant. Went here recently for lunch after Jummah.  Tight space inside for seating.  Tried the \"Juicy Lucy on Fire\" which is a Halal Beef Patty stuffed with Mozarella Cheese and Jalapenos.  Also had Poutine on the side. Everything was very good.  The only thing which was slightly off was the bun, it was not strong enough for all the toppings and juiciness so got pretty soggy at the bottom.  If they are able to get better (stronger) buns, then this would be a near perfect burger!  The prices are a little on the high side, but the burgers are huge, so you do get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Would like to clarify based on another review: this restaurant is NOT in the \"hood\" at all.    Went here for brunch. The food is good, fresh, and huge portions for the price! I had an avocado bacon cheeseburger with fries, my boyfriend had a gyro plate. Only complaint is the fries, they're very bland. The staff was friendly. The place was clean & conveniently located. Overall, I would return here."}
{"text":"They have THE BEST CHICKEN BURRITO EVER!! Ask them to add a jalapeño to it. It gives it a spicy kick to it. Plus the price is very reasonable. It not on the menu board but it's on the paper menu.   Trust me you have to try it!  I'll be back to fulfill my chicken burrito cravings. :)"}
{"text":"Good food ! But the lady in the drive through window has a bad attitude! I've been there a few times and she has a bad customer service attitude every time .I would have given more stars if it wasn't for her ."}
{"text":"Excellent and freshly grilled burgers. Better than hero burger for sure. Not to great.  Seating area very casual."}
{"text":"Ordered a combo burger which comes with a regular drink. The drink they provided was small or maybe even extra small. After asking the staff they said that that is their regular size.  Whatever. I feel ripped off and will never return to these guys.  You have been warned ....."}
{"text":"When it's 11PM in Mississauga on a Sunday night I usually get stuck stopping at either Pizza Nova or Pizza Pizza, which isn't a terrible thing, but sometimes it's just not what I want. Luckily, I stumbled across the Burger Factory and it has officially changed everything! When I came in the place had a group of people and it took the employee a few minutes to acknowledge me, but hey, she was alone and she had burgers to make so I ain't mad. I ended up ordering a cheeseburger with onions, ketchup, tomato, and lettuce. I expected a pretty basic bland burger but what I got was an absolutely delicious, scrumptious, and juicy piece of meat between 2 patties that left me kind of sad I didn't get a second for the next day! This place is a little more expensive then some of the other fast burger places, but it's also a better quality burger. This place definitely far exceeded my expectations and I can't wait to come back again to try a different style of burger!"}
{"text":"If you want twice as much gyro meat on your gyro sandwich than anywhere else in Phoenix that I've had one, come here. And I also had their garden salad and the ranch dressing is fantastic, not out of a bottle..and they gave me two dressings without me asking. Also their prices are very good. I'm so tired of paying dinner prices for lunches in other sit down restaurants. This is fast and very casual and you order at the counter. I feel like it's nice and clean too. I'm also impressed by their generosity. My gyro actually had a good amount of meat on it, and I've had it several times and it's always been the same. Pita bread is nice and fresh, and the taziki sauce seems homemade and is generously slathered on and the salad and tomatoes are fresh. Big enough to share except my husband wanted to know if I wanted the last 1/3 of my half...ha! Only drawback is the atmosphere...a bit cold and only functional. My review is for the Gyro, which is the only thing I've had."}
{"text":"I ordered the cheese burger - no spicy, no onion plus regular fries. The burger was juicy and very tasty. The fries were also yummy and very few crispy ones. I was very pleased with my meal. I also ordered the mini funnel cake fully loaded. I love the fact that I could order a small sized dessert instead of something far too large to end the meal. The funnel cake was nicely covered in sauce and the cake itself was perfectly cooked. The employees were super nice and personable. Great experience, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is not worth their shitty customer service. Every time I order they act like I'm bothering them. The last time I was there with my boss she found a hair in her burger. She went to the counter very discreetly and asked for a new burger and they gave her an attitude. If you want a far superior burger with better service go to Wine Burger on 19th ave just north of Bethany on the east side of the street."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went on a late Saturday afternoon to have lunch, visiting and trying it out for the first time. Cozy atmosphere and staff were pleasant. Many menu choices but not overwhelming. I had the Hamburger and he had The Machine and we shared a poutine. The burgers tasted really good, meat was flavourful and a decent size. Our first time having halal. Good choices of condiments and toppings for the burger. Such a simple burger but so good. Simplicity at its best! Poutine was really good as well, just needed the cheese to melt a little bit more. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"How did my Bacon Avocado Burger Combo cost more than the King Kong Burger Combo???  First time in and I apparently ordered the most expensive item on the menu.  Burger and fries were pretty good, but for over $11 at a fast food joint it better be good.  Burger patty is pretty thin."}
{"text":"First time in a while at the mall. Nephew picked this place to eat. Owner was very friendly and answered all our questions about the menu. Nephew got the BBQ burger, my son had the kids chicken tenders meal and I grabbed the slider trio. Amazing food! Never thought pineapple would taste good on a burger. I'm glad I was wrong. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"Good decent burger, good flavour, clean place. Now you wonder why the 3-stars. It's not the best, and it's not out-of-this-world. It reminded me of Big Moe's. I guess from the name and the previous comments, i expected a lot. Which it wasn't. Either way, the burger was good, flavourful, juicy and cooked fresh. Will i come here again? Sure and will try the funnel cake"}
{"text":"Now I can go through life saying that I have tried a King Kong Burger. As the name implies, it is no simple single patty between two hamburger buns. It is two patties with cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickle, ham, pastrami, and \"1000 spread.\" The burger was cut into two parts and each half was probably about 6 inches wide. Even squeezing the buns from top to bottom, it was difficult to cram everything into one bite, but I managed to do okay. So was it any good? I'll have to admit that it was decent, but wasn't really phenomenal like I was hoping. Maybe it was the fact that it had what are typically deli meats with it. Or maybe it was that the burger patties were a very small portion of the overall burger so it tasted more like a deli sandwich with hamburger meat slightly tucked into it.  I ended my meal thinking it was decent, but not really having any burning desire to want to order it again in the future. As for the restaurant itself, the employees were polite.  They got our order correct and a few could be observed cleaning the place. I wouldn't mind returning to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Burgers were good. Avoid the veggie burger!  The guy taking the orders was having an off day - got my order wrong, gave me wrong toppings, side, and extra drink. Paid for it all, not a huge deal, but nothing too special."}
{"text":"Food is good but dont use the coupon they cheat they only hive 2 dollars offf and  not the 5 . Upo  asking they said it was the tax but when i said taz was 13% they changed and said u can pay yhe full price....."}
{"text":"#YELPGTA #YELPBURGER #YELPBURGERBINGE #JUICYLUCY  I've known this place to be around. Never thought I'd ever visit it because it isn't appealing on the outside - small and overcrowded, always. However, surprise surprise, this made it to the top of my to-try list for the Yelp Burger Binge week. And boy, am I glad!   Burger Factory is a small joint as mentioned above, with little seating and I can't honestly say it's the cleanest. Avoid washrooms. The service is slow. I don't have anything positive to note about this place other than the Juicy Lucy burger. It was quite the burger! Some places advertise cheese stuffed patties but you never really see the cheese?! Juicy Lucy is quite different. One bite and there's cheese oozing out of the lovely tender patty. It's a wonderful sight, and you really taste it. My friend complained that halal is always a little dry - but the cheese really made a difference!   Clearly, I am a fan. And I'll be back!"}
{"text":"A local burger joint that's been around for as long as I can remember. Sometimes it's hard to pick out what to eat since there are a billion items on their menu.  The last time I went, I ordered the sourdough double cheese burger with bacon and avocado.  How was it? It was as if a sourdough jack made a beautiful baby with a BLT. Grilled sourdough with 2 burger patties, american cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato and generous portions of avocado. One word, amazing.  I've also had the gyro here, which was better than My Big Fat Greek Restaurant IMO."}
{"text":"Good food. Ok service. Place is congested though. Burgers are not the greatest but decent for the money."}
{"text":"This little place is hidden in a rundown like plaza by Dixie and Eglinton. Unless you have heard about this place and wanted to try it out, it is very easy to miss and drive by.  Despite the small restaurant, they still have lots of seatings available for people who wants to withstand the heat. Bonus, they have tv's and at the time was showing \"just for laugh\" to keep you occupied while you wait for you order.  Lucky me its burger week and found the nearest participant burger joint to work. Burger factory is it and off I go. The deal is the Lucy Burger. One of their signature burger I supposed, but I don't really know what the history or description of this burger since I had to put my own toppings on it anyway. So to me it's a burger from burger factory :)  For one burger, it was a long wait, I was there for a long time. But I still waited. Fast forward to my office, this Lucy burger was equipped with a big burger patty, lettuce, mayo, relish, sirracha and the must try burger factory sauce. The presentation is sloppy, it fell apart as I took my first bite and hot sauce all over my hand. Was it delicious, it wasn't heavenly but good enough for me to finish and wipe it clean. Beware thou have yourself a fork and knife.  Was it worth the wait, I don't think so. The presentation is a turn off and the toppings was sloppy. I would suggest a harder bread that would sustain itself after the toppings are place so it doesn't breakdown. Sloppy burger just doesn't do it do it for me, but might be really good for others. I definitely recommend if one wants a fatty burger with loaded of sauces.  #burgerbingeweek #yelpgtaBBW #Yelpburgerbinge"}
{"text":"Yikes!  So I've been meaning to stop into Burger Factory for a while, because I love hamburgers and it's very close to my work. And although Burger's Priest is closer, I figured I should check the place out to see if the Priest has anything to worry about.  It doesn't.  I walked in, and while there were three people working behind the counter, it took a minute or two for anyone to take my order. Not the best sign. I decided to go with their lunch special, which is a classic burger topped with lettuce, tomatoes, onion, mayo, and ketchup.  One of the cooks pulled out a ball of ground beef and pressed it onto the grill, so I figured I was probably in pretty good hands.  Not so much.  After about five minutes of waiting, I looked over at the grill again to see what was going on and I noticed the cook pressing the meat down. Hard. The patty looked almost charred at this point, but still, I had faith that he knew what he was doing.  He didn't.  He finished preparing the burger, wrapped it up, and placed it on a tray. I figured he'd immediately call my number, but he just went right back to cooking more food. The dude who took my order was oblivious as well, and though I was tempted to say something, I figured that I was writing this review, so I might as well be accurate about the service.  It took several minutes before they finally called my number. I picked up my burger and went back to a table to eat. And after all that, was it worth the wait?  It wasn't. It really, really wasn't.  This now ranks as one of the driest hamburgers I've ever eaten. Any and every trace of moisture had been steadily sucked out of the patty by the massive overcooking by the chef. I exerted a lot of jaw power chewing every bite as a result.  Making matters worse, the cook had completely oversalted the patty. So not only was it dry as heck, it was a salt bomb. It was truly, truly gross.  Needless to say I shan't be returning. Burger's Priest is a better option if you're in the area (obviously); heck, the burger at the nearby Scotiabank Theatre is better, and that's done with a frozen patty!  Hang your head in shame, Burger Factory."}
{"text":"Juicy Lucy on Fire. Great name for a burger.  I wouldn't consider the burger really hot, but i am a fan of spicy foods so your mileage may vary. The burger was well prepared, nicely seasoned and of course juicy, but not too much so.  The fries were thicker cut than you normally see.  At first thought the fry portion was small, but I ended up reasonably full after the meal.  I guess girth does factor in. Place was clean and the staff friendly, overall an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"The Burger Factory! I usually order the swiss mushroom burger or the bacon burger with fries and a drink and it's always under $9. The bacon on the burger could be better but the mushrooms on the swiss burger are delicious. I have gotten them with onion rings before and sweet potatoe fries and I approve them all! The onion rings could debatably be the best ones I have had.  The owner Isahbell is so sweet and knows customer service, she is very passionate about her restaurant in the food court and is excited when she is launching new food. For instance she just added hot wings and yes they are actually HOT and fresh! But when you order the wings call them in because they take 15 minutes - just like any other wing place.  I put 4 stars here because when I come to the mall I only eat here now, but I wouldn't drive to the mall just for it."}
{"text":"I waited nearly 30 minutes for a burger and fries combo as it appears that this place is too understaffed for a fast food joint.  This was disappointingly the crunchiest burger I ever had.  It felt like I was eating a falafel instead with hamburger buns.  Strangest meat I ever tasted since the lunches I had in space camp when I was a kid.  That's right, space camp..."}
{"text":"The burgers are made fresh, all natural, without any preservatives or taste booster. Tastes good... nothing amazing, but definitely good.  The place is bit crampy. ...and as almost all the seating places are near the open cooking area, it's better to leave your jackets and handbags in your car, unless you want those to smell like food and smoked meat  :-)"}
{"text":"I have been eating at burger factory since I was 10 years old. My family used to go to a hair place next door a couple times a month. I am pretty sure I have only ever gotten the chicken salad with ranch or the onion rings. They are so good ... Ooh and the mushrooms and cheese sticks. Moved to LA for 3 years, come back today and it's the same amazing salad, same excellent service. I have never had a single bad experience in  the 12+ years I have been going ! Quite possibly the best ranch in the world ! ! I am a restaurant manager in Scottsdale  and have worked in many high end restaurants and  this hole in the wall is one of my fave spots. Keep killing it !!!"}
{"text":"Date of Visit 8/4 4:30pm  It's actually much more than a burger shop, as they have Mexican food, greek items, & subs on their menu.  I went with their burger & 32 oz. drink special.  The fries were good, the burger was huge!  The place on the interior does need updating, but this is a good place if you want a burger with good customer service."}
{"text":"Really yummy burger joint. Definitely order ahead as there is a major wait time for any type of order. Did the cheese stuffed burger (cheesy Lucy) and it tasted amazing! Fries were excellent also! No complaints with the food, just make sure you order ahead to ensure you're not waiting 20 or more minutes for food."}
{"text":"Variety variety variety!!!! Their menu is huge they have everything to meet your appetite. Fast and friendly service food didn't take that long even through they were busy. Also they are OPEN on Saturdays for some reason yelp said they are closed but I saw cars in the parking lot and went in"}
{"text":"I am so so sad it look me this long to discover this place. Burger factory is definitely the best burger place in sauga town! Before I get into talking about their delicious burger, let me just say their mouth watering big fat juicy fries are just the best! Don't forget to get their factory sauce on the side, its a match made in heaven!   So last but not least, their juicy Lucy on fire is foodgasmic. The meat is nice and tender, their huge selection of sauces and toppings make the experience unforgettable. The only thing that can make this burger perfect is if they use cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella.   Overall, its my new favourite burger place, halal never tasted so good!"}
{"text":"Great service, family owned and very clean place.  However the food is horrible. Cheaply made and prepared. I got really sick last night and had horrible stomach pain this morning. Don't eat here!"}
{"text":"I get their avocado burger with no lettuce every time I'm in the neighborhood. The bread on these burgers totally makes them. Tons of avocados. Very tasty! The drive thru service can be a little less than friendly, but as long as they give me my burger, I'm happy! I always use my debit card, but the order has to be greater than $5."}
{"text":"This little burger shop replaced McDonalds at the Galleria Mall, and while it's not a known chain, we have never been disappointed coming here. The service was prompt and friendly. They have turkey burger patties in addition to beef, and delicious teriyaki and BBQ choices for the burgers. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend to get a burger. Tried the juicy Lucy with jalapeño and like it's name says it was juicy and really tasty, but there wasn't a lot of heat in the burger. I also got the combo with the fries and they were thick cut fries. It is a good place to eat but t me it was nothing special."}
{"text":"It's in the \"hood\" and always crowded so we had to try it. Their menu is very big from breakfast on.   The food was good, the staff awesome and a comfortable place to sit.   Looking for a burger/sandwich or combo hit this place up. It's good!"}
{"text":"They always burn/overcook the burgers, if you like a extremely well done (burnt) burger this is your place :/"}
{"text":"Went thru drive thru so can't really relate the inside to everyone. Their drive thru machine needs a little updating , its very hard to hear and its mainly due to the machine . they have one big menu , there is alot to choose from , they have burgers , Mexican food, Greek items. Subs its much more than a burger shop. Now the first thing I tired were their shakes and I have to give them credit Oreo shakes are not on menu but its 100 percent worth getting . I ordered two chili burgers and large fries to split. Let me tell you its a lot of food. The chili burger was really good , they actually attempted and succeed to make a chilli burger . usually at some low end burger places , you get a very low end can chili but this place did it right. Also large fries are large fries and they are delicious. I have to give this place credit on the outside its not fancy but it is worth the trip for burger. I will have to come back to try more of their massive menu. Also the burger is on the level of a five guys burger but they have more options in types of burgers."}
{"text":"- Ordered \"Juicy Lucy\" combo - Took about 15 minutes - Good portions. I was thoroughly full. - Patty was not salted so better to put the sauces and topping to get some taste - Cheese in the middle of patty a good touch - If you are into burgers, this is a good place - A little on the expensive side @ $11+ per combo"}
{"text":"Had the compressor and it was pretty good. Bun was not too thick and beef tasted fresh. Burger was actually very hot to eat so had to be careful. Solid flavour. Wish they had malt vinegar. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great local burger joint. I was a little concerned that the menu was so diverse that they wouldn't be able to do anything well but they do a really good job of delivering flavorful foods with great ingredients. My fiance ordered the breakfast burrito with chorizo and bacon and I ordered a burger combo. Everything was very tasty and the portions are huge! They are very generous with fries so be sure to share an order. This is not your traditional hipster upscale burger place so don't have that expectation, it is however a solid burger joint in the heart of central Phoenix."}
{"text":"A 'Burger Factory' you say?  Am I to understand that this is a factory that produces burgers?  Away post-haste!  Right down the street from work (everything is right down the street from work) is The Burger Factory, a place that fills my head with visions of little burgers riding down a conveyor belt.  First comes the bottom bun, then a machine delicately places a few drops of sauce on it, then another machine spreads it with precision, then the next robot arm gently places a patty, then next one puts the lettuce on top of that, then another one puts on the onions, the next robotic arm is poised to place bacon if needed, then comes the cheese machine, then the last machine places a top bun on it and pats it lovingly.  Then the complete burger continues its ride on the conveyor belt to a final machine which quickly and accurately boxes the burger, then stamps it with an 'ACME' stamp.  Bugs Bunny takes the boxed burger over to a drive thru window and gives it to the customer... ok, i'm bored at work doing stupid spreadsheets, so my mind is wandering!  Anyway, you don't get to see Bugs Bunny, but you do get food prepared with precision and quality assurance.    First, I was impressed with the number of items on the menu.  A varied variety of various burgers, some sandwich staples, Mexican food, greasy spoon dinners, and even breakfast.  Whether or not they do all of these categories well...I vow to find out and report.  So far, I've had a Philly Cheese Steak and a gyro from here.    I haven't been satisfied with a cheese steak in a very long time, but the Factory has come the closest to getting it right for me.  Tender meat, gooey cheese, and enough of it.  Peppers and onions were grilled to carmelized goodnes.  And the bread was even good.  The taste was right on point...the perfect balance of savory and sweet and devilish.  It wasn't a little boy's size, either.  I got full.  The gyro?  If anyone has ever read my reviews of gyro joints, they know I love the things more than I love my family.  Factory's gyro was...big.  That's the most memorable thing about it.  The taste was just average.  Not bad at all, but it doesn't rank in MY top 5.  Its got everything that a gyro should have...meat, onions, sauce, pita.  And lots of it all.  But like I said, the taste is only ok.  Ah, I need to get over myself I think.  Most people would find this gyro superb.  When a place has you looking forward to coming back and trying more, they've pretty much done their job.  These guys are quick with the orders and the price is not too bad at all...I'd say a complete lunch for about 8 bucks?  I like that they are open early for breakfast, because my only other options are McDonald's, The Good Egg (waaaaay too expensive), and some other places that I probably have yet to discover in this area.  Hopefully, I'll be trying their breakfast soon as they offer all the omletes that I like, and pancakes, too.  I think this is one of those places that you keep trying stuff on the menu until you come accross something you really don't like, then you just stick with what's been good to you."}
{"text":"There are precious few places you can still eat lunch for ~$5.  Burger Factory is one of them.  I normally get the burger special; a good sized burger, fries and a supertanker of a soda complete with all the refills you can stand.  The burgers are usually pretty tasty, complete with 1000 Island dressing.  The fries are usually fresh.  They carry Pepsi products, including my personal favorite, Cherry Pepsi.  It's a cheap lunch, complete with entertainment; an older gentleman of Asian descent works there, I take him to be the owner.  I happen to take great pride in being a crabby SOB, but this guy beats me hands down.  He's actually a really nice guy, once you get to know him.  But, watching him deal with people who are overwhelmed by the menu in the middle of the lunch rush would be worth the price of admission, even if the food wasn't so good.  The building is a little old, the decor is outdated.  But, if you work in the area, I can't recommend highly enough that you give it a whirl.  If you go in expecting an inexpensive, fast-food lunch you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is prepared right in front of you and the price is very economical.    They serve American breakfasts and any sandwich you can think of.  I like. Their enchiladas."}
{"text":"They pulled the shim sham... No Turkey Burgers, so of course, ordered the Grilled chicken sandwich (as a meal)... which was actually pretty tasty. The kicker, they charged me like $11 bucks for a burger meal that goes for $5.49... smh. Scammers!"}
{"text":"I've lived the area for nearly 8 years now and decided to wander in for breakfast. It was pretty much what I expected. NOTHING FANCY! However, it was really inexpensive good tasting food being served. I had the bacon and eggs (over medium) with a short stack of pancakes. The bacon was crispy as I requested. The eggs were over easy which I could deal with...the over medium is a new thing I'm trying these days. The pancakes were light and fluffy. The dining room doesn't offer any frills whatsoever. The benches in the booths are cushion less and orange which is the most annoying color that makes you want to leave as quickly as possible according to color studies. I have no complaints though. In fact, I can say I'll probably eat here again. What I didn't get was why they could use real plates but not use silver forks and knives instead of plastic. Maybe I'll try a breakfast burrito when I come back."}
{"text":"First time there hubby got the philly cheese steak sandwich I got the green chili burrito . yes such a variety of food . I even saw on the menu fish and chips .when I picked up our bag to go it was so heavy. My burrito was huge and yes having the other half for dinner . we are going back maybe I'll try a burger lol"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Love this place for a few reasons.  1) I can get wasted at Mi Patio across the street and walk here for the burger, which is delicious  2) Everything is cheap. I don't think I've spent more than $7 here.  3) Huge menu. Want a burger?  Yep. Want eggs and bacon? Yep. Want a burrito?  Yep.  4) Their breakfast burrito cures everything from hangovers and cancer.   10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Food:  The food was good and made fresh. I got the Veggie Burger, and it's probably one of the best tasting veggie patties that I've had. It had a nice flavor. My only comment is that the patty's consistency was a bit mushy, but that's a common problem among veggie patties. I would still get it again based on the taste alone.   Service:  The people working were very attentive and polite. The owner even asked us how the food was after we finished and wanted feedback.   Overall, I really liked this addition to the mall food court and I hope to see it stay."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting family and Burger Factory was highly recommended. Just from looking at the menu the prices seem a little high just for burgers and fries, but they have some interesting and fun items like burgers with cheese in the patty and their volcano fries. I ended up not getting a burger at all and decided to go with a funnel cake. It was so good- big and perfectly done with 3 massive scoops of vanilla ice cream and a good amount of strawberry syrup. I would definitely come back just for this funnel cake. The ambiance of the restaurant itself was a little dull and they covered the windows with giant posters which made the inside dark."}
{"text":"I always forget how large their portions are. Great food for a great price. I order the chili cheese fries and the chili has such a great and hearty flavor. The men working the drive thru are courteous and quick. I've never been inside and been through the drive thru approx. 5 times. I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"Does the Burger Factory live up to the take-out menu claim, \"Phoenix's Greatest Hamburgers\"?  The extensive menu ran from wall to wall above the order counter, ranging from American breakfasts, lunch and dinner classics to Mexican fast food. I wish they cut the menu and concentrate on what they do well, to avoid trying mediocre dishes. The counters and food preparation areas were spotless.  The seating area was eighties; laminated tables and molded plastic seating. The seating area is clean and serves its purpose but in need of a make-over.   The Bacon Cheese burger, was reminiscent of a summer day, kids playing by the pool, and mom and dad work the BBQ and prepare your meal.  My bacon cheese burger had crisp shaved lettuce, a tasty slice of tomato with a perfect charbroiled (slim) burger on a soft bun.   My first taste at the Burger Factory was the same as a summer BBQ, except in this case my family is Korean and there was no pool. Father and son behind the counter and it is all business; create and provide your order then move on. Mom gives a few hurried smiles as she takes orders and checks the grills. When I started asking general questions \"mom\" beamed with pride and said they have been in business 11 years and pointed out her husband and son.   On my first night I wanted so much to give this hard working \"family\" burger-joint a good review. However, my side order left me very disappointed; I asked myself, \"Who can screw up chili fries.\" The chili was dry as if it was simmering in the pot for several hours. The fries beneath this burnt experience were bland. I am not sure if I am willing to give this side order a second chance, but I went back seeking redemption from their vast menu.  The Patty Melt on night two lived up to my expectations. The grilled rye, onions, burger and cheese melted on my pallet. The Patty Melt had the perfect proportion of decadence (butter and grease) I was longing for. I ordered a side of Homemade Mushrooms. The breaded mushrooms were good and an improvement from the last side experience.   The owners' son handed me my second order at Burger Factory. I responded in Korean, \"Thank you much\". He rolled his eyes. I was thinking, \"What has come of today's youth.\" He was likely thinking, \"Your Korean sucks.\"  Update since 02/08  My Korean family must read Yelp. They are going to redo the joint with new laminated tables. The new tables will include local advertising. Clever. Still think they should concentrate on the menu. Last night I indulged in another artery clogging Patty Melt. Still love their burgers.  Sorry I have not been faithful lately. (ONE SENTENCE EDITED OUT BY REQUEST OF YELP). This is non-competitive to Yelp. Besides who could compete with these great reviews?  Spreading love and grease (the burgers). Ben"}
{"text":"The poutine here is bad!! The gravy is super salty and the fires are over cooked. The only thing they didn't mess up is the cheese"}
{"text":"Best burgers in mississauga. I have tried a lot of burgers in the GTA. With the burger competition heating up in Mississauga, I saw burger factory is still the top place. Now within the GTA, It might just barely make it to the top 5 but that is because toronto downtown itself has so many burger options that are a bit better in taste and also atmosphere"}
{"text":"Honestly the best burger I've had. I love savory and juicy burgers,  and this place drizzled on the love.  The onion rings were phenomenal too!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place....best steak sandwich ,,,breakfast....we share one order of fries.......They do a PERFECT job....the people are very nice!!! but the food wow and cheap~"}
{"text":"This place has very large portions! Not a very fancy restaurant, but good customer service and it was pretty clean."}
{"text":"An old-school burger joint that differs from its peers in a few ways.  It has more than a handful of options. I could get just about anything I wanted! I decided to go with the terriyaki burger. Most places do theirs with a sweet sauce and pineapple. I like that, but their take on it is equally good. It was rather salty, with tons and tons of onions.   Like, this is gonna sound gross, but it was so loaded with onions (which I love), you should not eat this burger if you have any plans that require human interaction afterward. People may not like you.   Anyway, it came with a mound of fries. I thought they were nothing special, but there's a freaking mountain of them, so good luck even finishing half.   The best part is that they didn't gouge me for like 15 bucks. Can you believe that's what a simple lunch is costing nowadays? It was about 9, and better than just about anything else I've paid 9 bucks for.   There was *tons* of breakfast stuff, and loads of sandwiches. I am afraid to order the King Kong burger without assistance. I can definitely say that while this place isn't flashy, it's worth going to and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Wow !! I was not expecting that !!! ... Most people think burgers and fries = fast food.. That was not the case here, true to their word burgers were fresh, juicy and tasty! The wait was well worth it. I had the cheesy Lucy with most toppings on it, with a side of onion rings, my boyfriend had the chicken fillet with most toppings and a side of fries. I do want to come back soon to try some of the other burgers as well funnel cake and when I do I let you guys know how that was."}
{"text":"Have to give this place a one star. Came here to eat, and it was during normal business hours. They apparently decided they wanted to close early because of something they were doing to the grill rather than stay open through their normal business hours. Find this to be very unaccommodating and disrespectful to guests who are trying to dine. Won't come back"}
{"text":"Honestly I have never been a fan of the Galleria food court until today .. Jay Jay hooked it up with an amazing mushroom Swiss burger with grilled onions and a smile on his face ... The fries are delicious and they sing while they grill up the yummy food .. My family tried it first while I was in line for my youngest and I took a bite of the classic burger and had to head to grab my own burger ... I don't know the other co workers name that is back there with him but he seemed upbeat and friendly for the time I was waiting for my burger ..   It came out fast and tastes delicious .. I'd  definitely give them a try if I were you"}
{"text":"I live just north of the Burger Factory, its always busy.  The menu offers a little bit of everything, making it a great place to bring an office group with  different tastes.    The food portions are large and if your looking for a greasy spoon the burger factory might be your place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers - a little cramped - pleasant staff - I order ahead of time to avoid long wait times. Tried the Cheese burgers only and they were really good the both times I visited."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never heard of this place after living here for 20 years!!! Outstanding burger!!!! Had the Bacon, Cheese and Avocado burger and it instantly goes into my top 5 of all time best burgers!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. The menu is very diverse and its overall decently good especially for the price. For breakfast i would suggest the original breakfast burrito. It comes with diced ham, sausage, bacon, hashbrowns, eggs, and cheese. I always add gravy to it and its about $5.25 after tax, really good considering its an entire breakfast in a burrito. For lunch and dinner the burger special can't be beat. But all in all most everything here is good especially if you stick to the traditional american food.  I hope this review helps and enjoy cause i do that's why im the duke of this joint!!"}
{"text":"This is an update from my previous review.  My trip this time was much better.  We went for lunch.  My salad was huge and my partner's food was cooked the way he liked it.  Much improvement from my previous experience."}
{"text":"What a mixture of extremes.   We all know the place is outdate and a little run down. When it comes to burger places that can actually be a good sign, at least where I am from...so no points off there.   My first impression was that the woman running the drive through window was rude. She actually rolled her eyes at me once, which makes me want to go postal. But I kept my temper. Still, knock off some stars there.   The food was good. I had a quarter pounder with a carne asada taco on the side. Burger was good--lots of toppings. The taco was also good, but the salsa was great. I had some fries, but was already full and only ate a couple. They were the big thick kind, but not bad based on the two I ate. I like the thinner ones better--one thing McDonald's actually does well, in my opinion.   Prices were good--$5.50 for a burger, fries and drink. $2.00 for the taco, but it had a lot of meat for the price.   They have amazing variety on their menu. This time I made a special trip based on a friend's recommendation, but I would not go out of my way to get here again. That said, there is so much here to try that I would stop by again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"The burgers are made here fresh everyday from scratch. No additives or preservatives. Halal meat, slaughtered in the most swift and conscious way possible.  Its got that home made taste to it. The buns are a bit soft which makes it a mess to eat.   Clean restaurant with lots of booth seating. Good for a quick sit in eat, or take out.   Id recommend this joint."}
{"text":"I really like to give it a 3.5, but I'll be nice and since Yelp doesn't have 1/2 star ratings, I'll give it the 4 star.  I've been there a handful of times and always enjoy the food.  I have tried the Juicy Lucy, the cheeseburger and the Utility (Philly Cheese steak sandwich).    The Utility was just tried today, and although it tasted great and the meat was cooked well, it soaked through the bun by the time I walked across the street to get back to work, so it was a complete mess to eat.  I'd eat it to stay next time, cause again, it was delicious.  Their burger meat is of above average quality, but its not great.  I have tasted better, but I'd definitely recommend this place to the burger lover that is in this area, I wouldn't go out of my way to try em though.    The fries are hand cut, fresh fries.  A little on the thick side, but they are done well.  I do enjoy them  I am a huge poutine lover, and the burger factory's poutine is not made with cheese curds, rather just shredded mozz. so its not a traditional poutine, but the one thing that makes this place is the gravy.  This is by far the best gravy I have ever tasted from any restaurant I have ever been too.  I do consider myself a gravy aficionado and I take my gravy seriously.  I will not go to some places because they don't have gravy or its not good enough if they do.  For example, I love 'Five Guys' burgers, but they don't have gravy so I don't go often.   The gravy alone keeps me going back, and was worth the extra .5 of a star for the rating.  Price is fair, and comparable to most fast food places for their higher end sandwiches, but the quality is far above a fast food joint."}
{"text":"The kids burger literally just comes with the bun and a piece of steak. Literally just that nothing else. What kind of burger is that, so disappointed."}
{"text":"2nd time here bc my coworkers always rave about it... But like the first time, not impressed. 3 stars for fast service and a wide variety of menu items. The food is nothing to get excited over. A lil over priced for the amount of meat you get. I ordered a patty melt this time and the meat is maybe 1/16 of a pound lol I don't eat a lot but this has me still hungry when I finished. Maybe I'm ordering the wrong things? Someone suggested a salad but the lady told me they only put lettuce tomato and pickle on them... No way in hell in eating a salad with pickles so I passed"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a bbq burger here, it was very good, my girlfriend got the teriyaki burger, she loved it as well .... staff was very friendly.... hate going to the mall, but this place made it worth it... thank you guys"}
{"text":"Indian dude on the grill is very rude. This place used to be great. Now it is a hit and a miss."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for over 20 years. They even nicknamed it, \"The Boys.\" They love the guys who work there, such hard workers and most of them are so nice. I think about 5 generations of my family has come here frequently, and I plan to continue that tradition. The food is great, authentic and fresh."}
{"text":"Very good honest burger 2nd time here and got great burgers each time.  Fast and a great value.  Looking forward to trying their breakfast burrito soon."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast yesterday and it was good as usual. But saw a customer with the Chicken Salad and decided to go back for dinner. Let me tell you that was a great choice I got the Chicken salad it was grilled chicken, pico, guacamole(could have sour cream had it left off) tomatoes, carrots on a bed of lettuce was a very big salad and very feeling. All for 6.99. Boyfriend had the fish and chips for 6.99 it came with 3 good sized pieces of fish, a whole plate of french fries and 3 onion rings. Then a roll and a big side salad. I told him we could have gotten a 4 piece for 7.99 and shared it. Really good. Took home 2 burgers and fries for the son. Loved it all."}
{"text":"Me and my family visited but this is definitely not a sit in family establishment. There were many to-go orders and sitting down wasn't a pleasant experience. The burgers were ok, the Cheesy Lucy was good with their Factory Sauce, BBQ Sauce and Lettuce, Onions and Pickles. The Utility was filled with too many fried Onions and not as much beef. I compared it with Top Gun Steak or Burgernator but this is nowhere near their l"}
{"text":"Listen, friends. This place has the BEST breakfast burritos around! We've lived nearby for about 10 years, and we've spent much of that time looking for the perfect breakfast burrito. Some neighboring burrito joints use French fries for the potatoes, some are too greasy, and some skimp on the eggs. So disappointing. Burger Factory, however, offers the perfect breakfast burrito.  The breakfast burritos at Burger Factory have a perfect balance of eggs, shredded hash browns and cheese. Their burrito comes with ham, bacon and sausage, but you can customize your burrito by asking for one meat, no meat, or any combination of the three. The sausage is breakfast sausage, not weird little hotdogs.   I smother my burrito in their pico de gallo, but my husband is a fan of their verde salsa. (You have to ask for the verde.) The burritos are big, too. We usually eat half on Saturday, and eat the other half on Sundays when Burger Factory is closed.   Burger Factory also has a drive-thru. Bonus! My kids like their beans and their fluffy pancakes as well.   I've probably spent too much of my life researching this topic. I highly recommend you add Burger Factory to your breakfast rotation in Central Phoenix."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I love Mexican food, and have usually found that non-chain hole-in-the-wall joints are really good.  But. This is the second time I've been here in 3 months. The first time, I got a ground beef burrito. I don't remember why I didn't like it, but I figured I'd try something else today.  Today, I tried the Patty Melt. It was just okay. Too many onions, very greasy, just okay. Also, the fries border on soggy, and have very little flavor.  I'll give this place another shot in the future and try something from the breakfast menu.  Prices are decent, good service."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the exterior. This place is pretty incredible.  My office was moving out of the area and we were looking for a delicious place to eat during our last week. We stopped here thinking we'd get a cheap but good burger, but we got so much more!  They have all kinds of cuisines. Burgers, Mexican, Gyros, fried food and more. It sounds sketchy, but everything I saw come out looked delicious and my dish was no exception.  I got the carne asada plate and it was fantastic. For $8 it was the largest plate of food I had seen in a while and worth every penny. The table next to us got a huge plate of zucchini fries and if my plate wasn't so large, I would have gotten an order of them to go they looked so good.  Even though we're further away now, I will definitely be returning to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Really good and satisfying burgers. I also enjoy their Philly Cheeseteaks. The onion rings are great but I wish they double-fried their fries; unfortunately, they're not crispy enough and can get soggy quickly."}
{"text":"HALAL! BURGERS! POUTINE! FUNNEL CAKE!  All this under one roof! Must I say more? The burgers here are amazing. Fresh meat, perfectly cooked, great tasting...this is what this place has.   The only reason they don't get a 5 star rating is for their customer service. Do not expect to be treated like a customer or \"the customer is always right\" kind of treatment. This is simply and order, eat, and walk out joint."}
{"text":"Burger Factory joins the busy entertainment district with a new storefront on Queen West. The medium sized diner makes good use of limited space, with almost twice the amount of seating as there is room in the open kitchen. Halal burgers, poutine, funnel cakes, and tornadoes - you name it, they'll make it.  Juicy Lucy is one of the signature burgers here, a must-try for first timers. For $2.99 you can add a drink and side of fries to your meal. Melty cheese gushes out of the meat patties with each bite.  Convenience and comfort seem to be the highlights of this joint, which is already popular outside of the GTA. I'm not sure if locals will catch on, as there are many upper tier burger establishments to compete with nearby. However, staff members are polite and orders are made rather quickly, though I haven't seen any lineups here so far. Overall, this is a welcome addition to the area."}
{"text":"There are many things good and bad I can say about the Burger Factory and I will do so here.  1) No credit cards or debit cards. Really??? 2) Bathrooms - ladies room has noticeable issue with the floor (it dips), the soap dispenser - seems to be filled with plain old water and the air dryers take too long to dry your hands.  Now for the food:  1) Burger Special - great deal; if you're looking for something other than a McDouble to kill your taste buds; however, the fries are terrific. 2) I ordered a Patty Melt one day and a few weeks later came back and had the fish; both were so greasy you could have used them for lubricating the wheels on your vehicle. The chicken tenders??? were so hard that in a previous life they could have been something fired from the muzzle of a pirate's pistol  In all, the Burger  Factory is still a great way to euthanize your taste buds. If you're really hungry for a good burger, there are other places to go."}
{"text":"Excellent old school burger restaurant.   I highly recommend  it. Fresh cut fries and home made burger patties never lie."}
{"text":"Good burgers here. Not much filler added - which is a bonus for me. Really good beefy flavor. Their house sauce tastes almost like Mac sauce? Not as sour.   Fries are really, really good and cooked fresh. Hidden in what seems like a sketched out plaza but when you drive in there is an abundance of other restaurants there so you feel a bit safer. Definitely would recommend but I mean its not like burgers priest or holy chuck but it still holds up on its own if you are in the area. It's just a really tasty and reasonably price straight up burger. I prefer normal classic well made burgers anyway. Contemporary  burgers with truffles and diamond and pearls and all of that jazz just isn't what a burger is suppose to be. I think good and unique flavors are always good and I wouldn't mind spending over $100 on a burger *cough chokes BYMARK but this place is reasonable for day to day beef cravings."}
{"text":"Juicy Lucy is the only reason why I decided to try this place.  I have not tried anything else on the menu but Jucy Lucy (stuffed meat patty with cheese) is delicious!!!! Fries - not so great  Customer service-needs improvement"}
{"text":"I came in here for a burger for a Friday lunch and I figured a place called \"Burger Factory\" would not disappoint.  When I got in there I was temped by all the options.  They have a lot of Mexican food options, a lot of other sandwiches, salads and even steak!  I stuck to my guns and got the cheese burger, protein style and large salad.  The salad was huge and not bad for an iceberg lettuce salad.  Watch out for the large chunks of carrot in there.  The Thousand Island dressing was quite good too.  The burgers are cooked the way God intended, over live fire!  You just can't get the same taste frying on a griddle.  I got it with \"everything\" which includes Thousand Island dressing, not mayo, mustard or ketchup.  You can ask for it that way if you want.  Anyway, the burger was good, a little messy to eat 'cause they really didn't wrap it up with large lettuce leaves but they had napkins on the tables.  The patty was very thin, 1/4 pounder but you can get a double.  Overall a good, flame grilled burger and great value for only $5!  Salad was $4 by the way."}
{"text":"I think for the value...they're expensive...even though they arent \"expensive\". Perhaps a waste of money is better imagined. I ordered a PLAIN BBQ BURGER and a side of fries. We had to wait for a bit, which is fine but kinda not fine after seeing what we were presented. Why the plain? My son is allergic to dairy so no cheese and he doesn't even eat the usual burger veggies so plain it is. However, if one is ordering a plain BBQ burger...woudn't it be common sense the person would like the burger with just the bbq sauce? Because if I wanted to skip on the sauce...I should have just ordered a hamburger plain. By the time we got our order, even the cook comes out with an unconfident vibe about what he just served us or something. I lookwd into the burger out of habit because of my son's allergies and saw cheese. I, with my cracked sick voice, politely said...oh, I wanted it plain, no cheese. The lady who had rang me up looked at me, then looked at her register as if 1)I was wrong for not telling her 2)the register could verbally back her up like oh no she didnt. However, oh yes I did because, again, my son has a dairy allergy.  Anyway, after that quick awkward moment feeling like it was my fault, they took the burger back. No one said, oh I'm sorry about that we'll make you a new one, oh I'm sorry about that..you did mention that, oh I'm sorry I didn't hear you. Nothing. So as they walk away they go into the kitchen to say I wanted it plain. Then from the back of the kitchen they turned to ask DID YOU WANT BBQ SAUCE?  Ugh, apparently my common sense is pretty deep because if I'm ordering a plain bbq burger...I'm expecting a plain bbq burger with just its bbq sauce. If I wanted a plain hamburger, then I woud have ordered the hamburger, the first item on your burger menu, plain.   They are a new establishment, I understand. But you gotta have something workable. If your service sucks where you can't even get a thank you for waiting, my apologies for the error, etc...then you get a burger that looks alright...why come back. Pass. Never again.  In fairness, I didn't personally eat the burger. It was for my son. My 6 year old said it was.okay. He's a petite little guy and he was still hungry afterwards. Their fries, I tried, aren't that bad though.  Definitely kid and stroller friendly as it sits in the food court of the Galleria mall where McDonald's used to occupy."}
{"text":"My mom and I were at the mall and we decided to have lunch here.  The spot used to be a McDonalds and is now this place.  The cashier took our order right away.  We then had to wait quite a bit of time for our food.  Not sure why since they were not busy.  Maybe it just took a bit of time to cook the burgers.  I had the mushroom burger with no cheese and a side of onion rings.  The burger was nicely cooked.  Could have been a bit juicer and needed more mayo.  The onion rings were crispy, not too greasy and had a nice flavor.  And they are served with ranch dressing.  Yum.  My mom had the BBQ burger with fries.  She thought the burger was good and the fries were tasty.  Nice and crisp, soft on the inside.  If we are at the mall again, we definitely will try this place again."}
{"text":"I was craving a big juicy burger and decided to give Burger Factory a try.  When we arrived there was only one other guest. Ordering was a breeze, location was clean. The food took about 10 minutes, but who cares if its hot & fresh...right??  And OMG...they were both hot and fresh!! The fries were perfectly crispy, hot and salty....delish. The burger with a bunch of topping was big, hot and not so juicy but hit the spot.  My son ordered the #1 combo and I had the #5 combo, both with fries.   We will definitely be back with hopefully room in our bellys for funnel cake!!"}
{"text":"For a fast food place in a mall I would have to say that I am amazed by how GOOD their burgers are!  The owner is fantastic and is always keeping the place clean. I just love how dedicated she is with this place. Their teriyaki burger is my FAVORITE and the mushroom burger with teriyaki sauce on the side is heaven!:) You really can't beat the price though.. especially if you work at that mall, you get that discount! ;D Haha"}
{"text":"Burgers are good!  The fries are alright but they need a bit more salt. Also, the restaurants AC  is always hot.  That's the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering from this place.  I wanted something quick, and honestly all the photos I've seen looked so good, so I decided to give it a shot. I was NOT let down.   I ordered a cheesey lucy, and honestly if you're a fan of cheese, do yourself a favor and try this burger. It had cheese injected into the patty. Amaaaaazing. The fries are thick cut fries and they were delicious (I got a poutine).   All in all I was not disappointed, and I don't think you will be either."}
{"text":"Great tasting food, the best french fries in the mall, and fantastic staff that treat you well and keep the place clean and organized. Its hard to find food that is treated right and tastes good, every single time.... thats why i love this place. They know what i order and they have it ready in time for me to enjoy my lunch break. The owner is usually there so its always running like a well oiled machine. Try the fries, you will love them."}
{"text":"Honestly, the burger was average. Bun was not soft at all. Was crusting up. The tornado fries was a lot! Good for two people.   My order for the funnel cake was messed up. Forgivable since the staff were nice about admitting the mistake.   The funnel cakes was two thumbs up. Last time I had funnels was at Wonderland like 6 years ago. Felt like a kid again while eating it!  If I go back, it will be just for the funnel cakes."}
{"text":"Living down the street, I've probability passed the Burger Factory about a thousand times, always wondering what the food was like. Tonight my fiancé and I stopped in. First and foremost, the menu rivals that of any large restaurant. Something for every mood. And when the food was done (quickly, I might add), it was mouth watering. The burgers are thin but large, and perfectly cooked. The country fried steak sammy, scrumptious. Great food, especially at this little dive. We'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"I love BF. They have the best burger deal in town. Burger, Fries and Drink super cheap. Their burgers and fries are one of the best in Phx! What is really wonderful too and extremely, outstandlishly ( Is that a word?) delicious here is their Breakfast Burro. Who knew? Huge, cheap, tasty-YUMMY!  It is actually one of the best ones I have ever had. They use real sausage too. Check it out.The place is a dive though but you know what they say about divey places having good food.  If you go through drive in be careful it has a strange scary curve. They say a lot of accidents happen in their drive through so no drunk or hung over food runs, OK?"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Food is extremely delicious - i usually order Juicy Lucy (meat stuffed with cheese) and tornado (potato chips on skewer). It tastes even better with their factory sauce! Great food, and great service. Wait-time for the burger is a bit long, but it's so good that it's worth the wait. Casual atmosphere, and the few times I've dropped by there was always seating available."}
{"text":"They used to be amazing. But now the quality has gone down n so has the service. The staff has an \"I don't really care kind of attitude\".. No apologies given when order was messed up. Told to wait in line again as order had missing items.. Buns were stale n stiff.. Im rather disappointed to say the least.."}
{"text":"Their Pastrami sandwich is SO DELICIOUS!!! Words cannot really describe this beautiful masterpiece!!! The pastrami just melts in your mouth. Every bite is worth it. Their fries are great & drinks just as good as the next item on their menu! Their service is awesome as well. Everyone is so nice & helpful....and extremely patient. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area!"}
