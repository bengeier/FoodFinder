{"text":"I have always had great experiences at Downtownfood and would highly recommend. I have been here for lunch, dinner and special events, and dtf has done all of these well. 
During the work week, they do a $25 3 course prix fixe menu, which is an excellent value. 
The service is always great, and a nice atmosphere as well.  Can't wait for Chef D-Mac to open his new restaurant in Mission!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Nice atmosphere. Food is a little rich, but still very good."}
{"text":"Went to Downtown Food Saturday night. The place was 1/4 full and we were seated at a table near the door. First word of advice - to create a customer experience you should not place anyone in these seats if the place is not full - you do not get to view the dining room at all.  Also, in these seats, the speakers seemed to be on top of us and the music was quite loud. 

The food is excellent  and this kind of made up for where we sat.  My 2nd piece of advice, we ordered the flourless chocolate cake - the server barely placed it on the table - it seemed like the plate was heavier than she was.  The plate was hot and she kind of threw it down on the table. As the dessert was being shared, she put the plate in front of me and I tried to move it, and was warned the plate was hot.  

They ran out of Elk steak.  The server was friendly.

If anyone goes, ask to be seated in the dining room and not by the door."}
{"text":"We went to dtf on a Saturday night. Without a reservation we were able to sit at the bar which was actually perfect for us. We had stopped in for a light meal and decided on a few appetizers and dessert. The food was delicious and the bartender described the origin of each ingredient which made the meal more interesting. The mushroom ravioli left us wanting more, they were truly delicious. We had the chocolate cake for dessert with house-made chocolate ice cream and Cabernet sorbet. We enjoyed the atmosphere, service and especially the food at dtf!"}
{"text":"Excellent 8 course meal and service to go along with it!

If you have not gone yet, you are missing out on amazing tasting food.

Thanks to all at DTF for the memorable meal and evening."}
{"text":"I was visiting Calgary in March, and looking for a delicious lunch within the city. downtownfood was close to the LRT and had good reviews, so I decided to give it a try. I ended up having an absolutely amazing dining experience. 
I was seated by chef/owner Darren MacLean - it was a weekday and just after the business rush, so I think I benefited from being one of the few people in the restaurant. I was treated incredibly well by the chef and the staff - I'm a huge believer in customer service and this experience was off the hook. I'm not sure that everything I had is currently on the menu at this moment, so I'm just going by (my terrible) memory. 
I was brought a ceviche to start - light, flavourful, topped with a single kernel of popcorn (which I thought was a nice nod to SA ceviche) - a great start. My main was the Banh Mi Board - I thought this was a really interesting twist on the charcuterie board. The cured meats were tender and well sized; the pickled vegetables were flavourful; it was a lot of food and I ate it all. Dessert was a chocolate mousse type cake (which seems to align with the \"Flourless chocolate cake\" currently on the menu) - again, delicious and light and the cake seemed to almost transition into the crust. The pastry chef was kind and also made me an apple fritter - amazing - like a little funnel cake. I would absolutely order any and all of these items again. 
On top of this, they had a good beer selection and ambience. Definitely a highlight of my trip out west. Thanks to Darren for a great experience!"}
{"text":"The chef and owner of this restaurant is clearly one of the most dedicated food professionals in the city, with a strong dedication to local (including from the restaurant's rooftop) and sustainable (e.g. OceanWise seafood) ingredients.  I've been putting off updating my old-as-dirt review until I went again for a standalone regular dinner, but that hasn't happened yet. Why? There are so many special events in town that either happen at DTF, or that they participate in, or that they do in-house collaborations with that I've eaten there many times without a regular reservation! Regardless of the menu on a given night (note that the lunch menu is less inspired), at this often Asian-tinged eatery virtually everything is made from scratch, including the tofu.  As Kierkegaard once said \"once you label me, you negate me\", so don't put too much stock in the Asian-tinged comment, as I don't know many Asian themed restaurants that serve lemon tart and buttered beer. No matter the subject, the taste is usually spot on and the presentation appealing. Chef Darren wears his heart on his sleeve, and on the plate. Eat here and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't usually give 5 stars but I couldn't find a single thing wrong with this place. Or server, Kat, was phenomenal, making great recommendations and telling us all about every dish. You could tell she was really excited about the food they serve. We got the Big Taste 3 course dinner menu. For an appetizer, I had a spot prawn ceviche with coconut milk and lime, topped off by tandoori popcorn. My friend had roasted beet tartare with a horseradish aioli and Granny Smith apples, served with cumin crisps. Amazing flavours, starting off sweet and ending with a bit of spice. Had the wild boar belly with wasabi grits and sautéed kale fr a main. If I died and went to heaven, every meal would taste like this. Perfect flavours, amazing presentation. Finally for dessert, a tequila lime pie with marshmallow meringue, tequila sorbet, chili pickled limes coconut and salted agave crisps which was a party in my mouth of textures and flavours. 

You can tell this restaurant puts lots of care Into the food thy create. Hands down the best meal and service I've had in Calgary so far."}
{"text":"As part of Calgary Poutine Crawl 2013 this was stop 3 of 6.  They make everything from scratch including the bacon!  

Here it is all about the bacon!

Yummy"}
{"text":"Went here during a business trip with a group of ladies, and it did not disappoint. I had the wild boar chop (the last one!), and it was very good - perfect complimenting sauces and side portions. We each ordered dessert which was fantastic - I had a deconstructed key lime pie. I would recommend it, and as an out-of-towner, it didn't seem to be that busy (Tuesday evening) or too expensive (maybe $25/entree)."}
{"text":"Food was outstanding; fresh and full of flavor.  You can taste the love they put into making their meals.  Yummy homemade Brioche bun.  It was an enjoyable lunch with a comfortable & welcoming setting (chairs where very comfy). Server was friendly and willing to answer our questions.  There were a few items on the menu that were not available when we went to order.  We will have to come back to try them. I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about downtown food - a self described modern bistro on 8th. While it doesn't necessarily strike me as a 'bistro' - it was a lovely place for lunch on a cloudy and windy Tuesday! 

I was surprised that the restaurant wasn't very busy - good lunch places are hard to come by - but those that take reservations are even more special. This part of 8th Ave (between 5th and 6th Street) is still developing, and maybe that is why it is still possible to get a reservation at 12 only a day or two in advance! But regardless of location, this place is worth a visit.

My colleague and I decided to share the Kam Saw Ham Nee Dah Burger (featuring DTF famous 777 bacon) and the Bacon Salad (featuring more of the DTF famous 777 bacon!). The kitchen went that extra step and served the burger as two mini burgers for us - a touch you don't often see when sharing a meal. The burger was DELICIOUS and a salad featuring bacon is ok in my books any day!

We had a lovely little server, easily excited by our choice of dishes. The ambiance was also pleasant - not so empty you feel that other guests are listing to your every word, but not so loud that you lose your voice by the end of the meal. And the nice white chairs are very comfortable.

So go on, make your reservation for DTF and order the burger with the name you can't pronounce. Do it - do it now!

{"text":"I work pretty close to here. As in \"I could leave my building and log roll to it in under 30 seconds\". Yet hadn't tried downtownfood until today. Bad Lauren, bad.

I went for lunch with a coworker. We made reservations but it wasn't too busy inside (12:30) so maybe we didn't need them. We were both really impressed with the décor -  clean, nice lighting and warm without being too cozy that it was awkward to be dining with a co-worker.

The service was very friendly throughout the meal. Lots of great recommendations that seemed very genuine. We were asked about our experience by several people, throughout the meal, without it being overbearing. They had a nice wine list including decently priced \"by the glass\" selections (the Riesling was lovely).

I had the house burger which was a great size -  not grossly huge but well put together bursting with flavours of bacon, kimchee and other things. It was served with yummy homemade fries and house ketchup which was also good. My friend had a vegetarian smoked mushroom curry. She said it had kick and was delicious but wished there was more of it. She actually ate my burger bun too lol.

We opted to go all out and share a dessert. After the server's loving tale of the hazelnut chocolate dessert, we were sold. Unfortunately she had to come back and tell us they were sold out. We opted for a lemon desert instead (other than the gelato it was the only option). It was good...very fresh and tart but it wasn't chocolate.

Downtown Food is a real Gem. I like their philosophies on food (farm to table) and their flavour profiles. There is really nothing quite like it in the area and it's a great change from having pub food for lunch.

They did have two weird things though. One, the bench seating is a lot higher than the chair seating. So you as the bench seat user will be looking down at your dining companion. The other thing is that their credit card machine tries to auto-tip 18%. You do that the option of changing it to a lower or higher percent or a dollar amount, but I am thinking a lot of people hit \"okay\" and pay 18%. Is that the standard now? Especially for a table for two? I think not. It just seemed a little presumptuous."}
{"text":"An unexpectedly excellent meal with attentive service. Katie did an excellent job, and both the pork and fish entree looked and tasted incredible. Will be back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Downtown Food is an unassuming place smack in the middle of 8th Ave between 5th and 6th street.

You'll have to look hard for the little place with the high white chairs and the home-cured 777 bacon; but it will be worth the work because Downtown Food delivers on it's promise to provide local, fresh, organic dishes lovingly well.

The lunch crowd is steady here, so if you want beer and vodka battered fish with sparkling wine in the mid-afternoon, go early or late because Downtown Food is packed with architects and businesswomen - making it harder to get a table.

What you should do is go for dinner - or even better - go for the relatively unknown tapas hour from 3 to 6 pm and experience little Asian-meets-French food wonders like crispy pork wontons washed down with a warm, creamy beer.

Should you get caught up in the wine and the conversation and stay past 6, you'll get to try chicken liver mousse off the dinner menu, which is a fluffy slash creamy delight that you'll have to be careful not to horde. 

In a nice departure from Calgary's recent, and sometimes annoying, \"we don't take reservations\" trend; Downtown Food lets you reserve your table, either online or by phone. A nice touch if you were wondering in a pinch where to take your date to eat before the show.

Downtown Food is simple and straightforward; the service attentive; the space comfortable and intimate; and its food fresh and bright with just the right hint of love; making this modern bistro a pretty little jewel for the food lover in all of us.

{"text":"Phenomenal space, staff, owner, and the food amazing. Do not miss or pass this experience up."}
{"text":"Darren is a fantastic chef and completely committed to bringing you the BEST food. I love this place."}
{"text":"THIS. This is exactly what I expect and everything that I want when I go out to eat. I loved this place, everything from the decor to their cheeky acronym, DTF. My cousin brought me here during Calgary's Big Taste event and we had a fabulous lunch. The pappardelle pasta was my favorite, but the apple fritters and duck taco didn't disappoint either. We went after the lunch rush so the restaurant was quiet. Staff was attentive and friendly, the whole place has a very genuine vibe while still being cool and classy. If you check in here on Yelp you unlock an offer for a free appetizer! Do you need anymore incentive? GO NOW."}
{"text":"(Visit Oct. 4th)

Well, I made a shout out to Yelpers of Calgary and they came through with flying colours. I said give me the best and they certainly did. I was dying to get downtown and see what Calgary really had to offer. After a short ride on the C-Train I found myself enjoying the couple block walk to the restaurant which was easy to find.

When I entered I was surprised. I suddenly felt under dressed (is that possible in Calgary?) but asked to sit at the bar for lunch and enjoy the ambience. I love this place! Went to freshen up in the ladies room. GORGEOUS, (not me) the restroom!!!

I head back out to read the menu. It is one sheet that indicated it was their \"Fall menu\". There was a Prix Fix menu offered but I chose just to go with their Asian style burger with a last minute change of fries to salad. I was hesitant to ask for the change as I had already placed my order; but once I made it to the bottom of their menu and read \"most of the things you are eating were grown on our roof\", I could NOT pass that up. I was not disappointed. The smell of fresh greens and house made vinaigrette got my taste buds excited!!  It had been days since I had good food I was ready to savour the sights and smells I was about to receive.

Being a slow eater my burger came out before i was finished my salad.No worries. Although the burger was small to look at it was big in taste. And honestly, very thick. It was pink inside, of which I am not used to , but it made it extra juicy.  The meal included a surprise mini Root Beer float. I slowly indulged in the food and drinks around me. I had such a stressful week I felt I \"owed\" my self a fine dining experience. 

Thank you so much to Jada and Noelle for extending their gracious Calgarian hospitality!!"}
{"text":"Do you want to know something that will make you feel good? Eating good food while knowing you are supporting a great cause. I went and joined the Yelp Eats at Downtown Food yesterday evening and did just that!

I was quite pumped to try this venue after looking up the menu online which promised wonderful mixtures of Asian and French influences in a modern setting.

When I sat down on the soft white chair in a semi private area of the restaurant, there was already some tapas and apps on the table to try out so I started to just dig in! I tried many and all had their own little something special... This list included:
Crispy House Smoked Oysters, Ewenique Farms Chicken Liver Mousse, Roast Jungle Farms Beet Salad, Tuna Tataki, Sweet Chili Scallops, Vodka beer battered smelt, crostini and a portion of the market pasta which was house made noodles with \"triple seven\" bacon in an egg emulsion sauce. This pasta was creamy but surprising had no dairy! Also we tried the flourless chocolate cake and lemon tart....

Yes, it was tons of food but since we all shared - it was nice to be able to get a feel of what they had to offer! 

It was refreshing to sample, nibble and taste freshly prepared food from a kitchen that enjoys creating these plates vs. some other places that just whip something up for a dollar."}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed with a meal at downtownfood and tonight was no exception. Although I came to order my favorite dish (crispy duck leg) it wasn't on the menu tonight so opted for the prime rib. The steak was cooked to perfection and was paired with bok choy, mushrooms, and bacon. For appetizers we also ordered spicy tempura maki, scallop ceviche, and beef tartare. The flavors of lime and coconut in the ceviche were to die for, and the addition of quail egg on the maki was quite a nice touch. When you get your food the staff take the time describe everything you are about to eat, even the way it's prepared. You can tell the chef really takes pride in the menu and uses the freshest ingredients for each dish. The menu changes frequently to accommodate the season so I always look forward to what's new on the menu everytime I visit."}
{"text":"We went for an early Valentines dinner, and what a dinner it was! We were completely spoiled. 

Our 6 course meal turned to so many courses we eventually lost count and just drowned in the deliciousness that is the food at DTF.

Let me start my listing everything we ate:
- The amuse which had shrimp and a tandoori popcorn and I popped it into my mouth so fast that I dont know what else was in it. Delicious.
- The beet tartare. Quite good, but not my favourite of the night.
- A compressed pear, apple, candied walnut and blue cheese salad. Very tasty, and fiance seemed to love it.
- The beef ravioli. Just on bite wasnt enough. I wanted more, it was so so good. The brought out fresh truffles that they shaved tableside onto my ravioli dish. Amazing! The broth it was sitting in was heavenly. I only had a fork so I couldnt scoop it all into my mouth and I half-debated asking the waitress if I could have a spoon so I could finish the broth. 
- The duck 'ham' and cheese, which is basically cured (I think) duck, cheddar and seared foie gras on a sliced baguette. It was a rich, and seriously good.
- The lobster soup. Holy, I could have an entire meal of just this. It was creamy, yet not too heavy, and very lobster-y. Chef Darren said he puts no white wine in the broth. He didnt need any, because this dish was to die for. 
- We shared two mains. One mains, we had the pan-seared sabledish with boy choy and mushroom marinated/glazed with miso and ginger and gojuchang sauce. It was served on this 2-foot long plate, which was quite funny. The fish was incredibly soft, tender and buttery. My fiance and I both absolutely loved it. 
- For our other main, we had the confit duck leg on braised cabbage. The cabbage was a cool - it look and served the purpose of pasta - but it wasnt! The cabbage was spicy, which was nice. The duck leg had a crispy skin on it, with the cabbage, was really good.
- For dessert we tried the lemon tart with cassis gelato; and the DTF s'mores with vanilla bean ice cream. I am a vanilla bean fiend, so I ate it all up even though my tummy was bursting at the seams by now. 
- We finished everything off with two little lemon macaroons, light and refreshing.

I also had the DTF farmers Martini, and 2 glasses of wine. The martini was awesome - cucumber, gin, sage and elderflower. I love refreshing, herby cocktails, so this was great.

All in all, this meal was absolutely terrific. We could see that the staff really care about the customers. The server/waitress we had was very warm and friendly, the sommelier was nice enough, and Chef Darren was attentive, ever-present and a hoot, as usual.

Some things to note about DTF: they make everything from scratch, right down to the bread they serve with butter. They put care into what they deliver, and it shows.

I bumped into this girl I know in the bathroom and named off a few things for her to try, because she was vegetarian and didnt know what to order! 

This place has tons of potential! I've already recommended the restaurant to a friend who was looking for a place to go for Valentines. We will for sure be back for their Wagyu beef tasting board, because that sounds phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant for sticking to it's ideals. Making compressed pairs and their own mushroom consume from scratch is an art. We had the chef's tasting menu and initially I thought the portions were so small but by the end of the night I was concerned I would not have room for the delicious hazelnut/Giant Ferraro Roche chocolate cake and gelato. The food here is crafted like each one is a labour of love and it reflects in the intensity of flavours and the deliciousness all round."}
{"text":"It's not every day that I take pleasure in being able to eat my own words.

A week before my visit, I got to talk to the chef about a really mean story that I overheard about him 2x from someone that I trust. We got it all sorted out, and he even sent me a picture of him...

HOLDING A BABY GOAT.

Whaaaat. Service here was fucking amazing, Megan is a boss and super-friendly. It's not every restaurant that I can go to in town that is not only vegan-friendly, not only goes out of their way to assure you that they're vegan-friendly, but even makes their own silken tofu and makes me a tofu charcuterie board. And vegan versions of their appetizers so that I don't feel left out! I teared up.

Then they made a dessert that wasn't just plain cut-up fruit! A week later, and the picture I posted on IG is still getting likes from all over the world. It tasted every bit as good as it looked. It was almost too pretty to eat.

So thanks, Chef Darren and the crew at Downtown Food! You guys are my new favorite."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that you pay a lot of money for not that much food. If you go in expecting that then you can have a great dining experience because the food is pretty solid."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and excellent service!!

Had the pork belly and the variety of tastes was astounding. The dessert, a tiramisu, was equally fantastic.  

I have no qualms recommending this place!"}
{"text":"It was a Wednesday evening and my girlfriend and I booked based on the yelp rating,... pulled up in front and the restaurant looked empty, as empty as they get,.. this didn't look good and we looked at each other and wondered if we should continue...  

We're very glad we did!

The restaurant does not attract a lot of foot traffic / drop ins given its location.  A few other diners strolled in and we were all seated in the same section so it didn't feel as though we were completely alone.  The service was excellent and the waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and attendant to our needs.

My girlfriend is gluten intolerant and the menu had many options that appealed to her and to me.  In fact, the key lime pie we shared for desert was rated by her as the best GF desert she had had in over a year.  

Overall, the restaurant is excellent. I would definitely go back to explore the menu as it changes."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for weekday lunch with a polymath whose deep intellectual curiosity makes for great conversations. But about the food on my 2nd visit: I tried the mussel chowder, followed by seared steelhead trout on bouillabaisse. Both were delicious, and service was gracious and attentive. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Heard huge hype about the restaurant so had some expectations, though unfortunately not met. Service was good and waitress knowledgeable. Food was underwhelming. Not good value for money."}
{"text":"Recently I attended The Big Taste Pop Up YYC six course pop up dinner at downtown food with some foodie friends.  It was hosted by John Gilchrist and had a stellar line up of Chef's in attendance: Chef Darren MacLean, Chef Duncan Ly, Chef John Jackson, Chef Roy Oh.  Each Chef prepared a dish for each of the six courses plus we were teased with a delightful Amuse Bouche to start the evening.

The decor & ambiance in the bistro is very modern.  Immediately upon entering you notice how inviting, warm and friendly the restaurant is.  The staff go out of their way to make you comfortable and ensure you leave happy.

The food during the Pop Up was decadent, erogenous, flavorsome and full of love.  You could tell a lot of work went into the planning of this event.  Definitely left us wanting more.

I look forward to returning and trying out more on their menu."}
{"text":"I must be the only one who had a so-so experience here. After reading all these wonderful reviews I wanted to try it out for my birthday. We order duck liver pâté and tuna ceviche with tandoori popcorn on top for appetizers they came decently quick. But half an hour after we finished the appetizers and that bottle of wine, we still haven't gotten our entrees. There was only one other table since we got there at like 7 which is pretty early for dinner, so I don't know what could have possibly taken them that long. When our entrees finally arrived. My lamb shank was cold and tasted a little bland. I tried my friend's crispy duck leg, it was indeed crispy but a little bit dry."}
{"text":"I feel like not a lot of people know about this place but really it's great! I love the decor and I think they are extremely creative wi the types of food they pair together. Love that I had eggplant dumplings as an appetizer. The servers are hilarious, and I love that they use DTF on their menu. The food was splendid and I would say my favorite part was that they used truffle oil (seriously obsessed with that stuff) and they have a micro green garden on the roof where they grow and utilize there own crops. Fantastic! How many places do you know that do that? I would come back here Ina heartbeat. Love it!"}
{"text":"Have you tried downtownfood yet? You need to. For real, put it to the top of your list of places you want to try. 

The food is oh-so-pretty. Every time I'm in, my phone's out taking another picture to make all my friends drool (yes, I'm that girl. But what's a Yelper to do when she wants to share her appreciation for what's in front of her?). 

You might be thinking, \"But Wendy... pretty food is nothing if it doesn't make me want to roll my eyes into the back of my head with palatable pleasure.\" You would be correct, there's nothing worse than food that doesn't live up in taste to how good it looks. Here, you will not be disappointed. There is such attention to detail on the flavours and textures and I'm sure all other manner of food considerations that I know nothing about. If you aren't pleased for whatever reason, let them know! I've never met a Chef as committed to an exceptional eating experience for his patrons as Chef Darren.

The menu is ever changing, with daily lunch and dinner specials. In the past, I've enjoyed items like:

- banh mi board
- tuna tataki
- eggplant wantons
- pickerel
- tacos
- silken tofu
- salmon nigiri
- pan seared foie gras

The list continues... 

You must try the 777 bacon. 

Tips: 

#1. Bring friends who love food and love to share food. 
#2. If you're budget conscious, make sure it's your splurge night, or visit at lunch. It's like when you go on the vacation of your dreams, you want to enjoy every bit of it without worrying what your price tag will be... dtf is an experience worth paying for.
#3. Sit at one of the tables, unless you can get a full booth. The benches and the chairs are at different heights and it makes your meal a bit awkward when you aren't eye level with your dining mates. 
#4. If it's still on the drink menu, order a silk kimono."}
{"text":"I've been to DowntownFood several times in the last couple of months. Great food, great service, what more do you want? 

Some of their dishes are just plain awesome, while others I'd describe as \"over-ambitious\" but definitely not bad. In fact, there's a little bit of everything for everyone (even for vegans).

Chances are you are going to have a very good meal at this restaurant. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Yet another pleasant surprise of late. Walked in here on a recommendation from a co-worker. 

Decent ambiance, quick service and very nice folks working here. 

There were a couple of lunch selections that suit vegans/vegetarians which was awesome. They had hot tea to choose from as well. 

Jeff had a burger which came served with a mini root beer float - interesting and unexpected touch that Jeff really enjoyed. 

The calamari was ordered as well and was spicy/not greasy and a very interesting take on the dish as well. 

We would definitely go back here for lunch. I wouldn't mind seeing what the dinner/evening menu is like in here as well."}
{"text":"Do not come to Downtownfood at lunch without a reservation. It will be impossible to find a seat. Partly because this area of Downtown Calgary lacks good lunch spots at reasonable prices, partly because of the stir Downtownfood has caused since they opened. 

My problem with Downtownfood is that the food is not particularly Chinese, Japanese or even Western for that matter. It's a jumbled mess of fusion that is refreshing to some but sad to others. I'm of the latter camp. 

The menu lacks cohesion. Or perhaps it is cohesively fusion. 

Do come for dinner, reservation strongly recommended."}
{"text":"Wow, what a fabulous restaurant! The room itself is quite lovely, although the front part is a little awkward. I love the large artwork of Calgary cityscape's and the wood totally rocks! If I wasn't there for a family dinner I most definitely wood have sat up at the wood for dinner. The service is phenomenal, from the hostess to our insane rock star of a waitress to the chef coming out to explain each dish, I was blown away! 

We had an amazing dinner; the menu is small but packed with interesting, exciting plates packed with flavour! The high point was most definitely the civiche - hands down the best civiche I have ever had. Instead of being a chopped style, it was more like a stacked canape. Mmmm, delicious! One thing that I will warn, the protein portions are very large. Much bigger then I think they ought to be. We ordered only 2 entrees between the 4 of us so that we would have room for dessert; we couldn't even finish the wild boar dish. Just too big and thus sadly, no dessert. 

If you are looking for a place to go for an excellent meal, put Downtown Food at the top of your list."}

{"text":"My friend treated me to The Big Taste's 3 course lunch today at DTF.  I remember when this restaurant was that old Sorabol Korean Restaurant and now, it's renovated to house DTF with all its chic and trendy furnishings.

We started off with a Duck Confit Tacos - Cumin spiced coleslaw, guacamole, yellow chili salsa, queso fresco, and fresh lime - crispy taco with the wonderful duck confit and all the trimmings sitting on a guacamole mound.  The presentation was very eye-catching and the appy very pleasing to the tummy!

Next came the Braised Wagyu Beef Papardelle - Red wine braised oxtails, tomatoes, shallots, chipotle and cumin with peppery arugula and parmesan - Nice big & tasty  portion of the braised oxtails (without the tail, of course!) nestled amongst the perfect al dente parapdelle, nicely topped with sprigs of argula. A big A+!!

Dessert: Housemade to Order Orange Maple Donuts - We were a little disappointed with the dessert as they were like those mini donuts you get at Stampede and there were only 2 on a square plate.  We were expected either bigger donuts or possibly 2 mini donuts each.  The donuts were made fresh and it was piping hot when we got them and the flavours definitely came out when it was still hot.  

Finished our lunch with a pot of mint tea each.  Quite delightful.

Thanks, my friend, for the sumptious lunch today!  Owe you one back."}
{"text":"Ever try telling someone you ate at \"Downtown Food\" and see a look of ... \"OK, but where?\" on their face?

Yup. Everytime. Unusual name, but it's kinda cute. I have been here twice now and most recently today for a client work lunch. Agreeably both times were quite enjoyable and overall the food was amazing!

We were late for our reso but all the same, greeted with warm smiles and seated immediately. A server quickly took our drink orders and explained the special for lunch which was an appie something, main something and a HOMEMADE DONUT (you can see what part caught my attention). Drinks arrive and after an excruciating 15 minutes of trying to decide across a number of great vegetarian options (unusual) I went with the gnocchi, which was created from a multitude of vegetables and accompanied with mushrooms and truffle. I also got a \"green garlic\" puree soup. Of course such an option was debated at the table because WHO KNOWS WHAT GREEN GARLIC IS? We are of the assumption it's the snape? (*I just goggled this now and we're wrong.. it's an \"immature\" garlic and resembles a green onion perfectly*). 

Appies arrive and the watermelon three ways is a picture book of plating perfection with square inch size watermelon cubes, wrapped in cucumber invisibly thin and mint on top. Like little presents really. The tuna is deliciously seasoned, the wontons with eggplant and goat cheese were ridiculously good and the truffle fries... YESSS!! Truffle fries. I hate to overshadow the chef creations with excitement for fries - but seriously, good. The soup was also really delicious and contained fiddleheads - my first on these and I quite liked. My main dish - the gnocchi might have been some of the best I have ever had. It was super fresh and hand made, multi colored based on differing vegetables, lots of mushrooms on the side and a rich sauce that I could have drank straight (likely butter I believe). It was also lightly truffled and not too overpowering. Portion size was perfect which was great with a rich meal for lunch.

Finally - the grand finale. DESSERTS! The foreshadowing of the aforementioned donut was of course ordered. This thing was outstanding. Hot and fresh (think crispy cream - but not as ... \"cheap\"), glazed with an amazing chocolate and topped with cookie crumbs. Below on the plate was a dollop of house made caramel that was salted. The warm combo was ...  was... well it disappeared REALLY FAST. Another? Ugh.. if only I had time, and more space in my belly, and will power.

Our experience was great. Service was impeccable, food was amazing, and the restaurant itself was pretty cool. I do have to mention that a super winning point for me here is the chef's ability to truly CREATE unique and well paired food dishes. Nothing is like anything you get elsewhere, and nothing is a \"staple\". It's all very handmade, fresh, unique, tasty, interesting and well prepared. I am a huge fan of this and any foodie should definitely visit ASAP!"}
{"text":"Recommended as a great place to go for our anniversary dinner, I knew I was going to like Downtownfood. As we walked up to DTF there was a chalkboard sign outfront saying that they were not Opus. I hadn't even realized they were residing here and fondly remembered my sister's visit to Opus when a shooting took place and she was out front till 4 am giving a witness statement.

I am glad you now live here DTF.

It was a Thursday, it was dead, I had made a reso. Our server was friendly, funny and she kept the bread coming. We decided to go for the tasting menu, and I advised our server of our allergies, scallops, oysters and mussels. She came back to check if lobster was ok, and it was, but despite this the second course was still scallops.
That is why I have to give DTF four instead of 5, if our allergy had been more serious, where we couldn't have picked the scallops out, we would have had a ruined meal.

But the food, it is so good. I can barely remember everything that we had, but the duck ham & cheese really stood out. The lobster cream broth was so good, even though my counterpart could not indulge the scallop portion.

I also really have to respect all the locally sourced food, they are also part of the Vancouver Ocean Alliance, so no net caught fish. 

It really topped off the meal with the dessert course where they had written \"Happy Anniversary\" on the plate, and then we were given mini raspberry macaroons afterward. SO CUTE.

Do be warned, the food is pretty rich, especially if you do 7 courses like we did. Prepare your stomach and try to get over the restaurant name when telling someone who doesn't know what you are talking about."}
