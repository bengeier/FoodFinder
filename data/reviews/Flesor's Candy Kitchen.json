{"text":"Excellent food and wonderful service! The best Reuben sandwich I have ever eaten. And the iced tea is very good and the prices are hard to beat. We will be back :)"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the fresh breakfast called the Flessner special.  We often come here to purchase central Illinois finest chocolates.   Will be back for breakfast again.  

The decor of this place makes it feel like one is stepping back in time to an earlier more friendly place.  I am from out of town yet was greeted by several customers."}
{"text":"Love this place, the atmosphere and people. My daughter took me there for my birthday and they brought me two of the yummy homemade turtle candies, my favorite, and sang to me. Now those people can sing, it was beautiful....:) My only complaint was had breakfast there one other time and wasn`t that pleased with it, but lunch has always been very good. If your ever in Tuscola don`t miss this one."}
{"text":"This place was closed when I was a child.  I remember driving by it and dreaming about all the candy that was once made there and wondering if maybe there was any left behind.  If only I could see inside!  I'm overjoyed that these ladies recognized the value of this place and went to the trouble of restoring it.  They've done an exceptional job with the authentic restoration.  The candy is handmade and old fashioned enough to be sentimental but delicious and exciting for today's palate.  It isn't just a breakfast joint, it's a community treasure.  My grandfather meets his cronies here every morning.  Say hi to them when you stop in."}
{"text":"Everytime I come here I get a ruebin. Its so good I can't look at anything else on the menu. I made the mistake of ordering to go oneday and brought my ruebin into work and I had to share with my coworkers. Sheesh Soldiers can eat. Let's just say they keep asking where I got it. I will never tell LOL!!!! The staff is always welcoming and attentive to the customers and your food is always hot! Oh yeah I almost forgot about the coke. I ordered it for the first time and it was better than buying it from the store. Dont get me started on the fresh chocolate..... So good!!! If you are ever in town please stop in for a sandwich, coke and candy you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"No doubt the place offers back in time atmosphere and as food too, as I had been told, but do not expect the same for the bill."}
{"text":"Old-fashioned soup & sandwich Bistro atmosphere for lunch with an amazing assortment of hand made candies & chocolates to choose from. I also tried the cobbler & ice cream ... Amazing.     Fresh ingredients & home-style cooking. 

Plus the ladies working there are so friendly & nice. Highly recommend this place for lunch & candy shopping."}
{"text":"Hey folks, 
Truthfully, I am a little biased. One: this is my workplace. I am a soda-jour and buser. 
Two: I grew up in Tuscola, therefore, I am a candy kitchen \"local\". 
However, I am a newbee to Yelp, but I thought it rather virtue-less to neglect my own restaurant of a review. If you don't appreciate my partiality you must stop reading now.  

The Candy kitchen is a one-of-kind, gem from your childhood place. We serve only the \"good\" stuff, or should I say the bad stuff (because it is bad for your health). Homemade everything here: Chocolate candies, brittle, nutty bark, coffee bark, caramel in all forms, nutty clusters, ice creams, sundaes, sodas, etc.! Our restaurant is a family owned business, one that has been in the family for three generations and reopened only recently about 10 years ago. Everything in the store is refurbished from its original proceedings way back in 1901. The store is the definition of endearing with a touch of romanticism. Breakfast begins at 6 and goes until 10; Our lunch is served from 11-3! We stay opened until 5. Our menu contains a variety of items ranging from a Gyro and Greek salad (the owners heritage) and a burger! 

The service is fast and we our proud of our place. Home is where the heart is.... (And chocolate, right?) 

P.S. 
List of my favorites include: 
Dark honey salted caramels 
Dark turtles 
Any cluster
Vanilla creams 
Chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream 
Coconut ice cream 
Any milkshake (peanut butter... Yummmm) 
Chocolate soda 
Fruit and nut salad 
Any soup!!! 
Reuben
Gus burger
Tea!"}
{"text":"I took the back roads between champaign and the outlet mall Tuscola.  The food was good and Mama Maria was great!  The staff kept coming by to help put my fussy little ones at ease!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch and the food itself is decent (my BLT and soup was good, but not out of the ordinary) but the old-fashioned sodas and candies are AWESOME.

The atmosphere is really nice, too. It manages to be quaint and small town without being cheesy."}
{"text":"Food was amazing.  Homemade pie with vanilla ice cream was amazing.  The homeade chocolate candy was unreal"}
{"text":"This little ice cream/soda shop is wonderful. Opens at 11am and there are maybe 20 booths and 10 tables. Better hurry, it's seat yourself! There is a \"bar\" available to sit and receive food as well. I had the 1/2 soup and 1/2 sandwich meal with the Vegetable Beef and the B.L.T. Both were amazing although the portions were small. Between two people (with iced teas) our bill was $15. 

However, I dare anyone who enters not to leave without ice cream, a malt, or the tantalizing candy available. Of course I had to purchase the honey salted chocolate covered caramel and the hand dipped peanut butter. 

Definitely get the coffee chocolate bark! It is wonderful!!!"}
{"text":"Old fashioned soda fountain with homemade sodas and ice cream. There is also food and candy but I only tried the soda fountain side. I had a chocolate soda float with vanilla ice cream and it was great!"}
{"text":"Um, this one goes to 11.  Everything is good in the sweets area, and the meat loaf is wunderbar."}
{"text":"As others have pointed out, the inside of this place takes you back to days gone by and a treat in itself just to walk in and take a look.  

For now, this is my initial review and is for the breakfast meal.  We got there at around 9 AM, on a Saturday, morning.  It was not too crowded and appeared most the customers were locals.   The waitress was very friendly.  The breakfast menu is a bit limited, but has the basic fair.  I went with two eggs, sunny side up, sausage patties, home fries smothered in country gravy, and toast.  The eggs, sausage and toast were good. Unfortunately the country gravy was not warm.  In fact, I would venture to say it was below room temperature as some of it was cold to the touch, which kinda of ruined the entire plate.   

However, with that being said I've not given up on this place just yet.  Their lunch menu seems much more extensive.   More importantly they have a huge selection of handmade chocolates and from the pictures posted by my fellow Yelper's,  the ice-cream desserts look wonderful.   I continue to have this placed booked marked for a summer afternoon run.  

We'll be coming back and will update the review then.  See you this summer."}
{"text":"Candy and historic soda fountain charm gets five stars. Food and service is a average four stars. Prepare to wait, this is not fast food. The staff is quirky and they will grow on you, especially one of the owners, Devon. You must try the turtles, they are freshly made on-site and delicious!"}
{"text":"I stopped here on the way down to St. Louis. It was just by chance but it was the cutest little soda and candy shop! We had lunch-I got a club sandwich and my husband got pulled pork and both were great! The staff is super friendly and they give you samples of their home made candy when you dine in and that was delicious too! Love this little gem and hope to return one day!"}
{"text":"Good good chocolate. Nice people that work there too. I did buy several dark chocolate turtles for a gift... They were 'wrapped' in a brown paper bag. Which doesn't bother me since I ended up eating them rather than gifting them. But just an FYI you can probably ask for a box. 
I'd come back though next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Awesome to see an old style candy, soda and ice cream shop still thriving. By far one of the best and busiest in the Midwest. 

I had a simple hot fudge sundae and my wife had a Carmel sundae. Both were good and made with homemade icecream."}
{"text":"I went there with my Wingman and I had the cheeseburger and fries. It was good. Really wasn't to busy but we were waited on quickly. We will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Step back in time with this little ice cream/soda shop in Tuscola!  It's about a five minute drive from the Tanger Outlets.  There's free street parking!!   As soon as you walk in, you see the soda fountains and display cases full of homemade chocolate!   Just past that is the dining area.  I was seated right away and looked over the three page menu.   It took a minute for the waitress to come by with a teeny tiny glass of water.   I read on one of the pages that the owner's are from Greek descent.... so I asked how the gyro was.  She recommended that over the \"Gusburger\".   I took her recommendation and ordered the gyro with potato salad (they didn't offer greek salad or fries as a side) and a strawberry shake (hello?  homemade ice cream!!!).  I looked around and the dining room was full of midwestern families.... all ordered burgers, soup and sandwiches.  I didn't see anyone with a gyro.   The kitchen is open so you can see the cooks behind the high counter cooking up whatever -- I didn't see a spit with the gyro meat..... and all the food came out fast and put under the heat lamp.   My food came out within minutes!   I was slightly disappointed because the gyro meat wasn't freshly sliced from the spit.... it was in uniform slices.... kind of like the kind that's in the frozen food section at Sam's..... and it sort of tasted like it too.... actually, it was tasteless.... the lettuce/tomatoe/onions were super fresh.... and the tzatziki sauce seemed equally underseasoned.   I guess I'll order a salad next time.   The potato salad was decent.... fairly mainstream.  But the real winner here was the strawberry shake.  It cost $3.50.... it probably could easily serve three people.   It came in the metal container with a soda fountain glass.... yah, I filled it to the top THREE times.  The ice cream was wonderful and the milk was fresh!!!  OMG.    My meal was about $9.   Very reasonable.   On the way out, I raided the chocolate counter -- got some of the famous \"Paul's Pecan's\" which are Turtles... OMG.... so good.   Ok, so if you have a sweet tooth -- come here.... definitely!!  This is the only place probably within about 100 miles that serves homemade ice cream.... I mean, not custard (like at Jarling's) but honest to good hard ice cream.  SOOOOO good.  I'd probably be more cautious of lunch next time (this is a Candy Kitchen.... not a diner!)  -- it's not great, but not horrible.... but the ice cream shop.... YAH BABY!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food and candy. The menu was full of options and prices reasonable. We had the BLT and Corn beef sandwich with paste salad.
And of course we shared a chocolate malt.
Also took some turtles with for later."}
{"text":"Totally off the beaten path but worth the effort to get to. If you happen to be shopping at the Tanger (Tuscola) Outlets, you have to make sure to stop here and pick up some treats! Paul's Pecan treats are crave worthy!"}
{"text":"Great food, ice cream & atmosphere!!  Will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten lunch here twice. Beyond cute interior--totally old fashioned and adorable. 

The menu is small but they have a home style feature every day if you don't want one of their regular sandwiches or salads and the prices are fantastic. I had the Reuben the first time and some amazing Greek lasagna thing that I can't spell or pronounce and the most enormous 'side' Greek salad for $6.95 the second time. 

Get a scoop of homemade ice cream for dessert. They'll serve it in a nostalgic little cup with a spoon that will remind you of your grandma.  Or buy your weight in candy--you know, whatever floats your boat. I had mint chocolate chip and ate every bite and I'm not really an ice cream girl. 

Service is friendly and attentive and very fast. 

My one caveat--this is a family business and they close whenever they damn well please regardless of the hours the have posted. I've tried to have lunch 3 other times when they closed more than an hour early each time."}
{"text":"The food is okay. The atmosphere is old time soda fountain. Lots of original stuff in the building. The ice cream is the best you can get. Order lunch but come for desert."}
{"text":"Old-Fashioned candy store and lunch stop. Good little meal but the best part is ending it with a Paul's Pecan treat! Yum! (On a weird wide not the Iced tea here is just plain good!!)"}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful lunch here. I ended up having a carb meltdown and ordered a Reuben platter ($6.95) with potato salad. The Reuben had steamed cabbage instead of sauerkraut which was actually quite delicious. The potato salad was a little heavy on the mayo side; however, there was plenty of chopped bacon, so that made up for it. I also ventured to the chocolate counter and bought some candy corn, salted caramels, and mint patties. Yum yum.

I bummed a few sips of a chocolate milkshake ($3.50) from the hubs -- it was really good! Just FYI -- one milkshake order is enough for two people. Unless you're a big fatty like me and want it all for yourself. That's okay, too."}
{"text":"So happy we found Flesor's for breakfast. Such a unique place with character you don't find often.  The service and food was great, my wife had an omelet and I had the french toast. We were just passing through and spent the night in town and discovered it when searching for someplace to have breakfast. It's only about 5 minutes from the outlet mall, so you should certainly take the time to visit. The handmade candy is out outstanding. This will definitely be a stop any time we are in the area."}
{"text":"We stopped in here on our way down i-57 just wandering through little towns.  This was such a pleasant surprise.  Great candies, turtles, caramels, toffee.  It was all delicious.  They also still hand make sodas at the counter.  It feels like going back in time. Hopefully next time we'll be able to grab lunch here!"}
{"text":"The amazing homemade candy, ice cream and food are worth the drive! The staff is friendly and the building is beautifully restored. I don't buy chocolate any where else!"}
{"text":"This a great place to eat. They have great Philly Cheese Steaks, Rubens, Potato Salad, Italian Beef, and especially candy. But the shining light of this place is by far the soda. They have great green rivers, chocolate sodas with chocolate ice cream, and so much more. And they make the soda right there in front of you! A women named Devin and her sister Ann own it. After lunch, Devin was very nice and decided that she would take our party back into the room where they make candy and how and when their most candy is sold. 

Here, they have a great family atmosphere, great food, and great service."}
{"text":"This place is darling!!

We go to Tuscola at least a couple times a year for the outlet mall, but on our way today my husband had me look for an ice cream place, and we got to experience a little of the sweetness of downtown Tuscola. I love seeing little towns being brought back to life, and there's a lot of that going on here!

We had already had lunch, unfortunately, so we didn't get to try any of the food. But we will be coming back for sandwiches next time we are in town!

We sat at the counter and enjoyed the atmosphere and old-timey ambiance. My son totally loved his first ever ice cream soda (strawberry!) from the soda fountain, and the rest of us had phenomenal hand-dipped homemade ice cream.  My teen daughters had lemon chiffon, my husband had red raspberry, and I had a very rich Paul's Pecan Favorite (turtle). They were all delicious.

We had the loveliest conversations with the lady working the candy counter, and bought a few of the amazing homemade candies--caramels, peanut butter puddings, orange cream gummy bears, and cherry sours. And we drooled over all the others we saw! 

It was all-around delightful, and we will surely go back every time we go to Tuscola!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the soda but the food isn't that great but that's just my opinion. I've had better!"}
{"text":"Open 11-3, be sure to check out the daily special, along with a Green River or a Chocolate Malt.  But leave room for a salted dark chocolate covered caramel too!  YUM!"}
{"text":"Stopped in before we did some outlet shopping. The food was very good. Hubby almost always orders a BLT no matter where we go. He said this one actually had enough bacon (can there ever be enough bacon?). He ordered coleslaw for the side, also good. I ordered the Italian Beef - excellent and more than enough, took some home. Added a side of pasta salad - the best I've had! A little sweet and oh so good!  We will definitely return. The service was friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the old time feel with all the modern amenities. Food was cooked from scratch and cooked to order!!! Soda fountain is the old fashioned way - soda - add syrup or syrups of your choice to come up with any flavor combo!!!
Candy - oh my, the candy - you name it, they have dipped it in chocolate.......
And don't forget the homemade ice cream..... OH YUM!!!!"}
{"text":"What an adorable spot for breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, you name it. Lucky I turned to yelp when I did for lunch during my roadtrip to Nashville through rural Illinois!

I saw the menu and it seemed pretty basic American food/diner food. I got the cheeseburger with all the fixings and the boyfriend chose a turkey BLT. Looking at the pictures of the menu, I thought the prices must have been from at least a decade ago. But nope, that's just the old town feel and prices for most all the lunch prices were under $7! Couldn't believe it.

Service was great even though they had a packed house (on a Thursday afternoon!).

I would be happy to come back here to support this mom and pop shop whenever in the neighborhood. They also have an instagram worthy wall outside! 

This establishment was what America feels like."}
{"text":"Not much to say about this place other than it's all round amazing!
Prices: Very cheap
Service: Excellent
Ice cream: Amazing
-Couple's Critic"}
{"text":"Best home made candy and food in the middle of Amish country. Candy recipes passed down through generations and the authentic soda fountain are worth the drive to Tuscola. You will not regret stopping in any day, except Sunday'"}
{"text":"The ice cream was great but the customer service was HORRIBLE. Before I got the ice cream I asked the cashier if they accepted American Express and she said that they did, however, when I went to pay, she was extremely rude and pushed my card away and began to lecture me about how I should never pay with a credit card for something that's under two dollars (because they get a service charge) and that it wasn't even worth it for me to pay. She then asked me in a condescending voice \"Do you understand what I am saying to you?\". Luckily, my friend stepped in and offered to pay for me but I will NEVER go back simply because of this instance. I do not believe the woman would have been so rude to me if I wasn't a teenager. She completely embarrassed me in front of my friends and none of us will ever go back."}
{"text":"This is a cute place and you will get a nice greeting at the door and as you leave if you are white! (I observed this as I sat and watched). My experience wasn't to great, I thought it would be nice to stop here with my family as we were Driving back from EIU, I should have spent my money somewhere else. I was very disappointed when we walked in the people looked at us as if we were in the wrong place Out of all the employees standing around only one young lady said sit where you would like. My chicken had no flavor, I paid $60 for a cheese burger, bbq sandwich and two chicken platters which included a salad and the reason I gave two stars was because the Mac n cheese was good. This place is overrated service sucked food is mediocre!"}
{"text":"Wonderful lunch or dessert spot! The decor adds to the experience. It took a little while to get our check, but our server apologized profusely and gave us each a complimentary chocolate turtle which were the most DEVINE I have ever tasted. It was a busy Saturday during lunch and we didn't have to wait that long for the check but that extra effort of customer service impressed me. Our sandwiches were great (and cheap!) and I will for sure be back."}
{"text":"Step back in time... Old time soda fountain, friendly counter service.   We tried the cherry coke and green river.. Felt like we had stepped into a scene from it's A Wonderful  life.   Next time will have to have more time and try the ice cream...."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out since it had pretty reviews. I got the special of the day which was the baked chicken and a side of 5 cheese macaroni. The macaroni was pretty good...and that's where it stops. Chicken was very dry and bland, salad was very crap. I've had better salads at McDonald's, so what does that say about this salad? So over all, this place is ehh. I've had better.

Two baked chicken breast, with Mac side. One BBQ pulled pork sandwich and plain cheeseburger with side bags of chips. Three ice cream sundaes equals to $61!
Definitely definitely not worth the price. Go to Wendy's get a burger and a frosty from there.  This place is overrated!!!
 
Gave it one star cuz I couldn't give it a zero."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. The food was okay. The ice cream and fountain drinks are GREAT and the service is poor and slow.

We'll be back but beware of busy sundays!"}
{"text":"We went to the Candy kitchen for a quick family lunch, and knowing that my options would be limited due to allergies, I wasn't sure what to expect.  The owner, Devin, was super helpful. I ended up with a bunless burger (par for the course for me) but there were no sides on the menu that I could eat due to being allergic to milk. Devon put together a fruit plate for me to make sure that I had a full meal. She also made me chocolate sauce to put over the fruit which made me feel very special. What a wonderful experience!!"}
{"text":"Great soda fountain here. Can't comment on the food though because the server ignored my table completely after taking our drink orders. We waited there for a half hour as she looked after the guests at the tables next to ours. Eventually we walked out. Wasn't worth the drive from Champaign."}
{"text":"Flesor's is beyond a doubt one of my favorite places on earth. Homemade candy, just exactly like grandma's and that includes melt in your mouth divinity and fudge.

The soda fountain remains in all its glory and you can dine in the adorable cafe. Tin ceiling. Tile floor. Marble counters. This place is the same place where your grandparents or great grands met and fell in love. And you will too. With a Flesor's and it's historic wonderfulness. Make it a destination stop!"}
{"text":"Found this place on a trip using Yelp and was a pleasant surprise! Nice looking old time soda shop atmosphere and candy shop. Had a malt that was great and bought a box of assorted chocolates that were great too! Cool place."}
{"text":"This is the first time we had breakfast here and it is well worth the drive.  I had the western omelet and it was the best I've ever eaten, including mine. (I make a pretty mean omelet. ) The vegetables were cooked to perfection,  cooked through,  but crisp."}
{"text":"Sandwiches were ok.  I had the Philly Cheesesteak and it was tasty.  Someone nearby had the turkey club which looked much more impressive.  Sandwich envy....

The big winners here for me were the chocolate malt, the pecan turtles and the AMBIENCE.  The tile floor is absolutely adorable and loved all the antiques.  

Lots of regulars coming in and getting hugs from the servers who asked a few if they were having their usual today.  CUTE!"}
{"text":"Husband and I were out Geocaching in the area found this place with yelp. Is open on Sundays and had sandwiches to take along. Yeah!"}
