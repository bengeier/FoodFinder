{"text":"For Frozen Yogurt..... It's alright!!

I bought 4 different flavors: 
Original (tart) - more sweet than tart...
Nutella: good, very good taste of hazelnut ... Marshmallow: no particular taste; just cold in your mouth
Vanilla Beans: no particular taste...
 
I'm used to a \"Tart\" and \"fruity\" tastes when it comes to Frozen Yogurt... At Menchie's, their products are more on the milky and sweeter taste... Also, there are more deserts flavors than fruit flavors..

It's not the best I've tasted ..."}
{"text":"Awesome little spot !

Super nice service that greeted us and explained how it worked ! 
Would come back :)"}
{"text":"Menchie's is defiantly our favorite spot for frozen yogurt. No trip to the West Island is complete without a stop at Menchie's and thanks to their generous opening hours there is hardly a time that you'll pull up and find them closed.  

They have a wide variety of frozen yogurt and sorbets to choose from in a self-serv format and tons of topping to add to your selection. Everything is sold by weight so you can have as much or as little as everything that you want. My favorite is the Purely Tart with Skor topping.  For frequent fliers don't forget to ask for a Smileage Card.

They also have a location in Brossard at Dix/30"}
{"text":"I love their frozen yogurt, I think they have great flavours and i like how you can personalize it with toppings. They have really cute colourful spoons and they also have a points card you can use if you go there often. The only downside is that it can get quite expensive as they price you based on weight. So if you're not aware of how much you are putting in your cup, you may be shocked at how much you have to pay."}
{"text":"Great selection of flavors and toppings. The staff is friendly and the establishment is always clean. One thing I would suggest is more seating!!"}
