{"text":"The best rice you'll ever have; the mixed platter to go along with it is a perfect meal when you're craving shawarma"}
{"text":"Walk by this place often and it's usually empty but the other day I decided to check it out. I like supporting the local guy and always hope that perhaps I will stumble upon one of those hidden gems in Toronto. Sadly to say, this place was NOT one of them. I ordered the chicken shawarma plate and it was....well.... very underwhelming. I so so so wanted it to be amazing but as I picked my way through the bland rice, weirdly sauced red potatoes (also bland), uninspiring salad (bland) and flavourless chicken (the most bland), I just couldn't find any love for it and stopped eating the 3/4 full container that was left. The staff were extremely nice so any previous post you read that mentions this point, I can 100% attest to that, but the food? Sigh. Tasteless and boring. Sorry, Big Pita. If you just worked on revamping your recipes and put that real amazingly flavourful Mediterranean magic into your food, I truly feel that your place would be a lot less empty."}
{"text":"We got to the St. Lawrence Market just as it closed, but we were still hungry, so we tried Big Pita, a block away. WOW! What a delightful meal. I had the chicken souvlaki dinner -- which featured tender chicken breast cubes that had been cooked on a skewer, along with rice, potatoes in a delicious sauce, salad, and, I think, a little hummus and tahini. The flavors all mixed together so nicely -- peppers and pickles and sauces and chicken, and so on. It was so much better than I expected. Too bad I don't live in Toronto and can't eat here more often."}
{"text":"The food is about average shawarma takeout, but the price is significantly more than most shawarma places I've been to. For instance, a \"medium\" plate was about $10 after tax. At other places I could get a MUCH larger portion for $7."}
{"text":"We stumbled into this placed while on vacation and the food was delicious and freshly prepared. We had a lot of questions and the young server behind the counter took the time to explain the menu and answer all of our questions. The food was extremely good and we were extremely happy with everything that we ordered."}
{"text":"Rushing to St Lawrence market only to miss out on end-of-day sales at 6 PM, I ended up walking around looking for something to eat.  Walking further down Front St, I see a Pizza Pizza, a McDonalds, and a Big Pita. Never heard of Big Pita before, and on the front door they were advertising cheap deals for $5.99 and $6.99, so I decided to take a look.  It's a small family business with seating for about 16. Owner says they've been here for almost 2 years now. He was pretty chill about allowing me to take pictures. Many of the customers that came in seem to be regulars.  Their menu is limited, but they specialize in shawarma wraps or plates and salad. They also have a couple sides available that don't seem to be on the menu. Prices are ok depending on what you're getting.  Food is prepared pretty fast, and you can customize what you want in your meal. The portions aren't too bad for the price, and I'm not sure how many other shawarma places there are in the area so this is probably one of the more affordable places if you're craving it. The taste was ok.  If you're looking for something that's healthier than McDonalds or Pizza Pizza next door, this isn't a bad place."}
{"text":"I know this is my first review but I'm a long time Yelp user. This place was so bad that I finally broke my lazy streak to write this. Trust me, just not good."}
{"text":"This place just doesn't stand out. It is alway empty although it is on Front st. with many other restaurants, a grocery store, and St. Lawrance market nearby.   Other than a friendly service, nothing much to say. I have had better Shawarma elsewhere. The portion is OK, limited menus to choose from, not the cheapest meal either. I would rather go to fast food joints near this place."}
{"text":"I've never tried anything here except for the shawarma plate but I can say with confidence it's better than a lot of places I've been to - definitely one of my favourites. The shawarma quality is great. Most places I go to the chicken is too fatty, too dry, or has hard pieces in it. This one is, 9 out of 10 times,cooked to perfection. The service is amazing too, lovely family business. The young man learned my order after just the first visit and you can tell they have a good base of regulars because of this kind of receptive service."}
{"text":"The customer service was exceptional, the food was quick and very tasty, overall my husband and I love this place! If we are ever on this side of town again and are hungry we will definitely come back! Thank you!"}
{"text":"What a day, jacks took 20 minutes to not be seen, BK was closed. Fortune ended up smiling on me. I got a stuffed salad with chicken and a pop for $14...   Fast and friendly counter service. I wouldn't have gone into this place, but again, I'm glad I did. Seating is limited during lunch, 6 little round tables, double chairs.  Come try..."}
