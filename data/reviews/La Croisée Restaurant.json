{"text":"Excellent restaurant of fine French cuisine prepared by a Chef coming from Dijon in the South East of France. 
We had the opportunity to taste different dishes : boeuf bourguignon, ris de veau, magret de canard aux asperges, sole. All were perfectly cooked and very tasty. We also had some nice bottles of Burgundy wine that were a rather good value for money. The detail that makes the difference : warm slices of baguette with truffle flavoured butter ( beurre au truffes )"}
{"text":"Great Food, nice to find a place in Toronto where the food is not over seasoned. Ive tried half the menu items and cant pick which is my favourite! Will recommend them to my pickiest friends."}
{"text":"Had a groupon for this place so decided to try it out with my friend. The restaurant is located in the middle of a nice strip of restaurants along Bayview south of Eglinton. The decor and ambience of the restaurant is nice and romantic. It's a great place for a date but maybe not a party since the restaurant is not very big. 

They serve French cuisine and the service was great here, even though we didn't speak French. They gave us complimentary appetizers of scallop in a sauce and a cheese puff w truffle butter, which went great w the crispy bread they gave us. My friend and I shared an escargot appetizer that was served on a sweet shortbread cookie. The taste was interesting, although I might prefer for it to be salty. For the main entre I had the grilled lamb rack which had a sweet sauce. The lamb was pretty good although a little too fatty.

Overall the service was pretty good, they keep asking if we wanted water or bread. The food is good but you will need to find street parking close by."}
{"text":"4.5 !! It was such a nice cozy restaurant. Perhaps you will get a taste of Paris if you sat outside whilst sipping a little wine :) 

Was here w/ my friend as we had a Groupon ($25 for $50 worth of food). We had...

Escargot de Bourgogne - This was served with 6 or so pcs of snails with a sweet cookie & snow peas. It tasted good together. However, I think I might prefer the conventional escargot more... 

Poulet Basquaise - Basquaise chicken with fresh summer vegetables. This was nice with the sauce. Perhaps I should have been more adventurous though. The veggies were surprisingly tasty as well & was placed brilliantly in a crunchy phyllo(?) type pastry bowl.

Cotes D'agmeau - Grilled lamb rack with summer green peas. Not sure about the peas, but this was so tasty!! Cooked to perfection & about a med. rare. I loved it. Trimmed the fat off but loved it and wanted to savour it all. 

Service was excellent. They kept checking with us & other tables to make sure everything was alright. I would love to be back again... I hope my hubby's reading this :)"}
