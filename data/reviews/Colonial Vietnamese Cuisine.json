{"text":"What a great surprise.  Three of us had dinner here.  The restaurant was clean and modern.  The staff were professional, friendly and they knew their dishes.  We had salad rolls, cocnut shrimp, green chile mussels to start.  The salad rolls were some of the best we have had.  The shrimp was ok, and the the mussels were excellent.  The entrees were terrific and all three of us enjoyed them.  I had the rice vermicelli bowl with chicken.  It was a first rate presentation of quality food.  the pan fried salmon was also a hit.  As well, the waiter recommended a white wine which my ffriends raved about.  The waiter told us that the menu was being upgraded to add steak and lobster.   One improvement suggestion - move to cloth napkins rather than paper.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Living in SE Calgary doesn't grant us with many Thai options or Asian food in general. I was pleasantly surprised to stumble on Colonial, and my craving was set on thai.  I give this restaurant a 4/5 stars on interior design with attention to detail. You can tell the owners take pride in a contemporary dining experience. Small things like their clear glass tea pot to placing a lotus flower in all of their dishes (which I would argue is a nice touch, but unnecessary).  My rating drops to a 3 star because the quality of the entrees I had (mostly thai curry) didn't quite match it's presentation.  I love their tea selection. A mini-David Tea selection."}
{"text":"This is a very convenient Vietnamese restaurant downtown which I tried for lunch recently.  I tried a couple items: Coconut shrimp, fried calamari, salad rolls and the chicken vermicelli bowl with spring rolls.   I found the coconut shrimp to be overly battered and very greasy - as we the fried calamari. The salad rolls were interesting and not what I expected. They didn't have any vermicelli in them and were filled with mint and romaine with shrimp and that was all.   The rice noodle bowl was quite tasty and was a huge portion. It was presented with a full chicken breast on top with a generous portion of noodles, the usual veggies and 2 spring rolls cut up - this bowl was also seasoned with mint.  It was pretty tasty but different than the usual Vietnamese experience."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how long this place has been open but it's new to me so I was pretty excited to try it.  I tend to like a light soup for lunch and it seems that I'm always in search of a great place.   We came here just before noon on a Friday and the place was pretty full, but we had no trouble getting a seat.  Sat down and noticed the water was already waiting on the tables for us.  In fact, the water was waiting on every table.  I'm not sure how much I like that idea.  Not only was it room temperature, it kind of makes you think about people walking by your table before you get there and sneezing.  That being said, I drank mine during the meal and reached over to the next empty table and stole theirs.  I would have preferred if someone would have refilled mine but they seemed pretty busy and not quite used to the crowds. We ordered the Coconut Prawns as an appetizer and it came pretty quick.  I enjoyed it, but I don't know if I enjoyed it $3.00 per prawn.   I had the Satay Chicken Pho, well that's what I ordered anyway.  What showed up was beef.  I hope.  The meat was raw. (I know, I know, which is how they serve beef Pho)  I just don't think I've ever had chicken served that way.  I ate it, thinking it looked like beef, hoping that it was.  It was ok for flavor.  Nothing I will rush back for, but good enough to try again. My wife had a beef vermicelli bowl and she said that once the flavors all mixed together it was pretty good. This place was ok.  It did not knock my socks off but I'm sure in the Ultra-competitive downtown market they will either improve or be replaced."}
{"text":"A great little find in Art Central!  After walking by a number of times, I finally decided to give Colonial a try for lunch today.  Considering it was a Friday right before noon, the restaurant was not overly busy and we were seated right away.  The service was quite fast, and we received our dishes right away - beef pho and the prawn vermicelli bowl.  The food and service were both great.  A great spot for lunch - we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Colonial Vietnamese is a great place for a business lunch.  As a huge fan of Vietnamese food, I'm always in search of the best place. Colonial is a great place for lunch or dinner but expect to pay for it. While there are lots of options available, I don't believe such a greater price is worth the difference in quality from other Vietnamese places. I guess you are paying more for the service and restaurant decor at this place. All in all, I'm still a big fan and will likely be back for another business lunch in the future.  Good food and better service at corporate prices."}
{"text":"Stopped here one mid afternoon for a snack while shopping downtown.  My husband and I shared an order of fresh hot spring rolls and an order of prawn salad rolls. The spring rolls were so hot , we had to wait for them to cool down.  Tasted wonderful ! The salad rolls were not quite done right and the skin was tough and maybe not soaked in water properly when made.  But when we told them this - they compensated with an order of complementary ice cream - which was very nice of them. I was impressed with the way the food was served - with a beautiful orchid on the side of the dish or the name of the restaurant on the edge of the bowl. I would definitely come back for a meal next time and find that these little special presentation touches do make this restaurant more special than the regular dining places.  It is close to the Hyatt Hotel and the food is good even if a bit more pricey."}
