{"text":"This was a typical resort restaurant the food was fairly ambitious and the food was pricey. I had the chicken because almost any other entree was really pricey, and almost solidly steak. Never the less the food was pretty good and the service was great. Unfortunately the table next to us lit up and then it was pretty smokey, but we were already done, and we chose to sit outside so that I don't blame them for at all. In the end it was a little too pricey for what your gonna get, some good food but also it was the resort and I wouldn't expect anything different. I probably won't be back, our server was really nice though that's the only reason I feel bad about giving this place 3 stars. Other than that it was all around ok."}
{"text":"The brunch suffers from too many flies over the cold foods. Time for some good fans and attention to the problem"}
{"text":"Went there last night for date night and had a great meal.  I felt the meal was slightly over priced but with a restaurant.com coupon it was a good deal.  The guacamole is made table side and delicious.   We had the steak with pistachio butter and pecan crusted pork chop on cornbread waffle.   Both were delicious.  It was not busy for a Friday night.  We should have sat outside, but opted for interior."}
{"text":"Sorry folks.... but the all food in Arizona restaurants sucks.... Want good food come to Memphis!!!
All food here is bland with no flavor. So this was not a knock on this restaurant but all the food out here!!!!  But y'all (y'all a southern term) do have a clean and beautiful state!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was ok and the staff were friendly but very too pricey for what they have to offer. We ordered two Maple Salman and a cup of coffee,for the starter we ordered one guacamole (made of 1.5 avacodo) and chips. We ended up spending $70 . The Maple syrup is too sweet and doesn't really go well with the kale but the Salman itself tasted fresh. The next day we chose another dining options."}
{"text":"I stopped in this restaurant a few times while staying the week at the Hyatt. 
Most of the food is delicious. I enjoyed the table side guacamole, chicken tortilla soup and the smoked pork tacos. 
I also tried the shrimp taco -okay, but I wish I would've stuck with the pork. The grilled chicken club sandwich was almost inedible - I ended up taking the sandwich apart and avoiding the chicken altogether. 
The service was wonderful. I sat inside a few times and then outside for a lunch. A man was walking around with the owl and told us about her story. It was really cool sitting out in the scenic yard and then taking pictures with the owl!"}
{"text":"We stayed at the Hyatt Gainey Ranch during spring break and had a fabulous time. We ate at SWB for lunch and enjoyed it so much we ordered dinner that evening to eat in the room with our kids. My husband ordered me the chocolate caramel tart which turned out to be one of the best desserts I've ever had. I tried looking for the recipe and couldn't find it so I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask for it. Surprisingly I received an almost immediate response from the hotel that they would let the chef know. Within a few hours the recipe from the chef was in my e-mail with additional tips! Now I call that customer service. We loved the hotel and loved the restaurant. Looking forward to going back someday."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner on our 2nd anniversary and had a fantastic time!  

I wish I'd gotten our server's name.  She was very friendly, and very attentive at all the right moments.  The food was great, and our server comped our dessert for our anniversary.  

After dinner, we listened to the jazz band for quite a while and really enjoyed the atmosphere.

My only criticism?  Try not to seat people by the sliding door to the patio.  :) The heat blew in every time a server passed through.  We were immediately moved to another table as soon as we mentioned it .

We will be back!"}
{"text":"We ordered seabass and ribs. Both excellent choices. Service very good. Ambiance was unexpected. Felt like we were in hawaii with an open feel with palm trees. Used restaurant.com coupon. Great deal."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick lunch salad. The menu described a satisfying southwest Caesar Salad with a chipotle Caesar dressing, grilled corn, and garlic croutons. The salad came decently presented, however it was not crisp or cold. It was room temp., bordering on warm, with a slight sweet after taste from the dressing, and flavorless corn. The worst part? Soft, sweet, corn bread type croutons that were FAR from the crunchy, salty, garlic flavor one would expect from croutons intended to add flavor and texture to salads."}
{"text":"Good food, pricey, very loud, lots of kids, OK service, atmosphere of a coffee shop."}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me to the \"Wine Me, Dine Me\" experience there for my birthday. I have to say it was one of the best meals I have ever had! It was a unique 4 course meal that Chef Jayson whipped up for us. The  \"Wine Me, Dine Me\" menu changes daily so you can go as many times as you like and never have the same dish. 

You sit at a kitchen bar table overlooking the chefs in the kitchen and you are able to interact with them, ask questions, etc. Make sure you reserve in advance for this experience because the table only holds up to 3 couples so it's very intimate. We were the only couple there and we had a great time joking around with the Chefs.

The service was above reproach and all of the staff was friendly and very helpfull.  I particularly enjoyed the premium tequilla and wine pairings that they selected for the meal.  There is a lounge upstairs and when we went they had a live jazz band playing which filtered down and added to the overall experience. 

They said they have a Sunday brunch so I am looking forward to trying that next  :)"}
{"text":"I went for Sunday Brunch. It was pretty decent. It was a bit pricey. They had a fairly large selection for brunch items. It's great for picky eaters or for people who like a little of everything (like myself). 

They had some of the standard breakfast items like an omelette station, bacon, sausage, plain pancakes and blueberry pancakes, fruit, smoked salmon. There was a streusel fruit bar that was pretty good. 

Some of the food I wanted to try there looked like it had been there all morning, & dried out. If they weren't dried out, they did sound good. I was excited when I saw they had cheese blintzes, as I love them. They were average. The filling needed a tiny bit more sugar, and a little more vanilla. I love eggs Benedict, but they also looked dried out. The hollandaise sauce on it looked really crusted over. 

The cocktail shrimp was really great. They were huge, not overcooked, and they weren't overly salty. It was super yummy. I also loved the crab legs. They also were not overcooked and since they were cut in half already, it was much easier to eat. 

They had sushi. I tried the spicy tuna and the vegetable roll. The spicy tuna could have had a bit more spice to it. The vegetable roll was avocado and cucumber. It tasted as good as expected, there were no surprises. 

There was a nice antipasto spread. There were slices of chorizo, prosciutto, cheese, different cold salads. I was pleased with the mozzarella and heirloom tomato salad. There was a perfect amount of balsamic vinegar and basil. 

I tried the pork quesadilla. It was really salty and greasy. It was definitely not my favorite. The guacamole with it didn't really have a lot of flavor. 

At the carving station, the beef was completely overdone. They didn't have anything \"medium\", only well done. The flavor was nice, aside from being overcooked. 

There was a shrimp and chorizo macaroni and cheese. It was pretty good. It had a bit of spice from the chorizo, so it had more depth than just a shrimp Mac & cheese. 

For the desserts they had a very pretty set up. There were a few different items to choose from: fruit tarts, cream puffs, chocolate mousse cups, martini glasses of raspberry mousse & chocolate mousse, coffee cake, pumpkin pie, & chocolate cakes. I had a chocolate dipped cream puff. The pastry cream was cooked too thick for my liking. It also didn't have enough vanilla. 

The bananas foster station was nice. I love having dessert stations at brunch. The pastry cook had decent proportions of everything, so there weren't any overpowering flavors. It was really good, no complaints here. 

I love bottomless mimosas. It's an additional $7 from the brunch price, but as long as you have more than one, it's worth it. 

Service was lovely. They were at the table enough to keep the quality of the service good, but not overbearing.  

Overall, I think their Sunday Brunch must be better on other days. I'd probably come back again. It was pretty good for a random Sunday. It must be amazing on holidays."}
{"text":"After reading reviews on yelp, i decided to try out  SWB since we were staying at the Hyatt. It didnt disappoint. We were greeted by a welcoming hostess and seated by the window as requested. And, as reviewers below mentioned, i purchased the restaurant.com gift certificate which came in pretty handy. For starters, we ordered the freshly made guacamole and corn chips which were made table side. We also got the Seared Chili Marinated Shrimp and Scallops. It was pretty good and a good mini tapas. For our entree, we ordered the Oven Roasted Sea Bass and Smoked Baby Back Ribs. I really enjoyed our sea bass. It was poached and smothered in this awesome salsa. The ribs were great as well, super juicy and big chunky slices. For our sides, we got mac & cheese and jack cheese grits. OMG, mac and cheese was awesome. It had a sweet kick to it because of the ham and peas. Mmm.. to accompany our meal, we ordered a bottle of Chateau st. michele chardonnay. We weren't able to finish our meal so they packaged it all up for it along with the wine. It made a great breakfast the next day.  Make sure you get your gift certificate before you dine though. It's always nice to eat well and save $$$."}
{"text":"I got to know SWB very well. This was the only restaurant that served lunch in the Hyatt Regency... So I went there almost daily during my stay. The \"peaches\" include:
_shrimp tacos. They were flavorful and delicious. They came with this mango salsa which added a nice element to the dish. With 3 full-sized tacos, this was a very filling meal
_brunch. On Sundays they have brunch, which included a wide variety of items. it was a nice deviation from the regular menu and allowed me to experiment with different combinations

the \"pits\":
_chicken Caesar salad. it wasn't good...it wasn't bad...it was very mediocre. i wouldn't get it again
_brunch. yes, this was both a peach and a pit. while i loved the concept and the variety, i found that a lot of the options were sitting out for a while...perhaps they can make smaller options to have more frequent turnover?

the in between:
_guacamole. they had table side guac, which in my past experience you can't go wrong...but i feel like i did this time! I think the table side options opens the guac up to a lot of interesting additions from fresh seasonings, cilantro, etc. but it seemed like there was a pre-made spice serving and just half a lime and that's it. don't get me wrong...i ate it (which is why it isn't \"pit\"-worthy) but it wasn't special at all.

Overall...if you're staying at the Hyatt Regency, i'm pretty sure it's inevitable that you will encounter this restaurant at some point. the friendly staff and overall ambiance make for a satisfactory experience."}
{"text":"I had a great dinner there.  One of my best in a long time.  It was sucha treat.  Once in a while you have to take care of yourself and just enjoy what life has to offer.  

Chef Juan was great to talk to.  Seems this guy has been there sinsr they broke ground.  

If you truely like yourself take a walk around the grounds after dinner and smoke a cigar at the big Fire Pit or over by the dock.

Life is good."}
{"text":"What an incredible experience.  They sit you at a counter, overlooking the kitchen, watching chef Juan do his magic.  For $65  you get a great four course meal, a shot of good tequila and 3 nice wines to go with the  wonderful food.  It's called the \"Wine Me Dine Me\"  Not only that, I mentioned that the ceviche looked really good.  Even though it wasn't on our menu, he whipped up a small plate for me.  Terrific.  We had a running conversation with the chefs and learned all about their backgrounds.  All in all, one of our favorite dining experiences.
Ron B."}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you are staying at the hotel and  you don't want to take the car and drive someplace else. Several of us tried the Strauss burger and salmon burger and Cobb salad. They had these unique french fries called Rosemary jalapeño french fries.  They were very tasty. They also made guacamole tableside added it to your chips and salsa. We were able to eat outside. It was a great lunch."}
{"text":"We had a great time at Wine Me Dine Me! We came for a bachelorette/birthday celebration and Marlin, Jesus, Luis, Mama, and Jeremy took the most amazing care of our party! Jeremy was especially thoughtful and we can't wait to come back! Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"My fiancee and I have been here twice, and both times we have been blown away.

Today we came in for Sunday Brunch.  It's a little pricey ($45 per person), but includes delicious/strong bottomless mimosas, amazing breakfast food, outstanding lunch food, and ridiculously good desserts, too!

Service is always fantastic.  Very friendly, and very quick.

If it's not too hot, sit outside.  You're right by the pool, and the sounds of waterfalls are very relaxing.  

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So, it's a resort restaurant. But it could be much better. In spite of the fact the place was nearly empty, we were told there was no room and that all tables had been reserved. Fine. I get that. We get that. So we left our name, number, and room number, and had a drink in the central area bar. And waited. And waited. Finally, I went back to check and the hostess said, \"oh we've been trying to call you but we obviously wrote down the wrong number.\" Hmm. They had our name and our room number; they could've figured out how to get a hold of us. And then, the same tables that were empty an hour and ten minutes before were still empty. Hmm. No way to treat anyone, let alone diamond members. Alas."}
{"text":"Had excellent eggs Benedict for late breakfast. Delish!!  Southwest style. So good.  Huge portion. Could be split easily.  Service great too. Husband had a regular scrambled eggs meal. All perfect!!  Sat outside by fire pit.  Birds were entertaining too. Give it 5!"}
{"text":"When I went it was very crowded and it took a while to be seated. The breakfast is not very traditional American, it has a very latin/southwest style to it. The name is not deceiving. 

It was some of the best breakfast I've ever had though. The atmosphere was lovely and you could sit outside by a fire pit that gave off a hickory smell. It was just wonderful. That hotel is just the perfect atmosphere to enjoy this little bistro."}
{"text":"Fantastic dining! Try the wine me dine me experience, it's a must. We enjoyed it so much we've come back multiple times now. Chef Juan is a fantastic chef and is personable and adds to the entire experience. The tequila and smoked hickory salt at the start sets the mood for the experience. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Family came in from New York - and breakfast at the Hyatt has become something of a tradition for my cousins.
We met here on a Friday mid-morning, and all four of us opted for the buffet.
Nice selection of pastry, fruit, bacon, sausage, pancakes, scrambled eggs, eggs Benedict, made to order omelets and bagels with smoked salmon and all the expected add-ons for that.
Nice strong Bloody Mary, flavorful coffee, and a lovely morning out on the patio.

Yes - you are paying resort prices. That said - if seated outside, you have a view of one of my favorite resorts in town.

Not something I can afford to do daily - and not something I'd want to. But for a nice change of pace - and a way to welcome my cousins to Arizona for this too-brief visit, it was perfect."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast two days in a row at SWB during a weekend stay at the Hyatt Scottsdale. It's the only sit down restaurant on property to grab breakfast. We were lucky enough to have an awesome waitress named Amy who just happened to also be from Hawaii where we're from. We decided to sit outside on the patio as the weather was still nice enough to enjoy sitting in the shade. 

Here's what we enjoyed:

Huevos rancheros - My husband loved this dish with crispy tortillas and even though I usually don't care for a heavy breakfast, I too thought it was wonderful too!

\"Oscar\" Crab eggs Benedict - This came served on bread instead of a traditional English muffin. It was Southwestern style crab hash with bell peppers and hollandaise sauce.

Yogurt parfait with granola and fresh fruit - What kind of dork orders yogurt parfait while on vacation? This dork right here and it was everything I wanted! Light, healthy and keeps my body beach ready 365 days a year.

Loaded hash - I mistakenly ordered this instead of listening to my instinct to get the steel cut oats. It was too heavy for me to enjoy, but if you love a good potato hash with the kitchen sink in it and eggs over easy, this is the dish for you."}
{"text":"Terrible food! We dropped in for a friends birthday, hoping for something special since it was inside the Hyatt. We ordered two mediocre salads as well as chicken tacos that were gross! The cheese on the tacos was in edible. Our service was tolerable, however, I would not recommend this place for anyone."}
{"text":"This was the main restaurant at the resort that was open for all meals. A decent selection, but huge portions, which I found frustrating as for me it's a waste. I can't save anything as I have no microwave to re-heat it. And again being at the resort it's pricey so makes the waste seem worse. 

They were accommodating enough to make me a gluten free pasta one night, which wasn't on the menu. It was disappointing though. Very bland and not much meat in it. Still nice of them to go out of their way. 

Food was pretty good, got boring eating there the whole time though."}
{"text":"Wasn't disappointed with anything here. Went in cautious, but was so pleasantly surprised at ever meal.. Tasty, fresh breakfasts and lunches were well worth the slightly over priced menus. 
I highly recommend the guacamole. And pleaz get some salsa too. 
Yum."}
{"text":"I actually ordered from the adjoining bar Cantina Due. Service was okay. Not really above and beyond. When you are alone at a hotel bar you appreciate a bit of senseless nonsense conversation. This one was a non-talker. The food was amazing!  Pricey for what I ordered and smallish for what should've been a 6 ounce. Also, I realized when my entre was served it was a Chose-your-own-sauce, which my server chose for me instead if asking. The sauce was great but didn't pair well with the wine I had already ordered. It was kinda dead in there at 8pm on Sunday night. Travelers like to interact with one another. The ambiance was there. Nice place, had potential, but just didn't hit the mark. Food wise, I would be interested in going back...well cooked, presented, and composed meal!"}
{"text":"Came here with our family friends for dinner a couple of times.  Sleek, modern take on southwestern cuisine. Very open kitchen with neat seating/tables.

The guacamole is very good, and they make it for you fresh at the table. Good acidity of the lime juice balanced by the buttery, tasty texture of the avocado.  Low on the onions, which is good - I'm not a huge onion fan when it comes to guacamole. The chips are good, but not the best I've ever had.  They do come in a cool cone basket though.

The tortilla soup is also very good. The bring the chicken and tortilla in the bowl, and bring the steaming soup broth in a ceramic jar, pouring it into the bowl to make the soup.  The soup was creamy, spicy (not overly), and quite pleasant.  Big pieces of shredded chicken.

Salads were okay, but not great.

I had the chicken quesadilla, which were two quesadillas (one corn and one flour) filled with jack and oaxacan cheeses and shredded chicken.  Tasty and filling.

The maple glazed salmon is also very good - sweet and well prepared.  The service was friendly, but was not the fastest service, so plan for a longer dinner."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Okay food, nice employees, slow service, so-so experience, wouldn't go back.

After reading the reviews, I was excited to take my boyfriend here on his birthday for the Wine Me, Dine Me dinner. I think $65 per person for a four course meal and alcohol tastings (note: tasting size pours) is a great price. However, neither my bf or I thought the dinner and service was worth it. It was fun to try something different, but blah.

FOOD / SERVICE:

FIRST COURSE: SHRIMP CEVICHE IN MANGO PUREE. Both of us thought the mango puree was overpowering, not a lot of seafood, not that remarkable. The accompanying tequila with a smoked salt was so nice! When we sat down, there was an older couple on our right and a single older male on our left. The couple told us that we could have seabass if we didn't want filet. Chef Jayson introduced himself and started preparing our ceviche appetizers. He put diced jalapeno on top of one, and I asked if we could have the other one without it because my bf is way sensitive to spicy foods. Chef seemed a little offput by the question, but it was too late since he went ahead and put the jalapeno on. We didn't care, I picked some off and my bf ate around it. No biggie. 

SECOND COURSE: SHAVED RAW ASPARAGUS SALAD. My bf isn't big on salads or asparagus, so he asked if he could have a caesar instead. The chef said, \"No, it's a set menu.\" I waited to ask the waitress for a menu so I could order one for the bf (after all, it was his bday and I was more than willing to pay more to get him a salad he likes) but she must've been busy. I eventually asked the hostess for one. When the chef saw I had a menu, he told my bf he could ask for a caesar if he didn't like the asparagus salad. *The salad was interesting and tasted bland. My bf ended up eating all of his (I think due to hunger), and I only had one bite because I didn't care for it. 

The second course is the last time we heard from the chef. He talked at length with the older diners around us, but only stopped by to ask how we wanted our steak cooked, which his sous chef had already asked. The sous chef brought us the salads, poured the remaining wines, and took care of us from then on. We saw the chef leisurely talking with the other kitchen staff. No one looked too busy. ADVICE: If you're late 20s/30s like us, this may not be the place for excellent service unless you stay on the chef's good side.   

THIRD COURSE: FILET MIGNON OR SEABASS. We like to share things and had steak the previous night, so we went with one filet and one fish. Each came topped with guacamole, served with hominy in a cheese sauce. The filet was delicious, but my bf wanted his cooked more. Had to wait quite a while for this since no one checked on us. The seabass was moist, crusted with breadcrumbs. Unfortunately, putting guacamole on top of the entrees didn't add much. It was too heavy for the seabass and the flavor didn't quite blend or enhance the steak. I don't like hominy so I didn't eat any of it and was still hungry.

FOURTH COURSE: SOME MINI CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE OR CAKE-LIKE THING AND A MINI HIBISCUS CREME BRULEE. The desserts were tiny, served with a Washington Riesling. Chocolate cake resembled a two-bite brownie, but was dry. Neither of us finished ours. The creme brulee was about 1.5 inches in diameter. It was delicious though not set--it was runny like a raw egg. Really nice pastry chef--he gave the couple next to us a huge bowl of berries instead of one of their dessert plates. We should've asked for the same! 

Since I was still hungry, I asked the sous chef to taste the garlic mashed potatoes. (Open kitchen so I was eyeballing them all night.) He gave me a bowl full and told me I could have more. YUM! They tasted amazing. I also ordered fry bread from the waitress. She brought me several pieces. I would've finished all of them if I had butter, but couldn't get anyone's attention to ask for it.

* * * * * * * * * * 

WRAP-UP: The restaurant was pretty dead even though it was a Friday and our reservation was at 7:45. The bar and lounge area was more crowded. Most people we interacted with were extremely pleasant and professional. We just didn't see the server too frequently. Waited a long time for things like ordering a martini, getting a martini, and getting and paying the bill. The hostess finally took my credit card and found the waitress.

I really wanted it to be a great dinner for my boyfriend's birthday. Too bad it was pretty disappointing :(  He said he liked the idea and appreciated the attempt! Next time we'll stick to a sure thing, especially for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I ate breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert at SWB while staying at the resort.  The avocado toast I enjoyed for breakfast was delicious-thick toast topped with guacamole and an egg cooked to your preference (over medium was delicious).  For lunch I had the arugula salad and added shrimp, which was OK.  For $8 they added four shrimp :/.  I ended up getting a cup of chicken tortilla soup because I knew the salad would not tide me over until dinner.  I went with a large group for dinner at SWB and we were all pretty underwhelmed.  We did start with the tableside guacamole, which is delicious.  I had the salmon, which was overcooked.  Several folks ordered the baby back ribs, which were flavorless and not even close to fall-off-the-bone.  No one was a fan.  One evening we had drinks on the patio and the waitress told us about the s'mores dessert, so after dinner at a restaurant outside the resort, we returned for dessert.  It was not as she had described-which was melted chocolate in a bowl topped with marshmallow cream and graham crackers on the side-like a dip.  What we received was a bowl of marshmallow cream with chocolate bars and graham crackers on the side.  Meh.  The marshmallow cream wasn't warm enough to melt the chocolate.  I will say service was good and the seating on the patio is very nice.  Waitstaff was always very attentive to making sure we were comfortable outside and adjusting the heaters accordingly.  SWB is OK, but there are better places to eat in Scottsdale that are less expensive."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Healthy GF and vegi options. Great ambiance, especially in the month of October - perfect temp to dine alfresco."}
{"text":"Most people who dine in a resort are looking for convenience. Taste, that's the reason to go to SWB.

Third visit
You'd think that after eating at a place three times you'd find something that wasn't quite as good, but not here. Everything on the menu is great.

Menu items to try
Try the house made salmon burger with jalapeño tartar sauce.
Or the oven roasted turkey melt with manchego cheese, apples and Jicama. They also smear cranberry-green chili spread on the bread. Super Yum!

You can even get orders to go if you want to eat in your room, or by an outdoor fireplace."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to SWB yesterday thanks to a gift certificate we purchase on Restaurant.com.  SWB is in the Hyatt Hotel at Gainey Ranch. The hotel is beautiful and the restaurant is right off of a lounge on the lower level. It has an open feel to it but because it to open to the lounge area it was a little noisy at times. It wasn't a problem at all for me but if you want a quite dinner it could be disturbing.

The food was excellent. I had a filet mignon which was prepared exactly as I requested and my wife had a different steak that she also liked. The food has a Southwest flare and some can be spicy. We split a salad which was plenty for us and we got a bottle of wine. 

Service was good but not excellent (for a restaurant in this price range). We did have to ask to have our water refilled at least twice. Desert was incredible but we were so stuffed we could not eat it all.

So overall the food was excellent, the service was good, and the atmosphere was good. It almost deserves fives stars but because the price range is so high I am rating it compared to other high end restaurants. We spent $136, plus the $100 restaurant.com gift certificate so for a $236 dinner I like to see ever detail excellent before I can give something five stars.

If you like the menu of Southwestern food, this is worth a try. The food was 5 stars in every aspect."}
{"text":"Got the SWB burger ($17) and the honey lavender ice cream ($6) here when I visited Arizona. I thought the ice cream was the best and most unique flavor I've ever had but the burger was a tad bit pricey for its taste. I'd say it wasn't the best burger I've ever had but it was pretty decent. I liked that it came with either fries, soup or salad. I was mistaken and thought it came with fries AND soup OR salad but I was greatly mistaken. I ended up ordering a side of fries for $5. Overall I wasn't too impressed or amazed the food but it was fairly decent."}
{"text":"Not sure where to start, I was seated and then waited for 10 minutes before the hostess noted that I nobody had been to my table.  She told me she would get my water and coffee, she came back with the water.  I decided to go for the breakfast buffet and the food was not good - the potatoes were raw and although it was busy, it looked like everything had sat a long time (I assumed that the staff was not bringing freshly made items to the buffet but rather items sitting in a warmer).

I finally saw a waitress half way through my meal and again asked for coffee.  I never did see the coffee and juice I asked for came after I finished my meal.

Mediocre food, poor service and resort prices, I won't make that mistake again."}
{"text":"We returned our car to the Hertz counter and popped in here for a quick bite. I didn't stay at this hotel but from what I saw  - it' quite a beautiful property. 
SWB is Scottsdale casual. The waiter was cool but painfully slow. When the place is almost empty at 6PM there is no excuse for a waiter not being more accessible to his customers. 
The chips and salsa trio was small but tasty, no complaints for eight bucks. The pistachio crusted new-york strip was tasty. Not a big portion but for $34 no complaints. 
Not bad meal but I wouldn't go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast with consistent 5 star service. I have had breakfast all over Scottsdale in traveling for work and the Steel cut oats here are awesome! Plus, they give you both walnuts and pecans, plus strawberries!

Great job!"}
{"text":"Beautiful Christmas lunch. The hostesses were not pleasant bit the waiters and servers for the brunch were excellent! ! So helpful and quick. The valet people were great too!  We ate indoors which was nice but the tables were too close to each other. Food was tasty! They had a nice variety, traditional turkey dinner, sushi, pasta, seafood, and a fantastic dessert bar!"}
{"text":"I recently did the wine me and dine me option at SWB and had a great experience. Chef Juan was very kind and informative and food and wine/ tequila pairing were great! He took the time to answer all our questions and over all it was an awesome date experience! It's quite pricey but worth it for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Well, we keep trying the Hyatt Gainey Ranch....

Had high hopes for SWB....

Location: Great
Prices: High
Food: Medium
Service: Low

If your captive at the Hyatt, probably an OK lunch place, but Scottsdale has so much better to offer. We are just sad to see how far down this Hyatt continues to slide."}
{"text":"Half Chicken was delicious.  Scallops were tough.  Food was some what bland for the prices that you are paying.  Medium table side made Guacamole was mild but had good flavor.  The chips were disappointed and tasted like they came from a bag.  The chicken quesadilla looked like tacos.  Overall the food was just ok.  Not what I was expecting.  Drinks were all about $12+."}
{"text":"I like this place.  My wife and I spent a couple of nights at the Hyatt Regency Scottsdale where this eatery is located.  After a short wait in the cavernous adjacent lounge we were seated outside next to a blazing fire pit which was very comfortable and inviting.  As we often do, we opted to order a few appetizers in lieu of entrees to share.  We were not disappointed.  We sampled their southwestern crab cakes, grits, a ceasar salad and fresh ceviche which is basically Mexican sushi.  I don't typically order fresh fish this far from a coast but I took a chance and I'm glad I did.  Everything was really tasty with good texture and presentation.  The southwestern grits actually arrived by mistake in lieu of the cornbread we ordered which we got to keep anyway.  I wasn't sure what to expect but they were actually very good - cooked with fresh cilantro and some other seasons.

The service was attentive.  The atmosphere was romantically delightful.  When coupled with the excellent fare it was a very pleasant dining experience albeit a bit pricey.  If you order appetizers like we did you'll save a little money and have more food than you can finish.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Very good service. Friendly staff. In an incredible resort. The food prep is very good. Upscale South Western Flair.  Tableside guacamole really is a must!  The tacos were great and the burgers cooked to perfection.  It was nice that they would amend some of the menu items to your satisfaction."}
{"text":"Good place for a drink as the views are nice and there is always something going at the hotel.  I thought the food was a little subpar for the price.  I like that they make the guacamole right in front of you.  The entire place is wide open so it can get pretty noisy (we did not mind) Definitely enough space for children."}
{"text":"Came to SWB for dinner while my husband was at a conference.  I don't usually have high expectations for restaurants in hotels.  The service was really attentive and nice but they seemed less experienced. The food was good and better than I expected. 

I ordered:
Carne Asada Quesadilla
I was just going to order the quesadilla for dinner and good thing I didn't. It was more like 2 tacos. Very flavorful though...

Santa Fe Caesar Salad
I'm not much of a salad person,  but thought I should have something healthier after my In and Out lunch.  Loved the cornbread croutons and roasted corn."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Table for 5 was too small. Sitting outside was nice. Chips and guacamole cost so much for such a small serving. The dips were very good but you needed more than one serving of chips to finish the dips. I ordered the fajitas. They were very good. Perfect serving size. Some might even say too much. Staff was friendly, didn't give us a hard time. Overall not worth it. Go somewhere else, the options are limited."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here after spending a night at the Hyatt.  Two dishes we shared were really good. I like Gruyere cheese, any dish cooked with that cheese is always good for me. A little salty but it was good.

Pancake was very good. I really like the texture of the pancake. I don't know what they mixed, it was a bit chewy in a good way. Very fluffy and soft yet when you bite, it sort of bounce back. I can't describe well enough of this texture, it was similar to Japanese mochi but much less chewy than that.  I almost thought they added a little corn starch to pancake mix. 

Coffee was just okay.  I wish they used better quality of coffee to complete my meal.

I really enjoyed outdoor seating. Not too hot, not too cold, perfect weather. Great view of the hotel and golf course. It was very nice resort.

It was very relaxing breakfast."}
{"text":"They have no idea what color a medium steak should look like. My mother in law sent a filet back twice. Asked twice for bread. Had water refilled twice but not during the meal. Asked for it specially. Luckily the waiter Ryan discounted the bill 75%. That's the only reason it gets 3 stars.  And please leave screaming tired children with a babysitter. My parents and grandparents did not tolerate running through restaurants or screaming at the table."}
{"text":"I had the fajitas. It was ok but nothing special. I def think that all the food was lacking flavor.. The service was ok but the def need to work on it! 

My husband had the steak sandwich he really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"For Mother's Day brunch it's a hit at my house and has been for two years running.

The good measure of any breakfast brunch is the Eggs Bene, it's a tough dish to get right and even harder when they have to sit out.  At this buffet they don't sit for long.  The eggs are cooked great and they take away the old ones if they have been there  long.  

The rest of the selection is great with everything you would expect: crab legs, sushi, salmon, pasta, carving stations, omelette station, and desserts galore.  Champagne of course.

The service is great, the ambiance is relaxing, and the outdoor patio is great in the spring.  

See you there next Mother's day!"}
{"text":"We stayed at the hotel here so we came down to eat some breakfast.  Buffet is $18 per person so it's a deal compared to ordering a la carte.  Indoor and outdoor seating available.  Our server was very friendly and personable.  Plenty of food choices including scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, pancakes (even ones with chocolate chip), cereal, fresh fruits, toast, pastries, and croissants.  All the hot items were fresh and hot.  It didn't seem like food has been sitting there for hours like most buffets.  My only wish list was for better tasting coffee and to have yogurt."}
{"text":"Take my review with a grain of salt since I came here for lunch on a Monday.

First the good: the ambiance is nice. It's got a great open patio with waterfalls and shade. The service is also acceptably attentive. They slipped a little with the water refills, but nothing egregious.

Then the meh: the tortilla soup. Is this really worth all the raves? I think not. It's very typical, non-inventive, tortilla soup. By the other reviews, I was expecting to be blown away. Didn't happen. The soup is fine with chunks of chicken and vegetables, but the base is too creamy and far too bland to compete with the big guns in tortilla soup. The house salad was also in the meh. It's a mild pet peeve of mine to overdress a salad. It happened. I should've gotten it on the side. My fault. The roasted cherry tomatoes were yum though, and saved it all."}
{"text":"Did the \"wine me dine me\" experience. It was fun and lots of food and drinks. Food was good. Sat at the counter and engaged with the chef and his kitchen staff. We had great customer service! Would recommend as something different to do for a dinner experience with a group of people. At end of meal we got vouchers to do the gondola ride on the water at the hotel. Our gondola person sang opera during the ride. Fun and lots of laughs!"}
{"text":"Located in the lobby of the hotel (Hyatt Scottsdale Gainey Ranch), I didn't necessarily expect a lot out of the experience. My business travels sometimes mean eating hotel meals for as much as ten days in a row, so I've lowered my expectations. But hey - pretty okay! First, it was a cold day and I got my pick of seating, so I grabbed a seat by the fireplace. Ambiance and all that. I was reading a book on my Kindle, just chilling like a lonely travelers. We won't pretend the prices were cheap - it's a hotel - but I was jazzed by some interesting tastes. My favorite was the jalapeño cornbread. I'm a wimp for hot stuff, but this came out in the cast iron dish and I was in heaven. 

Pleasant staff, quick service and they wrapped my leftovers up for me with utensils (joke's on them, that totally got left in my hotel fridge because I forgot about it). Don't get me wrong - if someone's willing to take you out to eat around here, go, because there's a lot of good stuff around. But if you're just trying to relax a little maybe after a day of flying, this is a pretty good option"}
{"text":"We arrived at a very slow time of the day (saw 2 other tables occupied) and received a greeting very quickly. After sitting at a table outside, we received quick attention...but this was the last time. Make sure you are not in a hurry!  Order took long. Check took FOREVER. Drinks took long. 
We ordered the guacamole table side spicy and found the guacamole bland. Lacked salt , brightness,  and spice.  Disappointing. We followed the guacamole with a Caesar salad for her and the chicken club for me (as recommended by our waiter). The salad was nothing special....eh. The chicken club was bland and extremely dry (over cooked).  The chef needs to learn basic seasoning! 
If you are looking for nothing special, this will be the place for you. The prices are over priced even for a resort."}
{"text":"A colleague and I dropped in for lunch.  Located inside the Hyatt Gainey Ranch Hotel, this bistro is kind of a cool spot for business lunches.  After browsing the menu, I asked the server for her recommendations.  She mentioned the Tortilla Soup and the Chicken Sandwich...I decided to order both!

Chicken Tortilla Soup, $7
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/swb-southwest-bistro-scottsdale?select=ierF1dcLqbHnkuSYQVBfEQ#ierF1dcLqbHnkuSYQVBfEQ

Chicken Sandwich, $13.50
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/swb-southwest-bistro-scottsdale?select=jP3kNNLapF2saR16v6cu4g#jP3kNNLapF2saR16v6cu4g

The Tortilla Soup came out first.  I ordered a small size since they didn't have cups and it was a nice sized portion.  It's not as thick as I normally like my Tortilla Soup, but what it lacked in texture, it made up in flavor...this is a good soup!

A short time later, the Chicken Sandwich came out.  This portion size is not too large, it's actually perfect for lunch.  I took one bite out of it and instantly became a fan.  The Bread is a sourdough sandwich roll and went perfectly with the grilled flavor of the Chicken.  The Fries were seasoned with Sea Salt...that makes a huge difference.  I prefer Sea Salt seasoned Fries over regular salted Fries.

Our server and the rest of the staff was very friendly.  The resort atmosphere was very relaxing.  It's a great spot for lunch if you're in the area.

{"text":"Since it's winter here in AZ it was great sitting outside by their fire pit.  The desert I had was really good! It was a carmel tart."}
{"text":"SWB was definitely the highlight of my visit to the Hyatt. On our second day we visited and had brunch and it was magnificent. The servers were attentive, professional and overwhelmingly friendly and polite. The spread was exceptional with choices for every person's palate. And the price, compared to everything else at the resort, was somewhat reasonable. If you visit, I recommend the bottomless mimosa. My wife had four. It was quite a treat. 

Not to mention, the location is stunning. As most of the resort is beautiful, SWB is too, and we were seated just off on the main patio under a canopy and next to a large fire pit. The whole experience was serene as well as surreal. 

While my feelings on the resort itself have been detailed in another review, I would certainly make time to revisit SWB if I ever find myself in Scottsdale again, just for the amazing brunch experience."}
{"text":"What a treat!
The food and service at SWB is first rate.
On a recent Monday night our party of five had a great dinner.

The tortilla soup and guacamole were prepared at our table - unique flavors & tasty.
Our waitress had described the ribs as one her favorites - a special chili sauce,  meat being cooked all day with the pork that falls right off the bone. I'm glad two of us listened to her. They were outstanding. Something I would order again.

I'm one to ask a lot of questions and trust the opinion of the wait staff. I found both our bus girl and waitress to give natural, pleasant and descriptive answers that took me down the right path.
I wrapped up dinner with a refreshing bowl of blood orange sorbet.

SWB has a casual atmosphere with an airy appeal. 
Located in the Hyatt at Gainey Ranch, this does not come off as your typical hotel dining spot.

This gets a high recommendation from me, whether your a guest at the hotel or not."}
{"text":"We got take out here on our last night at the hotel and were very pleased with the fajita and some of the happy hour items. Everything was good and solid."}
{"text":"Three friends and I dined at SWB, a Southwest Bistro, on Saturday evening.  We feel so fortunate to live in the Phoenix metro area and have the opportunity to enjoy the resort experience of the Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort and the fine cuisine that SWB offers.  I've enjoyed the ambiance and cuisine of the Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort since it opened around 1987.  With its grand entry overlooking a beautiful view, it's a wonderful way to share the beauty of Arizona with out-of-town visitors.    

I had the salmon, which was served just the way I ordered it and presented beautifully.  It was cooked perfectly and was flaky and moist. Two of my friends had the rack o f lamb, which they said had been seasoned to complement the lamb well.  My fourth friend had the Atlantic halibut, which he enjoyed as well.  We ordered the Pascual Toso Malbec, which was excellent.  We were pleasantly surprised when Damon Thompson, the Beverage Manager at the Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort, shared with us a special bottle of wine.  It was Red Schooner by Caymus Voyage 4,, which had a nice fruity flavor and velvety texture and paired well with our fish and lamb. Our server, Max, was very attentive, knowledgeable and pleasant.  After dinner we enjoyed listening to the live band playing in the lively Center Stage Bar."}
{"text":"Expensive for the food quality.. most bland tasting guacamole ever(they need serrano peppers)....the caesar salad tasted like it was drowned in mayonnaise dressing(the chicken on top was actually very good). We had a team of two servers- one was great- the other one couldn't have cared less. A manager never stopped by our table nor did we ever see one. I would NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch is just OK but wildly disappointing for $50++. The price should be no more than $30. 

As a lot of others have said, many of the hot items had obviously been sitting out for too long under the heat lamps. Service was also just OK. Bloody Marys  are a COMPLETE RIPOFF at $13++. 18% gratuity added on parties of 6 or more - INCLUDING young toddlers. No itemized receipt brought with CC receipt - a big no-no. 

The bacon was good.  The only potatoes were mashed.  Would be nice to have breakfast potatoes etc.

They claim their ovens are wood ovens but from what I could see they were gas. At least mostly gas-assisted which is not the same as wood ovens.

Be aware that you may be seated next to large groups with young kids who feel the need to run around making a lot of noise.

Overall - mediocre. Soooo many better places for a nice brunch in town at better prices with better service, food and ambiance."}
{"text":"Staying at the Hyatt and decided to checkout this place for a late night dinner. I come from Kansas home to the best steaks in the world so of course I was a little disappointed by the KC Strip. It was a poor grade of meat with little to no seasoning. I would recommend this place if you're extremely hungry from a long flight and don't care for amazing flavor."}
{"text":"Had the shrimp fajitas  . Horrible.  $17 for literally 2 small shrimps cut in 2 pieces.  Not worth the $17."}
{"text":"High quality food in a nice outdoor setting. Lunch outside on a winter day (65 degrees) was refreshing."}
{"text":"Not really into Southwest cuisine, so why did we end up here? Probably because we saw the Super De-Tox Juice (Turmeric, Cucumber, Lime, Green Apple, Beets, Spinach) on the glass menu outside, it truly was the best looking and best tasting juice I've had in a long time. 

I didn't have much appetite so just nibbled on hubby's Omelette (we liked the little jars of jams on our toast) and the sun was shining every which way due to the large windows. Not a place for me to sit and read the paper.

Later we discovered almost all restaurants on site offer that Super De-Tox Juice...."}
{"text":"Food was good, service great and nice atmosphere but I \"don't do birds\".  Not fun fighting those pests for my food.  Birds carry disease and I won't be back for that reason.  Too bad as its a nice place."}
{"text":"Awesome Saturday breakfast buffet (until 11am). I wanted a resort style brunch setting to treat my folks too while they were in town. The service here is impeccable as are the grounds, which deserve a good walking through after you gorge yourself on heaps of fresh fruit, pastries, bacon and eggs. Located in central Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I tried SWB twice - here's what I found:

I was greeted by a pleasant host upon my arrival for both visits and promptly seated.

I had the rosemary jalapeno french fries with a decent cheese burger for lunch, then tried SWB again and had better-than-average beef fajitas with lots of peppers.

Note to self: the service can be spotty, so speak up if you're being neglected during a slow time of the day.

They have a fireplace by one of the tables, an open-air kitchen that's fun to watch, and the table-side guacamole looks good even if it is a bit expensive. 

I think the most rewarding aspect of SWB is that you can get Sushi from Noh brought over to your table if you're polite and ask your server.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary dinner, as my husband proposed to me here 2 years ago. We had bacon wrapped shrimp, rack of lamb, and chips and guacamole. I was a little disappointed that we only got 3 shrimp for $16. Other than that, food was delicious and the service was great. They even brought out creme brûlée on the house for our anniversary, which was a nice touch and DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"My wife and I celebrated our seventh wedding anniversary with the SWB's \"Wine Me, Dine Me\" experience, and we were thrilled with the service, quality of the food dishes, and the inter-activeness with the staff. 

Chef Juan and Pasty Chef Jessica particularly went above-and-beyond to make us feel welcome and to have a most memorable evening.  Chef Juan was warm and candid with us as we interacted through the evening.  Chef Jessica spent some time early in the evening getting to know us before selecting the perfect desert treat for us. 

This was our first time to participate in the \"Wine Me, Dine Me\" experience, and it was very neat to sit at the kitchen bar overlooking the chefs' work-stations and to be able to talk to them as they prepared our meals and the meals for others in the dining area.  I especially enjoyed the presentation and explanation of each dish; was interesting to hear their concept and thought beyond each dish.

As noted by others below, the service-level was beyond our expectations, and we especially appreciated the one-on-one interactions with Chef Juan and Chef Jessica.  The four-course meal was perfect, and we really liked the food pairings with top-notch tequila and a few local Arizona wines.  Afterwards, we enjoyed an awesome gondola ride and were treated to a few wonderful songs from Marcus the Gondolier.  Before calling it an evening, we sat in the lounge area and listened to a wonderful singing, guitar player (already forgot his name, though).    

Overall, we had a wonderful evening, and I give this dining experience 5-stars!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite restaurant when visiting Scottsdale.  Sure, it's in a hotel, but that's no reason to knock it.  We stayed in the hotel where this restaurant is located so we had dinner here one night and breakfast every day.

Everything about this place is great.  The ambiance is wonderful (when sitting outside).  It's quiet and casual but still has a very nice feel to it.  

The food was SO GOOD.  For dinner, we had tacos as an appetizer.  I had a Southwest salad and mac & cheese.  My husband had a mushroom tamale.  Everything was fantastic.

For breakfast, we either had the buffet or the banana pancakes (which I ordered twice).  I'm hungry just thinking about them!

The service was good, too.  Very friendly and made us feel welcome.

I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place was in the hotel.  I expected typical hotel food and was pleasantly surprised to have a nice meal.  We had lunch here and also a breakfast.  The staff was very attentive (even though we were the only people outside) and friendly.

I loved this place."}
{"text":"Great crab and avocado salad. Gluten free and generous amounts of lump crab."}
{"text":"This is a horrible restaurant. I stayed at this Hyatt for the weekend so my boyfriend could golf and we came here to eat one night. We waited an extremely long time for everything. There seemed to be enough staff, but they just weren't attentive at all. We had an appetizer, the guacamole and chips, which I did like the fact that they made the guacamole in front of us at the table, but it was tasteless. After we had the appetizer, we ordered and our food came an hour later. My boyfriend ordered a prime rib for about $35 and a tiny steak sandwich came instead. We got up and left. After waiting an hour for our food and not getting what we ordered, we headed back to the room and ordered room service. It was pretty disappointing. There seemed to be a common theme at this entire resort actually, bad service. Everything at this place was beautiful, but because of the service, I never want to go back again."}
{"text":"This is for the Wine me, Dine me.
It was not very impressive. Our \"wine steward\" for the evening admitted he didn't even drink wine himself but thought we ladies would like the sweeter wine the best. WHAT?!?! Not only were you stupid, you were insulting too. Maybe the restaurant should have a professional serving wine instead of college kid.

The Chef was very nice and the first three course were good but again, not impressed. The dessert was the most disappointing, we should have asked for something different. Even the chef implied at the beginning of the evening that the pastry's chef creation was a crap shoot....total fail! I should have said something at the time but only went back later to tell the chef who had left for the evening. I would stick to the regular menu. Breakfast each morning was great so I can only imagine their other menus are good too."}
