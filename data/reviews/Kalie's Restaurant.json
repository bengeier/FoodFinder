{"text":"I started coming here with Hubby after several neighbors recommended it. I'm giving it five stars because it's just what a neighborhood breakfast/lunch diner should be. Good food, reasonable prices, clean and friendly. 

I don't eat meat - get the veggie omelet every time. Hubs has eaten his way through the menu. We are both happy. 

The food is tasty and portions are big. I like that they have grits on their menu. The servers are beyond friendly and efficient. They have a lot of regulars and greet people like they are family. 

This has become a go-to breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Have gone here a couple times with my dad for breakfast. We usually go first thing in the morning before work, right as they open, so there's never more than a couple customers there. The food is standard greasy-spoon diner fare, and it is pretty tasty. Prices are fair, and portions are good. Definitely has that old-school diner feel. Service is prompt and polite. Will go back again and would recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is not all that bad.  It's a greasy spoon, family-owned, breakfast restaurant.  This place is nothing to write home about, just your standard neighborhood breakfast place.  It's a little on the dirty side, but the staff is very friendly.  I had eggs and toast and it was fine."}
{"text":"Unassuming diner on Mayfield avenue.  I've driven by it a gazillion times and never knew it was here. Some better signage might get some more customers through the door. Very basic economy diner that serves breakfast, burgers, sandwiches, salads, and that's about it. It's open 7-2 Monday to Sunday.  Not a high volume place. Only one waitress working. Lunches are about 10 bucks out the door. They were out of soup and burgers when I stopped in so they aren't always expecting a big crowd. Clean even if a bit rundown. Parking in the back. Service was good and somewhat abrupt.  Lunch was so-so. I wouldn't call it cozy. Just a veey basic place to eat. Nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"The sign says 'seat yourself' but really the sever has to find you a seat. The prices are a high for breakfast for the portion size. Everything is extra. There's one TV it's small. I probably wouldn't return. The quest continues for a good breakfast diner in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Only OK on the food... Many little mistakes on dish. Crazy charges for extras. Not very clean and overpriced for offering."}
{"text":"Not to impressed. Lousy ambience.
Extra charges for hash browns.
I'll continue  my business @ joes."}
{"text":"Great little local greasy spoon! Cheap prices, good food, and GIANT I mean GIANT pancakes! Friendly servers and the the couple that own it are super nice. Usually not a fan of diner coffee, but there's is pretty decent. Nice selection of sodas and juices. Wish they were open later than 2p every day!"}
{"text":"The good:

Low prices. Fast and friendly service, even on a crowded Sunday late morning. Seems well-run. Clearly popular--I've been a few times, and there are always a lot of people.


The bad:

Fairly small menu. (I think they are only open for breakfast and lunch, and their breakfast menu is surprisingly short.) Not much atmosphere. Pancakes are fluffy and good, but way too big to eat (one is a meal, but two is the smallest order) and served with plain non-maple syrup that isn't nearly as good as the pancakes deserve. Scrambled eggs came mixed with globs of brown meat grease (or something like that)--very unappetizing.

The meat-eaters in my party agreed with me: it's OK, but not good enough to draw us back again. If my friends wanted to go there, I wouldn't refuse. TIP: there is parking in back off of Green."}
