{"text":"Coyote is a great local spot to grab a delicious brew in a very relaxed atmosphere that makes you want to stay a while. Staff is extremely welcoming and even had a highchair available for my son which was a delightful surprise. So far I've enjoyed their toddy and the flavour of the coffee is superb to say the least. My husband had the blended caramel charger and it was to die for!!! If they have the jalapeño bagel available I strongly recommend it, delicious :)"}
{"text":"Great place, little small but good stuff. Wish they where open on Sunday :-)"}
{"text":"The coffee here is amazing! The cafe is so clean and the staff is very friendly. Excellent customer service here! I wish I had found this place sooner."}
{"text":"This place is great. Have been there three times and everything has been amazing. 
The gentleman that made my coffee is exceptional. Not only did he know what he was doing but was very precise and meticulous in the way he prepared my americano. It showed that he cared about how 'he' made it, not just how I wanted it. I love it when someone takes pride in their work.
They also have a cozy seating area where one can hang out or study. I'll be coming here more often."}
{"text":"Coyote coffee is everything you could want in a coffee shop..quiet, quaint, nicely and comfortably furnished with delicious coffee and great staff. Every time I've gone, the coffee is perfect.  The staff I've been served by have all been friendly, knowledgeable, and quick. There's no confusing sizes in words you're embarrassed to say, no crazy specialty drinks..just delicious coffeehouse drinks and sweets. They have a punch card program towards free drinks and a \"pay it forward\" board, where you can buy a friend, employee, or stranger a drink. They also sell and service espresso machines, if youre so inclined..the equipment part of the shop reminds me of a fine cigar shop..i also appreciate that when I've gone in to look at the equipment, no one hovered or scolded me for playing around with it...which i did delicately..as most machines start at $200...
Coyote coffee is at the end of a strip mall that has Munch-a-mania, a police supply shop and some other stores..it has big banners that you can't miss.. and you shouldn't. ..this local business deserves our business."}
{"text":"This is an amazing coffee shop and by far the best coffee I've had. I often go into small local shops (and I love my starbucks) and try coffee and this place has amazing coffee! It tastes great, the price is extremely reasonable and the staff is beyond friendly. I highly recommend this coffee shop to anyone visiting or local."}
{"text":"Okay...I might be a little biased since our daughter works here and took care of us today. 

My hot chai latte was delicious and Sue said her hot chocolate was \"the best ever.\"  

They have a great selection, a comfortable and clean sitting area, wifi and some outdoor seating. 
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is in an industrial place. Not really my cup of tea so to speak but others may like it. Unfortunately the coffee was un-drinkable. McDonald's was better. I will maybe give them another try as my office is close because I don't know how it could be that bad."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee, great study atmosphere but the hours aren't the best since they close by 2pm on Saturday. I want to spend all day studying here! Blended hazelnut is amazing and my go-to."}
{"text":"It is right opposite to Tesla showroom. Good place to work and their Cranberry Lemon Muffin is bomb.com"}
{"text":"Love this place. Here visiting from out of town and so glad we stopped in here. The service is great, the coffee is great, the atmosphere is awesome and very comfy seating. Also, great tunes :) 
Will definitely come back the next time we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The best part of this place is the staff. Coffee is just so so!  It will do when you are in a pinch but not my favorite. Obviously to each their own."}
{"text":"They close at 4pm now, so I can't get my occasional coffee for my ride home... but other than that I always liked getting a drink for the ride. Staff always seemed pretty friendly to me as well."}
{"text":"Had a delicious chai latte here! The barista was really nice and gave me a punch card and a sticker. 

There aren't a ton of places to sit, but I was there in the middle of the day so I didn't have a problem finding a comfy seat. Would definitely return if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I have a very expensive \"home\" coffee maker, which went South. Other than sending it to the manufacturer, there was no one who locally fixes it. Voila!!  I found Curtis at the Coyote Coffee Company. He had to replace EVERYTHING, but he kept me updated on the progress. His wife Josephine is also a delight. It's a family owned business with high ethics, and extremely nice people."}
{"text":"The staff were very nice and personable. I'm not too familiar with coffee, but they helped me choose the right drink for me, and it was delicious. I definitely wouldn't mind becoming a regular here!"}
{"text":"not a bad place, nice service and quiet place to sit and read or work. if you like local coffee shops with a trendy atmosphere- this isn't really the place. The cold brew was good, typical price. only reason gave it 3 stars because of the atmosphere... odd music choice and felt awkward. if you're just stopping in to grab a drink, definitely try it out and support the local guys!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp while I was waiting for my truck to get out of the shop. They have great house black coffee and offer a student discount which is always a plus. Indoor seating has nice, clean and comfortable chairs and couches. Nice covered seating outside as well. I didn't have any, but the pastries looked great."}
{"text":"Found this little coffee shop via Groupon. Lucky for me it's right by my house. I'm not a coffee drinker but I am a Chia Latte addict and their chai is really good! It has a nice spice to it which makes for a refreshing drink hot or cold. I also love their lemon muffins. I brought my computer and stayed to hang out and they warmed the muffin up for me..amazing! It's just a super chill coffee shop with reasonable prices that offers TV, free wifi, a couch or tables to bring a book or laptop and outdoor seating. The staff was super friendly and helpful and I will be back."}
{"text":"Pros: The coffee here is great, no question about that. The service people are amazingly friendly. This place is a great place to go for homework when Cartel or Royal are waaaay too busy. The atmosphere, again friendly, is not loud, and the music is not disagreeable (mainly classic rock/pop). Their coffee machines are top of the line, I assume this is because they also sell coffee equipment here, so they have access to the best of their stock. Their Wi-Fi is dependable. Coffee prices are phenomenal, and I haven't had a bad cup of coffee here (plus, they have A LOT of choices)

Cons: There are enough plugs for laptops, but they're in weird locations which require those sitting in tables to manuever around other patrons. The decor has a suburb feel (this can be a pro or a con depending on the clientele - not exactly modern or contemporary): It has a mid-2000s, California-Tuscan feel reminiscent of suburb coffee shops (personally I enjoy this, because the contemporary fluff of many coffee shops these days tend to be too distracting--but others may disagree). Location can be a bit of a problem, but it's out of the way nature is pleasant and helps keep it quiet. Tables aren't large enough for group study sessions (but I rarely do that as a student). My main disagreement is that it closes too early, but that's understandable as to why they would close at 6pm.

My hopes: That they expand and market to more students who live in the apartment complexes near by.

I come here anytime I need to study for an exam, as I am not bothered by loud noises AND I get a great cup of coffee.

All in all, I recommend this place to others as a place that doesn't require the high fees of parking for the library, access to good internet and coffee, and a great staff. Keep it up, and I hope this business keeps on doing well."}
{"text":"Nice coffee place. WiFi with cozy couches. Has a large selection of expresso machines for purchase."}
{"text":"Great latte! Nice customer service & convenient location with easy access & plenty of parking & free WiFi!"}
{"text":"what a terrible coffee shop! what a stupid concept, a coffee shop that opens after everyone is at work. Employees are crazy slow-twenty minutes for two drinks. café? lol $5 bagel & $5 smoothie, place is a joke"}
{"text":"Good cold brew (they call it a 'toddy').  Fast Wifi. Comfortable space. Small but not too busy to get work done.  

I would get a lot more done if it wasn't for this Oldies music...bleh. Change it up (Pandora, a custom mix, ...) and you will get more of my business."}
{"text":"The coffee is amazing!! Pastry stale though :( Rudy was extremely friendly and helpful with making a great drink selection. He also gave me a beat Coyote coffee sticker (Yay!! Can stick on my laptop) and he gave me a punchcard to start filling out without me saying a word. Will be back :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Friendly staff. Great coffee. Great vibe, it's not one of those huge corporate coffee places."}
{"text":"Ok I admit it, I've driven out of my way to buy my coffee and teas here.  Why?  The service and the product.  They are awesome!"}
{"text":"What happened to my coffee??? It is a very nice place but my coffee was not good at all!! I was so disappointed. I am not giving up though, i am going to give it one more try. I will update my review then."}
{"text":"I love coffee.  Being a crazy busy person, I think, dream and run on coffee daily so this review should give you a good idea of how great of a place this is.

Saturday my friend and I stopped in for a pick me up before we went shopping.  I was so amazed when I walked through the door.  I was NOT expecting it to be as nice and inviting when I walked in.  Directly off to the left is a showroom of beautiful espresso machines and to the right is a small little sitting area well equip with comfy couches and chairs and a TV.  

We were greeted with a smile and ordered promptly; a latte and three small cheesecake bites. The owner made our drink and chatted with us while making our drink.  First off, it is SO refreshing to have someone that actually wants to talk to you behind the coffee bar instead of just getting you a drink and pushing you out the door.  In this day and age, that is pretty much extinct.  The owner was happy to tell us all about his shop and about the coffee he clearly has a passion for.  The Ren and Stimpy tip cups are adorable too.  The coffee was very smooth, there was no bitter bite.  This is something that is quite important to me.  (I hate putting sugar in coffee, I feel like this is a violation to the actual flavor of coffee.) The cheesecake bites were delicious.  I also picked up a gold foiled bag of espresso beans to take home for my personal coffee maker.  I am happy to report that these beans were also smooth and had a rich taste.   

I would give this place ten stars if I could.  The owner is very friendly.  The environment is very inviting and welcoming and the coffee and treats are on point.  I am SO glad we stopped in."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Barbara made the best coffee. The price is reasonable. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Always like coming here. Inside is very clean, very comfy.... Staff is always nice. Iced/hot Americano is my forte.... I can really taste the quality espresso."}
{"text":"Good coffee, nice people, and really nice espresso machines for sale that I can't afford but like to look at."}
{"text":"Good coffee in a chill atmosphere. This was a great stop on our way to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Love this place. We owned a coffee house years ago and they serviced our equipment. They truly know how to prepare a great cappuccino! I was so happy to see that they were still
In Tempe. Oh and, I had my 3 dogs with me and was welcome here."}
{"text":"They have really good coffee here. My son picked it up and brought it home for me, so I have never been in to the actual store I have wanted it two more times since he brought it home to me, but both times must have been on a Sunday because they were closed. 

Open Sunday too please."}
{"text":"Decided to stop here instead of Starbucks and it was a great decision! The barista was friendly and knowledgeable. Gave us samples, talked about how they brew and where they get their food items. I wish we had been able to go look at the old machines in the other room. The coffee and service were both smooth and enjoyable! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Meant to leave this review a while ago. Coffee is really great. But have this place a 3 because there has been many times I have came to get coffee way before closing time and they have been closed. It's great coffee, just wish I could have it more."}
{"text":"What a cool little spot for coffee. Seating is limited inside but part of the space here contains a portion off to the side solely devoted to coffee making supplies and machines which I thought was cool. They even have an coffee tamper for sale which has a pressure sensor on it.

The menu has all your standard coffee drinks, as well as smoothies. There are a plethora of milk and milk alternatives, and they also offer sugar free syrups (Vanilla, caramel and hazelnut). I went with a sugar free vanilla latte with almond milk. I appreciate that they ask you what type of roast coffee you would like, I actually have never been asked this at any other coffee shop (Light, medium, dark). I had the medium roast. 

The latte was served in a paper cup, and had a smooth balanced flavor with the almond milk and espresso. There was just the right amount of syrup in it, and I'd venture to say I probably wouldn't need the extra sweetness due to the quality of the coffee and preparation. I did need a bit of time for the latte to cool down a bit as I got a bit overeager and burned my tongue on the first sip of super hot coffee. 

Service was quick and friendly. 

I'm intrigued by their other roasts so I'll be back to try their light and dark roasts."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the nicest customer service I've received compared to other major coffee businesses, they have free WiFi and the coffee is amazing!! Parking was really easy to find, This is gonna be a daily coffee spot for me!"}
{"text":"By far the best coffee around. I don't go all out fancy with mine, I just like a nice plain ol' coffee that tastes good without a bunch of stuff in it...theirs does it! Staff is always friendly without overdoing it. I can walk in and not have to wait in a line a mile long while the staff is chatting it up with the customers about their makeup *grr*. Atmosphere is nice and inviting as well."}
{"text":"Girl behind counter recommended their white ambrosia and green tea to be mixed. It turned out amazing!! The white ambrosia has a fresh coconut taste to it. So good."}
{"text":"This place is ok for a quick drink to go, but it's not a great place to spend time. The music is BLARING, and the staff are not particularly attentive to customers. The coffee shop part of the business seems to be a second thought."}
{"text":"I live near here and frequently drop in to get coffee and every time I'm glad I went. They are very consistent with how they make drinks; something that many coffee shops in the area lack completely. The staff are very friendly and the atmosphere is very welcoming and clean."}
{"text":"First time I came here I was surprised how nice it was inside since its in a commercial strip mall. I just got a plain ole cup of joe. Definitely good coffee. When asking for a refill, they ran out of coffee and asked if I could wait. So I waited 10+ minutes and after the fact they said its $1. Had they informed me of the charge I wouldn't have waited. No harm, no foul I made it to where I needed to be, but you would think they would have waived the charge. That's why they get the score I gave them. How do you run out of coffee at a coffee shop??? Not sure if I'll return...."}
{"text":"The coffee is nothing too special. I enjoy trying local coffee places and since I live nearby, thought I would make stop while out running weekend errands. The signage isn't too big or bright so it's kind of hard to spot from the road. It was completely dead the morning I stopped by, despite there being some cafe seating. Weird.

My go-to try-order is normally an iced coffee or cold brew. The counter guy was nice to suggest the iced coffee over strong brew since I couldn't decide what to order. Didn't take long to make, but I think he forgot the sugar free vanilla I asked for [didn't start sipping until I got inside my car]. The coffee didn't really have much flavor sadly. The muffin I bought was obviously not made in-house. Good, but overpriced [almost $3 alone for the muffin I believe]."}
{"text":"I am here almost every morning. It's so nice to walk in and be greeted personally even if there is a line. They staff is super friendly and a great way to start a workday Monday. Great drinks. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The tea and sandwiches were great. They have a vast amount of people come through so it is excellent for people watching. Good books to read when  you drink your coffee!"}
{"text":"The inside of this shop is super comfy and reminds me of my parents' living room. The coffee is delicious and all of the baristas Are very welcoming. They even have smoothies and milkshakes! Note: I work here now, but I promise I felt this way as a customer at the beginning : )"}
{"text":"Amazing! Great taste, friendly customer service, easy location, great interior. I'll be going back for more as well as recommending this little place to everyone I know. Good job guys ^5"}
