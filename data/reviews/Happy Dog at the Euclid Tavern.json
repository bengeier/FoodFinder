{"text":"Great, one of a kind place. Good beer selection and the hot dog and fry customization options are super duper."}
{"text":"As someone who works close to this bar, getting off work around midnight isnt too bad whenever you have a good bar that you can get drinks and food at. Too bad they wont even stay open past midnight on any week day and still close up shop earlier than their sign says on weekends. We have been hustled out of their on multiple occasions and the bartenders never really seem like they want our business. Me and my friends sat at the bar top for 15 minutes while we waited for one of the three bartenders (who all walked past us on multiple occasions) to mosey on over and take our drink order.   Perfect definition of a hipster bar where the bartenders think they're too cool to wait on people. Welcome to the industry, gentleman."}
{"text":"My dog was a beautiful mess, overflowing with flavor. Portions are small,  but so is the price, especially if you plan for a tremendous amount of toppings. The $5 dog with unlimited toppings is a sweet deal with a brew. Actual hot dog size and quality is short of ideal, but flavor compensation is easy to manage. Tavern setting is more geared toward groups than solo bites,  with a homely and friendly vibe."}
{"text":"Location was pretty busy, and if your a first timer to Happy Dog it's pretty confusing if you sit down at a numbered table. Plenty of menus available, simple layout, easy to navigate, plenty of unique topping choices. Any bar that serves my Black Label rules, and this location does. However, it was an ok experience.    First hotdog was a coney-dog style. Hilly chili was decent, added with Irish cheddar, Spanish onions and yellow mustard. Really put off by how cold the hotdog seemed along with the chili. It was FAR from hot. Ate it without complaints. Tator tots were awesome, just wish there was more.   Second hotdog was a little better. Not hot, but definitely not as cold as the last. Added pulled pork, coleslaw, and a really unique white BBQ sauce I was a fan of. Fries this time were bland and something you would get in a school cafeteria. Should have went with the tots again. Avoid fries at all costs.    I might return now that I'm somewhat familiar with ordering. It took 10 minutes of sitting, waiting, looking over the menu for anyone to acknowledge and mention taking your menus up to the bar. Not really understanding the concept of that, especially after being seated at an actual table. Hotdogs \"cooked to order\"....allegedly. A return remains to be seen at this point.."}
{"text":"We were out with friends (adults) in Uptown on Saturday night.  After dinner, we decided we wanted to hear live music, so we walked over to Happy Dog.  When we walked in, the kid at the door just stared at us.  We asked if there was a cover and he said yes.  Then he said \"it is a younger crowd here tonight, sorry\" and did not let us in!  Were denied access for being adults!  I think Happy Dog needs to remind its employees that it is the adults who spend money and leave tips and therefore pay their paychecks."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick lunch before a CWRU football game. Menu allows you to customize all your toppings. Whatever you put on it, the dog itself is hearty and delicious, with the snap of a natural casing. My son and I split an order of tater tots, too, with the coffee ancho BBQ sauce. Great stuff! I'll be back when I'm in town. My son will likely be back well before then."}
{"text":"I attended a private party in the basement of this location recently, and was pretty pleased.  The party room is quite small, with just a bar and a few high top tables, but we had our own private bar tender and bathrooms.  The tots were better than I remembered!"}
{"text":"I made my 1st visit to the \"Happy Dog\" at the Euclid Tavern. Of course I had a hot dog with pulled pork and cheese and one topped with sloppy joe and brie cheese,odd combo I know, that's whats makes this place great, the combinations of hot dog toppings are infinite not to mention the plump all beef franks are very hearty. The side of well cooked tater tots was a nice touch, also  available to be topped with whatever you like up to and including fruit loops!  While I averted the fruit loops, its just nice to know that its there if you're feeling adventurous. Its a really good spot for hangover food, drinks and apparently they have live music there because we sat in front of what appeared to be a stage. Whenever I get back to Cleveland I will make a visit for sure."}
{"text":"It's a good place it's got good hot dogs but make sure you grill it does it taste funny when it's not real I had a special Spartan hot dog and I'll tell you what that was a killer that was so good and your tater tots are still excellent"}
{"text":"After coming back here a few times, I'm not really impressed with how business is being handled. I don't think things have been smoothed out yet, for it being such a simple concept. Happy Dog 1 4 lyfe.  The Tokyo Tuesday noodle thing was certainly an exciting addition and unusual special for a hot dog restaurant. I've tried to get these noodles 3 times and have only eaten them once. The first time, there was a weather related something or other (leak, burst pipe?) in the basement, which OK, not their fault. The second time, we actually got the noodles and my veggie ones were delicious, but my husband had some stomach discomfort after eating the pork. The third time, a friend and I came on Tuesday well after 7, and headed downstairs. There were 2 other girls downstairs, but no bartender, so we sat down and figured he/she was running an errand or gone to the bathroom. After a couple of minutes, getting settled in, we were met with some serious disrespect:  Guy: \"Uhh...what are you doing down here?!\" Us: \"Sorry?...\" G: \"WHAT are you doing down here?!\" Me: \"You have the noodles in the basement on Tuesdays, right?\" G: \"Uh, no, no, not today, you can't be down here. There's no bartender on staff! ::gestures like we were supposed to know:: I can't have you down here, no.\"  We gather our things and head upstairs feeling like scolded children--the stairs were not blocked off, there was no signage, no one stopped us from heading downstairs, the lights were on at the bar. How were we supposed to know not to head down there, expecting some dinner? He didn't apologize once nor did he explain why this particular Tuesday was different from another. Completely unprofessional way to handle the situation--not to mention we were disappointed, but not upset, so he could have just gently explained that noodles were canceled. Instead, he was rude and left me with a bad taste in my mouth.    We got hot dogs--not a problem--but I was missing a topping, which only added to my frustration with the whole place that night."}
{"text":"As a non hot dog person I was not super excited to see the menu. However I ordered the vodka slaw and three hot sauces and it was so flavorful I got over the fact that I was eating hazardous animals scraps in the shape of a tube. The tots at first struck me as meh, as in not Orida tots, however the sauces I ordered - again - brought them to a new level of yummy. I got the momocho, Piri Piri, Thai chili and housemate ketchup. Not sure what was what because none of the sauces looked like any of the restaurant or jar versions I've tried before so I just kind of mixed and went with the combined flavor which was spicy and garlicky and yummy. The only reason for the three rating is that I would have loved some wings or another food option and the ability to rate 3.5 vs 3 or 4. Forced choice is not the friend of business establishments. In a nutshell, a definite must try at least once when you decide to cast your health and wellbeing concerns to the winds and dive in."}
{"text":"Bar service was good, customer service was friendly, and the tots were ... well, tots. The sauces were great. The ketchup is what you'd expect, the garlic was good, the black truffle honey mustard had an awesome kick, and the Japanese yum-yum was our favorite! It's hard to describe the flavor, but sweet and sour sauce was as close as we could match the flavor (though the dipping sauce had a thicker consistency).   I liked the dim, intimate feel of the place. They also had great live music, and a lot of the tables were situated to face the stage (which is a great feature!)."}
{"text":"Brilliant concept - the toppings on my veggie dog were really tasty. Piri piri sauce and escarole on a Field Roast dog? And a great beer selection. Life is good. (P.S.: Sit at the bar for efficient service.)"}
{"text":"So I actually went here because I heard they had a decent amount of pinball machines lol.  My mom and brother were visiting from Chicago and they are obsessed with pinball so I took them here for a afternoon of hotdogs and pinball.  I'll start by saying I hate hotdogs so I did not order one.  My mom and brother on the other hand loves hotdogs and loved the hotdogs here!  For only $6 you get a giant hotdog with unlimited toppings.  We also ordered fries and tots which were only $4 each that were cooked to perfection!  I don't know how they do it but the fries and tots were perfectly crisp but not greasy.  They also come with unlimited free dips and for only $1 you can get unlimited toppings. If your looking for a fun affordable place to grab a bite to eat you should come check this place out :)"}
{"text":"Visited frequently while in grad school. Hot dogs were great, topped mine with bacon, cheese sauce, spicy mustard, mushrooms and an egg! Odd combination, but it always worked! I've seen even more unique ones with the amount of toppings they have, it could turn ugly quickly. My inner 6 year old is still obsessed with tater tots & theirs are amazing. The dipping sauces are out of the ordinary, but try a bunch! Great beer selection. Service was sometimes slow, especially with a limited amount of time for class breaks."}
{"text":"Me, a vegetarian, loving a hot dog place? YES!!! I love fun restaurants with quirky toppings for foods, and while I went for a pretty basic mac and cheese topping, the possibilities are great. Tots also have limitless options for dipping! And the fact that there was a meatless meat option is great if you happen not to not be a big hot dog fan.  Chill vibe, good service, and again- so many options for good beer with a huge list of things on tap. So overall: great place for quirky hot dog and good beer.  I'm looking forward to coming back again.  (I loved the Fallen Fruit from Masthead- nice if you don't like \"beer-y\" beer.)"}
{"text":"This spot felt like home away from home. Super welcoming and hip. Went here once during a weekend in Ohio for a festival. Felt comforting to be in a small venue with live music during my stay. They have great vegan hot dogs too! I enjoyed my time here."}
{"text":"PRAISE BE TO \"BOB\" AND THE GODS OF GOOD PLACES, THE EUCLID TAVERN HAS RISEN AGAIN!!  How long has it been since I've been here you ask...? I HAD A FLIP PHONE, THAT'S HOW LONG!  The old class of the Euc has been updated; new, intimate stage, combined with a very nice and well-stocked bar and ON TOP OF THAT, amazing dogs and tots with a million toppings via the powers of..THE HAPPY DOG!!   One of the only difficulties is the lack of parking, but via street, nearby lots, etc.,  you can find a place and enjoy the same ambiance you would on the other side of town...ONLY NOW IT'S HERE ON THE EAST SIDE TOO!   Me, I'm a happy dog to see the Happy Dog at Euclid Tavern's doors open again:)"}
{"text":"Happy Dog serves hot dogs, and veggie dogs, french fries, and tater tots. That's it. But they do it so well! You create your own dog by selecting from a long list of toppings. They all make a variety of sauces for the dogs and tots/ fries in house. Trust me, it's hard to just pick a few!  Happy Dog is certainly on my Top 10 vegan-friendly place to try in Cleveland! http://veganhostess.com/vegan-cleveland-restaurants-coffee-shops-more/"}
{"text":"What can you say about the awesomeness that is \"Happy Dog\" - I mean sure you get attentive kind super hip service, a city feel and some non traditional music, you get the option to make your food AMAZING and to branch out with flavor options - how many like a KAZILLION of you run the sauces toppings and mixes - do the math and message me - I'm so RIGHT.   The meat mix that is used for these dogs is non matchable - and perfection - casing crisp and garlicky flavored so that whether you cover it with chunky peanut butter and momocho mole, bourbon baked beans bacon bacon cabbage pulled pork and beer cheese, or some spaghetti o's fried egg and cheddar you are going to be EAR to EAR smiling - or else you filled out your sheet wrong...or didn't order tots Miss I'm on a Diet lady - there's no diets here!   And get a beer - a local or a craft PLEASE - they have a list to rival any of those uppity don't know crap about food or beer places.  This place has a different vibe than the location on W54th (which is one of my favorite places in Cleveland) but is different bad - no way!   Do it! Do it often! And get used to using those mini pencils for something way tastier than mini golf! See ya after your dog AND TOTS!"}
{"text":"Such a fun concept! You get a hog dog and get to stuff it with as many items as you want to make one massive, flavorful hot dog. Their chili is amazing and so are all their sauces. My husband and i loved the curried dijon mustard and the honey mustard. Their aioli sauce was also scrumptious."}
{"text":"Sit yourself. Take a form. Fill out what you want on your hot dog (UNLIMITED!!). Give it to your server. Eat!!!  $6 hot dog & $4 tots, fries, or sweet potato fries Lots of sauce choices; my personal fave is Brazilian Chimichuri!! Hard to pick between loading up your hot dog and eating downwards in the layers OR less toppings to make a better whole tasting hot dog. I personally love loading everything, but there are also \"favorites\" you can pick from if you can't decide. Not a bad place to overeat on classic American food!!"}
{"text":"Nothing beats $5 hot dogs with unlimited toppings! I am beyond ecstatic that they opened a new location in Uptown :) Now I can gain 100 pounds without feeling guilty because it's really on them, not me.   If you're new to Happy Dog, here's how it works! Find a table, fill out one of those scantron-like sheets with what you prefer on your hot dog (I recommend fried egg on EVERY hot dog, and don't feel guilty checking like 10 sauces because they come on the side!) and bring it to the bar to place your order! Make your taste buds EXTRA happy by getting a side of tater tots! Trust, you won't be disappointed :) The service is suuuuper quick. I came here with a group of 10, and our food came within 5-10 minutes! Amaze-balls."}
{"text":"Happy Dog was probably the ideal spot for a college student--open late, fast, filling and cheap, and they serve alcohol. This is not to say that only college students can enjoy it, but it definitely accompanied me many times when I was craving food in the AM.  The Food: +Dogs ($6): even though it is technically a hot dog, it really doesn't feel like you're eating one after you add all the crazy toppings you want. Despite the seemingly random mix of toppings to choose from, somehow it never seems to really clash in a bad way. I would hesitatingly suggest that sometimes less is more, and not overdo the toppings. Also, try to add some of the fresh toppings, which help your food from getting too heavy. +Tots/Fries ($4): as a french fry lover, it is rare for me to say this, but skip the fries and stick with tots. They are hot and crispy, and they give such a generous portion that it is sometimes hard to finish it off, even when you're sharing. +Sauces: Get as many as you want on the side for both your dog and the tots! It can be hard to tell which is which since they come out all at once, but that just adds to the fun. I just tend to stick with the Roasted Garlic Aioli.  One thing to keep in mind is that they often have bands playing here, so you'll have to pay a cover charge to get in. You can still order to-go though.  Overall, Happy Dog isn't any mind-blowing experience, but it is fun, and so affordable too. Definitely check it out if it seems like something you're interested in!"}
{"text":"Happy Dog v. 2.0. Happy Dog II. HDx2.  I just like HD part 1 better, I'm sorry.   I sometimes went to the Euclid Tavern as a wee youngster. It's totally different now and the ambiance just...sucks. It's simply not a comfortable place to hang. It's not easy on the eyes like HD v 1.0, ya know?  But...food is the same. So, there's that."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bar in Cleveland. The food is not gastronomy food but great hot dogs and tots. Also, the service is awesome!"}
{"text":"Expect to pay either an unnecessary cover charge or be told the kitchen is closed at any given time"}
{"text":"What a cool place! I adore that everything is personizable and you can get ANYTHING on either your dog or tots! Make sure to try lots of the dipping sauces because every one I've tried has been great. And they don't skimp on the toppings!   The perfect place to unwind after classes!"}
{"text":"My experience at Happy Dog started off quite awful and ended up with a happy ending. A group of four of us went the other day after the art parade to et some food, the place was crowded so we waiting to grab the first open table. Once finally finding a table we ended up waiting over 10 minutes for someone to come by and hopefully clean our table. The waitress cake by and told us she couldn't clean the table but the bus boy who was backed up would be by shortly. As someone who is also a server you can AND SHOULD HELP clean your tables. She didn't even bother to ask our drinks after that and just walked away. Another 20-30 minutes went buy and nobody came by. I understand to busy but come on at least say something nice to us or grab a drink. After waiting we ended up just asking the bartender to take our order, cleaned off the table ourself and grabbed our own waters. The bartender was super friendly got out food out which was AMAZING pretty quickly and even came by to check on us! Overall though we had a much better experience at the other location and probably will my be returning to this one."}
{"text":"I am not normally a fan of hot dogs, but this spot has VERY  good locally made hot dogs (franks), delivered quickly as ordered. I really like the assortment of condiments from the extensive (50 items) list. They also provide a line card to detail what is Vegan, Gluten Free, and Vegetarian. I recommend the tater tots as well. The Black Truffle Honey Mustard and Thai Chili and Garlic sauces were packed with flavor. No bark and just the right bite. Enjoy.   So the place really gets a 4.5 star review now that I see they have a game room to boot. Nicely done!"}
{"text":"Same sort of ambiance as Happy Dog West, a little more concert clubby than the other. The hot dogs, which of course are the shining glory, were decent. I'm not sure  exactly what it was I think it might have been the bun (which was a little stale) and the hot dog which wasn't hot and most of the toppings were like from the fridge cold so that wasn't awesome. I haven't had that experience at the Detroit Ave. location, so it was a little off putting. Very interesting crowd because of the area, the bartenders were nice. Would definitely go back, would love to go when there's a concert."}
{"text":"HUGE fan of this place, for obvious reasons. I would choose this location over the one in Lakewood-- but I heard they were redoing it so I guess I have to wait to decide after seeing the renovated one! Anyway, the tots are my favorite and I LOVE the dogs. This time, I decided to go for the vegan dog and it turned out to be more like a sausage with spices that I was NOT a fan of. It was kind of gross and upset my stomach. Next time, I am just going to go for the OG wiener."}
{"text":"Food was hot, service was good, parking was free across the street after 6pm.  On the plus side, I was the DD that night and the bartender kept filling my soda water without me even asking!  All too often I get ignored when I'm playing DD.  Good on ya!  Like many others, I have fond memories of the old Euclid Tavern and I'm happy to see it live again, even if it's not the actual Euclid Tavern of old.  I like this new upgrade.  Happy Dog brought back live music (and now comedy too) to the building and they have good dogs with great toppings.  There are a few toppings that differ from the West side location, which is nice.  The bulk of the toppings are the same, but the few differences give me just enough fun to make it unique.  They still use the same great (and I do mean great) all beef jumbo dog that doesn't taste like cutting-room scraps and the vegan sausage is still the same awesome sausage that even non-vegans love.  Overall, this is a great upgrade to the old Euc.  If want to eat good for just $5, stop in when you're around the area."}
{"text":"Endless hot dog choices. Good variety of brews and nice speciality cocktails. These are only a few of the pros of these place. The staff are quite friendly. Service is quick and the live music is nice."}
{"text":"Here's the deal.  Sit at a table, grab a slip of paper and get lost in all the crazy toppings you can put on a hot dog.  Some of the choices made me think \"why would you ever do that\"? But then again why not.  You can pile on as many sauces and toppings as you want for only six bucks.  If you wanted to be crazy with it and pile your dog a mile high- go for it! You can also get fries and tots which are definitely shareable with 2-3 people (you can also try different sauces with these as well).  Anyways cool concept and has a small stage for live music for later in the evening.  Go earlier in the night and there were some families with small kids.  Pinball machines and games in the back!"}
{"text":"My kids loved it u can get everything on ur hot dog and drinks lol gotta love this place"}
{"text":"Absolutely not a place to miss! Great live music, fun old brick atmosphere, great service and he hot dogs were so much fun to order. They have long lists of delicious things to throw on them with amazing prices!!!"}
{"text":"Legit best spot for tots on the west side of Cleveland. Good selection of craft beers and pin ball machines. Sweet."}
{"text":"Awesome little tavern.  Great food at a great price.  Easy to order, pick up a slip and check off your toppings, can't get any easier than that."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had so much fun here.  She got a crazy dog with almost everything including fruit loops and an egg. The most fun restaurant in many years."}
{"text":"Went here after the Feast in Little Italy.  Looks a lot like the Euclid tavern.  Great beer selection and good cocktails too. Bartenders were great.  Great hot dogs and tater tots.  Wish I stilled lived on Hessler St. In University Circle."}
{"text":"I'm torn. It's a really cool little venue and the hot dog idea is awesome, but I feel like they don't really care about the food that much.   My hot dog was *fine*, but my boyfriend's was cold and so were the toppings on it that one would think would require heat. When he told staff, they took it back and it came back to us in the exact same state so I'm pretty sure they didn't do anything to it.  The fries were hot, though, and delicious. And the dipping sauces were great. The truffle sauce was the best.   Anyway, we fought for the toilet when we got home so, coincidence?"}
{"text":"I've always been a huge fan of The Happy Dog, so I was excited for one to open on the East Side.  The food and drinks here are always on-point.  I've only had consistently delicious dogs, carbs and sauces here.  I've been here seven times since it opened and there have been a  few minor issues that have come up, so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt and chocking it up to them trying to find their stride.  The all-beef hot dog and the vegan Field Roast are equally delicious in their own right.  As an omnivore who enjoys all sorts of meat, I prefer the Field Roast here because it's so tasty.  Among my favorite toppings are the bacon spiked greens, garlicky escarole, banh mi pickled veggies and fried eggs.  They had curried peanut butter for a while, but didn't see it on the menu the last few visits.  I LOVED the curried peanut butter so I hope it returns.  The dogs used to be $5, but have recently been increased to $6.  The tater tots are always fresh and at $3 for a basket, a steal!  I always get them with the BBQ tumbleweed dust because it adds a nice slightly smokey note.  My favorite dipping sauces are the Rising Star Coffee BBQ Sauce, the Curried Dijon Mustard, Piri Piri Portuguese Hot Sauce, Garlic Aioli and Alabama Whie BBQ Sauce (slightly spicy).  Many of the sauces are complex and well crafted.  Also, I prefer the tater tots to fries, which aren't bad in their own right.  Also, the full bar and beer selection is excellent, making it a perfect place to hangout after work, for lunch or dinner and/ or late night.  Sometimes they have shows playing and you'll need to pay a cover at the door even if you just want to eat.  In some cases, they'll direct you to the rear entrance to go downstairs, which is a small, but cool space where you can eat without having to pay for the entrance.  Once I came during a concert and was told I had to pay the cover if i wanted to come in, even downstairs.  On another occasion, we sat ourselves at a table that hadn't been bussed.  We waited 5 minutes and no one came to bus it, so I had to go up to ask that someone clean off the table.  Someone came after about 5 more minutes.  We waited another 10 minutes for someone to take our order, but no one came, so I went up to the bar again to ask someone to please take our drink and food order.  5 minutes later, someone came by.  The kitchen, per usual was efficient and our food was delivered in a very timely fashion.  Now there was a short wait for tables that day, but it didn't appear to be very busy.  I will continue to come back to the The Happy Dogs.  Both of them together remain in my Top 5 favorite food spots in Cleveland.  I strongly encourage you to come eat, drink and see a concert here."}
{"text":"Favorite beer bar in C so far! Tried several German beers and tasted good. Didn't order too much food but definitely would give a shoot next time."}
{"text":"The beer selection is pretty good here. You will want to order a drink right away. It comes in handy for the ordering. Once I figured out how to order it went smoothly from there.   The hotdog was definitely really good. The menu includes things that pair well together. Use that as a guide if it's your first time. It helps when choosing your toppings.   The tater tots are normal tots. It's the dipping sauces that make them great. You can try any sauces that you like. I suggest to skip the plain ketchup. I didn't know any better and asked for ketchup."}
{"text":"Happy Dog should be called Sad Dog because it was probably The worst hot dog I've ever had. Im pretty sure this place has either told guests to give a high rating or has clientele that has never eaten \"decent\" food. It was borderline repulsive. I tried coming here twice several months apart and both times the hot dog was almost inedible.    Both times The hot dogs taste \"boiled\" not grilled and were not cooked enough. The second time I went it tasted as if my bun was soaked in water and when I went to eat it is was completely mushy. They need to get someone in there who actually cares about the reputation of the restaurant and they should have a complete redo. And the idea of filling out a long list of stuff that you can have on your hotdog in a dark space where you cannot hardly see the letters on the menu, and they give you dulled mini pencils to use is just awful. Get a real menu where you have different hotdogs that people can order and if people want to have add-ons great.   Just my opinion but I would never step foot in there again."}
{"text":"Happy Dog has such a unique vibe--the only place in town where you can get fruit loops on a vegan hot dog. They have an extensive beer and cider menu as well. Most importantly--they have PERFECT tater tots!! Crispy without being drenched in grease and they come with unlimited amazing sauces!!! Definitely go for the tater tots.   PRO TIP: all the $1 extras on tater tots are cumulatively only $1 -- not $1 each! Go crazy!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  5$ hot dog - beef or veggie with unlimited toppings.  I got banh mi slaw, fried egg, mushrooms, onions, yum yum sauce.  I stopped at one but was so delicious I could have eaten 3.  The tater tots are excellent and unlimited dipping sauces provides entertainment.  They have pinball machines and arcades.  I'm looking forward to my next visit.  Theres free parking after 6pm in a designated lot across the street!"}
{"text":"I nearly cried with happiness when I heard that Happy Dog was coming to the east side. Not that driving long distances for hot dogs has ever stopped me before. The Euclid Tavern is also a great spot for drinks, I hadn't visited before the revamping but it looks pretty cool and cozy with a stage and arcade games. And now you can have a hot dog in one hand and a beer in another, so pretty much your life is complete. Some of the toppings are a little different than the original location which is great 'cause it means even more experimenting! I challenge you to try toppings you wouldn't normally put on a dog (curried peanut butter!? black truffle honey mustard! froot loops?!). Make it your own."}
{"text":"Great prices and selection of items to put on your hotdog. I haven't been disappointed yet.  Also, I love the arcade in the back. I was beyond excited to see they had the old Ninja Turtles arcade game. Even my fave bar, 16-bit, doesn't have that game!"}
{"text":"So, we watch a video of a man going through Chicago eating hot dogs from all of the popular places and of course started to crave some dogs ourselves.   We ended up making our own at happy dog.  The chili with raw onions was wonderful. Even though I picked the toppings on the other dog, I wasn't a huge fan of what I picked. The garlic krout was a bit too much.  Tot with a fried egg, cheese and bacon was amazing! The place was clean and the service was great. We'll definitely return. Next time I'll skip the krout."}
{"text":"Happy Dog is one of the best \"chill\" places to eat a lot of great food that is quite cheap in Cleveland. I am vegetarian, and I must say, the veggie dog is excellent and does not taste like bland tofu AT ALL! I usually get a different fun mix of toppings every time, but I always top my hot dog with the macaroni and cheese and a fried egg. The fried egg is KEY. The tots are always a great addition to any meal and the best part is that you can order any number of sauces to go with the tots. Happy hour here is phenomenal! Overall, great place to get filling comfort food."}
{"text":"Nothing brings back childhood memories like hotdogs n tater tots. My husband has been bringing up happy dog to me for over a year now after he had it for the first time. As an adult I've somewhat turned my back on hot dogs, just because I'm still not certain what kind of meat they actually are, regardless. I recently was told they offer vegan hot dogs, and many have told me of their incredible tots. Finally while in the neighborhood I said we can grab lunch at happy dog. As a first timer I played it safe to really just focus on the vegan dog and tots. First of all the vegan dog is incredible and my 7 year old loved her original hot dog! The tots are perfection. Perfectly crisp and crunchy on the outside. After our first visit as a family we returned a couple weeks later to dabble a little more.  My daughter this round tried the burger with cheese and ketchup, as a 7 year old palette is very limited. She loved it. I had the vegan dog with onion, pico de gallo, and the chipotle ketchup. It was magnificent!! The hubs had loaded his dog with more than I can even list.   Basically the long and short of it is if you don't love what your eating you can blame yourself since you hand select all your toppings on the dogs and as many sauces as you want for the tots. Definitely a fun and unique spot. Not to mention a pretty expansive beer menu. We will absolutely be coming back to try new concoctions!"}
{"text":"Slamming veggie dog. They use field roast vegan sausages which are great, with unlimited toppings for $5. Can't beat it. Amazing selection of toppings as well-known from the classics to very unique (escarole, kimchi ketchup, fruit loops?!). And get the tater tots while you're at it."}
{"text":"I got sick. Reaaaaalllllllyyyyy sick.   Perhaps it was due to poor decision making in terms of what to put on the hotdog- fruit loops are perhaps too adventurous- but regardless, I'm not eating there again.   The music is also eardrum splitting. Not in a cool rock concert way- but in an \"I want to rip my ears off my head to make that piercing screech stop right this second\" kind of way.... Not fun. No thank you."}
{"text":"I don't get it. I really wanted to love it but I didn't. I don't think I'm cool enough to get it or something. The hot dog itself was eh, the toppings were eh, the sauces were eh. My teenagers loved it so they're fans. Don't not go on my account - you should totally try it. You're probably cooler than I am so you'll be fine.  P.S. Totally got hit up for money outside the front door by a couple clearly on something wicked. Not Happy Dog's fault, just a heads up."}
{"text":"Went here a couple nights ago and it was great. All three of us are regulars at the one on Detroit and all of us thought the food here was better. The portions weren't quite as big but the food was cooked perfectly and the sauces were better than they are on the west side. Weird, but we all thought that. And we all love the west side location too. Great addition to university circle!"}
{"text":"I love the menu options to choose what I want to put on my hot dog! You can pile it really high with some amazing toppings.   Great with beer. Good tap selection.   Fun atmosphere"}
{"text":"When you spend six dollars on a hotdog, I think it better be damn good, or at least damn drunk. Neither of these were the case at this ridiculous place. Don't waste your time or money.  I had some form of chili that tasted just a minute away from being thrown away. Stale cheese was on top (they didn't even bother melting it to cover it up). The bun was just as stale. The bartender was a rude hipster. I felt really silly for paying for this. I guess it's my fault."}
{"text":"It's a lot of fun to come here and try a bunch of different hot dog combinations. The toppings are endless (and most are free)! Definitely try this place out... Oh ya- NINJA TURTLES ARCADE IN THE BACK!!!"}
{"text":"Happy Dog at the Euclid Tavern is the place I take all of my out-of-town friends. Why? Because it delivers on all things Cleveland. Let me explain:  1. Music - Every time I've hit up Happy Dog I've been pleasantly surprised by the caliber of music coming from their intimate stage set up. The set, usually consisting of three or four solid acts is totally worth the small cover charge ($3-$5).   2. Hot Dogs and Tots - Remember those \"Scantron\" test forms you used to fill out in high school? Imagine if every time you turned one of those in, you got a really delicious hot dog and a basket of tater tots. Had that been the case, I sure would have studied harder! Every hot dog comes with unlimited toppings including, but not limited to, mac and cheese, chili, spaggetiOs, french brie, fruit loops, a sunny side up fried egg, and chunky peanut butter. Order a basket of tater tots and choose from unlimited dipping sauces like my favorite, the Brazilian chimichurri or black truffle honey mustard. With all these whimsical options, you may start feeling like a kid again. That is until you see the eclectic beer list...  3. The Tavern Part - This Happy Dog location, in comparison to their other spot in Lakewood, also prides itself in being half tavern (I think my uncle Rick is half tavern). The Euclid Tavern, before merging with Happy Dog, was a legendary live music venue, established in 1909. Us Clevelanders who enjoy the depth of our city's musical history can take pride in enjoying a brew next to the stage shared throughout the years by bands like The Pretenders and Green Day.   If you live in Cleveland and want to entertain that skeptical out-of-towner, take them to Happy Dog at the Euclid Tavern. It's divey, unique and truly Cleveland."}
{"text":"Five stars for impressive pinball collection, but three stars for having lesser food options than the west side Happy Dog. Overall, they've done right by the old Euclid Tavern, and the taps were plentiful and service was good. I just missed my usual toppings. In fact, I ended up skipping food here and going to the original Happy Dog to get my fix."}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff is friendly service is great. They are very vegetarian/vegan friendly.  Come in and use a small pencil to select your dog and multiple toppings. Your wait will be minimum throw back s cool one or two while you wait there is an awesome selection."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Burgers or hotdogs are a flat rate and you can add anything you want! Great price and great food!"}
{"text":"We are talking DAWGS. The choice is beef or VEGAN. Then add taters or fries plus toppings for both or dips for the taters. Thai chili is an amazing tater dip! The VEGAN dog tastes like a German sausage! Then add vintage sodas or any of over 50 beers!   Delicious. Attentive staff. Pin ball machines and performance stage. Inside a tavern where underage are OK! 5 stars for managing a very limited menu with top expertise, taste plus presentation plus service plus friendliness. Can it get any better? Probably not."}
{"text":"Had so much fun at private event in basement with our own bartender, dogs, tator tots and tasty sauces galore!  saw the Bone Lady and 2 different bands upstairs too."}
{"text":"So glad happy dog made it to the east side! This location is a little spacier than the one on Detroit. Hot dogs just as delicious...I prefer the veggie one, always with a sunny side egg and some of the meats (usually either Carolina BBQ or chorizo chilli) along with other toppings.   And of course don't forget tots and sauces on the side! Great beer selection. Chill environment with great service!"}
{"text":"One of the favorite end-of-work-day hang outs for the crew. Tater tots are a must. And get all the fillings you want with them! (My favorite is Korean BBQ dip)   As for the hot dog, you can put as many toppings as you please on them. (And some of the choices include fried eggs and fruit loops). I've only ever tried the vegan hot dog which tastes fantastic!   Live music plays most nights. There's alcohol - but nothing special to be said about that.   13/10 - would get all the tots and dogs"}
{"text":"$6 hotdogs and/or $6 hamburger with ANYTHING on it! Love it! The sauces are endless and I get a collection every time. Very decorative interior too and they have weekly events that usually involve live music!"}
{"text":"I went with a big group of friends on a Saturday night. There was a band playing, and the atmosphere is pretty typical bar atmosphere. A few of my friends got drinks, a few got hot dogs, a few got tater tots. I love the hot dogs, because you can get whatever toppings you want, and there are a LOT of choices, and its $5. I've gotten tater tots before and those are good too ($3). Their service is pretty fast as well."}
{"text":"This place doesnt hold a candle to the one in Youngstown!  Hot dogs are just so so and their beer selections are not too exciting either."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love hot dogs and tater tots with unlimited topping choices? I love Happy Dog on Detroit and this one is just as good and I almost like the layout better. The bar is up against the wall with tables spread out in front which almost seems to make it look bigger. The bar was extremely busy but the bartenders were very attentive and very good at making drinks. My Bulleit old fashioned was absolutely delicious and perfect. And just like the one on Detroit had a great beer selection as well!! I would definitely recommend checking out and its nice for East siders to finally have a Happy Dog they can call their own!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try Happy Dog for awhile. I was actually planning on going to the one on the west side, but stumbled across this one when I was looking for something to eat in University Circle. It's actually in a great location if you're at one of the local museums and want to walk to dinner.  Happy Dog is definitely more of a dive bar establishment. You walk in and seat yourself, you get waited on by multiple people, food comes out fast, and service fairly slow. Our waitress was nice and answered all out questions, but wasn't very proactive about asking us if we had ever been there and if we had any. In the end we figured out the menus and ordered.  We ordered hotdogs and tots (The only two things on the menu). I ordered a customized hotdog, which cost five dollars no matter how many toppings you get on it. I like this because a lot of places that do build your own food add up quickly. The hotdog was great - I got pulled pork, coleslaw, onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, white bier cheese, and ketchup. We also got tater tots with bacon and fried egg on top. You can get a number of sauces either on your hot dog or for dipping. My two favorites were the Alabama BBQ sauce and the kimchi ketchup.  Overall I thought the food was great and pricing was cheap. Since I ended up not paying for the tots I got out of Happy Dog for $7 with tip. Cheap enough to head for ice cream next door after dinner!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! It's such a bang for a buck!  It has options for vegetarians too. The tater tots are so good, with literally a million sauces to choose from, and its no charge unless youre adding actually toppings to your tots. (Same with the fries). Tots and fries are $3, with $1 for extra toppings. The veggie dog is so good...some say it's even better than the normal dogs but I wouldn't know because I haven't tried the real hot dogs. I promise you though, you will not regret giving happy dog a chance!!! The hotdogs/veggie dog is $6.  (Just a personal favorite, GET THE EGG. its a weird combination, but its so good!!)   There is a bar and its dimly lit but there is a back section where is a little bit brighter with more tables to sit at.  Definitely check this place out :) It's my fave and everyone seems to love this place."}
{"text":"It starts with a tiny pencil and a piece of paper reminiscent of a scantron sheet. You fill in the little circle next to classic all-beef hot dog or vegan sausage, and then the adventure to building the perfect dog begins. There are all kinds of options for toppings ranging from ketchup to Froot Loops. Pick as many as you'd like! Flip the sheet over and get yourself some tater tots, then fill in some more circles next to the dipping sauces (they are all good).   The vegan sausages are amazing. I am not vegan, but actually prefer the taste of it over a hot dog. I usually get mine with pimento mac and cheese, which is delectable. The tots and the dipping sauces (you can get as many dipping sauces as you'd like, which is always fun) are delicious. They have a great selection of beers on tap and in bottles. My go-to is Bell's Two-Hearted Ale. This location tends to be less busy than the Detroit Avenue location, which is perfect for my taste. The staff is all very accomodating and efficient. The food comes out quickly. There are also pinball machines in the back room, which makes me love the place even more. There is usually pretty cool/obscure music playing when there isn't a band, which is very nice. I freaking love this place."}
{"text":"A neat little place with a nice bar, good service, and a simple menu. The menu here consists only of a hot dog or hamburger, and fries or tater tots. What makes this place fun is that there is a wide selection of toppings, and sauces you can have put on a hot dog or hamburger. The toppings range from traditional stuff like onions, pickles, relish, ketchup, and mustard to untraditional stuff like Spaghetti O's, Fruit Loops, and Korean BBQ sauce.   When I went, I had a hamburger which might be new on the menu. The burger was pretty good, and the selection of toppings I picked were spot on. The bar has a typical dive bar feel, its old wood, with a couple of TVs. The selection of beer and booze were good, and the bartenders kept my glass filled until I said stop."}
{"text":"Me + Happy Dog = OTP. God, I love this place. While we have Dirty Frank's in Columbus, Happy Dog is a bit of a different animal. Do they even have a \"traditional\" menu anymore? We didn't see it at Euclid Tavern, but let's be real - we didn't need it.  Euclid is fairly small, but clean and the service was friendly for a Sunday lunchtime. Couples (us), families, groups, tourists/visitors - everyone was represented at Happy Dog ET.  Never been to Happy Dog? GET IN HERE. You get to make your own hot dog, it's awesome. Vegan? NO PROBLEM. They have a) beef and b) vegan dogs to choose from. You pick your toppings (other meats, veggies, toppings ranging from chili to fruit loops), sauces and either fries or tots on the side.  While all the choices seem a bit fraught with dangerous possibilities, it's not all that difficult to make an awesome happy dog. The spouse did what he called \"Mongrel dog\" - beef hot dog, caramelized onions, Bahn Mi veggies, curry mustard. I made a \"Bahn Mi dog\" - veggie dog, minced onion, cucumbers, garlicky escarole, Bahn Mi veggies, Thai chili sauce and sriracha. SO GOOD.  We got a bunch of sauces with our fries and tots and cleaned-plated it all, no mean feat!  If you're in the UC section, you gotta try the Happy Dog here."}
{"text":"We went here Friday night because it was close to our hotel. It was a fun time! They had a band playing that was super fun and it was a great crowd. I ordered a mixed drink, shot and beer for my husband and I thinking oh lord we're in Cleveland it's going to be like 30$ nope under 20$! Great service and atmosphere!  I highly recommend trying it if you like a pub-tavern feel!"}
{"text":"You don't know how magical this place is until you try it so take my word on it and TRY IT! I recommend macaroni and cheese with Buffalo sauce. The combinations are endless!!!"}
{"text":"Happy Dog has a sold veggie dog and so many toppings and sauces! Very affordable prices for both their dogs. I liked their fries more than tater tots, but both were good. Sometimes they may have events going on so you might want to check before you go."}
{"text":"The star is solely for the food, which is pretty good. Unfortunately the experience is pretty much ruined due to the nonexistent service. During the hour and 40 minutes spent here, it took us 40 minutes to receive our hot dog, hamburger, and tater tots. We then sat for an hour awaiting our check, as our server avoided eye contact/any attempt we made to try to get his attention. During the two interactions we had with the server (ordering and getting our food), he wasn't very friendly. Eventually we had to go up to the bar and have the bartender ring us up. If you have two hours to spend getting fine but not outstanding food, the atmosphere is pretty cool due to the taverns history."}
{"text":"Peanut butter, pulled pork and mac and cheese on a hot dog? Yes please!  This place is great, you can get a ton of food for $9 and they usually have good food specials.  Definitely a good place to take someone from out of town as it is a unique concept."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, I've never been to to the other Happy Dog location, so I don't have that to compare to.  That being said, I really liked the laid back atmosphere of this place! The bartenders and servers were really friendly and the food was quick.   At first we didn't realize that you could put as many toppings as you want on the dogs AND you get as many dipping sauces for the tots as you want. As a general rule, I LOVE foods that come with multiple dipping sauces. So fun!  I had the veggie dog and it was pretty delicious! My husband had the beef dog and he liked that as well.  So, overall we were pretty happy with the food and drink selection.   Then, this place has pinball! Not a huge number of machines, but definitely some fun ones. I'd like to go back to play that AC/DC machine a few more times.   Another nice feature is that there is a parking lot for the Euclid Tavern right across the street from it - thank goodness, since we came on a night that was a snowy mess with temps below zero.   I think I'd really like to see what this place is like in the summer!"}
{"text":"I always get sick here, not because the food is bad, but because the tots are so damn good and I always \"accidentally\" overeat.  I've been here a few times now, so I consider myself a happy dog pro.  They have 50 cent wing night on Monday, but they don't have too many sauces or rubs to choose from.   The real star is the hot dog and tots. Tots come with your choice of sauces, and the waiter can usually fit 6 in a tray. You can get more though, if you ask nicely. Their secret fry sauce is one of the best. It also goes nicely on a hot dog, which has the option to include some weird things like fruit loops and spaghetti o's.  The food is greasy but good. In true dive bar fashion, Happy Dog also has extremely cheap drinks. A domestic will set you back $3, only a dollar less than a well drink, and imports are about double. It's a good vibe and the venue also features live music sometimes, according to the schedule."}
{"text":"Design your own hot dog with all of their crazy toppings and sauce choices. What more could you want along with a cold beer? Seriously. I don't even like hot dogs other than the ones at Happy Dog and I dream about these."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot or happy hour or really whatever.  Fun place, great music and overall a neat place to come for a cold beverage. I would have given them five stars but the staff seemed kind of sad to be working, may be because it was during the week, I don't know but cheer up, you'd make more in tips. Yay! Great place overall."}
