{"text":"I went to this restaurant for my cousins birthday. The entrees were descent but when we (several tables) asked to have more pita bread for the humus, we never received it. The service was very slow and disorganized. Some of us were served 45 minutes after the first plates were served. Some people got fed up and left. My chicken tajine wasn't great. In the past when I ordered a tajine it was a full course with lots of couscous and vegetables. This half chicken leg was served with gravy all over, olives and French fries. The serving wasn't generous and to be frank...it looked like a chicken,olive Poutine. The chicken was good though and well cooked! I paid $116 for the entire night...steep for what I received. Needless to say I would not go back. Peeps to the belly dancers!"}
{"text":"This hidden jewel of a place was a totally unexpected find - we simply stumbled inside to gain shelter from the rain but ended up leaving 3 hours later!  This Canada Day, we had gone to watch the gorgeous fireworks in the Old Port and had an amazing time. The atmosphere was so lovely, despite it being a very hot and humid day. Having got there a little early to get a good spot, we had not had dinner yet. As soon as the fireworks ended, heavy rain and thunder started and people were running frantically. All the restaurant canopy areas and shop entrances were packed so we hurried onto one of the narrow side streets and entered through an open back door that appeared very confusing to begin with. There were stairs leading down to the actual entrance of the place, which was dark with disco lights flashing. From the loud Arabic music, we guessed we had walked into a middle-eastern nightclub of some sort. We stood a while at this secluded back entrance, waiting for the rain to stop until we saw a family go down and enter the place. We were curious, so we too followed and to our surprise, this was a full-fledged restaurant with a dance floor and bar area too. We loved the vibe, the stunning arabesque d√©cor and comfy cushioned benches so we ended up staying for hours.  The menu has a lot of choice - there is a terrace menu consisting of usual fast-foods (burgers, pastas etc) and for inside, a traditional tasting menu (as well as A la Carte). I absolutely loved this selection, you can try so many Moroccan delicacies for a decent price. Our waitress told us that the price was reduced for the tasting menu (32$ p/person instead of $42) as we had come around 11pm and the main feature (belly dancing show) had already ended.  The food was absolutely delicious, cold and hot mezzes (eggplant dips, salads, olives, hummus, chicken pastries etc) and a choice of the main meal. We opted for the 'Tajine Mech Mech' - tender lamb cooked with pear, apricot and nuts which was served with a delicious vegetable couscous! It was to die for... the meat just melted in my mouth and the flavours were phenomenal. For an unplanned dinner, this definitely exceeded our expectations! To top it all off, we were served fresh hot mint tea with Arabic pastry desserts (not baklava... it was something I have never tried before but again, delicious!).  Service was a little slow, due to a lack of staff but we did enter at 11pm! Despite it being late, I found everything freshly made, which made the wait time well worth it.   Very very impressed! I will definitely be back, this time earlier to catch the spectacle!!"}
{"text":"Where to start... Here is how i celebrated the 150th anniversary of Canada   After viewing beautiful fireworks in the old port the night of July 1st, at 10:30 pm it started to rain and shower very hard, everybody was running to find shelter from the rain, my better half pulled me into this arab lounge looking place until the rain calms down.. We go a little curious and took the stairs that went straight down from the entrance and saw signs for the bathrooms .. like Secret Agents we went to dry ourselves. We then headed towards the entrance of the eating area and found a gem  There is live music and belly dancing but we got there couple of minutes later and missed out but because the show was over we got a menu at reduced price  They have a \"terrase\" menu which is the usual burger, fries, nachos etc and they have a taste all traditional (42$with the show or 32$ after the show) we got approx 5 nice cold appetizer (greek salad, olives, eggplant, hummus and marinated carrots hot bread), a choice of main meal (tajine, salmon mix grill etc)  We then were served a hot chicken pastry topped with honey and almond (looked like a dessert but it was a sweet n salty bite)  We then got our main meal ; lamb tajine cooked with prunes, apricot and almonds ! It was just cooked to perfection and the lamb was melting in my mouth  We had love minth the and very good and fresh dessert  The service was good even with limited staff, at first it seemed like they werent quick until we received each of our plates one after the other very hot n fresh, you can tell it was cooked couple of seconds before ! Will go back for a dansing evening dinner ;)  I recomend"}
