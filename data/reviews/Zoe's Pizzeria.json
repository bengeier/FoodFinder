{"text":"Ordered the works pizza and it was amazing. Great crust, sauce and Italian sausage thin sliced veggies. Garlic knots came out hot and fresh. I will definitely drive out of the way for this place."}
{"text":"We love this place. They have great pizza, fast delivery and fresh toppings. It's also a great place to go or a quick lunch. There are lots of topping to choose from. It is a little more expensive than the chain pizza places, but Zoe's has better pizza and toppings. The staff is always nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Perfect family pizzeria. No fancy schmancy artisan pizzas, just good hand tossed pizza like you had when you were a kid. Very well made, yummy crust and nice simple salad options. Awesome old school arcade games like Pac man, Donkey kong, Galaga and Centepede for 25 cents to keep the kids occupied like the good old days. Very clean restaurant and friendly people."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Waunakee, by far.  Not quite on the same level as Roman Candle but for Waunakee it's fantastic."}
{"text":"Zoe's is our \"go-to\" pizza place in Waunakee.  Our favorites are the Trenton tomato and the Mediterranean.  The crusts are done well and the sauce has a great taste."}
{"text":"The food is good. Their pizza sauce is very tasty and the crust is just right. The slices are a little small, though. The staff isn't always the nicest...I've watched them talk about customers while they were right in front of them!!! Also...they don't wear gloves when they touch your food.  Even-so, one of the better pizza places in the area."}
{"text":"We love Zoe's! Anytime we have family in town, this is what we order! Always done in a timely manner, and you can most always find a coupon to help ease the cost. But let me assure you, it is worth every penny. And don't forget an order of garlic knots!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza a few days ago for delivery. The delivery driver was the best part of the experience. The pizza was a real disappointment. All of the toppings were in the middle making the pizza a greasy limp mess!!! It's to bad since there isn't a lot of choices in the area either."}
{"text":"A bit out of the way, I was quite happy to find this place.  The pizza was quite good, and the people that worked there were very nice as well.  They have a nice variety of toppings and choices for sauce and crust: I got the garlic cream sauce chicken pizza, and it was very tasty."}
{"text":"Tasty pizza, friendly service.   I've only eaten Zoe's pizza once, but I know I'll be eating it again.   The online ordering was very easy, and my pizza was ready right on time. The staff people there were friendly.  The crust \"crunch\" was just right, and the toppings definitely were fresh, and the pizza had lots of flavor. I also ordered a house salad, which to my surprise, was full of darker greens. Zoe's doesn't hand out a wad of iceberg lettuce, which is quite nice!  I've eaten on a few occasions at other nearby pizza joints (another in Waunakee, yes,) and Zoe's by far is the best."}
{"text":"We love their pizza but Christ is it expensive. Not sure the quality is equal to the price but we could go to a restaurant with tip and be cheaper. Again it's awesome but we'd go back more if not so pricey. Maybe their rent is high--or I am?"}
{"text":"Zoe's provided community support to the Waunakee 2017 post Graduation activities.  As always, the pizzas and other items were of the highest quality.  Can't go wrong with Zoe's."}
{"text":"I saw the pic of the Margherita Pizza and decided to order it-  Sooo disappointed by the fact that they DO NOT put fresh tomatoes on their pizza LIKE THE PICTURE- it's just cheese and basil.  I called them to ask about it - just to get a response of \"we don't put tomatoes on ours since here's tomatoes in the sauce\"......  I just paid over $20 for a cheese and basil pizza- never again.  Btw- the owner was suppose to call me back- I waited and haven't heard from her."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in the area. The delivery is always a reasonable wait and the staff is always friendly on the phone and in person. Not only is the pizza good, but I'm also a big fan of the salads and fettuccini Alfredo!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza. Delivery is good and they support online orders. Wish the online system was better, but at least they have it. Don't pass up the Mac and cheese pizza, it's the best we have had. Only constructive criticism about the food is that sausage shouldn't have clean knife cuts. It's somewhat off putting."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but their cracker thin crazy pepperoni is the best in town. Garlic knots are a must!"}
{"text":"Tried it again last week - done with this place. 16\" pie had the topping of a 10\". 2-3\" wasteland of empty  soggy crust around the edge, thin on the cheese and sauce & few lonely peperoni.   Sad but looks like quick trip has become best pizza option in Waunakee. Best pizza in Waunakee only makes Zoe's the tallest midget by default.. I think they've got worse  since they moved to new location. Understand expenses but they kicked prices up fair amount too. Delivery or take out - open the box before you or the driver leaves.  Decent baked spaghetti and I think their  Trenton Tomato  is good when you get it there ."}
{"text":"This place while not fancy is a hidden gem, the Pizza is great! This is coming from a Brooklyn, NY guy where they have the best pizza in the world! Also the staff here are all great friendly and polite... Carlos is so nice you will want to return!"}
{"text":"Overall, I think Zoe's Pizza is good quality and has excellent flavor, but the prices are way too high for the area and not necessarily equal to the quality. I would be more willing to pay their prices if they were located in downtown Madison or somewhere near campus. I would visit more if prices were lower."}
{"text":"Zoe's is the place for pizza in Waunakee. Good crust comes in several options including a hand tossed thin crust that is a household favorite. Creative and tasty pizza options with generous toppings and fresh ingredients. Kids love the butter/garlic knots to munch on. Staff are really friendly. Have used both pick up and delivery - both offer timely service. Very nice new space for dining-in. I would rank Zoe's pizza among the best pizza places in the Madison area."}
{"text":"Definitely the best pizza in Waunakee.  Kind of out of the way and easy to overlook but worth tracking it down.  They deliver, as well..  Excellent crust, great options for both sauce and toppings.  Everything we have tried has been really good.  People who work there are super nice.  There is some space for dine-in but we have only done carryout."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Waunakee  While I wouldn't rate this as my fave pizza in the Madison-area (Salvatore's in Sun Prairie and the Greenbush Bar share that esteemed title), Zoe's serves up a decent pizza pie.  I appreciate that Zoe's offers three crust options (Hand Tossed, Regular Thin or Cracker Thin) since the family and I don't share the same crust preferences .  From a textural standpoint, the crust at Zoe's has the right combination of both bite and chew,  I just don't find the same level of flavor as the crusts at the aforementioned Salvatore's and Greenbush.  The red sauce is better than average.  While it does not offer much herbal complexity, it does not have that \"out of the can\" taste.  There are four other sauce options (alfredo, BBQ, ranch and olive oil) if you are looking for something a little different.  Besides the standard mozzarella, there are three other cheese options (fresh mozzarella, feta and cheddar).  My dad always mixed in a little cheddar one the pizza he made, so I utilize that option when I'm feeling nostalgic.  Our household is also a big fan of feta cheese, so we utilize that option quite a bit.  The six meat options are pretty standard.  It would be nice to have a more upscale option like prosciutto.  Topping quantities are generously applied.  The same can be said about the 16 veggie topping offerings.  The are generously applied, but there are no real gourmet options.  The kids LOVE the garlic knots as an appetizer - I can take them or leave them.  There are a variety of pasta offerings, sandwiches and salads on the menu as well.  I have not given them a try yet, so you are on your own if you choose to wander off the pizza reservation...  The staff are friendly and the carryout pizzas are always ready on time.  Zoe's recently moved into a more spacious setting, so they now offer a dine-in option.  If you are looking for a good pizza in the 53597, this is the place you need to go."}

{"text":"My favorite pizza place in the area. My favorite is their The Works - basically the supreme. Big YUM!   I tend to go for lunch and order out. You can get slices during lunch so it's quick and easy. They have a bunch of different specials like 2 slices and a drink at good prices.   You can eat in or take out. They moved a while ago allowing for more dining in space.   My boyfriend also really likes their garlic knots.  Short on time? Want some za? Come here!"}
{"text":"Pizza is really good (I like the cracker thin crust) and service is fine, but the food here is extremely expensive. A single 16\" pie with half plain cheese and half sausage is literally $19.  I have never seen a coupon for this place and have not heard of any specials. Could get more than twice the amount of pizza down the street at Pizza Hut (no exaggeration) for that price. Sure the 'Hut's pizza isn't quite as good, but still...  I'm certainly willing to pay more to support a local place, but not 2x+ more.  Giving this place 3 stars just based on low bang for the buck.  Will still visit occasionally since at least the pizza is good."}
{"text":"Extremely pricey for what it is.  Decent pizza. Have waited an hour and a half for delivery. We're in waunakee, how is that even possible?"}
{"text":"I can only review their delivery pizza as I didn't physically step in here, but it was great.  They have gluten-free pizza on the menu which is a giant plus for our family.  Delivery was quick, polite and the pizza was still hot and fresh.  Nothing was outstanding, but it was an affordable pizza delivery option because Pizza Hut shouldn't be the only option out there."}
{"text":"Overpriced.  The pasta tasted like the sauce was burnt.  Had to throw out a full order of ziti.   Tried Zoe's three times, each disappointing.  Just not good and really expensive.  Sadly I'd rather go with the national chain pizza for delivery."}
