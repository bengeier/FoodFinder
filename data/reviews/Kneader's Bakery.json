{"text":"Our office ordered from here today. The sandwiches were burnt pretty bad. They also got our order wrong. We had high hopes but were severely disappointed. We recommend places to eat to our whole office. Kneaders will not be on that list."}
{"text":"OVER RATED & OVER PRICED...The baked goods are awesome!!  They should Stop making SANDWICHES....because they are not good at all...& it's a shame to all the Deli's around who know's how to make sandwiches.  Just stick to your baked goods. My Reuben Panini should have been a Sauerkraut Panini instead because there was hardly any meat....not good !!"}
{"text":"The food at Kneaders is good - if they have it! I sat in line tonight for thirty minutes and when I placed my order I was told they were out of pumpkin pie. It's 5pm on a Friday I don't understand how they can't have enough pie to get through a Friday dinner rush! Needless to say my 7 month pregnant self was extremely disappointed. On numerous occasions when stopping at this location I am told they are out of this or that - usually soup. They need to up their quantities or they will be losing a lot of frustrated customers that want to know if they come here they can get the items they are looking for!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent.  My low rating is for the poor customer service.  I was getting something to go and stood by the 1st register for at least 5 min.  No acknowledgement from any staff.  The girl at the 2nd register was taking someone's payment and when they were finished I walked over to her and asked if I was supposed to order at 1st register.  She replied \"It's closed\".  There was no sign to state that.  She was not rude, but not pleasant either.  My order came out pretty quickly and it was correct.  But I never go back to a place that has poor customer service!"}
{"text":"Very inconsistent.... I ordered the southwest chicken salad and it was completely missing the avocado.... it's a $10 salad so you'd hope for everything that comes with it. The drive through can take up to 30 min sometimes also...."}
{"text":"Avoid this Kneaders if you want popular items on their menu. On multiple occasions they have been out of things toward the end of the day. The staff is friendly and the service is fast, but they are apparently unable to figure out how to keep items stocked 'till the end of the day."}
{"text":"Fresh sandwiches and salads but a little pricey. Sandwich comes plain with nothing on the side. Deserts look and taste great. Oddly they don't have any napkins. I liked the fresh food and will come back"}
{"text":"love the soups and the sweets!! and they have drive-thru! a tad bit expensive and AC is high inside."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love there bake goods and most of there food! There soups are really hit or miss on what's good and I love there homemade chips! When they are made right. My one big issue is drive through takes forever for the food even when your the only one in line . And there weird set up makes for a very cramped space to order inside. It's not for everyone but it's worth trying when you want bakery food."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Customer service was excellent even with it being so busy on opening day! Highly recommend Three Cheese Cauliflower soup and Asparagus soup!  Asiago bread was absolutely delish!"}
{"text":"This location is constantly out of regular menu items. When they have the food - it's great, but often times when your order something they tell you they are out of it."}
{"text":"Been there 3 times and each time its like i bother them.to order anything,.noone smiles and just get mean looks it seems, the service is super slow and never going back, Sunflower bread is 100% better"}
{"text":"Kneaders came highly recommended by a friend who absolutely loves their artisan breads.  Unfortunately for us they didn't have any loaves left when we got there for dinner.  We got their Chicken Pesto, Chicken Salad and cheesecake.    All of them we tasty and filling.  We liked it enough to get a couple extra desserts to go.  Perhaps we can get there early enough next time to get some loaves to go."}
{"text":"As I'm writing this review...I am in my car in the drive thru and have been waiting for 15minutes for an iced mocha! There was no line in front of me. I called while in my car and talked to a manager...all he said is they're trying to fix the chocolate pump for my iced mocha!...i ordered my drink at 2:49 and it's 3:08 and still waiting!"}
{"text":"Waited in drive thru line for 10 mins behind 1 car who ordered a single coffee.  When I finally got to the window the girl was moving very slow and not at all apologetic, she handed me the wrong coffee and then took another 2 mins before giving me the right coffee that was so full I couldn't even stick my straw in it without it spilling over.  I asked to talk to a mgr who could care less about what I was telling him...he didn't even apologize!  Prices are the around the same as starbucks and this was the 3rd time I waited so long in line.  I also ordered a cinnamon bun that tasted like butter and was cold.  Soooo not worth the wait..."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday afternoon and ordered a turkey, avocado and bacon salad. The boy who took my order asked if it was to go or dine-in, and I said it was for dine-in. My salad was delivered less than two minutes later in a to-go box, on a plastic serving...bowl? basket? Some kind of paper lined thing that made no real sense. There was apparently no choice of dressing--it came with two containers of ranch. The salad was okay, but obviously had been pre-made, and had a large piece of extremely wilted and obviously brown of lettuce.   My companion ordered a pannini sandwich also came before she even made it to sit at the table. The sandwich was just...horrible. She couldn't eat more than a couple of bites and said it tasted like it had been made earlier in the day, then microwaved to super-heat it before it was tossed on a pannini press to brown it a bit. The result was an extraordinarily hot, soggy sandwich that was basically inedible. She asked to see the manager, and when he appeared, she told him her meal was horrible and inedible. He said he was sorry, and did we want him to have it \"remade.\" When she refused, he just said, \"Okay, sorry.\" and took the plate away. No refund was offered or given, nor was she offered a different menu item as compensation, so she basically just had to sit and wait while I finished my meal, with nothing to eat for herself.  Poor customer service and food that was marginal at best. I will not be returning, and I don't recommend that anyone else does, either."}
{"text":"I like Kneaders but this one has the worst service by far, and I am basing it off more than ten trips. Last time was a 13 minute wait at the drive thru, and this time they've been open for 30 min and still don't have breakfast items on the menu ready to order. Disappointing. Love the location in Queen Creek and the employees there are very nice as well."}
{"text":"Every time I visit I order a salad, although it's always fresh the toppings are very minimal. Today I ordered the avocado salad and expected to be able to see the avocado for $9.  It's nice to have healthy options for fast food, but I'd like to get what I paid for."}
{"text":"Very, very good food.  Tastes fresh, nothing seems processed.  I haven't had one thing yet that I didn't like.  Only complaint is have is the wait for the drive thru.  I know fresh food takes longer, but when you're told that only one person is working the window while watching another employee doing figure 8's so he looks busy is a little frustrating to say the least, especially for a cup of soup and a large Coke.  I would have thought that after the wait is already endured I would pull up, pay, get my food and leave....but no.  Another 10 minutes, for a cup of soup and a Coke.  Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I want to say food is good.  Please Do Not purchase any retail products!  I purchased a 80$ purse and used it for 1 week and a strap started coming apart.  I took it in a week later and was told all retail sales are final!  Sorry!!!  You can take it and get it fixed.  Wow!!"}
{"text":"Was so happy when Kneaders opened near us, I had only been to them in Utah. Love their sandwiches and baked goods. They usually have samples of their bread near the register for you to try, we often buy loaves of bread from them...they are delicious.  Really great Chocolate Chip cookies and other seasonal baked goods. Only bummer is that the lines can be long and that they are not open on Sunday's."}
{"text":"Normally the service here is slow and there is an issue with being understaffed. Today took that to a new level. After ordering we were told it would be a 15 minute wait, it was a 1 hour wait and numerous people complained to the staff about the time that it took to make the food.   NEVER have I seen anyone clean a table in this place. It's disgusting based due to the type of food served. They seriously need to have more people working to clean as people leave.   The management is unresponsive and really couldn't seem to care if people are happy when they leave or not. The staff is equally apathetic.   I'll be hesitant to return with many other options available nearby."}
{"text":"No good..sorry Kneaders..you'll never be Paradise Bakery. Our first visit was so bad and the sandwiches were awful that they gave us two free sandwiches for our next visit and those were just as bad....service is also poor. Save yourself time and stick with a classic like Paradise Bakery or Flancers. (Heck.. save yourself a ton of money and just go to Subway in the same shopping center as the quality is about the same). Kneaders sandwiches are all bread..no meat."}
{"text":"Great service and food. They are always really nice. Their breakfast is my favorite!  Try their endless French toast it's the best. I also like their omelets. The American is my favorite. There are options for everyone. A good variety of treats. Their orange rolls are delicious. I haven't had something bad here."}
{"text":"I did not have any luck finding a Panera anywhere close. As I was driving I saw Kneaders and thought I would give it a try. I ordered a sandwich that comes with chips. I asked if I could get something other than chips such as fruit or pasta salad. I know when substitutions are made there may be a price increase which is just fine. I was told that they do not do substitutions even for an addirional charge. What restaurant does not offer that? I am truly shocked and extremely  disappointed especially since I just paid $11.79 for a large drink and just a sandwich. I certainly will not be back. This is my first and last visit to a Kneaders."}
{"text":"I was on my way home from a late class and wanted something quick. I rarely eat fast food and between the 60 and my house there is only kneaders or McDonald's-there was no way I was eating McDonalds. As this was my first time I quickly looked over the menu and ordered the reuben panini. After a long wait (by any drive through standards) I paid $9.04 and went home with my sandwich. I understand that these were wide slices of bread, but where was the filling?? Literally only a few slices of beef, and an equally thin layer of cabbage. While the ingredients were good that was in no way a $9 sandwich. And the pickle spear didn't make up for it. I may go back to try a pastry, I've heard they're amazing, but the actual food is a complete rip off."}
{"text":"I won't be \"kneading\" this place again... It sounded good, but the sandwiches where pretty disappointing. I got the turkey and cranberry croissant. It was rather bland and lacked the gusto that the picture showed. Oh well. The staff seemed pretty nice though. I'm not mad I tried it, I just probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Food is good but don't go through the dr the thru you will wait forever  The worst drive thru ever and it's always that way"}
{"text":"OVER PRICED!!  $4.78 for a dry -over cooked egg and cheese croissant... the croissant itself was good but can't justify the price or the quality of the whole sandwich - not going out of my way to come back..."}
{"text":"Been to this location several times and it's always a disappointment. Coffee has always been lukewarm, food comes to you and your party all all different times and lady time we met friends there for evening dessert there was very little choices, the racks were empty. There was one dessert that looked good and we wanted several slices but was told they only will sell that pie whole...really? It's 7:30pm and you won't sell several pieces of pie on the chance someone comes in before closing and wants a whole pie....? They seem to only be able to employ kids there so customer service is below par..."}
{"text":"We used to come here regularly for the turkey club. Today the sandwich came with 2/3rds of the meat missing.  Still hungry.  If they are cutting back this much for a $9 sandwich, I'll be eating elsewhere"}
{"text":"Hmm, not good.  No response, just a blank stare when I finally made it to the order/register after waiting behind some giggly folks that were pointing and talking about the pastries while not really in line.  Should have another way to view the display case so people can browse and not disrupt the flow.  Upon final discovery that the order girl was not deaf mute, I placed an order for french toast.  What I rec'd was certainly different.  It is made like a monkey bread casserole with globs of korintje cinnamon and maybe an egg or two somewhere in the batter.  Far too sweet and oily in some way, not butter, but did not taste lard-based either.  Unable to eat all of it, disappointing.  The dining attendant was personable and had a great smile, that was nice."}
{"text":"I've decided you have to know what to order at Kneaders. Friends rave over the french toast, I think some of the paninis I ordered here in the past turned me off from Kneaders but recently I discovered the croissant sandwiches, and their chicken noodle soup! Service is excellent if you dine in, however I don't think I've ever gone through the drive through without at least one error on an order for 2... so lesson learned, double check your order for accuracy before pulling away from the drive through window!"}
{"text":"I love their fresh bread, specially having a breakfast sandwich with the hazel nut multi grain bread. The service is always good, and a clean environment."}
{"text":"I have celiac disease and am pretty sensitive. I avoided this place for a long time because of the cross contamination fear. I've actually gone now a couple times and I get the turkey bacon avocado salad (swap romaine for spinach) and broccoli soup. They work with me for the swaps I need to stay GF, and their creamy broccoli soup is amazing. They also have a tortilla soup that is GF. It I haven't tried it. People harp on them online for not having GF options...they DO have GF option - just not bread or dessert options. If they offered Gf bread and/or dessert they'd get 5 stars.. ;)   Ps. Cross contamination is still a possible thing here so if you have a life threatening allergy use your head."}
{"text":"Love the paninis. Always use the drive through so can't say much about the service but drive thru is relatively quick."}
{"text":"I am really disappointed in Kneaders.  We frequent this location roughly once per month.  This last week, I ordered an avocado salad at the drive through.  When I brought it home, I found that about half of the lettuce (which was all located at the bottom of the salad) was orange due to being wilted.  The onions had been on the salad for so long that they were dried out and flavorless.  Even the avocados were showing signs of aging.  I completely lost my appetite and threw away my meal.  What a waste!  I attempted to resolve this privately with Kneaders by sending an E-mail to them through their system.  Unfortunately, they never responded so I chose to leave my review here."}
{"text":"Another corporate ripoff with high prices and low value.  Kneaders, Panera, Paradise--nearly identical and not worth your time.  I had the turkey/cranberry on croissant with side salad.  Two slivers of turkey on pathetic croissant and a side salad, which consisted of a few pieces of greens.  I was finished after a few mouthfuls and still hungry.  I could have gotten a real sandwich at Sprouts for half the price and been satisfied."}
{"text":"This is our family's go to spot. Doesn't hurt that they have a drive through either! Haven't tried anything that wasn't delicious! They are not stingy with the meat on their salads, like slot of places seem to be. Oh and the carrot cake is one of the best I've had!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness FANTASTIC bread! If you want any type of bread for sandwiches or today or whatever at home! We had both the Parmesan bread and the cinnamon bread and both were fantastic. Will definitely be going back; unfortunately it is just so far away :( we need one in North Phoenix."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly service, and reasonably fast service despite the long line!"}
{"text":"My family loves coming here! The food and staff are always fantastic! Always welcoming and pretty quick to get us our food. We will keep coming back especially since we found out about the breakfast! My wife absolutely loves the cinnamon crunch French toast! They are huge pieces of French toast with an amazing syrup, whip cream and strawberries. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Finally got around to seeing what the hype was all about, I always hear people talking about this place, and I'm glad I finally got the opportunity to check it out myself! Although I didn't make it in for breakfast, which ends at 11, (and the sourdough pancakes sound amazing) I did get my hands on some delicious portobello artichoke soup! It was so yummy! I would recommend having the rye with it, so yummmm!!!"}
{"text":"The food is still Great... and now it seems like they have worked through most of the timing issues and the register staff now seems to know what they're doing and getting the customers orders processed!!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time in the drive through. Saturday afternoon I waited for 5 minutes to order, no one responded. I had no choice but to stay in line. When I got to the window no one would even come and speak with me. The food is good I will say that much."}
{"text":"Excellent salad and sandwiches. Love the turkey cranberry! Order the half!  Breads are delicious. Pumpkin loaf great. Clean, pretty quick service. Get the Kneader's card cash back. The soup choices and bread bowl is yummy!  Always see cars in the drive through."}
{"text":"This place is very busy but the young people working there are polite.  My wife had the turkey avacado and said it was 5 stars.  Daughter had roast beef and also said 5 stars.  I had the chicken pesto panini and it was not good.  Chicken was barely grilled and didn't cover half of the bread.  It was so soggy it was literally sitting  in a puddle in the container after a short ride home.  Blech.  Desserts are very good."}
{"text":"I'm a drive-thru regular here, which I prefer because the inside dining/waiting experience can be a bit unorganized at times.   All of their soups are seriously delicious, especially the sausage kale. I'm a huge fan of their baked potato and ravioli as well...always hot and you can't go wrong with their fresh baked bread.    I've had most of their desserts over the years and they are equally fantastic, right down to the simple chocolate chip cookie. Delicious!!!  I love kneaders!"}
{"text":"We love Kneader's! Their French toast is literally the best French toast ever. And their breakfast sandwich on a croissant is sooooo yummy. We always have the best service there. Workers are nice and friendly and we get our food quickly. Highly recommend Kneaders! A great place to go to brunch with friends/family. #lfthx"}
{"text":"I absolutely love kneaders! Their staff is always friendly and upbeat; their food is always amazing. My wife and I love to come here and share desserts. Plus their French toast is wonderful, highly recommend! #lfthx"}
{"text":"The food is good but the drive thru service is extremely slow and more often than not, they mess up the order.  Frustrating."}
{"text":"I ordered a Thai salad, fruit tart, and a cinnamon roll. The Thai salad was mediocre. The chicken tasted off and the dressing tasted like thousand island. Same with the cinnamon roll, it was mediocre. On the site they claim they're made fresh, but it tasted stale. The best part was the fruit tart, no complaints about that one."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get those specialty sandwiches or bakery items, and they have incredibly delicious soups. We frequent Kneaders about every two to three weeks. Tonight was one of those \"Arizona chilled to the bone\" kind of nights perfect for some of their soup. Apparently the cashier made a mistake with the order before us because the manager started reprimanding her, in front of us (!!!!), and then proceeded to assume that we were the people who ordered those items on the ticket when we hadn't even been given the chance to speak our order to her yet. She did great handling it though, and didn't seem to let it frazzle her. The food and food service is not why I rated Kneaders a 3-stars however. There was a worker in a red sweater who was helping with gift wrap. I was intrigued by a giant mug but it contained no price. I respectfully asked if she could inform me. She snapped and said \"well, when I'm done I can look it up for you!\" Taken aback, I said OK I will go get me a drink and come back. I came back and she seriously took another 20 minutes to \"gift wrap\" and chat it up with the guest whom she was helping. After five minutes I just sat down and waited. After she finished, I assumed she would come back to answer my question. Nope, new customers. So I approach, said excuse me 3 times and loudly, and she IGNORED ME! I decided if they didn't want to pay me any attention then I didn't want to buy the giant mug and teapot from them. Huge disappointment in this area. If she had just answered me even that last time, I wouldn't have been so frustrated that she took SO long with the first two customers!! It seems overpriced anyway because one teapot was seriously $30. Yah it was adorable, and probably handmade, but  $30???? Don't buy anything but food from them here. That's where their service is anyway."}
{"text":"On my first visit here I found a hair in my salad.  It spoiled it for me forever.  However I must say the salad looked great before I found the hair, and I also tried my friend's French toast which was marvelous. But for me, I don't care how good the food is, if you're dirty I can't come back and never will.  Too bad"}
{"text":"I was glad to hear of a new restaurant coming to Parker CO so I recently tried Kneaders. I have gone 2 times and ordered a sandwich once and a salad the second time. The food is good, but I can't get over all the plastic being used. It is crazy how wasteful this is. They really need to start using dishes for their salads and have utensils that aren't plastic. Can someone explain why they they don't use real dishes?I would rather stick with Panera instead."}
{"text":"First visit today. Kids had ham and cheese sandwich, and we had a french dip, cream of broccoli soup and the raspberry salad. Food was tasty. The sandwich was lacking meat though, very little on it. The salad portion was also small. The pricing is average but small portions. The bread is really good and they give you lots a kinds to choose from.  Ill go again to try the breakfast but not sure Ill spend the money for small portions and small amount of meat on the sandwich.  unique decor, random things for sale"}
{"text":"You would think when you pay almost $20 for two sandwiches that they would actually get the order right and give you what you asked for I'm so glad we didn't have an allergic reaction to whatever it was they gave us."}
{"text":"I've been here probably 15 times. Most of those were in the 1st few months of opening. I've heard they're finding a lot if success here in AZ, making up for not so much success in Utah. I believe there are a few reasons why they cannot hold on to their customers.  Pros: 1. Their breads are amazing, simply the best. We buy their chunky cinnamon bread and make our own French toast. 2. Quality ingredients, everything I've ordered is usually top notch. Cons: 1. My biggest problem is with their sandwiches, theres no meat on them, it's all bread (which is fantastic by the way), but if I wanted their bread I would just order a loaf. If they would just add a few more ounces of meat, comparable to the sandwiches at Paradise I might start ordering them again. The prices for their sandwiches would then be worth the money they charge. I've been tempted to buy several sandwiches and compare with other restaurants, the difference of the quantity of the meat they serve, but haven't done it yet. 2. Slow service, running out of things and hit or miss soups & desserts."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday morning expecting lines and wait, but was pleasantly surprised! I was able to walk right up the counter, order and the food came out quick! This place is awesome and has amazing prices for how much food you get."}
{"text":"First time I went through Kneaders, my cousin and I just grabbed a Cinnamon Roll which was to die for. Today I visited again for lunch, and was shocked. I'm really not a sandwich person, but the half turkey sandwich I got was amazing. The piece was huge, the Kneaders sauce amazing and the prices were cheaper than most. Also, ooey gooey bars; yum!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Took me a while to try Kneader's as my go-to safety blanket has always been Panera, but I'm sure glad I did. Service was very friendly, helpful, and quick. They have a drive through at this location as well to make it even easier. The inside is decorated very farmhouse chic, and it's super clean. The food was so good, and fresh for sure. I ordered the turkey bacon avocado sandwich with a fruit tart- both superior to versions I've had before. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I have loved eating at Kneader's every time we go to Utah now I'm so happy to have them local! My only complaint is that they aren't closer to me.   I went for lunch during the first week they opened, the staff was amazing and helpful and the food was great! My kids both had kids combos, my eldest literally drank every last drop of his chicken noodle soup, I ordered the Chicken Ala Mondo salad and my Mom (1st trip for her) ordered the Turkey Bacon Avocado on Focaccia. We were all impressed, the kids sugar cookies were so good we had to go back and get more.   Next trip there will be for breakfast, can't wait for the french toast!!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich in town.  Veggie avocado add turkey and roast beef. Bread is fresh out the oven."}
{"text":"I am so sad about this Kneaders location. Food was great as always, but the restaurant is disgusting.  Tables weren't cleaned and stuff on the floor. I was there for 30 min and not one employee came out and cleaned tables. The place was empty so there was no excuse.  The sliced limes in the Container at the beverage station will probably make someone sick. The limes were all brown and gross.  The kids working there need to work and quit playing around at the counter when they have no customers. Management needs to take control or they are going to lose business. I won't be back. There is a Kneaders going in by my house and hopefully they will be better. The 2 stars are for the food only..."}
{"text":"This was my first time at kneaders and won't be the last. The glass display made my mouth water and it was so difficult to not order the whole display. We got the pancakes entree and it was delicious. Fast and great service. I can't recommend them enough."}
{"text":"I nine dollar sandwich and they can't get a special request right.   I asked for no sauce or condiments.   She repeated back no sauce?  I confirm no sauce. Drive-through attendant says here's your sandwich with no sauce. My receipt says no sauce. Get home sauce on my sandwich.   However they were very pleasant when I returned the sandwich and they refunded my money"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Most amazing french toast on the planet. Especially since it's all you can eat. Only wish there was an easier way to keep them coming rather then having to wait so long in between each slice."}
{"text":"I've heard so many wonderful things about Kneaders and I finally got around to trying their famous French toast. All I have to say is yum! Thick slices of cinnamon bread with buttermilk syrup, strawberries and whipped cream. I absolutely adore this place! I highly recommend coming to try it ASAP. I know I'll be comming back with friends and family the next chance I get!"}
{"text":"LOVE the food there.  The citrus chicken salad is one of my favs, but so far haven't been disappointed with anything I've tried!  The breads are phenominal, the soups are great, and they have a caffeine free diet drink on the list which is great.  The double fudge brownie is incredible too! I do miss Paradise Bakery since they give you a cookie with the meal...but I keep going back to Kneaders - there's just something about them :)  I want to try the breakfast, but have yet to do so."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now. I'd say it's a winner for breakfast and pastries but not so much for anything else. I've had the crossiant breakfast sandwiches which are delicious, fresh, and warm and fairly large. For about $6 not a bad deal as it also comes with a side of fresh fruit. I've also had the French toast that everyone raves about. It's good. I wouldn't say the BEST, but it's good for a chain. Now for lunch, I've had a couple of the turkey sandwiches. The plus is I do like the fact it's fresh shredded turkey rather than deli meat. But to me the sandwiches they seemed dry like they were missing something. Aside from that overpriced!! You can easily spend $15+ for a sandwich a small side salad and a drink. I also had their bread pudding which was AWESOME so they seem excel in the baking area. For lunch I would much rather frequent wildflower or paradise bakery alike. Their one up is that they have a convenient drive thru!! What?! bread pudding on the go??!!"}
{"text":"This is right next to the surgery center - so the location is ideal. I had the Mediterranean omelet and ordered in the drive thru. Omelet lacked lots of veggies was kind of a \"sprinkle\". I do like the fact that you get toast and orange slices though. Everything is packed in a large plastic box, so the heat from my omelet made my \"toast\" soggy, and my orange slices were placed on top of my toast. A bakery sleeve would fix this issue (and make this a four star review)."}
{"text":"They call themselves a bakery and they close at 10pm. But they ran out of cinnamon rolls at noon and won't be making anymore. Bummer"}
{"text":"This place is always busy at lunch hour! If you have only an hour lunch, then it wouldn't be a good idea to go. The line and wait is not as long if you go before noon.  Customer service experience was good. Friendly people and clean place.  I love getting their croissant sandwiches for lunch. Comes with a small side of salad or soup. Their breakfast is very tasty! French Toast is a must try! They have this honey maple syrup that goes well with it!"}
{"text":"LOVE Kneaders food, ambience, gifts....everything!!! Friendly to families, couples, groups and singles. Make sure to take something sweet home for later!!!"}
{"text":"They used to pack a ton of meat on their sandwiches. Now there is hardly any. I still like their desserts and French toast."}
{"text":"Well I tried kneaders again today but wish I  didn't I bought a 7.99 chicken chop salad.  It had about 7 small pieces of chicken, cucumbers, ( that tasted like they had been in the fridge to long) 4 grape tomatoes, 4 rings of onion.  Sprinkled with blue cheese.   Just a so so salad.  The problem I have is I got it to go on my lunch break.  I start eating and find that the lettuce didn't look washed.  There was mud still on the leaves.   See picture.  So I wasted my money and my time for the last time."}
{"text":"I had a feeling Kneader's might be bad since the other Utah-based chains that have come to town haven't been that good (I'm looking at you, Cafe Rio and Cafe Zupas), but Kneader's shows them who's boss of mediocrity!  They have one vegetarian sandwich (not including the grilled cheese), and the veggies are cooked in aus jus!!! Seriously! I'm appalled as a vegetarian, and as someone who enjoys the privilege of the sense of taste, I am disgusted by what I ate. I had my husband try it as well to make sure my taste buds weren't off after abstaining from meat the past few years, but he agreed the aus jus taste was accurate.  My husband's sandwich was also bad. His skimpy reuben had roast beef in it, not pastrami. I just couldn't believe my eyes. The parmesan chips were just regular chips covered in Kraft granulated fakey parmesan that didn't even stick. Very overpriced at $8.50 each. To quote Woody Allen, the food was terrible-- and such small portions!"}
{"text":"I have driven past this place so many times but never had I stopped in. I was nearby Saturday so I finally made it in for some food!   It was 9:30am and it was pretty busy. We stood in line behind two other groups and so we had more then enough time to look over the menu.   The people ahead of us were having some issues ordering, so we were finally helped by another employee who had seen we had been standing there for a while.  We decided to order a turkey bacon and avocado sandwich with a cup of the broccoli cheddar soup ($8.99) and a Southwest bbq chicken salad for $5.99 (a small salad) and one regular drink for $20.   The food?! Wow!!!! So good. My sandwich was amazing! The bread was so fluffy and spongey! My broccoli soup was great, I wish I would've ordered a bigger size. The salad was mind blowing! The dressing and everything mixed together was such a great concoction! We want more!   There are plenty of tables inside and outside as well with shade! They also have bigger tables for big groups inside.   The inside decor is so cute and they also sell little gifts and home decor, but it can be a tad bit too pricey.. the drive thru was crazy busy the whole time we were there..  Customer service could definitely improve. They were not having it on this day... grumpy, unfriendly, and looking miserable.. :(  5 stars for the great tasting food but down to three stars because the employees could do better."}
{"text":"I have never had anything bad here! Whether you're looking for baked goods, a meal or even just a cup of coffee this is where it's at! My favorite is the apple bread pudding! I can't get enough of it!"}
{"text":"I went to Kneaders on Baseline in Gilbert today. After a lackluster French dip with lukewarm bullion I went to order dessert. I decided on the carrot cake. The frosting was rock hard. I brought it to the managers attention. He went to check the other 2 on display and the same. He said, I'll get some from the back. He came back and said, \"these are fresh from the freezer\"......uhhh come again....fresh from the freezer??? That's not fresh. When I asked he said they were made the day before, and the frosting was.....you guessed it, hard!! I can go to the Safeway bakery next door and get a dessert made that day with soft frosting. I've tried this place on a few different occasions and I'm done. It's absolutely nothing special."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but I've been there a few times now and I've ordered the turkey bacon sandwich. What I didn't know is that I was ordering a vegetarian sandwich. There is hardly any turkey or bacon in the sandwich. I know there's overhead, but come on. You need to check the ration of your serving Kneader's. Not cool."}
{"text":"I picked up some soup and sandwiches through the drive thru and was SO disappointed. The soup was so watered down it was disgusting and the sandwiches had such small amounts of ingredients they were not worth the price. Huge disappointment. We stopped eating at Zumas Cafe for the same reason. Bummer : ("}
{"text":"I love Kneader's. Sometimes it takes a long time, but it's worth it. I always get the Tuna Sandwich on Hazelnut Bread -it's the best :)"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. Drive thru for a simple loaf of bread and they can not get that right. They askec three times if wanted bread sliced and loudly said no three times. Bread sliced and when i go into to get what i ordered not so much as a sorry from supposed\" manager\". Rather go to a business that puts some effort into customer service."}
{"text":"Slowest drive through ever!!!! This is not fast food folks, this is slow as molasses service. Also, they put raisins or pineapple or something gross in their pasta salad.. who thought of that.. yuck! Also chicken salad should only be chicken,  mayo, celery, and maybe grapes.. No need for apples or pineapple or whatever fruit you decide to throw in there. Also, please keep the hair out of the salads. Yuck!!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast with husband there for the first and last time.  Confusing when you enter the front door and no one to help you figure out the route.  My French toast was served stone cold, the fruit cup was mediocre, and my husband had to go up to the counter to get the rest of his order.  It was sitting on the counter and was, of course, cold.  Very very noisy with kids running around the place, kids screaming, and wait staff walking around calling out peoples names..  Not a very friendly place to eat.  All you get with the meal is the entre, everything else is ala carte including coffee and juice.  Quite expensive for what we got.  I would not go back there again.  I had high hopes for this place but a big disappointment.  Save your money."}
{"text":"While I love the idea of getting a fresh salad and a fresh loaf of sourdough all in a drive-thru, I am not excited about the last and only 2 experienced I've had. I ordered a turkey bacon avocado salad, and TWICE I brought it home and there was no bacon! Not a big deal, I know, but if it happens to me twice,  it's an issue. I wouldve loved to resolve it by calling the restaurant to let them know their bacon was missing!  But I called 4 times, and it rang and rang for minutes, at 4pm!  All I can say is, don't deprive a woman of her bacon!"}
{"text":"Ordered in the drive Thru and got the chicken pesto sandwich. It was my first time so I didn't realize they put a pickle in the container with your sandwich. Basically, when I got home my sandwich smelled and tasted like a pickle. I hate pickles :( the sandwich wasn't that great to begin with but that was a real bummer! Overall, it was just okay."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, very pleasant atmosphere! The food tastes very good as well! It is similar to other bakery sandwich brands. They have a small area for Knick nacks that my girlfriend loved. My only complaint is the bread on my chibatta ish bread was so thick it made the sandwich taste dry. I can see us coming back because the soup was great."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quick, order at the counter, yet amazing breakfast joint, this really is it. My husband and I come here at least twice a month just for their $5 all you can eat french toast, and their (almost) equally yummy pancakes. Be prepared for a long line if you arrive close to 11am, which is when breakfast ends and lunch begins. Sometimes on weekends it is really hard to find a table, and it is an open seating style restaurant. If you happen to stop by for lunch, the chicken salad on a croissant is really good, and their bakery pies and treats are always freshly made. My husband usually gets the BLT but I thought it was pretty boring and bland compared to other comparable bakery sandwiches.  Note that they are closed on Sundays, which is disappointing because it's my favorite day to roll out of bed for a late breakfast."}
{"text":"I love this place! The cinnamon French toast is my favorite! The slices of bread are huge and it comes with strawberries and cream and delicious syrup.  I had a sandwich once and it was good but I typically just come for breakfast. If you come on the weekend or a holiday be prepared for a crowd.  I came on a holiday and there were long lines and I had to wait for a table. It was worth the wait! Delicious food and great prices! Another thing I love about this place is the awesome decorations you can buy.  I always stop to check out what new fun seasonal things they have."}
{"text":"This place is on par with every other sandwich chain like it. I still prefer Wildflower Bread Co, but this is a good place to see the real housewives of Gilbert during the week."}
{"text":"Went there to try my 1st sandwich today....Chicken pesto panini....it was soggy and ok tasting.  I was really hoping for crunchy bread....Then the chips...Soggy tasting.  I did not try the many desserts they have but they looked good.  However, for over $10 (with an iced green tea which is good) not worth the money.  I could have purchased a sub at Subway with more flavor and for 1/2 the money"}
{"text":"Kneader's has been on my radar for awhile, and today was the day I finally got to experience it for myself.  My understanding is that it is based in Utah and is somehow affiliated with the Mormon church, which is all I needed to know; I'm not Mormon, but some of my best friends are and I trust their \"brand'.  Basically, if it has to do with food and Mormons are involved, I'm there!   So today I met my (Mormon) friend at Kneader's for lunch.  Here's the problem:  I had my wisdom teeth extracted less than a week ago, and today is day two of trying to eat solid foods.  Because of this, I order the soup and sandwich combo, and got a chicken salad sandwich which comes on a big, beautiful, fresh croissant; otherwise I never, ever would have ordered chicken salad (boring! bland!) when there are so many amazing choices.   Much to my surprise, this was THE tastiest chicken salad sandwich I have had in my LIFE.  Honestly.  The turkey dumpling soup was also delish and tasted homemade.  It also came with a little side salad, but my jaw was not up to trying to deal with that.    I could go on and on, but I have a large selection of assorted pastries on my kitchen counter to sample.  So far, I can tell you the chocolate dome cake is moist and extremely chocolatey and meant to be shared, and the eclair is top notch filled with plenty of creamy, not-tasting-like-it-was-from-a-powder-mix, custard. I will be back, with my friends and family in tow.  You should go, too, and you don't even need a Mormon friend to get in."}
{"text":"I feel like I could write essays about Kneaders with the number of times I've been here (both in Utah and Arizona) but I'll try to keep it concise.   If you come here for breakfast, get the french toast. Also, be prepared to consume a ton of calories. They make their french toast on a chunky cinnamon bread which is essentially cinnamon roll bread - frosting and all - and then top it with strawberries, cream, and a homemade syrup. And it's amazing. You'll love every bite, and regret it afterwards. I wouldn't know about their other breakfast dishes (there are few) because this one is so good I've never felt the need to try anything else. You can buy the chunky cinnamon bread in loaves as well, but I kind of think that adds insult to injury so I've personally never bothered taking a loaf home.  For lunch there's a few things I love most, but I've come with a variety of people and everyone orders something different. As far as I know, no one has been disappointed by what they've tried. I personally love the turkey and artichoke panini on the asiago cheese bread. This is one of the only places I'll get artichoke on something, and that combined with the sauce they use on it and the bread itself is just superb. They have a huge variety of breads to choose from (this is a bakery after all) and all the ones I've had so far have been great, though my favorites are the asiago cheese and the country sourdough. Recently they also started serving a southwest bbq chicken salad which is my new favorite item. The chicken is always cooked perfectly and again, their sauces are fantastic.   If you still have room, they have a plethora of different pastries and other goodies you can get after your meal. In the fall they have pumpkin chocolate chip cookies, which are a must buy. The rest of the year I really love their sugar cookies and cream cheese brownies. Yum!  The service can be a little slow but overall it's a fantastic place I'm sure I'll frequent for years to come."}
{"text":"Ohmygoodness, such delicious food and baked goods!! Every time I go there, the workers are polite and attentive, and they've yet to get my order wrong, even when I've gone through the drive through numerous times (it happens all too often haha). And mine is a complicated order!! I love love love their turkey bacon avocado sandwich, but I get it on sour dough bread instead, and I always ask for an extra sauce on the side as well. And, I have to order a cream cheese brownie with my delicious sammie, because it is also to die for. I've also tried their caramel apples, pumpkin breads, cinnamon rolls, eclairs, cookies, and cannolis, and I've yet to eat anything of theirs that wasn't absolutely delicious! And their workers are seriously so kind, a friend of mine had a Kneader's kick one month and went like 6 times in 4 weeks haha, and when we returned a couple months later, they recognized us and told us they hadn't seen us in a while- too funny. :) And there's also always a bunch of boutique items (a lot of home decor, some jewelry, a ribbon section) for sale as well. It gives Kneadwer's a very fun vibe. I personally never buy any of that, because I'm a poor college student, but it's great to look for ideas there- I would pin almost all of those boutique items to my Pinterest boards if I saw pictures of them online haha. Overall, such a fun and delish sandwich and baked goods restaurant!!! Would (and do!) recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"I love their breakfast foods. I am a drive thru fanatic, so I love that I can pick up quickly. I have been here about 6 times and 2 times they messed up my order, which bites, because they aren't cheap. But when they do get it right, it's awesome."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE NEEDS TO CLOSE! We sat in the drive-thru for THIRTY minutes. If you can't handle a drive thru, CLOSE IT! Completely horrible waste of thirty minutes of my life. I will never go here again. I am shocked they are even in business. Food was mediocre."}
{"text":"I wish I could love Kneaders!  It was good when they first opened. That's are often out of soups. Today we order two panini artichoke turkey sandwiches. My thought 'yuck' paninis are supposed to have a bit of crispness. Not be soggy!  Yup totally soggy. We also ordered two of the Cheese sandwiches. Hmmm you are supposed to melt the cheese. I am pretty sad that this bakery is really lame and lacking in customer service:("}
{"text":"This place NEVER gets my order right. Not only does the line take way too long but they can never seem to get my order right any time I go. It's so frustrating . This place isn't cheap so when you're paying 10 dollars a salad you would hope they get it right! They can't even get the kids meals right. It's kind of a joke really. Not sure if it's the management or what but it's a shame because the food is actually decent. Definitely not the quality of the originals in Utah but hopefully they figure it out soon here."}
{"text":"This review has nothing to do with their food, for us, it has been pretty consistently what it intends to be. This is about their online ordering system. I've ordered both times ahead of time (first time 30 minutes, second 1 and half hours) and the order had not been started when I arrived both times at the pickup time. The first time, they started making it when I pointed out their error and got it amount 10 minutes later. However, the second time, I told two different employees a few minutes apart that I had ordered online and they both confirmed that they had received it and were working on it. 30 minutes later, after seeing 2 customers who walked into the store and ordered their food get it before mine, I complained to a different employee and had to wait another 10 minutes before getting my food. Moral of the story: DON'T USE THEIR ONLINE ORDERING SYSTEM. In addition, I sent a private complaint to the manager by email after the second issue, since I don't think it's necessary or fair to report every mistake a business makes on Yelp, but I have not heard back at all. That's why I am reporting it here."}
{"text":"I love kneaders because their employees are so polite. This location was no exception. We got a smoothie and a croissant sandwich and both were delicious! We love morning sunshine and strawberry tsunami smoothies. The best part is they are really thick! I've always loved their French toast but pretty much everything I've tried has been great."}
{"text":"Food was okay, nothing spectacular, wish they were more friendly as the girl taking the order was rushing both myself and girlfriend. Place was clean and looked good just tye friendliness part that got me and rubbed us the wrong way"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying when they get the order right, their food is excellent! With that being said 9/10 times the order is wrong! We live about 1 miles from this location, we used to stop on our way home from work and pick up salads to-go. EVERY time there is something wrong. We are NOT picky eaters and usually only ask them to hold the onions, but there is always something wrong with the order. They forget the dressing, give you the wrong dressing, forget a various item on the salad (cheese, chicken, nuts, etc), forget the bread that each salad comes with.  We've complained to the evening manager on 3 separate occasions, for no other reason but to help correct the issues. However, we went back again about 2 weeks ago and BAM, same thing!!   Goodbye Kneaders, sad to see you go, especially since our entire neighborhood was excited for your opening, but you just couldn't get it right!!!!"}
{"text":"We love Kneader's! We go to this one most often but we've been to San Tan and even some of the Kneader's in Utah.   Sorry to say this one dissapoints too often. They are often out of many items on the menu and have never offered a discount for substitutions--after the third time, I asked. Nope. On Wed I was told they were out of mint brownies but yesterday, the girl told us they don't offer mint brownies anymore. :(  The worst part about this Kneader's? A few weeks back, my mom said she got sick and I thought it was an isolated incident. About a week later, i felt sick after ordering a salad. Last night, both my husband and I felt ill from our sandwiches. I think I'm done with this location. I'll make the drive to San Tan."}
{"text":"Pretty good soups and great croissant breakfast sandwiches. Can be a bit pricey, but comparable to Panera or Paradise bakery café. When being served by mature people and not the young people I feel that service is much better.. They can be a bit attitudey. I do frequent here at least once a week even though it is a little bit pricey, but the bread is so fresh and good! If you have a particular loaf in mind I would get to them ASAP in the morning since they go quickly."}
{"text":"I got the Ruben. Not bad but not great. I would go back but only if I was in the area.  I would drive back for their pastries."}
{"text":"Thought I'd give this place another chance and wish I wouldn't have.  Once again bad service and the food is terrible.  It was dinner time only 4 tables with customers yet there were dirty tables, out of napkins and just dirty.  WILL NOT go back."}
{"text":"I wanna hate this place, I really do.  From the sappy tired \"farmhouse\" decor on the inside with wall to wall oak to the hoard of \"east valleyites\" who talked about this place for months before it opened.  I was sure this place was all misplaced hype.    That was until I tried the turkey bacon avocado on their baguette bread.  Hands down best turkey sandwich in town.    Their soups are average at best which negates a fifth star.  But that sandwich, oh that sandwich."}
{"text":"I cannot begin to say how kind and helpful the employees are. Shontel, a manager, was so kind when a mistake was made with my purchase. Besides the food being in a class all of its own, the people make the difference."}
{"text":"So disappointed! I have been to several Kneaders in east county and was so impressed we invited friends to come with us tonight. This location did not live up to expectations. Both my husband's sandwich and my salad had so little meat I wasn't sure they actually put any in them. Very little avacado as well. My husband said the bathroom was disgusting. Embarrassed to have brought friends to this location. We will not go back when there are much better locations like Signal Butte and San Tan Village. The only reason I gave three stars because Elijah was great."}
{"text":"Love the food here as far as soups and sandwiches. Bakery looks better than it tastes. Sitting here right now waiting for breakfast. No coffee at the self serve. Asked and waited.  5 minutes later asked again. Was told by the woman doing specialty coffees she didn't have time. What kind of service is that?!  Dirty filthy tables. To be fair, have never experienced this at lunch. Don't bother at breakfast.  Update:  food came. Both egg sandwiches cold.   Not even warm. COLD. Update 2:  new sandwich. Still cold. And they put it on a grilled and burnt croissant. Such a ways of time and money."}
{"text":"Try the french toast. It's amazing. The pieces are probably 2 inches thick and the size of salad plates. I could barely finish one piece. If you can finish it, I'll be incredibly impressed.  4 stars because of price, but otherwise, very nice little place!"}
{"text":"I ordered the French dip. Great portion and perfect taste. Will definitely order this again!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I always get a bowl of soup.  The soup has never disappointed, but I would like to try a salad or sandwich too, however at Kneaders you can only get a combo like that if you get a soda with it. I don't like soda.  Anyway if you want a good bowl of soup, this is your place."}
{"text":"Seriously. At this time and age how are people still messing up orders. I come here and pay almost $25 for two SIMPLE sandwiches.  Edit: after the third mess up I decided to call in to express my concerns. They were very quick to try to resolve the issue and even offered free meals. I'll give them that"}
{"text":"This place is pretty much the same exact thing as paradise bakery but better quality... Wildflower is a different style and definitely my favorite for a restaurant style sandwhich but this place was good too!   Ordered: Turkey bacon avocado on Crossaint  A little pricey for 10$, w/ no drink.   The turkey was my favorite part... so yummy!"}
{"text":"Went here as a family for dinner.  Looked really nice on the inside. The line wasn't super long but it took awhile to get our order in. I would suggest more than 1 person on the cash register. Also every time we asked for something she would go and check to see if they had it.   We got our food pretty quick after. The selection wasn't that great food wise, but awesome pastry wise. I give it a 2 for food and time it took and a 4 for dessert. Pretty expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"First visit... Ordered a salad but got home with a sandwich. The bread looked amazing, but I don't eat bread so I tossed it and added lettuce to the stuff and it was quite tasty! They must have salads and sandwiches with the same name!?"}
{"text":"The French toast was amazing and most of the foods are, but it's unacceptable to wait AN HOUR for 2 smoothies and French toast.. I've seen busier restaurants with better service.."}
{"text":"I've tried to like kneaders because everyone talks about it like crazy, but every single time I go I leave unsatisfied and I tell myself I won't come back. The first time I went I found a hair in my sandwich. I understand that things like that happen all the time, but it turned me off. Another time I went I ordered a sandwich and the bread was torn in half making it very difficult to eat. I am just not satisfied with the customer service either. When I have a problem with my meal I feel as though I am a nuisance. I shouldn't feel like that at a restaurant. I will not be going back to kneaders."}
{"text":"Kneaders is one of our favorite places to eat! We love everything from the breakfast, lunch & dinner menus!! We are huge fans of the French toast ! It's so good & unlimited! Great staff & super clean as well! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Typically great food. However all the soups and no crackers? What a joke! I asked an employee who could of cared less. Lame."}
{"text":"It is a shame that this place is so badly run . Sandwiches and Bread are very good, but everything is so scattered. Orders are always wrong, and things are always out of stock.  The last three times I went, they were out of most breads. Today was the fourth time I went and they were out of all breads except Rye.  The last two times our orders were made incorrectly.  I'm done."}
{"text":"This place, and Cafe Rio, perfectly embody Utah's contribution to the culinary world. The formula is simple.  Attractive price point+family friendly atmosphere+casual dining+mounds of calories+super generous portions = a decent week day option."}
{"text":"I love this place! Have gone drive through a couple times, the first time they left out half my order but I was happy to park and go in and see their desserts! Today I met a friend for lunch there at 11:30, we beat the rush! I had a club sandwich and chocolate chunk cookie....delicious!!"}
{"text":"I've only ever ordered take out or from the drive-thru so this review is solely on the food. I often get their banana walnut oatmeal along with an Americano or soy latte, and it always starts my day out in the best way. The oatmeal texture is perfect, with toppings that are always fresh.   For lunch, my favorite item is the tuna sandwich. Tuna has never been happier than on a simple bed of lettuce and hazelnut bread (yes, you read that right!). No tomatoes, pickles, or fancy fix-ins. None necessary. I never knew how much I needed hazelnut in my sandwich bread until now. It's truly life changing.   If you've had a long day or just want to treat yo self for getting out of bed this morning, get any one of their mouthwatering pastries. I'm salivating thinking about their chocolate croissants. YUM."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful breakfast at Kneaders! Once again their customer service was great and the wait time was very minimal! I ordered the chunky cinnamon French toast and it did not disappoint!!"}
{"text":"Getting better all the time.  Caffeine free diet coke because it's Mormon owned.   Not open on Sunday.  Clean.  Great service.   Good cookies."}
{"text":"I love the breakfast more than anything. The portions are huge and the coffee is delicious. Order the French toast and make sure you get extra strawberries and whipped cream!!  Very kid friendly."}
{"text":"Kneaders is simply fantastic!  I love Paradise Bakery and I can say very confidently that Kneaders is even better.  From the sandwiches, soup and salad to their mouth watering desserts.  It is impossible to not be delighted with everything on the menu here.  The employees are always friendly and the service is quick as well.  I also liked that the condiment area is always full and the restaurant has always been very clean when we've gone there.  A new favorite for my family.  The only thing I do not like is that they're closed on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Delicious as always! My husband and I were sad going keto that we counldnt get anything here but their salads are AMAZING!"}
{"text":"The bread, the desserts, and baked goods are awesome; reason enough to go back again and again.  Whenever we go, we bring a sliced loaf of asiago cheese bread home.   Sandwiches are good, but pricey.  Everything seems a bit pricey, but it really is quality food.  The staff is great, everyone is nice and helpful.  The wife really loves their smoothies, and that's a good thing!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on a Saturday, the place was packed, not enough seats, and the few table that were open were dirty.  Had the french toast as everyone goes on and on about it, however I thought it to be just ok.  It is about 2 inches thick which makes the middle very dry.  Two others in my party had breakfast sandwiches which were loaded (dripping) with butter/oil.  The prices are reasonable, it was only about $22 for 3 of us.  Not that this is the resturants fault, but parents were letting their children run loose, they were standing in the windows, crawling on the floor, leaning over booths and screaming at other customers.  We did buy a loaf of blueberry/lemon bread that was delicious.  Sorry, but I will not go back here."}
{"text":"Their stuffed french toast is the best I have EVER had! But the service was only mediocre. Their smoothies are DELISH but slightly over priced for the small size. I like that they have a drive thru, since the inside line is always long. I would go again, but maybe before the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Slowest drive thru in the entire valley. Expect to wait at least 15-20 minutes in the drive thru or inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"I purchased two salads to serve with Stromboli..both were wilted, orange (old)..threw them away"}
{"text":"Always yummy. I usually go for breakfast because the French toast is to die for but I went for lunch, I got the turkey bacon avocado and it was SOOooooooo good!"}
{"text":"On a rare rainy day, I entered the restaurant craving some soup and a sandwich. I could have gone through the drive thru but since this was my first time, I wanted to go inside and get the full experience. At the entrance, cute home décor items were displayed for sale. A fire was roaring in the middle of the restaurant and felt very cozy inside. Before ordering, the pastry display is right there with all these beautiful desserts staring at you screaming \"eat me!\". Oh I will, don't you worry!  There wasn't a line when I came in but then again it was around 3:30pm on a rainy day. Samples of their bread were available on the counter, in which I grabbed a slice of the asiago cheese bread. So good! I then asked the cashier for recommendations and he said the turkey, bacon and avocado sandwich was the best seller. I ordered it as a whole sandwich, a cup of corn chowder and a couple desserts (a mint chocolate brownie and a chocolate mousse dessert). All this and a beverage for $15, not pricey at all. If we are comparing it to paradise bakery, as many of the other reviews do, this is WAY cheaper!   I wait a few minutes for my food to-go and continued to look around at the items for sale. I waited maybe 5 minutes and everything was ready to go. The sandwich was HUGE and looked so yummy. I couldn't wait to get home and eat. When I got home, I zapped the soup for 30 seconds just to heat it up again. The corn chowder was very good, it had sweet corn which gave it a sweet yet savory flavor. The sandwich was amazing...the focaccia bread was so soft and amazing! The sandwich contents kept falling out but still a great sandwich and was very filling. I actually had to wait many hours before trying the desserts.   The mint chocolate brownie was incredible! I also got the chocolate mousse dessert, which was good but not as good as the brownie. They have lots of other desserts to choose from as well and am excited to come back and try more!  I have absolutely nothing bad to say about Kneader's. I am so excited this is not too far away from me and cheaper than other bakeries. I can't say this place really compares to Paradise Bakery anyways, the food and variety of desserts and concept are very different. Would totally recommend and will be back!!"}
{"text":"Lovely salads and sandwiches!  The bread and desserts are to die for.  Not much atmosphere, but at least there is not loud music playing and you can actually visit with one another."}
{"text":"Baked goods are great but skip the coffee. We went there on a Saturday at 7:30 and ordered a pumpkin muffin, a chocolate chip scone and a cinnamon roll. Also took a loaf of zucchini bread to go. 2 coffees. The coffees were tasteless so let's move onto the good stuff - all the baked goods were amazing. The cinnamon roll in particular was delicious and the zucchini bread was full of flavor but not greasy. My only real complaint is that it looked as if none of the tables had been wiped down before they opened. Since they'd just opened 30 minutes before we arrived, and we were the only ones there at 7:30, it seemed the tables were dirty from the night before. Yuck - clean it up Kneaders!"}
{"text":"I ordered a catering order for breakfast for 20 people.  The person that helped me was named Angel and her recommendations were great.  The French Toast was great and had the butter and syrup on the side so they would stay warm and delicious.  I also ordered oatmeal which had the toppings on the side so people could decide what they want. Everything was done very well and the catering order worked out perfectly."}
{"text":"Don't order online. I made the mistake thinking it would save me time but I showed up when at the pickup time it showed online which was about 25 mins from the time of order and then sat over 15 mins longer in the dinning area because it seemed no one had even started on my order. If I hadn't of paid online I would've walked out. And then when I spoke to the manager on the phone after I left she just told me she would address it with the staff and was not very apologetic at all. I've enjoyed driving through this place many times but I wont be fooled again."}
{"text":"I have to agree with some of the other posts about this location. Maybe it's due to this location being so new and trying to get the employees up to speed. Definitely do not recommend going on a Saturday or Sunday when the weekend crew is working. Salads are lacking the chicken. I have had times where you can count two or three small prices of chicken on a $7 dollar salad. My chicken Alamondo today was a little interesting, seemed like it came out of the freezer two minutes before hitting the table.   Bakery items are usually amazing. Free samples up front by the register are always nice. I love this place, but this particular store has some work to do. Hopefully the owners and management reads some of the reviews."}
{"text":"Was very very disappointed our last trip. It has been several months since we have visited as the prices are a bit too high for what you get & the wait is very long. We ordered 2 samdwiches which took over 15 minites to get & were put together very poorly. The country french bread was airy with lots of holes & they still used it for our sandwiches. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Wife was sick and wanted some soup. We had the cheese and broccoli and it was great. A lot cheaper than Paradise and just as good."}
{"text":"First time at this kneaders. They were pretty busy for a Friday morning. Called in my order at 8 am for an 8:45 pick up and it was ready on time. Staff was kind and courteous."}
{"text":"We love Kneaders! We visited for lunch today and had the turkey bacon avocado sandwich and the cauliflower soup. Everything tasted so fresh and delicious. I also thought the staff was very friendly. We had a question about their soup and they offered us a sample. The customer service was great! We will be back."}
{"text":"Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwich is massive and delicious!  I saved the second half for dinner and sandwich tasted just as good as it did at lunch. I love that they have a drive thru!  As always service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This location was close by and my hardworkin' hubby was stuck at his computer and I tried the drive through a couple times when he couldn't stop to munch.  The first was a breakfast croissant with egg, sausage, and cheese.  It was huge and really looked handmade, as compared to the kind of croissants you find at other places.  The second visit I ordered the Roast Beef Cafe Sandwich and he wasn't disappointed with that one either.  ;) I used the drive through both times and found it was quick and easy to order from. (My wait was probably less than 5-6 minutes and I wasn't first in line either time)  Since I'd never experienced Kneaders before, it was great to be pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food.  Its menu kind of reminds me of another popular chain, but the two sandwiches were better than theirs...  I'd definitely not hesitate to visit this location again, from the other reviews, sounds like the french toast is pretty good!"}
{"text":"Not ONCE has this location got my order correct. Ever since they opened. Every time they screw it up. It's become a joke. Foods good though so I just double check before I drive off."}
{"text":"Always good food at Kneaders! Just be careful going at night because your favorite soup might be out! I love getting the fruit tarts and cream of broccoli soup. I have had their salads and they are amazing as well. They don't even need dressing! Just one of those places where everything on the menu is great!"}
{"text":"This place will be my new favorite place! Their food is delicious! I ordered a combo #3 for the cranberry turkey sandwich. It included a drink, chips, salad, and also a pastry/dessert for under 10 dollars! The sandwich and the dessert was great. This place is also very cute and nicely decorated. When I went there it was clean and very nice. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Carb loading?  If you're answer is yes, come to Kneaders. They specialize in baked goods, so that's the bulk of the menu. I did find an egg white omelet, so I escaped the clutches of the fantastic French toast! You can add bacon too, which is a plus.  The bread (and thus the French toast) are amazing. A bit too sweet...like a dessert.   The restaurant itself is a bit cluttered with gifts and crafty stuff.  This can make it difficult to maneuver if it's the least bit busy, since you order and pick up at the counter, then seat yourself.  I would come here again, but would definitely have to bank my available calories beforehand!"}
{"text":"The hands down slowest drive thru window in the known universe. Employees move at the speed of frozen syrup."}
{"text":"Cruised through the drive thru a little after noon on a Friday.  Line, while busy - moved rather quickly, I ordered an avocado salad and Mr. Pibb.  Salad was delicious. I'm a no frills kind person, so lettuce, onion, cucumber, and croutons does it for me. Ranch was perfect.  Paid just over $10.  4 stars as it was kiiiinda pricey for a salad and a drink."}
{"text":"Kneaders is the all around place for a bite to eat. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner and you can't go wrong with all of them! On my first visit (and second and third and fourth) I tried the different sandwiches---I mean it's a bakery---the bread has to be good. I WAS RIGHT. I went through a healthy phase and dabbled in the salads-without fail. SO AMAZING and fresh! Just this AM tried the breakfast---CHUNKY CINNAMON FRENCH TOAST. Okay stop stop stop! The homemade Carmel sauce is just all you need to know. Try it. Try it. TRY IT!!!"}
{"text":"The raspberry cheesecake tarts are out of this world!  I found these guys at the Original Taste event in Scottsdale where I was able to sample a variety of their products and simply fell in love.  They have some of the most delicious breads and pastries that I have ever tasted from any patisserie or bakery.  The staff went out of their way in kindness to myself and my friends and made us all feel very special.  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I love this place! High quality lunch and breakfast through a drive thru! Love the French toast and the salads and also the turkey avocado sandwich.  So far so good.  FAST TOO :)"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and polite, service was prompt and the food wasn't bad but not great. The only complaint I have is that the dinning area was filthy while the staff stood around chatting.   This was my first dinning experience at Kneaders, I went to Kneaders because a friend spoke highly of the food and service. I don't care how good the food is I won't  sit in the previous diner's mess."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. I ordered dessert that was in the case, sat and waited for 15 minutes and then they said they sold my items to the drive thru and gave it to them instead and it was the last ones. I won't waste my time or money at this business again."}
{"text":"We had read a few of the feedbacks before going here.   I have eat at Kneaders in Utah several times and love the place but after reading some of the negatives on here I was wondering if this location maybe had some issues.  My wife and I decided we would give it a try and make our own decision.  I am glad we did.  The service was speedy, they were very helpful and the food was delicious.  The place was rather busy and the staff seemed to handle the crowd with no problems.  Superb sandwiches, and delectable Deserts.  I can't wait to come back for the French Toast Breakfast :-)"}
{"text":"This Kneaders is excellent. No matter how busy they are the employees are always on their A-game. We were treated with respect quickly and the breakfast food was delicious."}
{"text":"I have visited kneaders 3 times in the past few weeks and in each endeavor had to-go orders. Would love to comment on how the quality of good they serve is top notch however after repeated incorrect orders I have refused to eat here. Seems to me this is a direct lack of management having their 15-18 year old hourly employees take as much care for what I order as what a public teacher lectures. 3 strikes and you're out with me and I'll be continuing to take my business to Panera and Paradise Bakery."}
{"text":"We enjoyed dinner tonight! Very clean, food was delicious and came our fast, and customer service was top notch! We eat here all the time and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches, wonderful soups, and didn't take very long in the drive-thru like everyone else was complaining about in other reviews."}
{"text":"Focaccia Turkey Artichoke Panini with Parmesan chips and a pickle..so good. I just love Kneaders. What's so cool is they always have samples because I'm so hungry when I go there. They are so nice there too. I'm glad they are popping up in AZ."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time around noon on a Saturday - I was pleasantly surprised that there was no line and the service was very quick!   The food was delicious. I ordered the chicken pesto panini, which came with fresh potato chips and a pickle slice. I also ordered two slices of the tres leches cake to go ( a big hit at home!).   I plan to stop by earlier next time and try the breakfast menu, which I've heard great things about, too.   #lfthx"}
{"text":"Every time I go here I order hot food and they always serve it cold. I think the food looks nice there but actually it tastes like dirt and bad service.   I'm amazed these guys can pass FDA standards with serving food partly frozen and a staff that is supposed to follow federal regulations but how they do this is not my business."}
{"text":"I was willing to forgive the fact that they originally forgot both of my kids sandwiches when I called and they promised it would be waiting for me when I got back here to get them. They weren't ready. I had to wait AGAIN. And then, I got the sandwiches and one of them was completely wrong (turkey and cheese when it was supposed to be pb&j). So I had to wait for a THIRD time and just now, 40 minutes after I originally arrived, I'm finally getting my sandwiches. This is insane. I could maaaaaaaaybe forgive if it was busy in here BUT IT'S NOT! How hard is it to make some freaking sandwiches?!"}
{"text":"If I could afford to go to Kneaders once a week I would! I have lived everything I have tried. The food is fresh and filling. The desserts are divine. I dream about the fruit tart, bread pudding and pink pina colada smoothie. It is a great place to go for a girls lunch or a dessert night. I highly recommend Kneaders. It's one of my favorite places to get soup, salads and sandwiches!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! So cute - nice and clean- and SUPER friendly staff. My girls had the French toast and it was too die for. HUGE portions, delicious! We can't wait to come back and try some pastries!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place was packed at noon! There was a line almost out the door when I entered. I browsed through the menu while I waited. Having eaten at a Kneader's Bakery when I visited the SLC area, I was interested in trying out the sandwiches and baked goods here to see if the AZ location was as good as my previous experience.  I decided on the turkey half sandwich ($4.39) on hazelnut 12 grain, a mint chocolate chip brownie, and a soda. The half sandwich was very filling, with nicely seasoned roast turkey, fresh lettuce, tomato, and onion, with mayo. The bread was soft, with large crunchy pieces of hazelnut in it.  The mint chocolate brownie was delicious. It was thick, fudgey, with a light whipped-cream mint frosting.   Sodas are Coke-based, and there is a self serve fountain.  Definitely a tasty place for a sandwich or baked sweet!"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed! It's winter, they should have soup in stock! Two days ago I came through the drive thru & ordered soup bowls for sick neighbors. I got to the window 15 minutes later & they were out of everything!!!! I called the next time & they said chicken noodle would be ready in 30 minutes. I drive over & it's going to be another hour. Ok. Sooooo I order loaded potato & pay for it. Sit to wait & I'm told that soup will be another 15-20 minutes. I'm fuming mad. Plus the girl running the register had not a clue what she was doing. Neither did the drive thru window girl from two days prior. I'm beyond done with this place!!!!if you go, go with an open Mind for whatever they might have in stock!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good place for lunch! Met some associates for lunch here. Its like a knock off of Atlanta Bread or Panera. Had a great hot pastrami!! Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. good menu, lots of soup! No internet made lunch happen quicker than usual lol. Try it you will like it!"}
{"text":"When you have a picky child and manager says they can't sub in Turkey for ham and remove cheese on a kids meal sandwich. Remember, customer service is key and you never know what that one decision will do to impact future customers decision to come back. Read \"The 6,000 Egg\"  by Todd Duncan to fully understand."}
{"text":"I would say this place is equivalent to Paradise or Wildflower. The usual trendy chain food that is a little overpriced. It was pretty good though, I would go back if I was in the area and had few other options."}
{"text":"for the price the French toast is great and it is all you can eat are usually fills me up the first round but if not I go back for the second round and it is great!! The strawberries and cream are always fresh and employees are nice"}
{"text":"I love freebies!!! I was super excited when I saw a sign that offered free sandwiches to  military members for July 4 (see uploaded picture). I told my husband about the deal, so he brought his Army ID to get his complimentary panini. We waited FOREVER to order (the line was almost out the door) only to learn it was a Buy-One-Get-One-Free deal. I don't mind adhering to company policy, but that's not what the sign said. We ordered and waited almost 20 min for our to-go order. The sandwiches were pretty good, but $8.19 each is expensive! I might give it another try if I get a new coupon, but I'll make sure to check the fine print first!!!"}
{"text":"First time here. A pre-theater trip so we just grabbed a few items including a cinnamon roll, cream cheese brownie, cannoli, and an almond poppy muffin top. The cannoli was good, crisp with dense cheese cream. The cinnamon roll was almost as good as homemade. They offered samples of other products and the sample of the walnut bread was delicious. I was sad there were not a few more breakfast type items."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! People are so quick to write bad reviews but I wanted to make sure I took the time and let the world KNOW how AWESOME the team here is! First the food is Fantastic delicious every single time. But for the real MVPS... Dan the manager always greets me by name and welcomes me with a warm smile. (Dan, I appreciate it) Alisha (I know I spelled it wrong) every morning knows my order and is one of the friendliest people I've ever met and is always smiling . And another shout out to the one of the cooks in the back Cassie! And everyone else that makes that I have not had the opportunity to meet you guys are awesome too! You guys all Rock! Keep being AWESOME and doing what you guys do best!  favorite customer EVER -Mike"}
{"text":"First times having lunch there, pleasantly surprised. Good food!"}
{"text":"We had a great dinner at Kneaders today, The turkey bacon avocado sandwich is really good!  My wife had a soup, I can't remember what it was called but it was very good too.  And the kid I loved the cookie! Fresh, clean, good service, and reasonably priced.     Back again, had the turkey bacon avocado again, still 5 star food and service!!!"}
{"text":"Got the endless French toast for breakfast and it was amazing. The syrup is dreamy, the whipped cream is light & fluffy, & the strawberries are fresh. Absolutely yummy. All employees were very respectful and friendly!"}
{"text":"Super frustrated and major fail by this Kneaders tonight.  After going back and forth with the clerk about how 8 $1 cookies does NOT add up to $14, they still charge us for 8 but only give 5.  I'm having a party tomorrow and needed 8...why can't people just do their jobs right??  #Kneadersfail"}
{"text":"I have several bakery options in my area and my first trip to Kneaders was top notch. From the time I walked up to the counter to place my order to the time I left, everyone was so helpful and kind. I ordered the Rueben and it was delicious. It was my own fault that I let the sandwich sit too long before eating it, but for a panini I still feel like it could have been pressed a little longer. Either way, I'll definitely be back and can't wait to try some soup in a bread bowl."}
{"text":"We have been going here since it opened and we have always had a great meal and experience.  It's cafe style and pretty good at it as well.  The lines can be long but the quality of the food I think is great for the type of restaurant it is.    Way better then Paradise Bakery or Wildflower.  There breakfasts and lunches are excellent.  Have not tried dinner but it will be sandwiches etc... I'm sure."}
{"text":"It is a great place to eat, the only thing wrong was the soup wasn't very hot, but was yummy! Was very stuffed when I left there."}
{"text":"I love kneaders- I really do. But DO NOT go through the drive-thru if you are in a hurry. I would say average wait time is 10 minutes.   My only complaint- other than that keep on keeping on Kneaders!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are so good! Pastries are a little heavy.  Lots of food with the combo, worth the price :-)"}
{"text":"Large brownie cheesecake samples which are awesome. Packed and very loud, so that threw me off a bit. Chicken salad had way too much mayonnaise- could be much better. Croissants were very soft and tasty. Wonderful selection of desserts."}
{"text":"Finding something that everyone can agree on in my family can be a challenge. Luckily this place has a bit of everything, and that the bro and sis wanted to bring us here. I wasn't really in the mood for a big meal, but the idea of french toast sounded quite heavenly at the time. You get two big chunks of french toast slices to start with and then it's all downhill from there because it's unlimited. Yeah, that's right. Unlimited. I couldn't eat the second one and had to pass on it. Geez. Next time I'll have to wear something stretchy. We came in on a weekend day brunch-y time, so the place was wee bit of a cluster. While they bring out the food to you at your table, we had to eyeball the servers to make sure they didn't overlook us. They forgot our drinks, so we had to go back up and get them reordered. Eh. I didn't get a chance to try the cinnamon rolls but snacked on some pumpkin bread I packed in my carryon bag. It was quite tasty! I think it made my airplane seat neighbor kind of jealous."}
{"text":"I had my first visit here today after trying to come for several months, but they are closed on Sunday which is real annoying. I ordered a panini and some soup, the soup was ok, served with cold bread and a pad of butter. The panini had no pesto on it even though it was chicken pesto. My friend ordered the triple double melt sandwich and it was super greasy. I am also told the mens bathroom was absolutely disgusting. I will not be returning to this establishment and will go to my favorite place instead, Wildflower Bread Company."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to this Kneaders and it probably be the last. I was here with my daughter and her friend for a post-practice breakfast. The place was busy and when the girls ordered (French toast and a breakfast sandwich) we were told it would be out shortly.  Shortly turned into almost 40 minutes and a line of us asking where our food was and when it would be ready. The excuses ranged from \"We're really busy\" to \" A lot of people ordered French toast\". There was one person in the grill and six in the front. The people in the front made no effort to hide making fun or passing comments about those who were inquiring about their food. I was even advised to not have my daughter get another serving of French toast because the cook was backed up. WTH! We're okay with not visiting this establishment again."}
{"text":"Tried the cranberry salad today! It was amazing! Dressing was so good! Also had the wedding cookies and I could  eat them all day!"}
{"text":"The food and service is 100 times better at Wildflower bread Company! Drive two more miles down the road to wildflower and you will be glad you did. I will never come here again. Such bad customer service.I can be a bit particular and I own that but when I am paying I expect to be satisfied. I always bring it up nicely, I apologize and thank whoever is helping me, I am no not rude at all, but I am assertive. I ordered something that came with varieties that I was unaware of and was not given the variety I had in mind. The person taking my order never asked for a specification, so when I tried it and didn't like the one I had I try to exchange it for the one I wanted or simply return it for a refund. The person helping me would not accommodating at all. They wanted proof of purchase for something I wasn't satisfied with when I'm standing right there with their food item so I obviously purchased it, But I had already thrown away my receipt with my lunch. After waiting 10 minutes in line again hoping to deal with somebody else I got the same person possibly the shift manager and again was apologize to but there was no restitution was even offered."}
{"text":"French dip on baguette is pretty great, as are most of the soups. Chicken noodle leaves something to be desired though. Gorgeous and pretty tasty pastries. Always super packed for lunch. Haven't decided though if it's because it actually really good, or if it's just the only mediocre thing in the heart of a culturally and decent-food-deprived-Gilbert and on a busy intersection. But, if you're near, the only other option is fast good for miles--give it a try."}
{"text":"Did you know that Kneader's serves breakfast? Their breakfast options are simple but SO delicious. Pictured here is the Chunky Cinnamon French Toast. Head in to your nearest @kneaders and grab some scrumptious breakfast. You can thank us later  . .  . . #kneaders #kneadersbakery #organicad #ifthx #kneadersgilbert #frenchtoast #chunkycinnamonfrenchtoast #cinnamon #strawberries #syrup #gilbertaz #breakfast #bakery #cafe #sipsogood"}
{"text":"Came here to pick up a friend who works here and ended up getting lunch. Got the French dip with a frozen hot chocolate and a Napoleon. Definitely thought the inside was a little kitschy and felt like they were trying to emulate Cracker Barrel's whole general store schtick, but, eh, whatever.  The French dip was good, but it definitely could have done with some extra au jus on the side to soften up the rather stiff (but definitely tasty) bread. The Napoleon was delicious, but holy crap was my piece huge. The frozen hot chocolate was perfect for a hot summer day, but I could have done without the slightly gritty texture.  I ended up picking up a couple salted caramel cookies and an ultimate cookie bar on the way out to bring home for the family. Their overwhelming opinion was that their baked goods are fantastic and well worth another trip over (also, when they say salted caramel, they definitely mean it. Yum!).  Overall, it wasn't bad, but by no means was it the best sandwich shop/bakery food I've had. From what I've heard, their breakfast food is better, so I'll definitely have to find the oomph to be a morning person for a day and give them a go."}
{"text":"Decent food terrible service on weekends. Waited a good 20 mins for our food, they forgot my husband's order so I asked for a refund and then they bring it out. It's loud and crowded so loud you cannot hear yourself think. Never again."}
{"text":"While the pastries and other goodies looked amazing we were there for breakfast. I ordered the french toast (I had been told it was \"amazing\") and a chai latte . My husband ordered a breakfast sandwich and a soft drink. The cashier asked if he wanted a combo so he asked what a combo included, she replied \" a drink \" and he said  \"sure, that is what I want-the sandwich and a drink\". Now I think this is where it went wrong - he asked if there was custard inside the eclairs...she was obviously new, it was crazy busy (Memorial Day) and she probably wasn't sure what an eclair was. I got my french toast...not amazing, a little too thick and not warm enough to melt butter. It came with some kind of whipped topping, sliced strawberries and a little cup of not quite rip melon and kiwi. My latte was also luke warm. But at least my food came...my husband never got his sandwich. We stopped one of the runners and asked him why the combo charge but no sandwich. Apparently the cup of unedible melon was the combo?!     We spent over $12 for 2 slices of NOT amazing  french toast, a luke warm latte and a medium sized soft drink. Will NOT be spending our money here again."}
{"text":"I ordered two Thai salads because I had it the other day at a different location and it was great. So I order, they say nothing, get home of course it's missing something. I call in and the lady can 'understand my frustration' that I spent twenty dollars on salad that is missing one of four ingredients. Pause, pause, pause. She doesn't offer a discount or say you can come get your money back if your bring the salad. Or even a discount. Riddle me this, if you are missing a key component in something you charge for can you still charge the same without telling your customers? I told her I would never go back, she told me she hopes my day gets better . Terrible customer service. Now I can only hope that location closes tomorrow or I will never have my revenge."}
{"text":"Went here and tried the French dip. Could not have been more bland! The prices here are average but are still not worth it. The portions are large and because it wasnt very good, I wish they were smaller. Want a good sandwich, see my other reviews!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The service is great, the food is yummy and it's an overall must when you're hungry or just want to satisfy your sweet tooth with their many decadent desserts."}
{"text":"C & I stopped by here on our way to his first performance of Pinocchio. It's fairly close to the theater and I wanted to try it out. Plenty of parking for sure. Since we stopped in around 4:30 on a Thursday, the place was pretty empty. I checked out the different pastries that filled the glass case. Yum. But we weren't there for goodies. The young lady at the counter was a bit aloof. I told her this was our first time at Kneaders and she just stared at me, like, so. Not that I needed any help, but it's nice when employees acknowledge that you picked their restaurant instead of the other 20 or so around. Oh well. I ordered C the Kids Grilled Cheese ($4.79) which came with a bag of chips, bottle of Chocolate Milk and a frosted sugar cookie. The sandwich is only half a sandwich, so if your kid is the hungry type or can normally eat more, this might not be enough. You have to be the judge on that one. For C, it was fine. The bread had a nice toast on it and the cheese was ooey gooey goodness. C said it was \"bangin\". Kid cracks me up. Can't say much for the chips or chocolate milk because they're pre-packaged. C enjoyed the frosted sugar cookie so we'll assume it was o.k. I ordered the Veggie Avocado Sandwich with Asiago cheese ($6.59). I think the price is high for what you get. Sure the bread is decent but hey are a bit scant on the fillings. After all, this is a  vegi sandwich so it should be loaded up with stuff; tomatoes, lettuce, sprouts, mushrooms, bean paste, cucumber, shredded carrots, Avocado etc..., but it isn't. You get a couple nice slices of tomatoe, a slice of cheese, a couple lettuce leaves, some red onion rings, and Avocado. BUT, imagine getting a Roast Beef or Turkey sandwich, opening it up and seeing some of the beef or Turkey with green tinge to it. Gross, right? Well, when you order basically an Avocado sandwich you expect the Avocado to be fresh, not with some brown/black bruised flesh. Yuk. Why, why would anyone assembling an Avocado sandwich not cut off the bad parts. I don't care if the Avocado if in perfect slices. What I do care about is that if I hadn't opened up my sandwich to look, I possible would have eaten that gross rotten Avocado. (Can you tell I love Avocado? Well, I do. I'm a So Cal kid. I was raised on the stuff. My parents used it a lot and I still love it. But I digress)  That being said, I blame the management for poorly training the employess to recognize what is good and bad quality food. I also blame the employees because there comes a point when you have to use COMMON SENSE. Would you eat brown/black Avocado? Is that something that you want on your Avocado sandwich? If the answer is NO then why would you continue putting it on the sandwich? And the assemblers in back were not that busy, which isn't an excuse anyways, but they need to put some pride in their work. This is where I stand on my soapbox for a moment. You know how there are things in this world where the creater puts their name on it. Like, art work, custom engines, garments, hand bags etc... Maybe that's what we need in food. Make the poeple who assemble or cook our food also include a slip of paper that says, \"Lovingly created by Joe Schmo\", or whomever. You get the picture. I wonder if things would improve.  Interesting decor, average (at best) customer service, fair kids meal, using produce that should be thrown out, poor value sandwich. 1.5 Stars."}
{"text":"Very slow. Never been in the drive at any other place longer then I do at Kneader's. I don't know what they are doing different but 20 min minimum sitting in a drive through for a sandwich is ridiculous. And it's not just this location. Every. Single. One. Is SLOW!!!"}
{"text":"After a dinner in east Mesa we decided to go out for coffee and dessert.  We went to kneader's where I had never been.  My wife and friends had been here before and raved on their breads and desserts.  One of our coffee's came out of the thermos cold and had to advise the staff.  They immediately changed it out and made sure we got a hot cup of coffee.  They also came back and gave us a large ice tea which they said was over poured so it was on the house.  We ordered a Napoleon, a bread pudding, a fruit tart and a cheesecake.  The Napoleon was boring to me, the other three desserts were good.  Overall, we had a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped by here for a late breakfast and boy was it cute!!! Kneaders has such a home-y vibe. Everything we ordered was delish & it was hard not to walk away with 500 loaves of their artisan bread. We had an awesome experience and can't wait to come back and try the French Toast!"}
{"text":"My mom and I love Kneader's! The food is always fresh and I'm never disappointed when I try something new. Everything is great from the salads and sandwiches to there drinks and soups, but there baked good and sweets are AMAZING. Friendly service, fresh and yummy food...you know we will be back!"}
{"text":"First time to eat here & was very surprised!  The food is awesome for the price!"}
{"text":"This place is way over priced for what you get. We tried it twice and both times didn't impress me. I'll stick I paradise bakery"}
{"text":"It took almost 10 minutes for the whole staff to figure out how to use our gift card. Food was good but was very sloppily put together. A lot of the lettuce was old and withered. I would recommend eating somewhere else"}
{"text":"For me this is an OK place. I got the avocado salad but the dressing they give you is so little it's not worth even putting on the salad. I guess I could have gone back for more dressing but I took half my salad home and put my own dressing on it."}
{"text":"Clients wanted me to join them for breakfast on a Saturday morning so of course I wanted to go. This is a bread place with limited choices for breakfast items but what they really do well here is the French toast. Set up like a pei Wei style where you order and they bring the food to the table which literally took less than 5 minutes.french toast was excellent and I could only eat one piece, it was extremely filling. Based on the people in line I would recommend getting here early, it gets extremely busy!"}
{"text":"Best food ever. Kinda pricey though. Their French dip is absolutely amazing. I love their food and always stop by when I come to town. Their bakery items are fabulous as well. I always get the berry tarts."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Love having this delicious and healthy option so close to my house.  Nothing beats their chocolate domes.  And drive thru desserts? Yes, please!"}
{"text":"Now, let me preface this by saying that my favorite restaurants are the ones that find ways to make healthy foods taste amazing.  That being said, there wasn't much that was healthy about this place.    Being vegetarian, I ordered the only meatless panini, a Triple Double Melt--which was a ginormous double layer grilled cheese sandwich with 3 layers of French Country Bread and 2 layers of cheese, all grilled in butter (I had them add tomatoes so I'd have some semblance of greenery).  The best part about it was definitely the bread...but it wasn't amazing enough in my opinion to justify all the empty calories and fat.  I also ordered the one vegetarian soup option--which was an artichoke portobello soup.  The soup literally looked and tasted like Thanksgiving gravy; it was thick, gray, and much too creamy with like 3 random chunks of vegetables.  If I had some mashed potatoes, it probably would've been awesome on top...but just not as a soup! :/   They DO have a rather awesome dessert case filled with all sorts of cakes, cookies, caramel apples, etc.  Since Valentine's Day was approaching, I thought I'd be festive and order a heart-shaped sugar cookie.  Unfortunately, the sugar cookie (while cute) was rather mediocre.  There were lots of other treats that looked yummy though.  In summary, if you're looking to indulge, you'd probably love it here.  Great bread (hence the name Kneader's), lots of beautiful desserts, cute little tchotchkes for sale, and nice staff.  But as someone who tries to eat semi-healthy foods, I felt like my arteries were crying for help when I left.  Don't think I'll be back here for any food but perhaps to buy a cute pastry for a special occasion."}
{"text":"At first I was a bit wary of this place because it has a drive through and claims to make things fresh.  However after going there I'm now a believer, I always order the Dave's BLT because it's delicious.  There is quite a range of breads to choose from so the same sandwich can be different every time!  The Parmesan chips they make there are super delicious!  I definitely recommend giving them a try if you're in the area!!"}
{"text":"Super fast, super nice and great breakfast sandwich and caramel macchiato. :) We were skeptic as it was a drive thru but honestly it was super convenient and didn't lack quality at all. The cashier was really nice and everything went seamlessly. We'll return! :)"}
{"text":"The roast beef ranch sandwich is awesome! Then my mom turns me on to the frozen hot chocolate drink with whip cream. I am not sure the exact name. OMG! I think I died than gone to heaven."}
{"text":"This place is good for lunch...not breakfast!! Also if your coming for lunch be prepared to wait a while there is always a huge line. I think this place is over rated..deserts are good and a few of the sandwiched but definitely nothing special."}
{"text":"really like the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches here. It's unfortunate that for half a sandwich you have to spend over $5. Had a really bad day and wanted to comfort food a PB&J sandwich and the manager refused to sell it for less than the entire meal of $5 plus. for a home-grown and supposedly socially conscious business I don't think they really care about their customers at all. when you have something that is very popular you should go all out to be able to sell it to the customers that want it. Bad deal Kneaders!"}
