{"text":"I've been here a few times.....very inconsistent. Most recent visit I inquired about the size of the perch fillets, I informed them on previous visits the fillets were very small the length of my ring finger!!!!. Waitress said \"oh no we have full size pieces of fish and the weigh out at 10oz.  Ok my husbands order was 3 large and 1 medium, mine was 4 tiny pieces. No where near the same amount I sent it back and did not eat there. Also the shrimp is cheap frozen and heavily battered!  Poor customer service, they need real wait staff not family/friends.They are connected to a nice bar The Empty Glass."}
{"text":"I brought my mom and niece and my mom said the cook was heaven sent. Great service and food."}
{"text":"A tiny family owned restaurant with small coastal charm.  The two fish platters we tried were both very nice.  Their blackened catfish was cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly and the portion was generous.  Their mac n cheese side was great also.  I can't wait to come back to try the rest of their other soul food inspired menu. The Seafood Place Plus smells like a seafood restaurant you would find by the sea.  I hope it means that they get whole fish in and are heavy on the scaling and prepping, as opposed to less desirable reasons for the smell. We found a scale or two in our Grilled Perch.  Even though it tasted excellent, it was a bit of a put off.  Take out would be a good option for those who are uncomfortable at 'dive-ish' or odoriferous places.  All in all, the Seafood Place was good enough for me to want to go back (take out)."}
{"text":"My family and I stumbled across this place on our trip to cleveland the food was very good the service And  staff was very friendly the fish came out nice and hot I would go back again if I'm ever it in this part of town.  When I returned back to Wisconsin a friend of mine said that he had also went there and the food was really good."}
{"text":"Have very good fish.  The atmosphere is very casual.  I ordered yams because I cannot find those enough.  They were too sweet, and the greens were too salty, so if you need to stay salt & sugar free, let them know up front."}
{"text":"Hidden amongst  some big heavyweight eateries (Melt & Cafe Tandoor), this lil informal eatery  offers a great opportunity for some great seafood and ribs.   I started with some Shrimp Chowder (done New England style) and the taste was just phenomenal.  Great balance with both flavor and spice level that would make Goldilocks say proud!  For my entree, I had the Blackened Catfish with their hand-cut homemade fries and both were just fantastic.  The Blackened Catfish had that Louisiana kick that ya just can't find just anywhere.  Service was friendly, quick and friendly...just another reason I think people in the Heights are spoiled with an amazing array of eateries!  Worth the visit!"}
