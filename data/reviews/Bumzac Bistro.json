{"text":"Awesome new restaurant at Carolina place mall. Our server Robert was very informative and great. My party had the mussels, fried chicken sandwich , fried shrimp and the Cajun pasta. Absolutely delicious! Kudos to the bread they bring out!!!!! This place has been open three months and I'm sad it's taken me so long to try it. I can't wait to come back and try other things. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"For only being open 3 days this mall restaurant brought their A game.  For the same price I would pay at many food court restaurants, Bumzak delivered a bistro fine dining experience with excellent high quality food unmatched by places I've eaten for 3 times as much.  It's not somewhere you would normally walk by unless you happened to park on the far side of the mall.  It's opposite the food court."}
{"text":"The food was really good, reasonably priced, and they serve a great chicken sandwich. But caution the queso dip is spicier than what some would expect and doesn't say anything about spicy on the menu. I would highly recommend trying this place, it's so much tastier and fresher than the food court food!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with friends.  Beautiful day so sat on the patio.  The food was excellent, as was the service.  Would definitely dine here again!  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"What a great find!  This restaurant was so cool and the food was great. I had a chicken dish that tasted wonderful.  Chicken was moist and tender and the mashed potatoes were the best!  The service was great. Nice bar area if you just want a rest from shopping!  It's in the Carolina Place mall in Pineville.  Stop by and try it."}
{"text":"Lunch on Saturday, wasn't busy. This is the old Fresh To Order place.  I still miss it!' Cool revamp, tho. I don't think it belongs in the mall. This place deserves it's own space out of the mall. Server was a little slow, not very knowledgeable but nice. I ordered the sweet tea and Frank ordered a beer which was three cents less than a sweet tea. We just had apps which included  shrimp, which is a take on the bonefish grill bang bang shrimp. We also ordered crab cake  that came with corn relish.  Frank really liked the shrimp but I'm going to make it better tonight for dinner. I felt like the shrimp itself was dry and tough like the shrimp with pre-cooked before it was breaded and fried, but the breading was very good. The crabcake was one crabcake and corn relish that was a little too hot for me because of the jalape√±o in it. It needed more sauce on top. The shrimp could've used more sauce and it could've been put into a better container than a little plastic cup.  The wait was really long for our food even though there were only about two or three tables. The server came back to our table after we had asked why it was taking so long and we were told that the crabcake takes long. No it doesn't. Crab is a delicate item and should never take long to cook because you'll dry it out or ruin it completely. I would come back here and give it a second shot but overall it was OK."}
