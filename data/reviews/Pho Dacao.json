{"text":"Pho Dacao is the latest addition to the numerous pho restaurants near Vaughan Mills. Pho Dacao is just west of Highway 400 in the same plaza as Ay Caramba. Since Pho Dacao is new, it wasn't busy when we visited for weekend dinner. We ordered the rare beef and beef brisket pho, the grilled chicken with fried egg, and a beef curry, which is a weekend special. The pho was just okay. The broth was standard -- there wasn't anything special about it. The beef had a lot of fat on it and I thought there was just a lot more noodles compared to other ingredients. The beef curry was just okay. I thought the curry was a little on the watery side. The grilled chicken was probably the best dish of the three that I tried. The grilled chicken was comparable to other Vietnamese restaurants. You can definitely taste the charcoal on those grill marks and the chicken was tender on the inside. The eggs were perfectly cooked. Overall, I think Pho Dacao is similar to many of the other Vietnamese restaurants in the area."}

The stir fried noodles were amazing! The chef knew how to work the wok because it had a nice hint of burnt ness which is essential to any stir fry dish! My most favourite dish was the Thai beef stew egg noodles!"}
{"text":"Grand opening today! Quickly got in and ordered the XL special pho like always, glad they actually had the XL option as most pho places in the area don't! The place was nice and spacious and waiters were attentive.  On to the pho!: The broth was mild with a hint of sweetness and on the oilier side, comparable to places like Pho tai bac and pho Vietnam in Scarbs so if you like those places you will love pho Dacao. The flavour was not my cup of tea but all the ingredients and meat seemed fresh and they had flat noodles which I love. Quantity was great for the price and if you ask they give you chili peppers and pickeled chili condiments. Overall a solid addition to the neighbourhood!"}
