{"text":"Granted, pizza isn't the healthiest of foodstuff, but this restaurant delivers a hearty all-dressed pizza for a fast meal.  Submarines could be cheesier & meatier than lettuce.  They have a good deal of deli meals and has a rapid delivery service."}
{"text":"Dropped by for an extra large pepperoni pizza. The pizza is the traditional Quebec style pizza topped generously with cheese, sauce and ingredients. The pizza was pretty good! Sometimes that greasy pizza can really hit the spot! It's pretty heavy though.  Price-tag wise, it's relatively expensive for what it is but it does the job. It did take about 25 minutes to get the pizza, it took a bit longer than expected but the results were gooood, so it was worth it.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Tastiest pizza around. Seems like one of those pizza places that you only taste it once and your hooked. Best crust, way too many toppings...just right. Family owned and the best thing is they remember you even if you only get there once a year. Very Friendly Comfortable relaxed place. You,ll leave stuffed every time! If not...try a piece of pie!!!! ;-p"}
