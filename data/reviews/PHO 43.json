{"text":"Great customer service.  We had to wait a while for our dessert so when we asked how much longer they apologized for the wait & said it was on the house which was really nice. Then when we went to pay they had taken the drinks off as well for any inconvenience which shows they really care. Food is good. Macaroon ice cream sandwhich was great. First time trying Pandan flavor ice cream and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Don't fear the looks of the place, like they say you can't judge a book by its cover. They have the Best Pho in Phoenix, their broth is flavorful not watered down like so many others I've tried. Bun Bo Hue is really good as well.  Spring Rolls are always fresh not dried out, delicious  peanut dipping sauce! Only place you can find French Macarons on the West side of town. Overall a must try if new to the area, or a place to cherish and frequent often if you're a local."}
{"text":"This place has some tasty pho, although sometimes it isn't as good as other times, it usually has good flavor. The bbq chicken and rice is also really good, not to mention the yummy homemade macarons they sell on the weekends."}
{"text":"This place can get really busy. But it's worth the wait. My favorite dish is the Bun Thit Nguong with grilled shrimp and a side of egg. I like their pho and mi broth so I tend to order a meat ball soup on the side. That's a lot of food already but man oh man is it good!!! I'll recommend this place to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"The food and customer service is amazing! I love coming here. Will always refer you guys to anyone I know looking for an authentic pho restaurant"}
{"text":"Wow pretty darn good. Kinda traveled far to eat here and I'm happy to say we were not disappointed.  Don't be quick to judge the outside of restaurant but head inside. When you walk in you will get a whiff of something delicious cooking in the back.  We ordered Thai tea and Jasmine ice tea which was ok. Then we got the egg rolls and shrimp rolls which was also good. Then of course Pho for 2. We both thought the Pho was pretty good and the broth was little on the sweet side but still delish.  Now after seeing all the picture of the macaroons I had to save room for them. I tried the taro with ice cream and plain and it was too sweet for me.  The service was great. Well if I'm in this part of town I will definitely be here eating again."}
{"text":"Best place for Vietnamese food and pho on the planet. I've been coming here for years. The staff is very friendly and attentive. I recommend this place to anyone and everyone. A+"}
{"text":"This place is way overrated. The soup is good but the meat is just really cheap, and the customer service is rude and quiet. The place feels very dirty too and the macaroons are overpriced."}
{"text":"We love this place. Phenomenal family ran restaurant. It's been there for probably 25 years. Bin Xio is one of my favorites, my husband loves the spring rolls and the salty plum soda. The Vietnamese Iced Latte is better than any Starshmucks."}
{"text":"My first time here was 2 months ago, for me the food need more flavor. I went to another vietnamese restaurants and compari g to this one theyre much better. Try the one is n camelback pho van and theres another in 19 th ave da vang."}
{"text":"Amazing pho love this place it's small but I don't care , the various times that I been there none never disappointed me ... I will continue to go here and I tell everyone about this spot"}
{"text":"Amazing food & staff are so friendly my sisters and I  always go *rice and pork is our favorite"}
{"text":"This place has the best pho and ice cream macarons I've ever had in Phoenix. They have pandan-flavored ice cream and macarons! I mean who does that?? The pandan flavor totally reminds me of my homeland - Indonesia. My friend and I ordered no. 2, no. 10, some egg rolls, and a lot of macarons. We left happy and satisfied even though I totally parked right at the turning lane. Needless to say, I'm definitely going back again.   I forgot to mention that the service there was top-notch. Everyone was great and friendly!"}
{"text":"I hardly want to tell anyone, because I want to keep the place all to myself.  WOW.  Be adventurous. Try the soda with egg yolk and condensed milk, or the salty plum soda.  The soup bowls are gigantic. The egg rolls come with a platter of greens and dipping sauce. The prices are inexpensive and the service is great.  At 2pm all the tables were full. That tells you something.  UPDATE:  Went the very next day with entire family. We each tried a different rice noodle soup. Everyone liked what they got, but we will note that meat is more of a garnish, so if you want more meat, you should order an extra order of it ont he side, which a lot of people do. But just know that at $6-9 (depending on what kind of soup you order), you are getting a lot of food that will fill you up, if you like a lot of fresh vegetables, noodles and broth. The broth is heavenly.  On our way out we were followed out the front door to be given a rare treat: a macaroon ice cream sandwich, gratis. Now they probably don't make a habit of doing this, but we thought it was very generous, and it tasted out of this world!  This is probably going to be a go-to lunch spot form now on!"}
{"text":"This place ruined all other Vietnamese food for me because nothing else can compare!. The staff is friendly, and the food is incredible. The serving sizes are more than generous, especially for the price. This is one of the best values in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is great. It's so hard getting a decent authentic Asian meal in West Phoenix but this place sure does make it way easier. Me clearly fitting the stereotype of a rebellious teenager, I ditched my study group and decided to stop by this joint. I live 2 minutes away from this place and I'd passed by several times paying no attention to it, partly the placement of the location was very odd (in between a daycare and a Mexican Market). This place just kept bugging me. Eventually, I decided to Google it to see whether it was legit or not. After reading several reviews I was convinced; I NEED TO TRY THIS PLACE OUT. I literally walked into the place and asked \"hey, I'm new to this place, what do you recommend?\" The owner (didn't catch his name, unfortunately) instantly gave me options; his best recommendation was the pho. I had never eaten pho so I immediately ordered it. I soon took a seat and was handed some water. In what seemed no time at all, my food was served. The actual pho plate was huge and kind of intimidating; it was accompanied by basil, beansprouts, and lemon slices on a separate dish. The owner gave me a quick rundown on how to eat pho. He explained the sauces and how to break up the noodles at the bottom of the place and just the basics. The food is amazing. The beef in this dish was delicious, noodles were perfect, and the addition of the sweet sauce made this experience one I'll never forget. At first, due to my horrible hand-eye coordination, eating the noodles was a bit tough but as soon as I got a hang of it, I couldn't get enough. Surprisingly, I was expecting the check to be around $15, but it was only $6. This place is totally affordable. There is no excuse for someone not to stop by. I definitely recommend and encourage anyone in the area to try this out! Its the best Asian food I've had. I've eaten at other Asian places (ie. Kabuki at Tempe Marketplace) and though their food is also good, their hospitality isn't. Not only does Pho 43 Express have great food, but also polite, patient, and understanding staff. Thank you so much for allowing me the pleasure of eating here. I plan on stopping by again soon."}
{"text":"The saying \"don't judge a book by its cover\" works both ways. A beautifuly decorated, squeaky clean establishment located in the most upscale and \"safe\" area... doesn't always equal great food. I live in chandler but being a true Vietnamese, I will make the drive to this place for a taste of home. The rich flavorful pho itself is what I crave for most and they never disappoint. If you're the type that eats with your eyes and needs to break the piggy just for a meal to feel like what you ate was good then by all means come to chandler for your viet food fix. For those who truly know and appreciate what Vietnamese food should taste like in any environment...I highly recommend this mom/pop joint."}
{"text":"Only place I'll ever go to have some pho and ice cream macaroons :) love their spring rolls!"}
{"text":"This is the best pho in town! And they treat you like family after only coming to eat here a couple of times.   Bonus points for having the most delicious macaron ice cream sandwiches.... Delicious tip: get taro cookie with taro ice cream rolled in Cap'n Crunch. Orgasm in your mouth.   We come here nearly every Sunday and have never had a bad meal. It's always perfect, especially if you're in need of a hangover cure."}
{"text":"Looks rough on the outside and walking inside doesn't make you feel much better. But trust me this place is AMAZING. Family run restaurant and you can taste the love in the food. Pho is great. And treat yourself to a cup of the Vietnamese coffee. Truly a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"My best friend and I decided to visit this place today, rather than another Vietnamese restaurant. It was a bad decision on our part. I know not to go into a Vietnamese restaurant for the ambience and/or top par customer service, but this place takes the cake for all bad service. The workers are non-welcoming in attitude, and they will nickle & dime you for each and every little thing --- without telling you ahead of time. Extra bean sprouts? That'll be extra $2! Extra basil? Another $2! And you'll find out AFTER, when you go up to pay. And here's a zinger --- a Vietnamese guy, working in a Vietnamese restaurant, and has a Vietnamese name --- who do not speak Vietnamese. WTH! Too many other good Vietnamese restaurants in our wonderful city to waste energy and emotion ok this place. Our first time. Our last time."}
{"text":"Amazing :-) and so delicious the macarons were to die for I tried five different flavors and I can't tell you which ones better because they all tasted amazing the feeling that U in the middle or so rich and creamy there definitely the place to go for macaroons I tried other bakeries from the Biltmore to Arrowhead mall and this place is the best and the most friendliest the soup was delicious to the broth had a lot of flavor did not have to add a lotta stuff because it had such a great flavor the place is very clean inside it could use a little freshening up on the outside just some paint but the food was excellent and the macarons were to die for if you're looking to impress someone with a specialties gift stop by and check out their macaroons I can't tell you how wonderful they are and I've been to five or six places in the valley and none of them compare to this place they are big fresh and not frozen like a lot of other places this is the first time I ever been here and I definitely would be back don't let the area scare you the inside is very clean and I can't say I like to many places but this is definitely a keeper"}
{"text":"Good place for spring rolls.  No doubt."}
{"text":"Well worth what you pay. The service was good. I believe it is a family oriented place so their chill approach may be taken as bad service. The Pho broth was good. Their macaroons are good too. The veggies served with the pho was fresh."}
{"text":"Delish! I will be back and it's only 5 min away!!! Bun Bo Hue was very tasty but... I'm from the bay area and they are missing a few key ingredients =("}
{"text":"The food was amazing. . The service was great and quick. I would recommend my family and friends to eat here. And it was quiet and not noisy like other restraunts."}
{"text":"I like macarons and macaron ice cream sandwiches here!  They have attractive appearance,bright colors, sweet taste. Service here also very great !"}
{"text":"By far the best pho joint in phoenix.  all those new pho restaurants over in mesa and chandler..yea is waay nice looking but the food cant compare...and can't beat $5 bowls of pho either.  there #46 is really great here also"}
{"text":"I'm from Vietnam and can vouch for the fact that this place is LEGIT for some very tasty and authentic Pho.  Excellent Pho is determined by the broth that comes with it and 43rd Express' broth is GREAT!!!  This is my favorite place for Pho in the Valley and we come here at least once a week so I can get my Pho fix.  My Caucasian fiance won't eat the yummy Pho but can get the BBQ fried rice that David (his family owns this great restaurant) fixes for him.  The pork fried rice is really good also!  We also love coming in to see David as he treats us like old friends and are great to all his customers!  Can't really beat this place.  We love the food and the service we get from David and his staff!!  See you this weekend David!!"}
{"text":"Saw a friend post pictures about this place and i had to try it. LOVE their macaroons!! Thai tea is amazing and the pho is delicious. I brought my cousin who dislikes macaroons and let's just say one bite was all it took to change her mind. Definitely returning! Can't wait to place special orders. (Graduation & birthday macaroons)"}
{"text":"These people keep texting me receipts for people that eat at their rest. When I call immediately after they ring the receipt and give them the amount, they tell me there's nothing they can do to stop texting me other people's receipts. I find that ridiculous and harassing. Very unprofessional business."}
{"text":"Loved the food and the family! The dessert at the end was so sweet and just the right way to end your lunch ! Must go to ! I will be back for sure! Go lebron!"}
{"text":"Tried this place on a Friday night and was pleasantly surprised. It was my first time trying pho, and it was really good. One serving was too much for me, they include alot of meat and veggies. With the yelp check in I also received a free drink, I chose iced coffee with condensed milk. Very good and strong. I ended the meal with an red velvet macroon and panden ice cream. The macaroon was the best I've tasted! Definitely a good place for a quick lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"My wife, the Sinaloence, had visited this small Mom & Pop restaurant a few weeks ago with a girlfriend. We were in the middle of doing chores driving here to there when she spotted the restaurant (Phô 43 Express) and prevailed on me to sample the Vietnamese cuisine.  On entering it appeared as any hole-in-the-wall food place. Eleven tables in all - with four of the tables able to seat six to eight patrons comfortably. Now don't get me wrong, for me, a hole-in-the-wall restaurant is generally a good thing. We are all acquainted with the major chain restaurants and their accompanying virtues and vices. It is the unique I look for and that is found in the small independent restaurants.   The atmosphere is very much a well worn family restaurant.  The walls are painted a Robin's egg blue, the floors, a faux stone pattern not unappealing, not artsy - adequate. the table tops are well worn with the linoleum transparent in parts showing the base. Untold dishes have rubbed the tops down in places. It's not overbearing just there.   As usual I tested for cleanliness. I rubbed the walls at the window sills inspected the floors. CLEAN. The restaurant is worn but clean. A sure sign that the owners know what they are doing.   The young men that waited on us were humble and anxious to please,  a winsome combination. When I and the Sinaloence entered the room they were busy, a full house. Another sign that the owners know what they are doing. Even though they were busy we did not wait long for food or attention.   I ordered the number 21. Com Bi Cha Thit Nuong.  It is grilled pork and shredded pork on a bed of white rice and a steamed egg. I asked about the steamed egg and was told it was meatloaf. Steamed egg is meatloaf? It must be an idiomatic expression with a lot lost in the translation. It turns out it is not meatloaf but it is a riced up pork that has the texture and feel of a very light meatloaf. The waiter gave me his best food translation and he was right in providing that discription - go figure. The grilled pork on the rice was to die for. The whole plate was a delightful contrast of subtle sweet and savory with the grilled pork leading the way. The rice was perfectly prepared, I mean perfectly prepared. Light, fluffy and pearly white. The rice with the fish sauce continued the sweet and savory theme. I could not be more delighted.   50 years ago the U.S. and North Vietnam had a shooting conflict. The opposing Vietnamese generals made a huge mistake at the beginning of the war. If they had lined up a 5-Mile long buffet table and served the G.I.'s grilled pork on a bed of white rice they would have won the war in four hours. I mean who in their right mind would shoot at someone who can prepare food this good? I know that if I were there I would have set my M-16 to the side grabbed a pair of chop sticks, sat down and asked,  \"More fish sauce please?\"   Atmosphere: 3 Cleanliness: 4 Cuisine:5  Overall an outstanding 4. Don't hesitate to get out of the culinary box and visit Phô 43 Express."}
{"text":"Standing room only!  Love this family ran place. If you're a pho junkie, stop by this place."}
{"text":"Great PHO'. !  Family made, family run...  Super spring rolls, did I say excellent PHO'. ?  YES... Closer to 4.5 stars *"}
{"text":"Came back for the second time this week and had a great experience again. One of the best pho I've ever had! It was Pho-nom-enal!! ^_^  For dessert, I had the Pandan Macaron with Pandan Ice Cream sandwich and my friend had the Red Velvet Macaron with Cookies & Cream Ice Cream. Lastly, picked up lots of Macarons before my trip back to NYC.   Can't wait to come back again, one of my reasons to visit AZ again. :)"}
{"text":"Super great little spot, glad I came across this place a while ago they have great food all the way around. I have enjoyed everything I've gotten from here and will be back for sure as many time as I can when I'm over here."}
{"text":"First time here on a Saturday afternoon, small restaurant but pretty good business. Food taste OK, but I still prefer our regular pho place at 19th Ave and between Camelback & Campbell (for yummy deep fried spring rolls, better variety of food and prices).    $$ One thing I must mention is the bill total seems overcharged a dollar or two for some reason, I am not sure whether they charge for the bean sprouts that serve with the noodle soup.  Since they don't provide paper receipt, so I requested an email receipt but it only show the total amount, not showing detailed charges so I have no clue why I was charged extra. Even though it's not a big amount but feeling strange."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place! Its worth the trip, sometimes 2 times a day even!! This place has delicious food! I usually get their pho but today i couldnt decide what to get, but after a preview, I tried their birds nest for the first time and omigod it hit the spot. Mixed veggies with pork, crab meat, whole shrimps sitting on top of deep fried noodles drizzled with the tastiest sauce; cant be beat anywhere else! Best in the west phoenix! Service is amazing. Walking through the door they greet you with warm hellos and smiles on their faces. I love coming here!"}
{"text":"This place has great pho! It has a homemade feel to it. Nice proportion and even nicer affordable prices.  Great fried egg rolls and the macaroons are to die for. I've been coming for years. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"First time trying, definitely would come back. The place isn't designed luxuriously, fancy or anything but the food is heaven. I like the com thit nuong, I didn't try the Pho yet cause they were out of it. The desert macaroon is the bomb!!! Customer service is excellent, too. Highly recommend you to try this place."}
{"text":"I like macarons. I like ice cream. Seeing pictures of these put together makes my heart and tastebuds excited. Unfortunately, I don't know any known good places, if any, in NYC that do this- so when I knew I was visiting Phoenix again, I made this a top priority to eat.  Verdict? Awesome idea! Why has this not caught on east coast?!! If it is- direct me where to go! I think it's priced very reasonably. I tried the pandan macaron Thai tea ice cream sandwich, and a taro macaron separately. The macarons are flavorful. The Thai tea ice cream was good, but I couldn't taste the Thai tea necessarily. I would love to come back and try other combinations. Call ahead as I hear they run out often.  The pho and summer rolls I also tried were decent and service is friendly. No frills restaurant so don't expect any grand sense of decor."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I went here to try the macaroon ice cream sandwiches for the first time and was amazed :) Everyone who worked here was extremely friendly, and they even gave my friend and I some free macaroons to try! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Yummy, but not worth 10 dollas for the amount of food, plus i paid $2 more for extra pork(that's included in 10 bucks) i was also bummed they only sell egg rolls in multiples for 6 dollars, that was the number 1 reason i went there because they had shrimp free egg rolls. Overall food was tasty, but not the hottest and over priced, or lack of quantity."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place! The first place ive ever had pho and the only place ill eat it! When you know something is so good why go somewhere else right? Thats how i feel anyways! Its a great little place, but don't judge a book by its cover! Please domt knock it until you try it! Everytime i come to phoenix i try to come here! Its not too pricey so it works perfectly with my budget"}
{"text":"I have lived in the Maryvale area for over 20 years, and didn't find out about this place until a few month ago.   I wish I would have known sooner, this place is amazing, not only the food but the staff as well. It is always the same employees, most of them young and they always appreciate you stopping in.   I usually get the #1, which is a basic Pho. By far the best Pho I have ever had.   They also have macaroons, not just your basic macaroon but they also have huge ones that they use for Ice cream sandwiches. AMAZING!  DO NOT LET THE LOCATION FOOL YOU, TRY THIS PLACE YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."}
{"text":"When you want good pho, this is the ultimate spot. The broth is perfect and they top the right amount of noodles and meat.   My personal favorite dish is the lemon grass chicken and the homemade fresh soybean milk."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food around! Great Pho and if you are lucky and it's the right day the macarons are to die for."}
{"text":"Amazing pho, tons of flavor portioned just right. End it with a freshly made Macaroon. Will visit every time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The BEST pho of all time is at 43rd express, and I've had pho from Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco & NYC.  Several other places are good and even great, but none of those places have combined all the elements for such consistently perfect pho as 43rd Express.    It's worth the 20 mile drive to 43rd avenue, just south of Thomas.  Beware you don't go on Tuesday, as that's the day they are closed.  The prices are low and the portions are large.  The Super Extra Large #1 is a steal,  and it also happens to be the most expensive item on the menu, which is saying a lot - you won't find anything on the menu that costs more than $10.    The \"Super Large\" bowl is enough to feed 2-2.5 people, or one seriously addicted pho-aholic.  Their #1 will set you back $7.25, which is plenty for 99% of the pho-eating population.  The #1, features steak, flank, brisket, tendon and tripe.  I ask them to remove the tripe in favor of extra tendon, which they deliver in gargantuan amounts.  This is no ordinary tendon, I've attached pictures to illustrate, but their tendon has great texture with chunks of succulent beef still attached.  Trust me, it's the best ever.    The broth is the best I've ever had, you can tell they don't ever rush a batch, they always have a perfectly seasoned broth with great consistency.  They have a large variety of beverages, from smoothies, salty plum drink, iced tea and sodas to coconut beverage.  There's plenty of variety in that department.  They also have a great variety of macarons for dessert.  There is seating for 50 people, which would be very packed for this relatively small location.  At lunch time it is busy and you likely have a bit of a wait, but never longer than 10 minutes in my experience.    I've only discussed a few small aspects of the menu, but everything here is quality and authenticity.  When you make it to the family owned 43rd Express, you're in for a real treat and a final destination for your pho eating pleasure."}
{"text":"One of the best Pho places in the Valley hands down. The flavor of the broth is just incredible. There are so many places in Phoenix that just water down their pho so they can sell more bowl of it. But what's the point when you are selling hot water.   This is truly a family ran business with all the siblings that work together, couldn't imagine working with my sister everyday =P.  I had the pho tai with meatballs added so I highly recommend that and the eggrolls are fantastic. I also had the Thai tea which was awesome. My last visit was a rice plate and that was great too.   You will not be disappointed with this place and I live in Chandler!"}
{"text":"Amazing! The service was great. So friendly and helpful in modifying my order since I dont eat red meat. The Pho was delicious, and priced great. But then we asked about those glorious macaroons. Traditional ones are weekends only but they had the cookies to make the ice cream sandwiches. Taro with chocolate chip ice cream. My lord it was perfect. I don't like desserts but that taro macaroon was nothing short of perfect. Will definately be going back for both the Pho and the macaroons!"}
{"text":"I shared the pho (with steak and brisket) as well as, the noodles with the fried egg roll (veggies, and a fried egg) with my husband. Everything was absolutely delicious! We have not had pho this good before. The broth was so flavorful and perfectly savory, the steak and brisket were so tender. We were stuffed by the end of it, but saw lots of people enjoying their amazing desserts. We are so glad to find our favorite Pho spot."}
{"text":"The foods that are excellent and fair price. Recommend to try, you will love this place."}
{"text":"Why go to a pho place when you can go to a pho place that also sells macaroons? The place was pretty full on the sunday afternoon we stopped in. The pho was yummy as was the kids rice plate. The macaroons were delicous and you can tell the guy making them is passionate about his work. He also took time to explain how to enjoy your pho to the fullest. My highlight was the ice cream macaroon sandwhiches. The place looks a little rough but if your willing to look past the exterior you will be pleasently suprised."}
{"text":"Pho 43 is a big joke. The pho broth is flavorless, and chintzy contents (noodles and meats). They gave a few strands of bean sprouts and a few leaves of basil. Requested for a little more basil to eat with soup, and they behaved as though it was breaking their bank and greatly impacted their profit margin. So much so that they added an additional $3 onto my bill, WITHOUT telling me until we finished eating and went up to pay. Underhanded business tactics. Let's also point out their discriminatory customer service. We are Vietnamese, so they seem to favor and kiss up to all other ethnicities with \"hello, how are you\" greetings, when we received nothing. They were extra observant of all other tables except ours, when it came to water refills, etc. For all future pho outings we will ONLY go the extra mile or two to  Da Vàng, 4538 N 19th Ave, Phoenix, AZ 85021, (602) 242-3575. They have always been consistent with their above-par food quality level, and nice customer service. Since we are going to spend our hard-earned monies, we want to spend it where we know we will always get more for our monies -- food quality & portion  AND customer service."}
{"text":"My first time dining here and it is probably the best pho in town and the best I've had in a long while. Walking up to the restaurant, I was a bit skeptical as the outside appearance does not quite match what was inside. As we walked in (I went with a friend who had been before) we picked a table and sat down. The waiter was over promptly with menus and water.   The place is on the small side, with maybe 10-12 tables in total. Each table comes with most things you will need like chopsticks, chili paste and hoisin sauce. We decided to get the fried egg rolls, the spring rolls and my friend went with the rare steak pho while I opted for the chicken. We were told sadly that they are out of the egg rolls so we did not get to try those.   The spring rolls were served quickly and were delicious. They had the standard filling of shrimp, lettuce, cucumbers and rice vermicelli with a side of peanut sauce. They tasted fresh and flavorful.   The pho arrived shortly after that. Their portion is rather large so make sure you go hungry. It was accompanied by a plate filled with sides (sprouts, cilantro, limes, jalapenos, mint). The meat was tender, the noodles were perfect and the broth beyond amazing.   Everyone at the place was extremely friendly and polite. Overall, the atmosphere was just as great as the food. If you're looking for great food for a great price and very friendly people, I would definitely recommend 43rd Express."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best pho soup ever! We come here all the time and totally recommended!! #15 was bomb!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have never experienced such a hostile service experience. I have eaten the food before many times and enjoyed it every time. However, I have always gotten my food to go. This particular time I was going to dine in with my family of 8. I was greeted by the manager and she obviously had an pre-conceived opinion at first sight as she spoke to us in the most condescending manner. I felt so insulted that I decided not to dine in rather order to go. She continued to belittle my inquiries regarding the menu until I finally asked her why she is so rude. She raised her voice and demanded we leave. My family was so insulted. As a mother, wife, and professional I chose not to engage and left. I'm sad that my children and disabled uncle had to experience such an injustice."}
{"text":"Literally the best pho I've ever had. Chicken broth seasoned to perfection with veggies and shrimp!!!  the best part of the meal was the taro macaroon with cookies and cream ice cream sandwich! The service was amazing hands down one of the best Vietnamese restaurants I've been to!"}
{"text":"BEST PHO YOU'LL FIND IN THE PHX AREA. Broth flavor is on point!! Start off with the number 1, you can't go wrong. They give you a lot of meat, and noodles compared to other Vietnamese restaurants, and also a good helping of the basil and bean sprouts.. AND they're are also reasonably priced! This is a very small \"hole in the wall\" place but that's when you know it's legit, so don't expect a fancy place here. Some of the guys that work there are so down to earth and talkative, love their friendliness and customer service. My husband and I are HOOKED.. also you macaroon lovers, they make the best homemade macaroons, also less expensive than other places."}
{"text":"Delicious Vietnamese cuisine.  Can honestly say, other than my Vietnamese Comadre,  I hsve not tasted better food.  The Banh Xeo is to die for.  What a treat to eat such flavorful Healthy food.   Pho is the most flavorful and hearty comfort food ,  Do yourself a favor and treat your taste buds to a little bit of heaven!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and owners. We were in town from Cleveland just looking for a good local spot to eat and per the other yelp reviews we tried it.   Spring rolls, vermicelli, and pho with brisket and steak were incredible. So fresh and flavorful.   To top it off we had their homemade macaroons and macaroon ice cream sandwich.   We will go out of our way to stop here when we come back to Arizona. Great family owned business - so welcoming."}
{"text":"Don't get scared by the outside presence! I got the shrimp and my boyfriend got the shrimp and beef pho. Both were amazing! The macaroons are sooo good and I'm very particular about my macaroons! This will go down as one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"The service was great! They were very attentive and friendly! We only came in for macaron ice cream sandwiches which were only $3.00 per sandwich. I had a Red Velvet macaron cookie with butter pecan ice cream. It could just be me, but I didn't find the macaron ice cream sandwich as amazing.... The ice cream was good, but I feel like I could have gotten the ice cream from my local grocery store and the macaron cookie was too sweet (this is coming from someone who has a very \"sweet tooth\").   I ordered their BBQ pork with rice and an egg on top. Yummy yummy yummy! There aren't many places that makes good BBQ pork, but this one sure does!"}
{"text":"second time back here it just gets better very fast service and free beverage with Yelp checkin.. ahh man and the smell of the spices and food are heavenly when you first come in.. still no room for the macaroons though!"}
{"text":"Great little place. Homey and yummy. Not fancy but really tasty and the friendly staff really wanted to make this beginner to Vietnamese food into a convert."}
{"text":"Pho is solid. Got a #2 and no complaints. #2 is a regular bowl while #1 is a larger and there's even a special larger bowl! Crazy, #2 totally filled me up. If you've never had pho, try this place, it's a great representation of how good pho can taste and I live next to Little Saigon in the OC so I really know my pho. Oh yeah, I'm Vietnamese too."}
{"text":"Food was good, enjoyed the experience.. will say that my tolerance for clove isn't that strong and it was extremely overpowering.. all in all good time!"}
{"text":"I don't have much to compare this place to because I haven't been to many Pho or Vietnamese restaurants but I can say I'm pretty sure I've eaten the best Pho of my life here at PHO 43.  I've never been here and everything sounds so good on the menu, I was torn.  I asked the kind lady behind the counter which one was her favorite, she said Number 10. So that's what I went with. It was hands down, love at first taste!  The flavors were insanely good.  It was served piping hot and brought to my table within 5 minutes of sitting down.  5 minutes Yall!  This place gets crowded!  I walked in and there were no seats available at all.  I told the lady I wanted to dine in but it's packed so I'll order to go.  She said someone will be getting up in a few minutes I'm sure.  She started to take my order and before she could ask me if I wanted to add a drink, she looked up and noticed 2 women getting up.  I was happy I got to dine in because I wanted the entire experience.  It was a rotating door with hungry and happy customers.    When I got up to pay I saw them bringing out 4 Thai teas to 2 different tables. I said that much be delicious.  The lady said it is.  So I took her advice again and ordered one.  So glad I did!  I live to far to dine here all the time but when in the area I'm definitely heading back to PHO 43. It's the best!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! The have yummy macaroons with ice cream! They are all very nice and service is great!"}
{"text":"Great food for a low low price, be sure to check in for a free drink. The flavors were on spot! Never had a more flavorful bowl of soup that comes with the rice dish. Some issues was the rice plate is a bit small compared to other places and they don't actually have broken rice. Also save some room for their fresh macaron ice cream sandwich, perfectly made! It's a shame they're located all the way in phoenix."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pho places! Their Thai tea is so good and their pho is amazing. They also have macaroon ice cream on certain days that is super delicious. I think the price is really fair and I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Incredible spring rolls and Macaroons! We ordered a variety of macaroons and ordered two macaroon ice-cream sandwiches and they were the bomb! The flavored in the macaroons and the spring rolls were unique and were exactly what we were looking for! It exceeded our expectations! Don't let the outside of the restaurant fool you it is more than worth the stop in! I wish we would have been able to sit down instead of being on the run!"}
{"text":"Just got back from a Saturday night dinner at 43rd Express.  Made a long trip to get there but with these kinds of Yelp reviews, I couldn't help myself.  Place is a humble restaurant in that it is clean, but nothing to look at.  You know how I feel.  I don't eat decor; I eat food. Had the spring rolls as appetizers but instead of the shrimp, pork, etc I decided to have them made with just TOFU.  Three very large, fresh rolls that were really good.  Ordered the rare beef/brisket PHO which came in a large bowl with an ULTRA HUGE portion of the greens that you put in the soup--meaning basil leaves, cilantro, peppermint, jalapeños, lime slices and fresh bean sprouts.  Enough for two soups.   What a delicious broth!  Rare beef was indeed rare and delicate as it was sliced thin.  5 stars on the pho. Also had chicken fried rice which I was curious about--Vietnamese fried rice??? Hmmmm.......   Arrived with lots of veggies in it along with the chicken.  Good flavor.  Nicely prepared--not greasy.  Why is chinese fried rice so greasy sometimes?  Take note.   I ordered the half order of the crepe stuffed with shrimp and pork.  I think it's 38A on the menu.  Very good except I think it needed more salt.  I added soy sauce and it was fine.   This place has a dessert menu that includes Maccarons.... no, not Macaroons made of coconut.  Maccarons are small, light , flavored \"cookies\" which are a specialty of French bakeries.  Not surprising that a Vietnamese restaurant would carry these.  After all the French did occupy Vietnam thereby influencing its cuisine.  (e.g. the crepe).  I wanted to taste just one and chose the pistachio flavor.  It arrived a bluish-green color.  I expected the usual light green color.  I tasted it and while it was delicate (it is made of egg whites), it did not have any pistachio flavor.   Basically, they were nothing special.  But I think it may be unfair of me to assess these Macarons since I have eaten many, many of them in France where they masterfully create these bits of deliciousness.  Paris bakers are the king and queens of making macarons so I cannot expect a restaurant on 43rd Avenue in Phoenix to even begin to compete.  No need to. I came for great Vietnamese food and I got it."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! I LOVE coming here on Friday as they have the macaroons and most of them are available! The food is great as well. The first time we went there the owners took the time to come and introduce themselves and ask us how we enjoyed our meal. It feels like home coming to eat at this place. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"This review is not for the pho here, it's for the macaroon ice-cream sandwiches!! Yes, you read that right!! They make them right there in the restaurant and they are DELICIOUS! I discovered this little gem about two years ago & shared it with a foodie blogger on Instagram and she posted about them and they've been getting great attention since. (Not to say it's thanks to me but.. ya know ;)) Not a great area and also very small inside the restaurant but it is WORTH IT! Check out the photos I've posted."}
{"text":"One of the best, authentic pho places in the Phoenix area!  I think many pho restaurants in Phoenix try to make the dish look dainty and pretty by not loading the bowl with all the great garnishes it's supposed to have. 43rd Express doesn't skimp on their meat, the veggies, the garnish, and have very friendly staff. Price is very reasonable too. I highly advise people to call in ahead of time to check their hours, as this appears to be a family business, and we've seen on multiple occasions where customers are turned away because they had to close early.   Oh and their ice cream macarons are amazing. No matter how full you are, definitely try to squeeze this one in because it'll be worth it."}
{"text":"Me and my daughter wanted some Pho so she picked 43rd Express.Well she saw the pictures of macarons.By the way they are amazing.The Pho was wonderful the spring rolls were just so fresh.This is a must try if you never tried Vietnamese food or love it a great place to eat.The guys that work there are very helpful.Small place but cute and reasonable."}
{"text":"Great food I love this place I've been gone to this place for a long time taste always the same . And affordable prices"}
{"text":"Working in this part of town, it's sometimes hard to find quick places that aren't one of the -berto's fast food chains. So glad I was able to find this place. It's pretty much the definition of hole-in-the-wall: it's in what looks like a former KFC and the parking lot is a disaster. I'm not Vietnamese, so I can't speak to the authenticity, but every entree I've gotten here I've enjoyed. The spring rolls weren't my favorite--they felt a little dry for some reason (even with the dipping sauce).   I happened to be there on a weekend and got the macaron ice cream sandwiches. Also fantastic--only tough thing was that the ice cream was so tall, I couldn't really eat the whole thing at once (not that that stopped me from trying)."}
{"text":"This place is the beezneese! Best pha in town. Always reasonably priced. And as long as you save room, the macaroons and macaroon ice cream sandwiches while they last are the best kept secret in town!"}
{"text":"Don't expect anything fancy from this place, but when you walk in you know you're going to get good food. Actually, the macarons were pretty fancy ;) We started with the summer rolls, which were packed full. The sauce that comes with it was amazing- not too sweet and not too peanut-y like some places. We each ordered a bowl of pho. The broth was smooth and the meat plentiful. Now to the best part- the MACARONS. I've had many macarons both good and bad and these were primarily why I wanted to come here. I saw their macaron ice cream sandwiches and knew I had to try. In my opinion I think these are way better than a certain shop in LA (that I won't name) where I waited in line for 45 minutes... Had the taro cookie with pandan ice cream. The cookie is so chewy and the taro flavor really comes out. Left home with a box of macarons and every weekend I want more.."}
{"text":"Pho was great as were the eggrolls. Finished off the meal with some Macaroons which were really good.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Seriously, best Pho I've had in this city. Price, taste, portion, all hit the mark. Their fried rolls are also the best I've had, I could eat a whole plate of them. They also make awesome macaroons, and ice cream sandwiches, out of this world. 3 people, 1 xtra large bowl of Pho, 2x orders of fried rolls, 1 ice cream sandwich, 6 macaroons,  under 30.00 with tip. The macaroons cost around 3.00 each anywhere else I've been"}
{"text":"I am rating this restaurant based off the macaroons... seriously the best I have ever had in Phoenix HANDS DOWN. I have had macaroons from many reputable bake shops in the valley and trust me nothing ever in life tops Pho 43 macaroons. They are fresh, SOFT and full of flavor!!!!"}
{"text":"Yes! This place was awesome! It is hard to find great asian food in Phoenix but this place does it right. They had fantastic Vietnamese crepes and macarons. If you check in on yelp you get a free drink that is good for up to $4. This place is a great deal. A hearty meal for two is under $30."}
{"text":"So delicious. Favorite pho place in az. Super nice staff. The broth is super yummy. And overall I super love this place. The end."}
{"text":"So, so good! The spring rolls are INCREDIBLE! The macarons are delicious too and they look so beautiful. They are also half the price of others. I don't live very close to here, but I make an effort to do things in this area just so that I can stop by and eat here. I love that it's family owned too!"}
{"text":"Never had Vietnamese before stopping in this place. I'm a regular now, and it set the bar extremely high. I've stopped for Vietnamese closer to home thinking it would compare...so far nothing does. Great prices too."}
{"text":"Nice homie environment and pho broth is on point! The go to spot near home. Small location but packed with flavor!"}
{"text":"Good food, good price & fresh ingredients. I would definitely recommend and will probably come back.  However the staff is selectively friendly and attentive. I have a preferred Vietnamese restaurant where me, my friends, and family are treated better."}
{"text":"The only thing better than this pho are the Golden State Warriors beating the Cleveland Cavs in the Finals.  That's the Dellavedova I know."}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall type restaurant, seat about 40-50 people. Price is very reasonable. $7.25 for extra large special combo pho!! Try The beef pho it is excellent!! Only $6.50!! The been sprouts and garnishing are fresh. Ask for the extra large bowl!!"}
{"text":"The pho was great. But the macaroons are the BOMB! Only had the cookies and cream but it was delicious!"}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite Pho spot in town, it's always great and filling. Fresh food, and the customer service is good you won't sit around waiting for service. Make sure you leave some room for a macaroon after your meal, it's a must when eating here!"}
{"text":"I loved their service! When i came in they were  very attentive to help in any way they could, the coffee was decent , i felt like they mixed Thai with vietnamese food. When i was eating my soup, the pork was undercooked.   The ice-cream sandwiches are amazing!!"}
{"text":"Love this hidden Vietnamese gem. The food is good and it hits the spot. I will definitely go back"}
{"text":"A bit of a hole in the wall, but when you show up at noon on a Saturday and the parking lot is packed, that's a great sign. The staff was friendly with a surprisingly hipster vibe - it was pretty neat to see a younger set running the place. It had that \"mom you're such a good cook let's open a restaurant and my brothers and sisters and I will run the place\" kind of feel.   I had the pho - the broth was so flavorful with that authentic taste. The crepe was also good and of course we just had to try one of their famous macaron ice cream sandwiches. Yummy!!  I also had the iced ca phe and they made it to order right in front of me. In all my years of eating Vietnamese they've always made it in the kitchen so it was cool to see (and taste!) it freshly made.   I will definitely be back the next time we visit Phoenix. Baby LOVES her noodles and I'm slowly convincing hubs how delicious it is. :)"}
{"text":"BEST PHO IN TOWN. Hands down. I've eaten at pretty much all the known Pho restaurants in the valley and nothing compares to theirs. No other place has broth that is as flavorful.  Another thing is that I always get soy bean milk with my meals and it's great here and it's homemade! (None of that canned drink business.) Also, service is great and the staff is super friendly.. and I think one of them is a major Lebron fan so some of you out there might be in for some great conversations. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I will start by saying the food at this establishment is by far the best in Phoenix. Unfortunately their customer service is by far the worst. Unless you plan on being at this restaurant 2-3 hours before they close do not count them having what you want. My spouse and I travel 30 minutes in 5:30 traffic (and haul ass) just to get there 2-3 hours before they close, and they on countless occasions tell us they have run out. Talking with one of the staff members about this issue, I've learned they only make one pot of broth per day. Here's a really great business tip, BUY ANOTHER GOD DAMN POT! Moving forward in examples, my father in law, to avoid disturbing another guest, grabbed a sriracha from a different table, and was told by the owner \"what's wrong you don't know how to share?\" Now let's be honest a restaurant that brings in plenty of revenue (from their one pot) should have a setting for every table. Again moving forward. You can't even ask for a fucking fork with out feeling the heat from a dragon like huff and puff! 43rd express is again the best pho in Phoenix, unfortunately because of their vile customer service I won't wast my gas time or money on this establishment. I strongly suggest the employees research a local seminar on customer service, myself and I assure you many others, think that it will be to your utmost benefit! Thank you.    P.S we have found another pho location in the Peoria area and thankfully they have more than one pot."}
{"text":"It a good place to eat at, I'm eating vegetarian meals now a days and my selection is very limited, the customer service from the guys in there are superb with the exception of the young kid, don't get me wrong he doesn't lack customer service, he is just too shy and speaks too low.. But I know he will be better... Lol.. But the in law guy and the tall one in the register were super nice, helpful, and eager to talk to us. Totally coming back!! Also macaroons were great!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for really good Viet food this is the spot! Outside it looks really ghetto, but some of the best places look like a dive. My boyfriend and I ordered pho and some mi kho. I'm picky about my pho, but this was the best pho I've had in awhile. Boyfriend thought the mi kho was a bit too oily, but he finished most of his. Their cafe sua da was bomb also! And to top it off we got both our macaron ice creams for free courtesy of our server. Awesome food and bomb service!! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"wow! the pho, bun, spring rolls are really delicious here. but the MVP of the menu is the macaron ice cream sandwiches. a very nice finisher to a spicy/salty dish. the coconut vanilla with pandan macaron is a nice combo. worth the drive."}
{"text":"Best pho spot in PHX for pho.  Tried a few places and this one is most legit.  It seemed to be in a really hood area.  The service was great. Some giant asian dudes serving some giant pho bowls.  They probably played football or something and their magical pho powered them.  The egg rolls were quite favorful.  Love the rice meat egg dish as well."}
{"text":"From outside it look like a dive, an old Taco Bell once you set aside low maintenance low overhead, rices are moderate and the PHO is on point.  My girlfriend and I wanted something light but satisfying for dinner especially on this hot day, perfect spot for what we needed. Make sure to call ahead to make sure they are open.  Don't sleep on this place. Hidden Gem."}
{"text":"So, I wish I can rate different dishes at this place seperatly. Let start with positive one: macaroon & macaroon icecream.  Very tasty,  but they ran out of most flavors.  Their food is a big NO. I used to live in little saigon,  so I have high expectation for vietnamese foods. But, sorry to say, their food is not even close to standard.  I saw some reviews that screamed out for Bun Bo Hue aka spicy beef noodles, so we tried.  Huge mistake; it looks like a good one but tastes nothing like one. It's a double No for me.   Pho and rice dishes are maybe/no. Maybe for people who are craving for pho  and have nowhere else to go;  No for people just want to get some good food. I would love to give more stars for their macaroon,  but I'm  too disappointed."}
{"text":"I come here regularly and I can say I've had almost everything on their menu and it's all delicious. Just recently I found they had Thai tea and it's DELICIOUS! I recommend getting it.   If you want something sweet as well you need to get their macarons and their macaron ice cream sandwiches. As like everything else in this family owned establishment, the macarons are made by one of the sisters named Binh. She's a wizard at baked goods and she takes orders for parties or anything you want. She can custom make the macarons as well. It's pretty awesome.   Only place I go to eat pho, period.   Egg rolls are awesome, they have springs rolls 2 ways which I like the bbq pork version but they have the traditional ones as well.   If you have never tried it or wondered what it is you gotta try the Bánh xèo which looks like a crepe but it's dericious. Yes I said DERICIOUS!   Bun bo hue is flavorful and on point.   Pork, chicken rice plates are awesome as well, I always get 2 eggs cause #ilovegg  Basically try something new when you come nothing has disappointed me once. This place is affordable and offers free parking as well ."}
{"text":"Pho was good. Good service. Macarons by Binh are a must have there on the weekends!! Happy tummy!"}
{"text":"My sister and I came in and every single table and chair was occupied. Dates singles families, etc. it seemed everyone and their mother was out for pho. But we were quickly greeted and as soon as a table freed up, it was bussed by a young gentlemen.   We ordered two types of steak pho and shrimp rolls. I'm new to the world of pho but I knew this place is something unique.   The guy who greeted us, seated us and bussed and served, as well as wrapped all of our stuff to go turned out to be the son of the business owner. He told us the history of the restaurant and offered to let us try macaroons and even gave us some to take home free of charge. He asked if we had saved any room, he would bring over an ice cream sandwich.   I can't believe it took so long for me to come here but I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Macaroons on point! We took a ton home and had the macaroon ice cream sandwiches which were also to die for.. my favorite part and good priced! The food was pretty good as well very different. Next time I will order the pho and see what the rage is about!"}
{"text":"This place is a dive, so understand that first and foremost. I love the staff they are hella friendly. It is a small restaurant and small dining area but you can order carry out if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"Really fun experience :) My friend and I went there and the main thing I came for was the macaron ice cream. It did not disappoint. The spring rolls were pretty good. My friend got the bun Bo hue and she said it was a bit greasy. The waiter made it a fun experience by asking us to take a Polaroid for the wall. Overall had fun and had a great dessert."}
{"text":"We live in the East Valley, and we still managed to enjoy some of that Pandan & Taro macaron ice cream, and their yummy pho.  It's a hole in a wall. Please don't expect a host, or banquette seating (booth), or dining al fresca. It's pretty straight forward - occupy an empty clean table, place your order, and wait. :) They get a bit busy especially during lunch hour, and close to dinner. Bring your patience.  Though I must say, some of the servers have been quite rude when we asked for assistance - refill on water, asking for the menu, asking to clean our table cause it's still dirty etc."}
{"text":"Was planning on having lunch here with my girl but the place is so tiny and was so busy we decided to just order some ice cream macaroon sandwiches and eat them while we drove to our usual pho restaurant. I ordered the taro ice cream with taro macaroon and it was the best sweet I had in a long time, I love anything taro and they definitely have that flavor down. My girl ordered a red velvet macaroon with strawberry ice cream and she too enjoyed hers. Currently they only offer the macaroon sandwiches Friday through Sunday which is a shame because I would drive here every night for some dessert."}
{"text":"First off their customer service is so amazing! Hands down, blew me out the water. David is super nice and friendly and took his time answering questions and giving suggestions, even gave us a brief history of the place. Family owned and operated! The place was packed when we got there but only had to wait a min of so (go before the lunch crowd) The Pho was amazing of course! Got some too go! #49 #3 and spring rolls ! Yum"}
{"text":"Best Pho in AZ! Great prices, Food comes out fast, staff is friendly and attentive to needs. Would highly recommend Pho 43rd Express. I would also recommend trying the French macaroons that they sell on the weekends.. Best ones I've had since moving here to AZ."}
{"text":"Awesome spot. The wait staff was incredibly friendly and helpful in explaining the menu options. The food is very flavorful and so delicious. We will definitely make the trip back to eat here"}
{"text":"Pho 43 hit the spot. Do not be sketched out by the appearance from the outside. This is a prime example of why the architecture does not equate to quality. This is a family-owned establishment. The brothers and sisters run this restaurant with the highest quality of service. At arrival, there is an entire team to give the biggest welcome. Waiters and waitresses were speedy to take the orders and bring out our meals.   I had to satisfy my caffeine crave, so I got the Vietnamese ice coffee. If you haven't had Vietnamese coffee, the coffee came in a coffee press and filter that drains into a cup with condensed milk. Once completed, you stir and pour the coffee into a cup full of ice.   We had ordered the spring rolls for appetizers. These large spring rolls were filled with the freshest vegetables and meat. It came with a flavorful Vietnamese peanut sauce to perfectly compliment.   I had the #10 Tai Chin, Pho with steak and brisket. The dish comes out in a large bowl with noodles, meat, pho, and broth that filled to the rim. On the side, they supply plenty of sprouts and basils for you to add on your own. They also had all the essential sauces on the table that you would need to eat pho -hoisin sauce (my favorite), sriracha, and chili. Steak and brisket were prepared in thin slices, tender in texture. The broth quenched my savory tooth.   If you have a sweet tooth, you better save room for dessert. The macaroons comes in different flavors and you can pick different kinds of ice cream with it. We ordered the taro macaroon with cookies and cream ice cream. Let's just say they're worth your calories. Note: The Macaroons are only sold on Friday, Saturdays, and Sundays because they're own by a separate vendor.   Go ahead and consider me a regular to Pho 43 now. I am convinced that I have found the best Vietnamese Restuarant in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I've seen it a few times but was kind of skeptical to try it. Guess you won't know until you do so. It was a cold day perfect for Pho but I ordered something else. I ordered the vermicelli noodles and BBQ pork plate. Mom's Pho was super tasty and you've gotta try the egg rolls. Amazing! And their staff are super friendly. Definitely planning on returning to this place."}
{"text":"This place was great. They deserve all the stars. The food was amazing, the portions were Texas inspired, and the prices made me feel like I was stealing something. The neighborhood is a little sketchy, but when I saw the parking lot was full of locals, I gave it a shot and I'm glad I did. I pointed to some man's pho and said that's what I wanted, and it was freakin awesome. The staff: Simply. The. Best. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. I have been going there for over 10 years. Lately, the food is not as good. The Pho has little meat compared to others, and they charge extra for meatballs, when they have them. They never have mint, and on more than one occasion I have seen a roach on the wall. I hate to say it, but I stopped going when they started cutting back.I"}
{"text":"My favorite pho place the pho is great!! They also sell macarons!! Customer service is great it's family owned. Great people! This is a place u must come to! It's the only place around here I think. The pho is authentic!"}
{"text":"So it's weird but we didn't go here for the pho. We went for the macaroons! The people are so nice and so so so helpful. They macaroons were beautiful and taste amazing!"}
{"text":"We are hooked! We have been back 3 times and each time is 5 stars. We can pretty much throw a dart at the menu and trust that whatever it lands on, it will be good. Their macaroons are better than the ones in the Ritz Carlton. If anyone makes a better macaroon than Binh, I would like to try it. :)"}
{"text":"Super generous portion and plate of sprouts etc. Place is very affordable. Lunch specials are great at $5. The place is really good as well. I order the pho and a vermicelli dish. The pho had very little meat two pieces of meatball and three pieces of the thin steak. On the other hand the vermicelli dish had a normal amount of meat and so did my rice plate. I got a to go order of egg noodles and the cashier gave me the wrong order and by the time I checked I was at home! A little disappointed but the waiter and staff are prompt. The place is a little dirty and far for me. There was lots of parking and I got to use an amazon deal, don't know if I will come back a little far, I'll still stick with Pho Doung for sure and near me!"}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing! Great friendly service and amazing food! This has easily become my go to place for Pho!   If you want happy taste buds bring your mouth here!"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food ever. I'm so glad my boss recommended this place. It's a small mom and pop shop but their pho, rice dishes and macaroon ice cream sanwhiches are delicious. I am a total regular. Everyone is super friendly. I even call in my orders to go and my order is ready in 10 mins."}
{"text":"So far, one of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants....It's a hole in the wall.....I love love this place!!! I love the pho, their portions are huge,  I can never finish it. They have the best macaroon ice cream sandwiches so whenever i come I have to have dessert! Everything is so nice, crispy and fresh, you won't be disappointed. Their customer service isn't the greatest, I've been here twice and they're not very enthusiastic at all, they just come up to you and take your order.... I'm all about customer service so when I'm ordering i expect the waiter or waitress to at least be happy to see you. But I'm such a big kid at heart so I'm always happy to be there with my big smile : ) to get my pho fix lol..... I guess they're just really serious people : ) anyways i still give them a nice tip bc i love love their food!"}
{"text":"Once again a Pho place earns a 5!!! I love my Pho and this place don't disappoint. From food to Service this place delivers. Fragrant broth with a depth of flavor, a plate piled with sides, plenty of meat. My 6 year old was with us and they even made a small bowl for her. Earns big points with mommy lol. This place filled up fast so I would say is a local favorite place."}
{"text":"Nothing about this place is disappointing, staff is friendly and helpful and the food is to die for! Everything i've had here is really tasty and authentic including their macarons and macaron ice cream sandwiches. I bring everyone i can here :)"}
{"text":"Macaroon Ice Cream Sandwiches, yum! This place is worth the trip. They made homemade ice-cream and macaroons on the weekends. My kids and I just come for these sweet confections on a hot Arizona Day. I personally love Taro Macaroons with Taro Ice Cream."}
{"text":"Pho 43 is the best authentic Vietnamese restaurant ever! They have been around for years and was one of the first Vietnamese restaurants that opened up in Phoenix, Arizona. They recently started gaining more attention for introducing macarons and macaron ice cream sandwiches (only available on weekends) onto their dessert menu. It's a must have if you aren't too full from your appetizers and entrees! In my opinion, they have some of the best noodle soup entrees compared to other Vietnamese restaurants! My favorite dishes are bun bo hue (spicy beef noodle soup), banh xeo (Vietnamese crepe), and any of the vermicelli dishes!"}
{"text":"I love this place, we are here  at lest 3 times a month.  My husband on the other hand is here twice a week.  He loves the beef Pho and I love the pork and egg roll vermicelli #44 with a Thai tea . We usually get a side of egg rolls or a side of the shrimp spring rolls. With your Pho you get a side of fresh herbs: bean sprouts, thai basil, jalapeños, mint and limes. And for desert you have to try the macaroon ice cream sandwiches they have a rainbow of flavores  you can mix match the cookie with the ice cream as you wish. (Beware they do ask that you pay for the macaroon ice cream sandwich separate from the food). These items are our favorites but their menu has a bigger verity of Pho, vermicelli and rice plates. The building is an old and small building but its clean and the environment is casual. It's family own and operated so it feels homey.  The customer service is great if you have any questions just ask."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best Pho in Phoenix. The broth has a great flavor, and the Thai iced tea (not on the menu, but ask for it) was the perfect amount of sweetness. Plus, the service was great. I'd rate it higher if I could!"}
{"text":"I am not crazy about Pho, especially considering they aren't very accommodating to me being vegetarian, but oh man they're great. 43rd Express is the definition of a hole in the wall place, the neighbourhood is far beyond suburban, but all the more adds to it's appeal of surprising the heck out of you. The family that owns the restaurant treated me and my family likes their family for our first time. They even messed up on my vietnamese coffee and gave me another one for free, they even gave us a few macaroons we were curious what they tasted like for free! They claimed, those ones were \"broken\" ha, sure. Anyways, the food was great, flavourful, and made with great ingredients. I am coming back."}
{"text":"Definitely the best pho I've had in Arizona. Broth is flavorful and everything is very authentic. Pho tai ($6.50) is a good classic dish to order. My sister ordered the pho dac biet ($6.75) which includes steak and tripe (intestinal lining). We agreed that the pho here was really bomb and that we'd gladly return. The restaurant is kind of a hole-in-the-wall in a semi-sketchy area, but the food is well worth it.  I also ordered 6 macarons because I was tempted by all the yelp pictures. They are $1.50 and larger than macarons sold at other places. They were delicious and very pretty to look at.   I highly recommend this restaurant. The food is delicious and prices are very reasonable.  TIP: Free drink with yelp check-in!"}
{"text":"I feel really bad for writing this review because the people who work here are super friendly and down-to-earth. Unfortunately, the food is not good and that's ultimately what it comes down to. Pho was way too sweet, which overshadowed the complex aromatics of a truly good broth. Bun bo hue was pretty awful. Tasted like fish-sauce water. Grilled pork on the vermicelli dish was wafer thin and dry. And they use a lot of coloring on their meats which makes the food look less appealing. Banh xeo had nice crunch but only had a few small shrimps inside and I don't remember seeing any pork at all. Vegetable accompaniments were each lacking something authentic to the dish. I did not try any of the macarons, but we were given crepe samples which were ok. Free drink with yelp check-in if you want to try some new drinks. I might come back to try a macaron, but not for the Viet food. Hate to be a food snob at a mom-and-pop place, but as Vietnamese food becomes increasingly popular, I'd want people to experience the real deal."}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall. My niece goes there regularly  so we decided to try it . The staff was not that friendly. Prices are reasonable.  We tried their pro with steak and brisket . The portion  was large but the soup did not have much flavor. The meat was very fatty and not much meat. Also tried their fried rice . It was oily and the pork was overcooked.  We did like their  desert macro on with ice cream. Food came quickly."}
{"text":"We ordered an appetizer and 2 main dishes.  We specified that we wanted to eat the appetizer first.  The waitress brought all dishes at once.  When I asked her the reason she did not serve the appetizer first she replied that the kitchen was responsible.  I told her that we were not happy because our main dishes were going to be cold. The owner of the restaurant came to our table, told us that was not the proper way to talk to the waitress.  When I wanted to reply, he raised his voice and came aggressively close to me.  His voice was so loud that everybody stopped talking. Their food is good but not superior to any other local Vietnamese restaurants.  We definitively do not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Walked in and this place was so busy and there was a line forming outside already. Although, we got seated about after 10 minutes of waiting. Our sever was very nice and chill at first but it got really busy and it seems like he was the only sever putting in effort because I saw him mainly taking orders...   Spring rolls came out first and it looked pretty good. But that first bite I took, I tasted nothing but veggies and cold vermicelli noodles. The peanut sauce was salty..sorry Pho 43... I wouldn't order it again.   My friend and I both got their Pho size medium with Steak, Brisket, and Meatballs. The pho came out and it smell so good, but the broth was too fatty. It tasted pretty good but the broth was so fatty it kinda gross me out after 4 bites it felt like they pour oil in the soup... the meat portion of the pho was just basic, nothing special.   I also order egg rolls but that came out after the entree.. I reminded the server about my egg rolls that I order for appetizer and he didn't apologize but just said \"its coming out, we got backed up.\" I felt like everything was rushed and our table barely got the attention we needed.   Also the menu was so sticky, and out of order.. it had stains and was all ripped up...   I would definitely give this place another time but not for awhile..."}
{"text":"So delicious here , i always get the fried rice with pork and fried egg ,! Damm they know how to keep a customer happy af , i would recommend it to anybody if they want to try something new"}
{"text":"This restaurant looks like it's been there forever, in a neighborhood that's not too pretty. But the food is great, the service is fast and friendly, and the prices are low. I had my usual favorites for trying out Vietnamese restaurants: pho wth rare beef and brisket, and banh xeo. Both came in generous portions. The pho was aromatic and very tasty, and the banh xeo was crispy and bursting with beansprouts, pork, and shrimp. Definitely a place for return visits."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. Priced real low and huge portions. The staff is real down to earth and is family run with a few siblings. Quaint small place that if you don't know it is there, you'll miss it. I highly suggest it."}
{"text":"Small mom and pop shop. My rolls never showed and then tried charging me the matter was quickly resolved with apology and a small discount . Pho along with the sweets are good would come again."}
{"text":"If I could rate higher I WOULD!   Hole in the wall yes!!! Agreed! But if this isn't the definition of \"don't judge a book by its cover\" I don't know what is. Heard good things so gave it a try.    Location could be better but really who cares when it works and everyone leaves satisfied?   Customer service was phenomenal.  Was a bit busy but still felt like we were a priority. Atmosphere is great. Sort of like when you visit your friends family and they care of you like one of their own.    Price point is excellent I had left Over food and didn't spend that much.    Pho was great. Meat was delicious. Everyone was worth it.    HIGHLIGHT!!!!!!! macaroons And macaroon ice cream sandwiches. I would go out of my way just for this! TRUST ME and give them a try.   Couldn't have asked for a better experience.  Will surely recommend this to everyone and visit as much as I can."}
{"text":"I would send friends here and will come back soon enough. In fact I would drive out of my way to come here for their pho broth. Homemade beef broth with no bouillon!!! First time having shrimp in my Pho. It's not fancy decor, but who needs fancy when you have delicious!"}
{"text":"My fellow yelpers didn't let me down with this recommendation. This hole in the wall from the outside joint is legit.    I hadn't had pho in like months.  Since the weather \"cooled down\" a bit recently.  Now was the right time to find an A+ spot for Pho in PHO-enix.  Pho 43 is one of those spots that's not in some pretty strip mall but in an area I was told is not the safest at night.  I suspect this place is jam packed on the weekends, but I swooped by on a weekday!  So therefore service was never an issue.  Michael who ran the place when I ate there, checked in a few times and was chill.     I could smell the broth as soon I walked in.  Cue the angels singing.  Everything looked great on the menu but I came for what I like to refer to as the Super Burrito of Vietnamese cuisine!  The Pho Dac Biet Xe Lua.  Holy sh*t, I even saw they have a Super Duper size option!  Daaaayum!    I just stuck to their \"XL size\" and when it arrived to the table...the soup was filled to the top rim of the bowl.  Like seriously one wrong move and that piping hot soup would've spilled over.  These folks at Pho 43 are dangerous AND I like that!    Broth is great just the perfect amount of star anise and seasoning , generous chunks of brisket were on point as well.  My only regret is that I forgot to ask for the rare sliced beef on the side.  I like to throw those in the broth once it comes out but luckily they weren't well done thankfully.    Quality and quantity.  Best of both worlds.  Overall an outstanding bowl of pho.  Next time it will be bun or banh xeo AND macaroons on a weekend trip back to the 4 3."}
{"text":"Great price and great food! Love this little gem we found in Phx. Their pho is super good- the comfort food that you just want after a long day. We also ordered Thai iced tea and their egg rolls which were also great. Then the best part would be their ice cream macarons! The pandas macaron is so delicious and we cannot wait to come back for some more. The price range is so reasonable, it's hard to beat."}
{"text":"This is just the best pho in Phoenix...worth the 30 minutes drive I have to do. The place is small but clean, staff is great and the broth is one of the best I ever had."}
{"text":"This is by far the best pho place in the valley, ive been to a few around town, and the food and prices are the best i have found. I only gave 4 stars because the service was excellent but could use some improvement on their attention to water levels. Other than that 5/5 great portions, great prices, great taste and atmoaphere"}
{"text":"First time ever here and already impressed. The sincere and amazing customer attention from the owners was surprisingly nice. Food tasted fresh and clean, not heavy. Had the Spring rolls and #45. Wanted to try the famous macaroons they seem to be well-known for, but they were sold out already. (The macaroons only sell Friday through Sunday). Will go back and try more menu items for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great Pho!! It's a small and busy place but they get food out quickly and hot! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Let me warn you about this place. I ordered a $6.50 Pho and bill was $8.24. With 10% sales tax it should be $7.15.  I thought maybe I made a mistake so I went back a year later & they overcharged again 20%.  I asked for receipt and copy of menu and they said they are out of menus and they will email me receipt. How are they going to email me receipt if they do no have my my email address? The spring rolls are cold, straight out of refrigerator. The Pho is good though.  Bunch of crooks.  Eat here but do NOT leave tip!"}
{"text":"Best Effin place ever !!! I've been a loyal customer for about three years and let me tell you, they are always serving fresh ingredients and flavorful food. The Pho is to die for, (the Mexican equivalent to menudo) cures a hangover lol. Once they added the macaroons and macaroon cookies, I was there every weekend.  Plus it's a family owned business and are so warm, friendly and humble !!!   I just love it here !!!"}
{"text":"Astoundingly good. I've had pho in a bunch of different places through SoCal and now in Arizona, this is hands down the best pho you will find anywhere. Super friendly folks running the place. The macarons are also incredible. If you have the chance, GO HERE."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I was last here, but the food and the service is still excellent!   You can't go wrong with the combo pho with the spring rolls."}
{"text":"Great service from a family owned and operated local joint; it is small inside, but they get a lot of people in there, so come early for lunch.  They have good lunch specials and portions are large.  I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Wow. What a great place. The flavor of the Pho broth was awesome and by far the best I have had in the valley. Went on a Saturday at lunchtime and still was seated right away.  Really good service, the guys working there were really nice and did I mention the food????  Had Pho, egg rolls and a Vietnamese iced coffee.  I also ordered some macarons to take home.  Will definitely be back! Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"I can now see why a lot of my friends in Chandler and Tempe make the drive out to the West side just for 43rd Express.  My boyfriend and I came here a couple of months ago and we were starving.  The food was amazing and I ate it all up, but I wasn't entirely sure if it was just the hunger speaker or if my taste buds really were dancing. After our second visit last week, I can confirm that it really was my taste buds busting out the macarena,  Their noodles and meat slices are so fresh and tender.  There's nothing I can really compare it to.  It's just THAT GOOD. They also sell macarons and macaron ice cream sandwiches.  But be aware that it's limited on what they have available and their regular macarons are only available on the weekends.  I was craving an ice cream sandwhich and was sad for a split second when I read that wrong and thought that all macaron creations were only available on the weekends.  Boy was I lucky!  I attempted to share a small bite with my boyfriend, but of course boys never know what \"small\" means.  His bite ended up being half of my dessert!  Next time I'll have to order a second one so that it will be an even split, and even try out different flavors!"}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall spot, very unassuming from the street.. Walk in to a small dining area, that's full of customers... We were here for a small period of time, and people were consistently coming in to eat.. This was around 3pm...   My yelp elite cousin is a regular here... We had already eaten lunch, so just came for dessert.. Of course, I had to try their macaron ice cream sandwiches.. I was sad that there were no traditional macarons available since it was a weekday... Anyways.. My kid enjoyed a red velvet macaron with birthday cake ice cream rolled in fruity pebbles. I kept it Asian with taro macaron and pandan ice cream.. So yum! I've had macarons and macaron ice cream, everywhere.. First time with these flavors, yum, so good and with a nice taro/pandan flavor!... The macaron texture I thought was just a bit on the soft side.   I'd love to try their food the next time I'm in town...  Service was quick, straightforward, and friendly enough for such a small fast pace restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered combination pho and it tasted pretty good. Lots of flavor and plenty of meat. Fried eggrolls were good and taro macaroon ice cream sandwich (rocky road) was pretty good according to my wife. I've had better pho but good eats overall. I probably won't go out of my way to come here for pho but if I'm in the area then I would drop in."}
{"text":"Very good Pho(but not the best Broth, thats at UKs). I live the quantity and quality of the meat. I love tendon and its the best when they give you big chunks of tendon. Very friendly customer service and fast service when doing pick up."}
{"text":"Food is really good and served up quickly but the staff is not very nice or inviting. I get this is a get your food and go kind of place but geez may be a little hello, thank you, smile????? I've gone here now at least 5 times but decided the last time that I'm no longer coming back. Customer service speaks volumes and they just don't have it....."}
{"text":"We found Pho43 on yelp and decided to try it out. Read previous reviews and agree that the cover of this book would be a deterrent. Outside of building and parking lot is run down. Inside is ok and clean. Wait staff very friendly and attentive. It's July and our water glasses were never empty. The soup had great flavor. We had the steak and flank pho. Our only complaint is the meat was very fatty and sparce in amount that was edible. I would try the chicken next time.   Fried spring rolls were very good. All the veggies and herbs were fresh. I will definitely go again if in the area."}
{"text":"Read about 43rd Express when it popped up as the \"Review of the Day\" - the review indicated this was a Vietnamese Restaurant that also had Macarons, and that they also had Macaron ice cream sandwiches...that's an all around win, as the gals in the family love Macarons, and I'm an ice cream guy - and we all love Vietnamese food.  Showed up and were greeted and seated.  Everybody working there was very friendly.  Ordered dinner (I got my usual - bun with grilled pork and egg roll with a ca phe sua da, the gals ordered a crepe and a noodle bowl).  While we were waiting, I struck up a conversation with David about the Macarons.  We had a good time talking with him (the gals make Macarons at home, so process discussion, etc.).  Ordered one of everything to go, and 3 ice cream sandwich Macarons as dessert.  Back to the food - the bun was very good - everything was fresh and good (and not stingy with the pickled carrots, etc.).  My wife really liked her crepe, and my daughter dug the noodle bowl.  Good stuff!  Then, dessert - the ice cream sandwich Macaron options are 3 kinds of cookie, and 8 or 9 flavors of ice cream.  We each tried one of the cookie types (Taro, Pandin, and Red Velvet) and 3 types of ice cream (Taro, Pineapple/Coconut, and...I forgot).  They were all really great.  Great food.  Great people.  And...the only Vietnamese restaurant I've found that's open on Sunday (when you get a ca phe sua da hankerin' on Sunday).  Check them out!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The best pho I have had including restaurants in California that I have tried.   Service is excellent and the prices are extremely reasonable. I highly recommend the spring rolls and the #3 bowl."}
{"text":"I  am stuffed & happy I found this spot on yelp! What a gem. Ordered pho with rare steak & brisket, fried spring rolls, vermicelli pork plate & macaron ice cream sandwich (taro macaron) wow! Amazing. Love the owner David as well. His sister makes all the macarons. Try this spot you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Always great service and quality food every time. My family and I have been going to Pho 43 express for different periods of over 10 years and I'm glad that the food has been consistent each time! I always recommend to my friends"}
{"text":"I might have a macaron habit. But please, don't tell my addiction counselor.  OMG so much amazing happens in the 43rd express kitchen. The saying \"you don't know what you're missing\" comes to mind when I think of everyone who's not had one of their a macaron ice cream sandwich.  Never had the pleasure of experiencing Phoenix best macaron?, then get here, now. Unless that is, you've been here before, and if you've been here before and not had their macarons, I don't feel bad for you, I feel sorry. Sorry that you didn't order the best macaron you'll experience in Phoenix. With flavors like strawberry ice cream, taro ice cream, and Oreo cookie, the ice cream alone is delish, but they combine their home made ice cream with amazing macarons to form Ultron, defender of the universe. But seriously, it's a friggen macaron ice cream sandwich.   It's rare that I head west for anything gastronomically delightful but this is just one of those places. If death must find me west of central phoenix, let it find me at 43rd express with a fistful of macarons and a mouth full of ice cream sandwich!! :-)  Happy yelping!"}
{"text":"Never judge a book by its cover! My mom convinced me to give this place a try considering the already impressive reviews and I am so glad we did. When I pulled into the parking lot I thought to myself, \"I wonder if this will actually be any good\". When we walked in and every table was full (this was on a Monday at 1:30pm).  We ordered the spring rolls as an appetizer and Pho Ga for our meal. The pho was awesome!!! The best Pho I have had. After we ate we watched another costumer order a macaroon. Neither my mom or I have ever had a macaroon before so we thought we would give them a try. The waitress explained what flavors they had left and even let us \"Sample\" the Pandan (Green) and Taro (Purple). They were so good we ordered a few extra to take home.   If you are looking to try a good Pho restaurant look no further than 43rd Pho Express."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect but I had the fried rice with chicken, pork and shrimp and it was good. I could see myself getting addicted to the macaroons. All in all, I enjoyed it and will go back."}
{"text":"This a definitely hole in the wall! The food is awesome! Our server suggested that we try the fresh spring roll with bbq and that's a bomb. I never liked fresh spring rolls but this is an exception. Their pho is definitely the best in the valley. It's so flavorful! I didn't finish my pho so I took it home. It's still good the next day. I checked in and I had free drink! Too bad that they don't have fresh coconut when I went there so I tried the vietnamese coffee. It's on the strong side.  I love their macaron ice cream sandwiches! The flavors that I wanna try is not available so I settled on red velvet macaron with caramel ice cream! My husband tried the red velvet macaron with rocky road ice cream. Can't wait to go back and try more macarons!!!"}
{"text":"Visited from Cali, and wow is this place both cheap and delicious!!! We ordered their #1 upgraded size and it is huge! For just $4 extra, it's double the size and they do not skimp on the meat and tendons at all! Their broth is very good too, just like its homemade. It was so good, we even decided to order another one to go to take home. We wanted to try their spicy noodle soup ones, but they weren't ready for another 2 hours (we ate at 4pm) if we're ever visiting again, we will be sure to stop by!!!"}
{"text":"Best Pho in Phx!  And the French macarons are also superb.  I wish they would expand into a bigger place and in a different location.  This is a place to EAT not for ambience whatsoever."}
{"text":"I love this little place! It's a small cafeteria style restaurant but the food speaks for itself. The Pho is better than most. You can taste authenticity and not just water being boiled in a pot. I had the beef Pho, I could not finish the entire bowl. The portions are generous and reasonably priced.  The best part was homemade dessert macaroons filled with ice cream! I had the strawberry with taro.  The only con I have here is that the location is not very convenient since I live on the opposite side of town. Nonetheless, I cherish every moment here whenever I am here.   The service is great, everyone greets you with a smile and will answer any questions you might have."}
{"text":"Dirty, unsanitary place,, bad,,unfriendly service,, food is , I don't recommend it,, I know I will never go back"}
{"text":"This place is defiantly in the area of town that's ran down. However, although the place is in not such a good area it's the best Pho I have had by far. Good broth good taste and the staff was friendly. I took my 21 year old son with me and he also enjoyed the food. I will be back for a bowl of Pho."}
{"text":"First of all, do not be scared by the exterior of this establishment. I know that this placed probably used to be a Jack in the Box but once inside you will be greeted by a friendly face. This place has a very ma-and-pa feel to it. And you can taste the love and care that they put in their food. We tried the pho and a BBQ fresh roll. And it was the best i have had! The waiter gladly answered any question i had about the menu and even made great recommendations. As for dessert, we tried their macarons ice cream sandwiches. It was big servings... Just wish that i saved some room for them!  This place is definitely my favorite Vietnamese restaurant!"}
{"text":"Wow. I was shocked when I found this jewel!  Amazing flavor, huge portions and so affordable!!  There was a wait for a table of about 20 minutes when I went but it was worth it. My only wish is that it was in a larger space."}
{"text":"Their ice cream macaroons are obviously my favorite things off the menu hear. The pho with everything is good too. I've had better and not too far from here but this place is not bad. Good service and looks clean! Always busy when we go though so I wish they had more tables."}
{"text":"Great staff, tasty food and the best prices in town. $6.50 for a huge bowl of Pho. We also got a lunch special that came with a bowl  of broth. Staff recommended I dip chicken  and rice in broth and that made the flavors phenomenolly tasty."}
{"text":"The only thing I come here for is there macaroon ice cream sandwich, tastes like a slice of heaven. Probably has like 500 calories but well worth it. Call before you go because they run out sometimes during summer."}
{"text":"This place is 100% legit. The broth of their pho soup is phenomenal. Their rice dish combos are definitely great to go dishes too. Portion size for almost every entree is very generous. The only reason they get a 4 instead of a 5 is because sometimes some of the male servers show foul faces. And sometimes they really don't have good manners. But ultimately the food is too good to pass up."}
{"text":"My favorite pho spot in Arizona. Always full of flavor and always on point. I always grab a rau ma or iced coffee when I'm here too but it's probably cause they're the best when you're hungover. Definitely also recommend saving some room for an ice cream macaroon preferably the taro cookie and Pandan ice cream flavors."}
{"text":"Every pho place that I go to I compare to this place. This pho place is exactly what the gold standard is. Broth is delicious and the serving is generous. Eating basil leaves with lemon and salt is a great appetizer while I wait. Parking can be a real pain but they have a tiny lot. I believe that they are family owned and some of the servers are not to friendly and I feel like that's what is lacking in pho 43. Like they know they have good food and people will come back so why go above and beyond? I don't know . They always hook us up though. I got my order to go and was kind of surprised that I had to cook the beef for the beef pho for a second or 2 because they gave it to me raw. Maybe it's a personality thing. Maybe it's maybelline.   One more thing. The shrimp spring rolls had 3shrimp cut is half so I was kind of getting only 1.5 shrimp per roll. Kind of mean guys. But hey your peanut sauce is impeccable !!   Oh and I never come by in time for the macaroons !!! I was in town for a couple of days and couldn't stay till Sat or Sun. Broke my heart you guys didn't have any available."}
{"text":"Recently relocated from California & looking for some tasty pho close to work. The pho broth was on the sweeter side to my taste, but overall very flavorful!! Tried one of their macaroon ice cream sandwiches-taro w/pandan ice cream.  One word: DELICIOUS!! Place is a bit small, get there early for lunch to beat the crowd. Has a \"mom/pop\" vibe which I like. No frills atmosphere. Prices are very reasonable too."}
{"text":"I've never tried Thai food before this place. So, I have nothing to compare it to. I think that the restaurant is pretty cool. The staff is friendly. The cashier helped me find a dish that she thought that I would enjoy. They have these awesome slushies. The food was ok. Taste fine. Thai food isn't as filling as I would like. At least the dish that I chose. Which was good, being that I am counting macros. Everything was from fresh ingredients. Good place."}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing food. This place is a local favorite and gets very busy at lunch time. Pro Tip: get there early and order your macaroons the day before. They sell out fast!"}
{"text":"Amazing! First time going to this place and customer service was on point! Don't get me started with the pho!! The best pho in Az  you really taste the flavor and the broth!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite Phó restaurant. Every time I go it never disappoints. I've been going to this establishment for a couple of years. Every time I go I'm supposed to take a picture for this Yelp review. But I'm always so excited to eat that I forget to take a picture. This place is very busy at all times. That's a good thing though. If you want good food you have to wait a little. Very nice staff it's family operated and they're doing it right and very professional. I always get steak and brisket #10. But once in a while I'll go with the extra large combination #1 which is the Dac Biet Xe Lua. I also always take a coffee to go. Gets me going lol OMG! How can I forget the macaroons!? My girlfriend loves these things! I'm not a sweets guy but I'll take em. With ice cream! Like I said, great place, food never disappoints and great service. These guys are from far away from my home. But it feels like HOME to me. Thanks you guys keep up the nice work!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I was so surprised with how food everything was. The outside appearance of the establishment is misleading to the quality of the food. My chicken pho was delicious. It had a great amount of chicken and the flavored were great. I also has spring rolls with the most amazing peanut sauce. We saved room for a macaroons ice cream sandwich and we were definitely glad we did!"}
{"text":"This place was really full. Its a small restaurant, so it might be hard to find a seat. I was really intrigued by all the good reviews so I came. The place could do with some better decor and larger space. Felt a bit claustrophobic. Noodles come in a large portion with lots of meat. My friend found a little piece of plastic in her noodles but they were kind enough to offer to remake it and take her noodles off the bill. The waiters were really kind and friendly, good hospitality. Overall, it was an ok experience but I've had better."}
{"text":"Loooooove this place! Not because I know the owners but because the food is fab! I usually get the bun bo hue which is a spicy noodle soup or the pho w/ meatballs. Another good dish is bun Bo xao and spring rolls! Definitely love the food and the home-y atmosphere where you get treated like family :)"}
{"text":"Great place in the hood to grab some Pho, the owners are super cool and always keep the place moving. Def a place to stop into on a regular"}
{"text":"The spring rolls and Pho was delicious! And it wasn't even expensive!! Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Great pho! You can't go wrong on choice of meats, I have tried them all. Pork and Chicken dishes are marinated perfectly. Very generous portions of everything especially for the prices. Great lunch spot if you are anywhere close to 43th Ave. Parking can be tight. Don't let the outside of the building fool you. Great food lies within."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in the valley, always a friendly and pleasant staff and the food is as good as it gets! I always get the Tai Chin (Beef & Brisket pho), Bi Cuon Shredded Pork Rolls and a Vietnamese Coffee, easily one of my top five favorite meals all time! Glad they're so close to my work, too."}
{"text":"Great Food!!! Some of the best Pho I've had, and I'm from OC, near Llittle Saigon.. This place is as good as you will find in AZ. Quality food, good service and a friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by a friend years ago and must say they have the best pho and macaroons in town! You have to try their Lemongrass Chicken and also the Grilled Pork, Egg, and Rice! I can't say anything bad about this place! It's no wonder why they are still around! PS. Get the pineapple smoothie to drink!"}
{"text":"I decided to try Pho43; it was small and quaint, like it's been there for decades. The neighborhood was not the most appealing, but I've heard nothing but the best recommendations. It was packed and busy, and had enough sitting for 10 small parties.  Every time I get Pho, I make sure to get brisket and steak and an order of crispy egg rolls. The trip was definitely worth it. The broth was traditional, heavier with onions versus other places I've gone too. Ingredients were all fresh and food was definitely served hot. The egg rolls were very crispy and delicious; if I wasn't so full, I would've ordered more.   I didn't get the chance to try the Macaroons by Binh, but will definitely come back. Make sure to get there early as it get packed. Staff was very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"The best Pho in Phoenix , have tried several places but this is the BEST  Service is always quick very helpful wait staff , everything is so fresh and the spring rolls are on our point."}
{"text":"The best pho in town, and a big serving!"}
{"text":"Family owned and operated for 20+ years. I could go here every night and wouldn't get bored with it. Especially if I could have those macaroon ice cream sandwiches! Nom nom nom ^.^"}
{"text":"I may be slightly overdue for a review because I'm here almost every weekend lately. But Pho 43 is THE BEST Vietnamese food I've ever had in Arizona, hands down. And no, it's not just because they sell macarons (which are also the best in my opinion). Before they ever had macarons, my boyfriend and I came in because he found it driving by. We are super attracted to small, hole-in-the-wall places. Of course to set the tone, we had to order their pho. We have never had pho so fresh and flavorful with meat so succulent -- where do they get their ingredients?! Their rice vermicelli noodles with pork and egg roll is also my all time favorite. Ugh, just the best. And let me tell you, we have tried our share of Vietnamese food. You name it, we've probably tried it. And now this place is about the only place we ever go to to fulfill our Vietnamese food needs. Who cares if it's a tiny shack in the not-so-great part of Phoenix?! Not me. And their macarons and macaron ice cream sandwiches, I can talk about them all day. But it's really simple. They are one word: AMAZING. I wasn't into the whole trendy macaron addiction until I came here. When I try other macarons to see if theirs compares, they never do. Shoutout to David and MacaronsbyBinh! I am a huge fan. My boyfriend Kit loves talking to David and loves how passionate he is about the macarons! Thanks Pho 43 for being our weekly pleasure :)"}
{"text":"The phrase, \"Don't judge a book by its cover,\" can definitely be used for this establishment. On the outside, you would not consider this place unless you were referred or went on yelp. The inside would also be classified as par for decor. However, with the packed parking lot and tables full, you know something is up. The staff was attentive and prompt. When my food came out, it looked great and for the price, very fair! I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is one of those HOOD classics that has plenty of business with or without my rating. The pho was very tasty but it was a bit too greasy for my taste. I literally had oil on my lips after each bite because they use fatty pieces of beef in the broth ( I LOVE fatty meat, just a bit too much). The sliced Tai meat was in a big wad like no one took the time to separate. The other dishes were okay. We got a rice plate that my son liked. And the appetizers were okay. It isn't anything I would travel from Chandler for. If you are scared of dirty places like Cali status, you probably shouldn't come here. I think there were about 10 people working in here, none of which were properly uniformed. I just wonder if they appear this disheveled and random, how my food is really being handled."}
{"text":"Great little family owned place with food that exceeded all my expectations. It's always a packed place for lunch so get there early. This place will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Came here just for the ice cream macaroons and let me tell you, it was totally worth it.  The cookies were perfect and the ice cream so good.  The guy who makes it was super friendly and made sure we enjoyed it.  I don't think I'm saying anything new but want to give props when it's deserved."}
{"text":"Went there the other day.  It was our first time and the Pho was bomb! !! Going to go back again."}
{"text":"Number 42 was very well made with seasoning. Recommend to people who like dry vermicelli bowls."}
{"text":"So dont judge a book by its cover. This place is small and nothing fancy but the Pho packs big flavor. The staff is friendly and the prices are affordable. Give it a shot as it is now on my list of great lunch stops. Closed on Tuesdays? Oh well I guess no Pho on Tue for me."}
{"text":"I'm normally hesitant to write reviews after only visiting a place once, but this place is a far drive for me so I'm not sure when I'll be back.  Overall, I had a really good experience. The pho broth is really really tasty- normally I add hoisin sauce and Sriracha to my pho broth but found myself not wanting to change the depth of flavor that was in this bowl. I also had the fried egg rolls. Delicious :) full of meat!  The best part was the macarons! I tried the massive macaron ice cream sandwich in the pandan flavor- a flavor that I normally don't stumble upon in normal French pasty shops selling macarons. It was delicious.  You can tell its a friendly family run business and they take pride in their product. Everyone was very friendly and they tried really hard to get us seated quickly despite the wait. I would definitely return if it wasn't so far away!"}
{"text":"The pho here is good. If it were closer I would definitely come here more often.  Do not be intimidated by the location. These types of places don't disappoint"}
{"text":"Love this place I went in for lunch and it was packed as it should be the food was amazing. I will be going back."}
{"text":"I have very high standards for pho and pho43 except for broth being a bit sweet for my taste met my expectations. The meats in pho are a little crude (chewy, fatty, slimy parts that I prefer). Cost efficacy is unbeatable m. The pork and shrimp combination in their spring rolls was quite impressive as well. I was recommended macaroon ice cream so that's what I will try next time."}
{"text":"The Spring Rolls are a definite must have!  As for the noodle salad it was flavor-able but mainly noodles and greens.  I would love to go back for the soup which is what they specialize in.  I wasn't impressed with the pork, it was too dry for my taste.  If your in this neighborhood and looking for a new spot.....give'em a chance.  REMEMBER to bring your cash.....cash only!"}
{"text":"Great pho, friendly people. I was really hungry, looking for good cheap eats, Yelp recommended these folks. Had a large pho tai with extra noodles and it was as good as anywhere I've eaten. Rich tasty broth, lots of veggies (e.g. onion). Also had their home made soy bean drink - very nice.  Talked to one of the brothers who runs it. In business at the same location since 1991, started by their parents. Nice people serving outstanding and incredibly inexpensive food."}
{"text":"I don't know what I was thinking driving all the way to Pho Thanh after reading a few great reviews on Yelp. 43rd Express definitely has far superior Pho. Broth was flavorful and not oily like Thanh. $5 for a bowl of Pho? What a steal! The egg rolls were a bit too oily for my taste but the spring rolls were pretty good. Service was not up to par though. When I walked in I was warmly greeted and server was attentive upon taking my order, but I was disappointed once I got my meal. I'm not sure if this is a common thing in Vietnamese restaurants because everyone I've been to I've experience similar service, but once my meal was brought to my table the service pretty much went out the door. It's difficult to even get their attention. They just retrieve to behind the cash register or are more preoccupied with welcoming new customers. Not the nicest location either and they only take cash, but I don't really mind given that it's some of the best Pho I've had."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch w/ the family. We ordered cha gio which was alright. It tasted kinda bland so I dipped it in the fish sauce that was accompanied with it. Yeah bad mistake since the sauce taste like it came straight from the fish sauce bottle. The hubby ordered the broken rice with bbq pork, steamed eggs, and shredded pork. He didn't like it at all but ate it anyways since he was hungry. He doesn't usually order stuff like that so that's the only reason why he didn't like it. I ordered the pho tai bo bien. The broth smelled aromatic the way that pho should smell like with all the spices and herbs mixed together but it was maybe a little bit too much since that was all I tasted. I couldn't taste the beef flavor at all. Overall it smelled wonderful but it could have had a better balance in flavors. The bean sprouts, limes, and basils that came with it wasn't too fresh. The lime was brown around the edges where it was cut and the basil was kinda wilted. I gave this place three stars because the service was great and you get a free drink for checking in with yelp. Would I come back? Not likely."}
{"text":"The food and macaroons are always super delicious but another reason why this place is super GREAT is because they have the BEST customer service! Thank you Pho 43!"}
{"text":"Was iffy about this place due to the location & the look of it BUT we gave it a try anyway... & it was great packed but we were sat right away .. Our order was also taken within minutes. It was great. Awesome and the ice cream sandwhiches... Phenomenal!!! *tip your waitresses/waiters* !!!! (:"}
{"text":"I am very picky when it comes to Pho. It has to have a clear and fragrant broth, Pho's meat has to be tender and no strong smell. I just recently moved from California so it is very hard to find a good Pho here in Arizona. Well 43rd Express has me settle down with their Pho.. Their Pho broth has a fragrant that reminds me the one from Vietnam..that shows how good their Pho is. Hands down.. I also love how they have a good service. Last time I wanted to try their Bun Bo Hue and their Sam Bo Luong, but they ran out. They apologized and let me switch my order to Bun Thit Nuong and Thai Tea. I would love the Bun Thit Nuong more if the noodles are little bit more dry instead it is still wet like it had just been cooked and drain and didnt have time to dry.  I also ordered the Vietnamese Coffee..OMG sooo good...it is just right for me, not too bitter or overwhelminy sweet..Perfecto.. I came back today to try their Bun Bo Hue again and it was good. I love how tender the meat is, it just falls off from the chopsticks and melt in your mouth... And you know the real reason to come back again is for their awesome macarons. The owner showed me every flavors of macarons and he let me pick out from the box..How Awesome is that??? Million thumbs up ^^ I will come back again definitely."}
{"text":"I've basically been here every weekend these last couple months (sometimes twice a week) that the owners already know my order and dont even give me the menu. This place is a small, unassuming mom and pop restaurant in an unassuming side of town with amazing food. If you like really good and cheap Vietnamese food, stop reading and go now. It's nice that the prices dont hurt your wallet cause you have some money to spend for the macaron ice cream sandwiches or regular macarons (weekends only).   PS. For all my macaron aficionados out there - these macarons are not your fake hollow macarons that a bunch of stores sell nowadays. These are legit macarons that have good feet and a FULL interior......actually no...dont believe anything I say....I dont want them to be out of stock when I get there..."}
{"text":"Are you the type of person who likes to explore new places? A true adventurer by definition? Have I got a hot one for you; 43rd Express, aka; 'Pho 43rd'.  Owned by the same Vietnamese family for over twenty years, Pho 43rd, despite its dive-like ambiance both inside and out, is truly a charm.  The pho is above average and served with all the accoutrements; bean sprouts, Vietnamese basil, and jalapenos.  Try the beef, tripe and tendon pho, asking them to conspicuously leave out the tendon and tripe. (I never said I was an adventurer, I only asked if you were) It's delicious.  Their sauces are a delight, featuring a traditional siracha, their own chili paste, and a delicious homemade hoisin sauce.  Spring rolls were light and wonderfully tasty. A strong recommend.  The service is fast and very friendly. Upon leaving, the owner introduced himself and gave us a brief history of the restaurant:  -How he and his brother worked in the kitchen since they were small children. -How the family has owned the restaurant for over twenty years, surviving the great recession.  -How mom is now retired, passing on the family business to her sons.   His story was impressive. One that makes anyone not familiar with the restaurant industry know just how difficult it is to succeed in this type of business, with all the hard work and sacrifice. Pho 43rd ceased to be a dive at that point, embodying the true spirit of capitalism and the American dream.  I left, feeling both satiated, and proud of David (owner) and his family for what they've accomplished.  If you're disinclined to visit a place like this based on its location and outward appearance, you'll be missing out.   IMPORTANT NOTE: THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH."}
{"text":"Pho is very good, but the noodles are too much and meats are just a little. This is a small place but I feel comfortable, the staffs are nice. I'll keep trying more dishes in here."}
{"text":"Okay everything we got was so tasteful. I sampled the two other dishes that my friends ordered and they were both delish... I tried for the 1st time Bunn  Bo Hue and it was bomb!"}
{"text":"This place has the best vermicelli bowl around, I only eat this when I come here because it's that good :D"}
{"text":"Pho 43 is located in a shopping centre in West Phoenix.  The setup is not fancy, it is not a sit-down diner type restaurant. You place your order by number off the menu which consists of multiple varieties including appetizers, noodles, pho, vermicelli, soup, and rice.  On this visit I had the pork fried rice and an order of egg rolls. To be honest the  food was just okay nothing really stood out.  Maybe next time I will try the Pho and  the Macaroons.  If you are looking for fast service, reasonable pricing, and lots of parking, this might be the place for you."}
{"text":"Best service I've ever had in my life. I will always support this business and come here because the food is amazing but the service is beyond phenomenal. Whenever we have visitors we always bring them here. We always recommend this place. I could go on forever. I'm in love with this place xoxoxoxo"}
{"text":"Look this is not the best place in town for Pho - but at some point beggars can't be choosers.  Were this on Camelback and 15th Ave I might give this place a lower rating - but if you work in the industrial part of Buckeye (as I often do) and you want something other than chain fast food, mexican, this is a pretty decent option.   Decent Pho, decent egg rolls, decent smiling service."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review. I agree with most of what the Yelpers have to review. My family and I live very far away, far north phoenix yet we would make the trek down south to Pho 43. We've been coming here for over 10 years.Saw it when the mom ran the place and before the remodel. We drove all that way because the food was really good and authentic and flavorful and the amount you got for your buck was a lot of bang. My mom is an extremely picker eater and has only liked one dish on their menu, I don't remember now. It's seafood based and has fillets of fish in the soup. Also takes a lil longer to make. For the past 10+ years, they have had this dish available. The last several times we have gone they tell us they are out. We tried to give them the benefit of the doubt thinking ok, a weekend has just passed, or it's still early in the day. But when you go at such random times and days and they continue to be out, we suspect, it's a dish they are no longer making. Which is fine, then take it off the menu or tell your customers. Because we go in expecting to order something and for it to not be available is quite disappointing time after time. Each time my mom has had to order something else to which she does not care much for. The shrimp soup and the presentation is awful. All there is, are 5 little shrimps floating around the bowl. That's a lot of money for a bowl of noodles. My dad who is not a picky eater at all and does not complain much about food because he never had much as a child. Even his go to staple, number 1, he said had diminished in quality in regards to taste. The prices were raised which is understandable with the way the economy is, but then don't skimp on the portion and make it obviously so. The quality of the food has seemed to go down a bit over the years as the younger generation took over the restaurant. There seems to be less attentiveness meaning, we've gone in and there are plates all over the tables and no one has bussed them. We've been eating our meal and I can see the staff sitting around and looking on their phones and there are dishes and plates all over the tables. I think it's exciting to have new items like the macaroon ice cream sandwiches and a hipster-esque feeling to the place, but as a long time customer of Pho 43, it's a little disappointing to see some of the other changes.  We have ceased driving all that way to Pho 43. No sense in doing that when we know we will be disappointed in their lack of availability for some of the dishes."}
{"text":"Probably the best Pho I have had in the city. The broth had lots of flavor the beef was very tender and all the vegetables where fresh. The service was excellent also."}
{"text":"Quite easily the best Pho I've (personally) tasted outside of the Bay Area. The service is super lowkey and fast. The quality of everything is great. My go-tos are the chicken Pho and the BBQ pork spring rolls. Their peanut sauce is great!  Don't be fooled by the outside. It's the real deal."}
{"text":"Wahhhhhhhhh!!!! I found the da vang near Laveen! OKAY before you bash my review, that was a compliment!!!  Every pho places I have been to, are lower standards than DA VANG superior food flavor. Let me say that this place surpasses that and it's has that da vang flavor too in some of their food:)  This just became my number 1 pho place!!!"}
{"text":"they only accept cash!! I took a peek at the menu, then had to run out ot my car to collect the quarters from the ash tray LOL (I wanted to make sure I could leave a 20% tip!)  We came for lunch about 2 weeks ago. Ben had the tendon and flank steak pho and I had the brisket and flank steak. Both really good and really cheap at about $5 each. They did serve lemon instead of lime and only gave us one wedge (I love extra lime in my pho!) I won;t complain too much though because I also did not ask for extra... We also ordered the spring rolls which were good.  The last few Vietnamese places I've been to have all been good and basically the same (you can read my other reviews), but then again-I always order the same thing at each place and don' t really stray from my norm :)"}
{"text":"One of my new favorites! They were really busy when we got there but still seated us right away but now I know why they are so busy! I actually recently saw a comedy show by Ali Wong and in her skit she does mention that it's not legit unless it has a number  so that's actually one reason I decided to try the place. I've always gone to a different location because it was near my job but I was visiting around the area so I decided to give it a try and I will definitely be back with friends."}
{"text":"I was craving Pho for lunch and found a hidden gem! The food is amazing! The restaurant is small and very popular. I found this place using yelp and decided to give it a try. I am glad I did. I highly recommend. Customer service is good and they are friendly."}
{"text":"I pretty much come here at least once a week or whenever I am craving PHO. I have to say I have tried many PHO out here in Arizona and this place is by far the best PHO I ever tried. Great Broth ITs all about the BROTH!   The broth is a deal breaker for me when if comes to pho if it doesn't taste right then everything else is pretty much pointless because your meat and noodles are soaked in the broth so wouldn't it ruin the taste on everything else?  I only wish they added ox-tail to there PHO.  Overall! Price is great $ very affordable and best PHO"}
{"text":"Good little hole in the wall Vietnamese place...  If you didn't know about it you would surely drive by and never even notice it was there.   The family that owns it has always been friendly to is.  The Pho and other food has always been good...  They even have homemade ice cream macaroons which are often the reason to go way over to the west side 45 minutes from where we usually are...."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with 43rd Express.  Its a ghetto hole in the wall place, I would never have stepped foot in here if it wasn't for Yelp reviews, so kudos to you, because I would have missed out, as it was delicious and flavorful.  I had the soda lemonade, which was very refreshing, tangy and sweet.  I tried their Vermicelli salad, and one of the staff told me to pour the fish sauce all over it, and I'm glad that I did, it was fantastic.  One of those meals that takes you off guard, and leaves you satisfied, because it tastes great and seems sort-of healthy!  I finished it off with the Taro Macaroon Ice cream sandwich, a very interesting purple colored cookie, and very unique sweet flavor, Im a convert."}
{"text":"We came here on a whim and left beyond satisfied. The staff is super friendly and the food is on point. The macaroons are a MUST! My crystal ball confirms that we will be coming again soon."}
{"text":"Delicious and affordable! Definitely a hole in the wall, in not the nicest part of town, but that's what probably keeps the prices down! Got the steak and meatball pho, and pork fried rice. Great sized portions. I liked how the Pho broth wasn't too salty for me. It was just right. Thought the rice was tasty, not what I would order next time, but tasty. The macaron ice cream sandwich was everything I ever dreamed about! Lived up to the hype and will totally bring me back, along with my friends."}
{"text":"This place is EPIC.  So good.  And not just one thing they do is good....it's ALL good.  Their Vietnamese espresso w/ condensed milk?  silky smooth.  Their lemonaide?  Fresh-squeezed.  Their pho?  I want to buy the broth by the pint.  And their macaron ice cream sandwiches?  just. so. good.  I ordered the taro macaron with taro ice cream coated in cinnamon toast crunch.  It was amazing, and was Barney-the-dinosaur purple.  This is a mom and pop-style hole in the wall.  You'll pull up on this place and think \"really?  This place has epic food?\"  The neighborhood and exterior are not particularly inviting.  Go on in though, and you'll find a busy simple little restaurant with friendly staff serving what is certainly the best pho on the west side, if not all of Phoenix."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend, who is friends with the owners and sons of the restaurant (but don't worry, this won't make my review biased).  Definitely a family-owned and operated hole-in-the-wall ... THAT DOESN'T SUCK! This place is GREAT! Comes with delicious macaroons made in-house (not free of course), quality pho to cure those hangovers, and chill waiters and waitresses.  The space is small, and has a limited number of seating, so be aware of the times you come (obviously, crowded at lunch and dinner), and plan accordingly. Other than that, very great place to come and get your pho/macaroon fix. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Nothing impressive about this place besides the big size spring rolls. The pho soup was average."}
{"text":"This is exactly what Guy Fieri of Triple D is looking for , it's off he beaten path looks a little rundown and had killer Pho! I had the tofu and my son had the steak, both were amazing and the  service was fast and friendly"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and I think we found our new spot! We were seated immediately and our waiter, David, gave us the best service I've experienced in a long time. I had the shrimp fried rice and their ice cream macaroon was out of this world! Really happy with how everything was today :) definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Love the \"Bun Nuoc Leo\" not many Pho places have it.   If you like Seafood soups this is by far the best!!!!!"}
{"text":"The best Pho, period. Although I like to spice mine up with sriracha, add a dab of hoisin and a squeeze of lime I always make sure I take a sip of the broth on its own when it is brought out and I recommend that everyone to do the same at any pho institution. I tell everyone I meet to come here when asked about Pho or Vietnamese food. No room for dessert? No problem, order the Macaroon ice cream sandwich and you'll finish it anyway."}
{"text":"I honestly don't even know where to begin but since we've moved here from Cleveland a year & a half ago we have tried almost every place. I learned not to trust Yelp! all the time because everyone has different taste pallettes. Anyways, we've been to a lot of places but 1 that didn't seem to let us down is Pho Thanh on 17th & Camelback. Not bad. Great prices. Service is mediocre & the food is decent. Not the best we've had but better than all the other places we've been. Well the same friend that recommended that restaurant to us had found 43rd Express & told us about it. We trust his judgment because well, he hasn't let us down yet. He was right. It was very tasteful. I didn't have to add or \"remake\" my soup at the table like I usually do. I ate it as is. Sidenote; growing up, my mother was and still is the number 1 cook. And no, I don't say that because she is my mother but so does the rest of the world that has tried her food. So she made it very difficult for everyone else because nothing will ever be better than her cooking. Anyhow, this place however didn't fall far behind her. We ordered the #1. Since we were sharing we decided to go with the Super Duper size. Good & bad idea. Bad because it was way too much food and we couldn't even get halfway through. Good because we have leftover but usually it wouldn't be as good. We also ordered Banh Xeo (vietnamese crepes). For the price, I couldn't believe we were getting 2, for the whole order. But even more surprising,  it came out to taste even better than it looked and it looked pretty amazing. The nuoc mam (vietnamese special sauce) was so very good as well & i have never in my life found any other restaurant that I was actually satisfied with their sauce. I mean, that sauce is everything. To me anyways. If it's not good, it's just not satisfying. We also had goi cuon (Vietnamese spring rolls ) and those were pretty good as well. Overall, if I could give it more stars I would. Before you leave don't forget to try the macarons. Oh they were delicious. We had it Togo but it still didn't make it to the car. To end my long book story here, I just want to add that the service wasn't all that great because the females seem to have a problem. All but Cindy. Now she is all the more reason why I would even love to come back because she was amazing. She is very friendly, personable and beyond helpful. We enjoyed conversing with her. She definitely held it down and she gets her own 5 stars."}
{"text":"It may be located in a rough area, but the food quality is as good as anything you'll find in Old Town Scottsdale. The pho is excellent and fairly priced, as is the Thai tea. We ordered Vietnamese sausage links (I forget the actual name) that were delicious, but a little sparse for their cost. The staff, especifically the manager, were accomodating and cool about our children, who were acting up. I do plan on returning to try a few more items."}
{"text":"Always enjoy stopping here on my way out of phoenix. Great place to get some food. House fried rice is my favorite."}
{"text":"As a Southern California native, I require only best Vietnamese food and Phoenix leaves much to be desired. You can imagine my trepidation when I stumbled upon this gem, only after a mishap of my favorite taco shop being closed for the day (Ta'Carbon). The ambiance is telling of the genuine and palpable nature of the place; the small shop is fairly run down, Vietnamese people lounge outside, and the interior smells of authentic home cooking. The expectations drawn from such a sight are translated right to your bowl/plate. At last, my ardent standards for Pho have been satisfied. I will certainly be returning in the near future."}
{"text":"The pho was the best ever. I've tried a lot of pho - Vietnamese restaurants in the valley and this one is by far my fav. Not just because the food is authentic and serving size is generous for the price, also they are a friendly family owned business that the servers are so nice and work as a team to get you whatever you need, but they have the best ice cream macaroon sandwiches!  If you are in the mood for pho or their ice cream sandwiches I recommend Pho 43. They get pretty crowded but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This place is legitimately the best place for pho! I go at least 4 times a month to eat here (I'm addicted) and everything I've ordered besides the pho is exceptionally good too! You're not going to be disappointed at 43rd express. The service is also exceptional (family owned) and they have delicious macaroon and macaroon ice cream sandwiches. So I'm pretty much in love with this place, If I could I would marry 43rd express :p"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Great service & great food! Their macaron sandwich was the best! I will definitely come back & refer others!"}
{"text":"Pho is flavorful and portions are generous. My son and I could easily share one bowl. However, my group and I were disappointed by their lackluster service. No smile. No greeting. Not one thank you. No personality it felt like.  Even after I went out of my way to say how delicious their pho was. Also, did not see one single macaron or their pretty pastel chalkboard menu as I've seen in photos. Maybe I was oblivious??... upon entering they proudly display the \"People on Yelp Love Us\" sticker. Very casual atmosphere. Nothing fancy. I was looking forward to this Yelp find.  We seated ourselves when no one led us to a table. There were about five other tables of diners. And when we did receive menus, it took longer than a few moments for the server to return for our order, despite that we saw four people standing behind the register on their phones or chatting. Once ordering we waited at least ten-fifteen minutes for our pho and egg rolls. Longest I've ever waited for pho. It just seemed unusually long for pho. I noticed their condiment tray on each table is wiped down cleanly, and neat! Nice to see. However, ours needed spoons to be replenished. Other than that, all their sriracha and hoisin bottles did not have a single drop of disarray to them.  Egg rolls were delicious. It's a unique filling, seems like all the ingredients are ground up, but whatever the combination of meats and spices, it was tasty. Platter of greens and bean sprouts were plentiful. Pho, again, was delicious. We ordered extra noodles to share our bowls with the kids and still found we had too much food. I do love their pho here. Server did return once to ask how our meal was, again, no smile or personality. No water refill. Due to the lackluster customer service though, we hastily just ate and left. I completely forgot to ask for their macaron. Looking back on my photos and dining, I remember the fridge looking very sparse so maybe they were out of stock on macarons at that time. I'll revisit and try this place again another time. Walked myself up to the counter to pay the bill. Four diners, two pho's, two sides of noodles and an order of egg rolls, our meal came to $30 with tip."}
{"text":"First time.  Love everything from the Pho with steak to the yummy spring rolls.  Not fancy but better than some fancy places I've been. Fresh hot homemade food.  Service top notch too.  Love it and will be back ;)))  Had to come back and edit my review. People we had the desert ..,the Macarons. I shoulda taken a picture but it hit the table and we ate it. Friggen awesome!!"}
{"text":"Impressed! The banh xeo was very crunchy and did not skimp on the meat or shrimp. The portion size was good too. The grilled pork that I ordered had excellent flavor. The macaroon ice cream is good, but little on the sweet side. I wish they had more of their flavors but some are usually crossed out."}
{"text":"Don't let the appearance of this restaurant fool you! It's a family owned business with amazing authentic food at a great price!! By far, the best pho John and I have ever tried yet! Best soup, very flavorful! Noodles were perfect! John just wished there was a little more meat that came with the pho, but it was plenty for me. We will definitely come back when we visit Phoenix again! Thank you for the perfect last meal before we head home. (^.^)"}
{"text":"Bottom line up front:  \"Diamond in the rough\"  Through the years I've been accustomed to taste with my eyes before I approve with my palette.  Thus, I never really wanted to try Pho 43rd Express.  There is nothing special about its name, its surrounding, or the building itself.  If you make your way to the restaurant, the first thing you may notice is a crooked sign in the parking lot - which I'm sure an idiot with a large truck backed in to - and it makes you wonder:  what is so damn special about this place?  I finally have an answer so I'll attempt to articulate my experience and ingredients of \"special\".    Firstly, the food is . . . uniquely delicious.  Pho is pho is pho:  noodles, broth, meat, sauce, etc.  But 43rd's pho is different.  The broth is richer in flavor and exposes a hint of sweetness which makes the soup so satisfying, with or without additives (lime, cilantro, brown/red sauce, others).  And with the addition of lime, cilantro, those green leaves that I've never seen in other cuisines, sprouts, jalapenos (some are extremely spicy, but worth it every time), and sauce, I am ready to say goodbye to the world for 15 minutes and eat away my hunger, hangover, and sorrows.  And this is just one of their many offerings.  On other occasions, my stomach frequents \"Vietnamese pancakes\" when I want something different than the usual; those noodles topped with egg-rolls, veggies, and fish sauce when I want something filling but light; and various rice plates when I'm uncertain of what I want.  I am certainly ignorant for not remembering the names of each dish, but that's tolerated at 43rd Express and leads to my next point - the service.    Being family owned and operated, the staff work together as a family should.  They are close-knit and humorously bicker among each other, but remain focused, cohesive and entertaining, as an added bonus.  I laugh and sometimes chime in with a few words of my own which makes the enjoyment a two-way street and increases my odds for the occasional free dessert.  Also, it allows them to remember me and my food preferences, thus allowing me to remain ignorant with dish names.   The last thing I want to point out are the dessert offerings.  Available sweets include macarons, cream puffs, and ice cream.  I have concluded that there is some type of sorcery involved in creating these soft little delicacies.  In my opinion, the macarons are excellent (just-enough crunchy outer texture with a soft and gratifyingly chewy center) but the cream puffs are just better.  The filling reveals creamy and buttery sweetness without overwhelming the outer layer's taste and maintains the right amount of firmness that allows a few bites without having to tear the poor thing with your fingers and teeth.  However, I think it's best if eaten whole.  Perhaps two at a time.    And with these three ingredients mixed together, refined over time, results Pho 43rd Express.  A diamond in its natural form, a true bang for your buck, an absolutely special restaurant that offers delicious food, second-to-none desserts, and good vibes.    Thanks for reading!"}
{"text":"The Pho is full of flavor and the broth is on the sweeter side. I also had the combo fried rice. As a main corse it was delicious and filling. But the kicker here for me was the surprising red velvet macaroon strawberry ice cream sandwich. HOLLY CRAP was that thing amazing.  \"David with a beard\" thank you for telling me about this place during our Uber ride together. It was a great place to have lunch with my family."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim, at my cousin's recommendation. The pho is actually pretty good, like the vietnamese version of \"soul food.\" Really salty but really filling. The atmosphere could use a touch, and they could use a soda fountain. Way cheap, and staff are very personable."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place because all my friends from north Phoenix have recommended this place and when I finally went, it was rather disappointing. The portion sizes are pretty darn big. Their medium sized bowls are extra large at other places. But i had a problem with their broth. It's got too much artificial spices, me and my company each had to drink 2 bottles of water afterwards and couldn't help but fall asleep due to MSG. I had high hopes for macaron ice cream but that too, nothing is house made. This is a busy place so I didn't expect a hotel quality service but we never got a refill on water. Btw they dont bring you a check you need to walk up to the register and pay for your food."}
{"text":"My sister and I wanted to find a new place to have pho rather than our usual places we go to, so we decided to take a chance on 43rd Express. I'm so glad we did. It looked pretty rundown on the outside of the restaurant but the food was delicious and very reasonably priced. We tried the vermicelli bowl with BBQ pork & egg rolls. It was so good! We also tried some beef pho & spring rolls which were also very tasty. Overall it was a pleasant experience and I can't wait to go back. I saw that they sell macaron ice cream sandwiches so I definitely want to go back to try one! They look amazing."}
{"text":"The Pho broth is sensational, best in Phoenix, AND reasonably priced.  Very friendly and fast service as well.  Only downside is cramped seating area and during peak time there is no formal system for determining who waited the longest for seating (i.e. a hostess stand, list etc).  So you have to fend for your self to get a table."}
{"text":"Omg! The macaroon with ice cream are the best. It's a separate business so you have to pay cash. Watch out though as the can pretty addictive. These are a must try. The food here is great and the prices are really good."}
{"text":"Despite the looks of this place and the neighborhood, the food and service is outstanding. Try the Thai Tea. I ordered the vermicelli noodles that came with the egg roll on it and the banh xeo as well. Everything was delicious but the best part were the macarons. Give it a try one day it is very  tasty."}
{"text":"I love the Pho.  But the macaron ice cream sandwich is the best.  Taro flavor is the best!"}
{"text":"I been here twice and everytime I went I order the Pho Dac Biet Xe Lu. I think its the number 1 on the menu if my memory recalls correctly.  Anyways the broth for the soup is amazing! It has so much flavor that you really don't even need to add any hoisin sauce! If I had to rate 1-10 I'd give the soup a 10!  Now the noodles! O.m.g. The noodles they use are freaking heavy! I mean it is dense!! Like a big black rope. Duh what did you think I was gonna say? But no seriously the noodles are long and heavy it will fill you up pretty fast.   Reason I gave a 4 star and not a 5 star review is because.....welll..... I don't like long thick noodles lol. Everything else is great though! You have to try 2 things when you go here: -Pho -Macaroons  Now go and fill your stomach!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pho 43 is so delicious!! I really like the Spring Rolls with the peanut sauce and chili paste dip. It's refreshing! Today I also got the #47 which is vermicelli with fried beef. Very tasty! The flavors are definitely present!! It's your hole in the wall place, quaint but quality is 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I tried a couple of the rice dishes and the food is spectacular. The restaurant itself has a nice atmosphere. It feels like you're interacting with family, as the employees are friendly. No display negative attitudes which makes the stay while eating comfortable. The dishes are fairly priced to quality food. I mind the dust around the fans;;;"}
{"text":"I love the pho! Best in west phoenix. I also like how clean it is. I always get beef pho and egg rolls. Yummy!"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite Vietnamese spot in the valley. We took my brothers to try it out, based on its positive Yelp ratings. At first, it is nothing to look at. This family-run restaurant is located in an unassuming building with a small parking lot and the interior is crowded with small tables. However, the service is top-notch and the food is to die for. Our server was so friendly and considerate-- we would almost go again just for him! He was patient and helpful with his recommendations and just an all-around nice, friendly guy. We had egg rolls and spring rolls to start (both excellent), mango smoothies (yummy, but not totally necessary), and pho. Oh man, the pho was so good. The broth was tasty and the noodles were cooked just right. We didn't get to try the macaroons, as they are made by the server's sister and are only available on certain days/times, but I would like to go back to try them. We stuffed ourselves silly while there and walked away painfully full, but satisfied. Can't wait to go back!  Pros: -Delicious food. -Great service. -Good prices. -Family business.  Cons: -Location. It is quite a drive for us. -Limited parking."}
{"text":"At 7 pm tonight, Pho 43 turned us away.  They said they were closed, that they had already  \"Thrown the food away. \"  We got in our car and watched a family of 4 or 5 let in to the restaurant, so they fed them.  We went to another Viet Namese restaurant and it was delicious and cost less!  We will be going back to the 2nd restaurant!"}
{"text":"I loved it!!!!!# it's life the flavor on the Pho, I can eat pho allllllllll year here. #14"}
{"text":"I had the BBQ chicken which was ok, and note that it had a strange orange color to it.  Portions good, but the highlight was the taro/pandan ice cream macaron. Something new and delicious on a hot day!  On the fence about returning to try the pho. Servers not very friendly to me, but to others."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about Pho 43! The steak pho is to die for and I look forward to going on the weekends so I can have the macaroons and macaroon ice cream sandwiches. It is a family owned restaurant and you can tell by how warm and welcoming the staff is with one another and with their customers. I always get the best service and I have never had any complaints :)"}
{"text":"Kielbasa was very good and the bread bun tasted home made.  Enjoyable place and good atmosphere. Service was not good."}
{"text":"You'll always find the best food in the most unexpected places. Macaroons, pho, and great customer service? That's damn near impossible. But they did it. Sat down, got helped by a really awesome guy named David! He was welcoming and nice when he asked us for what we wanted and was kind enough to help us get to know how their menus work for macaroons and pho. NOT ONLY THAT, but the food was delivered no more than 4 minutes after ordering and holy sh*t was it good. Big kudos goes to these guys for everything they do."}
{"text":"Definetly a place to come if u like pho, friendly service nd amazing maccaroon ice cream sammy.. The spring rolls were over the top delishuss.. Cant wait to come back fr more... Dnt let the building fool you.. 5 star in my opinion"}
{"text":"I came here to try the cute little ice cream deserts and the famous macaroons, but the sister who makes them is on maternity leave. Good for her! This is a family owned restaurant and they are all honestly the sweetest people. And uh yeah...the food is amazing. I can't wait to come back. I'm always SO excited when I discover another restaurant that serves bò cuôn lá nho: grilled grape-leaf spiced beef rolls. This dish holds a very special place in my heart, as I've been eating it ever since I was a little girl. It's somewhat hard to find; I only know of 5 places in the AZ valley that serve it.  The Thai tea here is strong, and I love it! I could go into a food coma here, my eyes are too big for my stomach and I want to try EVERYTHING!!!"}
{"text":"They've upped their macaron game and they have alot of different flavors as well as interesting  toppings for their ice cream macarons. They occasionally make cute themed ones as well!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing... the food is so good.. the people especially the owner is so nice... omg don't 4get to try there macaroons it's to die for... even the ice cream macaroons are great as well... this place is one of the best place I've tasted.. and the plus side of all.. the price for there food is cheap compared to other vietnamis place I've tasted..."}
{"text":"AmIng Pho the best I had it's very family oriented everyone is always smiling and they are very nice people I love going there in the morning during the weekends it's always busy but it's totally worth the waiting ."}
{"text":"Although in a super sketch area, this place had delicious pho !!! Perfect combination of flavors and the spring rolls were amazing as well."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE . The ice cream sandwich son the weekends are amazing. The customer service is great."}
{"text":"Love this place came all the way from Tucson on vacation worth trying it"}
{"text":"Already forgot what I ordered but I can tell you it was delicious. I think I ordered the number 45. Will definitely return........Everyone was very friendly and greeted us as soon as we walked in."}
{"text":"Great food at a really good price. They also sold macaroons and they are amazingly delicious. Place is really small but totally worth coming!"}
{"text":"I ate lunch at this restaurant for the first time. I had heard great things form different co-workers and friends.  I pulled into the small, full parking lot. I lucked out and got one spot someone had just pulled out of.  The restaurant was full, we waited about ten minutes for a table.  I ordered the Pho Tat. I could see why this little hole in the wall was full. The Pho was fresh tasting and had great flavor.  The vegetarian spring rolls with peanut sauce was delicious!  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Best Vietnamese restaurant hands down!  Friendly staff, feels like you're  dining at home with friends.  Food/flavors are definitely on point!"}
{"text":"After reading all the positive reviews and having a yen for phò, we took a ride.   While there is no atmosphere, the food makes up for it.  Service was quick and the regular bowl of noodles is huge.  I had leftovers.  We both ordered #39 which consists of the fake crab, shrimp, and pork.  The dish comes with the standard dish of bean sprouts, lettuce, jalapeños and lime.  The soup is sprinkles with lots of roasted garlic which made it really tasty.  I don't eat pork and hubby was more than happy to eat it for me.  I noticed that most of their other dishes have pork.  That will not stop me from returning though.  The broth was exceptional as was the ingredients.  The price is more than fair."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite South Phoenix pho place. The area is a little sketchy, and the place is really small, but it's worth it.  The broth is very flavorful, and they are not stingy on the meat.  Have been here a handful of times and never disappointed. Just make sure you aren't in a hurry, the tables fill up fast because it's so small and you might have to wait"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now and it's always popping!! That's a good thing! And another is plenty of Asians eat here as well, which tells me the food is good and authentic. Please if you like \"Chinese food\" you will love this place! No doubt, it's a small humble place but the food is loud with flavor and worth more then just one visit. Pho was new for me, but after visiting twice with my mother I must say I prefer the fish broth based pho."}
{"text":"First time in.. looking for Pho joints on the way back to the west side instead of sitting in traffic. I'm a bit of a Pho snob and this place was absolutely amazing. I will be back. Got a #10 Steak and Brisket Pho and a Lemonade. I ate it all and now I can't move. My wife is getting a to go container for hers. Didn't even add much of anything to it."}
{"text":"Seriously, the outside looked like we were about to go for a drug deal. I looked at my sister, \"is this the right place?\" The inside is much different, ur typical mom and pop place. The people running it, including all the employees seem young with a hip hop vibe. Our server(maybe owner) even wore sweat pants with socks and sandles! (Lol) But hey, they make some decent food. Def don't let the outside scare u and give it a try. Will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent pho (it's all about that broth) and outstanding macaron ice cream sandwiches.  Clean dining area. Located in a strip mall. Owner stopped by our table and chatted with us. Plans to add new menu items and additional space in the future.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place. Ordered to-go because they were extremely busy at lunch time on a weekday. Super impressed. The pho had great flavor and everything tastes super fresh. I can see why this place gets such great reviews. About to dig into these macarons"}
{"text":"Now this place might not look like much from the outside however that's just a disguise. The pho here is fantastic.  I've yet to come across a pho place that I enjoy more in the Phoenix area.  I'm also a fan of their summer rolls, the steamed ones with pork, shrimp and peanut sauce for dipping.  They go by a different name every where I travel so figured I would describe them. Anyways, the broth is good, meat is good, price is good.  Hits the trifecta in my book."}
{"text":"This is literally a hole in the wall.  Today I had the medium special pho and shrimp and pork spring roll.  The pho alone was enough for lunch.  Both including tip was less than $15.  Not bad for lunch.  The broth is to die for.  It's a small joint and is easy to miss but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pho I've ever had! Massive portion, can easily split. I couldn't even finish mine! They give you a big plate of additives such as greens and bean sprouts. The meat was not cut up so I almost choked. I recommend taking smaller bites or cutting up the meat in the pho to avoid this problem. The spring rolls were also amazing! Definitely order them with the peanut dipping sauce, you will not be disappointed! So fresh tasting. The place looks like a dump inside and out, but the food is incredible, the workers are super nice and attentive, and the prices are fair! I highly recommend this place if you are in the mood for pho or spring rolls."}
{"text":"This place is great. Great service great food. Great atmosphere. I ordered the fried rice combo, chicken egg roll and pho w/ steak and meat balls. This is my 4th time here and it never disappoints. I highly recommend the fried rice combo. Best pho place in town hands down. Reasonably priced. If you are from here or visiting this place is a must."}
{"text":"I always come here with my family it's delicious. Service wise not the friendliest but they are quick and efficient. The actual facility is pretty dirty but overall the pho, macaroons and Thai tea are all great and good prices."}
{"text":"Best pho place in town. Good people! If your not there for the pho try the bomb macaroons or  macaroon ice cream sandwiches."}
{"text":"Only compliant is that the place is small and little raunchy, but the food is GREAT~!"}
{"text":"Authentic drinks and food. They provide an excellent variety of dishes with great lunch deals. My first course is always an order of spring rolls. I follow that with my main course being a vegetarian egg roll with noodles. Of course the innovative macaroon ice cream is a great finish."}
{"text":"I have made this place my weekly go to place. The pho in Glendale has really made me dislike pho but 43rd Express has redeemed pho for me. Their pho is that good. Also, I used to think BBH was not for me. BBH has been redeemed thanks to 43rd Express. They have now been my standard for comparing good pho to bad pho, for all phos, even back at home.  I always want dessert after Vietnamese food so 43rd Express is a one stop shop. I come on the weekend to stockpile on macaroons and depending on how much room I saved, I might eat two macaroon ice cream sandwiches (go away, I know they are big, but it is that good okay).   From my experience, pho restaurants want nothing to do with you other than you order, eat, pay, and get out, however this family is very friendly; all of them. They are smiling, chatting, or helping you if you have any questions (but for reals, I think if you shut your eyes and picked something on the menu, you will not be disappointed).   My only gripe is I don't like driving in this neighborhood and I think the roof paint originally used to be red, but the wretched Arizona sun has faded it pink... but hey, maybe that is their charm.  Overall, highly recommend. Great portions, great service, great dessert."}
{"text":"I LOVEEEEE this place. so many good selections"}
{"text":"Wow a Pho place with macaron ice cream sandwiches what a cool idea!!! They technically are two different stores in one bc if you order anything macaron related its not apart of your pho bill which was a little confusing but it's ok.    Pho all in all was very good as well, great broth and nice large portions for pretty cheap! It also cured my awful hangover almost instantly which just goes to show just how great the broth is.  I'm from Texas and never have I seen a bowl of pho for less than 7 dollars and here it was around 6 dollars I believe. I was in shock and if I lived in Arizona I'm sure you would find me here often."}
{"text":"I loved this place.  The service was attentive, the food came out hot and quickly which was great because I was on a lunch break, and the soup was amazing!! I opted for a different kind than my usual Vietnamese go-to of pho and tried a server's recommendation...I can't remember the name, but it was delicious broth, beef, shrimp, and fish cake with two different kinds of noodles.  It was sooooo good!  I also had to try one of their macaron ice cream sandwiches and it was to die for!  I will definitely be returning, quite possibly for the exact same meal!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great prices. Pho, macaroons, macaroon ice cream sandwiches, tea, service, I give two thumbs up for all!! I wish this place was closer to where I live, but it won't stop me from going.  I will say the portions here seem bigger-I normally can finish my whole bowl of pho and I couldn't here. I had leftovers. That's it. I want to say GO!! because it's so good, but don't go because I don't want lines out the door."}
{"text":"Love this place so much! I've been coming here since I was 14 and still come here every time I'm back in town to visit! I would recommend anything on the menu, literally everything is good"}
{"text":"Delicious Pho! My husband brought me here for the first time this last weekend and the food was scrumptious and customer service was excellent.  The Pho was so flavorful and the shrimp spring rolls were fresh and delicious with a sauce that is out of this world!"}
{"text":"This place is hands down the BEST Pho restaurant in the valley. From the moment when you walk in it is clean and the staff is very welcoming.  The staff is very attentive and they explain the menu items throughly.  My husband ordered #2 on the menu and I had their Pho Ga, we also ordered a side of their combination fried rice.  Everything was so tasty.  At the end of dinner Michael one of our servers came to check on us and we started chatting about the history of the restaurant.  He told us that it was a family owned and ran establishment.  He then recommended the taro macaroon with Thai ice cream which was delicious and the most delectable ice cream concoction I've ever had.  We were then surprised with a sample size of their creme brûlée and Nutella crepes and that was just as amazing! Visiting this place is a must!"}
{"text":"43rd Express is the definition of a hole in the wall place. The outside looks less appealing, the inside even less, but then the food comes out and you are oh so glad to be there. We ordered the steak pho and a pork dish that came with the broken rice, a sunny side up egg, and something else we couldn't really identify. It tasted a little fishy... not sure what it was, I wasn't a fan, but my husband seemed to enjoy it.   The pho broth was very flavorful and came with fresh basil and bean sprouts. The portion was more than enough and prices where very reasonable.   Don't forget to check in and get your free drink. I ordered the fresh orange juice, which in fact was fresh with pulp and seed. My husband got the fresh lemonade, which was very tasty as well."}
{"text":"Well Ive gone many times since my last updated review, I must say things have changed.  They have remodeled the interior, new tile floors, paint, granite top tables new seats.   Cleanliness is so much better.  Even the staff seems more friendly except for the tallest male server ( sorry no name tags).         I keep going back because I love the food"}
{"text":"43rd Express is a perfect example of a \"Hole in the wall!\" Hidden gem with AWESOME food! One of my favorite places for PHO! My husband now wants it on a regular rotation! PLUS, the Macaroon Ice Cream Sandwiches are HEAVEN!!! Makes my inner #FOODIE very happy!! The family that owns this place are very down to earth! It's like going to dinner at a friend's house! Love this place!"}
{"text":"The Pho is okay. Service could be faster."}
{"text":"best pho in town for the price :) the owners are very chill and will even converse and have small talk before and after you eat :)"}
{"text":"I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS RESTAURANT!!! everything is absolutely delicious. like. literally. I looooooooove the broth soooooo much. super tasty and flavorful. some places oh can straight up tell they're using a crap ton of MSG, but yo at pho 43, you are legitly eating pho made up with straight up beef broth. the owners are so friendly and helpful with everything! the drinks are super refreshing and fresh! esp the desserts. I believe it's called Che Ba Mau.... that thing is BOMB.Org. not even .COM. ITS ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL YO.  ok FORREAL doe. ima start talkin about them macarons. first of all. holy moly. ITS SO FRESH AND TASTY. some places its like wtf am I eating. colorful sugar circles?!?!?! Binh's Macarons are actually macarons!!!!!! I've eaten ones in California and I can tell you from the bottom of my soul and heart... that HER MACARONS ARE THE BEST IVE EVER EATEN IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE. LIKE IVE NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY EATING FOOD.    TLDR; pho 43 shits on other pho restaurants in Arizona. them macarons are the best on the planet earth. life is good, with pho 43 around. YEEEYUHHHH."}
{"text":"A must for pho. I just moved to az so I needed to find my regular pho spot. Being from Washington, D.C., I am exposed to a wide range of pho restaurants. From the overly Americanized pho to the very authentic pho. So I was so pleased to see a truly authentic pho restaurant.   The flavor of the broth is on point. The appetizers are delicious. The meat is tender.   On top of that, their service was quick and friendly!   This is my go to pho joint now."}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few Pho places in Phoenix and this is by far the best one I've been to.  I'm fairly loyal when it comes to Pho, if I've found one that's real good (such as this one) I'll stick with it unless there's some bad experiences...    I always get #1 SUPER DUPER.  Believe me, they're not kidding when they use these words.  The bowl is SUPER huge and they fill it up all the way to the top.  I've been here quite a few times and only ONCE I was able to finish it in one go.   The other item I get is spring rolls, very good size, tasty and the sauce is great.    Now there's a few negatives I like to point out about this place but it's not all bad.    1.  It gets crowded during lunch/dinner time and waiting on a table can be long.   2.  There's just not enough parking, I always end up parking in the back of the building...   3.  There's only one small bathroom 4.  Sometimes they close early (Sat/Sun) when they have a special event they need to attend.    Other than that, the food is great and the service is great."}
{"text":"Friendliest service I have ever received. Great Pho and their ice cream macarons are delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a local favorite of mine. I am a frequent visitor here.  I really enjoy the Guys, Kevin & Mike, & gals that run the family business.  I am a Pho-natic! The Pho broth is very good, one the best tasting of many of the Pho restaurants I have visited in Phoenix Metro.   The restaurant is very unassuming and not fancy at all. I believe is was a Taco Bell from days gone by.  The family works together to make the restaurant work. The food is fresh and very good.  They are great at recommendations or explaining items to you if you need a bit of help. Take the opportunity to ask questions, step out of the box and try something new. I go there to get my Pho fix.  They also have great espresso they import by way of California, it is very good.  They make a great Viet Coffee with it. They appreciate loyal customers who appreciate their small family business.   Give this place a shot, you will enjoy it.  Update: You have got to try the various flavors of Macaroons that Bihn makes.  We took two boxes of various flavors home, they are terrific.   They were once only available on the weekends but now you can place and order.  Look for the sign near the door or ask inside."}
{"text":"Love it here & totally worth the 30 minute drive across the valley. A total hole-in-the-wall appearance from the outside but the quality of food is fantastic! I get the shrimp pho & the egg rolls. Both delicious! I always get macaroons to go & an ice cream sandwich there. I think last time I got the red velvet with rocky road ice cream! Enjoyed and relished every bite."}
{"text":"The serving was huge and the food is great... My husband ordered pho and i ordered the rice meal, it tasted real good."}
{"text":"I have only come here for macarons so that is what gets 4 stars. I got a macaron ice cream sandwich (I think taro with cherry Ice cream filling). It was really awesome. I've had a lot of macarons and this is the best in the valley. The macaron itself is perfectly made from a pastry perspective- no crinkles, not hollow, and perfect feet. The ice cream isn't homemade but I didn't expect it to. And for a large macaron at $3.50, not a bad price. I'll definitely be back for that.  As for the pho, I have not had it myself but my family says that it is average but they would not return for the pho.  THat being said, definitely  come here for the macaron sandwich. It's crazy that in this ghetto cinderblock looking restaurant, I found the most perfectly delicate and expertly crafted macarons."}
{"text":"I'm never in this area so when I was yesterday, I had to stop by. I wanted to buy some macarons and when I came in and asked, I was given an order sheet to mark the flavors I wanted. I chose pistachio, taro, Nutella, chocolate, coffee, and raspberry. The colors on them were beautiful, especially the teal on the pistachio. Easy to order and I received my macarons quickly since they were in the fridge at the front. Good customer service.   Pistachio: didn't taste like it, more fruity but still good. Taro: don't know what it tastes like since I've never had it, but I liked it. Nutella: it didn't have a hazelnut chocolate taste, but I love chocolate so I enjoyed it.  Chocolate: my favorite, never lets me down. Coffee: good coffee taste, up there with the chocolate.  Raspberry: tasted fruity but not really raspberry-ish.  They had other flavors to choose from like fruity pebbles, strawberry, cookies and cream and more. I didn't get a chance to try the ice cream sandwiches but I will next time I visit! I really want to try their Thai iced tea flavors, since that's one of my favorite drinks."}
{"text":"So PHO-king good.  Yeah so not original, but it is what it is.  The Pho is the best.  I have tried the much acclaimed OB noodle house, and it's good.  Well, I thought so, but now I'm not so sure.  The depth of the broth at 43rd Express is ridiculous. I am convinced that they have been using the same starter for generations.  You can be the first customer of the day, or the last one in any day of the week and you will get amazing broth.  Not ok, not good, AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Took a while to get our server but once we got him he was awesome! David was pretty passionate and honest about the options on the menu and made pretty good recommendations. Portion sizes for the pho were pretty good. I was kinda sad we didn't get lettuce with our spring rolls but I should have asked. Haha..  The ice cream sandwiches were alright. If you love sugar cookies and ice cream, honey you get it! I recommend panna with coconut ice cream."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Pho I've had! It doesn't look like much from the outside, but this is one of those hole in the wall, diamond in the rough, true local treasures that should not be past up. Not only is the food amazing, but their macarons and ice cream sandwiches are equally as amazing. I've been raving about this places since I first ate here."}
{"text":"Oh my god. This is THE BEST pho I've ever gotten in my life. Been here few times already, (don't know why I haven't yelped yet, probably because I was too busy stuffing my face every time) and food is consistently excellent.   Food had so far; #1 (pho with everything), bun bo hue (spicy beef broth with noodles), egg roll, spring roll, crepes. Let me just tell you. They were all good.   If you are up for a challenge, get #1 super duper.   Now if you would excuse me, I'm going to stuff my face.  Try this place and see it for yourself."}
{"text":"Holy moly! Please stop by and try out their killer Bun Bo Hue. God I do not need to add any shrimp paste! It is clean and not oily!   Boys, we are eating well today!!  Phoenix! You hath won!"}
{"text":"Best pho you will eat in Phoenix. Being a recent resident of Orange County, I was really spoiled with access to Little Saigon and all it's fantastic pho options. I have tried nearly every pho spot in Phoenix and the West Side, and this one smokes the rest.  Pricing is fair\inexpensive (compared to Rice Paper, which was mediocre). Service was better than comparable pho restaurants, ambiance is very....authentic.....to most \"authentic\" Viet restaurants.  Had David as a waiter, and he made small talk and recommended the XL Pho Tai, which was a great deal considering the sheer volume of pho I ended up getting. He was kind enough to make a special half-order of egg rolls, and the food arrived quickly.  The bowl was ENORMOUS, and hot. The noodles were fresh, the meat was the correct type and sliced correctly. The broth was perfect, actually had onions\green onions\cilantro in it, and had all the correct side accessories (I didn't have to ask for a spoon, Hoisin, sliced peppers, lime, etc).  Egg rolls were on point, not refrigerated for days on end, and the filling was on-par with the real deal in Little Saigon.  I made small talk with David about the area and found out his parents own the place, and his recommendations were spot on. Well done! I will be back."}
{"text":"The best macron ice cream sandwiches! It was my first time having them and they don't disappoint.  This place was sooooo far from home but if I lived close by this would be a weekly thing."}
{"text":"I must say the Broth is amazingly delicious. N price is ok but some item are a lil high. Small spot n service is good also. Far from my area but id come bak if i were around again for sure. The biggest bowl is overly priced n not that huge though! A must try on the broth..."}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall restaurant, but has the best pho in Phoenix! No other place compares- Loves it! :) The staff is friendly and the avocado smoothie is yum!!!"}
{"text":"Food here is good. I mainly come here for the macaron desserts though. This place has the best macarons in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Friendliest owners out there!! Not only was the ice cream delicious, one of the owners even took their time to sit down, explain their inspiration behind the ice cream product. I was only in Arizona for a few days, but I would defined stop by here next time to get their pho... the smell was so delicious... I'm sad I came here with a full stomach and only the intention for dessert. You can get as creative as you want with the ice cream!"}
{"text":"Small, hole in the wall/mom-pop type of restaurant.  Very tasty broth and meat for their pho.  Good portion sizes.  Very reasonable prices and friendly service.  Simple menu, but contains items like Vietnamese crepes (Banh Xeo).  They do take credit cards now and they have lunch specials as well.  I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Really good food fresh and full of flavor , the kids love the grilled chicken ,Thai tea was excellent not too sweet, spring rolls and egg rolls were really good , the best macaroons and ice cream."}
{"text":"Soup was too sweet for me. Then, i tried grilled pork with white rice. I think the meat was pre cooked, came with soup, soup was nasty, so left it alone. would go there again just for the pho though. but other than that-prices are pretty cheap."}
{"text":"I loved all the food here, this is my third time dining here and it's been a complete delight"}
{"text":"This place looks a little scary from the outside, but don't let it fool you. Its very comfy inside. Parking is also not the greatest, so hopefully you find a spot next door.  Customer service was great, we got greeted when we walked in and were able to sit wherever we wanted.  We ordered pho #1 with 3 different types of meat and my boyfriend #10 with steak and meatballs. Both came out quick and steaming! It was delicious and super cheap each plate was around $7. The sizes were big and they are not stingy with the meat.   For dessert we got the macaroon ice cream. It was panda with dulce de leche. Very tasty. We were super full that we will have to come back for the teas and smoothies, oh and to try different macaroons!"}
{"text":"This is the best Pho in Phoenix, run by one of the coolest families in the West Valley."}
{"text":"I really like the food here. But I also like the staff they're really attentive and everybody has a great attitude. I've only been here once so far but I know I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times in past. Always order pho and spring rolls. Food is not too bad. I would come back if I still lived out here. Prices are a tad bit higher than other vietnamese restaurants but not too high. They must be doing something right this place has been around for many years."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!! Best place for Pho, so glad I came here. Family owned small joint but seriously outstanding flavor. Don't even get me start on the home made macaroons!!! If you decide to stop by you will not be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Best Pho in Phoenix and Az!!! Authentic Vietnamese food. Our usual order is the Super Duper Pho and Spring rolls. The vermicelli bowl, fried rice, chicken, and crepes are amazing too. You won't be disappointed and don't forget their amazing jackfruit smoothie and macaroons (Ice cream too :))   Coming from a Lao gal with a Hispanic fiancee.  You pay for the price you won't get anywhere else. They hook up the toppings in the pho bowl and making the spring rolls right :)  Been a customer since 2008"}
{"text":"The bowls are very large and servings are generous.  Excellent, friendly and speedy service!  This will definitely be our go to place Pho."}
{"text":"Very good pho   Check in and you get a free drink. I used to go to pho thang and I love it but they were always closed and I'm glad because that's how I found this place. Bad neighborhood great food."}
{"text":"This place was good. I must have gotten there at the right time, 11am. Once I sat down, the place started to get packed. I ordered a ca phe sua da, which was good! Then the Com Thit Nuong came on a medium sized plate. It was a little hard to eat because I kept losing rice on the table lol, but the pork was flavorful and moist, rice was a little on the dry side, egg was cooked perfectly, fish sauce was a little sweet, soup was ok but not the kind you usually get on the side of this dish. Overall, the dish was good. This place was worth a try for sure."}
{"text":"Not from the area. We found this place from Yelp. When we were in parking lot we were kinna wondering if this was really Vietnamese restaurant. Looks like hole in the wall. Food was amazing. Big portion and the servuce was very good. Next time I visit, for sure I'll be here again.   Bun Bo Hue I ordered was good but it tasted a little to much MSG. Still was good tho."}
{"text":"Great family owned restaurant, very friendly and kind. The prices are awesome and I love the fact they serve 3 spring rolls for the same price many other gigs charge for 2! I was introduced to this place by my fiancé, she's been coming to this place for over 5 years!  Their pho is amazing and cost efficient. Ask for their fresh made lemonade, it will rock your taste buds."}
{"text":"Ok so my first time here, we have passed it many times and every time it's packed and we go somewhere else... Luckily we came before it got packed... So its a small place pretty basic inside.. A little on the warm side but once you start eating you forget about all that... So my dish was #25 steamed rice with shredded pork and a pork patty which by the way honestly I was slightly hesitant to eat just by appearance but I'm a foodie so I took a bite and my goodness!!!! So delicious! I also had some pork on the side which I believe was grilled and jam packed with flavor! Spring rolls yes please! I was also given a side of soup which appeared to be a broth with green onions I'm not really sure but it was good! Ok so I read the reviews about the macarons with ice cream honestly I've never even had a macaron but I always wanted to try one just cause they are pretty... So I asked for a suggestion on flavors and I got a taro and thai tea ice cream... Goodness it was like heaven! I seriously can't wait to go back again and again... I think I found my favorite place... No I found my favorite place... And I believe I'm going to be addicted to the macroons..."}
{"text":"Wow!  Best Pho in Phoenix for sure. Broth is so intensely flavored I hardly had to or wanted to add anything to it. Also the best service we have had anywhere at any restaurant in ages. Super friendly and boxed our pho for us!  Also brought out cut chilled noodles for our baby. So impressed!"}
{"text":"Delicious Vietnamese cuisine! Their pho soup is very tasty and flavorful! I only eat at this restaurant for pho and bun bo hue!"}
{"text":"As I sat in Pho 43, I asked myself, \"who gave this place 4+ stars?\" I was seated immediately. There were 2 other tables eating. I got water in a dirty glass. There are no vegetarian options here. They will however add veggies for an extra charge. Well why not pay extra for what usually comes standard? Don't we all want less for more? I got a lukewarm Chicken Pho with what looks like synthetic chicken, I don't trust it. I'm serious.  I ordered lemonade and a get a glass filled with ice and 2 tablespoons of lemonade. This place is a waste. Mediocre service at best and it's dingy in here. Save your time and money."}
{"text":"I heard from my classmate that this place serves macaron ice cream during the weekend so I came to try it. I walked in and I was greeted by the people who work there or I'd say the owners ( I think it's a family owned business), so I asked if there's still  macaron ice cream left and the girl who helped me was the sister of Binh (the one who makes macaron). I got the taro macaron with pandan ice cream. It was very good; I will come back and try their food and different flavors of the macaron ice cream!"}
{"text":"The super duper size Pho is awesome! For $10 and I was no longer hungry monster. I love it! Best Pho in Arizona, period."}
{"text":"Great small restaurant spot! Hidden gem! We got take-out. Friendly, helpful staff and good, filling food. Delicious steak and brisket pho. The broth is so flavorful. We also have enjoyed the egg rolls and beef with rice dish. Finally, the macaroon ice cream sandwiches are a must try. They were amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was a toddler...literally. My first experience at Pho 43 Express was when I still needed a booster seat. I would probably say I was probably 4 at the time.   This is hands down...THE BEST PHO restaurant in Phoenix!. Period. It may be located in a not-so-pristine location, but if you're looking for a luxurious Vietnamese restaurant...then this isn't the place for you. Usually upscale Vietnamese restaurants in AZ feature the all-special...Americanized, bland, boring pho.  I can honestly say that I've never had a \"bad\" pho experience here. I'm sorry, but I haven't tried any of their other dishes, because I'm so addicted to the pho.  Be adventurous, try something else on the menu and let me know what you think. As for me, when I need a good pho fix...this is ALWAYS my go-to. :)"}
{"text":"Been going here since 2000 and it was the very first Pho place I went to I never had an issue the Pho is great and there are always ppl but I nvr had and issue with seating. When ever friends or family visit I take them here. Highly recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"im a truck driver and I travel around the country... i've eaten PHO in a lot a places and I can say this is one of the best."}
{"text":"Yummiest Pho ever! I've tried alot of places closer to work, to my house, etc. But nothing compares to 43rd. I'll go from my office to here to pick up dinner no problem. So worth it.  Everyone is so friendly and the prices are uncomparable for the quality and the flavor. Now the flavor. There is just something special about this broth. I could eat it alone without adding any if the hoisin or chile they provide to you. Not one single place I've gone to can touch their broth.  And the crèpes! Crispy and FILLED with tasty stuff inside. I can't remember seeing banh mi in the menu.  Would love love love if they would make and offer that too.  :)"}
{"text":"Don't pass this place up. The food is good but the taro Macaron with coconut pandan Icecream sandwich is out awesome! The best $3.50 we spent."}
{"text":"Went here with some of my friends for some dessert. Our goal was to try their Macaron Ice Cream, but decided to get some food as well. The food was good, but we werent really paying attention to the food. Then, finally dessert...yay! I got the Pistacchio Macaron and a Red Velvet Macaron with Pandan Ice Cream. They were yummy. They have a variety of macarons from Nutella, Lychee, Taro, Fruity Pebbles..etc. They also had a selection of Macaron Ice Cream and they give you 3 choices for the Macaron shell (Red Velvet, Taro, and Pandan..i think it was) and you can mix and match with a variety of ice cream from Coconut, Mango, Pineapple, Pandan, etc. It was definitely awesome on a hot summer day. Would definitely go back for it. The owners were pretty chill and made sure their guests were well taken care of."}
{"text":"First, I came to this place cause of all of the great reviews. Everyone was talking about the macaron binhs and I have to agree. I had the spring roll, pho, and macarons ice cream sandwich with rocky road ice cream. The rolls were good the flavors and the amounts of the ingredients worked really well together. The pho was good, there wasn't anything that was too special about the pho. However, it is definitely better than a lot of the pho I have tried. Now to the macarons, I have to say that the macarons themselves are great. But with the rocky road ice cream the macarons seem to get lost in the taste of the marshmallows. Nonetheless, I am giving this place 5 stars because of the service and the better than most taste of the food. Definitely coming back, especially when they get the taro flavor back for the macarons!"}
{"text":"It is always a pleasure and a great feeling to come to family business, with such great quality food that is irresistible even in this Arizona Heat Weather. Quality of service is always great \"take care of their customers\" owners are always welcoming and friendly"}
{"text":"Headed back  to California we looked up a pho place because it was raining.. As soon as i walked in there was a line and crowded inside so obviously thus was the place to be.  We were able to get seats pretty fast. This is a family owned Restaurant so its quite small. They should really expand because they are so popular. Food was delicious. Staff was. Cool. But the star here are the macaroon ice cream sandwiches. The macaroon itself is so moist and perfectly Baked. Its sucks though that day there was limited choices. Would definitely recomment this place."}
{"text":"From the start, we were greeted with awesome service. The place is far away and located in a sketch area. But don't let that turn you away! They are packed for lunch time hour. We ordered spring rolls and coffee with condensed milk. 3 spring rolls for $4.25 and $2.75 for a strong yet tasteful coffee that'll wake your taste buds! You cannot beat the price for the authenticity and service!   And then what's super special about this place is their homemade macaroons by Binh! Holy! We got to sample one of her most popular flavors - tiramisu! So many flavors to try. Had to buy a few! I haven't had really good macaroons since I was in Kali. (AND way better tasting than Whole Foods macaroons! - no joke!)   I hope to come back for pho and a rice dish AND more macaroons! :) thanks guys!"}
{"text":"By far the BEST Pho in AZ!! This is my go to spot. I love it and I always recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, best vietnamese restaurant i've been to! My now go to place for Pho, cheap, clean, good customer service and delicious food. I ordered Pho Tai & my boyfriend order the BBQ chicken and we were both happy with our food.  Plus got a free Thai Tea for checking in on yelp!"}
{"text":"The pho here is simply outstanding-- consistently delicious, light and aromatic and satisfying every single time! My husband dreams about the egg rolls, and we both love the macaroon ice cream sandwiches. Our favourite pho place in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"My favorite Pho place in PHX. The location is off the beaten path but it's well worth it. The noodles are amazing, and the desert is unbelievable! The make traditional macaroons in over 10 flavors, and the make these amazing ice cream sandwiches with the macaroons!! You have to try this place at least once. You will be hooked. It is small, family owned and once you try it once, you will be part of the family."}
{"text":"The food was awesome! The spring rolls filled with shrimp are a must. All of the food we ordered came out pretty quick and hot. The food itself looks simple, but the flavors in the broth is pretty amazing on its own, and you can taste the freshness as well. The wait can be long but definitely worth it. It's a small place, and the building isn't a marvel of architecture, but it adds to the lite atmosphere. The staff was very helpful and friendly, so if you have questions about the menu ask. They will give you guidance, and good recommendations. I always prefer any local hole in the wall and this place just jumped to my top 5. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"You don't have to be an elite yelper to know that this place is one of the best if not the best place to get pho here in Phoenix. My wife and I try different Vietnamese restaurants but believe me when I say Pho 43 stands the test of time and consistency throughout the years. The broth in the pho is like no other in the valley. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend have been coming here for years, the staff are super friendly and I'm pretty sure they know who we are since we go often. The food is amazing but we basically order the same thing ALL the time! My boyfriend always orders #10 and I always order the #24 we always come back for more, my boyfriend is obsessed with this place & so am I."}
{"text":"This is it! This is the only place you need to go to get your pho fix in az. I was skeptical at first because it looks like a hole in the wall but dont judge a book by its cover! Place was packed on a sunday night and the service was friendly and attentive.   I ordered the tofu pho and vegetable spring rolls and my husband got the meat versions lol. Food was all out within 10 minutes of ordering, very happy. Huge portions, this is one of the first places where they give you 3 fat spring rolls, usually its like 2 skimpy rolls so this was a good start to the meal. Peanut sauce was smokey and sweet with a nice creamy texture that complemented the crunch of the spring roll. Pho arrived and i was immediately hit with the deep roasted and spiced smell of the broth and herbs of the soup. Nice big portion too. So flavorful!   You can tell they take pride in their food and really do it right. Even the owner was going around checking on customers and refilling waters. They had fresh handmade macaroons too but we were too full to indulge, next time for sure. I will definitely be back and as long as they are consistent with the quality and flavor i experienced today, i will have  finally locked in my pho spot!"}
{"text":"Want a rice plate? A noodle dish? Eggrolls? or maybe one of the greatest bowls of Pho in Arizona? then head over to Pho43rd .. they have a straight forward menu which is great for lunch, especially for people like me that will read EVERYTHING and take forever to decide.. what i like about this place is the \"express\" it is fast because they have a select menu, that does not mean they have a limited menu, the food is amazing, and they chose the dishes that pretty much maximize flavor and timeliness.  I am not saying do not go for dinner, because you will be satisfied then too.  Oh, and if you savor great coffee like i do, when you order your iced coffee, ask for it in a to go cup =)"}
{"text":"Pretty good, a bit dirty and it definitely needs a new coat of paint on the front, but the food tasted fresh and the staff was very friendly. I'll go back when I'm craving Vietnamese in this area."}
{"text":"By far the best Pho I have had here in Phoenix. Dont judge a book by its cover . its GOOOD"}
{"text":"Wow, great Vietnamese food.  We had the veggie spring rolls and pho.  Both were excellent!  Honestly, if you like vietnamese food this is the place to go."}
{"text":"A combination of pho and macaron ice cream sandwiches? Sounds like a win-win situation. My sweet tooth was ushering me to give this place a try after seeing all the tempting macaron photos. The exterior of the building was on the shabby side, and certainly not located in the best side of town. Once I stepped into the restaurant, I knew they served authentic Vietnamese food. There was the traditional garnish for pho laid out on the tables: chili peppers, bean sprouts, limes, and Thai basils. They even have the little sauce dishes for the hoisin sauce and sriracha conveniently placed at each table.   I had the pho tai chin (#10) regular size, which was the beef noodle soup with steak and brisket. The broth was average, not too salty with adequate flavoring. I wished they trimmed the fat on my meat better as there were pieces of pure fat attached, which I had to literally remove myself. Maybe I have been spoiled by other pho places that have their meats nicely cut.   There is a separate menu for the macarons and macaron ice cream sandwiches. They offer three different macaron flavors for the sandwiches: pandan, taro, or red velvet. The menu had a lot of ice cream flavors crossed off, so we were limited to only three ice cream flavors and 2 added on special flavors (b-day & black cherry). Initially wanting to try the rocky road, I settled for the pandan macaron with thai tea ice cream. The pandan macaron was delicious! I can't say the same for the thai tea ice cream which lacked that wow factor. My boyfriend also had the pandan macaron with strawberry ice cream, and wasn't impressed with his ice cream as well.    The service could use some improvement. While we were dining in, all the workers were busy eating their mid-day meal/late lunch. No one was doing rounds to check up on the customers to see if they needed anything. We had to physically get up and approach them because they were so occupied with their meals; it felt like we were disturbing their mini break. It would be nice to have at least one person be open for full service.   They have affordable pricing, and accept card. The food was on the mediocre side, nothing spectacular that would pull me back. If I was close to this area, I'll probably stick to Pho Thanh on Camelback for my regular dose of pho. I might stop by to try their macarons again.   Remember to do a yelp check-in for a free drink!"}
{"text":"Came all the way from San Antonio, Tx to try this place. It looked sketchy af but it turned out to be one of the best places I ate at when I was in Phoenix. I would love to go back and visit soon."}
{"text":"I personally don't like pho but the macaroons at this place are amazing! They are so yummy ! When we come here to eat i get spring rolls and those are pretty good ! Everyone here is so friendly and helps you with whatever question you have. The food is great and the reason i know this is because my husband and friends we go with love this place. Delicious! Make sure to try the macaroons!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Vietnamese spots on the west side. I used to drive 45 minutes just to have their pho and macaron ice cream sandwiches.   Whenever I go to Vietnamese restaurants, I usually don't order pho just because it's better homemade. But whenever I go to pho 43 I always get pho. Everything I had here is very authentic Vietnamese. The staff is incredibly friendly and prompt.  I usually order the pho tai bo vien. All the macaron ice cream sandwiches are delicious. However, my favorite would have to be the cookies and cream macaron with cookies and cream or dulce de leche ice cream with Cinnamon Toast Crunch topped off with chocolate shell syrup. So tasty!"}
{"text":"I've never had Vietnamese food until my friend brought me here. My friend has been eating here for 20+ years and it's her favorite restaurant!  I eat a lot of Chinese food and Dim Sum, so I'm kind of used to eating authentic stuff (no Panda Express!). I had a rice dish with pork topped with a fried egg! It had fresh garnishments and it came with soup too. OMG! It was so good! It was very inexpensive too, maybe $6?  There were other Asians eating there and that's a real good sign of gauging if a place has authentic food.  The service was friendly and cordial. Excellent!  Anyhow, don't let the look of the place scare you away, as well as the neighborhood either. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Grew up in the area always seen the restaurant, but never made a stop in. About a week ago my boyfriend, best friend and I decided to pay a visit. Let me say it's not the nicest place in Phoenix, but the staff is so nice and the food is on point. I will definitely be back in for another bite."}
{"text":"First time having pho, besides david being extremely helpful and explaining EVERYTHING to me this is my new favorite place! Food is amazing! I'll be back soon !!"}
{"text":"The pho is good, but not the best I've had in the valley. It's a pretty far trek for me to come here, but what draws me in is when I have a craving for the macaroons and the macaroon ice cream sandwiches which are decently priced. I like that you get a free drink with a yelp check in, but I've had problems with what free drinks that includes since it was not very clear. The first time I was able to get soymilk for free and a couple weeks later I was informed after I ordered that it was not included anymore.  The broth for the pho is a hit or miss, the first time it was too salty but the second time I came it was perfect. The pork rice dish was good, but again it was not the best I've had and other places have this dish down way better."}
{"text":"My new favorite pho restaurant! Vietnamese food is my favorite food and I crave pho weekly. There really aren't any good pho restaurants in Tempe and phoenix. I used to always go to a different pho restaurant but now that I tried pho 43, I don't think I can go to any other pho restaurant. I wish they were closer to where I live, but I guess I'll just have to make the drive there. The meat quality is good and they give a good amount."}
{"text":"Pho is perfect for many things: as a meal, hangovers, cool weather and evoking feelings of nostalgia (IMO)  43rd Express has it down pat. Throw your preconceived judgements and feelings of the exterior and interior appearance out the window. After dining here twice already, it's the kindness of their service and flavor of food that keeps me coming back for more- you already know that a good portion are their macarons as well!  With the weather a bit cooler I decided to go with the Beef Ball and Rare Steak Pho and a Sam Bo Luong (sweet palm sugar drink with barley, seaweed, dried fruits and dessert beans). Unfortunately they were out of many drinks that day, so I finally settle with a Thai tea.  Yes, yes, yes. Their pho broth is still consistent and lovely as always, aromatic, savory, salty and slightly sweet. Love how they provide a generous helping of basil and bean sprouts. Their rare steak is always tender and the beef balls- I must admit ... my biggest pet peeve is when Pho restaurants have beef balls with the little bits of fat studded throughout. These did not have that at all, yay! Always a large serving portion here that is inexpensive even for a college student like me.  The girl helping us was so nice, to discount the meal since so many items were unavailable which was unnecessary but a great thought. She was also so kind and apologetic, but it was all so understandable.  Free drink off the menu with a check- in on yelp.  If there is a pho place you should try, it's this one!"}
{"text":"Okay so their Instagram page blew my mind. They always had pics of amaaaazing looking macaroons that were huge and colorful and I just had to check it out. A friend and I went on a Thursday afternoon and it wasnt very busy, the waiter was very nice to recommend his favorite bowl of pho and as soon as the food came I. Was. DYING. No joke this is the best pho in AZ, the broth was perfect, the meat was perfect, theres just something about it that made it....perfect! May seem like an exaggeration but hey I drove an HOUR from the east side for this place and would do it every week from now on as a ritual! You can imagine how excited I was for dessert! Only reason this place didnt get 5 stars is because they dont sell their good stuff on the weekdays. Like they only had an extremely limited amount of a macaroon selection and it was eh. I was hoping to get a crazy Captain Crunch rolled one or something so I was kinda bummed.  Still, ill be coming back for the pho regardless because this ish is divine."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with reasonable prices and good food. Don't expect anything glamorous in the way of decor, but service is very friendly and food comes out very fast.  They now have chicken pho, but I don't think it's on the menu.   The rare beef pho was delicious. What others have said about the fragrant broth is true. You could eat a whole bowl of just the broth.   I tried their coconut drink ($2.75) and it was amazing. You get a whole coconut with a straw and spoon for the flesh.   I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for no nonsense good pho in a clean, welcoming environment. It's very mom-n-pop.  Last note, they do take credit cards now via Square."}
{"text":"1st time in and ordered the steak and meatball pho and a the spring roll appetizer. The food was AWESOME, super stoked to have found this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I love the pho here and there spring rolls are the best all the employees are really nice and friendly and always welcoming"}
{"text":"I've had pho everywhere in the country, this is one of the worst, will never come back to this restaurant, soup was blah, too sweet not umammi, kinda greasy too, can not taste any flavor cloves or star anise"}
{"text":"Good food, great macaroons, ok service - place was super crowded and a little grungy and it was a long wait for the macaroons and our check.  Super reasonable prices for solid food though."}
{"text":"Just from my personal taste, it was okay. I prefer the place on 17th Ave and Camelback.   The staff was really nice. One thing that stood out was that they topped off my water, don't get that at the other place. I ordered the chicken pho. The coffee and condensed milk was better here. But the pho itself was where the 3 stars come from. For me it was too sweet and felt like it lacked something. The chicken was too chunky (usually not a problem for me lol.)   Overall I'm grateful I got to eat and I left full. Thanks Pho 43!"}
{"text":"I've been a few times and the food is consistently delicious!  My friends and I have had the pho, rice plates, noodles, spring rolls, smoothies and iced coffee. We haven't had a bad item on the menu :)   The family that owns the restaurant is super friendly and provide great service!    Today we tried the macarons!  Such a treat and so many different flavors!  We also had some creme brûlée and red velvet crepe cake that was pretty awesome.   All in all, a pretty great experience!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough! Amazing food! Service! Atmosphere! & pricing is perfect! Must try!!! The pho is the best out of the 20+ restaurants I've tried. Don't forget to try the macarons!!"}
{"text":"Love this pho! It was hard for me to find a place to eat pho, but this place was amazing! The people are so nice! And the ice cream they have is amazing! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This is another favorite spot of mine to have pho. Prices are a lil higher but the food is awesome. Definitely have to try the macaroon ice cream sandwiches they are a must!"}
{"text":"We have been here since we first moved to Arizona, which has been 9yrs ago. That says a lot about this place. Food is awesome and you cannot beat the prices here. The fried eggrolls is a must and definitely have the pho. We have since moved 30-40mins from here but whenever we come into phoenix area, we make sure to stop here. We have yet to find another pho place comparable to this place."}
{"text":"First time customer. I got pork with rice: the meat was thin and dry and the rice was over 2 days old - I took a bite of pungent mushy textured rice a few bites in :( Also tried Pho with brisket and didn't like the flavor. I'm still open to try Pho elsewhere but will not come back to this place. I was disappointed to find out the macaroons would only be available during the weekends."}
{"text":"Yeah this place is a great pho stop when I'm on the west side it's my go to spot for lunch, best viet coffee and the pho has been on point"}
{"text":"The guys at Grand Avenue Pizza (which I'm trying to get people to start calling The GAP) recommended a great pho place called 43rd Express. We went there the other day as their kitchen was closing, so they gave us free macaroons to express their condolences. They were like ice cream heroin. And their generosity cemented the place in our tastebuds, so we went back the following day. Great pho, all around, but the best part was the Egg Soda. I haven't found one of those in a while. I will definitely be coming here more regularly."}
{"text":"Affordable,generous portions,clean and lastly delicious!! The reason I'm not awarding it five stars is because the service could be a tad bit friendlier/better not once did we get asked if we needed a refill my mom was trying to wave a brother down for some water. The restaurant is family run and very humble the parking lot can be a pain the restaurant itself is tiny including the walk ways but at the end of the day your money is well spent the macaroons I've had here are the best I've had in my life so creamy and perfectly chewy and not too sweet their flavors to those macaroons are a unique Asian twist and those famous macaroons sold in that fancy Scottsdale boutique are a far-cry from these homemade babies. Goodness it's been 5 days since I've been here and I cannot stop thinking about them. The pho is delicious as well very well balanced and spiced. Two steak and briskets phos/order of spring rolls and fried pork rolls with 2 drinks and 6 macaroons will set you back at 45 with a tip included. I will definitely go again I'm hoping their service improves but it's not a big deal it's family owned so more power to them. The food is that good. I will continue to come as long as I don't have any bad experiences here."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. I really like that it is a family owned and operated restaurant. The food is fantastic and the service is great! I especially like one of the owners name David, he is extremely friendly and helped me order my food as I was not familiar with the cuisine. Even if you are not a dessert person you need to try the macaron ice cream sandwiches they are the best I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Super delicious, family owned restaurant. Went on a Sunday, and the place was packed. We were able to get seating, but saw people waiting outside hungrily. At first we were a little skeptical with the service. It took some time to get our orders in and even have our waters brought to us. But the son of the owner took notice of this and immediately remedied the situation right away, making sure the rest of our time there was spent with attentiveness. Very appreciated! We started out by ordering the Iced Vietnamese coffee. We had two separate orders and they both came out with a teacup contraption and a cup of ice. I studied it skeptically and realized that each teacup had individual espresso dripping for your drink into the bottom of condensed milk- in front of you. So cool! The taste? Strong as hell, and absolutely divine! Next came the Pho. I once told my boyfriend that you can tell if pho is really good in a restaurant if the meat is literally, cooking in the broth. I definitely saw that with some of the meats; we ordered the Dac Biet Xe Leua which included everything: Steak, Flank, Brisket, Tendon and Tripe.  Finally, the infamous macaroons! My boyfriend ordered the regular macaroons, Thai Iced Tea flavored, and I ordered the ice cream macaroon sandwich, Strawberry and Taro. My sandwich was so big, I opened my mouth to take a big bite and hurt my jaw! Um, worth it.  We talked to the son of the owner and found out they had been in business for 20+ years, always busy he told us. His mom found the restaurant and he'd been growing up helping run it since he was a tot.  All in all, our delicious coffees and pho came out to about $20. We were charged for the macaroons separately. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for cheap eats and who supports family business, and lovers of delicious food!"}
{"text":"Affordable great Vietnamese good along with macarons and ice ram macarons!  Anything from the pho to the rice dishes or the appetizers are winners.  It's a family owned restaurant so it's not some big franchise.   I've tried many items on the menu and haven't been disappointed."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the run down, small building/parking lot exterior. This hole-in-the-wall type shop was packed when I came here on a Sunday afternoon - and now I can understand why.   The food was amazing. The Pho broth so clear and tasty and full of noodles and meat. My \"small\" bowl was over-flooding with food I could barely mix things around.  I wasn't even able to finish it. But that might also be because we ordered Spring Rolls and regular fried egg rolls as appetizers (couldn't just choose one!) So glad we didn't. The spring rolls were beefy, not just the meat, but in size. The egg rolls were super hot and crispy. I was pretty impressed.   And whats a meal without dessert? They sell regular macaroons and ice cream macaroons. We just got a few of the regular macaroons ($1.75/each) to taste test but these are by far the best macaroons I've ever had.  Servers are nice and fast. The inside was clean, just small. So if you're planning on bringing a huge party, that might not be the best idea.   Environment: 4/5  Food: 5/5 Price: 5/5 Service: 5/5"}
{"text":"Easily one of the best bowls of Pho in America.  Pho is about the broth. 43's broth is stupid rich without being heavy at all. If you're the type that adds sauces to your pho do yourself a favor and try it without them before you go crazy with the Sriracha and hoisin. There's no way any less than 10 hours goes into getting this bowl to your table. Take a moment to enjoy it as is.  Oh and about that table, you may have to wait. The place is cozy and welcoming but at about two o'clock in the afternoon on a Saturday there were no tables available. The wait is worth it.  Do not leave without taking a look at the macaroon menu. The PB&J, green tea, and birthday cake macaroons are insanely good."}
{"text":"Wow! Super good. They know the local tastes because the pho comes with a whole cut up jalapeno and 2 cut up limes. This is a barrio secret that focuses on good food. So good it's almost packed at 2pm on Monday."}
{"text":"Family owned. Great customer service & awesome food  I feel like family every time we go there"}
{"text":"Best food in the PHX! been going there for almost 15 years."}
{"text":"Great good & really good service. Great prices. A simple menu, but all you need. A welcome variety in the neighborhood. Lots of native Vietnamese; so that's a good sign . Close to work, so will return again & again."}
{"text":"Found my new favorite Vietnamese eatery today! Beats all other Pho places I've tried. Amazing food, great customer service & great prices!! Delicious eats! Like I read another review, \"Diamond in the rough\"."}
{"text":"The MACARONS are to die for!! I haven't tried their pho here, but these are the most amazing macarons and macaron icecream sandwiches I've ever had-and I've tried MANY places. I've tried ice-cream macaron sandwiches from  famous places like MILK in LA, and macarons from multiple upscale bakeries like Sucrè, as well as macarons in Paris where it all started, and these are still my favorite!! Not only have they nailed the chewy consistency, but their flavors are the most unique that I have seen anywhere. I love that they also have an Asian twist with flavors like Thai tea and taro, and my all time favorite flavors are the taro and fruity pebbles! When you get the ice-cream sandwich it is also customizable and you can build it with your choice of cookie, ice-cream and dip that you want it rolled in, where the options are mainly cereals like Cinnamon Toast Crunch and fruity pebbles. I absolutely love this place and have been coming here for a long time for walk-ins and for special orders! They've made designs like elephants, pigs, and turtles for us, and they're always so easy to work with, so go support this lovely local restaurant!!"}
{"text":"After hearing about their macaron icecream sandwiches we just had to go check it out! Their beef over rice, vermicelli, and shrimp fried rice was delicious but the pho was oily and the steak wasn't tender, it was thick and hard to swallow. But the dessert tops it off, if it wasn't for the dessert it would be a 3 star for me!"}
{"text":"Delicious GIANT bowl of Pho that hit the spot. The herbs and bean sprouts were super fresh. The Pho broth was perfect and there was so much steak that I couldn't finish it all. The crunchy eggrolls were very tasty too! Accompanied with fresh crunchy lettuce and herbs. We finished the meal with their insanely delicious macaron ice cream sandwiches. They are seriously out of this world. Service was great too! You just have to get past the not so pretty exterior because the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Staff was gracious and made solid recommendations. Meatball and steak was my choice. Lemonade and club soda is the most refreshing drink on a PHX day!"}
{"text":"Tasty, cheap, has a number in the name. Checks all the pho boxes. Best one we have tried in phx coming from LA."}
{"text":"Com Tam Bi Cha Suon Nuong Trung Chien (Rice Dishes #23): Menu description: Broken rice w/ shredded pork, steamed egg, BBQ pork chop & pan fried egg This was a large, delicious dish with a variety of flavors for a great price ($7)! I occasionally poured fish sauce over this dish and enjoyed everything on the plate. The BBQ pork chop was tender and flavorful. The shredded pork wasn't as flavorful, but added a nice texture to the dish overall. The steamed egg and pan fried egg were delicious, and I mixed bites of those with rice and pork. The cucumber and pickled carrots on the side added a refreshing crunch in between bites of everything else on the plate. This also came with a small bowl of broth, which I assume was their pho broth. That was a perfect addition, as I was craving some pho but didn't want to order a whole bowl. The portion size of this is quite large, and it definitely filled me up. Overall, the variety of flavors and textures on this plate is great and cheap! I would definitely get this again.  Che Ba Mau (Beverages #17): Menu description: Sweet Red Bean, Topped W/ Mung Bean, Jello & Coconut Milk I got this for free from the Yelp check-in offer! This was more like a dessert than a beverage. The bottom 75% this consists of sweet red beans, and this is topped with green jello and coconut milk on top. This wasn't bad per se, it's just not something I would order again. I personally thought it was a bit too sweet, and I was expecting more of a liquid-like drink than something so solid. I left this mostly uneaten, mostly just because I was full by the end of the meal. Try this if you like sweet desserts or red beans.  Macaroons: I just got two regular (non ice-cream) macaroons, since I was very full by the end of my meal. The raspberry and strawberry flavors I tried were delicious! The flavors were actually intense and sweet without being overbearing. I definitely want to try an ice-cream version next time!"}
{"text":"So I went here because of all the awesome reviews..... and was not really disappointed. I ordered #25 which was rice wit seamed egg, fried egg, pork, and some veggies on the side. It also came with some sauce and some soup....The guy there was super helpful in explaining what the sauce was for. The yelp offer for a free drink was used on the coffee and it was so good! Served with a cup of ice to pour it into and enjoy. Which I definitely did. They did have one fried rice, which I was debating on but decided on my meal based on everybody's reviews saying how amazing it was. And it was pretty good. I took half of it home and had it for dinner (it was a lot of food) The total came to $8.40 which is a little higher than most places I've been where I have had drink and food come to that... I will likely be back, and hopefully save room for the cookie sandwich next time!"}
{"text":"Every time I go on a Sunday a little past lunch time, they've run out of their macaron ice cream sandwiches!  So my advice is to actually go early or at a reasonable time for lunch on Sunday if you want to avoid missing out on these delicious desserts.    I've had the red velvet w/ Thai tea ice cream.  Sooo good.  I'm no macaron connoisseur, but it had just the right amount of firmness on the outside and soft gooeyness on the inside, which held up well as the end pieces of the contained ice cream.   I will definitely be back for these!  The free drink from yelp check is always welcome!  and the vermicelli w/ grilled pork was delicious."}
{"text":"Before moving up North, I used to come all the time to this place because my family knew the owners and it used to be near my ex-hairstylist. This is where I realized my intense, borderline dangerous love/addiction for Vietnamese deep fried egg rolls. After eating here, no other place could rival 43rd Express. My family and I always got the same things: pho, egg rolls and spring rolls, and a good ol'  rice dish with pork. I remember how I would just stare at the broth that came with the pho, mesmerized by the big and fatty bubbles that appeared next to the thinly sliced beef and beansprouts floating in all of it's glory. I used to drink that stuff up, as unhealthy as I now realize it to be but I believe that we all need to live on the edge every now and then. Big portions, small prices. Unfortunately, my family switched hairstylists and it just so happened to be conveniently next to Da Vang which is where we go to get our fix now because 43 Express is out of the way. Something about hairstylists within a pho vicinity seems to be a reoccurring pattern for us.   Yes, I agree, this ain't no glamorous place. I remember the occasional annoying fly in the restaurant, the non-existent Asian service, how we always had to wash our chopsticks and spoons in water at the table before we ate, and the mis-matching decor but honestly, the crappier the service/decor inside an Asian restaurant, the better it always tends to be anyways. Hey, no one said we were a perfect race.   Get takeout if you're that picky about interior, but technically, if you already decided to make the trek to this sketchy part of Phoenix, might as well just dine there. If you're used to Da Vang, change it up and try this place out if you don't mind the distance!"}
{"text":"Oh man! It was my husbands & I first time eating pho and we came to \"pho 43\" it was beyond delicious , from the soup to the egg rolls & even the macaroons ! (My husband got the ice cream sandwich and loved it) so yea we would deff be going back to this place"}
{"text":"My first time to this place. Pho didn't taste good, l did spice it up but still the same. I will not be going back to this place. Also , they are a little pricey than the others considering their location."}
{"text":"I'm so glad my boyfriend introduced me to this restaurant. The first time I came here I fell in love with their food. I love their rice dishes, appetizers, desserts, and most importantly their pho! Gahhhh their pho is the best I've ever had. It's all about their broth. It isn't watered down like most viet restaurants have them. It's made to perfection. So delicious I don't even need to add anything to it. I used to always eat here once a week with my bf. Before work or on my days off. It helps that he also know the people that own this place cause they always know how to take care of us. Keep up the good work guys : ) oh and don't forget to try their ice cream macarons!! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Welcome to your new addiction. I LOVE Pho 43. I come here every week without fail. I've never tried anything that wasn't amazing and they have, hands down, the best pho in the valley (and I've tried everywhere)! The staff is all so welcoming. They will treat you like you've been friends forever after your second time in.   The macarons are an absolute must have. They're the best macaron you'll ever put in your mouth. No joke."}
{"text":"Ok, expect a crowded area. You aren't going here paying for ambiance. The pho was UNBELIEVABLY GOOD. We ate for under 20$ and it lasted several meals. The spring rolls were Devine. The shrimp was fresh, lettuce and Thai basil-so fresh. The employees were friendly. There was no language barrier for allergy free ordering. I tried #38. Banh Xeo; a half order of a Vietnamese crepe. Heaven. I can not wait to get it again. Thank you Pho 43 Express!!"}
{"text":"What a tremendous find in the Central West Valley. We discovered this place after being awarded one of the Top 20 Restaurants in the Business Journal. We love Phó and this place makes it amazing! Let's not forget their wonderful desserts....French Macaroons stuffed with Rocky Road Icecream. We just added this place to our regular list."}
{"text":"Now this is what I call a Vietnamese restaurant. After going to a frou frou place in the east valley a couple weeks ago, this was a welcome change. This place is very much like the pho restaurants I frequented in Seattle.... kind of small, nothing fancy looking, strong pho smell upon entering.... great. I got my free drink with check in (how awesome is that?), iced Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk, which was very sweet, but delicious. Certainly a treat. I had the pho tai (steak), which tasted like a high quality pho with tender thin sliced steak (it even tasted great the second day). The husband got the pork and rice lunch special, which was tasty and came with a great little salad (that I stole). Of course, we had to get an ice cream sandwich... unfortunately they were out of the Thai tea option, but we got taro cookie with pineapple/coconut ice cream.... it was refreshing and delicious. Totally worth the 3.50$ price tag (and the calories!). 43rd express, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Worse place for Vietnamese.  The pho broth was tasteless.  The place was run down and dirty.  I felt sick after eating here.  There are plenty of good Vietnamese restaurants in the valley.  Don't bother with this joint.  It's not worth getting shot at in this ghetto neighborhood.   Check out Pho Van in Chandler or Unphogettable in Mesa."}
{"text":"Pho- good Spring rolls- good Macaron ice cream sandwhich- on Point.  They were pretty busy but were able to balance and maintain good customer service. I'll be spreading the macaron ice cream sandwich gospel, that's for sure."}
{"text":"What took me so long to try 43rd Express?!  The staff was very attentive and explained to us that we didn't have to stick to the combos, but mix and match items if we wanted to.  I had heard about the macaron ice cream sandwiches so I was very eager to try one.  I ordered the red velvet macaron with chocolate chip ice cream in the middle.   It was so good!!  I recommend eating it right away before the ice cream starts to melt.  The texture is chewy and true to the flavors you choose.  A lot macarons these days are just sweet, but this place does it right!  The owner must have seen how excited I was because he gave my husband and I each regular macaron on the house!  I thoroughly enjoyed their customer service.  Since this was our first visit to 43rd Express, we were shown how to eat the dishes by pouring a special sauce over the meal.  My dish came with a fried egg, which was cooked the way I wish all eggs would be cooked.  You can see what I mean by some of the pictures posted on Yelp.  The fried eggs are crispy underneath and around the edges, and is just so perfect.  The entree I ordered came with a bowl of broth on the side.  The flavor rich and comforting.  43rd Express is now my go-to Vietnamese restaurant in town.  Five stars!!"}
{"text":"Selections are good, you get a pretty big size bowl of pho that will fill you. I also had spring rolls, they were fresh and good. Prices are comparable to other locations. I go here to get my pho fix. Pretty big restaurant and eating area is clean."}
{"text":"OMG where has this place been in my life? The Vermicilli with egg on top?  Wow.  Clean, fast service & so tasty."}
{"text":"I've been coming here ever since my friend took me... four years ago? Now, my husband and I come here once a week.   We usually get the same thing but that's because we're creatures of habit and because it's freaking delicious. We both get the number 43, which is a vegetarian dish with noodles and crispy spring rolls. We hook it up with all the spice and sauce, with a side of thai tea (for me) and sam bo luong (for John). It's also hard to resist the macaroon ice cream sandwiches at the end of every meal.   It's been awhile since we had anything else besides our usual dishes, but I'm 100% sure that everything else on the menu is the best Vietnamese food you'll ever have. Just my opinion, don't get crazy.  The restaurant is run by family and friends whom are all friendly people. You won't get more a filling meal for the prices they have anywhere else. Trust."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. I had the rare beef pho, as well as the spring rolls. As many have mentioned before, the broth was incredibly fragrant, just perfect.   I was excited to visit this place for the first time due to all the great reviews. I do have to say, however, that the service that I received was less than great. I told them it was my first time visiting and I just got a blank stare and was handed a menu, no offers to help or anything. Since I have read on here that the service is great, I was a bit disappointed. I am willing to chalk it off as \"just one of those days,\" so I will try again since the food is great."}
{"text":"Amazing! I have tried about 4 different dishes everything, I mean everything is delicious, fresh, and flavorful. The staff is so friendly and helpful. I will be a lifetime customer."}
{"text":"I used to eat here often when I used to live on that side of town. This restaurant is run by mostly young adults but they are friendly and attentive to the customers.  The pho has nice flavor and the best part is it came out piping hot. However, the meat was little dry and the tripe was way over cooked to a point it was slimy :(. The bean sprouts and herbs came out very fresh and clean. The crepe had nice crunch and was delicious. I wish the dining room was little cleaner too. Most of the tables were out of napkins but they were packed for lunch.  I think the best part of this restaurant is the dessert. The macaroons were quite tasty. The taro root ice cream macaroon (don't know why it was green) was not so sweet and was very good. Most dessert was in the shape of hearts in celebration for Valentine's Day. I'd come here just for the dessert. Three stars for the food but extra star for dessert."}
{"text":"Great place!!!! The amount of people in there for Pho might surprise you. Fresh Pho and fast service. Good portions for the buck. Staff friendly and manny many choices."}
{"text":"I had high hope for this place especially with the stars and reviews.I came today for my first time wanted to try the pho and someone mentioned in a past review that it was sweet I have to agree the beef pieces aren't that thin one piece actually had a little fat.Had to ask for my basil and bean sprouts I will just stick with Pho Thanh and De vang for authentic Viennese food."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. It's busy but the cooks in the back know exactly what they're doing. I came from Orange County (Lil Vietnam area) and ate pho 1-2 times a week. This is the only place out here that I recommend to my friends. My family eats here almost every week.   Even if you're stomach is empty you won't be able to finish their super duper bowl of pho. It's crazy stacked.   Much love to this place. Hope they stay open forever."}
{"text":"I have eaten at at least 20 other Vietnamese restaurants in Phoenix metro, on East and West sides, and in Mesa, including Pho Tranh, Little Saigon, Noodles Ranch, Phoenix Pho Vietnamese, Sui Noi, too many to list.  Pho 43 is up there in taste.  The Pho 43 broth may be better than Da Vang at 19th Ave and Camelback, but to me #1 favorite is Da Vang because their price is about 25%- 35% LESS than any other vietnamese restaurant.  And Da Vang has a huge menu.  (Update April 2018, Da Vang raised their prices to meet the other aforementioned restaurants.)  Taste of food at least 4 stars for Pho 43, but I am giving Pho 43 3 stars because of three things.    1.  Deficient service - When I arrived, my server did ask me what I wanted to drink.  I said ice water with lime wedges I can squeeze in my water, and Splenda packets.  But he forgot to bring my water.  I had to ask for it when I was almost done with my food almost an hour later, so you know he forgot, not just \"slow\".  Also, when I was almost done with my pho, it suddenly struck me that other tables with pho had sprouts and basil on their table, but I did not.  I asked another server, \"Aren't I supposed to get the sprouts and basil with my pho, like the other tables have?\"   He said yes.  By that time, my soup was cold, and nothing much left in my bowl to put the sprouts in, so I asked the other server who brought me water, to pack my sprouts and basil to go.  Later, at home, I sauteed the sprouts and basil with beaten eggs and shrimp and put that in a tortilla with hoisen sauce, for a sort mooshoo scrambled egg wrap.  Really delicious for breakfast!    2.  Price is about 30% more than Da Vang., e.g. same bowl of pho, same ingredients $5.25 at Da Vang, $7.50 at Pho 43.    3.  Physical condition of restaurant - I had to move many chairs around to find a chair with a seat pad that wasn't cut and slashed, or like rat ate a hole out of the cushion.   Also some chairs rocked, as some of the legs were shorter than others.   Looking around, seemed about 40% of the chairs had marred, cut up, chunks missing seat pads.   Da Vang's tables and chairs look new."}
{"text":"If you are in the Phx area and need some good Vietnamese food this is the only place to go.  It's delicious every time!  You can never go wrong with the pho and some spring rolls."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place! I come here at least once a week and I really don't care if I come by myself and eat alone - it's just that good. The staff is cool, the food is incredible and the macaroons are on point. Best Pho  in town!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. The quality of meat was so good! The tendon was awesome. The steak melted in my mouth. I'm definitely coming back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Ok so after my last review (4 years ago) I decided to go back solely because of all the hype of their macrons. (I'm a sucker for those things!!) went in, tried their  ice cream macron and they were awesome!! Extra star for amazing customer service and awesome macrons. Will definitely be back again! Oh and they use the square reader now for cards!"}
{"text":"Very small hole in the wall family owned Pho place.  As a huge pho eater, I have to say this is one of the best Pho places in Phoenix. Price wise, it is very inexpensive. The broth is chicken so it tastes a bit sweeter than most pho broth, but nevertheless its very well made.  I didn't taste any MSG in my broth like some of the other pho restaurants I have been to.  Their goi cuon and bi cuon is has less noodles in it which is exactly how I like mine made.  Their macaroon is a huge hit.  It is super fresh and it runs out pretty quickly.    My only complaint is this place isn't closer to where I live.  I been looking for an authentic pho restaurant ever since moving to Phoenix from Dallas a year ago... and it looks like I might have found it."}
{"text":"43 express is terrific. The service is amazing, and the food is, too. The smoothies were really fruity, and the pho tasted amazing. We will definitely be back. The menu is really reasonably priced, too!"}
{"text":"Pho is so delicious! Their ice cream macaroon sandwiches are to die for!!! Service is amazing! Will definitely be back whenever in phoenix!"}
{"text":"Oh Wow - SO yummy. This place is quite packed for lunch, but totally worth the wait. Wonderfully prepared pho with tons of meaty/veggie flavor. The extra basil and toppings were so fresh. We also enjoyed the fresh spring rolls. Yum - I  cannot wait to drop in again."}
{"text":"Bun bo hue and cafe sua da fan!!!"}
{"text":"Oh, I thought this place was called Pho 43.  This is your typical hole in the wall kind of place but they serve up some really good Pho bowls.  It seems very family-oriented ran.  Spacing Inside and Parking is somewhat limited. Fast service.  I would go back."}
{"text":"Dropped in for some Pho with a friend for dinner. The place is small , and dirty, our table was not cleaned, it was wiped down, still food on the condiments tray and on the table. The food to me was definitely was not even  close to what the  ratings on here stated. Maybe an off night not sure, different cook. Something was definitely off. In summary I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"It's really damn good. I was recommended by some friends to go to this place. I had the steak and brisket pho and it was amazing. The prices are pretty cheap for the amount of food you get too. The only problem is that sometimes it's too packed and you gotta wait outside. It's understandable though seeing how good it is."}
{"text":"I'm a regular there, I go every Thursday's and Friday's and after a long weekend end up there on Sunday's. Great Pho just delicious from top to bottom! Spring rolls are a MUST have each time!!  Oh also there coffee there with concentrated milk!!

{"text":"Hands down the best pho I've had in Arizona. The portion size, flavor, and price is unbeatable. I heard about this place from a friend and drove 30 minutes to try it and it was well worth it. I recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Amazing place and great service. The Macarons are delicious. Omg so so good every bite was so amazing it was like a party in my mouth. That's how good it was. New favorite place to enjoy food and ice cream. Love it."}
{"text":"Can a Pho 43 open up in Central Phoenix, please? This is pho is DELICIOUS! What a gem. Great service, huge portions, broth is on point! I don't know what else to say other than EAT HERE!   Side note: LOL to all the Yelpers who think this is a \"rough\" part of town. It's not. GEEZE."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for pho and spring rolls in the valley. Food is quick, fresh, and delicious! You will wait to be seated if you come anytime during peak and they will be out of several popular menu items if you come anytime past the afternoon. By 2pm they were out of chicken pho and by 3pm they were completely out of macaron ice cream sandwiches. Because the place is small and busy you don't really feel like you can linger or take your time and converse with friends, although they personally don't make you feel like you need to rush. Go early and if you have the opportunity get a macaron ice cream sandwich. I love the taro sandwich with pandan ice cream. Try the chicken and rice with egg lunch special too!"}
{"text":"It's been almost a year since there was a review about this place.   I thought this place was pretty affordable and cheap compared to other Pho places here in AZ. Large portions too.   I had their #15 Pho, meatballs and sliced beef. The broth tasted like chicken or like those Pho broths from the can you can buy at Asian supermarkets. I pretty much drowned it with hoisen and chili sauce just to make it almost taste like the Pho most people know. The bean sprouts they gave us were kind of dry and still had the \"little brown roots\" on the end. Never saw that before in a restaurant. The meat didn't look too fresh either.  The restaurant is on the small side, but is spacious. I found the Boss Lady sitting at one of the back tables facing the whole dining area a little creepy. Their waitress looked like she just woke up and rolled out of bed! Lol. Omg, a minute into having our food served, I heard someone clipping their nails! I was tempted to look around but I was afraid I would totally lose my appetite. Gross. Do that at home. Not at your restaurant.   I'm not so sure if I would go back. I probably only will if I was really really REALLY craving for some Pho, and it's the only one near my work.   They are closed on Tuesdays and is Cash Only."}
{"text":"The food is Bomb! Super authentic incredible flavor every time. We come at least once a week we can't stay away! Ask for their Toffu veggie pho and add shrimp! So delicious!"}
