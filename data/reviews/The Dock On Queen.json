{"text":"The atmosphere is like being in Muskoka or Georgian bay without leaving for the cottage. Its brand new. Smells great with Douglas fur floors from a schoolhouse up north. The coffee is roasted in Sudbury or someplace like that. Its a board game cafe soon. The only real board game cafe in the east end.  Loads of games. Its not as huge and reconfigured like snakes and lattes but its cheaper than that place and located in the east end and looks like a cool wooden cottage cabin. Plus they now have live music and a bigger tv screen to watch sports. Its cool vibe laid back and i think as a board games cafe and cafe and cabin in the woods in the city its different. Lots of Internet workers and fast Internet free access."}
{"text":"As if Leslieville needs yet another coffee shop, right eh? Wrong! There is beer! (Currently just Left Field and Side Launch, as well as Brickworks cider.) There is TV! There are too many electrical receptacles for all the gadgets you brought! There is also live music, but hey, I normally judge a bar based on whether there are televisions installed on premise.   I think I may have found a new go-to place in the neighbourhood to chill, get some work done, get a board game going, and simultaneously watch a ballgame on a large TV while sipping a latte (or for that matter, beer). This cottage themed new cafe in town won me over on its comfortable all-welcoming environment and equally chill staff, but most importantly the ability to execute the aforementioned scenario. The Dock on Queen is basically as I look at it, kinda like Boxcar Social for more laid-back folks and those who want to be able to watch a ballgame while sipping a latte, for there are not many cafe-type places where you can do that.  Food-wise, they got some sandwiches and the usual cafe grub, including Desmond and Beatrice cupcakes, and numerous vegan-friendly goodies. Heck, they were eager to get me to sample some of it.  I guess it's supposed to feel like a funky cafe you might find in a cottage country town. The Dock has designed itself as a momentary escape from the city without actually leaving it, for those who like me don't get to go up to the cottage every long weekend."}
{"text":"Quaint tea and coffee cafe with nice sweets. Comfortable seating with interesting decor and paintings.  I also was really happy that they had nice music playing but it wasn't blaring."}
