{"text":"Was excited to try Naber's tonight since we had been a fan of the previous restaurant at this location. We were seated right away and ordered our meal shortly after arriving. It took 40 minutes for our sandwiches to arrive & when they did, one was completely cold, one was missing the fries & one meal was totally missing. We continued to wait & finally called for a manager. The person at our table whose meal was complete was unable to eat because our table had no place settings.  The manager finally arrived, apologizing & said that we would not be paying for our meals. She offered complimentary dessert but we declined. We finally received our meals which were ok but nothing special. The waitress left our ticket which was for over $70 to pay for everything. We again called the manager who apologized & said it would be take care of. When the new bill arrived, they had removed the cost of 2 sandwiches so the total was almost $50 now. Wen I asked the manager (again), I was told that they removed 2 sandwiches which is what she had agreed. I told her that only one meal had been correct and she grabbed the bill, told me that they would comp the entire bill & huffed off without any other apology. We eat out about 3 times a week and have never had an experience like this. This was our first & last visit to Naber's."}
{"text":"We really excited for the Bloody Mary bar they advertised on weekends. We got there Sunday around 10:30, and the hostess told us they didn't open until 11. We verified they served breakfast and had a Bloody Mary bar and her response was \"oh yes absolutely\". So we decided to wait in the parking lot for 35 minutes until they opened. When we got back in she informed us that they actually don't serve breakfast or have a Bloody Mary bar anymore. Needless to say we were furious that we wasted a half hour sitting next in the parking lot. Won't go back there"}
{"text":"The food here was very good. The service was a little slow but overall the experience was great. We will come back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place... all the bartenders and servers are just amazing!! Great food, live bands, other activities during the week. Every time I go there I always have a great time!! Go check them out."}
{"text":"It took a good 20 minutes after getting drinks before someone asked to take our order. Food came relatively quick after that, but no one checked on us through the meal, which I typically appreciate at a restaurant.   Entree was bland and for a chicken sandwich, there wasn't much chicken the sweet potato tots are amazing though!!    It was happy hour and check didn't reflect that with the drinks or appetizers. Didn't bother with asking, just wanted to leave.  There were only about 6 people in the place, 3 of them at the bar so, the ambient noise of sports cranked up full blast, unimpressive food and service left me with nothing much good to say about the place. Maybe on a busy night, this place might seem better because it seems like it has potential based on other reviews."}
{"text":"The worst experience ever. Tiffany was our server and she was not very responsive. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip and it was the worst ever not only that but they didn't give us enough chips in the server build them all over the table then when we asked for some more she didn't even get it started helping other tables. That was one of the worst experiences ever I can't speak on the other food because we didn't stick around to try. There are other options around the area and I suggest you eat  there before eating at this place"}
{"text":"Great grub, great service, great atmosphere, great live music, and ice cold beer!"}
{"text":"It was a very pleasant surprise to \"discover\" this gem in Chandler.  It occupies the spot where Ernie's Maryland Crab House was.  We were two couples and all had different dishes for appetizers and entrees.  All were prepared well and the staff was attentive, cheerful and helpful.  The beers were cold and the happy hour prices are standard.  We will be going back soon."}
{"text":"We went with a group of 12 with teenagers to us middle aged folk. Our server was efficient and kept us in drintks and got us our food in a timely manner. I ordered the Grilled Cheese and it was AWESOME! For a side i ordered the sweet potato tater tots and they were amazing as well.  Prices were in line with what I would expect. Later in the evening they had a live band which was good. It wasn't so loud you couldn't hear the person next to you and it made the night a little more fun.  The one thing i would sugges is a few more TV's and make the TV's larger. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Average food but I like that they have live bands which I love! I've been a few time now for the music but have had some issues with the service. The staff moves slow and doesn't seem too interested in working."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I may have had an unusually bad experience due to the fact I went there on trivia night. The employee who was announcing and commentating had a rather loud and high pitched voice, but the people participating in the game seemed to be having a good time so I won't take off any points for that. The restaurant is nice and clean with impressive decor. It's no secret that the owners have invested a pretty penny in the place, and it shows in the menu prices. It's not terribly expensive, but it might be a little expensive for the crowd that would be drawn to the restaurant. The food was good, but on some menu selections the portions can be a little smaller than expected. As far as the wait staff goes I have no major complaints except for that one employee was wearing a little too much cologne and my table was crop dusted with it every time he walked by. Not a bad place to eat but it hasn't given me a reason to go back. However, on some nights they have a live band that is actually really good, so that's a huge plus. I think this is a restaurant that some will love and some will hate."}
{"text":"Great food! Service is great. Fair prices. Family friendly. Band there on Friday nights, usually country, but a variety is played. Dance floor, happy hour, lots of TV's to view all sporting events.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We went there on Saturday night, I've been to less expensive places than this. First of all a 20oz beer cost $6.00 pricey for me. Then we looked at the menu and decided we were just going to drink our beer and that was enough. The food is really over priced, home made meatloaf $16.00, fish and chips $18.00 really!! I was thinking this was a bar, where is the bar food? They had appetizers for $8.00 you go get a bowl of chili verde and flatbread for $8.00 I'm not sure what the portion looked like. I wanted to order a large pretzel and cheese for $7.00 but they were out. The only thing that I was impressed with was the service and the booths in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I went to lunch Friday at one and I loved it. The food was amazing and I enjoyed the atmosphere and the theme of the resteraunt. I had a fantastic waitress to top it all off. The was the sweetest girl and had a huge smile on. She genuinely looked happy to be working. I didn't see any other servers working but it didn't seem to bother her. I will definitely be coming back to be served by her."}
{"text":"Not worth the prices, even during happy hour. Really nothing special here. Don't believe the other reviews. Food is decent."}
{"text":"I have been regularly. It is a good place. I have brought employees for lunch meetings and has a good lunch atmosphere. Have not been here for dinner yet. Menu is solid and I enjoy the pulled pork waayyy to much! Great food and the owner is always here."}
{"text":"Megen was a great bartender - friendly and quick service. I had the BBQ potato wedge thingies - super good! Sorry, I can't think of the name and the menu wasn't pulling up. They have tito's, my fav vodka, so I was happy! :) awesome little patio with bags to keep folks entertained. Really enjoyed the live cover band playing country, too! You could hear the songs even from outside. Definitely a fun new spot to check out in Tukee.  great prices."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new local place, but was unpleasantly surprised. From the outside the restaurant looks very nice, however the empty parking lot should have been a sign to eat somewhere else. On the inside the booth we were placed in had multiple rips in the seat. Not what I was expecting from a newly renovated restaurant in the food area of West Chandler.   Next was the menu. My wife and I ordered the grilled hotwings, better than moms meatloaf, and a burger and a couple of beers. Simple barfood right? Our tab was almost $60.00 including a standard tip. The staff was appropriately dressed and was professional.   Lets start with the appetizer. The hot wings were on the small side, even though they were advertised as being large and you only got 6 wings. The presentation was very nice, however I am in a bar and was not expecting great presentation. I was expecting value, which I did not receive paying more than $1.00/ wing.  Next the entree.... The better than moms meatloaf was $17.00!. I ordered it anyway since my mom made some incredible meatloaf and wanted to see what the offering was. GREATLY Disappointed. The meatloaf came in 2 pieces and was very small. The meat was topped with an inedible garnish, but it was everywhere so it impossible for you not to get some of it in your mouth. Mashed potatoes were good and so were the steamed vegetables. Their mom had to be a horrible cook because i would not consider it better than the fare my mom served on Thursdays.   My wife's meal was a little better, but how can you really mess up a hamburger. The fries had a funny taste to them, as if they were making funnel cake in the same oil...   Overall I left the place feeling I got ripped off. I can order a prime rib less than 1/4 mile away at Longhorn or Charlestons for the same money, or for a few dollars more I could go to Flemings or Roys. Needless to say we wont be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We come here a lot bc we live nearby. They have live music Thursday-Sunday, the food is great, servers are friendly and the owner walks around to make sure everyone is doing well.   Tonight we came and my mother in law from France ordered something to try but turns out it wasn't what she thought. The owner came over and asked if she wanted to order something else. That was very nice! We really appreciated that. :)   We love this place! You need to come here! They have great happy hr specials too!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and a great atmosphere. We come on the weekends and it seems that there is always a crowd having a good time (in a civilized middle-age kind of way).   The live music is good, but my husband and I prefer the patio on nice weekends to tone it down a bit and have a good conversation in a good environment with great food and drinks.   This place is definitely an outstanding addition to the Ahwatukee / Chandler area!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great atmosphere excellent service....: there is absolutely no reason not to go.  The food is very good, try pigs that fly and the meatloaf."}
{"text":"Good place for dinner or just drinks. Not a huge country fan so prefer the patio, not as loud. Good specials."}
{"text":"My friends and I come here on Fri or Sat night to see the great bands that play here - Ryan Sims, Desert Dixie, the Walkens, Nineball. Its always a blast. I've been here at least 10 times and I live in Scottsdale. Its worth the drive. Its a mix of various ages. (we're in our 40's) Food is really good but service is often slow, that's why they only got 4 stars."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is great and staff is super friendly. Will keep coming back. Came on Father's Day and they had a great special for the dads. The pulled pork potato skins are amazing."}
{"text":"First time here - new in town.  Saturday afternoon lunch for my wife and I.  Server was excellent, food choices good and on par with other like places.  Wait for food with only 10 other people in the place was a bit long.  Food was fair, nothing special, but overall a good place that I would come back to."}
{"text":"A coworker and I stayed at the Courtyard Marriott across the street and got a recommendation for this place from the front desk.   We walked to Nabers and after our first meal, we were hooked. We went there for dinner for the next three night of our stay. The wait staff is great and we even met the Nabers who were extremely gracious. The food was awesome; there wasn't a meal we didn't like. My personal favorite was the Asian salad with Salmon. While you're there also try the Naber's Pale Ale, brewed by a friend of the owners.   I would highly recommend this place to those traveling in the area as well as locals. How long until one opens up in Austin, TX?!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Nabers frequently, and enjoyed the atmosphere and the music! The staff is friendly and attentive. And, the food: fantastic! I've eaten several items on the menu: Caprese Bruchetta, the Charcuterie Plate, Pale Ale Battered Fried Pickles, the Jive Turkey Sliders, Triple Stack Grilled Cheese, Nabers \"Freedom\" Dip, Chicken 'N Spinach Enchilada, Grilled Sirloin', Fried Chicken, and \"Mom, the Meatloaf'. I may not order the fried chicken again, but everything else rocks!  And, when my boyfriend and I split the steak, (always cooked to perfection), they never charge for the second plate set-up! I give this place a 5 Star Rating!"}
{"text":"I'm not opposed to higher prices. In my opinion, you get what you pay for. High prices keep the riff raff away and you won't witness meatheads trying to pick fights or be obnoxiously loud here. If you are looking for a lot of cheap food, go elsewhere, there are plenty of hole in the wall sports bars in the area to serve you.  It's nice to have a more upscale sports bar in the area. The area has needed an upscale sports bar for a long time. Nabers provides great service with a very personal touch.   I would request the following from the owners if they really want to make this a special place.   -Be loyal to the local teams. Show ASU, U of A, Cardinals, Coyotes, D-Backs and Suns games. You would be surprised how you can walk into a sports bar and not find the local game on. To make matters worse, the staff will be rude to you if you ask them to put the local game on. Don't be the typical Arizona bar that leaves the channel on ESPN 2 displaying World Poker Tour instead of the D-backs game or the Coyotes game.   - Provide fast and reliable Wi-Fi. A lot of fantasy football watchers require it.   -Offer valet service on NFL Sundays during football season. Parking can be a pain during this time and the option to drop off your car and walk in is a nice luxury  - Offer a VIP room on football afternoons and special sporting events for die hard fans who are willing to pay more for more personal and accessible service.   -Consider offering an online reservation ability where you can reserve, schedule and select your table during football Sundays when it is really busy for an additional fee of course.   - Secure the parking lot or have a parking lot attendant. A lot of fights, hazing and vandalism occur at night. People are less likely to do this if the parking lot is supervised.  -Know your customers on a personal level and remember their names. Call them by their respective titles unless they tell you otherwise"}
{"text":"Love this place! We go every other weekend. The live bands are awesome! Great atmosphere.   I've had ups and downs with the menu. The bread pudding is the best!   The drinks are always perfect. We're always greeted by name and with a smile.   I highly recommend Nabers!"}
{"text":"Great \"Naber\"hood bar. Had the cheese curds and sliders, both amazing. The rotating taps are awesome.  I tried the Huss Scottsdale Blonde and my friend had SanTan Epicenter. The place is clean, good music, and the bartender Jamie was fun and attentive. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We visited Nabers on Saturday night.  Not a big crowd, we sat at one table for about 10 minutes never got served and then went to another table hoping to get served there. After another 10 minutes my husband went to the bar to get a drink there.  As we sat there more table did come in.  The waitresses focused on 8 tables and finally right before we left at about 11:15 they helped the table next to us.  Never once were 5 tables asked if they wanted a drink.  Those of us in these tables kind of joked about it every time we had to go to the bar for a drink.  We have been to Nabers about 8 times, this was by far the worst.  Believe me the waitresses were not overworked and it seemed like they spent a lot of time in the kitchen out of sight.  Not a good visit and probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I have not had a decent triple deck Grilled Cheese sandwich since Angels closed on Country Club and the 60 in 1998! This was the BEST adult grilled cheese I have ever had! Praise the Lord FINALLY!! I went for lunch at 11 am so I was the only one in the place but it didn't matter the atmosphere was wonderful and the service was amazing. I find sometimes when restaurants are not busy it takes forever to get my food but this WAS NOT the case. I didn't even have a chance to check my emails before my food was served. I had the chance to talk with the manager and had a great conversation about what to expect when I come back which I plan on doing for sure! It is quite the drive for me but well worth it. This place has plenty of room to listen to the live music or have a conversation. I am looking forward to coming back. Great place for lunch too so check them out!"}
{"text":"Nabers recently hosted a memorial celebration for a large group gathering.  They were fantastic to work with, very accommodating, suggested a budget friendly and tasty spread.  I can't say enough about the great service, friendly staff and good food. Their motto, \"where friends gather\" couldn't be more appropriate. I will definitely be visiting this locally owned establishment more often.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Food still great. Entertainment \" Top Notch\" service great. The food here is definitely not typical bar food. Selection and taste is great. Have had a number of the menu items and each was well prepared, well plated and tasty. The staff is friendly and attentive to customer requests and service. This is one of the only venues in the area with music 5 nights a week. The have their own special Nabers Ale and a Bloody Mary with a bacon garnish. Plenty of parking and a fun clientele. Worth the stop."}
{"text":"This is unfortunate.  Came to town to visit family and was looking forward to trying this place since none of us had been here before. The good news: the food was good...though the menu is limited.  And the waitstaff was helpful. The bad news: as we finished dinner a giant waterbug joined us at our table. Not ok. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Walked into an empty place and we stood at the 'wait to be seated' sign for a good four minutes before asking the nice guy at the bar if it's self seating. A girl came out from behind a wall and seated us. She was also our server. Apparently the only one and ill equipped to give even basic customer service. I watched 4 other groups wait awkwardly at the front before being greeted.  Cheese curds are great. The table also had: -meatloaf sliders: good but only need one. They're really rich.  -Pulled Pork sandwich: pork was good, on the dry side though.  -shrimp po boy: dry, nothing held it together, had to eat with a knife and fork.  -French fries: standard  Not good enough to return...first impressions matter."}
{"text":"My husband and I needed a place to eat lunch before heading to Sam's Club. Good choice as the food was good.  My husband had the Bohi-burger which was AMAZING, fries are so tasty and the corned-beef hash soup was great. I also had the tuna wrap which was mushy, dry and had little flavor. Bummer. It was dead and we waited forever to get drink refills and the check. Server (Katie) was sweet though. We'll come back for live music."}
{"text":"Time to try that \"new\" place just over the hill from Ahwatukee...don't be afraid of Nabers, neighbors, its across from Sam's Club and we KNOW you go there!!  It's a fun menu and we decided to risk it on the Cheese Curds.  Light, fluffy and served super hot with a very nice peppy southwest ranch style dip. Score!  We both got burgers and they were 3-thumbs up!  Meat was juicy and flavorful but not greasy. The set-up was fresh and there were enough fries to be enjoyable, not menacing.  Deep Fried pickle spear on top is a whimsical touch but eat it FIRST while still hot for maximum enjoyment.  Would return YES. Would try other items YES.   Good Job supporting LOCAL BREWERIES - we saw Four Peaks and San Tan on Tap along with a nice selection of interesting craft beers. SUPPORT this locally owned establishment and keep NABERS in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a whim Saturday night. While the menu didn't instantly impress us, we decided while we're here we might as well give it a shot.  I am soooo glad we did. WOW, the service and food were phenomenal. They brought out house chips with a chipotle sauce that were spot on.  I ordered the chicken sandwich and my boyfriend ordered the cheeseburger. Everything was better than we expected.  We finished it off with an Apricot Cheesecake that came with Vanilla Bean ice cream. Again...WOW.   We left stuffed and excited to go back again!!   As for the other reviews, to complain the U.S. Flag is displayed everywhere seems very Un-American to me. I'm a die-hard liberal and I didn't find anything offensive or that would point to the owners being right wing. Yeah they like country music and are proud of their country's flag. That doesn't make them conservative, it makes them Americans!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile and I'm so glad I finally came in. The food is delicious, the atmosphere is great and the service is wonderful! Joey at the bar took great care of me!! I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We visited Nabers early in the year and we liked the place and the food very much They have an original menu. Jannelle took good care of us but I did not find them very friendly for low carb.  I had ordered a hamburger with lettuce leaves instead of bun, they just got me the hamburger without bun, no lettuce. I had also ordered an appetizer with the sauce on the side. They forgot that important part (the sauce was sweet)... oh well. What I could eat was very good though..."}
{"text":"This is based off our first time coming here. Our waitress Janelle was not a good server at all. My husband and I both served tables for years so we are good judges of this task, and she was bad. She wasn't friendly or attentive and she wasn't busy either as we came into a nearly empty restaurant.  We ordered cheese curds as an app, and it came with jalapeno ranch dressing, we asked for regular ranch and our server said, \"we dont have regular ranch.\" Ummmm whaaaa?! Funny because my sons chicken fingers came ranch and it didn't taste like our jalapeno ranch. Either she was being super lazy or this restaurant made a dumb move not carrying the most popular dressing on earth.  Our food was good, but not good enough to come back and spend what they charge. My sons chicken fingers were not tasty at all, he was very disappointed. My Shrimp Po Boy was good, but not enough to order again. My husband and a delicious burger but it was so rich he said he would never order it again. The best part of the meal was the sweet potato tots... so yummy!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed in our dining experience here. First, we ended up sitting in an area where the only other \"patrons\" was a waitress (I'm assuming she was off at the time? I don't know she kept getting up and wandering) and her boyfriend who we're making out most of the time. I guess management finds this behavior of their staff acceptable. Second, our food was not good at all. We'd been wanting to try Naber's for quite some time and the reviews seemed promising. I got the \"brat sliders\" which were very thin and dry burger patties with some spicy aioli sloppily thrown on them. The buns were way too big for such tiny servings of meat. My husband ordered another slider meal and he was unhappy with them as well, it was just awful. Our waitress was friendly enough, no complaints there. I don't think we'll give this place another try, such a disappointment with so many other (better) options in the same area."}
{"text":"I am not reviewing their food or drinks because I came out there Thursday to see if dancing would be a possibility.  The place is very dance unfriendly, despite the fact that they advertise dancing on their front sign.  Their layout is totally wrong to foster a dance culture. To make matters worse the floor is an awful painted cement that is dirty and sticky. Ick!  And the live country music, although good, wasn't dance music. Dudes, get a drummer and bass player.  I got there about 8:15 and it was very dead. A few couples sitting at tables but no hint of anyone that could dance. Of course that figures, because anyone that knows how to dance wouldn't come there. Duh!   Why would somebody invest so much money to open a place that is guaranteed to lose on what it claims to be - music and dance?"}
{"text":"Very average food.  Happy Hour is only 3 dollars off 11 dollar appetizers.  The food really is very average."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place. I love that they play country music and their food is really delicious. I had never had a fried pickle before and it was solo good. I also got a Hawaiian flat bread that they were doing on special, which was yummy but only after picking out the habaneros (so spicy!!!).  Truly, props to the chef who clearly takes great pride in his work. I'd definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great service, great food & good selections of beers.  This was the first time I have been Naber's & I was very impressed.   If you like sports bars with occasional live music, this is a good spot."}
{"text":"Thanks Ronin for your detailed description about Nabers (& yourself as well!).  Based on your review, I headed right over to check it out. Very very nice, friendly staff greeted me and served me as if I were their family or friend. I loved the food, the drinks and the warm friendly attitude. I was unable to appreciate the offensiveness of all that pro-USA vibe you seemed to encounter, but I assume that's probably more of a review of yourself than the place. I'm definitely coming back and bringing family and friends. Thanks Ronin!"}
{"text":"Great location, very clean facility, Amazing food and exceptional service... what else can I say?! The entire staff are professional and friendly. Great place for lunch, happy hour and lots of live music in the evenings. After meeting Denise (the GM) its no surprise that the place runs like a top. Denise is \"top notch\" very professional and enthusiastic. I plan on coming back often."}
{"text":"Very very cool places! Prices were decent and anywhere I can find cheese curds on the menu is ok in my book! The Friday fish fry was great (can you tell my fiancé and I are from the Midwest?) and the burger was pretty good as well. Service was great and restaurant was very clean! We like country music so we also thought it was cool that it was a country themed bar. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped in early June for her birthday we did not eat any food but we grabbed a drink or two and listened to the live band. We had a blast, people working there were great, very easy going crowd. We were told It was a little slow for a weekend night but we didn't mind one bit. They had a ping pong table which we both played a few games before they had to pack it up to make room for dancing and the band. The band that night was a great county band Young Country, I believe was the name. Drinks just a little on the pricey side but still good. They should roll out a few more drink specials. Definitely gonna head back there soon for some more dancing and live music."}
{"text":"I couldn't give this place more than one star even though I wanted to. In fact, I don't write many reviews and I had to take a moment to write this. I'm still feeling sick from my nasty burger. I think the cook may have lost the lid off salt shaker-- each bite was like licking a block of salt and trust me, I like things salty. The service was some of the worst I've ever experienced. Our group of eight arrived together and we were seated right away. 2 people in our group got their food right away and the rest of us waited 45 minutes and we only ordered burgers.   My burger was disgusting! I ordered the one with the bacon, over easy egg and onion strings. The egg was like a rubber disk and the yolk was hard! It was way too salty for even me to eat. We didn't complain and still they realized how they screwed us over. Four of us didn't even take more than 2 -3 bites because it was so gross (and we're not snobs). They only offered us one free dessert for the whole table!   They should have had the manager come to apologize and comped the meals that took forever and given us all dessert, at least that's what I would've done. I haven't even begun to tell you the entire story. Go ahead and give it a try and come back on yelp and write a review that say's \"I should have listened to some of those negative reviews.\""}
{"text":"Great local beers, live music and awesome food!! On a cold night my husband and I came here and split the pasta fusilli with chicken and the grilled cheese with roasted turkey. Both were a huge hit for us. Mark said he is going to crave the pasta!"}
{"text":"This is a Great Neighborhood Hangout. Came here multiple times for business functions and the service has always been top notch. Customer service is Great and the menu selection is GOOD. I came in on a friday for lunch with my wife and kids and they loved the place, truly a neighborhood hangout whether you are with friends for a good beer, burger and music, co-workers, a function or with your family.  Thanks Naber's for always going the extra mile with Great Customer Service.                                                                                                   - Anthony with Mava Consulting"}
{"text":"This place is worth checking out even if you have to drive! The bartenders are smoooooookin and the food is even better! I would suggest the Arizona rolls and the meatloaf sliders absolutely to die for. Not mention the atmosphere whether with music playing live or watching a sporting event you cant go wrong."}
{"text":"This place is awesome they are a country bar in a way with amazing live music 4 night per week and they have great food and ice cold beer and the staff and bartenders are awesome"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday. Had been here before when it was called something else. They've got a pretty good \"local craft beer\" selection. We also had lunch. I ordered the \"BMF Burger\" and fries. The burger was seasoned perfectly as well as \"Flame broiled\" and cooked to perfection. My wife had the \"Pulled pork sandwich\" and said that it was \"excellent\" and would order it again.  Bartender was very friendly and attentive. Looks like the place is more of a \"Night-life\" place as they have LIVE music at nights.  They have a few tv's in the main bar area as well. I would definitely return to Naber's bar."}
{"text":"Um, no.  The service is ok but the food is not 4 stars. Happy hour isn't anything to write home to mom about. Only $3 off food that is priced pretty high.   It's just ok."}
{"text":"Good Food and Great Service!  Just a bit pricey for the type of food they serve is my only complaint."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and I must say I like this place!   Staff: A+ (Very Friendly and prompt)   Vibe: B+ (Like a Toby Keith's JR.)  Entertainment: A+ (Awesome live music)  Bar :A ( Its got everything except Norm)  Prices: Average  Food: B ( Pass on the steak) go for the burgers and fries.  Overall I give this place a SOLID A!  Check this place out your gonna love the people and the atmosphere. We will be back for sure!       burgers."}
{"text":"Their food is alright, but it's a good atmosphere and they have great happy hour deals. They often have live music which is always fun!"}
{"text":"I just got my fries cheese curds and audibly said \"Holy Shit\".  Been driving by this place for sometime and decided to give it a try. At first glance no more than a typical sports bar but inside very roomy and clean. You would probably drive right by not being impressed at first glance. The decor and ambience inside is very warm and inviting. Menu is very much like a sports bar but have an excellent variety of spirits and wine as well as unique options on the menu. I could tell right away with the promptness of our service and the size of our first appetizer, fried cheese curds, this was going to be a great experience.   Fried cheese curds were awesome and plentiful. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and Jen ordered the chopped salad with steak. Bother were huge. To go box for the salad. I heard there was starving people in Africa so I felt bad about leaving leftovers so I made sure to clean my plate. Besides, nobody likes a quitter.   The whole experience was great. Service was impeccable. Food was delicious. They also have live bands and big tables for groups. We will be back. Can't believe we waited this long."}
{"text":"I just tried the turkey wrap & fries and it was one of the best wraps I ever had. Fries were steaming hot, too."}
{"text":"Glad to have an alternative bar from the 'sand box' close to home. Love that they play country music and even have a live band. The staff is friendly and helpful. Although, I wasn't impressed with the food. I had the jalapeño poppers & pretzel. The jalapeño was not cooked and still raw tasting. The pretzel was bland and a bit over priced. Overall, I'd recommend the place but just eat beforehand."}
{"text":"Nabers is my new garage! It has great beer, a few local rotating taps, and great food. The grilled cheese is the best I have ever tried! I don't even mind the fact that they play country music because everything else is so perfect. I can't wait till they get a trivia night going there."}
{"text":"This place is country. And I had no idea.  Our waiter was great. Very good customer service. And they know how to serve a Guinness.. Snaps some places fail!  Nachos were more like bag of random chips slaughtered in toppings. Not what I was expecting and I am nto a nacho fan (the rest of the table wanted this) so No docked points from thsi because I am biased Anti Nacho.  The Bruschetta was great. :D Really hit the spot. I was so happy!"}
{"text":"Service and food were pretty good. Atmosphere was fun. They don't want to change food around. Hubby wanted beef instead of turkey burger and they wouldn't change."}
{"text":"This place is great! Friendly attentive staff, great food, great music. They start by bringing out homemade potato chips with chipotle aioli dipping sauce; I don't usually like potato chips but these were fantastic. Light and not greasy, perfectly salted and still tasted like potatoes.  The menu isn't huge, but I prefer that-- it's not overwhelming and everything cooked well. I got the shrimp po'boy and my friend got the not your momma's meatloaf. They were both excellent, but if you want something different I'd go with the meatloaf. It was wrapped in bacon and stuffed with veal. Someone on yelp complained that it's \"expensive bar food,\" I'd call it inexpensive quality food. It's a spin on bar food, but if you want oversized, gluttonous portions and greasy 50 cent wings with boring flavors, stick to a lamp-heated trough. I  mean buffet. We also had the fries, sweet potato fries, steamed vegetables and mashed potatoes. All were tasty. We stayed after dinner to watch the band; the whole experience was great."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, and maybe it's just growing pains, but you'd figure after they've been open a couple months they'd have worked themselves out.  Let's start with the good:  The staff was super friendly.  The fries are world class.  Don't know why, but they are.  The Nabers IPA on tap is a really good, refreshing, unoffensive example of the style.   If they sold it in stores I'd seek it out.  The mega pretzel appetizer was tasty and had just the right texture....but $7 is steep.    Which leads me into the not-so-good.   The menu sounds great in theory, but the prices are on the high side, and the dishes we had just weren't all that good.     My son's chicken strips were tough, and Naber's either needs to change the oil they're cooked in, or change brands/type of oil altogether.  Whatever it was left an \"off\" taste in them.     My wife's French Dip looked pretty good, the roll was decent enough, but the beef was tough and kind of tinny tasting.  Definitely \"meh\".    I had the corn chowder and the Nuclear Shrimp appetizer together as my meal.   The chowder seems homemade, but it was unfortunately very bland.  A little blast of salt perked it right up though.   The Nuclear Shrimp were spicy indeed, but had also quite obviously been sitting at the kitchen window for a loooooong time.  Seems like the kitchen prepared them as an app and put them up but then they sat while the server waited to deliver them as a main course (as requested).  Better communication between the two would keep that from happening.    And, we didn't get any place settings until after our meal was delivered.  That always irks me.      The manager comped me one of my beers for my crappy shrimp plate without any prompting at all.  It's obvious they have customer satisfaction top of mind, but it would be better if they build that satisfaction with better execution in the first place.  We'll probably give it another shot some time but we're not going to rush back."}
{"text":"The service was really good and the prices were great for the quality food that they serve. My only issue is the country music playing. I wish I could give 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Country atmosphere, lots of flat screen tv's all around for patrons to view their favorite venue. A little on the pricey side for lunch, but worth it. We elected to order off the menu instead of taking advantage of their $6 lunch specials. They serve large entree portions, huge Mason Jar beverages and the service was excellent. Had a Group On, $24 for $40 worth of food. Didn't realize it was for 4 people to eat & we had 3. Manager was nice & honored our Group On, we payed the balance after the $40 discount was subtracted. We left with smiles on our face & full belly's. Thank you Nabers for your generosity."}
{"text":"I came here for happy hour with my ladies the other day.. We had a pretty big group so we sat on the patio.   We ordered the AZ rolls and the hummus plate. The hummus plate was good and really huge! I wasn't too fond of the az rolls. I think it was because it was mixed with a couple different cheeses maybe? For drinks I just got the merlot. I should've gotten a beer. They have 20 ounce beers for $4! They have a very huge selection of happy hour items that last until 7.   The thing that got me was they don't have ranch! How does a restaurant serve wings and salads and such and not have ranch! I'm a ranch girl, so I need my ranch with my wings, salads or fries. My meal came with a jalapeño ranch. Um how did they make that if they don't have ranch? Because of this, they get a three star from me."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here all the time. Sometimes just for a might and sometimes with the kids. Super friendly staff and a great environment.  Live music on the weekends and the food, we'll that why we all come to yelp. The food has always been awesome! I'm a total foodie and the food here has always been delicious.  The BBQ sandwich with potato salad and fried onion strings on top is great. Everything from fried pickles to bread pudding is fantastic. I only wish more people knew about this great \"naberhood\" place. You won't be disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"We went to this place when it was mostly empty, so I was concerned. But the beer selection was pretty good, local craft and other interesting and solid choices. 15 in all. The waitress got a kick out of the appetizer that involved balls, but it was really just mashed potatoes in fried balls. Nothing to get excited about.  They have this giant bacon burger with bacon in and on top of the burger patty. It has a fried egg on it as well. It was the bomb. It was huge, like a child's head.  Staff seems pretty fun, a little weird but that's OK. I'm weird too. The prices were a little high, with three of us spending close to $90 on three meals, one appetizer, and a few drinks. To be fair though, we went with entrées and not the lunch specials. Those were six dollars I think."}
{"text":"My husband and I just enjoyed a pleasant, relaxing meal out on the patio at Nabers. Our bartender/server, Philip, was awesome! He was personable and attentive. We enjoyed our $4 beers (the Oak Creek Nut Brown Ale was fantastic!) and our happy hour appetizers. We split the caprese bruschetta and the sliders combo. I enjoyed the unique slider choices, especially the brat/jalapeño/cheese and the pulled pork with gold BBQ sauce and potato salad on a bun. Good pub grub, but nothing to shout about, so we'll give it 4 stars. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Visited recently after they opened. Although they still have some kinks to work out I think it will be a great neighborhood bar. Service was very good and Denise the manager came over to ask how things were going. The bar area looked impressive and bathrooms were clean which is a big change from the former owners. I'll revisit in another month to see how things are going!"}
