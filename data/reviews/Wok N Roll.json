{"text":"WAY better than Chen's on Bella Vista! Great FRESH food, and they don't forget names and faces. VERY personable staff."}
{"text":"coming from San Francisco aka \"little asia\" i'm still on the hunt for great asian dining. this isn't it, especially for the price!! Maybe they have it so dark in there so you can't really see how skimpy the rolls are.   dont get me wrong, the food is good. but not great, and overpriced for quality.  oh and i went in there a second time for a boba (tapioca drink) i wanted mango slush but they where out after i paid, so i said a thai tea w/boba. and she said she might be out too, if so i told her i guess i'll take a peach slush. she went to the back and i saw a server come out and asked if there was thai tea left and she said yes. but the owner comes back and says they didn't and handed me a peach slush more than half way melted.   maybe cause the thai tea was $2 less and she didn't want to refund me my money.   SHADY!  Sucks cause i work at the new salon  next door so we would have given them great business."}
{"text":"Was really impressed with this place. Sushi was decent, chinese fair was good and the have a couple of my favorite dim sum items."}
{"text":"Totally agree with Sandi. We were so excited to try it and nothing was good except the Cal rolls.   The meat dish was horrendous and my daughter realized we could have gone to Chandler and ate at Pacific... which is much better, has awesome sushi and all you can eat options.   I think the only reason places around here do well at all is because people do not want to drive an hour for a decent meal."}
{"text":"We heard from someone that the W & R was pretty good, so we decided to stop by and do dinner. We were impressed with our experience. Its a smaller place, but has a classy sushi bar feel to it (smooth jazz playing, dim lighting, clean, nice decor, etc.). Service was great. There were only a few other tables occupied but we went in at 5.  We noticed they had a ton of deliveries going out. We ordered a spicy tuna roll, kung pao chicken w/ rice, and the shrimp tempura roll. The kung pao was decent, I've had better and worse elsewhere. The sushi rolls were just as good as I've had in many other sushi places throughout the valley. For one thing, I've never seen so much tuna in a spicy tuna roll before! The pieces were packed! We couldn't believe how much fish was in each piece...these made other sushi place's rolls seem bite-size. Everything was reasonably priced as well, and not too much. All in all, we enjoyed! I recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"Ohh my lordy. No good! My boyfriend and I just moved from Portland and were looking for a good sushi place. Steer clear of this place. (I'm still sick to my stomach)   I ordered the Fried Calamari and Chicken Fried Rice Calamari was over cooked chewy but was not fried crispy. It was almost tasting like it was frozen then baked. Ehh not good. The fried rice had NO flavor.   B/f ordered a Smoked Salmon and Avocado roll. You could take this both ways, there was a ton of salmon in it. But it was not smoked very raw and too much for our liking.   Service was fast, we were the only ones there (and now I don't wonder why) Decor was very romantic and DARK. Too dark for my preferences, I couldn't tell what color my food was."}
{"text":"We are so sad to see that this place has closed.  We miss our Friday night routine of chicken yakisoba, orange chicken and a large Saki Bomber... Please re open somewhere else!! Or Better yet back near us!!!"}
{"text":"We ate here the night the restaurant opened.  We ordered the kung pow chicken, orange chicken, and two sushi rolls.  The kung pow chicken (what I ordered) was very delicious and spicy (the way it's supposed to be).  The orange chicken was different than what I had previously had (panda express) but the difference was very good.  It didn't have the sticky, syrupy taste that one comes to associate with orange chicken.  My wife and son both had the sushi and thought it was very good.  I will take her word for it as she grew up eating sushi and sashimi in Hawaii and should know what it should tastes like.  Overall, the food was very good and a pleasant change from fast food Asian fare.  I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I love this place, the singapore noodles are excellant as well as what i know as the bird nest. Been here several times and never had a bad meal. I'm very surprised by the  reviews."}
{"text":"I don't know what the complaint is. Its as good as it get. Stop by when I was driving through the city. Staff is great and helpful!"}
{"text":"The owners are really nice and kid friendly but the food is bland and the portions are smaller than most other places."}
{"text":"We don't even ask for menus any longer.  We just sit at the sushi bar and have Irene choose our meal, appetizer to dessert.... Perfect every time!!!  We go once a week!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, but the portions were smaller than most places.  Probably won't order again.  Free delivery is irrelevant when everything is overpriced."}
{"text":"Never disappointed with this place. The sushi rolls are very good. The staff is always nice and very helpful."}
{"text":"Where to start with this place? My family was so excited to try this place we went just a few days after they opened. The quality of the food here is not worth the price, your wallet and your pallet will take a beating. Their delivery service is a joke, half the time when we call for delivery there are no drivers available. My family has nixed ever eating at this establishment again-the food, price and poor service will send you running."}
{"text":"So sad Wok n Roll is closed!  My Husband and I ate there at least once a month, sometimes as often as each week!  Best sushi/Chinese/Japanese food in the valley!  We always felt at home, welcomed, and stuffed with yummy food each time we were there.  Glad the family can now enjoy more quality time together, but miss my Mongolian Beef soup, Crab puffs, and Honey Walnut Shrimp!!!  Maybe sometime in the future, there will be a new location to tempt my pallet. :-)     And, Thanks for the happy memories!"}
{"text":"Finally, a Sushi restaurant, way out here in the middle of no where! Located in a mostly deserted shopping center in San Tan Valley. I am not sure, but I think this is the opening week for this new Japaneses/Chinese restaurant . We ordered the Ginger & Scallion chicken along with the Beef Chow Fun. The chicken dish came out room temperature and the chow fun did not have a lot of flavor, but a little soy sauce improved it somewhat. For $3 more per person our dinners came with Miso soup, Salad, Egg rolls and Gyozas. The food was not the best I have ever tasted but it was ok and met my expectations.  With all the restaurants that go out of business in this economy, you have to be on your game.  In time, I hope Wok n Roll finds it's place.  We need great restaurants out here, in the middle of no where, not just ok restaurants."}
{"text":"Wow!  I certainly didn't expect this little gem hidden back in a strip mall near Copper Basin.  We went for the first time some months after it opened and had time to improve on initial efforts.  The restaurant serves both Japanese and Chinese dishes. It's owned by a family who had restaurants in the Los Angeles area.   The food was delicious and portions were not skimpy.  For under $8, we each had a lunch that included teriyaki chicken (or tempura or shrimp and other choices), four pieces of sushi, two crab and cheese wontons, two \"dumplings\", rice, cucumber salad, and soup.   (FYI, sushi is any type of chopped food placed inside a rice wrap and cut into round slices.  Sashimi is raw fish.  So, some sushi can be cooked or just have vegetables.  I mention this because many people avoid sushi altogether as they think it's all about raw fish.)  The place was decorated tastefully.  The popularity of Wok n Roll has grown to where, on some weekend nights, there's a wait for a table."}
{"text":"What a great place sushi. Hard to find good sushi near Florence and this place is awesome. It's also very rare to find dim sum around here and it was so good. Just overall GREAT food and super service."}
{"text":"When we drove up to Wok N Roll, we thought they were closed. It's not lit up very much. We realized it was open, because customers were leaving, so we went inside. The inside was just as dark! It was like a romantic dinner attempt gone wrong, because we could barely see our food!  Our server was great, but we couldn't really tell if she was smiling... because it was SO DARK.  Great food, but over priced. Flavors were amazing! Also, portions were smaller than most places that are similar. If we go back, it will be during the day so hopefully they'll have some lights on!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Wok N Roll last week for a late dinner with my wife. The food was very good...we are both fanatical about the Soft Shell Crab Rolls - definitely give these a try when you pay these guys a visit.  The orange beef and orange chicken were also very good. Nice atmosphere/decor - glad to see a place like this in our neck of the woods. The staff was very friendly and the service was good. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I got a flyer for wok n roll and decided to give it a try.  Ive seen the place before and outside doesn't look too inviting with the windows all covered up.  But once i got inside it was a small and quaint place.  we were the only ones in the place and got our drinks, appetizer, and food very quickly.   The food was great and the price was comparable to a panda express or something similar.  I'm already planning on going back and have recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"We had a great time here! Walked in and was able to sit and wait for the rest of our party to show up. Our waitress was very friendly and informative on tastes and what's popular. My fianc√© and I shared the chicken yakisobi, crab puffs and beef and broccoli. We had a large party and our food was quick to be served. This was our first time and will not be our last."}
