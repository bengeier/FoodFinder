{"text":"Gem on the danforth.  Don't let the small, homely and more basic esthetics of the restaurant fool you.  Cocktails are inventive.  Service is prompt.  Food is delicious.

Modern South Indian (Keralan) fare with very fresh ingredients.  I believe they try to use local/regional ingredients.  Spices are relatively mild in some dishes, but flavours have depth.  Our favourites included mulligatawny soup, crab entree, and desserts (not too sweet).  Interesting amuse bouches.  Looking forward to going back and trying the lamb (it was ordered on almost every other table, and sold out).

Bonus points for being family run.  Reservations recommended (saw people turned away).  $$-$$$."}
{"text":"Wonderful flavours, unique dishes and helpful service will  keep us coming back.  Our favourite dish is the mushroom curry.  The appetizers (dosas, pakoras) are also fresh and flavourful.  We have been at least 5 times since they opened, and have never been disappointed.  Aravind's south Indian fare is a welcome addition to the Danforth strip. It  has also replaced traditional curry-house style Indian in our rotation for good!  I  have a gluten intolerance which can make dining out a challenge. Aravind's staff was extremely helpful in guiding me through the menu, most of which is compatible with a gluten-free diet.   I look forward to trying their new lamb & chicken entrees soon."}
{"text":"This place is a must try!

Great atmosphere. Friendly Service. Food is simply amazing.

This is NOT your typical Toronto Indian fare. This is Indian fine dining. The food is light and airy with aromatics that will knock you off your feet.

The Dungeness Crab Biryani is perfectly balanced and just lovely.

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We just enjoyed a five-star meal at this lovely restaurant, served on the garden patio. The menu is well-planned; the dishes are creatively, skillfully and beautifully prepared, complete with delightful amuse bouches. The host is extremely knowledgable and charming. The prices are extremely reasonable for this high calibre cuisine. This is the best East Indian food I have ever had in Toronto. A wonderful discovery!"}
{"text":"I've been to Aravind a couple times since it opened earlier this year, and I can't stop recommending it to people. Like previous reviews have pointed out, this place isn't typical of most Indian places in Toronto. Don't come expecting butter chicken. In fact, don't come expecting chicken at all, because Aravind's menu consists of fish, seafood and vegetarian items.

It's southern Indian and Keralan fare. I don't know enough about cuisine on the Indian sub-continent to know exactly what that means, but from what I've understood and seen, that means no meat (save for fish) and no heavy sauces. Aravind also doesn't do the 'share' portions typical of most curry-focused Indian places in the city. Their dishes are individually plated and everything is made to order (or at least they have a knack for making it taste like it is). And they make a point of sourcing as much as possible (fish, produce, etc) from right here in Ontario.

Inventive Indian-inspired cocktails, too, which isn't totally surprising considering owner Aravind Kozhikott apparently used to man the bar at Thuet.

Chris Nuttall-Smith of Toronto Life called the crab biryani at Aravind one of Toronto's best dishes of 2011. I've had it, twice, and I think he's bang on with that assessment.

Go. Here. Now."}
{"text":"Brilliant fresh Indian food. One of the best on the Danforth. Beautiful patio out back. Easy to miss from the front but a place you MUST visit."}
{"text":"The owners are true Keralites from Kerala, the southern-most province of India. South Indian food is typically very hot (spicy), but the food here is very tasty without being hot! Too often hot spices are relied upon to give taste to Indian food, but not so here, which IMO exemplifies the proficiency of the chefs. The son describes each dish with great enthusiasm and knowledge, which just adds to the dining experience. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but not fantastic.

Here is what we had:
- Different styles of dosa: while yummy, it is no where near the spice that this dish deserves (2/5)
- Over Easy Eggs in a skillet: Really unique pairing of over easy eggs with curried mushrooms and  chickpeas. This dish gets mega points for creativity! (5/5)

This restaurant is catered towards people who are looking for a first time experience with south Indian cuisine. You can get more taste for your $ else where."}
{"text":"Food is alright. Good value for what you pay, but not phenomenal. Back patio is nicer than the dining room"}
{"text":"Great dinner last night.  Small menu with VQA wines.  A bit pricey for South Indian ($14 Dosa) ...  but it is worth it."}
{"text":"Very tasty south Indian flavours with a twist - not the usual dreck that is produced by 95% of Indian restaurants in this city. Everything is carefully prepared and emphasises local ingredients. Ambience in the restaurant is lacking but the wine list with reasonable markups makes up for it!"}
