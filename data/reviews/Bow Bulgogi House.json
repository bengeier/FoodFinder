{"text":"Everything you get is amazing, I personally believe this is the best Korean Barbeque in Calgary. The owners are friendly and are happy to serve you. My favourite thing to get is the short ribs I recommend getting them because they explode with flavour and tenderness in your mouth. I can Promise you will not be disappointed by coming here."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little place for Korean food.  Get there early, because I hear the lineups can get long. Their Korean BBQ is very tasty... and as mentioned, the Tofu Buchim is where it's at."}
{"text":"This small korean restaurant serves pretty good, not great, korean barbecue; bulgogi and galbi. Side dishes are nice, and, among them, tofu is the best. This tofu with seasoned soy sause is maybe the best one you can get in Canada, at least. They serve the best bulgogi and galbi(rib) in Calgary, but they are bit sweeter and saltier than authentic ones you can get in Korea. They are quite busy during dinner hours, so reservation is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Just okay Korean food and right on the budget. Tried the pork bone soup, okay but not as good compared to In Cheon House Korean & Japanese Restaurant or Owl of Minerva. If you are looking for a quick Korean fix, then this is for you. FYI. They have lunch specials."}
{"text":"I dont frequent this part of town, so it was nice to \"expand\" into newer territory to find yet another amazing restaurant. Its non descript as others have mentioned, due to its location in a strip mall, so make sure not to pass it by!!  The friends we went with, who reccomended Beef Bulgogi, forewarned it may be busy. Sure enough, we walk in and it was packed, always a good sign, but we managed to get a table within minutes. The food was delicious, and came quickly. The service friendly and efficient. Efficient to the next level, because instead of having those of us who are not good with chopsticks struggle with tearing the meat apart, they provide SCISSORS!! How genius is that??!  The server gave us a little demo, and precisely cut away at the meat to make delicate strips, and showed us how to put it together with the other parts of the meal.  I cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Really amazing Korean barbecue. Tiny place but great service and a truely wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"I am a Korean, and this place does not have authentic Korean food. The food, especially the BBQ, tastes like they added tonnes of MSG, butter, and salt.   And I have personally never seen a Korean restaurant that charges extra for side dish re-fill.   I mean if it suits your tastebud, that's great. But there are more authentic places than this."}
{"text":"Yukgaejang had way too much black pepper. The side dishes are quite lacking and the owner asked me how the meal was and when I said maybe there was too much black pepper in the soup, she just gave a look and didn't respond."}
{"text":"After circling the parking lot and googling \"Alberta fire hydrant parking regulations\", I parked on 35th street. The other reviews warned me but I still wasn't prepared for how small and ordinary the restaurant itself looked. I actually double-check the address to make sure I was in the right place; I was.  Done with the parking shenanigans, I settled down and ordered a beef bulgogi. The beef came in a sizzling cast iron platter with 5 side dishes/condiments and a basket of lettuce. It was mind-blowingly good. I left this little restaurant a happy camper.   That was my first experience with Bow Bulgogi. Since then, I've returned several times and never been disappointed (also never changed my order. It's always the pork or beef bulgogi).   In the Calgarian world of bland, cute-on-the-tongue food, Bow Bulgogi stands out for consistently serving tasty and well-spiced food."}
{"text":"Great Korean food at reasonable prices. As expected, the bulgoki is very good but the appetizers are just as good. While other Korean restaurants offer the same type of appetizers, I never asked them for refills like I did at Bow Bulgoki.  Only downside to some would be the basic diner like atmosphere. Perhaps not a place to bring a first date. :)"}
{"text":"Figured I'll try the pho here and it was a big mistake: really bland /w tough cuts of beef. Their Korean dishes are a lot better but nothing spectacular. Decor is old and worn out, feels like eating at a food court, prices are above average. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"Best of the best korean food!! Tofu is amazing. LA ribs so juicy and flavorful. Pork simply amazing if you like a bit of spice. Every dish will make your mouth water. Been going here for over 16 years now! No other korean bbq can beat it in the city. Service has always been wonderful. This place is well worth every dollar."}
{"text":"Met up with work colleagues at this restaurant for lunch. Ordered the Beef Bulgogi and glass noodles, the Bulgogi was absolutely delicious as were the noodles. This restaurant has good food but can definitely use a makeover and some renovations. It appears that for the prices they charge ($16.95 for a Bulgogi) they can afford to get some major renovations. Asked for a glass of water and it was unfortunately served in a plastic cup which made the dining experience a little disappointing. Overall not bad, food is good and service was fast."}
{"text":"We have tried a fair amount of Korean places since my wife has decided she loves Korean Food. This place is small and not the best decorated place, but the food is no soubt the best in Calgaey. The Beef Bulgogi as the nestraunt is named after can not be match at any other Korean Restaraunt. BTW the Korean Pickled Radish is also the best we have found. What this place lacks in atomosphere and size it makes up for in taste and quality."}
{"text":"The food is under average. The attitude was too bad. The WORST attitude ever! Wow~ this is the second time I've been here, and I hoped that they could improve a little bit. But they did no at all. The attitude was as terrible as the first time I came here."}
{"text":"My friends and I had just finished a backpacking trip through the Canadian Rockies and were staying in Calgary overnight. We searched on YELP for a good Korean restaurant and this one came up.   The food was excellent, the bulgogi is definitely something to write home about, it was very tasty.  My only critique was on the side dishes, I felt like we were nickeled and dimed for the side dishes. There were 4 of us total in the dinner party and we got the same number of side dishes as a table for 2 or a person dining by himself, and if you asked for more side dishes, you were charged extra."}
{"text":"My mouth waters just thinking about this place. It's a quaint, family run joint with a warm atmosphere. The bee-bim-bab is always awesome and the kimchi is made on site! Goes well with soju..."}
{"text":"I came to the Bow Bulgogi House with some friends. We made a reservation beforehand, as we had read that the restaurant is quite small and can get pretty busy. When we arrived, the restaurant was full, and the very kind gentleman said it would be a few minutes to get our table ready. We ended up waiting 25 minutes before we were seated, which was annoying as we had made a reservation. When we were seated, we quickly ordered our food. It took nearly 30 minutes for our food to arrive. I will say the food was definitely worth the wait. I had the Beef Bulgogi, and it was yummy. Great comfort food. My friend had the Be Bim Bap, and quite liked it. I think I'd try that next time I return. Hopefully if I make a reservation, I won't have to wait a long time again!"}
{"text":"Came on a whim because the bf and i were looking for somewhere close to home that served viet. The restaurant is small and apparantly has bad heating because space heaters were pulled out making the space even more cramped. Being that this is a mainly korean restaurant I opted for trying out the beef Bulgogi and was very glad i did! Very large portion that i couldnt finish myself and ended up sharing with the bf. I've never had any type of korean before this and was very impressed and surprised that I enjoyed it so much. It was served on a sizzling hot plate and came with a variety of sides to mix with. The bf went with his usual beef sate pho which we'd not recommend. Broth tasted pretty basic and doused with spicy sauce.  Nonetheless we plan on returning to try more of the Korean food out and definitely out weighs the negatives of the space."}
{"text":"Best Family Korean BBQ in Calgary, been going here for years.  Ambiance is simple but it gives it a bit of Character! the Short Rib Bulgogi and the Tofu are what keeps me coming back.  Only thing is don't go out in public after you eat here, you will definitely smell like the food! My wife leaves her jacket in the car everytime LOL"}
{"text":"We are visiting Calgary and new to Yelp. Found this restaurant as we were craving Korean food. The kalbi, kimbop and pork bulgogi were AWESOME! We had to go back the next day because our 3 year old said it was her favorite ever! We will go back again during our 5 day visit!"}
{"text":"Food here is always great! Owner operated and delish. Kinda located in a hole in the wall but the food is always high quality. Try the bulgogi!"}
{"text":"Favorite place for Korean in calgary!  Get a great home cooked authentic style Korean which is hard to come by.  Good service. Consider reservations recommended as the restaurant is quite small."}
{"text":"Food was good but not the greatest Korean food I've ever had. This store serves white rice and the food is a little pricey. The side dishes given are extremely small and bland. Service is just bad. The lady that works there doesn't even pay attention to you. All she does it watch the TV. She doesn't even try to act grateful that people are here to eat. If you want a quiet place to eat though I recommend here because nobody comes here."}
{"text":"After making the foolish attempt at going to Anju for dinner without reservations,  Ihad to find another Korean place. I remember a friend telling me that I had to try Bow Bulgogi.  In it's non-descript location it would be easy to pass it by, but a grave mistake. I ate the beef bulgogi and bi bim bap, kim chi and deep fried tofu to start. Twas glorious.  I have nothing bad to say, food was good, prices were decent, waitress was cute.  5 \"kim jong il's\" out of 5"}
{"text":"OK. Really? No one reviewed this place? After 4 months in Calgary, having just spent a year in LA (a zillion Korean restaurants), it's been a hard slog in Calgary.  But Bow is a comforting place. Their eponymous item is fine, but the other things, like the noodle soup (not the Vietnamese ones they serve...what the?) are really good. Oh, their tofu buchim is excellent.  It's small, cozy, and as much of a slice of home as I can find so far."}
{"text":"One midweek day, a friend and I decided to walk here for dinner. That ended up being an excellent idea. I'd passed this place numerous times, either in a bus or a car. I had the beef Bulgogi, and it was both quite filling and really good.   As other reviewers have said, this is definitely a hidden gem. It doesn't look like from outside or inside even...but the food is quite excellent. The presentation is quite practical and clean.   If you are in the neighborhood and looking for some good Korean food, I'd highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Had dinner here. Good was great and service was fabulous. Restaurant is a little small, but well worth a second visit."}
{"text":"We got the bulgogi, Kalbi ribs, and pork bone soup. Very good flavor for all the dishes. However the portions were lacking. I will be coming back since their food tastes much better than other big name korean restaurants"}
{"text":"food is okey. But waitress has awful attitude. Won't come again. food is okey. But waitress has awful attitude. Won't come again. food is okey. But waitress has awful attitude. Won't come again. food is okey. But waitress has awful attitude. Won't come again."}
{"text":"The first time I visited Bow Bulgogi was when I had arranged a meeting with my cousin. It was reminiscent of one of those sit-downs you've seen from the Godfather, though I'm not Michael Corleone and we're not plotting the demise of the heads of major crime families.  The dining room at BB is cozy. I love places like this where you can just kick back and have a conversation, or clandestine meeting, without the distractions of a booming soundtrack or a noisy crowd. The service is fast and friendly and I can't complain about the food.   The menu is a nice cross section of many familiar Korean favourites like kalbi, bibimbap, and bulgogi. The banchan (little side dishes) are plentiful and delicious. Nothing here is 'elevated' or 're-interpreted'. The food is what it is, and it's good.  I always say that I am a huge supporter of small family business and this one is no exception. This is a great place."}
{"text":"This family run Korean restaurant is tucked away on the ground floor of an older commercial complex that is predominantly full of Chinese businesses.  It feels very homey and though I've never seen it full, there is always a steady stream of customers until the closing hour.  The food is simple, delicious and comforting - not the best Korean food I've ever had, but still yummy and it definitely hits the spot.  The Soon Tofu and Pork Bone soup is always pipping hot.  Parking is free and plentiful, but horrendous.  The parking lot is very cramped, but there is plenty of parking in the parking structure right next to it."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 Atmosphere: 3/5 Service: 3/5 Overall experience: 4/5  (1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)  I finally decided to try Bow Bulgogi after hearing rave reviews and the fact I wanted to try a new Korean restaurant. Came here with a large group of friends and we all had a great experience. The overall quality of the food was fantastic but it's out of my way, and didn't have a few of my favourite Korean items like Kimchi soup.  Bow Bulgogi is a pretty small restaurants with about 10 or so tables. It's a mom and pops restaurant so the decor was nothing too fancy- cheap red seats, checkered table cloths, and the walls lined with Korean advertisements. The service was good, they were very patient in taking our order since we were such a huge group, and the food came out in a reasonable time, piping hot.   Each meal comes with your traditional Korean side dishes of bean sprouts, pickled daikon, kimchi, and fried tofu which was yummerz! Freshly cooked with a light batter! We ordered the Chap Chae ($12.95) glass noodles with black mushrooms, vegetables, eel, etc..; Pajeon seafood pancake ($13.95); Beef Bee-Bim-Bap ($12.95); Yukgaejang ($10.95) spicy beef brisket soup with noodles; and one of each of their Korean style BBQ - beef, pork, chicken and La Bulgogi ($12.95). Their menu also consists of a few Vietnamese dishes.  When I compare this with other Korean restaurants (and I\"ve been to quite a few) the prices are about average give or take a dollar. However, the overall quality was top notch . The Chap Chae was super flavourful but was disappointed that the portion was smaller than what I usually get. Their seafood pancake is by far the best one  I've had for a great price! The pancake was large and crispy, full of juicy seafood and fresh vegetables. It wasn't overly salty and despite the pancake being extremely thick, it was still really light and fluffy (not gummy or soggy). This is a great dish to share since you can get about 6 large slices from it. My bf got the beef bee-bim bap which was a little bit disappointing because it wasn't in a stone pot and was pretty small. If you love spicy soups, try the Yukgaejang which is really spicy for someone who doesn't each a lot of spicy foods, but has a slight burn for those used to it. The broth was a little watery and was hoping for a stronger beef taste. Lastly, I suggest trying one of their BBQ meat dishes which are all absolutely delicious. You can definately tell they marinated their meat well, with the final product having a strong sweet yet garlic and peppery taste.   Overall, this is a fantastic place for authentic Korean food and I suggest a visit. It's definitely a trip down to flavour town!"}
{"text":"Food was good and I would go there again. The reason for the three stars is: 1. Portion size is on the smaller side from what I am use to. 2. Wasn't as authentic like no Korean (barley) tea; served Chinese green tea and no cooking at the table. 3. Small and you leave smelling like the food you just ate. 4.  Only had a choice of 4 side dishes and they really limit how much they give you per meal ordered. 5.  I was the only asian family there.  A clear sign that this is not where the local asians are going."}
{"text":"Love this place a lot. Been going for years now and continuously come back to it. Never tried their Vietnamese dishes before so I have no say in that, but everything that is Korean is wonderful.   My favourites are the bibimbap, kimbap, beef bulgogi, and the side dishes. I always end up ordering a large despite the cost ($7) because I know I'll want more after the initial free smaller side dishes they give you.   The owners are incredibly nice and they always have wonderful workers as well. Everyone here is super friendly and always serves with a smile.   I live 30 minutes away and still make the effort to come here because I love the food that much. Haven't found a Korean restaurant that offers such great foods with great flavours, this place honestly can't be beat."}
{"text":"So my bestfriend was in from Winnipeg  and  our mutual friend Jen decided to take us out to Bow Bulgogi House. This was my first time having Korean food and Grace has been  to Korea before so this was not new to her.  I loved it and I will be going back.   I only have 2  negatives to say  so I'll just drop that first.   It was HOT in there. They need AC or something and also it's very small I think there are less than 12 tables.. I'm not sure.. Luckliy a table just left when we got there.   It's my first time eating Korean so please bare with me on this review.  I wanna try the ones where you cook yourself.  To start they drop off these little dishes with pickled veggies and  kimchee and tofu.. yummy  I liked them all but not a BIG fan of Kimchee.    Tofu Buchim - Yummy Tofu,  my friend Jen can eat the large all by herself. It's soooooooooooooo good and healthy. It says on the menu roasted tofu, i think it's pan fried but I don't know. It's served with this light soy sauce that's a bit sweet and salty but not strong.   Dumplings - yummy hand made dumplings I liked these a lot - maybe they should put a bit more dipping sauce as it's yummy and home made as well   Beef Bulgogi -  Nice good portion and flavoured well   LA Bulgalbi aka Short Ribs  - Yummy and my favorite. They even cut them up in pieces for you   Pha Jeon (korean pancake with seafood) - It sounded interesting so I ordered it.  I personally wasn't a big fan of it. It had more of an egg quiche kind of texture BUT the portion is very LARGE. It had 4 diff types of seafood in it - but I didn't eat a lot but for sure it had imitation crab and mussels.    I forgot to mention that they serve lettuce as well so you can do wraps or you can eat it with rice.  One rice bowl for each meat dish comes with"}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to spots for Korean BBQ. It is not the newest, hippest place in town; it has the feel of a family operation that's been around for a while. BUT, let me tell you they have nailed it every time without fail when I go for the sizzling plate bulgogi!! It hits the spot, and that's what does it for me!  In my opinion, the old look just gives it character---as long as it's clean. It seems neat and well kept, and it looks like they did some light renovations recently. The reason they're not getting five stars is 1) I've heard the really authentic K-BBQ (the stuff you get in South Korea) is like heads and shoulders above the North American stuff, and I'm allowing for that, and 2) the newness of the place.  Apparently, they do some other dishes such as a super-spicy soup, but I don't think I could handle that. Try the place! Get the bulgogi, and you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I met up with her an old friend for dinner. She strolled in super late (GEEZ!!) and they were nice enough to accommodate the feast we ordered with only 15 minutes left till their kitchen closed.  We ordered the beef bulgogi, korean style pancakes, bow bulgogi bowl, and fried tofu buchim. The fried tofu was delicious but uncessary as the beef bulgogi offered a few morsels as a side dish. It was savory and salty with meaty depth. The bow bulgogi bowl was tasty and had veggies and noodles. It would've made a great meal by itself. The pancakes were really AMAZING and had very tasty fillings of vegetables, garlic, and seafood.  We couldn't finish it in the end but when I had some in the morning it was just as delicious as the night before. Finally our beef bulgogi-catered for one person, was a lot of food in itself. The beef was tastyliciouslymeaty!  I'd love to come back here in the future, it's a far drive from my south area, but certainly worth the trip :)"}
{"text":"I've been there several times and ordered different things on the menu. I really enjoyed bibimbap. Not expensive but service is still good. Recommend it!"}
{"text":"Overall rating 3.5 stars. Haven't been to this place in probably ten years or so.   I am sure it has changed hands but the basic decor is much the same with the cramped tables and diner like atmosphere.  The menu is now an odd blend of Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese.  We stuck with the namesake Korean to be on the safe side. The Kim chi appetizers were all fresh and tasty.  The freshly fried tofu with soy sauce was very tasty and was different than your standard fare Korean. We ordered the squid bulgogi, Korean egg pancake, and the bim bim bap.  Large and tasty squid dish.  Egg pancake was well, really eggy.  Felt very homelike and what you would imagine would be a homestyle Korean omelette loaded up by your grandmother with lots of good egg.  The bim bim bap was just ok and the portion was quite small.   All in all the food was a four.  However the price was on the high side as our bill came to $72 before tip.  But then again Korean is quite expensive relative to other Asian cuisines.   For the value I would knock it down by 1/2 star.  So 3.5 aggregate score."}
{"text":"Located on the ground level between two office buildings at Kennedy and Sheppard.   Parking is free if you park \"inside\" the parking structure but is paid parking if you park on the ground level parking.   Tried their lunch special pork bone soup and for the most part it was decent thought the potato tasted \"weird\" so I did not chance it.   The spice was low and the taste was OK.   The service is average and seating is a bit better than \"food court\".   Nothing outstanding but decent and authentic Korean in Scarborough.  We would probably come back."}
{"text":"By its outward appearance, an unlikely spot for dining excellence, but the Food is simply incredible. I really can't say enough about how much I enjoy eating here."}
{"text":"Good food and reasonable prices. They have a very nice lunch special for under 12 which I highly recommend (excellent portion size). The restaurant is small so if you are a large group call ahead.   I have tried their bbq meats which was good - hoping to try the soups next time. Either way I'm sure you can't go wrong"}
{"text":"The Korean food here is very authentic and delicious. The meat is always tender and juicy, and you always find some awesome side dishes here as well.   To be honest I always get take out, so I cannot honestly comment on the fine in experience. I can however say that the space is limited, but it is conveniently located by the train station and on 17th."}
{"text":"First time here.the server was very helpful and suggested the bulging which we had the beef which we had with the Kim nap was so tasty and very satisfying. We defiantly recommend  this restaurant"}
{"text":"I didn't know that I loved Korean food until tonight. We are in Calgary for a conference and went searching for some place interesting to eat for our last night.  Thanks to Yelp  we found this tiny restaurant and loved it.  We had the Korean pancakes with seafood and green onions, and the beef bulgogi.  Both dishes were very yummy. We didn't even know how to eat the bulgogi, but the waitress was very helpful.  I particularly loved how the meat, lettuce, and various toppings tasted together.  Now, I've got to find a Korean place at home that is just as yummy - hope I can!!!"}
{"text":"Food was honestly rather bland.. Other yelpers were not kidding. I read the reviews and figured I'd try it for myself. Staff were okay here and it seems family run. The flies are insane and I had to just keep swatting them away.. anyway. The place was a small size, rather cozy. I think the decor needs an upgrade but didn't really matter me.  Portions of food were okay. I had the pork bone soup and my boyfriend had beef bulgogi and we shared. The beef bulgogi tastes okay but the soup was quite bland. It has a nice kick to it though. I think there's better Korean food all over the area and better price points so i don't see us coming back or recommending this place. :/"}
{"text":"This is totally my kinda place! Family business with great food and an authentic feeling to it. The price is very reasonable, the portions are big and they bring you plenty of side dishes like kimchi, dubu buchim (i.e. pan fried tofu), namul, etc.  It's a small place and it's quite busy so I suggest making a reservation if you're a big group.  It's not a fancy place at all but the quality of food is excellent.  I tried the BBQ Beef Bulgogi and it's very very good. You are supposed to wrap the beef in lettuce and eat it and it makes it even tastier! I didn't get to try the squid bulgogi but the table next to us ordered it and it's the sexiest dish I've seen in a very long time! It's a giant sizzling squid! Mamma mia!"}
{"text":"Whether it's a lunch hour treat for my daughter and wife, a meal with the whole extended family or a night out with my \"fond of Korean food\" Tae Kwon Do buddies we head for the Bow Bulgogi House. Hard to say what is the second best reason that we go for, the first is the food quality - hot, tasty and well presented and proper portions.  The second could be the friendly staff, the comfortable atmosphere or the other clients who seem to be as happy as we are with the meal. Reservations are a good idea as the seating is limited. For the vegetarians among us (my daughter) there is a good selection and the staff are happy to help point out the choices. For the carnivores  - they will be more than happy. As an aside, the side dishes are fresh and home made - I am especially fond of the kimchi."}
{"text":"first time been to this resturant was 2 years ago with my ex bf... after that i move to edmonton, i cant remember where about is this resturant also the name. last year i visit calgary want to find this resturant,but i went to the wrong one. yesterday i going to calgary with my husband ,go on yelp check up review ,when i arriver there ,i m so excited ....cos i knew,i m by the chance to bingo.....  We take order spicy beef soup, clear noodle,short rib,pork......   Soup ju ok ,but is real spicy .....but noodle ,rib n pork was soooooo nice.  N they never mean with little dish n vy delicious too."}
{"text":"Got the Beef Bibimbap for $8. Side dishes: bean sprouts, radish, kimchi, sliced tofu, miso soup - everything was super small portions. Left there still hungry. Food was okay. The only positive thing was that they had Running Man (Korean variety show) playing on a TV with a computer - no English subs though."}
{"text":"The best Korean food in town. While I would have called this place as a \"hidden gem\" years ago, today I don't think it's very \"hidden\".  Many reviews and articles have heralded BBH as one of the best Korean restaurants in Calgary.  My favourite dish is the squid bulgogi, it's always perfectly cooked and the sauce is sweet and spicy. The presentation is beautiful as the whole squid is presented in a sizzling plate. The server then uses scissors to cut the squid into bite sized pieces. It comes with rice but sometimes I also order a side lettuce to make wraps.  My other favourite dishes are the spicy beef noodle soup and the galbi. The decor may be simple but the flavours are over the top!"}
{"text":"This place is really small but the food is great!! I almost felt like I was over at my Korean friends house having dinner. I'm definitely becoming a regular here."}
{"text":"This place is really consistent with shitty service. There is only one server and she snacks at the tables where guests eat while she watches the Korean program thats on. She gave me cold tea and  I asked if there was hot tea and she gave me hot water. After I placed my order with her she sat down eating popcorn as I was waiting for my sides. My main dish was smaller in portion compared to the sides. The flavour was really good but the price goes up while portions have been getting smaller every time. When my food came out, the rest of the staff also came out to sit and hang out while they watched TV. The server does not pay attention to you even if you try to make eye contact or have body language that suggests you need her for something. I'll admit the food here tastes really good here but it's not worth the headache and the price. I've been coming here a couple of times a year since they opened like 5ish years ago as I live within walking distance of this establishment and I always leave asking myself why I brought myself in."}
{"text":"It's been years since I've been to this place.  It used to be my go-to for a quick Korean lunch special (I remember when it used to be $9/$10 for the lunch special!) and the lineup for it went out the door.  Times have changed, the prices have changed, the portions have changed but the food is still great.  They always have a lunch special, I believe it is $12/$13 now for a delicious small bowl of chicken rice soup (think chicken noodle but with rice instead of noodles); a large plate of short grain rice, spicy chicken, a slab of beef short rib, mixed veg and a spring roll.  The meal comes with banchan side dishes of pickled diakon radish, kimchi radish and kimchi cabbage.  Ask for some free tea to wash down the meal.  Food comes out pretty fast and service is decent for an asian place.  Apologies for the semi blurry picture."}
{"text":"The restaurant is small and a little dingy looking, but the food here is very good and tasty. We usually order the Beef bulgogi and the ribs. The side dishes are also really good although the portions are a tad bit on the small side. They also do delivery."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! They use MSG in almost all of their food though, so consider yourself warned.   Get the beef Bulgogi. It's their specialty and it's flippin delicious. I lived down the street from this place for 3 years and never went in because it does indeed look a bit sketchy from outside. It's a very different experience, and pretty cheap   When we were there it was cash only. I'm not sure if that's regular or if their machine was just on the fritz. Anyway, it was delicious."}
{"text":"The lunch special is generally good. Not a bad place to hang out with friends in Calgary. Didn't try the others yet. Will come back later to check it out."}
{"text":"I've been reading about Bow Bulgogi for years! Yes, years. Bad Yelper Wendy for not acting on that sooner. Thankfully, I had occasion to head and eat a bit earlier this year. All I can say is... loves for Bow Bulgogi!  If you've never eaten Korean, one of my favourite things about eating it in restaurants is that you automatically get a serving of things like kimchi and things to snack on. It's kind of like the bread basket that shows up to your table in other restaurants... except swap out the bread for the kimchi and things!  I dove into the namesake on the menu, a big bowlful of Bow Bulgogi. It's a rice bowl filled with meat and veggie goodness... not to be mistaken with the Korean BBQ on the menu.  It's an unassuming restaurant, and not a spot to linger. We got busy chatting and ran into the time of the next reservation! Just something to be weary of... if you want an evening out, I'd recommend a second half to your evening after you've finished at Bow Bulgogi."}
{"text":"The bulgogi was tender,  the tofu was good,  as were the dumplings (which is made in-house).  It's mostly BBQ items, they have the usual, but if you're looking for not so usual items, they probably won't have it.  I found it pricey for the portions. It is in a smaller space so make sure u make reservations."}
{"text":"Stopped in based on a friend's request for lunch. Service is very quick and friendly. This is a real mom n pop shop in a plaza. You'd never know it was here! The decor is cheesy and dated but that's not an issue for us.   We both had the lunch special which included an awesome soup starter that had consistency almost like congee with chicken, veggies and egg. It was very tasty!  I easily could have had two bowls, maybe three!  Next came kimchi and sprouts and radish in tiny bowls. Our entree was a short rib that had been marinated in traditional soy, sugar and garlic and spicy bulgogi chicken / both very flavourful served with rice. For $12. You cannot go wrong!!! We will return to try other items like the dumplings and the bulgogi on a hot plate that the table next to us ordered, haha!!!"}
{"text":"I usually come here when I need a quick lunch. They have lunch specials every weekday. Their Gamjatang (pork bone soup) is worth a try, especially when you want some comfort food in winter. I like the taste of their Jajiangmyeon(black bean sauce noodles) but the size is a bit too small for me.  To be honest, the service here is not very good. The staffs sometimes don't pay attention to me. If you expect excellent service, this is probably not the right place for you."}
{"text":"On saturday night we stumbled into this nice little restaurant, its very small and quiet and even a little cramped But I tell you this place is certainly worth checking out!  As I entered this restaurant with two of my buddies I immediately felt welcome and like their was something just a little special about this place. We had to order fast though because we came right before closing time! We quickly gandered over the menu and chose the standard fare of such a place we ordered dumplings, spring rolls, pork bulgogi and chicken bulgogi , they immediately brought out the condiments ( Kim Chee,bean sprout salad,fresh pickled daikon salad, and the sweet bean chili sauce) and of course fresh lettuce leaves to wrap it all up in.  So everything ended up being delicious, the pork bulgogi was paticulary good, perfectly seasoned and cooked, really good! As far as the other food goes everything was well prepared with care and stood out from the crowd, the spring rolls were my least favorite though I still thought they were quite good. I would recommend this place to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Kim Chi was nice and spicy and crisp, bolgogi was also excellent.  Highly recommend this place, and price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time based on prior reviews.  My wife and I were craving for some Korean food, specifically a seafood pancake.  We had the pork bulgogi, Kim bop and seafood pancake and we were stuffed.  We had to take most of the seafood pancake home.  The pork bulgogi and Kim bop were great.  The seafood pancake was ok.  I'm used to thinner versions with more seafood, but overall was good.  Definitely plan on returning soon."}
{"text":"I had to check this place out as it literally is down the street from me and I read such great reviews on it.  I was underwhelmed by the decor and set-up of the restaurant.  It was quite awkward and a bit uncomfortable as we sat right next to another table who could hear everything.  Awwwwkkkkwwaaaarrrddd!  We ordered the Korean pancake and the Beef Bulgogi.  We received the Korean side dishes to start and I found them all quite tasty.  The Kimchi wasn't overly spicy which was nice for me but I know my boyfriend enjoys it much spicier.  Both dishes were tasty and flavourful.  I sort of wished the bulgogi came with a larger order of rice as it could have used it.  The pancake was full of seafood which was awesome and the dipping sauce it came with complemented it perfectly.  The restaurant got really smokey when all the hot dishes came out as they come on hot plates.  Especially the Galbi - korean ribs!  Wow!  The place was full of smoke!  We noticed the other table ordered the bim bim bap and we were disappointed to see that it didn't come in the heavy stone bowls.  That's what truly makes that dish!   I don't think I'd return for a dining experience but would probably do take-out for the convenience."}
{"text":"If I were to rate this place just on the bulgogi it would be a solid 5 stars. If I were to only rate on everything else, it would be a solid three. So I arrive right in the middle.   The beef bulgogi was AMAZING. It was tender, flavourful and an absolute delight in every bite. My husband ordered that I got the bi bim bop. I ended up piling some of beef into my lettuce wraps because it was just too good to let him have it all. We also ordered dumplings to start off our meal.   Like I said, the other items were a solid 3-star meal. I enjoyed them and I would probably order the bi bim bop again if just for the picked vegetables. But I have had others that have a more robust taste.   I would definitely return, but I would stick to the chefs specialties. If you don't want the bulgogi, I feel like you can get this level of food elsewhere in town."}
{"text":"I loved the dumplings in this place!!.. The spring rolls were good too.. And the rest of the food was not bad... I am not an expert in Korean food, but I think this place was ok... Also, the service was very friendly!!.."}
{"text":"This place has one of the best values for lunch! You can get a chicken and short rib combo with soup, side salads, and a spring roll for $10. I love the flavours of Korean food and find that Bow Bulgogi House does a fantastic job. I only have had lunch here because of its amazing value and quick service. The dinner menu seems worth trying. The restaurant is a little cramped for space so I'm not sure how accommodating it is for larger groups. This is a great little place to get a quick lunch with a small group of people."}
{"text":"It's my favourite place to eat Korean in the SW. I usually go and get the lunch special, it's such a great price for what you get. I'd recommend this place cause it's small and cozy(has a homie feel). Also the service is great the servers are really nice and friendly."}
{"text":"We were delightfully suprised with this Bow Bulgogi. The restaurant was quite small and is in a strip mall across E-Mart. We had a hair appointment beside the restaurant and decided to have an early dinner beforehand.  The server was very cheerful and seated us quickly. I believe the store is family owned and it really shows their commitment to giving you good service. Our orders came in quickly as well.  We ordered wonton soup, korean fried chicken bites, soju and LA Galbi. The food was great and was super surprised that their chicken bites were so crispy and tender. The wonton soup(huge bowl and full of veggies) and LA Kalbi was great as well. The food we ordered paired really well with the soju.  Overall, we definitely recommend Bow Bulgogi! And will for sure come often even when we are not booked for hair appointments."}
{"text":"After an hour long search for new eats that had us aimlessly wondering through Calgary's southwest, our indecisiveness was eventually rewarded with this little gem of a restaurant on 17th.  It is a relatively small seating area with the tables pretty close together making it a tad awkward as I clumsily worked my way to my seat right by this couple seemingly on a romantic date :).  However the setup made for a nice cozy intimate atmosphere which i tend to favor over the hustle and bustle of a packed diner.  The service was pleasant and swift , but that could be due to the fact we strolled in 5 minutes until the kitchen closed.  I ordered the spring rolls (pork, sprouts and vermecelli) and the chicken bulgogi.  I found the spring rolls to be on par as they should be and the chicken to be delicious with just enough spice to leave me wanting.  Also coupled with kimchi, radish strips, rice and a piece of green leaf lettuce and you've got yourself quite the flavorful wrap.  I am definitely anxious to hit up this tiny joint again in the future."}
{"text":"The family wanted a taste of home cooking and finding Korean restaurants in Calgary is more difficult than in Toronto. After looking at glowing reviews from various sites, we decided to head up to BBH for lunch. We ordered both the bulgogi and galbi; along with nang-myun. It was average and edible but not fantastic. The nang-myun was tasteless and overly sweet. The meats lacked garlic/onions and other essential spices. Part of all Koreans meals is the bahn-chahn (side dishes) and we could not eat any of it - the taste was strangely off. The owners noticed that we were not enjoying the food so they gave us a complimentary tofu dish - which was better. All in all, we needed to fill up a bit for lunch before going on to our next adventure and BBH filled that requirement."}
{"text":"If you live around the area you should definitely try this place, try the grilled pork you can't go wrong."}
