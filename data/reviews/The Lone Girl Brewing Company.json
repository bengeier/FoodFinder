{"text":"Lone Girl has a great atmosphere with a modern-hip vibe. The hubster and I stopped in on a Friday afternoon to check things out. The place was not yet packed so we found a place at the bar and ordered a couple of beers. I was a fan of the Off the Rails IPA, but not the Goldihops IPA. We had a look at the menu to see if we'd be staying for dinner. I was well aware of the Yelp reviews skewering the food, but I really wasn't very intrigued by the menu anyway. This, combined with the pricey drinks and the fact that it was by now quite busy and loud, prompted us to leave after our second beer and eat dinner elsewhere. LG seems cool, but we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Very neat atmosphere! 

However, food was average at best but beer was delicious!

I would come here maybe for just appetizers and drinks again!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and awesome environment.  Stopped here on our way home to Chicago from the Dells.  We loved the look and feel of the place.  Our group ordered almost one of everything and everyone was extremely happy and satisfied.  Servers were very friendly too."}
{"text":"Would have loved to try the food and beers.  Hostess seemed dumbfounded when we asked to be seated.  Waited for a minute for her to decide where to seat us.  I pulled the plug on staying as the initial vibe was not good.  Maybe some other time."}
{"text":"Just went here for the second time (first being opening night). Everything was totally different from the first visit this time around, and not necessarily all good changes. The chicken fingers and the cheese curds both seemed to have changed for the worse. The burgers have improved. I had the Matilda salad, and it was okay. Definitely heavy on the expensive proteins, but other than that-it was a little on the small side. Could have used more greens. Service was friendly, but the food took a long time to come out. I tasted 6 out of the 7 house beers (yay for flights!), and some were very good.

Overall, I think it will be a good addition to the (almost nonexistent) Waunakee dining scene. However, the prices here are high for the quality and the portion sizes served here."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. The rooftop is beautiful in the summer time. Loved the fish tacos."}
{"text":"Love Lone Girl!  We've been there several times now and have always had a great experience. The atmosphere is fantastic - sort of rustic modern. The staff has always been super friendly and fast too. They've changed their menu a bit each time we've gone and I've never had a bad meal or appetizer. I'm not a huge beer drinker but I do think their Oktoberish and Off The Rails IPA are pretty great. If it's warm enough outside, the rooftop bar and stage has been an amazing place to catch some really good artists.  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I would love to speak to the quality of the food but didn't get that far. Tried to call in a carry out order and was told that I could only carry out if I came there, ordered & sat in the bar and waited. That makes no sense to me.  I would've paid in advance so what was the risk?"}
{"text":"First time coming to this place and I can't believe how great the customer service was! We sat on the rooftop knowing it wasn't being serviced and ended up meeting the owner. He personally ran around and got us drinks when he didn't need to AND set up the projector for us to watch the cubs game! Definitely will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"First, let me start by saying, I want this to succeed so bad.  We've lived in Waunakee for 2 years and need someplace like this that is family friendly, but still fun for adults.  That said, we had a pretty bad experience at Lone Girl on Friday night (with two silver linings).  We had a big party with lots of kids (6 adults, 2 toddlers, 3 kids around 1).  We ordered some appetizers which were fine, nothing outstanding, but not anything that would keep me from coming back.  The beers we all ordered were a resounding success.  My IPA was much better than I'd anticipated, great hoppy bitterness (and those that had the Sweet Stout said it was good also). So, there's one silver lining.  

After the apps and beers is where the main issue began.  We all ordered our food, then sat, and sat, and sat.  Our waiter assured us that \"the kitchen is backed up\", and \"your food should be up any minute\".  We definitely weren't overly anxious because we know they just opened and they did get really busy, really quickly at about 5:30-6.  But, we waited over an hour for our food and finally after seeing 2-3 tables that came in long after us (also with large parties), we asked what the deal was.  Turned out the waiter had never even put the order in.  If you have kids, I don't have to tell you the situation at our table with that many kids, 2 of them toddlers, at 6:30 on a Friday night that are hungry.  

This brings me to the second silver lining: the manager.  I didn't catch his name, but he was overly apologetic.  Brought us a veggie plate and some fries for free to keep the kids happy.  Then gave us 25% off our food.  Exactly what should have been done.  

As for the entrees, my salad was a pile of spinach with some flank steak chunks and dressing which I was less than impressed by.  Others said their food was \"meh\".  

So, I guess, my comment overall is, get the service figured out, the failure by the waitstaff was pretty inexcusable, particularly when he kept coming back and telling us it would be out momentarily (which were lies since he never even put the order in, so he couldn't have been checking).  A bigger selection would be nice on the menu, as we all felt a bit buttonholed by the options, but the quality needs to be picked up a bit there as well.

However, all this said, we'll be back because, as stated at the beginning, we've been waiting for a place like this. But, the bar, the beer and the decor will not be enough.  There's plenty of places in Waunakee to drink, we need a place we can take our kids to, enjoy a meal, and still have fun as adults, which is exactly what Lone Girl promises to be with a few tweaks."}
{"text":"The brewpub looks great, the beer is pretty good, service was fine and the food is disappointing.  This is a really nice looking brew pub.  Definitely nothing like it in the area.  I have been four times and all four times had beers that I enjoyed and food that I did not.  If you have to get something to eat I would recommend the fish tacos they were OK. I would not recommend the burgers, both times I have ordered them they were some of the worst I have had.  
My recommendation is come for the beers and the ambiance then leave and get food elsewhere or eat before you go. 
Check this place out in the summer one of the best outdoor seating areas in the Madison area."}
{"text":"Lone girl is two blocks from my home, and I've waited for over a year for it to open. Needless to say, I was VERY excited to have such a cool place to possibly go for a drink after work, or  grab a bite to eat when I don't feel like cooking. 

The good, the place was clean, my friend and I sat at the bar (hostess was no where to be found) service was prompt. We were able to taste most of the beers before we bought. Excellent. 

Now the bad, sadly, the beer did not live up to the standards of Wisconsin (or Colorado) mirco brewing. The light beers were very light, but pretty hoppy (not my cup of tea, I prefer beers with more malts), and all I can say is they were girly, but not in a way that appealed to be. They lacked flavor and umf. I hope they work this end of things out. Maybe it was the early batches, but it was no where near places like Karbon 4 or New Glaus. It is a tough market and I hope they figure this part of the business out. 

In the end, I ended up ordering a cocktail ($10). I'm afraid I've forgotten which one specifically (obviously not that memorable, yikes!). It was served in a highball glass, but was mostly full of ice. Being a mixed drink, and being the lightweight that I am, I expected to feel it. Sadly, I didn't. So, paying $10 for a drink in Downtown Waunakee that was mostly ice, I felt kind of letdown. 

The food was fine (we ordered the curds), they were tasty, if a bit spendy. Total for a two drinks and an app was close to $30, which feels very expensive to me, since my drink was mostly ice and we ordered something just to be polite, since we didn't like their beers. 

In sum, I wouldn't say their beer is competitive (yet) and they need to notice how much their competition charges, and go from there. I also think depending on their drinks is a mistake, my husband and I occasionally feel like not cooking, but in Waunakee there aren't all that many options for going out, this would have been a fantastic option, but in the end, I don't feel like spending as much as I did to be pretty disappointed. I'll save my money and go places that might even be more expensive, but delivery quality"}
{"text":"pleased with the parking, bartender, nachos(( so good and fresh!!), and the rooftop would be incredible on a night like tonight. 

I hope they're here to stay!!"}
{"text":"We went there for dinner and the menu is a bit limited, but the beer selection and atmosphere are great.  The roof top bar was not open because it was very cold, but that looks pretty cool as well.  We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Service was great but the food was disappointing. I ordered a BBQ Pork sandwich and the portion was extremely small and had no flavor."}
{"text":"We went with friends on a Friday night for the fish fry. My husband and our two friends ordered the fried haddock and I had the walleye with pretzel cracker crust. We were not impressed. The haddock was lack luster and bland. None of them ate it all because it just wasn't flavorful. I had a taste and had to agree with them. My walleye was okay but the crust was a bit thick for my personal taste. The crust gave it nice flavor and the walleye was good. We decided we liked the atmosphere and would want to go back to experience the rooftop in the summer. Other items on the menu may be better (I hope!), so it will be worth the trip back come June or July."}
{"text":"Great building. Friendly bartenders. Table wait staff very defensive about our comments and seemingly spread too thin on a Friday night. The menu seemed exciting. Nachos came out, looked great, and tasted great. Entrees were another story. Their version of surf and turf consisted of a overcooked burger and a crab cake that was more did and filler than crab. Disappointing as the concept seemed unique. The buffalo chicken sandwich was chopped chicken, not shredded as billed. It made for a very messy sandwich as everything fell apart. Chips were grossly undercooked more like thin raw fries but not crispy as a chip should be. Three house brewed beers on tap: stick with the IPA, very enjoyable. Others not so much.n needless to say, they have numerous wrinkles to work out, especially in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, really awesome house-made beers, and perfect concept for kid or no-kid groups! The tavern chips are a must, and the smash and grab burger is a new favorite. For a young restaurant, this place is great."}
{"text":"Our party of five visited the Lone Girl for lunch recently.  Impressive building from outside and nice clean look inside.  It was not very busy during our visit and the service was adequate.  However, we were very disappointed in the quality of our food.  My adult son's chicken strips were very dry and way overdone.  His girlfriend could not eat the the cheese soup as it was so thick it was like paste and very bland.  My sister and I both had hamburgers which were OK but nothing special.  Overall, food was not worth the price.  Will not return for dining.  Owners obviously spent significant resources on setting up this restaurant/brewpub - they really need to put some effort and resources into some decent food."}
{"text":"first things first: vegetarian/vegans don't bother if you're looking for food. that said, the food we had was pretty good and priced what you would expect to pay in a Madison area brewpub. the best value is in the beer--flavors that aren't afraid to go bold. there's a light ale for the timid, but a beer fan should go for the generous build-your-own flight. i can't speak for the service as we came on a busier than usual saturday and the staff was doing what they could to keep up."}
{"text":"Had a great meal at Lone Girl!  Chicken sandwich was amazing - fresh tasting with the pico combo!  The ambience outside was amazing tonight and service matched that!!! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I've been passing Lone Girl on business trips since they were being built so when we finally had time on a weekend and were nearby, we stopped. Ordered a flight of all the beers and they were very good. We weren't hungry (just stopped for beers), but we saw the chicken and waffles walk past and had to order them so we split that- they were excellent! The roof top is beautiful and comfortable. Absolutely gorgeous restaurant and the waitress was very sweet and attentive."}
{"text":"Not what I expected, seating a little uncomfortable food well maybe I should not have ordered something new, sauce I had to scrape off and so much lettuce it was falling all over the table and me ended up picking the fish out of the fish taco"}
{"text":"Overpriced and extremely poor quality food. You can get better food at Culver's. The only thing going for them is their patio. Probably have high schooler's working in the kitchen who don't care about food quality."}
{"text":"We stopped here after a trip to the Dells.

To see such a beautiful brewery in the heart of Waunakee is so great. The space is beautiful and the owners were even dining next to us, the founder checked on our table after they had finished eating.

The food menu may feel limited to some, but it actually narrowed down some nice choices that fit everyone in our party's needs.

I ordered the Surf & Smash, a burger with homemade hushpuppies, slaw, and aoli. You're thinking, huspuppies on a burger? Get rid of the picture of deep-fried cornmeal ball, popular in the South out of your head. These are formed closer to corned beef hash in appearance. Think a smashed crab cake, made up of a blend of shrimp and crab. The burger was very good, tender beef and the hushpuppies gave it an added flavor.

I loved that the house fries were a mixture of sweet potato and regular fries. They have a nice selection of their own brew, only a couple of IPAs though with ABVs hovering around 6.5%, if you're a snob. Most of the beer ran around $5 for a pour which was decent.

Of of our companions ordered the Fish & Chips and it came with a Orange wedge, which was off-putting."}
{"text":"Stopped in for their Fish Fry and it turned out it was only their second week of it! It was an overall good experience. Nothing was horrible, but wasn't spectacular either. Would definitely give it another chance to make sure it wasn't just what we ordered that time."}
{"text":"Great beer and really neat building! Looking forward to coming in the summer and checking out the patio."}
{"text":"Excellent decor, service, and food. I just had the seasonal vegetables and my husband had a burger. Everything was excellent and we loved our server, Ann. So friendly and provided outstanding service. This is a very nice area and their rooftop bar also looked amazing! I wish they were in the Milwaukee area."}
{"text":"Excellent food and even better beer!  The burgers are huge!  Fries home-made!  If you are in town, you have to stop in."}
{"text":"Good food but a little pricey with OK service and a limited menu."}
{"text":"The hostess asked us how many were in our party and disappeared for the next 10 min. We had hungry toddlers and the restaurant was not busy. The food was a complete disappointment. They forgot a meal, didn't pay attention to special requests (like no sauce on a burger), food was cold, and what we did get at the right temperature didn't taste good. We won't go back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more.  I really did.

Likes:  The establishment is lovely.  We went for our annual Friendsmas and had quite a large group.  Our server (I believe her name was Katie) was fantastic!  Attentive, friendly, easygoing, and calm....  Everything you could want in a server!  I also enjoyed the Muenster curbs (no, that was not a slip of a finger...  they are called \"curbs\" here).  I mean, how could you not love gigantic cubes of deep fried cheese?  It's what Wisconsin is all about!!

Dissatisfactions: I found the food to be quite pricy for what you are given.  The portions aren't bad, but I found the food to be quite bland.  I ordered the chicken sandwich.  It looked amazing; however, it did not tickle the tastebuds.

Things I Need to Explore (If I Go Here Again): Due to being hopped up on DayQuil, I didn't think it would be a great idea to drink.  So, trying their beer would be the next thing on my to-do list at Lone Girl.

Overall: If someone suggested meeting up at Lone Girl for dinner, I'd probably shrug at the prospect rather than jump for joy, but I wouldn't shut it down completely."}
{"text":"Lone girl is great! I don't do this often, but i enjoyed the nacho appetizer as my entree. They put pineapple, cilantro and your meat of choice on those loaded things. WOW, they were good! I also, tried their problem child stout. Loved that! Very malty and not too heavy. I wish i could buy it at my grocery store...but i can't, so i purchased a bomber and took it home :). 

IF you are in the area, i would recommend a stop for a drink or some grub!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!! We held a surprise party here on the beautiful rooftop last weekend and the Lone Girl Team could not have been more wonderful to work with! I am a detailed person, and they were so responsive to my many emails confirming the smallest details and agreeing to facilitate the perfect surprise! Our guests loved the food (we did all types of gourmet flatbreads, buffalo wings, and veggies/dip) and especially the drinks - our awesome server was so attentive, always making sure people had a drink if they wanted one, and even remembered what most had ordered (which is super impressive considering we had almost 40 people there!). The bartenders were so friendly as well, addressing guests by name and making the most delicious fresh berry mojitos! For the party, we were able to bring in all our own decorations, as well as a sheet cake (which Lone Girl brought out for us during the singing of \"Happy Anniversary\" and also provided plates and utensils for). The weather was fabulous, so the rooftop was the perfect atmosphere, but they also had a great back up plan to use the unique and inviting indoor space as well. I cannot say enough good things! So GO - have a party (or just be your own party) at Lone Girl ASAP, wonderful experience in every way! :)"}
{"text":"Awesome food and beer. There is always something new, like a great special or a new beer, never disappoints."}
{"text":"I've been to Lone Girl twice now. As a restaurant, it deserves exactly 2.5 stars. It is right in the middle of the rating spectrum. It's not terrible and it's not fantastic. It's just sort of there.

Let me say that the service has been very good during both my visits. Very attentive. 

I had the fish fry on my first visit. Fish was flaky, in a nice beer batter. Didn't care for the sweet potato fries mixed in with regular, but didn't see any reason to complain. On my second and very recent visit, I had the fish tacos. Meh. Two small tacos served with a big side of bland tortilla chips and some very mediocre institutional-grade salsa. 

In the interest of full disclosure, I did not try their beer during either visit. The atmosphere is lively and this is clearly the most upscale dining venue in Waunakee. The prices are not cheap, but there is plenty of new money in Waunakee to support a locally-owned, non-chain restaurant and bar / microbrewery. The question is how long that support will last, given the mediocrity of the food.

The lack of any upscale dining competition in Waunakee may just be the best thing Lone Girl has going for it."}
{"text":"What a fun place! They have a beautiful patio with lots of high top tables and a full bar! I enjoyed the cider that they had (Blake's) and my boyfriend got a sampler of 6 beers. We got the wings and the burger for dinner and it was pretty good. My only qualm is that the service is a bit slow - there seems to be a lot of servers, but they sometimes seem confused about where the food is going and drinks sit at the bar for a while before they are delivered. Other than that - it's great!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. We stopped at 4pm on a Friday. Waited for 20 minutes to get served at the bar. The bar was nearly full with only 1 bartender and I can only assume she was new, it appeared she was reading the recipe as she made the specialty cocktails. The menu said it was Happy Hour when we asked about the special we were told it no longer included Friday, ok....but then another couple asked about the specials and were given the Happy Hour prices. We did order food, it was good but pricey. I will be in Madison on business until August but probably won't return here."}
{"text":"Lone girl gets my business for the fabulous upper deck.  Even madison is hard pressed to beat it.  Beer is OK, food has gotten a lot better than when they started."}
{"text":"Lone Girl is simply fantastic. The food, staff and beer is excellent. Love the rooftop and the fact the owner is a Cubs fan"}
{"text":"We stopped in after 1 pm on a Saturday for a drink and some appetizers. The main dining room on the ground floor had a large table with a bunch of little kids and their handlers at it, so we headed upstairs to the rooftop deck. Even after 1, the place was hopping. Plenty of servers to keep the crowd well lubricated and fed.

The staff was very attentive to find us a place in the shade. We ordered a Speakeasy Ale, the Berry Mojito, an order of the blood orange wings and the tavern chips. The wings were very good, I think if I ever came back with a group I would recommend two orders. The chips were meh, not something I haven't had before. I doctored at home them to eat later. The Ale was good and so was the Mojito. I agree with the other reviews who say that the prices could be better for what it is. 

It was pleasant enough in the shade and it was high enough up that the non-stop heavy traffic on the main street could barely be heard. A head's up, Waunakee is definitely a suburb, so if you don't want to hear the non-stop loud piping of little ones all through your meal, you might want to avoid the place."}
{"text":"Hurray for the only Waunakee in the world for remaking their Main Street! And The Lone Girl Brewery and restaurant is one of the newest additions. It is very large with a lot of seating, inside, outside and even on the roof!
The menu has enough variety for most, including salads, burgers, sandwiches, and entrees, but I feel the items are pricey. The hamburger special on Saturday night, was $14.50. I had two fish tacos, which were very good, and priced at $8 as a \"shareable\". Unfortunately,  my husband had a beef stew entree in a shallow bowl, for $14.50, which literally had only one very small piece of meat in it! Although, it included bread for a filler.
We were on our Goldwing, so we opted not to try the beer, so I can't say anything about the drink menu. But I did notice a special with a flight of 4 kinds of beers and 4 kinds of chocolate for $16.50. Beer and chocolate? 
Lone Girl was very trendy and busy. I will try it again-maybe for lunch."}
{"text":"Lone Girl has become one of our go to spots. The menu is diverse and everything is prepared with fresh and local ingredients. The setup and atmosphere is really nice and welcoming. Service has always been top notch and their rooftop seating is awesome."}
{"text":"The beers at this place are fantastic! The new AppleSauced should be available year round! Love being able to hangout on the rooftop and enjoy the warm fall days."}
{"text":"The Fried Turkey Club special is AMAZING. Probably the best Turkey sandwich I've ever had in my life. Props to the chef on the chimmichurri aoli - so good. They should put this one on the menu!!"}
{"text":"The four of us stopped in at 3 p.m. on a Saturday afternoon and were promptly informed they wouldn't be serving food until 5 p.m. So, we were warned. We got a table and had several glasses of wine or beer. At 5 p.m., we ordered a bunch of different apps and meals. I tried the nachos, beer cheese soup, cheese curds and chicken tenders. None of them were very impressive. Then we got the bill, which was $200, including tip. That means we each ate/drank $50 worth of food and alcohol. (I had two glasses of wine, chicken strips and soup). Then I thought about what I could get for that same amount of money at other restaurants/brewpubs, and what we got at Long Girl wasn't worth what we paid (in my opinion). 

I get that they want to be known as a brewery first and restaurant second. So narrow down your menu and focus on doing a few dishes right and charge reasonable prices. 

I will say the service was excellent and the ambiance/decor was great."}
{"text":"Waunakee was long overdue for a place like Lone Girl. It has been our go to place since it opened. The owners and staff are by far some of the nicest/genuine people you will meet. 

We look forward to getting our Friday Fish Fry weekly emails to see what the special is.  Some of my regular menu favorites are the Hush Puppies, Nachos, and their delicious Beef Stew. If you like a sweet alcoholic drink, then I recommend the Berry Mojito.  In the restaurant industry sometimes, you may have an issue with your order, all you have to do is let The Lone Girl staff know, and they make it right, if given the opportunity.  

The roof top is a great place to be on a sunny day or on a semi-chilly night with their fire pit blazing.  We even enjoyed a movie on the rooftop this summer. If you haven't caught a basketball, baseball or football game on their big screens, you are missing out(they show other sporting events too, but these are my personal favorites).

The Lone Girl is the best place in town for Birthday or special event gatherings. We had a blast at their New Year's Eve Party and can't wait to ring in 2018 there!  Thanks for an awesome 2017 Lone Girl crew, we have really enjoyed hanging out with our friends or doing date nights at The Lone Girl."}
{"text":"We came for dinner as part of a large group on a busy night.  This place was outstanding.  The beer was tasty, the food was excellent, and the service was awesome.  They handled our large group very efficiently, while being friendly and professional.    

I had the ravioli, which was amazing.  It was much better than I would have expected for a brewery.  Lone Girl is now a \"must-stop\" meal for us any time we are in the Madison area.  I just wish this place was closer to home!"}
{"text":"SO HAPPY to see things on an upswing for the Lone Girl! 
Originally dined here on the 2nd day of operation and of course, it always takes some time for a new venture to get on it's feet---They've hit the ground running now!

Our service (from hostess/seating to ordering to clearing and checking-in) was quick, attentive, and kind but not overwhelming. Our food came out sooner than we anticipated and was hot and well presented with good portions.
We had the surf and turf style burger (crab cake on top of a regular burger) and the fish tacos -- both thoughtfully prepared flavors.   The wheat beer and bloody mary were also spot on! 

This is a beautiful space with a great vibe - Can't wait to return to enjoy the top-deck patio and fireplace (it was raining when we were there so we missed out!).

Lastly, the owners are the nicest, salt-of-the-earth family---they're doing great things in and for Waunakee!"}
{"text":"Interesting!  Hamburger looked like it was cut from a tube of meat. My wife said that if you can't handle a hamburger then it will be only a matter of time. I had the fish and it good taste but cold and the coleslaw tasted like mustard and room temp. This was weird with a small group of 6 upstairs a table of16 and the three of us on a Monday night. Not a big crowd. The fries were homemade but stale, soggy and cold as well on each of the plates. The BBQ pulled pork was good. This was our first time and last."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, but that's about all.  Food is average at best, menu is very limited and the service sucks."}
{"text":"Beer was warm and limited selection. Couldn't order food upstairs since they were too busy downstairs (sarcastic voice). Then as we were drinking our warm beer when the early customers upstairs got their food. Spoke with manager after and he didn't care. Our waiter was fine and felt sorry that he couldn't give full orders since it reduces his tip on the bill. With all the brew pubs in Dane county you can do a lot better elsewhere."}
{"text":"The beer is tasty, the building is beautiful, the service isn't bad. The rooftop bar is gorgeous. My major issue with Lone Girl though is with their food and how management has handled a pretty severe customer complaint. I am a chef, and am food safety certified. My certification is based off of the 2013 Health Code. Almost every food item on the menu contains something fried, and most of those items are crab cakes. This includes their desserts, both of which incorporate fried food, like a cookie dough egg roll that is fried in the same oil as crab cakes. Shellfish/seafood are part of the big 8 allergens. It is a larger part of food safety certification that it is neither business smart nor safe to have one fryer for literally all of your fried food, due to the large variety and prevalence of food allergies. There was a complaint made to Lone Girl via their Facebook page, saying that the menu is inaccessible to those with allergies, especially shellfish. The management simply said they hoped the patron would return to try a \"burger, soup, or salad.\" There is one salad that is available for those with this allergy. How management disregarded the severity of the complaint, losing not just one customer completely, but losing an entire community of customers, is not ok. As someone with a shellfish/fish allergy, and speaking for the patron with the deathly shellfish allergy, this is unacceptable. I still return for the beer, but cannot have more than one without needing to eat, which will make returning more difficult.

I will say, the beers that they made, when they first opened, were pretty tasty. I thoroughly enjoyed their sweet stout. They also did a great job at bringing in local breweries, and quality ones at that, for guest taps."}
{"text":"We came on a Friday night for drinks and conversation. Both were great! Sampled four of the house beers and a cocktail, all were delicious and well-crafted. We also tried the cheese curds which were seriously perfect. I am a cheese curd batter snob and these were great -- not too light, not too thick -- and flavorful. 
Great service too. Will be back."}
{"text":"The food is really good! The mac n cheese had a nice kick and great flavor. The service is a big issue all 3 times times in the last 2 months. Only had one drink my entire meal because no one checked on us and we sat at the bar."}
{"text":"Well, since I didn't get to eat their food, I'll give it a 1 star. (I'd give it 0 if I could.) I got there at 11:45 before any major lunch rush to order a burger. An hour later, I still didn't have my food and well, I only get an hour for my lunch break so I had to leave to come back to work hungry.

I will not be going back, not even to try the food.

That's never happened to me before and it is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Decided to come here for dinner with my husband and in-laws and boy, we were NOT disappointed! Thank you, Lone Girl Brewing for an excellent experience! 
1. Get the hush puppies. Always. End of discussion. They have risotto inside. Whaaa? Trust me. Just get them.
2. I ordered the fish tacos and my husband ordered the pork belly mac and they were both mouth-watering delicious! 
3. Oh! How could I forget the nachos! I don't even understand. The best loaded nachos I have had in a long, long time!
4. Katja was the best server! Ask for her! So genuine and friendly and she really knows the menu well! An excellent server!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Lonegirl for the first time and was disappointed. First of all, I was not impressed with the menu. More options are needed. Next, when our waitress delivered the soup I ordered, I asked for some crackers. She immediately told me we don't have crackers. Is it so unusual to put crackers in your soup? Oh well, the soup was not really eatable anyhow! The soup was barely warm which makes me question how long it was sitting out improperly heated. Too bad the food and food service is not good. The facility is beautiful."}
{"text":"My updated review for the Lone Girl is now based on my experience ordering from the menu. 

I'm not sure why my group of four waited 30 minutes to sit down at one of the empty tables that had sat empty during our 30-minute wait. Multiple people waiting and multiple tables sitting empty for 20, 30 minutes. I found this a little odd.

More pros and cons:

Pros:
-- Server was friendly and cordial.
-- Fun atmosphere.
-- Blood orange vinaigrette on salad was interesting and tasty.
-- Crab cakes were good.

Cons:
-- Cheese curds don't seem fresh. There's a noticeable difference between fresh vs. old cheese curds.
-- My entree salad was pretty good but overpriced. 
-- The side of bread with herb butter is a nice touch with the entrees, but the bread would be better toasted or grilled instead of just plain. 

All in all, a visit to the Lone Girl will be a pretty nice visit. While it may not be the best food on earth, it's at least worth a shot!"}
{"text":"I want to see this Restaurant survive; however, the wait staff is strangely in abundance yet always standing around.  Causing longer than desired service times.  The food lacks a real chef watching over every dish leaving for a table.  The two times I have eaten there the steak salad had stale and seemingly soggy crostini and the steak appeared to be a low cut of meat.  Burgers were overlooked and fries need to be hand cut to compete.  Please listen and attempt to improve and I will return."}
{"text":"Was here about a month ago for lunch.  My niece was in town for a hockey game and this place was perfect.I'd been waiting as reviews showed they were still going through opening pains, but they seemed to have them all figured out.  Drinks and food were as expected, and quite tasty.  Service was attentive like you want.  I wish I could give more details, but it was a month ago.  Music was a bit loud.  Not enough to say anything, but distracting for lunchtime conversations.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"We both ordered the baked haddock Friday Night special, poor man's lobster. Drawn butter was some sort of oil, that left a thick, bad tasting coating on our mouths. Definitely not butter, and it didn't even look like melted butter. When questioned, they replaced it with the same oil with a melted pad of butter in it. We both left feeling nauseated. Eating mints to displace taste. I would have paid $16.00 not to have had to experience those flavors. Never again!"}
{"text":"Great service, good atmosphere for Waunakee, very average food.  This could be a great spot, but the food is not up to the standards of the appearance and prices.  Pulled pork was like $13.  Needs to change pricing or make the food better."}
{"text":"We haven't been here to eat for a while so stopped in to see if the food and menu have improved. It has. I had a dish that i can't remember how to spell  but was meatballs in a red sauce.It was very rich and spicy and very good but needed a couple of slices of thick bread to both compensate for the richness and have something to wipe up the sauce with. Actually this would have made an excellent meatball sandwich, forget the dish. My companion had the turkey chili which was equally good but again very rich and spicy hot. Close to being too hot for me. It had corn and lots of other stuff in it but like the meatballs need some bread on the side. Both dishes were room temperature when got them so we had to send them back to be reheated. Not a deal breaker just a comment. I think whoever is doing the cooking here is a big improvement over our past experiences. They know what they are doing but need to tweak it a little.The menu is much better as well with choices other than hamburgers.We ate at the bar this time so can't comment on the service. The bartender was fine. We would try it again and hope this place makes it in Waunakee. There isn't many choices and the place is beautiful. They just have to be more consistent to bring customer back."}
{"text":"This is our favorite local establishment, great beer and impressive food. Menu isn't huge, which is more than made up for with the quality.  They also have a phenomenal rooftop beer garden which is a must see in summer."}
{"text":"Is it the best around the Madison area....? Eh, not really.  Is it the best in Waunakee?  Well, it's kind of the ONLY in Waunakee and thank goodness because Waunakee really lacks in decent food options.  Ok, end rant.  I've been here several times over the course of the past year or so and I'd have to say the food seems to have gotten better.  But the food comes faster, the burgers are thicker and cooked right, and the cheese curds....holy man, get the cheese curds.  They're lightly breaded and giant compared to your typical Wisconsin curd at other food joints.  Different and delicious - I appreciated them!!  I'm not in love with their fries but for the price you pay for a decent burger + fries, I'd say they're fine.  I'm not real familiar with their beers but everyone at my table always enjoys theirs.  The atmosphere is great and cozy and serves a fun purpose of decorating ideas for my home.  The one downside for me is that when the place fills up, its loud, so conversations at your table get a little tough.  Love that this place is in our town because its a good go to with visiting friends and family."}
{"text":"I went there with my family and another family. I love the use of Muenster for the cheese curds. They were great; it's always nice to see a variation of curds succeed.

I got buffalo wings for dinner. They may have been the best wings that I have ever had. My daughters freshly battered chicken tenders were also fantastic.

My wife's fish was just ok. Not bad, not great. 

Our friends all got burgers, which all looked like standard bar food. I'd say stick to making beer batters and keep frying stuff, cause they do that great.

One critique, you got boozy floats for adults, but how about you make your own root beer for us non alcohol drinkers! The place was filled with kids too, and I'm sure it'd be a hit."}
{"text":"I went to Lone Girl on Father's day with both of my parents. Overall, the experience was okay, but a few details left me very disappointed. 

I'll start with the good. It was a nice day so they were seating in the outdoor rooftop space, which is beautiful. It was hot up there (too windy for umbrellas), but we enjoyed being outside. There's a full bar, fire pit, and stage. I would definitely go back to see some live music at night. The beer was also good. I had a Ham the Astrochimp IIPA (great name) and really liked it.

Now the bad. The service was poor. It took about 10 minutes after being seated until the server came out. We also waited on our food for maybe 25 minutes after ordering, and everything, appetizers and mains, was strangely brought out together. They also ran out of a key ingredient in one of their only vegetarian dishes, so I was forced to go with the Spinach and Artichoke Tortellini. I would not recommend that dish, especially not on an 80 degree rooftop. 

Good space, good beer, bad service."}
{"text":"Appetizers were amazing,  this is why you get 2 stars, otherwise I would have given you none.  The service was terrible.  We got our menus,  ordered our appetizers and drinks,  waited a while for those to come out,  enjoyed our appetizers, Finished them, and then waited a very long time for our server to come back and actually take our orders.  We finally order and end up waiting at least 40mins only to have our food be cold, the soup was cold,  the chicken melt sandwich was cold,  the stew came out with out a spoon and one wasn't offered.  We finally got ahold of our server to ask for water and a spoon,  no drinks were offered even then.  Our water came out as we were all finishing up with our meals.   We originally ordered the \"Get in my belly\" only to find you were out of pork so early in the dinner hour.  Very disappointed in the experience overall."}
{"text":"Best food since I've been in town all week. Great burgers and great fries, try the cheese curds best yet also. I would recommend forsure"}
{"text":"We tried this place for dinner when they first opened, we were unpleasantly surprised there was no real dinner items on the menu. We were not in the mood for basic low budget bar appetizers priced way to high, like their soft pretzel for almost $11....wow that's CRAZY. After reading in the paper they hired a new chef we decided to give it another shot. It was not good at all ...the shredded chicken sandwich had a thickpiece of mozzarella cheese and a baked Parmesan cracker, it just didn't go together and it didn't taste good at all. We decided to try the s'mores cheese cake, which wasn't cheese cake at all... it was melted chocolate chips on a gram cracker crust with a little roasted marshmallow in the corner, served frozen in a small cast iron skillet. Again just weird.. why the skillet? It's frozen !!
Pretty sure the \"new chef\" is taking bong hits in the kitchen, there's no way any real chef can put together those combinations without being stoned and having the munchies. Bummer we would really love to have a great restaurant close to home, and this place has such a great setting, very misleading, you don't expect the food to be such a disappointment. Maybe they will hire a \"real chef\" before they go under."}
{"text":"Don't come here for the food. The menu is small, and surprisingly uneventful. At $11 for a pretzel, it's entirely too expensive for what it is. I've had a few dishes here (burger, curds, fries) and they've all been dry and bland.

The brew is ok, nothing ground-breaking. On the border of \"semi-decent\" and \"just brewing beer for the sake of marketing ourselves as a local brewery.\"

Maybe they're trying too hard to be the next Great Dane.

On the bright side, I have to appreciate any brewery that has a year-round milk stout."}
{"text":"We tried Lone Girl again. We were told it was a 30 minute wait. Fine, so we enjoyed a brew while waiting. We waited about 50 minutes and left. Apparently they have a new menu, we only saw the prices of some apps, about $10 each. I think there are many more accomodating options besides this place."}
{"text":"Food was good, but took over a hour to get chicken strips and fish tacos. Drinks were good but not worth the $10 a piece. Positives are the wait staff was friendly and the patio on the roof is nice."}
{"text":"Every time I go I have a different experience.  Sometimes there is great service, other times the service is awful.  

What are the specials?  No clue, they are listed on some random board that floats in the middle of the floor.  

I really don't like that the fries are mixed regular potato and sweet potato.  I really hate sweet potato fries, sorry but I do.  I have asked for them not to be mixed, but I have been told they are pre-done.

Booooooo.

The first time I was there, none of their beers on tap.  No burgers on the grill.  The good thing is that they have a full menu now.

My FAVORITE sandwich is the Sloppy Guido.  Pulled chicken, caprese salad and parmesan cheese.  Delicious.  All of it.  I keep ordering it which means that I haven't tried many things on the menu.  

The caprese salad is served on crostinis.  The first time I had the crostinis, they were too salty so I shied away for awhile.  The second time, they were done perfectly.  

The ambiance is nice but the room is so big that it gets chilly.

As long as they keep the Sloppy Guido on the menu I will keep going back."}
{"text":"The gumbo is probably the best I have ever eaten and the cheese curds appeared to be homemade.  The IPAs are worth checking out.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Came here for a recent Badger away game and couldn't have been more impressed with the food, beer, and service. This is a great spot to catch a sporting event, with plenty of TV's and a great sound system. All of their beers were $4 during the badger game, which is a definite steal. Great lineup from top to bottom. 

Their menu is really eclectic and different from most brewpub style places. Even the basic burger is far above average. 

The bartenders were some of the nicest we have encountered in the Madison area, and definitely made our stay better. It is a bit of a drive for us, but we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I will come back and re-rate, as they have only been open for two days. 

First if you are a new brewery and you don't yet have your own own beer, let people know!  It is totally understandable, but you have to tell that to people. 

Get Wi-Fi, if you believe in your products and services Yelp, Untappd and others are your friend. 

We did not eat, but all the good looked good. However the portions seemed a bit small and everything on the menu seems to be $2 too high.  Beer and drinks were slightly high priced for Madison and way over priced for Waunakee. $10 signature cocktails and $6 taps . All the guest taps are cheaper at their respective breweries.  They also has issues with their taps lines, so my pints were only 3/4 full. LOVED the fact of you get a cheap can of beer they give you a 4oz sample of their taps. 

The bar looks GREAT and the staff was working hard to get to keep the large crowd happy. They were slow and still need some work. The food and beer better be fantastic to justify the price."}
{"text":"I went here for a bit after work and tried the beer. The apps were great and the beer was tasty. I've also been twice for lunch and have tried the smash burger and the bbq pork special. I like the chips better than the house fries. Several of my feinds has drank all the beers and they like them all. I'd give it a three rabbit foot's up!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, underwhelming.  It's too bad because Waunakee needed a place like this. The beer is ok and the only thing that's reasonably priced."}
{"text":"So The Lee's got like 1 place to really eat downtown and this is it. Personally I love it. Great, beautiful space. Solid menu and they do you up right. Listen. You want a good place to eat, in the Kee, get down to the Lone Chick, get a great beer and some great food. Then shut up. Cuz it's the Kee, and we don't want no shenanigans."}
{"text":"I was incredibly apprehensive about coming to Lone Girl, as the reviews are all over the board, but there aren't a lot of options in Waunakee.  I met my sister-in-law here on a Saturday at 11:30a.  When we got there the restaurant was already half full (they open at 11a) but the bar was empty.  We chose to sit at the bar which was really nice until it got busy.  We had the bartender's full attention for about 15 minutes and then he was really hard to pin down.  The bar and the restaurant were full by noon and they had people on a wait list.  Unfortunately, there was only one bartender until well after noon - which would've been fine if he only had to serve the people at the bar, but he was also in charge of pouring  drinks for the restaurant.  This place is massive and there were a LOT of bloody Mary's going out - not the quickest drink to make.

The menu is very small but had enough variety.  I ordered their harvest salad and my sister-in-law ordered the wedge salad.  Both arrived fairly quickly and were very tasty.  I rarely finish an entire salad but I couldn't stop eating this one.  The chicken that I had added was over-cooked but well seasoned.

The space is truly incredible; very well decorated, wide open but (somehow) not terribly loud.  They seem to be well-staffed in the restaurant but could've used another bartender or two.  It looked like tables were being turned over quickly and people didn't have to wait too long to be sat.  I hear they have a really nice patio upstairs as well.  

I'd have to agree with all of the reviews that mention the prices.  I believe the salad was $14.50 and an extra $3 for chicken.  Two salads, a beer and a single vodka ran us $45 without tip...yikes!"}
{"text":"We were extremely disappointed, the service was terrible- we waited a LONG time between seeing her,  we couldn't order a second round of drinks.  We had fried Munster cheese and it was cold inside, the menu lacked many options that weren't heavy and the food we got (fries were cold) my chicken sandwich was meh and my husband's was undercooked.  We will not return."}
{"text":"Visiting family in Wisconsin and stopped here for dinner.  The adults ordered the cheese/meat/pickle tray to start. It was so weird...a\"play on a bloody mary \" as the waitress later informed us. So gross.  There was a ketchup like substance on the tray and then the makings of a bloody mary- cheddar and pepper jack cheese cubes, meat sticks, pepperonis, dill pickles. The pickles were just regular, from a jar kind of pickles. It was astounded how bad the whole tray was...a hipster joke gone horribly wrong.  Luckily we were w lots of kids who are always good for cheese cubes and meat sticks so it got eaten. 

Our food was surprisingly good consider how bad the cheese tray was. I had a black bean burger that was really tasty. My sister and her husband both had the special - a play on a croque madam. They were both happy. The kids all had cheese burger quesadillas and fries. The fries looked fresh cut. 

Overall I think this place is hit or miss.  Had we not ordered that awful tray I might've given them another star, but it pretty much ruined the meal."}
{"text":"Visited on A Monday evening to meet girlfriends for chatting and dinner.  The bar was about half full.  The chatting was a little difficult because of the noise level and the dinner SUCKED!!!  Suffice it to say the if you like cold food and a kitchen that doesn't really care about the quality of the food they put out, go here.  If you are just looking for a beer and a place to watch football this is the place.  Service was pretty good, waitress very nice and attentive.  Don't order the fries, I asked that they be fried crisp, because of the reviews of soggy fries, and I guess that was over the head of the cook.  All the fries that came out to our table looked like they had been taken off of plates that were sent back uneaten.  I ordered the pulled pork and they missed the mark here.  Not sure when serving cold food, that was suppose to be hot, became the norm in a restaurant.
If you want cold shriveled fries, cold pulled pork and hamburgers that look like grey hockey pucks this is your place."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my husband and a couple of friends for a couple of drinks. I had the sweet baby stout and the red banks amber. I liked them both. Flights are an option also. The cocktails on the menu sounded really good. My friend had the berry mojito and I had a sip and it was amazing! 

The food menu looked great, though maybe a bit pricey. We'll definitely stop in for a meal sometime though. 

I liked the feel and look of the entire place. Can't wait to come back to check out the rooftop patio when it's not raining. I would recommend maybe doing something with the glass doors to help make them a bit more visible. Our one friend nearly walked into the glass; it was daylight and he wasn't drunk, so I imagine it could be an issue at some point. 

We'll be back and I've already recommended The Lone Girl to some friends."}
{"text":"Strike 4
Have been here 3 previous times and have been underwhelmed each time. Food is average and a bit confused (orange with fish fry?). One visit was early on a day they were not busy and 2 of the 4 things we tried to order were not available and were told after our orders were in. 
Service is inconsistent and not very attentive. 
Final visit yesterday just stopping in for a beer around 6:30pm. Not busy. 
Sat at the bar, 5 min before I saw bartender. Ordered a beer and saw the bartender once before I finished. Did not bother ordering another as did not want to wait for his return from wherever he went. 
Don't think we will bother with anymore attempts"}
{"text":"Liked it the last time I was here. Came all the way from the other side of town to eat here to find every TV playing the Badger football game which was ok by me. It was so loud with the TV volume in all parts of the place including the restaurant area we just left. I guess they just care about making money hand over fist on football days they don't give a  about people who just want to eat. Wasted an hour of my life driving here for no reason so I will never return."}
{"text":"We had a great experience for our first visit to The Lone Girl! The food was good, the beer was great and the service was wonderful. The Stout was amazing! Try the burger and fish fry. Two thumbs up on the buffalo sauce! Ann W. was an awesome server!"}
{"text":"High prices for mediocre food. Fish fry was overpriced. Did not like the taste of the in-house made beer at all. They think they can charge high prices like Zoe's or Doughboys because of the amount of wealthy people in town, but the food quality should match them. Would not have come at all if I did not live in town. The only positive for me was the nice rooftop deck (visited in the summer) and the excellent interior decor. Probably will end up at my usual Gold Nugget next time. If you want a good Waunakee beer, go to Octopi. You can get a similar-quality fish fry for cheaper at St. Peter's Church in Ashton or St. Michael's in Dane at their monthly fish fries, plus they are all you can eat. If only the O'Malley Farm Cafe was still around."}
{"text":"Really great looking brew pub. Inside and roof. Operations though are a joke so far.  No food not even apps served on rooftop.  Was there Sunday and bartend over charged us on beers - not once but twice!   No tip for you chump."}
{"text":"The positives: Cool name and logo. Clean, bright, well designed space with indoor, outdoor and rooftop seating. Extremely friendly service. Fair prices. Interesting sangria cocktail with cabernet, elderberry and gin that I thought was awesome, vs. the person who ordered it who thought it was meh.

The meh: The beer. I had their version of an IPA (something about train tracks) which was described as citrusy, but instead it was very bitter and piney. The burger: arrived looking like it was cooked in a tuna can. Evenly brown on every surface, yet not even slightly crisped. Was the brown painted on, or what? (Also weird is that when you order it, the waitress asked \"pink or no pink?\" Huh? A normal server asks how you'd like it done, i.e. rare, medium, etc.) 

The burger had no seasoning whatsoever, adding to the odd blandness. Also, they have not a single pickle in the entire restaurant, so don't bother asking for them on your burger. The bun (a nicely done brioche, the best part of the whole deal) outsizes the burger by 1/3, and the extremely uniform patty with military corners is about 1.5\"tall and 3\" wide. I finally asked the super cheerful server, so, how was this burger cooked, anyway? She excitedly told me it was cooked sous vide. And did I know what that is?? 

Um, yeah. I sure do. It's how you DON'T COOK HAMBURGERS. (my thought bubble).

The shoestring fries are underdone, or cooked in too cold oil, or something...a big ol' pile of limp and greasy. My dining companion raved about her \"poutine nachos\", so there's that. It was a tossup between this brewpub and Octopi, and next time we're in Waunakee I'll definitely hope for a better meal at the other one."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised based on other reviews. It helps that it is a gorgeous 77 degrees and we're sitting outside. Wife LOVES the cream ale, and the stout is quite good. Lunch was excellent. The Reuben sandwich was delicious. Instead of the usual 3-4 slices of processed corned beef, they have 1 inch thick chunks of juicy deliciousness. The special hamburger, Croque Madam steak hache burger with prosciutto and an over easy egg was the best burger I've had in a long time. Thick, juicy and cooked Medium, not medium well. Wish I had taken a picture before I destroyed it. Daughter loved the buttered noodles, and the puteen app was delicious. Looking forward to coming back and sitting in the roof."}
{"text":"I was excited to check this place out due to a friend saying that it was so great. We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon to grab a beer and food. It was not busy at the bar when we came in, so we grabbed a seat to watch the game that was on. There were a couple of larger tables, but most of the people sitting down had their food already and/or were getting ready to leave. We ordered beers and then ordered food. My lunch date got their food first. Actually, the grilled cheese came out to us, the employee who brought it out realized that one of our meals wasn't on the order and proceeded to take the grilled cheese back to the kitchen instead of just giving the meal to the customer. The employee should have explained the issue (one of the meals not ready) and at least offered us to leave the hot sandwich while the other is getting prepared. So, a few minutes ticked by before the 'once hot' grilled cheese made it to us. By the time the grilled cheese made its way, the cheese was getting cold and started to congeal and was hardening. They then explained what happened and said that the reuben I ordered was getting rushed in the kitchen. I begged the employee not to rush my sandwich as we were not in any hurry. A rushed meal is usually not a good one. Within a minute, here comes by sandwich and fries. I've worked in a restaurant for years and I know this is not a good thing. The fries were cold and probably were sitting in the fryer tray for a while. Cold grease fries are not edible. The sandwich had a very very very soggy bottom bun. The meat was not properly prepared to meet the bun. The sauerkraut/onion mix, meat and cheese were all cold. I forced myself to eat half the sandwich because I feel terrible saying anything. I ate 2 small fries in one bite and that was enough for me to decide that I needed to say something. The server was sorry and offered another try at the sandwich. By this time, I was pretty disgusted and not interested in eating any more of that particular menu item. The food gets a 0 stars. The server was apologetic and I completely understand human errors. For this I give 3 stars. Please be upfront with customers about the error right away and offer to serve the hot food right away to those that have food to eat. Take the time needed to make a decent meal to serve the person/people who's orders were forgotten. That way, everyone is served a hot meal (maybe not together), but at least it's edible. At least you are leaving it up to the customer to decide the route to take. I wish I had my camera along to take a pic of the plate I got served."}
{"text":"I dig this place. Great ambience, good beer (Harry's coconut IPA), and good service (we got a free beer because they were testing out new music)...Good place for a first date or casual hangout. Old barn feel mixed with industrial vibes. They also have free Wifi."}
{"text":"Tried the food at Lone Girl again yesterday. The fries are 100 x better than before! They got rid of the coated fries that I hate. These were just simple and well cooked goodness. 

The BBQ pork smash sandwich was great. There were a lot of flavors going on. The thin sliced green apple added a welcome sweet crunch to the soft brioche bun and tender pork. I'd absolutely order it again. 

While I still think the menu is a little limited and the prices a little high, at least I know there are some tasty options that feel worth the price.

Service at the bar was good and we found a few beers that stood up to the food."}
{"text":"This was our second attempt for this venue, both were one-star experiences.  Our first visit was on their opening weekend and, well, they just weren't ready for paying customers that wanted food on a Saturday afternoon and/or to try their beer.  Opening weekends can be rough so we tried again.

This time, we stopped on Sunday evening of Labor Day weekend.  It was like we were in a scouting video for Bar Rescue!  Initially, there appeared to be lots of staff and most of the servers seemed pleasant when we entered.  We chose to sit at the bar as we wanted to try the beer flight and an appetizer while watching a little college football.  Forget the football, only the manager is allowed to change the channel and he was not going to be bothered (or maybe couldn't figure it out).  The server that we asked on her way past us did try to help us.  It wasn't busy but the bartender went from unfocused to just not being behind the bar for an odd stretch of time.  Then the shift changed, many of the off-duty staff sat at the bar for a drink and it was like we weren't even there.  Taking selfies was important for the group.  So you probably have that picture - a manager that was entertaining someone from a band that had been playing & not to be bothered, pleasant servers/greeting, off-duty staff becoming the focal point for staff interaction, bad service at the bar when it just wasn't busy, etc.

So the beer and appetizers?  The beer was reasonable, not great.  Several styles, they seemed to do the best with the very dark options.  The appetizer?  Nachos and we crazily said yes to chicken & guacamole as add-ons.  Dinner plate size, extremely messy and roughly $17 with the additions.  They were okay but not worth that money.  They may have been better than we recall because by then, service had just pushed us over the edge.  

The facility?  Very well done.

If you go, best of luck and I'd recommend sitting in the dining area because the bar was very frustrating."}
{"text":"I live not too far from this newish restaurant and was excited to try it out during Waunakee  rummage sale days and was HUGELY DISAPPOINTED. Host was overwhelmed by the volume of people, it took  15 minutes to be seated and then we waited FOR MORE THAN ONE HOUR for our TWO sandwiches, one of which was their daily special. When the table behind us received their food before us (even tho they were seated 15 minutes AFTER us) got their food first, I asked about it and was told that the Rueben was easier to make and that's why they got it before us. I've worked 15+ yrs in the food industry and can only say \"that's a ridiculous excuse\"... so you make the easier orders first?? 
Very very disappointed. On the positive side, the applesauced beer was tasty, but the service, and their reaction to our frustration will keep me from going back."}
{"text":"We visited here recently with family from out of town and our children. The weather was a little iffy but we took our chances and went to the beautiful outdoor deck upstairs. There are great toys for kids - our children were occupied the entire time. We sampled beers, shared the giant, tasty pretzel, and had the burger and fish platter. The food was fine. I'd love a grilled chicken sandwich on the menu. Waunakee really needs a place like this so I hope it does well. The staff was super helpful and friendly, which we appreciated."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here a few times. We really liked our dinner from the previous time (sorry, no review), so we thought we'd give it try again. This time it was for the fish fry and beer. 

We both ordered the same thing, the fried haddock with the salad bar. Comes with the choice of potato and salad bar. The salad bar was actually really good with a wide variety of toppings for your salad and, and, and warm delicious breadsticks. 

Our server was fantastic. Brought me a sample of the featured $4 beer. It was pretty good but I decided to go with the pale ale. My wife had an old fashioned, which she said was good. 

Overall, the breading on the fish was nice and crispy, light and honestly not too greasy. Coleslaw was the way I like it and the tartar sauce was fantastic, had a little fresh herb taste to it. The fries were good. Everything was good. Nice atmosphere. The place was packed (Badgers basketball was on too), but plenty of leg and arm room. 

We'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Awesome patio on the roof of the brewery. My friends first words, \"man, if the beer turns out pretty good, this patio could be bad news.\" Unfortunately the beer was just okay. The food was just okay too. Where they lost me was when I ordered puppy chow and the waitress proceeded to tell me the cooks didn't prep any for the day. Um what? Okay. :("}
{"text":"I had lunch and was very impressed with this place.  The menu is broad but since it was lunch I had the salad and soup and both were great.  

The service was excellent and the environment great with plenty of seating.  Will definitely be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Rock and roll!  Great brews + an inventive menu to match. Try the porter and bbq pork smash sandwich. Shout out to the buffalo drumsticks and wheat beer too. Come in the summer and sit out in the upstairs deck. Boom!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at The Lone Girl Brewing Company. I must say, it was quite nice inside and they did a really good job designing it, but that also probably contributes to their exorbitant prices for poor quality food. The beer was okay and reasonably priced. But $9.25 for cheese curds, IN WISCONSIN, give me a break; so needless to say I did not order those. I ordered the O.G. Patty Melt  with fries. The patty melt was a frozen burger patty with some cheese, onion and spinach. At $13, I expect a lot more than a frozen burger. The fries were like eating chewy cardboard. Had it not been for the friendly servers, I would have given them a one star. 

I live in San Diego and frequent breweries such as this one and even some more upscale ones, and they know how to provide decent food. And no I'm not a snob, I grew up in a small town in WI. I get what they're trying to do, but so far they have not succeeded. They need to hire new cooks and/or find new sources for their food products and maybe hire new kitchen staff/cooks. You can't attempt to bring an upscale, trendy brewery to a small town and then charge ceiling high prices for poor food. People can easily go across the street to the Gold Nugget and get a much better burger for at least half the price."}
{"text":"We went to Lone Girl on a Tuesday evening for a quick dinner.  We ordered the giant soft pretzel and it was delicious with the beer-cheese dip.  Other items that were ordered were; the fish tacos (decent but there was a bit too much slaw in them), the steak tacos (decent but the meat could stand to be a bit more tender), a cheeseburger (good), fries (very good) and the summer salad (excellent).  Our waitress Sarah was very attentive without being stalker-ish.  I loved the rooftop dinning area and the indoor decor is quite nice and on trend.  Parking is a breeze and the location is very convenient.  Everything was clean and our food came relatively quickly.  All in all I'd love to go back and try the crab cakes or the soup!  What a great addition to Waunakee.  
To the reviewer who complained about there being children at the restaurant...seriously??? Lone Girl is a family friendly restaurant.  If you don't like kids stay home...where you can yell at them to get off your lawn.  They have just as much right to be in a public space as you do."}
{"text":"This place is a favorite! I like the industrial design decor, and the food and service never disappoint. The fish fry is really good...I wish they didn't serve the super skinny fries tho...I've had their salads, burgers, fish...all delicious! The first time there, I had a beer flight, and the berry Mojito is also very good. It's fun to sit up on the rooftop deck during nice weather."}
{"text":"I really wanted to dislike this place, but i just couldn't. It's the name.  It just rubbed me the wrong way--I made the assumption that I would be walking into a honky tonk country music kind of place (my kryptonite), but i was quite wrong. 

I ordered the fish fry, and I was not disappointed. The breading on the fish wasn't too thick, and it had a great flavor. Beer, but not too overwhelming. The fish itself was flaky and delicious. I'm really picky about fried fish--sometimes you get that slimy layer between the fish and the breading, and then you're full of regrets. Not the case here.  Cooked perfectly. 
The fries were a welcome combo of regular fries and sweet potato fries, and they were perfectly crispy. The coleslaw had good flavor, and there was a little bite to it. 
On top of that, the service was friendly and efficient. 

I definitely recommend, and I'll be coming here  for fish again."}
{"text":"Unrealized Potential 
This place could be great. As Waunakee's only true mid-range non-supper-club venue, it has the potential to be a draw for people in north Madison and other nearby communities. The location is great, the facilities and amenities are  attractive, and they serve some great brews. But when your business is food, that's where you need to excel. 

We've been 3 times and have left unimpressed each time. It's not that the food is downright terrible... it's not. But when you walk in, everything else about the place makes you think you're going to have at least a 'good' meal. We found it mediocre at best and wishing we had ordered whatever our second choice on the menu would have been each time. 

I'm not saying we will never go back. But I am saying that we've had the \"do we really want to give it another shot?\" conversation more than once and ended up going elsewhere each time."}
{"text":"Very fun place to go for a drink or meal.  The menu is mainly sandwiches with fries, but there are good appetizers on there such as a hot pretzel, homemade hush puppies, and nachos to name a few.  The pretzel was hot, fluffy and tasted as if we were at the fair.  As for entrees there are about ten on the menu and I look forward to trying more.  

Decor is a rustic/pallet design with Mason jars and pint glasses mixed with artwork and decorative signs.  Because it's also a bar there are televisions so you can watch whatever game you want, but plenty of seating so you don't need to watch it.

Service is fantastic.  In the two times we've been there the staff were very polite and quick, not to mention comfortable with their job.  It's clear Lone Girl takes pride in their staff.

Being a brewing company, I did not check the drink menu other than choosing one of the in-house brews which was as good as the description sounded.  Kudos, Lone Girl, we will be back."}
{"text":"If 4.5 stars was an option I would have selected it.  Finally a higher end eatery in Waunakee.

Pros: Excellent beer.  Excellent nachos & fish tacos.  Fish fry is very good.  Fries are awesome.  Ambiance is excellent.  Kid friendly.

Cons: \"Smash burger\" is probably the most unappetizing name for a burger I've ever seen.  The poutine they used to have on the menu was 5 star awesome, but now it's gone..."}
{"text":"We had a party of five there at 11:45 AM for lunch. We ordered two burgers, nachos, chicken, and steak tacos. We waited for an hour and still have not received our food. One person from our party had to leave without receiving her food. When our food arrived, it was cold and must've been sitting somewhere in the kitchen. Totally unacceptable. 
It's a shame because the building itself has nice architecture and the rooftop is done well.
I would highly not recommend this place for food."}
