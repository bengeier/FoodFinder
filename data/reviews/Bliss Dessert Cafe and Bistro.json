{"text":"I was just telling my family about this place and took them yesterday for a drink and desserts. I ordered their macha tea but it was too too sweet! I asked for it to be done again but the manager refused in a very rude way. Whats more, they made me pay for it! I told them as a costumer I wasn't satisfied and I wouldn't come again but they said they didn't care. Horrible experience, honestly!"}
{"text":"Expensive and small portions. I'd really only recommend the cheesecake there and I feel they really need to work on producing some original offerings on their menu and improving their seating."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch. Had high expectations. The crepes were so-so - the crepe itself was undercooked, the egg inside was way over-cooked. And, the bathroom was dirty.  Overall, great idea, not a great experience."}
{"text":"Me and my friend went in at 11am for some brunch, we thought hey we came here once before and it wasn't so bad but this time it was terrible. We ordered our food right away since we were the only customers in the store and we already picked out what we were going order from the online menu. Let's just say 11:15 is was when we completed ordering. We got out food at 12:20. Next time we will pre-order our meal and come in an hour after we ordered. The food is fine, however little quantity for the price. The last time I came we got our food served quickly because there was more people working. But this time we can clearly see flaw in the business by having only two people working and then many other customers came in after to dine in that also started complaining about the wait on their food."}
{"text":"Came in for some ice cream. Place was packed. First no one was at the door to seat us, one waitress saw us wandering in and sent us to wait by the door. We got a lousy table facing the wall. We asked server to change when one was available. Asked server about menu items, she fumbled a little with answers not knowing how to explain. 5 minutes later, our oder came in. Not enjoying the table, I stood up and walked around only to find three empty tables. Saw the same server and told her maybe you forgot to change our table, apparently she did. Ice cream is ordinary, taste like they got from cheap ice cream bucket they got at Walmart with some cookies sprinkled on top, nothing to justify the price. I prefer to have bought Hagen Daz bucket and ate it at home. Server was nevertheless polite in communications with us . In conclusions, I am unlikely to come again."}
{"text":"Went here on a weekday afternoon and wasn't busy so seated instantly. Yet after that, all is WAITTTT. Waited for so long for the waitress to take my order, the food to come and asked for the cheque.  I ordered Black or White, looks nice but the taste was fair. Cookie n' cream ice cream just tasted like vanilla ice cream. And with such a quality, it does not deserve the pricy $."}
{"text":"I went to Spin Desserts on thanksgiving with the girlfriend, and it was actually pretty good!  The service was alright, food did take a bit of time to come out, but they were pretty understaffed for one of the few locations open on Thanksgiving Monday.   The names for their foods aren't exactly whimsical or even logical for that matter.. They seem pretty random.   The ice cream has a very mild texture compared to Demetre's - it isn't too sweet and it isn't too over-the-top. the price was about on par with Demetre's, though the quantity a little less for the dollar. The waffle was cold, but it had ice cream on it, so should I be complaining? Probably not.   Overall a pretty good experience, I'd definitely come back! They have more than just desserts on their menu"}
{"text":"Now Bliss.   Waitress was very friendly, place looks nice but the ice cream wasn't as good as other places in the city. We also tried the red velvet cake: dry (one star for the cake)."}
{"text":"Both service and food are hit or miss. Even when it's a hit, it's nothing to write home about. Spin is only really good when you need a break from Demetre's."}
{"text":"Not as good as I remember them to be.... The desert was okay... My mom got a waffle and it was over done.... And the toppings were not that great...."}
{"text":"Breakfast was not good here. I ordered strawberry pancakes and spinach/egg crêpes and both tasted really bland. The portion was also small. There are better options for breakfast elsewhere."}
{"text":"I must admit that I love the Spin franchise but the service at this location made it a miss for me.   I went with a friend on a Wednesday afternoon when it wasn't busy yet we still waited quite a while for our dessert. We were quite forgiving of the slow service considering the location is still relatively new but our waitress's \"I'm miserable and I hate working here\" attitude made our experience a rather negative one. She had made an error with our order and we shrugged it off but her lack of sincerity as a result of the mistake ruined our experience.  TLDR: Food quality wasn't bad but service was poor. I'll only be visiting the Queensway location from now on until the service improves."}
{"text":"This place is not worth the money. The icecream isn't anything special. The cake is 10.95 the smallest piece of cake and is just a cake you can purchase at Metro.    Also it took forever to get everything which I don't undestand why.. you have six staff on and maybe 12 people in the resturant. Maybe you wouldn't have to charge so much if you didn't have full staff standing around doing nothing"}
{"text":"I ordered strawberry banana Smoothies and I couldn't taste any strawberry or banana. Also, the service was terrible.  The staff there turned the music very loud. I asked one of the waitresses to turn the volume down but she ignored us and gave us the disgusted face. This place is not recommended."}
{"text":"The peanut butter chocolate milkshake tastes decent. Nothing special about it and the flavour of peanut butter was barely noticeable. The size of the milkshake was also quite small for its price of more than six dollars. Overall, the products are quite expensive for what you receive. The food and drinks came out quite quick considering the amount of people, which is about the only positive thing regarding the food and drinks.  The environment was nothing special either, other than it being decently clean, which is nothing out of the ordinary. The music was extremely loud as well, making conversation between friends almost impossible."}
{"text":"In lieu of a proper review for #175, I thought I'd paraphrase a scene from one of my favorite movies. Except, instead of Jack Rabbit Slim's, this took place at Bliss Dessert Cafe.  For the optimal reading experience, play Chuck Berry's \"You Never Can Tell\" in the background - https://youtu.be/RoDPPgWbfXY  ----  Group: Did you just order a seven-dollar shake?  Alex: Sure did.  Group: A shake? Milk and ice cream?  Alex: Uh-huh.  Group: It costs seven dollars?  Alex: Yep.  Group: You don't put bourbon in it or anything?  Waiter: Nope. (refills water for the third time in 20 minutes)  Group: Just checking.  (later)  Friends: Can I have a sip of that? I'd like to know what a seven-dollar shake tastes like.  Alex: Be my guest. You can use my straw, I don't have cooties.  Friends: Yeah, but maybe we do.  Alex: Cooties, I can handle.  Friends: Goddamn! That's a pretty damn good milk shake.  Alex: Told ya.  Friends: I don't know if it's worth seven dollars, but it's pretty damn good.  ----  One of the best shakes I've had in a long, long time. Worth checking out if you're in the City Centre area."}
{"text":"Food was decent, but the service was TERRIBLE. It took a while to get the server's attention and when we asked for a cup of water, she totally forgot about it twice.  Also, when I paid with cash, the server didn't even bother going back to the cash register to give back my change, instead, she directly asked me how much I wanted back. I found it extremely unprofessional and slightly rude and pressuring.  Servers aren't suppose to ask the customer how much money they want back, all they simply needed to do was give back my change and then I would leave a tip on the table. Horrible."}
{"text":"A little expensive for the kinds of desserts served but you get a really big portions. I love the fact that they have cakes from The Cheesecake Factory!"}
{"text":"Inside setting is nice and clean, chai tea latte is DELICIOUS. I had the peanut butter fudge cheesecake. It was very good. You can opt for ice cream or no ice cream. The owner brought me a sample of the peanut butter ice cream after I had my cheesecake. It was overall a lovely setting and indulgent dessert.  Will be returning"}
{"text":"Much like they started learning cooking and at the same time started a restaurant. Will close soon unless they learn to cook fast."}
{"text":"So we went there on Halloween with a bunch of friends. The decoration was pretty meh. But the desserts were good. The service was good. I ordered noccio affogato. It was a scoop of hazelnut ice cream  sprinkled with hazelnut and with a shot of espresso on the side. I got the decaf espresso. It was pretty good. For coffee lovers this is a must try."}
{"text":"The desserts here were not as good as I hoped. The strawberries and apple pie fillings on my crepe were more on the sour side. Perhaps it's a seasonal thing? The crepe also didn't have good texture and was not sweet enough for my taste. But the black raspberry ice cream was very good.    Service on the other hand was acceptable. Although it took awhile to grab our server's attention, she had the right attitude and took the time to answer all our questions. We even asked if we could try some of the ice cream flavours before ordering and had samples brought to our table.    I think I will give Bliss another chance someday, hopefully it will be better."}
{"text":"We went for Saturday brunch with kids. Short strawberry pancake and banana crepe was really good. Margarita mozzarella sandwich was excellent.Their eggs crepe was underestimated, I wouldn't recommended it. Not sure  If I would to go back"}
{"text":"A great dessert and coffee place close to Square One.  Best part is that it's open late by burbs standards!  We had ice cream, waffle with ice cream, and a fudge cake and of course teas and mocha beverages.   I'm coming back... Service is friendly and the desserts were great.  They also service sandwiches etc if you want real food."}
{"text":"Name has changed to Bliss.   They serve cheese cake factory cakes.  So the cake collection is really good.  Lots of options for dessert.  Service was ok.  The food was ok nothing to rave about.  Overall a good experience.  Would definitely go again.  A lot better than Demetres."}
{"text":"When a restaurant goes through management changes, you know it's not perfect.  The menus still say \"SPOT\" but with a stick on top saying Bliss.   The food is alright. Not the best I've had, but it was fine. The service was on the slower side, even though there were plenty of staff working. The distribution was way off. But our server was lovely, and she did great for a table of 6 people.   It's not bad by any means...I wouldn't mind coming back. I just didn't love it."}
{"text":"We came here as a group. Service was a bit problematic. There was issues with the bill and the waitress wasn't very patient, even when it was her fault. I sound that the offering is pretty typical, portion is as expected. The iced cream was interesting in its variety...though i wasn't a fan of their waffles. I thought the affrogato was very good. The price is not exactly cheap, but its expected from a novelty shop. I would come back once in a while, especially when I am cost conscious. Otherwise, you crazy kids should give a shot for those cutesy dates."}
{"text":"It was a late on a Friday night and it the night was a bit warm for a spring night. With both kids and the Mrs wanted to just go for coffee and or a dessert. We were a bit away from Square One and wanted to try something different. There was Demetre near by, we have been D many times, but not at the Square One location settled for Bliss.   The parking was a breeze as there are many free underground spots. The location seemed fresh and new. It was surprisingly not busy. However by the time we were leaving at 11pm, it got busy!  Ordered a Matcha Tea with Almond milk, which was really made well. The matcha flavour was just right and paired well with Almond Milk. It was not as hot as we preferred it. 4/5  A Cappuccino with Soy Milk. A bit light on espresso/coffee, but still great. Again a bit less hot than we would have liked.   The kids had a Charlie Brown which had mint ice cream, which came a close second to the all the time favourite and the amazing point notes was that the Chips pieces had bursts of mint as well and waffle topped expectations. 4/5  The last order was Sugar Sugar. Again the ice cream was the star. The brownie and cookie dough pieces were good.   Just a bit on the pricey side, otherwise a good place to hang out."}
{"text":"Very bad customer service,   will never go back and I don't recommend any one going there. Waitress requested us to pay the bill before finish the food because her shift will finish and added 15% gratuity additional to the bill without being documented in the menu."}
{"text":"I visited Bliss on a friday night after dinner, around 9pm, with friends. When we entered, the restaurant was quite empty, which we thought was strange, as it was prime time on a friday night. Nevertheless, we sat down and perused the menu, which looked and sounded promising. I ordered the Chocolate Lava Cake. I absolutely love chocolate lava cake, and I make it myself at home so I was very excited. My friends ordered the waffle with coffee ice cream and the fresh fruit crepe.   I received my lava cake first. I was not impressed. I could tell that it was not made from scratch. I think the chocolate lava cake dessert from Dairy Queen is comparable (and the ice cream Dairy Queen gives you is better too). The vanilla ice cream was served in a weird block shape which was kind of strange, and it wasn't very good.   My friends received their dishes and were also not impressed. The waffle was good, but just good. Not great.   The crepe itself was fine, but the 'fresh' fruit was mushy and browning. I know that it was 9pm, but still.   All in all, we have had much better desserts. And for the price I paid (around 15 dollars) I would rather go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came in yesterday with my brother, we were seated immediately. However, things went downhill from there. We had to wait 10 minutes for the waiter to come by and take our order, the restaurant wasn't even full. Once our order was placed we had to wait another 30 minutes before the waiter came by and told us that the table before us ordered a lot of food so the kitchen was backed up. At that point my brother and I had to leave since we were short on time and what was disappointing was the fact that the waiter didn't even apologize. Never coming back here again. I really would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Was here tonight with a friend about an hour before close so it was to be expected (though not good practice) that they weren't going to give us the best service.   The server forgot to bring my friend's water with my London Fog, but that was a minor hiccup to be forgiven. To dessert was okay, typical portion, typical pricing.   We had about ten minutes to closing when the server comes by to ask if we want anything else. When we say no and she starts to take away our dessert even though there was still some left on the plate. Did she wasn't us to order more stuff or did she wasn't us to leave? These were some mixed messages she was sending.   When the bill comes ($16 + change) we put down a twenty. Typically we would just leave that but her service was just barely average. We asked for a dollar back because a tip of $2.50 instead of $3.50 is still more than 15% of $16. When she comes back with the dollar, we get it all in SMALL CHANGE. A couple quarters but the rest were nickels and dimes. DID WE OFFEND YOU? WAS IT REALLY THAT UPSETTING TO YOU THAT WE WANTED A DOLLAR BACK?  Three stars for typical food, zero stars for unreasonably spiteful service."}
{"text":"At long last, Mississauga finally receives another mainstream dessert house.  And its' fantastic that it's located in the heart of Mississauga next to Square One.    I can only think of The Apricot Tree and Demetres as the two primary dessert places, but they are located very far and between from the thick of it all in this fair city.  (Demetres is at Courtney Park Cineplex and The Apricot Tree is way, way west end near Oakville)  Having been a regular the other Spin Dessert Cafe on Queensway, I've come to expect more of the same quality and service that I have always received.    My gf and I paid a visit to this new location a month ago one weekend evening.  It wasn't like a jam packed house or anything but we had to wait a few minutes before the hostess even noticed us. Actually, I think it was the owner that noticed us as it seems like the hostess was nowhere to be seen at first, and even the counter staff saw us but didn't say anything to her.  We really felt ignored.  Anyway, after the owner had to call out the hostess to seat us, we were brought to our tables at the back.  This location is definitely spacious and seats at least 30-40 patrons.  We really liked that the kitchen was in full view of the dining room so we can see the first hand how our desserts and food are constructed.  We settled in with a tea and coffee, sharing a crepe with mango ice cream, white chocolate shavings and tangerine slices.   The crepe once it arrived 10 minutes later, looked very pale, not the golden standard we were used to from their Queensway location.  Our waitress hadn't even noticed we did not receive any utensils. No knives, forks or spoon.  It took us 5 minutes for someone to finally notice us so we can eat our crepe.  Shouldn't it be the standard to have utensils ready for the patrons, especially if you knew beforehand they ordered a crepe?   Once we did receive our knives and forks, it was very rubbery to cut into the crepe itself. Uh oh.  Confirming our suspicions of under cooked crepe was when we bit into it and it was very chewy, and cool like it was not fresh. Despite the fact that we could see the kitchen staff making the crepe, it looked like he rushed ours to production and had it delivered it to our table.  Knowing how difficult it was to get service, and how tired we were from a long day, we chose not to flag anyone down because we knew it'd be another 10-15 minutes to get another crepe to our table.  WE jsut wanted to enjoy the evening and our company of one another, focusing on the coffee and tea with our under cooked crepe.  Oh, did I mention they did not give us enough sugar and cream with our teas and coffee?  Not the first time, not the second time, but the third time was when the waitress finally brought us enough of what we were looking for.  The first two times she came back, she only brought a couple of sugars and cream. Sigh..are they really that low in supply of sugar and cream for tea and coffee?  There were too many misses from this visit to Spin Dessert at Square One, one can only hope it is because of the inexperience of the staff and the new location.    I do hope they improve a few months from now, because I really like the first location we have frequented in the past at Queensway.  For now, we won't be back at this location anytime soon  until the service and quality of the food has improved!"}
{"text":"Horrible Experience! Do not order a waffle and ice cream or even a crepe.  The waffle is a regular size but the ice cream on top is SO SMALL!!! Way to cheap out there. I'll attach a picture to show.  The crepe...small amount of ice cream as well and as I will show in the next 2 pictures, right when I got the crepe, I took the ice cream out and it was already all melted !! So disappointing. I didn't even get a chance to have ice cream. Just cold cream soup.   It was suppose to come with hot fudge. Instead it was Caramel - which I can only notice once it was poured. So I was stuck eating it - it made it even worse and now I feel really sick from it.   I don't think I'll be coming back. If I do, maybe I'll try a sundae, after I ask how much ice cream would be included.   Being the same price as Demetres for being your own independent place.....at least provide the same portions or larger. And don't substitute Caramel for fudge when it says fudge on the menu!   Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Cute little dessert cafe in a building- I had an event in the party room and found myself desperate for some breakfast. The gentleman working the counter was very friendly, I asked if they had iced americanos on the menu which they didn't, but he was more than willing to make for me. Bonus points.   This is where my review takes a not so nice turn. They handed me my food to go (a waffle & breakfast potatoes), and off I went. Much to my dismay when I got upstairs I realized I had only been given my waffle! Because I was in such a rush I had no time to go back but was highly disappointed that I paid for an item I didn't get. They also didn't put any sugar on my waffle- not a big deal but if the menu says it comes with powered sugar on top, I expect powered sugar on top. At least the waffle tasted great."}
{"text":"Service was very slow in every aspect, from taking our orders to delivering our bills. When our orders came out from the kitchen, the server has mistaken my order with something else so I had to wait another 15 mins while they scrambled to get my food. The chipotle chicken pizza would be decent if it wasn't for all the excess flour on the bottom and the raw onions. Overall, I wouldn't go back with the slow service and over priced menu items."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday with my boyfriend. The place was really nice and small.  The server, who I assume might be the manager of the place, was really nice and sweet.   So, we order the chocolate fudge and raspberry white chocolate cheesecake (I don't remember the names too well). Along with that, we also ordered chocolate cookie dough milkshake and the apple cider drink.  It was sososos good. Compared to our demetre's trip, this one was so much faster and it was so good.  I was just a little worried that the cake might be too sweet, but they were perfect. It was so good. Also, they put in a little vanilla ice-cream with the cake, so it balanced it out perfectly.  Would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday afternoon we got there at about 2:30 pm! Place was empty. we were the first table in. and another two people came a little bit after! We ordered the Italian soda with strawberry syrup( decent) nothing spectacular I had better homemade syrup before... In terms of the order. we had  the chicken pesto crepe and vegetarian crepe with side salads. was full already so i did not have any dessert this time.     my chicken pesto was alright! bland and the crepe was not as well done it was almost undercooked but edible! would i order it again? no way!  salad? lacked dressing they are not for dinning experience and i get it but still if most of the menu is crepes and waffles at least get the cooking of those correctly!  Service was horrible. no utensils were brought we had to walk to the counter and interrupt the lady there for two sets of cutlery!   Get the staff trained/ re- trained and then i'll consider a second visit! pricewise drink and meal plus tip 20 bucks.."}
{"text":"First time coming here and it has a great atmosphere and good service and great menu so much to choose from and I tried the sundae with strawberry slices and sauce and it was so good and it's a cool place to hang out with friends and have surger suger .... :) high recommend this place !!!!!"}
{"text":"Bliss dessert cafe is a more quiet place compared to the Demetres locations that you may find. I've had their custom made crepe for $12 before tax and pricing-wise, I think it is aligned with what Demetres has to offer. The crepe batter is thinner than I like for dessert crepes. I feel that since there are ice cream components in crepes usually, the thinner the better for texture. They also serve savoury crepes (ie. ones with meat) which I feel makes more sense for thin crepes. Hence, they probably only use one set of batter for both dessert and savoury crepes.  The waitress was friendly and approachable, however though it wasn't a busy day - the staff seems to find a way to avoid customers doing their round patrols to attend to their needs. I was waiting for a staff to walk by to address my needs about 10-15 minutes staring into them as they were socializing at the cash register until I waved them over evidently. Even then, the waitress had forgot to give our table a set of cutlery to eat our dessert as well.  Overall, I would borderline give this more of a 2.5 or a 3 even, but unfortunately there are no half ratings... so a 2 would suffice for the customer service in combination with the mediocre dessert."}
{"text":"This is the worst dessert place ever, food is not bad but overly priced  compared to other dessert places but  the main reason i would never go back here is because of their service. SLOW and extremely RUDE  staff, I am not sure how they expect to get any tips with that attitude. Do not waste your time at this location!"}
{"text":"I would say its better to spend money on bestest place like café démitri on courtney park and hurontario st. no more words for bliss."}
{"text":"To be honest this was a horrible place to eat like first they made us wait about one hour to eat and then they finally ended up telling us to take our food home so my family and I left without ordering anything. Glad because we ended up getting McDonalds after witch was so much better then this place."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch on Sunday morning. I would suggest they add more savoury foods to their menu. The waitress was warm and welcoming, as was the service. We ordered a sugar coated waffle, strawberry shortcake pancakes, and a crepe filled with egg and veggies which was rather bland and tasteless. I've had the dessert here (cake and cheesecake from TheCheesecake Factory, extremely overpriced) which is what they are best at, although I don't think the cakes are prepared in house. Also the red velvet icecream crepe is decent but I wouldn't suggest anyone to purchase the savoury crepes"}
{"text":"I have to agree with the other reviews in that the service is pretty awful here. They brought me the wrong kind of ice cream. I got chocolate chip mint instead of chocolate chip cookie dough. Overpriced too. Unless you want a 10$ piece of cake & bad service, I would recommend elsewhere, a creperie or coffee shop cake is probably just as good."}
{"text":"We came here after a night out, looking for something small and sweet. We ended up first getting the mangocream, then the hazelnut crepe (can't remember what it was called), then the hot chocolate. The waitress recommended the mangocream and it was absolutely delicious. The boyfriend and I devoured it, down to the last sip. The crepe was also very well made and the ice cream was amazing. My only issue was that we asked the waitress to bring the hot chocolate a little bit after the crepe so we would have a chance to finish the crepe, but she brought them out at the same time. So by the time we finished the crepe, the hot chocolate was room temperature and we just didn't feel like having it. That, plus the slightly slow speed of service overall brings it down from 5 stars but I still definitely recommend it to anyone looking for late night dessert or even something savoury!"}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday afternoon and it wasn't busy so we were seated right away. It had a cute interior and the servers were nice. The cake I ordered was store bought and I'm not sure if ice cream was homemade. Overall, it wasn't a bad experience."}
{"text":"I believe this place was originally set to open in August of 2013 or 2014 but they kept pushing it back. Once it actually opened, I didn't really have time to try it until recently. I've been looking forward to it for a while because I've heard really great things about their Toronto location but the Mississauga location was quite a disappointment.   When we walked in, there was a sign that told us to please wait to get seated, so we stood there waiting. There were about 5 employees in the area right by the entrance and they all looked at us... but no one said a word to us. We asked this one lady if we should just seat ourselves and instead of saying anything, she just nodded. We thought maybe this one employee had trouble with English or something, but ALL the employees were like that. There were literally around 10 employees just standing around doing nothing. We had a waitress who took and brought us our orders, but she was also the waitress for every other table in the place. So just picture one employee running around doing everything while the 10 others just stand around doing nothing and staring at the diners... unbelievable.   As for their menu, they have a lot of enticing desserts and they even offer Indian (butter chicken) and Thai (pad thai) style meals. I saw that their menu had a lot of alcoholic beverages as well and I was pretty excited to try them but when we ordered, we were told that the menu is getting revamped and they currently don't offer the alcoholic drinks. In the end, we got their dessert-style nachos and two drinks. I recommend the nachos but definitely don't recommend their drinks.   Overall, I'm so disappointed with the service. While the desserts there were pretty good, the service just offsets everything. None of the employees smile--they all look like they hate their jobs, which gives this dessert place a really bad image."}
{"text":"Horrible service! When we first entered on a Friday night there were so many staffs but there was no hostess to seat anyone. There were many open tables.   Once we got our table the table was not clean. There was chocolate syrup on it. The server cleaned the table but they used a dirty cloth that smelt really bad...  This place is really gross and unsanitary....  We had half a plate of food left and they were already giving us our bill without us asking. Rude."}
{"text":"This is a very under rated spot! Where else do you find free parking, free wi-fi and good dessert? The decoration is nice and the atmosphere is cosy. Service was very hospitable and did their best to accommodate our requests! The cakes were pretty much from the cheesecake factory's collection but the ice cream is what makes them shine! Trying the black raspberry icecream with whatever you are ordering is a must"}
{"text":"As I sit here in a sugar coma, I'm finding it hard to decide how many stars to give Spin. The waitress that we initially had sucked - didn't know much about gfree (told me none of the ice creams were gluten free and then actually checked to find only the ones with gluten add-ins (cookie crumbs, cookie dough, etc) were not gfree, and never brought us the water we asked for. After our water didn't come, my husband asked the manager who was doing something on the register if we could get water. The manager took over our table at that point and he was amazing, attentive, knowledgable about gfree and polite.  The main reason we decided to try spin was because unlike demetrie's, they have gluten free crepes and waffles. I had the waffle with pb ice cream, pb cups,  banana pieces, chocolate sauce and whipped cream. I couldn't even finish half! It tasted great but do yourself a favour and share when you come here. Hubby got a waffle with salted caramel ice cream, almonds, rolo pieces, whipped cream and caramel sauce . Both were really good and the prices were pretty on par with what you see at other speciality dessert places. Gluten free was $1 extra and they used a dedicated waffle iron which was a huge plus in my books. You can never really clean a shared waffle iron to make sure there's no cross contamination.  So the not-so-great waitress deserved one star, but the manager and the food itself was definitely worth the 4 I decided on.  The place was pretty empty (three other tables occupied) but since they're pretty new, I'm sure their business will boom as more condos go up. The interior is beautifully decorated - I see lots of potential here.  Side note: they also sell speciality drinks and regular lunch/dinner foods."}
{"text":"Finally came to try this place after months of telling myself I would go but never going. It was a pleasant surprise to find it open for regular hours on Thanksgiving day.  To start, when we first arrived there was only one other family there. They had a total of 3 people working in the food prep area (I assume one was the manager) and one girl catering the tables.  Shortly after we were seated the place began filling up. As a result, service was a bit slow. In total from when we placed our order to when we received it, it was roughly 25 minutes. Now, our server was very attentive (considering she had quite a few tables to serve) and kept refilling our waters without us having to ask/die of thirst.   Because they were likely not anticipating having that many people on a holiday, I won't penalize too much for the slow service.   I ordered the Black and White waffle plate. The ice cream was quite creamy, and the quantity is a bit less than what you would get at Demetres although the price point is around the same.  I found that their ice cream flavors are a little more subtle as well, and not quite as strong as the ones you would find at Demetres.  The actual cafe inside was spacious with a good number of tables and comfy booths. All in all it was a pretty decent first time experience :) I'm still partial to my Demetres though! But to those who find the quantity you get at Demetres to be overwhelming which results in left over food, Spin Desserts may be the place for you!"}
{"text":"Just okay. I ordered the \"on the floor\" which is a crepe with pistachio icecream, chocolate, and pistachios. I asked for no chocolate but got it anyways. The crepe came cold and was more crunchy than soft and warm as expected. Also the pistachio icecream was just okay. This ran me over $15 which was not really worth the price. Nothing about this place blew me away. I could see it being an ok date night spot, but I probably  won't be back because I don't see the value for what I got. Also the service staff was kind of awkward."}
{"text":"My friend and I tried their waffles here ~$13. We got it to share since it's a big portion.   We were both hoping the waffle be crispy on the edges. But they were just simple warm soft waffles.  The coffee ice cream was delicious.  The service was good and the environment is nice for hanging out. Washroom was nicely decorated and very clean.  I think I'll probably try something else next time. Their cheesecakes look really good! :) By the way, there's free parking underground, access it through the other side of the building where you take the ramp down. It's part of the condo's parking space."}
{"text":"Never open on time. I have been there at 9am for more than 3 times, but nobody's there and the door is always closed. I feel very disappointing at this cafe. If you want to run your business, please make sure you can open your door on time."}
{"text":"Not a pleasant experience. Came here with some friends for some late night dessert. It was Friday, there was no hostess available to seat us. We had to wait 5-10 minutes before we were seated. The table we were seated at was still full of chocolate from the previous customer. They did not wipe the tables before seating the next one. They only cleaned it when we complained and the cloth they used has a really strong odour.  The place is very unorganized.  But the desserts are decent, nothing too special. Similar to Demetres.  Will not come again  Food: Ok Service: Bad Price: Ok"}
{"text":"After over a year of waiting Spin finally opened last week. I found out last night after reading a blog post by insauga. It's not quite busy yet because not everyone knows about it yet so go now.  Spin is pretty much like Demetres. The difference that I can think of is that they will be serving alcohol. Portions were large so we ordered two desserts and shared among the four of us. We ordered: red velvet cake with vanilla ice cream, the irresistible (crepe with strawberries and vanilla ice cream), latte, and an earl grey tea. We also asked for water but our server forgot and I had to remind her.  It was about $40 with tip for the four of us which isn't bad...only because we shared.  Check this place out if you want to try a different place besides Demetres."}
