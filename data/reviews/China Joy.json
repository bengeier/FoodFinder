{"text":"I've had dinner here two times and both times the staff was angry and the food was mediocre at best.  

Not sure why I would ever come back here.  Would rather go to Panda across the street for some 2000 calorie items than go here.  

Why is good chinese hard to find in Vegas?!?"}
{"text":"Cannot get much worse than this place. 

Tried it several years ago and the food was not good. 

Went back tonight hoping things had changed. Kept it simple and ordered the beef fried rice to go. How do you screw that up?

Got home and opened the box. Smelled bad right away.  Tastes bland and with a weird after taste. 

Take away lady was absolutely rude.  Walked in and the first words out of her mouth were \"What do you want?\"  I said \"A menu would be helpful to start, thank you\". 

How is it possible this place is still open with all the poor reviews.

Disgraceful.

Avoid this place at all costs.  Jade Palace off Pima is only 15 min away. Best in the Valley.

China Joy. Please go away. Forever. So a reputable establishment can open in the space you are wasting.

In Asian culture, which clearly you know absolutely nothing about, what you are doing with your nightmare in Carefree is absolutely to the people that live there. 

Shut your doors immediately!  Please for the love of God. 

Health Department, if you read this please go there and shut it down."}
{"text":"We go here about every couple of weeks. Great hot and sour soup
Friendly service. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Cozy small restaurant, good service we love the Mongolian beef and pot stickers. It doesn't have that big chain ambiance. A favorite"}
{"text":"After seeing the earlier reviews, we ordered from China Joy this evening.  I was hoping to find something similar to Golden Phoenix in NLV, as we really liked them but moved to the south side last fall. I'm thinking that we either ordered at the wrong time of day/night, or everyone else who reviewed them is insane...
The potstickers were drier than my backyard in August, and not helped by the bland dipping sauce.
The orange chicken was flavorless, not even remotely spicy, and we found a neck bone in it, of all things!
The sesame chicken tasted \"weird\", per my preteen son... Not sure what that means, but it's not favorable.
The sweet & sour chicken was passable, though the sauce was quite thin.  Didn't really matter to a three yr old, so it was fine.
The curry chicken was interesting, and not too bad.  Since I have been looking for a good curry place, as well, I think I'll probably order it again to make sure.

Overall, not a great dinner.
As my husband says, I guess we'll be ordering from the place that takes forever to deliver, because at least we know the food's okay.
*sigh*"}
{"text":"Had take out tonight for 6 people - Horrible.  Chicken was old and tough, egg drop soup was thick and just weird, and the egg rolls were heavy and tasteless.  But worse was my egg roll that was supposed to be veggie was BROWN inside.  At first I thought it was a meat egg roll so I took the first bite. Then I saw everyone else's green insides of their egg roll - GAG!!   I looked on their menu and they don't have meat egg rolls BARF!  Never never never again.  Waste of $50"}
{"text":"Very average chinese food. tastes the same as any other cookie cutter chinese food place.Plenty of food for the money but plenty of boring food is still just boring foo."}
{"text":"I've been looking for decent Chinese food near me and am glad I found this place. It's good food, certainly better than Panda X. I had chicken and snow peas. Would have liked it a little more bold in flavor but overall good. The small portion is more than enough also. I'm going to be sure to have it to go in the future since its not much of place to sit and eat.

I'm editing my review from a couple of years ago--the food is still OK, although today's KungPao shrimp was REALLY spicy, a little too much. I read somewhere about the order takers--as being less than friendly, and that still applies. The middle aged Asian lady today was just one step away from being surly and the younger lady who is here sometimes isn't much better,."}
{"text":"China Joy is a great Chinese restaurant located in a shopping center; free and easy parking.  Contrary to another reviewer, our experience was delicious and excellent quality food, fast and professional service, and what we consider reasonable prices for a nice Chinese restaurant. Some of our favorite dishes are pot stickers, garlic shrimp,  and won ton soup (very flavorful broth).  Lily and her husband are the owners; he is the chef and she runs the front.  And Lily makes a great Mai Tai!  China Joy is one of our first stops upon visiting Carefree/Cave Creek, AZ."}
{"text":"Chine Joy has decent food and is a nice neighborhood restaurant.  I prefer it to the  more commercial fare of Pei Wei.  The restaurant is \"homie\" and the service is  just fine.  ."}
{"text":"Pure garbage! the mo su pork a mess put on wrap it completeing fell apart my husband threw it in the trash I ordered pot stickers it seems they were left over from a week ago.  I was in bed sick.  This was not a good idea, they are no more chinese than I am.  And I'm down 30.00 and had to go get it.  I''m back to can soup. This place should be shut  down


I just callled to tell them and as I was complaning the woman HUNG up on me."}
{"text":"Just moved here from Chicago and decided to try this place. All I can say is it was terrible. They need some lessons from flo's.  Meal wasn't worthy for my dog. You'd figure they would learn a few good recipes vs serving garbage.

If you like awful food then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"No flavor, extra oily and to be honest I think they need to close and get a better Chinese one here.
Not recommended if you want a good meal ........good for starving and gotta eat Something now place."}
{"text":"Just thinking back on this food makes me want to vomit! The various meat was indistinguishable..is it chicken? is it pork? who cares, it's a surprise! A surprise to your stomach that will promptly try to cleanse itself from this garbage by making you vomit for 24 hours. The food here makes Panda Express seem like a Michelin 5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped taking AX, I only dine at places that take AX"}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Carefree, I must eat some vegetable egg foo yung from China Joy. Everything else I've eaten here over the years is good too but for some reason, which maybe has it's roots in my love of eggs, I just can't get enough of it. Other noteable dishes include the szechuan chicken with its light and tangy, but not too sweet sauce. As an added bonus, there are always fried wontons with sweet and sour sauce waiting for you on the table.

There was a steady stream of people getting take-out and it was pretty early when I was there last. I've done takeout and they tell you twenty minuteson the phone, but the food is always there waiting for me by the time I get there. There is prompt service when you eat in as well."}
{"text":"Eating there for years, consistently good food never had any problems with quality of meat, decent prices and i want good tasting chinese american food i go there."}
{"text":"GROSS.

The absolute only thing I liked about this place was the very polite delivery guy.

The chicken \"curry\" bowl is a small bowl of rice topped with a gross mixture of soggy vegetables, chicken that tastes like and has the texture of something someone chewed up and SPIT back out, and a blob of yellow goo that tasted like chicken broth. 

The chicken noodle soup, surprisingly, was okay.

AVOID. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING."}
{"text":"I have no problems with then n I went here for many years.  Always nice, fast delivery... And good food"}
{"text":"Great food for the price, nothing beats Golden Flower off Russel and Pecos but this place is right at the top. The Lemon Chicken is good and so if the BBQ pork fried rice. Friendly staff and you can see them cooking the food from the counter which is cool. This place is worth going to again."}
{"text":"Having been born in San Francisco and being a resident of Los Angeles, I've been a chinese food addict from the start of my life. That having been said I'd like to award China Joy my very precious WORST OF: Chinese Food award. 

We had a party of 6 who ordered the orange chicken, kung pao beef and egg foo young. 3 of us ended up vomiting up the contents of our stomachs within 15 minutes while driving down the 159.

What went wrong?

The kung pao was breaded with a coating of what felt like that green slime the nickelodeon channel used to dump on people, the pot stickers were filled with chicken jerky and the egg foo young was stretchy. Needless to say we tried a few bites and then tossed the rest while attempting to eat the sides of rice or soup. Even the hot and sour soup looked like something I'd blow out of my nose during a run in with influenza.

--- The Bottom Line: 

Bland, over starched and completely stale nightmares are served here on a daily basis. The only time I'd visit China Joy again is if I ate something poisonous and needed to get it out of my stomach."}
{"text":"China \"Joy\" was purchased from the previous owners approx. 2008 and it went from \"not bad\" to \"not so good.\"  It seems every dish floats in a sea of some sort of salty mystery spooge.  But the most memorable thing is the pissy attitude of the owner / hostess / server.  

My wife's body had forced her into a restrictive diet and there simply were things she could NOT eat.  But -- you guessed it -- stating her needs and hoping for a positive response was NOT what China Joyless is about.  It's more like \"You no like -- tough misfortune cookie! Buh-bye now!\""}
{"text":"Got take out from here last night and was happily surprised! Based on the reviews we didn't know what to expect. The lady was friendly when we went into pick up the food and more importantly the food was ready on time. The food was quite good. We got Mongolian beef, sweet and sour pork,  szechuan chicken and vegetable low mein. We liked it all! No complaints."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I don't have a smartphone yet.  If I did, I would have skipped this place and I hope you, dear reader, do too!  I was heading home and wanted McDonalds when I saw this place.  I figured \"why not?\" and went in.  The menu on the board in front of the register is not the same as the carryout menu (the carryout menu lists more options).

I ordered cream cheese wontons, sesame chicken, and chicken chow mein, adding up to $22.00, which I think is ridiculous considering the quality of the food!  Of course you can't really screw up cream cheese wontons, so let's leave them out of this...

The sesame chicken almost tastes like corndogs and I mean that in the weirdest way possible.  It's something like 90% breading and 10% chicken.  Speaking of chicken, (which I happen to remember ordering because I never order beef or pork) I'm not sure where it was in either of my entrees.  The meat-like-substance was weirdly chewy, discolored (not undercooked), and straight up weird.  Hey and I guess if you're really hurting at home one night for some Chinese food, you could just throw together spaghetti and soy sauce and call it \"chow mein.\"  Why not?  It's what they did!

If you're reading in disbelief that they *actually* used spaghetti, please believe me when I tell you that it is 100% spaghetti... And not even whole grain!!! 

Obviously, I won't be returning!"}
{"text":"We were so glad to have found a REAL Chinese restaurant close to our home in Cave Creek. Last week was our first visit and with tired kids we decided to give it a try for take out. First, the food is  outstanding! We went with the orange chicken, honey chicken and Mongolian beef.  We walked in, ordered and decided to wait in the car. 10 minutes later, the owner brought the food out to us! Great service. We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"If you are tired of franchised Chinese food that all tastes the same try this Chinese restaurant. White table clothes with hot tea and fried won tons remind me of Chinese restaurants before Pei Wei and P.F. Chang's. My boyfriend is an Asian foodie and loves this place."}
{"text":"To be honest, the food is really good, the service just ruined it for me. My friends and I used to frequent this place about 10 or so years ago, and I'm pretty sure it was under different management back then. Everyone was very nice, and the food was always hot and delicious. The last time I went however, the lady who served us (pretty sure she was the owner?) had such a BAD attitude, and I haven't been back since. It's a shame, because I used to love this place, but it's really gone downhill over the years."}
{"text":"We moved here from Boston and cannot find many good restaurants....there are some but hard to find good chinese and Italian.   Anyway,  came here for the first time because got fairly good reviews.   The hostess was nice when we firstt walked in but the lady,  i guess who is the owner, came out and took our drink order...sort of rude, but...she said the mai Tai was good, so we ordered that.  Well, it was so sweet it tasted like all grenadine! No liquor,  all syrup, so I asked if I could replace it with a wine instead.   She got very mad...insulted.  sorry!  Then the appetizers..we tried, sampler....omg, the ribs were old...i think the meat was going bad...they were very dark and had a terrible taste. Same with the egg rolls...yuk! Not fresh and greasy! I got the shrimp lobster sauce...not your typical lobster sauce but ok and my husband got the sweet sour chicken...that was ok also.   Don't think we will return anytime soon."}
{"text":"I love this place! have been going here for about 4 years! Their Cashew Chicken is amazing! They are quick and the prices are good!!!!"}
{"text":"Better then Panda express...
thats all I can say."}
{"text":"I love Chinese food and eat at different Asian restaurants quite often.  Considering the neighborhood this place is in, I paid what I would expect to pay for Chinese dinner.  I had Kung Pao Chicken and egg drop soup.  The service was great and the food was good.  I had enough left over for a full lunch tomorrow.  The atmosphere is sorta formal with white table cloths and cloth napkins.  I have had much worse Chinese food from other places.  I will go back if I have the chance."}
{"text":"The food here is always good! Spicy Kung Pao Chicken, War Won Ton soup. Hot and sour soup. Beef and broccoli, Shrimp fried rice those are some of my favorite. The owner is always nice to everyone!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went for lunch a couple of days ago. We were the first diners of the day. It smelled horrible when I walked in and we should have left then, but we stayed to eat anyway because I heard it was great food. The waitress was extremely rude when my friend accidently spilled soup on herself and stood up to let it drop to the floor rather than burning herself. But when they served us rotten chicken we got up to leave. I said my chicken was bad and she took my plate without any apology.  Before leaving she wanted us to pay $5 for the 2 cups of egg drop soup we had before they brought us our plates. She didn't even offer to refill my friend's spilled soup. I would have given the diners free lunches and been accountable.
my rating...negative stars
Outrageous!"}
{"text":"Good food , friendly helped me take to my car. Only sad part was we didn't get a fortune cookie otherwise good Chinese"}
{"text":"My family and I stayed in Vegas one night and wanted some Chinese, so our condo manager recommended China Joy.  We should have taken one look at the place and run away, but alas, we were blinded by hunger. 

Upon opening our take-out box containing the egg foo yung, my mom remarked:  \"well.... that looks..... authentic?\"  My grandma thought the foo yung looked like a huge fuzzy tarantula, and that's not far off.  The taste was okay, if you could get past the huge parts that were blackened and the other parts that were basically pure solidified grease. 

The pad Thai was the best thing we tried, and it didn't taste like \"real\" pad Thai at all.  Very tomato-ey, kind of spicy, but decent enough.  The fried rice was too sweet and the lo mein was pretty forgettable.  

Basically if you need your monthly serving of grease and oil, you should consider China Joy.  Otherwise, save yourself a cardiac arrest and go somewhere less ...Joy-like.."}
{"text":"We had chicken? Lettuce wraps and Mongolian beef today from China Joy and it was awful! The chicken lettuce wraps were not chicken but some surprise brown meat that had absolutely no taste to it at all. I was afraid the Mongolian beef might be too spicy for me but I soon learned after the first bite that not only was it not spicy but tasted like shoe leather. This place used to have great Asian food but it has fallen to the bottom of the barrel now. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Our first meal was a treat.  Not too adventuresome, we ordered Cashew chicken and Moo Shu pork.  Reasonably priced, they came with rice and there was enough to take home for a second meal.  

Based on some of the reviews we were expecting the multi-functional owner to be difficult, but she couldn't have been nicer.

The place is clean and quiet, and it even came with table cloths that were changed after each sitting.

We will be back."}
{"text":"I should have read reviews before I went here but I wanted something that was cheaper than Yummy Grill & Sushi...but I guess I should have just went there, I'm Vietnamese and of course I've had a lot of Chinese food in my time and this is one of the WORST Chinese places I've ever been to, I mean HOW can you do Chinese food wrong? Even the dirtiest of the dirtiest places in NYC are 100x better than this place, the Lo Mein noodles were disgusting...the only thing I liked was that I could order online but even when I get there, they had to question my order because I guess their website is flawed...oh well!"}
{"text":"No...  Just No.  Don't.  There are better places that are cleaner and have better food and service for the same or less money.  This is a restaurant for people that either burned off their taste buds or have given up on life.  Seriously - print the suicide prevention number on the menus."}
{"text":"Great food. Decent service. Prices are comparable to others. I have never eaten in but the dining room is clean and well kept. The house rice and house chow mein are amazing. My last order was house fried rice, house chicken chow mein, sweet and sour chicken and and order of fried wontons. Total price was about $30. 
Food is always fresh and hot. One of my favorite Chinese restaurants in town."}
{"text":"All i can say is YUCK.  Worst Chinese food I have had in Las Vegas.  Stupid rating system wouldn't let me give it NO STARS.

When we moved to Silverado Ranch, we were looking for a neighborhood place for easy weekday take out for those days when no one is in the mood to cook...  This was definitely NOT the place.

Even though I am Asian, I am not going to purport to be any sort of Chinese food snob--  but this place fell far short of even the Americanized take out chains like Panda Express, which I would eat any day of the week rather than have to eat take out from here again...

Everything we ordered ranged from fantastically unremarkable to barely edible.  Even the fried rice was greasy and bland...  I mean, how do you mess up fried rice?!

Definitely on the NOT RECOMMENDED list."}
{"text":"The older woman working there is crabby. The food is below average Chinese. We have never had Shrimp Egg Foo Young with shrimp floating in gravy. They must not make the egg patties fresh. 
Egg rolls are gross! 
I never had sweet Szechuan. Where's the heat??
Won't be going back"}
{"text":"Very good dining experience. Service was friendly and fast. The food was hot, flavorful and well seasoned."}
{"text":"Finally made it to China Joy after about a year here in North Scottsdale. The Chinese food here is a throw back to the old style Cantonese restaurants that spread all across the U.S in the 50s, 60s and 70s
We ordered the Kung pao chicken and the sweet and sour pork, both very good.
The service was good and the restaurant was clean with nice decor
All at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Pretty good chinese food.  Quick delivery, nice folks - but the language barrier can be an issue on the phone.  HUGE potstickers, really meaty.  Lo Mein is quite good.  The rest of the menu is good, but if you're looking for spicy, this place ain't it.  (Except for the hot & sour soup... that was actually very good and decently spicy.)

These folks get my business by being the closest to my home, not because they're the best of the best.  But when I'm jonesing for chinese food, these guys get the job done WAY better than the standard chain around these parts."}
{"text":"I had been going here often when I lived in N. S'dale and worked in Carefree.  The food was always excellent and there was always a nice crowd.  Sad to say, that it sure has changed, and for the worse.

Recently, I asked a friend to join me here for lunch.  I arrived early and walked in to see if she might already be there.  I told the lady that I was meeting a friend but she actually walked me outside and said that I could wait out there on the bench for her.  

My friend came up a few minutes later, and we went in.  Bad move. There were only two other people there (this was 12:15), and we were seated and ordered.  My favorite is Lemon Chicken.  Well, this was the most awful looking colored stuff that I've ever seen that was set down in front of me, but took a bite which confirmed that it was indeed terrible.  I don't know what it was.  It neither looked like or tasted like chicken, and it was dark brown.  I usually finish my plate when I eat Chinese food, but not this.  I called my friend the following day and in the conversation she said that she wound up throwing her food away as it had a very OFF smell to it. 

Sorry to say, I will not be returning to China Joy.

{"text":"Nice atmosphere, service by the owner is very unfriendly, she does not suggest anything or help in any way.  The food is fine, but everything is very greasy and extremely salty here and we ordered over five different dishes.  The pricing was a bit high for what you get, and I would go to Sesame Inn before this place which is near this place. Our group is not going back, but I think a person who is not too discerning would like this place just fine."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a few Chinese restaurants around the Vegas area and this one by far was probably one of the worst ones I had ever been to. I usually read yelp reviews but didn't do so for this location. Big mistake. It was around lunch time and I should have taken the hint that not a single person entered the establishment the entire 35 minutes I was there. I ordered the lunch special with orange chicken, chow mein and fried rice. The orange chicken was very oily and fatty and didn't really taste like the regular orange chicken I am used to having at places like panda express or other chinese restaurants. This orange chicken to be honest was simply, gross. Do yourself a favor and skip this location."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. I came here the other day and ordered curried chicken fried rice. My first bit was a piece of chicken that was either bad or not cooked all the way. It had an awful texture and was not edible at all. Instantly I had rolling stomach pains. I only ate two bites and could not get myself to eat the rest. Will not be returning. Yuck"}
{"text":"This chinese restaraunt was overly priced, had horrible service, overall bad experience. I would recommend going to PF Changs or Pei Wei for the money."}
{"text":"I have to say, I'm a bit surprised by the low rating I saw. My fiance and I stopped by this place late one night.  We always saw it as we would walk to and from the Albertson's from our house and we wanted to eat some Chinese food.  Small place. The huge menu posted on the front of the establishment is nice.  Our first time walking to this place, we took our puppy so she could get some exercise, so the menu out in front was a good perk.  Their portions size was very generous. My fiance got the tofu with eggplant in garlic sauce.  Delicious! A bit spicy but not overwhelming.  I got the sweet and sour shrimp.  Again, portion was great.  I loved that they put the sweet and sour sauce on the side. I tend to eat in small portions, but all the time, which, if the sauce was already mixed in, the shrimp would have been super soggy.  This allows me to put how much sauce I want in and keep my food longer without worry of the soggy factor.  Another plus was that they have Honey Walnut Shrimp.  Yes, you can get this at many Chinese food establishments, but seeing as how I hate driving in Las Vegas and this dish tends to be pricey, I'm glad to find a place close-by that sells it for a decent price (less than $15).  Planning on coming back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Chinese food!!! I go here all the time for lunch and dinner with the whole company! Had about everything there and all of it is incredible! Truly the best Chinese food I've ever had. The owner is incredibly nice and super accommodating! We will continue coming back forever!!!! :)"}
{"text":"CJ is within walking distance from my office. I'm sure as hell not going there for the ambiance or friendly service. It's good Chinese food. Would I travel from Tempe to eat here? No. It's like every family owned, neighborhood Chinese place---you eat, pay and get out. And enjoy your Chinese fix

I personally enjoy that the owner is also the hostess, the server, the chef, the cashier. There's something comic about it or maybe it's just that she's a bit of a character. Whatever it is, she's a \"Joy.\" China \"Joy?\""}
{"text":"Last week our family took out from China Joy.  Overall I think we all liked the food.  Some in our party were a little put off by the elevated spiciness of the hot & sour soup, but I was fine with it.  As hot & sour soups go I thought it tasted pretty good, and I consider myself an expert on the subject...  We also had an appetizer assortment which was also pretty good as well as a chow mein.

What prompted me to YELP China Joy, however, was the prodigious volume of mayonnaise on the walnut prawns.  Curiously this dish is not on the menu I'm looking at online, so either the menu is old or China Joy improvised the dish when we ordered it off-menu unbeknownst.  While maybe not one of the great mysteries of our age, here's what we know: we ordered it, we ate it and it jiggled with excessive mayonnaise. This had to have been a mistake - they can't possibly serve this dish like that on a regular basis.

Overall, the food was fine, but please tell the Chef to go light on the mayo if you order walnut prawns."}
{"text":"We took a couple hours to check out Carefree and stopped in to China Joy.  YAY!   We got there at noon.  Not busy at all, but with so many cowboy type places tlo eat, it makes sense that not so many travelers would go for Chinese .  Fast good service and good lunch specials.  The egg foo young was good, as was the egg drop soup and veggie egg roll.   It's not WOW, but worth coming to for sure!  The background music was perfect with lady gaga, cindy lauper and the rest were good pop hits.  (Not fox news nor loud country western like down the road at a place that we left before anyone bothered to even look at us.)
  Thank you China Joy!"}
{"text":"Okay, so we moved here from the Chicago area where there are some fantastic restaurants including THE best Szechuan/Hunan restaurant ever. 

Our expectations are very low here for Chinese restaurants. China Joy wasn't even bad...it was horrendous. 

Ordered out for their lunch special. I had egg foo young. How can you screw up egg foo young?  They did. Sliced chicken on top of what can best be described as a potato pancake type patty. If their was egg in there, I don't know where. No bean sprouts in it. No chicken inside it. Disgustingly bad. 

Fried rice?  Try rice with some soy sauce blended in. No peas, no carrots, no bean sprouts...not even fried. 

My wife had the Mongolian Beef which someone reviewed here as great. Really?  Zero taste. Crunchy rice noodles on the BOTTOM, so they're now soggy?  Also comes with the nondescript \"fried\" rice. 

Add \"egg rolls\" which are really bad spring rolls and China Joy managed to really ruin a lunch. 

So the search continues. We're just looking for decent Chinese food. Shouldn't be this hard to find."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to China Joy. When we got there, my daughter was having a tough day. Six of us were seated and before any orders were taken, the owner brought her a Shirley Temple. Her eyes lit up and it changed her whole demeanor.

The service was great. The food was fresh and delicious. The portions are really big, so you're definitely going to have boxes to go. We've been there several times since, and each time, the food and service have been wonderful.

Any time a business owner can sense customer's needs, especially a child, and do something to make their experience memorable, it's a huge win and the foundation for creating loyal customers. We will continue to return to China Joy."}
{"text":"This is the first time we've been here in a very long time.   The food was quite good,  with the standard Chinese fare.

Probablt would have given them a 5 were it not for the fact that the server  had ZERO personality. 

One thing was quite interesting to me.   We went here after church.   Most please are quite busy early afternoon on Sunday.   We were the only people in the place.  In the time we were here no one came in.  How do they pay the bills?  Are we missing something important?"}
{"text":"Walking out of Albertsons at 6PM after scouring the isles for those few odds and ends needed for that awesome meal that i am planning on making and...well...We noticed the glowing lights of China Joy, we both did not want to sit in an establishment tonight so we grabbed a menu and noticed that they deliver. We rolled into the driveway and decided to take advantage of the delivery option. I am all about the sesame chicken and the wife wanted to be hooked up with the honey walnut shrimp. They give you a large white rice with every entree which is a ton of rice. The sesame chicken and the honey walnut shrimp have been moved into our top 2 for delivery or take out Chinese food.  I would have given the fifth star but i have not tried anything else there....Yet."}
{"text":"Way better than local chains. Fresh prepared, efficient though brusk. Best for takeout.

Very good prices. I only mark it 4star because it is no way fancy. Delivery only until 4pm."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese delivery I have ever had.  I know I should probably write a lengthier review, but when you order a beef dish and a chicken dish and can't distinguish between the two, you know that this isn't a good place!

It was so bad I had to throw away most of the food I ordered."}
{"text":"Nice,quiet restaurant with white tablecloths and pleasant ambience. Food is good, fast, pleasant service."}
{"text":"Good Chinese can be hard to find, and China Joy barely misses the bar. We ordered two beef dishes, pepper steak and Mongolian beef, and they were indistinguishable from each other. The lettuce wraps were a bit heavy on the soy sauce and didn't come with enough lettuce. The wontons were like wontons. 

Nothing to special here, but the food was ready fast and wasn't to crazy expensive with large portions. Overall it's so-so."}
{"text":"Really good food, nice folks, quickly delivery! It is my favorite restaurant"}
{"text":"having been going here for a while. Parents use to have a house in cave creek area so this was one of our stops. The owners are very friendly and know us bye name as we use to be regulars before moving further away from the area. We have had always great experience when here. The best time to get here is right when there open they tend to get a little busy for dinner."}
{"text":"Going with your friends or family? Hold on, I recommend you search for another place. Everything on the menu, except the \"steamed vegetables\" are in a salty-sugary-glutenous sauce. Thickeners and preservatives could be detected in all of the two disappointing family meals I had here: excessive thickener in the egg drop soup, insane amounts of sugar (i suspect high fructose corn syrup) in the szechuan chicken/beef, MSG (confirmed by hostess) in the egg rolls, which she admitted were prepackaged. The kung pao was drowned in cheap soy sauce and after one bite I was thirsty for the next 24 hours. After the first meal, we complained and were offered a second meal on the house the very next day. How foolish, we tried to pick stuff that wouldn't be slathered in chemical sauces and failed. All of us had upset stomachs and gross tastes in our mouths AGAIN. This place is cheaper than the rest and for good reason. I recommend paying two dollars more per plate, but getting handmade quality food at Jade Palace down the road at Pinnacle Peak & Pima. The only reason I didn't give a one star is because I like that old-timey Chinese joint atmosphere and Lilly, the hostess, was very straightforward and fun to talk to."}
