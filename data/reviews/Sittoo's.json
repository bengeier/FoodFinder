{"text":"Amazing, amazing! So good. Really fresh, and unbelievably affordable. Incredible baba, yummy kebob sandwiches, shishtawook, there is nothing there that hasn't tasted absolutely wonderful. I can't praise this place enough."}
{"text":"Very good food. Super fast and fresh. A great alternative to the fastfood crap in this town!"}
{"text":"I used to be a big fan. The parking lot was a little hectic during rush hour but worth it. Recently though I had to stop coming because certain dishes that were marked veggie triggered my allergic reaction. Twice it happened. When I expressed this, they were not helpful."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in the area. The people are very friendly, the place is kept very clean. But what really draws me back is the fresh, healthy food thats hard to come by. The owner will let you know how he makes all his dishes and you can really tell the difference."}
