{"text":"We order from Rajdoot frequently, if is always timely and amazing food! Love this spot. Butter chicken is fantastic"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout late..10:45PM on a Thurs. nite..'it didn't take long..'just over half hour to arrive. Expensive tab, $45. for two entrees, slice of naan, tiny mango chutney n rice pudding..'they incl. rice I didn't order..The Malai Kofta Tibet is heavy and not my favorite, I do like the Eggplant Bhartha, 'not too spicy, fresh, 'just right. The rice is fine and probably necessary to soak up the juices. I ordered the Peshawari Naan & it's weird with the Christmas like fruit in it, 'wish I'd just ordered regular Naan, 'it is fresh tho, 'just one slice and I'm sure if it was the regular I'd be loving it. The rice pudding smells good and I am so full fr. just a third of the food, 'it'll have to wait for a review later. I'm fr. Vancouver originally and spoiled by places like Vij however this will do in a pinch, 'it's A-OK"}
{"text":"Big disappointment. Used to be the best Indian restaurant in town. Went with 7 friends for the Saturday buffet around 6pm. Service was dreadful although place only partially full. Wait staff were sullen and inattentive. Food on buffet ranged from okay to not recommended. Samosas were cooked to inedible. One bright spot - the naan was outstanding once we could find staff to bring it to the table. Would suggest you spend your restaurant dollars elsewhere."}
{"text":"I bought a couple groupons for this place and took my girlfriend there last night, and I was not disapointed.  We ordered lamb saag, prawn korma, saffron rice, naan, and a cheese saag type thing (I can't remember the name.)  Everything was incredible.  It was a near orgasmic experience in my mouth.  We both loved everything!  The staff was very friendly and attentive also.  I was a bit worried about the place when I was reading the reviews.  Some people have been very hard on this place, but it's my new favorite Indian restaurant.  I can't wait to go back and use my other coupon."}
{"text":"Great food. I loved it, especially the times I didn't find a piece of plastic in my pakoras."}
{"text":"had the dinner buffet! great bang 4 ur buck! lots of meat and veg option. hot or not hot food. yummy chutney.my husband was super happy full but my tummy was'nt happy with me. Still i want 2 eat there again."}
{"text":"Rajdoot has been one of my favourite East Indian restaurants in Calgary. I particularly enjoy their korma dishes. Their naan is also very good and fresh and never too greasy.  Their butter chicken is quite good as well."}
{"text":"Love the buffet! The staff is always very pleasant and the food is tasty!"}
{"text":"I must say I've had one of the worst Restaurant experiences here I ever had here.   We we're initially very excited to dine here given the fragrances often wafting down 4th street. They are also one of the few places to have an authentic tandoor oven for the naan bread, and they used to be famous for their butter chicken. USED TO being the operative word.   We decided to order off the menu and get a fresh batch as the buffet was looking a little tired. Despite being one of only three tables with warm bodies in it our food came close to an hour later and was stone cold! With none of the seductive aromatic scents that lured us into this establishment.   After we learned the naan bread was $3.5 a piece and we were stuck with an enormous bill to curb our naan fix, we vowed never to go back here. There are much better Indian restaurants within a few kilometres of this one.   As that now retired dutch guy used to say \"save your money!\""}
{"text":"went with a groupon for a dinner for four - orginally we were to be a party of four but the other two cancelled at the last minute. Didn't start well, we were seated in a back corner and despite try to attract our server for almost twenty minutes I had to physically get up and track him down. We ordered everything at once yet we were still there for two hours. Appetizers were okay, had the ground lamb skewers (not served on a stick) which were smoking spicy and the paneer pakoras, very, very bland - not like a pakora at all, although they came out late they were very hot, fresh out of the deep fryer. We then had the Rajdoot Invitation Azamani (chicken with mango, butter chicken sauce, this was pretty good, really good mango - gotta love a good mango), lamb Shai Korma Muglai (okay, not much depth to it, it does say mild but it can still be flavourful, the nuts were ground to thicken the sauce), Saag Prawn Colombo which was prawns with spinach, this was my favourite but still nothing wow, Mutter Paneer Narvana, I'm glad it wasn't called Nirvana because it wasn't. I grew a love for paneer in India and this dish is my absolute favourite, it was watery, again no depth to the sauce, rice was good, flavoured with cardamon but the naan was obviously reheated and crisy, not the way naan should be. They do put a heating element on the table to keep the food warm but the food should come out hot in the first place which it didn't, everything but the paneer appetizer came out lukewarm. Finally our server stops by (first time) after the dishes have been cleared and asks us about dessert, and, on his recommendation we chose the homemade mango icicle (yes, it was supposed to be icecream but in this case was an icicle, and of course the gulab jamun (hard to screw up, even I can make this). So... disappointing enough I asked for a refund on my second groupon. As I've said before I can do mediocre service and great food and vice versa but not both. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Went here with a large group of people on sunday and had a fantastic time!  We got the buffet, which was well stocked and everything tasted fresh and warm. The food wasn't as spicy as other places I've been to, which was actually nice. It was still spicy, but I didn't need to chug a glass of milk afterwards.   Nothing fancy, but the service was fast and very polite. I'd drop by again if I find myself in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Asked to change up the order and they cancelled it just because I asked to change it. Never getting delivery again."}
{"text":"To get an idea of my opinion of this restaurant, let me tell you a little-known fact: Against all other restaurants in Calgary, I chose this one for my birthday dinner time and time again.  Yes, really.  Their butter chicken calls to me (with a low seductive buttery voice).  It has been soo good that when I was in India I hoped to find one like IT (not the other way around). Yes, really.  There are a number of other dishes I also like here, but their Paratha bread is also a sure winner for me.  Every. Single. Time.  They make it right there in their clay oven thingy.  And it is so good.  And finally a quick word on their rose petal shake:  Its like Aphrodite singing an Indian ballad in a creamy perfect voice. But in beverage form.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for dinner for my boyfriend and I after buying a Teambuy coupon ($20 for $40 worth of food) and when we arrived, the host ignored me and spoke only to my boyfriend. Weird. We were sat with menus and waters and were ignored for the next 15 minutes while others sat after us at surrounding tables had their drink and dinner orders taken. Needless to say we left and went to the bar at Earls Tin Palace where the bartender there practically did backflips to make sure we were well looked after despite a busy Friday night. We may try Rajdoot again since we already paid $20 for the coupon. Or we may just get a refund from Teambuy. Seeing the other reviews, the Taj Mahal (my personal favorite) or the one by Safeway suggested by a fellow reviewer may be the better bet in the end."}
{"text":"Absolutly fabulous Buffett. My wife and I went here on a Saturday night and were greeted by our old friend \"Milton\" that used to own Mogul Mahal on 17th Ave and 26th Street SW. We found this encouraging as Milton made some of the best butter chicken in Calgary.  We found the food very flavorful and fresh. The rest of the staff is very friendly and accommodating.  We have been back serveral times since and we will be regulars here."}
{"text":"I find myself going back to Rajdoot all the time. The food is good but not mind blowing, their waiters grease back their hair with a little too much gusto and the prices are just okay but it all comes together when I get takeout. You can't say no to their takeout portions, which are huge in comparison to their dine in portions even though they're the same price.   Thanks Rajdoot for always making my takeout Indian date nights a tasty, belly busting good time."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner, service wasn't exactly quick or friendly but still adequate. Decided on the buffet as it was super popular. Now I do understand that it will be a bit more mass appeal kinda stuff on the buffet but this was a bit ridiculous. Tons of selection certainly can't fault them there, nice fresh naan brought to your table but the food on the buffet was just soooo bland. To the point of you would have a tough time identifying what you were eating. Just so mass appeal, everything was mild, the same flavour and it was noticeable that some of the dishes were old. That being said I may give them ago with the ala carte menu, but never again with that buffet. Again so many good Indian restaurants around, if you want a buffet don't go here."}
{"text":"Best curry joint I have been to in Calgary! Great buffet with loads of choices, dishes have loads of quality meat in them, spices are used lavishly but nothing is too hot, lots of house made traditional naan brought continuously to the table. Can see the kitchen from the buffet and can see them making the food fresh. Very clean, great service, our server was very attentive. Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Very clean. Went for the buffet and every thing seemed fresh and was super tasty. Would recommend to friends and family. I certainly plan to go back and take friends with me."}
{"text":"Not as good as some people had raced on over here. The food was just okay! Nothing to write home about & the decor was pretty lame. Sadly, I won't be returning to this Indian restaurant. There's better more authentic food I've had in Calgary. & $21.95 for buffet is a little on the higher side if you ask me."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this restaurant. The service was slow. The goat was mainly sinew and bone, and the portions were small for the price. I did not have the buffet, but this is the worst Indian food I've had in a long while."}
{"text":"The buffet at this place is just as good as any other Indian food place in Calgary. The REAL treat is when you order off the menu. At Rajdoot I ate the smoothest, creamiest, most delectable Indian curries I have ever had in my life. Normally, I'm a Thai curry guy; red coconut curry floats my boat, and I thought the Thai cook had the corner on the curry market. Rajdoot opened my eyes to a whole new world of curry. Oh, and their Butter Chicken should be made into a milkshake- I just want to drink it!"}
{"text":"I live right above this restaurant and can always smell good food whenever i pass by. Ive been here twice for the lunch buffet. The lunch buffet has authentic indian curry options. Both veg and non veg. The flavour is good. The samosas are also yummy!   Ambience is a little rustic. It is dull and need a fresh look. Love the old hindi instrumentals played in the background though.   Overall, quite happy with the place and will return.."}
{"text":"I have tried Indian food at a few places in Calgary but this is definitely my favourite. #1 is the meat quality. Their chicken and mutton is great quality. Spices hand picked, cashews fresh. They put effort into it and it comes through in the taste! Every time I've tried chicken vindaloo at other places it was terrible and rubbery chicken, or the mutton with no meat just bone and fat. Rajdoot is definitely #1.  It's family run and they import their cooks directly from India. They've had a few changes over the years and looking back at old reviews I can see when they had trouble with one guy - he was fired. They do care about food quality!  They're pretty good about spice, too. Most places don't make food spicy enough for me, so I am happy to report they will do it spicy for you if you ask. Be warned! Level 3 spicy is hot! (I usually go for level 3-5 but maximum is level 3... they can bring extra chillies for you to add if you like.) Also the takeout / delivery is good, and as someone else mentioned the portions are HUGE.  The buffet is good that's usually what I go for with lots to choose from. This place is really good for groups, parties, or catering events. They love parties  I've heard some stories of good times being had here. Damn now I'm hungry for rajdoot! Ok guess I'm eating Indian food! (This restaurant also got me hooked on the eggplant bartha so I always try to find it when I eat in other places/countries)"}
{"text":"You could not pay me to eat there again!  I went there with my fiancee and we waited over two hours for food that was at best mediocre.  Mediocre food and horrendous service might have warranted two stars but for the fact that at the end of it all, they added a ridiculous \"tax\" to the bill.  This tax amounted to something like 40% of our meal.  We came on Groupon, so we were more than willing to splurge a little, when we were first seated that is.  As the time went on and on while we sat there, starving and already committed to eating there, we got more and more upset.  Twice the waiter mixed up our meals with another table's order.  Then he brought us the meals after they were already sitting on that table for awhile.  Seriously, does anybody know any food inspectors?  I'm absolutely certain that's a major violation of food safety.  So in short, you would get better service in the middle of the Gobi desert, the food won't make you gag but might poison you, and you might have to pay an obscene amount of \"tax.\"  Only set foot in here if you are very much into masochism."}
{"text":"The service can be a little slow at time, but their food is amazing. Always fragrant, fresh and spicy. This has been one of my favorite Indian resaturates in Calgary for a long time. Their customer rewards program is very good as well - free birthday and anniversary dinners."}
{"text":"I ordered the butter chicken and eggplant bartha.  It tasted VERY different from what I had had at the same restaurant about 10 months ago.  Although the chicken in the butter chicken was fresh, the butter chicken did not have the same creamy taste.  It tasted like they had taken some canned tomato soup and heated it up with some spices and maybe a little cream.  The Bartha eggplant simply did not tast the same - and there were extra tomatoes which made it taste funny."}
{"text":"My husband is a food courier in Calgary and has delivered from here a few times always telling me how amazing it smells. About a week ago I ordered from Rajdoot for delivery and LOVED IT. Tonight, we ate in for the first time. The staff were friendly and efficient, the buffet was totally full and everything looked and smelled amazing. We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"We live around the corner from Rajdoot and eat there fairly often as a result. There is nothing innovative or transporting about it, but we have always found the staff to be mostly pleasant, the buffet well stocked, and lots of interesting vegetarian options on the buffet. For a solid, hot Indian meal that's right around the corner, Rajdoot can't be beat. Plus, they are supportive community members."}
{"text":"Where to start.  I would give this place 3-4 stars for caucasians who don't have a clue about good Indian food. But any potential Indian clients voted with their feet when we were there the one and only time. Not one Indian person was a customer. That should have told us to get out asap, but we still wanted to try it. Lots to eat, but just so blek! How some Indian establishments can put out this drek is amazing but they aren't alone in Calgary. Namskar and the one that just closed near it are also dreadful!  Don't go here for anything remotely resembling good to great Indian food! Try La Jawab in the NE and Raj Palace near Beddington Trail for some of the best in Alberta."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I was a bit lukewarm about trying out this restaurant.  My husband, son and I decided to have dinner here on a Friday night (it was half full of diners when we arrived).   We ordered mango lassis and a strawberry smoothie to go with our appetizers--fish pakoras and tandoori chicken drumsticks(which my son thought was absolutely delicious!).  The pakoras were moist and seasoned perfectly.        Our pleasant server promptly followed with a plate warmer and our entrees (and sides of Basmati rice and naan): Saag Gosht Nepali(we chose lamb), Prawn Korma Shai, Butter Chicken and Eggplant Bhartha.   The lamb nestled in spinach was very tender, the prawns were firm(I dislike soggy/limp prawns) with a creamy sauce, the butter chicken just melted in your mouth, and the eggplant was very flavorful(although I would have preferred to see larger pieces of eggplant, like Surahi does it...)              However, I was disappointed with the Basmati rice.  The two platefuls of the usual soft, fragrant rice were interspersed with hard, dry clumps.  I hope they didn't mix last week's rice with the new batch...        Overall, we had a great dining experience.  My son enjoyed watching the chef work at the tandoor(we sat at a table overlooking the glass-windowed kitchen) as well as eating the food."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Indian restaurants in the city. They have a dinner buffet every night of the week which is hard to find one because most others only offer dinner buffet on weekends. They usually have 6 vegetarian dishes and 4-6 meat dishes plus the naan, somasas and pakora. Aside from a great selection it's also one of the best tasting. Everything is ALWAYS consistently good there and I've been over a dozen times. They also have the most dessert selection I've seen and the fruit mango pudding thing (sorry I don't know the actual term) is delicious. The service is decent - they're not personable but they refill your water and take your dishes away promptly.  It's a little more expensive than some (22 dollars/person) but if you come hungry you'll get your money's worth and the quality is great."}
{"text":"The buffet was pretty mediocore and for $21 it felt a bit over priced. The butter chicken sauce was delicious but the chicken itself was overcooked. Definitely not the best East Indian food I've had in Calgary but the restaurant itself is cozy and the patio looked like it would be a great spot to hang out on a sunny day."}
{"text":"Rajdoot has been around forever, like 30 years or something like that, way before Indian food became trendy.   They use a clay oven for some of their dishes (tandoori) which is pretty authentic. Offering lunch and dinner buffets that will satisfy your Indian food cravings.   I usually enjoy the dinner buffet with a few friends. The buffet selection is always just the perfect mix of spicy with mild rice and bread. Make sure to try the rice pudding, it sounds boring, but it has the most amazing taste."}
{"text":"I do love a good Indian place and thus I was excited to try Rajdoot with a deal site coupon I found that sounded like an amazing deal.   The problems with Rajdoot:  1.  The restaurant was fairly empty for a mid week dinner time slot - 5 tables and maybe two regular takeout orders leaving - there were at least 2 people serving and a manager hovering and yet the service was so slow.   Our appetizer took 45 minutes,  our meal took an additional hour,  the dessert was faster - 20 minutes.   We had a fixed menu  and they knew what we were going to eat from the moment we walked in - why did it take so long?   We also didn't get drink refills or checked up upon in this time - which is unacceptable.  2.  I understand that some servers don't have to write down an order - but ours does and yet he didn't.   He confirmed our dessert and then delivered it to the wrong table.   The other table called him back to say they hadn't ordered them and he promptly picks them up and delivers them to our table without saying anything.  This is food that had been left with other customers for several minutes - is that not a HEALTH violation? 3.  Waiting for our bill was a painful experience but I didn't have cash to leave and walk out.  When I got my bill they were suppose to charge for tax on the voucher and then to cost of our drinks.  The bill came with  the drink charges and then a \"open food\" charge significantly higher than any voucher tax would be - it was 22% of what I paid for the voucher - and they assigned tax on top of that open food charge bringing the tax rate higher !   At this point (over 2.5 hours later...) I just wanted out - I didn't want to wait for the manager so I paid and left.   I assumed it was an accident... however I've learned they have done this to several other people as well.  tisk tisk rajdoot.  All and all the food was not bad - but by the time we ate I could have eaten the table.  I'm not used to eating my dinner so late in the evening so I was starving.  What they served was lower cost to prepare Indian food you'd find on a buffet.   I wouldn't be surprised if it were leftovers from their lunch buffet.   Still quite good.  If it weren't for other issues,  I'm almost try the place out again for a buffet.  Overall my experience was painfully slow service with a side of health violations and fraudulent charges.   Not a good combo... we will not be back.  Review 1 of 30 in Yelp's 30 Day Challenge"}
{"text":"Good service, not bad for Canadian standards.  Had the dinner buffet, would give it 3/10. The food tasted like it was made a few days back, reheated over and over again. The tandoori chicken was old and so hard to even chew. The dessert was okay, but the overall food and curries were an absolute NOT GOOD!  Overall I was very disappointed. I would not recommend this restaurant at least for the buffet."}
{"text":"As a person who grew up in an Indian community Abbotsford BC. Samosas are always an greasy indulgence. This restaurant puts them in a convention oven and drys then right out. Flavourless... 20$ for 6 flavorous dry samosas.... sucks hardcore!!!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet with casual feel.  Nice decor with some rich decorations.  Food was good quality.  Not a fancy date place but I'm definitely adding it to my list of good affordable food locations!"}
{"text":"Started with Fish Pakoras--moist and tender. For entrees, had Saag Lamb, Prawns Korma, and Eggplant, all were delicious - spicy and flavorful but not overwhelming. Basmati rice was a bit dry and lumpy. Mango lassi was slightly more tart than I'm used to. My son enjoyed it so he insisted we come back."}
{"text":"Very laid back typical Indian restaurant with instrumental old music playing in the background. Small selection of buffet in tne evening as per the charge of $21 i find it expensive. No doubt samosas and tandoori chicken was yumm but reat not convinced. Expected more choice as per the price charged. Service was griff but presume thats what you pay for buffet service."}
{"text":"My fiance & I are always on the lookout for great Indian buffet.  Our former favourite, MySore Palace, went out of business so we were on the lookout for a new one.  This is how we stumbled across Rajdoot.  Rajdoot is located on 4th Street SW, just south of 17th Avenue.  Being part Indian myself, our focus has always been on buffets as I can manage to cook up most individual dishes myself.  Rajdoot's dinner buffet is only available Sunday-Tuesday.  First off, Rajdoot would have gotten 5 stars from our experience, but the service wasn't great.  However, in their defense, this seems to be common amongst Indian restaurants during a buffet.  I can't say I've ever had great service at an Indian restaurant during a buffet.  The food at the buffet is varied, delicious and slightly more spicy than most other Indian buffets we've had.  They are also a rarity in that naan is part of the buffet and not delivered to each table individually.  This may not seem like much, but it becomes a problem when you're on your second plate and still haven't seen any naan delivered to your table.  The decor is ok, but won't be winning any awards.  For myself, it's irrelevant, as some of the greatest Indian restaurants tend to be very, very sketchy looking.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Just a review on the decor and location, as it's in a happening area for a tourist like myself.  Felt like being in India, glittery indian art, decor, and the feel too.  Nice acknowledgment when I walked in, just to grab a take out menu.  Also nice they have their own parking lot w/ a few spots, albeit it's a 1/2 block away.   next time i'm in town, would like to try them out."}
{"text":"I am afraid I wasn't very impressed with this restaurant, so unimpressed that I had even forgotten I had a meal here months ago.  In fact I only realised it when I passed the exterior the other day.  The service person was aloof and although the restaurant was empty he didn't seemed that excited to have clients.  He nonchalantly cast menus at us and casually informed us about a buffet that wasn't even prepared yet.  So we decided to share two dishes from the menu and I believe one was a spinach dish and the other a chicken curry but both dishes were so small and so tasteless, I actually have no memory of them to comment about it here.  I just remembered the huge price tag at the end, for the drinks, naan and basmati rice.  So once again to reiterate, indifferent service, small portions and heavily priced  For good Indian food downtown, please make your way to the unbelievable lower priced heavenly dishes at Mirchis, across from Safeway.  Refer to my past review."}
{"text":"The portion sizes were little less for the price compared to other indian restaurants i ate. The food was decent. Lamb & prawn Biriyani were good but the prawn/shrimp in the biriyani is so bland. They would have added boiled shrimp with the Biriyani rice just before serving. It has a pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've only checked this place out during the lunch buffet. Although I'm not a fan of travelling downtown, in my opinion it's one of the better Indian buffets in the city and worth the drive. Fairly priced and the food is always good. I remember this being my first experience of Indian cuisine so maybe that's another reason I have a soft spot for it lol."}
{"text":"We were here for an early-ish dinner on Saturday night. 5:30 or so. It was fairly empty. Parking is on 25th Ave, with assigned spots, so didn't have to pay which is always nice. The first thing we smelled when we got out of our car was DELICIOUS Indian spices = always a good sign! (I hate when you get to a restaurant and all you can smell is grease)  The restaurant is cool, airy, and clean. If not somewhat in need of an update for dècor and general repairs. The walls where we were sitting had huge gouges in them and the paper was peeling. The wall hangings and decorations are in a somewhat state of disrepair.   We had the buffet. The food was FANTASTIC. Fresh naan. Fresh curries (at least 8 varieties), homemade pickles and homemade chutneys. Very authentic cuisine. BEST Butter chicken I have ever tasted. The Goat curry(while not for everyone) was particularly delicious.  The vegetable pakoras were phenomenal. The samosas were VERY heavy (very thick heavy batter) and overcooked - almost too crispy, but just this side of overdone, so were still edible. Fresh pappadums were light, crispy and delicious. Tandoori chicken was fairly standard, although - juicier here than I've had at most places.  There were several desert options (my wife said the Gollab Jamun was fantastic!). And of course the usual yoghurt and cream type things.  Drink menu is HUGE. Nice cocktails. We didn't try the chai or Lassie (since I'm lactose intolerant, and i didn't bring enough pills with me) BUT we WILL be back.  The only things pulling this rating down were the dècor and the fact that they have a large bar area with a HUGE TV playing sports, and it seems that between the time of our arrival and the time we left there was a HUGE amount of traffic in and out to watch the game that was on, then out to smoke, then in to watch the game and out to smoke etc. etc. I'm not a fan of tv's in restaurants - but it seems that you can't avoid it in this day and age!  The food saved this place for sure! I stick to my mantra that the best food is in little (or in this case fairly large) holes in the wall.  Service was o.k. Not horrible, not super expedient, but hey - at a buffet, what do you want? Bathroom is small and cramped, only one urinal, and one proper toilet. This can be somewhat troublesome, especially when the spices kick in and you need relief! But it was clean."}
{"text":"The food was great....until my girlfriend and I got food poisoning. I contacted management and they offered a $20 voucher to come back. No thanks."}
{"text":"Lunch Buffet very ordinary. Very slow refilling empty containers. Maybe it is better earlier in the lunch rush,but  we made mistake of going approx 1pm. When paying for lunch the waiter asked me how I found the buffet and I honestly and politely said I didn't enjoy it. He asked why and I mentioned the chicken (both tandoori and butter chicken pieces) were very dry. He looked at me skeptical so I bought my plate over ( which still not not been taken off our table) and showed him the chicken I left on my plate cause it was too hard to even cut. He told me I must have got a bad piece. Hmmmm, well it was in the buffet and I got it!! No apology or offer of discount what so ever. Maybe ordering off the menu will result in better quality..... maybe I will never find out."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Got there right at 5 for piping hot delicious food. They make naan fresh for the table each time you ask, samosa was unreal and there was a spicy creamed spinach dish that I could eat daily!  Service was on spot!  Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Disappointment! And we both felt really yucky after eating their food. Butter chicken tasted like it was campbells condenced tomato soup. So not authentic! The other sauces tasted like they were possibly from a can or jar. And way to salty! The pakaras and samosas were way over cooked and hard. Not fresh!The raita had a very off taste and I love raita. The deserts were not great either. The only thing fresh tasting and good was the naan. Not worth the $24 for the dinner buffet. As well we were not asked if we wanted anything to drink other then water, and it took forever for the dishes to get cleared. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"I just came from having dinner at Rajdoot.  The food was quite good but the service was surly and slow by a little man wearing a hat, and he tried to charge me for four buffet dinners when there were clearly only three people at our table.  There was no apology whatsoever when I pointed out the error.  Moreover, the bartender has no idea how to make Singapore Slings.  The ingredients are listed correctly on Rajdoot's drink menu, but the drink that arrived at my table in no way resembled a Singapore Sling, nor did it contain the ingredients listed.  No apology again.  I think these restauranteurs need to pull themselves up sharply if they want their restaurant to continue to flourish in the present economic climate in Calgary. I will likely return but there will be no tip next time if the service does not improve."}
{"text":"You know what's a worrying sign to me about a resto these days in Calgary?  It isn't so much the odd bad review, since everyone has an off day.  It isn't that something on the menu might be sold outt or even if the place is perpetually 1/2 empty. It's how often they use discount coupon promotions.    Rajdoot had been the first indian restaurant that I visited in Calgary 9 years ago, and it was actually pretty decent.  I tend to go there probably twice a year, and in each and every visit, I see little changes in the food, the decor, things like that.  And for awhile, I did notice the food quality drop a bit, then take a sudden rebound in recent years (my guess a new cook), and then meh.    Now since January or so, I've seen Radjoot follow Wicked Chili in a similar pattern, that is, they always seem to be in one deal or another, virtually every other week.  Either it's $15 for $30, or $25 for $50 or whatever, but in the end, it started to appear like desperation to me.  You see, the way these coupons work is that the resto offers the discount, but 1/2 of that money goes to the resto and 1/2 goes to the deal provider.  Soooo... if you bought a $30 for $60 use, the resto actually gets $15 back, or a 75% cut on their sale.  Now used sparingly, it can be quite a spectacular promo.  For example, the Brasserie Kensington, one of the best restos in Calgary, has used it only ONCE in their year of existence.  Teatro, also one of the best, has only done it once throughout the 2 years that such deals has become popular.  But if you use it like the now shuttered Wicked Chili did, that is, literally have a deal every week on the week for over a year (so they were effectively selling their food at cost and losing money on every sale), well....  you're going to die a horrible death of 1000 cuts.  However, I have enjoyed the food in the past.  While not the very best of indian for Calgary (I reserve that for Namskar and Mango Shiva), it was still a great place for a nice easy dinner of some butter chicken, lamb vindaloo and awesome veggie samosas.    Last night however, could probably be described in twitter as #epicfailure.  I had walked in with a $30 for $60 groupon for a set multi-course meal dinner for 2.  It was a nice set vegetarian or meat menu.  Instead, when I showed my groupon, the waitress suddenly went from a happy grin to a look reserved for those who just killed Bambi's mom.  She then started to steer us from the set menu for 2 as in the deal, to the cheaper buffet.  Being a little taken aback, I simply thought... ok, this is the woman who will serve you and she's copping a bad attitude, I better just do the buffet and besides, most of the foods on the special table set menu was there anyways, though not freshly made of course, but I thought, what the hell... I paid for it already.  The buffet was well... acceptable.  It was running low on some items, and since I walked it around 8pm, it didn't look like it was being replenished anytime soon since the resto was 3/4 empty except for a small birthday party that had already seemed to have eaten.  The samosas was still quite good, but the nan was definately at least 1 hour or so old in the heat steamer, the tandoori chicken was getting to be quite dry, the curries were ok though nothing too particularly epic to report.  Overall, a passable meal, but if my goal was that, I really would have just ordered take out.  In the meantime, we were in a hidden corner to ensure that either no one could see us or that they didn't have to deal with us (service was barely passable at best.  )  Finally the bill, and they then hit us for the full amount of a buffet at $35 or so with a single mango juice extra ordered.  I then reminded them of the $60 dollar groupon I gave in... and they returned with the bill at $4 for the mango juice.  Let's see... $60 - $35 = $25 left... not me owing them $4.  But by this time, I really just didn't want to be there any longer, and paid the $4, a 10% tip (not a 15 or 20% for decent service... but if I really wanted to voice my displeasure, I should have left a penny.) and then walked out.  So.... Pluses: free parking, still awesome veggie samosas. Ok buffet not great.  Negatives:service and the attitude of the lady.  the overall all atmosphere (sorry, but ICirque du Soleil music really doesn't add to the atmosphere)  End Result?  I made a mistake in not following my gut reaction when I started noticing the endless deal groupons and so on and deep sixed the resto. I'm gone.  Here's a note from my lovely dining partner: she noticed that the bartender, an eldery gent, didn't deviate from the tv once during the night, and the heck with the patrons.  Great job people... really."}
{"text":"I love the Chicken Korma at this place and the fresh naan bread.  The Chicken Korma has subtle and interesting spices and the chicken is really tender.  The Mango Lasse and Chai tea are our favorite beverages.  We go all the time. My son who is vegetarian also loves it since there is a lot for him to eat too.  There is free parking in the back in a neighborhood that is getting shorter and shorter on parking stalls.    We are now regulars and have a card that gives us a discount after a few meals."}
{"text":"I had a very poor recent experience at Rajdoot.  While the staff was very friendly and helpful, however the food was a major let down.  My chicken rogan josh was seriously under seasoned, it was bland and boring.  The naan was fairly good with the right amount of chewiness.  However, the roti was miserable.  Instead of dense and unleavened it was more like a naan.  There are far better Indian restaurants in Calgary, I will not be back."}
{"text":"So I ordered food for lunch through Skip the dishes after looking at its reviews. The most horrible INDIAN food I have ever eaten. We ordered Baingan Bharta and the Bhuna chicken. The baingan bharta had a weird smell to it, nothing that would remind me of eating roasted eggplant. I just hope that I don't fall sick after eating this food. The bhuna chicken on the other hand was not a bhuna chicken, it had the gravy of a vindaloo mixed with something else. But tasted awful. I really hate restaurants when they mix something else and call it a bhuna. I ordered a bhuna and that's what I should be getting.Never ordering from this place ever again."}
{"text":"We used to love going to this restaurant. We had a hankering for some good Indian food and went there recently. What we found was watered down, reheated and repurposed food (tandoori chicken stuck in a sauce. The chicken was tough and tasteless. Only a couple of dishes in the buffet actually had meat, and in every case it tasted very old. The biggest disappointment was the food was absolutely devoid of any seasoning.  The decor is getting old and even though there are new owners they still have celebrity pictures up on the wall.  If Anthony Hopkins really ever did come back, he would permanently go on a Fava bean diet.   The washrooms were filthy and stunk. Stay away from this place, there are many excellent Indian restaurants in Calgary, this is one anymore."}
