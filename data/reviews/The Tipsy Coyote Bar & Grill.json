{"text":"Place has reopened in the old tilted kilt location. Food was mediocre at best, service was less than mediocre. This place is not ready for prime time, still doing remodeling while remaining open.  Might be better after they get their act together - but not good at this time."}
{"text":"The food was surprisingly good! Former employee bought this and about to remodel it. Friendly staff and lots of TVs. We had boneless wings and Mac n Cheese with carnitas. I can't say enough good things about it -- juicy chicken and the Mac was fantastic. Great to support a local business!"}
{"text":"Food was good,fresh, and tasty. Tried the fried pickles and zucchini definitely preferred the pickles but zucchini was good. I ordered the ribeye sliders very yummy. My husband had the burger which was huge and looked amazing. But the best part was the service so attentive without being intrusive. Only complaint would be the cigarette smoke coming inside from the patio."}
{"text":"Super fun environment and great food! Under remodeling but still open and full of tvs and pretty girls. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"This place opened one week ago in the former location of Tilted Kilt. What a dump. Lemon slice with water had a bug on it. The TVs all have plastic still on the sides. The walls and ceiling haven't been completely painted. Smokers on patio- smoke enters restaurant inside. The twenty somethings working here did nothing after I asked to close the door. Stay far away from this place."}
{"text":"This is a great place. Food is fresh and some amazing home style favorites. Place is currently being remodeled but it hasn't affected the quality. You come to a local bar like this for the food, drinks, and service, all of which are excellent. If your worried about the paint scheme come back in a few weeks. If you're looking for a great experience come now!"}
