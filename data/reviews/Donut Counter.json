{"text":"Good coffee and sandwiches. Its cute (homey is definitely the right word) and reminds me of coffee time before renovations.  

Friendly service (yay!), I'll be returning :)"}
{"text":"Love the classic feel of this place.
-Needs new furniture though 
Donuts and pastries fresh every morning 
-For tea lovers, their tea brand is the regular cheap 3 crown brand that you can buy at a grocery store."}
{"text":"If you like to connect with local people, this store is the best contact point. Decent local main stream people are very nice, same as the smiling clerk!
Coffee isn't strong but it is good for Sunday morning after drinking 1st Starbucks coffee at home."}
{"text":"Noticed this small little donut shop in the plaza after hitting up Valu Mart next door. I decided to go in to satisfy the donut craving I've been having. The inside was small, with various spots to sit and enjoy your food. As the other reviews say, there's a bit of a homey feel to it. 

They have a good selection of donuts, though smaller than what you'd find at Tim Hortons. They don't have any of what you would consider \"fancy\" donuts with outrageous amounts of nuts or cereal on top. They're average, normal donuts. I opted for the Raised Chocolate ($0.95) which is basically a chocolate dip. It was chocolatey goodness! They accept cash only which is unfortunate as I like paying with credit but the total for a donut came to $1 after taxes. I really like it when food comes to nice round amount after taxes. 

I would definitely come back to satisfy my future donut cravings!"}
{"text":"Nice little place in an area nobody knows is there.
Always kinda busy, good coffee, pretty homey neighbourhood spot"}
{"text":"They're donuts are ok. Definitely nothing special. I had the Hawaiian donut and it tastes identical to the vanilla dip donut at tim hortons."}
