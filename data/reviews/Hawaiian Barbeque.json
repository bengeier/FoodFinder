{"text":"Lived in Hawaii for many years and the good here is just like a remember. Keep in mind this is Hawaiian \"fast food\". Had all the classics and then some. Highly recommend it. Also was inexpensive and nice size portions."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed with this restaurant. The fish especially is sliced so thin its all batter, they never have brown rice every time we order they only have white rice. We ordered delivery and it takes almost an hour to get it here. The servers are friendly and nice it's too bad they can't make better quality food.  There are so many good Hawaiian food places in our area that season the food so much better I doubt if I'll be going back to this place again."}
{"text":"Food is great! close to home. Salad is very tasty.  I love love love their taro boba smoothy."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. I like it better than L&L and I'm from Hawaii lol. I love there chicken katsu and bbq mix plates are amazing. They give free drinks if your military to so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Decent food for the price, I normally get the seafood combo. Btw the macaroni salad is mostly mayo, I recommend going with something else."}
{"text":"Ordered short rib plate. Took 2 bites but the ribs were rubbery sand had a funny smell to me so I didn't eat them. The mac salad wasnt all that either. And then there was a roach inside as well. Doubt Ill be back."}
{"text":"Craving some Hawaiian food and this was the closest one to my area.  A small but very good establishment.  They have a variety of combos and choices similar to L&L.  

I had ordered the #6 combo which was your choice of two meats that came with two cups of rice and macaroni salad for less than $9. The food was surprisingly good! I decided on the chicken katsu and bbq beef.  Good portions as well. 

I had asked them about their spam masubi and they said that everything is made fresh so they didn't have any on hand which is good.  Service was fast for it being a holiday.  I also ordered a taro bubble tea and the order portion was like a venti! Mixed well and the tapioca was perfect,  not to soft or under cooked.  

I'd come back here again until another Hawaiian craving!"}
{"text":"My first time here. I ordered the kalbi ribs which had no taste to it and I could tell it's been reheated before. Gross. I won't be eating here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Food is ok. I've had better Hawaiian food. Service is super slow idk why it would take 20 min for two boba drinks. Asian owned, i don't recall seeing any actual islanders Hawaiian or other islander, and all they do in the front is chit chat in there language."}
{"text":"tried the short ribs, by far the worst short ribs ive ever had. It had no taste and it was gamey."}
{"text":"Went here last weekend- forgot to post my review saved from iphone app-

Get the banana lumpia- a desert that's soo gooey yummy like fried bananas w cinnamon wrapped in a lumpia wrapper!

Fried fish plate w tarter sauce white rice is Soo yummy

My BF says its the best macaroni salad- I'm not a crazy fan of mayo so who knows
We usually take to go but the dining room is very clean & modern- we order run into the Walmart for a few things like ice cream n cat food the bam the foods ready & we roll hope w our redbox.."}
{"text":"Its good my husband LOVES the meat platter... I love the sauce you get with the katsu chicken!! :)"}
{"text":"This place is BOMB! The meat platter was sooooo good and their rice is that great sticky rice. It took a while to get the food and it was a tad pricey to me, but when I got the food it was worth the wait and a ton of food! :) I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This Hawaiian BBQ is the best! Friendly staff and are really good with getting he food out pretty good. The Chicken Katsu is to die for! Definitely the best thing on the menu!"}
{"text":"I ordered the #3 BBQ mix and the Kalua Lau Combo. Everything tasted GREAT!!! The BBQ was juicy, tender and flavorful. I would defiantly recommend this place to friends and order here more frequently."}
{"text":"So many options to turn to.... And they are all amazing! There's a lot of options for Hawaiian BBQ in Las Vegas but this is by far the best I've had! Best BBQ chicken and beef in my opinion. Not a big curry fan but tried the chicken curry and it was amazing! I recommend calling your order in for pick up! Avoid the wait time lines and eat your meal faster :)"}
{"text":"Good food, only downside in quality being the macaroni, it sucks. The employees are super friendly, and very helpful, go in and get a Thai tea boba, you'll thank me later!"}
{"text":"Hawaiian food is my crutch. Their short ribs are amazing & if you don't try their avocado boba smoothie you're seriously missing out! The employees are always so friendly & the store is very clean and presentable. Anytime I order take out it's ready within minutes, love this place!"}
{"text":"For the NLV part of town, this is where I get my Hawaiian food fix. This place is close to where I live. Their chicken katsu is very crispy and the sauce that comes with it is very good. The bbq chicken and short ribs are pretty good too.

I do recommend calling ahead, which I almost always do. They have a smaller staff so orders can take a little longer than most places. That's really my only criticism of this location."}
{"text":"My favorite Hawaiian BBQ spot in town. When I go I always get the BBQ Chicken plate and my girlfriend gets the kalua pork plate. Both come with rice and macaroni salad. We also like to get the punch drinks. The great thing about this spot is its very fast service....And they also deliver! So now we can stay at home and order lol. I recommend this to anyone who wants to try some good Hawaiian BBQ! The Best! Dine in area kinda small.

-Joe"}
{"text":"Love the chicken katsu . Also like their fries . My girl likes their mochicko chicken . We always order \"to go\" and its always ready within 10 mins . Kalbi could be better . Too thin slices for kalbi ."}
{"text":"I ordered two of the garlic cheese fries (considering they're normally very fulfilling) and oh man! My food was SUPER greasy, I feel very very sick 
This is definitely not the same HBBQ! I feel ripped off compared to my past experiences with this place."}
{"text":"this place was fast i walked in at 9:30 and food was done less then five mins. everything was real hot and cooked well. will be coming here to get there seafood mix combo"}
{"text":"Good food and they have bobba drinks."}
{"text":"I tried their Kalua pork and the pork Lau lau. They were both very dry and salty. I was not too impressed with them. I also tried their spam musubi and I don't know what sauce they put in it but it was not good at all. If you're craving for Hawaiian food, I highly recommend going to L&L instead of this place."}
{"text":"I have been here twice so I must like it, right?

So living in North Las Vegas, aka No-Mans-Land, we do not have many options for food. This is the first and only Hawaiian restaurant I have been to so I have nothing to compare it to. 

The food is 3 stars. Not the tastiest, but its okay.
The service is 3 stars, they dont go out of their way to make sure you feel special, but they are not rude either. 
The wait...OMG the wait!!! Please order ahead of time. I will give them 2 stars."}
{"text":"Food is always good. Close to our home and it's our go-to for Hawaiian. We had an issue with our food once and the manager was very apologetic and gave us a certificate in the amount of our entire check. Everything we've tried is good, but we usually go for the BBQ chicken and Chicken katsu."}
{"text":"Always good food, Ahi poki is very good. Hot in the restaurant. Just don't feel comfortable eating in a hot place."}
{"text":"Lived in HI for 30 years so I figure, I should know local food pretty well...we ordered BBQ mixed plate, kalua pig and laulau combo, side order Kim chee, 3 malasadas and a can of Hawaiian Sun lilikoi passion canned juice. BBQ Beef, kalbi, and chicken was yummy. Not dry. Kalua pig was seasoned well (kalua pig was salty and moist so i didn't have to add shoyu) and the Laulau was yummy, too. No butterfish in it, but it's worth a try. Hard to find butterfish in the Laulau unless I'm back home in HI! Kim chee was yummy and crunchy...nice heat to it, reminds me of a bottled brand back home...maybe it's the same. Malasadas here will do. Not like back home, but better than others that I've tried here in NV. Got the custard filled and the custard reminded me of long john custard donuts back home...which i can't find in NV. Obviously, the malasadas here is not done properly, rolled all over in sugar like in HI...here, they sprinkled sugar just on the top of each malasadas...kinda funny looking :) but still hit the spot! Spent about $25, and portions are pretty good.
Military gets a free soft drink with order. Ask for a frequent card, too!"}
{"text":"Back for my third stamp. OK it's buy 9 reg and get 1 free.

They now have smoothies and thai tea w/boba.

I got the Coconut Chicken($7.75). Comes with 2 scoops of rice and 1 scoop of macaroni salad. It was good. I would have given 5 stars if it had pieces of coconut in it. I also got a Thai Tea w/Boba($3.50). It was a large, so the price is ok. The boba need to be cooked a little longer though."}
{"text":"I can't say I tried everything in their menu but so far my last 3 takeouts of Lau Lau is pretty awesome! #16 combo comes with a Generous portion of steam rice; the macaroni salad was to perfection - aldente and perfectly seasoned and laced with shredded carrots; 2 decent size Lau Lau packed with taro leaves melding with a succulent cut of pork is such a yummy surprise when you peel through the steamed Ti leaves. Hawaiian soy sauce is a plenty and I always add a side order of kimchee. The place is clean and always have a stream of people coming in. The kitchen seem always busy and hopping every time I come around. My only qualm is They seem to always forget to offer sriracha."}
{"text":"You can tell this place doesn't believe in the Hawaiian BBQ name, they don't use it when you call.  They use their franchise name #1 BBQ.  What a let down."}
{"text":"I held off on writing a review after my first visit because I really wanted to give this place a chance since it is near my house.  

Well, after my second and most recent trip here, I have to say that I cannot recommend this place to anyone nor will I ever visit this establishment again.  

My order came to just under $30 and I've listed my items below.

Hawaiian BBQ Short Ribs Plate ($7.95) - I ordered this on my first visit and again on my second visit.  It was unbelievably overcooked.  I literally only took one bite.  If you as a chef/cook know that what you have just made is overcooked - toss it and prepare a new one!  Don't serve your customers bad food!  I wound up feeding it to my dog so I guess my loss was her gain.

Chicken Katsu Plate ($7.25) - My first time ordering this item here and it was also overcooked.  Unbafrikkinlievable!

Fried Shrimp Plate ($7.95) - I'm glad to say that this was good, hence the reason for the two stars.

Spam Musabis ($2.25/each) - I would say that this is what I'm most angry about though it does not beat out the BBQ Shit Ribs Plate that I ordered.  It seems that almost all Hawaiian restaurants charge between $2.00 - $2.50 for a single spam musabi so I understand the pricing on this particular item.  But please realize that you and other restaurants like you are overcharging.  If you're going to charge this price, please offer us a decent sized slice of spam and not the paper thin slices that you gave me tonight.

My recommendation is 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate over on Craig and Revere.  I've gone there about 5-6 times now and they have yet to disappoint me, so pass on this place and go check them out instead."}
{"text":"mac salad is on point!! Huge menu. Tried the BBQ CHICKEN & chicken katsu... Good stuff... Coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Chicken lover plate was great! The plate was big and I left full which was good! The prices weren't bad at all as well. I'll definitely go back"}
{"text":"I came here the other day with my BF and I ordered the regular chicken katsu plate and he got the bbq beef. Chicken katsu was yummy. They give you big portions. BF said the bbq beef was good. He said it was more teryaki beef not bbq flavor.

Overall, plenty of food for a decent price. Will definately try again.  I love their thai tea w/ boba."}
{"text":"We used to drive down to the L&L at Centennial to get Hawaiian BBQ. Not anymore, I finally convinced Jason to try this place with me- he caved when I mentioned that they deliver. Figures that we called in an order for pick up anyway.

We ordered the usual, BBQ mixed plate and chicken Katsu. We also got a manapua and an extra macaroni salad. The queue time given was 10 minutes. I hopped in the car and when I got there the food was ready.. Awesome! 

I admit, I'm not a trusting person when it comes to to-go orders. I notoriously check my bag for all the things they forgot, but I was pleasantly surprised to see they packed everything; 2 of each dipping sauce, 2 forks, 2 knives, and napkins. 

Everything was delicious, and there seemed to be more food in the box than is served up at L&L. So we were happy to have leftovers for lunch the next day. Yummy."}
{"text":"Average CHINESE restaurant. There was nothing Hawaiian about it. I was hoping for some kind of pineapple but there wasn't any"}
{"text":"So I went to this place  and I order my food and there very slow and disrespectful. There was a group of 4 and a lady  behind me and got their  food before me this shit is pissing me off right now now I got my food and the shit is garbage.. FAKE ASS L&L"}
{"text":"New to this side of N. Vegas,so when my step daughter suggested this place we decided to give it a try.Surprisingly it was good.The service was very friendly and quick,the food was fresh.They give large portions and the price is fair.You have a choice to either eat in or take to go.The best part is that they deliver.Will definitely be coming back here"}
{"text":"This Hawaiian food is great! The Chicken Katsu and BBQ Mix Plate are my favorite. Fast and Friendly service, food is very consistent."}
{"text":"I checked out this place last night. I ordered the kalua pork with cabbage, chicken cutlet, spam and chicken musubi, and garlic chicken plates. The musubi tasted good but had way too much rice. The kalua pork was just 'okay' with the fake strong smoke flavor. The garlic chicken was fried round chicken pieces mixed with the bottled sweet chili sauce, not good. The best dish was the chicken cutlet. It was crispy and the gravy was light. I did not care for their macaroni salad. it was mushy and too much mayo. Less one star for dirty condiments at the table. The Sriracha bottles had caked on black sauce on the tips...yuck!!"}
{"text":"Chicken Katsu is where it's at! I'm Central American, Belizean, I have MANY Polynesia friends and the first place they took me was L&L Hawaiian BBQ. Nothing like this place! 
I love the Chicken Katsu Masubi too!! 
My girlfriend love the Boba Drinks to :) 
Great place, good food. Mahalo"}
{"text":"Amazing mango bubble tea and seafood and meat combo. We stopped in late one evening while visiting Vegas and we were glad we did. All our food was good and very worth the price."}
{"text":"Always have a few people in here and the food is pretty typical.  Quick stop for an average lunch.  Kalua pork has good flavor, curry is too blah but their crab rangoon is always good."}
{"text":"great place for a quick Island fix!  Comparable prices and nice greeting."}
{"text":"This place was ok, reminded me of L&L from the menu items but lower quality. I'm pretty sure the owners aren't from Hawaii either. I had a BBQ mix plate which came with chicken, beef and short ribs. The meat was tasteless and under marinated/seasoned and I had to use the provided sauce which I usually don't use. The beef and ribs were slightly overcooked but not too bad, just made it more chewy. Not sure if I just ordered the wrong thing because I read a bunch of good reviews. Might have to come back and try other items to see if maybe just the BBQ is off."}
{"text":"Ordered garlic chicken platter and it was not appetizing.  The chicken was over cooked and t be honest most likely left overs and refried.  I would recommend going to an authentic Hawaiian joint vice one owned by Hawaiians.  Gross overall."}
{"text":"DELICIOSO!!!!!! This place is quick, friendly, cheap, FUCKING GOOOOOOD!!!!
Why am i only giving it 4 stars if its soooo good. psh duh cus I've only had the food here twice 1.Sea food combo plate (delicious btw shrimp,fish, rice, mc salad)
2. Musubi, perfect not greasy or soggy rice perfection in every bite.
I will most deff update my review when i get to try more dishes, how can you review a restaurant when you only eaten there once or in my case twice actually!?!?!?!?!/
Any who super nice friendly service, delicious food! 

******OH YA!!!! military peeps you get a free beverage if your active duty!!! don't quote me on that but I did and that's what the cashier told me when she saw my ID. in my wallet so FYI just ask"}
{"text":"When it comes to hawaiin I would say this place is better then average with a pretty robust selection overall. I swear they have like a hundred of sheets of papers up listing off menu items. I definitely have to hand it to them when it comes to the mac salad, very tasty. Only downside is the price is a tad high in my opinion, but not breaking the bank by any standards."}
{"text":"Always serves fresh amazing food for a great price! I come here at least twice every week. I might be addicted."}
{"text":"We have tried this place several times and it has never gotten better. I've had their teriyaki chicken... Chicken was fatty. Taro smoothie with boba--no flavor to either. & most recently I've had their thai tea with boba. The tea had a very funny smell and the boba was overly chewy with no flavor. I will not return."}
{"text":"If your in this part of town, your choices are limited and tis is better than a lot of places over there. I got a mixed plate and it was decent but nothing to get overly excited over."}
{"text":"It's Hawaiian bbq, what's not to love! 

The service here is very nice and friendly! Food always hot and fresh, except for the kaluah pork before closing. Tends to be a little dry late night but that's understandable.

Our favorite Hawaiian spot to date."}
{"text":"FOOD: All good so far. Comes with rice and pasta salad for the most part. They have daily specials (handwritten signs by the register).

SERVICE: Always quick, always pleasant.

AMBIANCE: Seating is limited. if you have a big group, be there before 12:00."}
{"text":"Love this place! When me and my wife went the other day, we couldnt make up our mind on what to order because not only do they have your basic menu, but they also have a boatload of specials that is not on their basic take home menu. 

So we decided to get the seafood mix and and bbq beef mix. I also ordered the pineapple fried rice (yes, I said pineapple fried rice!). We ordered it to go so while we were waiting, I noticed several people come in and order the ube (taro) smoothies. I guess it must be that good if people come in there just to order that! In the midst of this, the lady that took our order told us that they messed up the pineapple fried rice. She apologized and offered us free drinks for our inconvenience. I must say that I was impressed with her forwardness and honesty. So we had to wait another couple of minutes but I didnt mind cuz we were compensated accordingly.

Now their food is self explanatory. Doesnt matter what you order. Whether its chicken, beef, or fish, everything is good! Portions are big especially when you order the regular size. The macaroni salad is very tasty.

Their location is quite cozy so if you come with a big party and plan on eating there, good luck! Driving on Losee, if you dont really look for their sign, you will pass them for sure."}
{"text":"The taste of the food was ok but I wasn't even finished eating and started to feel sick.  I got the chicken katsu plate. Just left there maybe 15 minutes ago and as soon as I get to a bathroom I will be puking. No good."}
{"text":"Terrible! How can you mess up Kalbi?? Rubbery, greasy and not enough flavor... Needed to be cooked longer or something... Yucky!!! Charged $1/scoop of brown rice..."}
{"text":"3.5 
If you are looking for affordability, incredibly large portions, and great service, this is your place. You probably have to try this place on your own to decide if you like it. I grew up on a tropical island, and this isn't quite as Hawaiian in taste as I was expecting it to be, but the lady waiting for her to-go order absolutely adores this place though, so something different for everyone.

Had the mixed barbecue plate, which has a bunch of different meats on it. Like, 4, I think. Some of the meat glazes were more Chinese-flavored than Hawaiian flavored, and I don't think the meats were actually grilled and were just cooked on a flattop. 

I'd probably give this place about a 3 (not bad at all, just not anything I'd crave) for food since it was a little too greasy and fatty, but the service is just so unbelievably sweet and friendly that you can't help but be happy that you are supporting a small business. 

Parking is ample, and they take credit cards.

Not a bad place for a quick fix if you are on the north side, but I'd probably check out a few of the places around Craig St also if up on that side of town."}
{"text":"Never had \"Hawaiian BBQ\" before I lived in Vegas, therefore I can't speak of the authenticity here. They have dishes with spam, if that counts for anything. This location was my usual go-to if I was in the mood for macaroni salad and fried food. The \"Hawaiian\" mac salad is heavy on the mayo, but seriously good. My favorite dishes here are the chicken katsu and  the seafood combo, which includes mahi mahi, scallops, and shrimp.  Get the katsu sauce for dipping, as it's really good on everything. The service here is very friendly, and the food is prepared fast and is always consistent in quality. They added \"healthy\" plates at some point, and the shrimp is very good with a nice salad, but if you're not a fan of garlic, beware. Very garlicky! Great spot for takeout (really great if you're hungover)."}
{"text":"I have order about have the menu. This place is very good. The chicken katsu and the misubi is delicious. I did order the orange chicken and the only critique is not to use to much garlic it orange chicken after all not garlic chicken and the garlic does need to be cooked so it doesn't over power the dish. And the lumpia needs to be fried with very hot oil so it doesn't come out to greasy/oily."}
{"text":"Food is good, nice family owned place, and I love that they have a TV!
The prices are decent and I like their specials.. Free or included stuff is a plus!"}
{"text":"I had came in here with my wife and my son. We order 5 spam musubi's, a medium low carb plate, a small garlic fries, and a seaweed salad. 5 people walked in after us and they all got there food before us. This is bullshit. I'm never coming here again."}
{"text":"Pretty good service for mediocre food. Quiet and comfy booths in the restaurant. Beverages need more flavor."}
{"text":"I called to order chicken pineapple and fried noodles my first time . I was so happy because they finally have one close to my house and my husbands favorite was chicken pineapple so I went order it but when I get home and we sat down together my husband and in the table to eat. The foods looks terrible!!they look as if was just left over that they put it mix together and warm it in microwave and taste horrible never again will I go there my first and last I won't recommend anyone to eat there is embarrassing."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite hawaiian places near me.  The food is consistantly prepared and presented well.  Lines are also short."}
{"text":"Drive the extra five or so minutes to 808 Mixed Plate for remarkably better food.

Garlic Chicken ordered here was just covered in sweet & sour sauce and tasted like rocks. Do you know what rocks taste like? Neither did I! Until now~

Kalbi Short Ribs were decent-ish?? But again remarkably better at 808. Really is a night and day difference."}
{"text":"A little gem right by my daughters school :-)
The food/skinny
I usually get the kalua pork plate no cabbage (#16) and it is good not great (comparing to Hawaii pork which I shouldn't) it is a lot better than L & L I will say the Mac salad is always on point cold and delicious. We just tried the garlic cheese fries for the first time and omg I wish we ordered the large and not the mini they were beyond delicious very garlicky and lots and lots of cheese. My girlfriend usually orders the shrimp burger and Mac salad and she loves it. I also love the fact that the menu is so big and has lots of options I always leave full, the girl that works the front is always very nice and sweet she never messes up our order. 
The bad 
The location is sometimes a bit of a drive they should open a few more places as this good is great. 
This place is a gem and all the people who live or work in north Las Vegas should check this place out."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch recommended by my coworkers.  Didn't eat diner the night before due to a long day so I brought my appetite.  Got the Korean style short ribs and they hit the spot.  Came with white rice and macaroni salad.  Price was under $10 with a drink.  Love island and Asian food. Will came back again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The mahi mahi here was really good and you get a lot ! It was served on a pile of white rice with lemon wedges. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Grate place grate food 
There costumers service is grate
I recommend this place to anyone who loves Hwahii food.............................."}
{"text":"The Saimin with spam was very good. The katsu chicken was crispy and delicious. The service was fast and friendly. Will come back again."}
{"text":"My husband really likes their Kalbi Short Ribs along with mac salad of which he always requests 2 salads. I love the Chicken Katsu. Crisp and crunchy; cooked perfectly and served with katsu sauce. They have huge selection of local kine food. We typically call in the order because they can busy and wait could be up to 20 mins depending on if they are busy. If I have to wait, because I am picking up on my way home from work, they will give me cup free of charge to get a drink while I wait. The staff is friendly. The restaurant has booth and table and chairs along with a TV if you decide to eat there. Their almond cookies are yummy and are tempting at the register. I obviously have given in before. :) Yum!"}
{"text":"Pork was dry, donuts had no sugar and were soggy, shrimp were good, they forgot poke on delivery but it was spicy and warm."}
{"text":"This place was very good. My family and I ordered one of the family meals and it was so much food. The different styled chicken were amazing, moist, and crunchy. The Mac salad as always flavorful. Rice, perfectly steamed and didn't have any crunchy bits. The people who I asked for delivery were a little difficult to listen to but that's my only complaint."}
{"text":"Lately I have been neglecting yelp and Hawaiian BBQ.  Now seems like a good time to stop neglecting both.  

Aloha we have free wifi here.

I don't think the location of this place is very great.  I barely noticed it when I drove by and had a hard time telling if it was open yet or not.  It's also right next door to a gym that nobody goes to.  

Other than that I think the prices and food are pretty great, especially with the size of the servings.  You can get a mini order for around $5.55 and a regular sized for $7ish depending on what you get.  The mini size is pretty nice and filling on it's own.  Regular is nearly double (or maybe more) the food.  Speaking of more food the spam masubi here is massive.

I guess they ran out of ideas on how to decorate the place because on one wall they have shirts the employees wear and they sell them.  That's pretty funny to me.

The staff here is nice but they never gave me a card to get stamps.  They have a nice tv in here but it's always on CNN, so the 2 times I've gone here I ordered to go because the news would bore and depress me.

I like the food here a lot and would definitely recommend this place.

The end."}
{"text":"Good, average food. Not the greatest but it hits the spot. 808 Hawaii Mixed Plate up the road has some fancier dishes, a little more tasty, but you get what you expect here."}
{"text":"This is your prototypical Hawaiian BBQ joint. It's very reminiscent of L&L's. In fact, they even have the daily specials laminated and taped behind the counter. The serving sizes are pretty much the same as well with your choice of mini or regular. The chicken katsu curry was good as was their macaroni salad. I thought the spam musubi was smaller in size. The food was good, but nothing about this place made it stand out from any other Hawaiian barbeque place."}
{"text":"Bad customer service, got my order wrong and it was my first time there. I don't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Spam...ok
Chicken...very good
Beef...very thin, tends to be inconsistent on flavor.
Mahi Mahi... Today it was horrible
Rice...good
Macaroni salad... Good

And that folks was my BBQ Mix plate today.."}
{"text":"Still a fan, especially since they deliver.

Recent Additions:
-Loco Moco w/Brown Rice:  Double patties with scrambled eggs.  Pretty good.  My favorite is from Cheeseburger (PH).  Still hits the spot. 
-Fried Mahi Mahi:  Just okay.  Ordered recently because I needed to add more fish to my diet.  A fishy fish if you know what I mean, but not bad at all.

My favorites here is still their Katsu and Spam Masubi.  My opinion, better than most."}
{"text":"MENU is very similar to L&L. The fact that it's close to Aliante helps since there isn't much food around this area. Their portion is pretty  big and the price is good, so that's also a plus for me. Favorite items are the mochiko chicken and the kalua pork.  Oh and let's not forget the garlic cheese fries !  :)"}
{"text":"During my pregnancy this is all I wanted...delivered. They were pretty quik and didn't have to wait long. If there was a longer wait than usual they would always tell me ahead of time. Chicken katsu and Kalua pork remain my all time fav, tai tea delicious and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Since Moving to the North Part of Las Vegas, I have noticed that there are not too many places to eat in the area. But, while Driving around just to see what was around my sister's area I found Hawaiian BBQ. 

This little eatery is located on North Losee Road where you will find Walmart Neighborhood Market, Terrible's Gas Station and some other Eateries, and Businesses. It is next to Anytime Fitness.

The Eatery itself is a little small, so I would suggest take out. There is a TV for you to watch while eating, and the restrooms are located in the back. 

They do have a menu above, or behind the counter with pictures to give you an idea of what your food may look like, for those of you who don't know what Kalua Pork, or LauLau look like. I come here on occasion, and I usually get a Spam Musubi, or Chicken Katsu, or the Mahi Plate. The Taste is okay, at times a little salty, or they put a little too much teriyaki sauce in the spam musubi, making it a bit saltier. But for the Price it is Pretty OK.

**I Honestly wouldn't Call All of the Items on the Menu Hawaiian, Some are Japanese, and American.

They do serve Thai Tea, and Boba Drinks also, Their menu for those are also located at the Ordering Counter. 

The Customer Service is Very Good, if you don't know what a certain food is, he/she will explain it to you as best they can. 

**Just be cautious of the catering aspect of it, My sister ordered the Teriyaki Beef on one occasion, and we found that there was only a thin layer of the Teri Beef, and it was sitting on a large bed of shredded cabbage. And, just recently we ordered the Mahi and....The Same Thing Happened. a Thin layer of Mahi, laying on a Very Large Bed of Shredded Cabbage."}
{"text":"Food is a 3, but a 4 star for their responsiveness to my complaint.  their malasadas are microwaved.  first two were stone hard when I got around to eat them, second two were soggy and served to me steaming hot - not good.  
they promptly refunded my money, on the spot.   So, order anything else, and it's served up promptly  - but keep away from the malasadas until they figure out how to fry/bake them."}
{"text":"Good food and decent prices.
Close to home and best spot to go when having those hawaiian/korean food cravings."}
{"text":"I love this place with all my hearts. They are mouthwatering, amazing, heavenly, good quick service, have I mentioned delicious? 

At first I was worried I wasn't going to like it. Sometimes I can be picky and closed minded. I often order wrong the first time with a new cuisine. Nope! Short ribs, rice, the only macaroni salad I have ever liked to eat. 

They answer the fone quickly, they don't deal with pleasantries. You order what you want. In our case, boyfriend has ordered enough times that they have memorized the address. (if that says anything about the deliciousness.) our food arrives promptly, still hot. And I'm pretty sure I don't breathe between bites or ribs. I forgo the fork they supply for my fingers because, at this point, they're already covered in amazing and it's pointless... Haha... A pointless fork. That's a spoon. 

I can only hope they exist in my new city. But if not, this is one of the first places I'm coming back to when I visit home."}
{"text":"The whole family loves this place, if you haven't tried it, the staff will make recommendations.  They are always friendly and quick.  We call ahead our orders on the way home from work.  Try the kahula pork or the lau lau with rooster sauce. Soooooo yummy!  Picky eaters would probably like the chicken katsu, also very good!"}
{"text":"I'm going to be a big critic because I used to work at L&L and lived by the original L&L, long before the franchise made it to the \"mainland\".

This is not L&L, but is very similar to it.  The menu is almost identical, so you can expect the same type of menu.  I read in other reviews that they are prob not from Hawaii, which they may not be, but food is pretty good.  Here is the secret when you want to eat at these Hawaiian BBQ places for your plate lunch, look for the Chinese cook!  I'm only referring to when you want to eat katsu or bbq items, not Hawaiian food (Lau Lau, etc).

This place is located by Anytime fitness and a very under developed shopping center.  They do have menu items that will cater to you protein addicts.  I ordered the garlic ahi plate, grilled.  It is breaded fish, but not panko style.  They were out of Brown rice so I got all vegetables, which turns out to be a house salad.  Iceberg lettuce, tomato, red cabbage, carrots, boiled egg, & cucumbers, BUT served with ranch sauce.  I like dressing that is clear.

The plate was pretty much delicious, but for a regular size plate, I expected to see three pieces of mahi for a regular size plate.  Cost was $10, and I know I get three larger pieces at the L&Ls around Las Vegas (& Hawaii).  That's my gripe, I got jipped a piece for what I paid for.  

Service was alright, they seem to have their burst of customers, looks like they deliver, that's a plus for purple who live around here.  Worth a shot to try of this is your hood and you ate trying to meet your plate lunch crave."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but first of all I walk in and simply ask the Asian lady at the counter do u wash your cabbage well before chopping it for the food. I'm pregnant and have to be careful with washed produce. She gave me a total attitude saying she doesn't know so I told her we'll can u please go ask? She huffed and went to the back and asked. I ordered the BBQ chicken it looks nothing like the menu pic as in the pic it looked like chicken with BBQ sauce it wasn't. It was nasty over-processed dark meat chicken way too salty. Gross I ate one bite spit it out this place is gross. The rice was ok I ate it all I was so hungry. Truly disappointed. Didn't even want to ask for something else might get more attitude from the lady."}
{"text":"Needed some quick yummy food to take home and feed 9 people... especially with chicken.  This place popped up and the pictures looked good. Though they have a catering/family option I opted for 8 different meals because I wanted to try a variety of food :)  everything was delicious, from the chicken to the pork to the seafood to the spam!  not sure when I'll be in the area again but I'd eat here again.  Very delicious, friendly and the big order came out freshly cooked yet prompt."}
{"text":"This is great.  The service is awesome.  The portions are large.  The price is right.  You can't get any better than that.  It is family owned and operated.  They remember their customers.  This place easily beats on the competition such as Aloha and LL.  They are in an odd location but it is easy to see the big neon sign that says OPEN.  And the TV is not always on CNN.  I have watched basketball several times in there.  If you haven't tried it, get to #1 Hawaiian BBQ now."}
{"text":"Good food at a very good price.  I am looking forward at ordering some the katsu curry next.  The chix katsu and the spam masubi was great.  The only problem was location marked on yelp.  The actual address was different from the actual location marked on yelp.   Other than that issue, we will be back for more."}
{"text":"Hawaiian barbecue has a lot of choices, and depending on what you're looking for they have. and reasonably priced. 

I like to buy the low-carb meals they have, my favorite is a medium low-carb meal with two eggs over easy. The price is $9.25, not a bad deal especially when you're trying to eat healthy.

The one thing I do like about this place is that they have so many choices to choose from, and if you looking for a healthy meal or not so healthy meal they have it.

This might not be the best barbecue I've ever had, but it's not the worst either. It's a good meal, at a good price."}
{"text":"We tried the BBQ chicken plate, Portuguese sausage loco moco and egg rolls. The loco moco wasn't so loco since they forgot to give us the gravy (take-out)... Chicken was tasty and so were the egg rolls. The egg rolls are greasy though so beware if you are not into greasy egg rolls."}
{"text":"5 stars for customer service and consistently great food. I came in one day for a couple of musubis to go and they accidentally forgot my order. I had to leave in a rush and she felt so bad, told me to come back another time and remind her. Well here I am, and she remembered- discounted my dinner and gave us some free crab rangoons! We have been coming to this particular establishment for years now and that won't change any time soon. It's always clean, they usually have sports playing on their TV and have a great selection on the menu to choose from. If you let them know about your food allergies, they are very respectful of them! Thank you to the staff again. See you next time!"}
{"text":"First and Last time!!! I just got food delivered and it was terrible. I found a big black hair in my chicken, I'm a blonde so definately not mine. The ribs were mostly fatty, and the curry sauce was nasty. So disappointing"}
{"text":"If you've had some authentic Island food, and can't live without it, this isn't the place for you.  I would categorize this eating venue as the \"fast food\" chain version of Hawaiin food.  They're all really nice and provide fast service... why 4 stars then?  The food is standard like all other Hawaiin BBQ joints in town (3 stars) but the malasadas (Portuguese fried donuts) there are the closest you can get that compares to Leonard's in Oahu which puts them at a 4.  For those of you who don't know what malasadas are... happy dining on your new discovery!  

They have plain ones for $1.59 each, and custard filled ones for $1.79 each.  

Gonna gain at least 10 LBs before the month's over!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome. The Yelp reviews and photos helped big time in choosing from the menu. The atmosphere is casual and friendly. The staff are helpful and patient. I ordered the BBQ Mixed Plate which was loaded with delicious BBQ meat and rice. This was enough for two! The garlic cheese fries were okay, just a tad bit greasy. The Chicken Katsu was awesome, we'll priced, and huge. I also recommend the ordering from the soup menu. I love this restaurant and can't wait to try something new each time. But I end up ordering the BBQ Mixed Plate.

Note: There are two Yelp postings for the same business. This was my review."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner and decided to try this place after a year! It is delish! I had the spam, eggs, rice, and macaroni plate...portions are a-plenty, food is awesome, prices are great, and service was fast! I'm going back today!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of when I lived in Hawaii. Typical HI menu and they have spam musubi and manapuas. Service was fri madly but a bit overwhelmed. Eating area is not large but it was clean and orderly. Food was solid Hawaii. Good taste and portions. If you've ever had Hawaii local food you'll appreciate this place."}
{"text":"The service here is fairly slow, but the dish I ordered is pretty darn tasty. 

I ordered a \"mini\" (which is large enough for one fairly hungry person) of the chicken katsu curry.  It's not bad at all.  The prices are rather reasonable to boot.  The wait time to get my meal, however, leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"It's a small place so it gets packed rather quickly.  The food is good and there's quite a variety.  I must say they have better food than Zippy's in Hawaii.  I like their spam musubi, loco moco, chicken katsu, kalbi and boba tea.

They deliver too!"}
{"text":"Serving is big, pricing is reasonable however I tried something new this time. The \"roast pork loco moco\". It was ridiculously salty. I pretty much just ate the eggs , mac salad and rice . Blah"}
{"text":"Food is really good. Service is really good. Come here once a week at least. My favorite is the katsup chicken.  The girl at the cashier is super nice, but they all are."}
{"text":"Ono kine grinds!!!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place was good, the employees, the menu, the food. I've tried other Spam Musubis around the area, best ones in my opinion are at this place. I've tried the chicken and steak from other Hawaiian food chains as well, nothing compared to these guys, there's a reason there #1"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly. I order the pineapple fried rice with beef. I did not like it at all..the pineapples were dry and did not have any flavor. I had to do a scavenger hunt to find the couple of pieces of beef. The beef did not have much flavor either. Highly disappointed."}
{"text":"With 808 Hawaiian Mixed Plate not too far away....this place just doesn't cut it for me.  I ordered the \"garlic chicken\"....no garlic...just sweet and sour chicken?! Very misleading description.  Coworker orders Portuguese sausage/eggs/rice...what can go wrong, right?!  Um...the box opens and I ask did you order corn beef hash....it is some strange dried spam patty looking thing...no bueno.   They should probably just call this place China Barbecue, because there isn't anything Hawaiian that I can spot.  We also tried the ahi tuna poke...I will give them credit for having fresh fish, even if the marinade wasn't amazing."}
{"text":"Hawaiian BBQ is my favorite Hawaiian place in North Vegas. The thing that makes them just a step higher than 808 mixed plate is that they have fried rice and they deliver. They will even deliver to the Airforce base. The food is always good and I have never had bad service. The short ribs are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Same concept you'd expect at L&L and even in Hawaii. Customer service is pretty consistent, and I like that the keep their dining area clean. We usually enjoy our eats, except for the one time I waited 40mins for my beef curry only to have a semi-cooked potatoe and carrot and pieces of meat that were absolutely so hard I was disgusted and pissed. Hubs was on his lunchbreak and I didn't have the time to gripe or wait for a new meal. 

Since we have been frequenting this spot since their birth, I'm fully aware that for the most part...they're good. Exceeeept for that one time...hahahhaha! Which is pretty good, aye. 
 
It's true. On our end of NLV, there isn't much food options in comparison to the other parts of the valley which is why I think they're worthy of 4 stars. It's a solid option for us if we want to save a drive for our island fix. They're reasonably priced plate lunches so I cant complain. 

It isn't too big in there so if it's busy, skip the stroller. I learned long time ago to just carry the sleeping kid in...

Definitely recommend if you're in the mood for some Hawaiian style eatery. But I certainly wouldn't go out my way for it.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If you are going here for a loco moco think twice, this is by far the worst loco iv ever tasted in Vegas. The gravy was on a lighter color with an off  smell and horrible taste ordered over med eggs got the over cooked."}
{"text":"Order of garlic cheese fries- little garlic(seems to be a trend, garlic shrimp the past few times has been less garlic),shredded cheese and fries that tasted like they absorbed their weight in grease. Chicken katsu sandwich was almost all bun.  It was probably the thinnest piece of chicken katsu I've ever seen. Had mayo and ketchup on bottom of bun, lettuce on the top what had color was yellow the hard center part that normally gets discarded not served. Husband had steamed chicken curry one of the healthier menu options.  He said his was pretty good although not spicy like he likes it it did have the flavor of a little bit of spice. I sure hope it was only my menu choices this time that made this friendly place a little less desirable."}
{"text":"The mochi chicken is so good! It comes with 2 small scoops of white rice, shredded cabbage bed, and mac salad. I usually just finish the mochi chicken over everything else. If it's not mochi chicken, I get BBQ chicken and it's served the same way as the mochi chicken and all their other dishes. 
Hmm... The service is good, but awkward... even though I know they don't mean to be. They're still nice, though!"}
{"text":"It was good but it took a long time to get my mean."}
{"text":"Aloha N Vegas yelpers!

My bf introduced me to Hawaiian Barbeque. It's our neighborhood Hawaiian spot.

Reading all the good reviews I got excited! I've been here a few times and ordered the laulau & kalua pig combo and the seafood and bbq short ribs combo. Either the meat was too dry or the taste wasn't right. 

Considering other local spots in Las Vegas, I have to say I had better. My bf still likes coming here because it's close to us but I choose Hawaiian Barbeque as my last resort... sorry! I rather drive into town to eat at other Hawaiian spots.

1 star for location and 1 star for variety on their menu.

I'm sure I'll be back... I'll try other things on the menu and maybe... just maybe I'll bump it up to 3 stars."}
{"text":"Saw this place and decided to give it a try and it was so damn bomb the teriyaki was so good not bad in price and plenty of food for your money"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here to get some of there boba drinks. We had our son there also, my wife gave my son a sip of her dink and the lady behind the counter yelled at my wife \" mama do not give that drink to your child\" it was so embarrassing since there where several other people dinning there everybody stopped and looked at us...we are very good parents and don't need some stranger telling us not to give our son a sip of our drink... never again will I give this place my hard earend money, my family and friends will no longer din here and I don't recommend this place to any one reading this"}
{"text":"Great local business love there food and service is always nice and patient.  The chicken Katsu is so delicious with the honey glaze. I cant get enough of it. My wife always gets something different and is aways in heaven. They need to get green tea boba and ill give it a perfect score."}
{"text":"Mac salad no taste. Kalbi was rubbery.  Maybe because I came before closing. Would not go back."}
