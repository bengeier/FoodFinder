{"text":"Très original! Goûter au jus lulo! Et aux arepas! Les proprios sont super sympathiques et un bel emplacement au cur du mile end. Portion copieuses"}
{"text":"The la Colombiana empanada was a tasty warm up treat to the absolutely fantastic and satisfying patacones! The Ave Maria pues patacone was great and I could fold the plantain into a taco, which made it easy to eat! Everything is gluten free, something I don't necessarily care about but it's important to add. The poco de gallo was also incredible!

The juices too are very unique and fresh and you can mix and match flavors! 

I want to come back to try the arepas sometime. Definitely a unique montréal eatery worth trying!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful way to get aquatinted with Columbia's gluten-free offerings!

Between the delightfully tasty arepas (as sandwiches or served separately) to the crunchy cornmeal empanadas filled with delicious chicken and continuing to the glorious patacón made from unripened plantain that serves as a bed for vegetarian offerings or beef, chicken, or fish.

Definitely check out their brunch options too (available between 10am and 2pm everyday).

I couldn't say nicer things about the attentive and glowing staff.  I love all the hearts, hanging from the ceiling and adorning the staffs' aprons.

Plenty of free street parking, so don't miss it!  Well worth any detour, this place is a real gem."}
{"text":"Nice reasonably priced place for tasty gluten free options and even gluten free empanadas. Arepas are prepared very well and patacones are a good filling option. Order the beef or go vegetarian. Service was also quite nice."}
{"text":"Fresh & healthy Columbian food in cute colourful surroundings. 

I also very much enjoyed my mango drink.

Back, I will be, yes yes..."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this sweet spot on St Viateur so much I was back within days, bringing a delighted gluten-free friend along with me. The main eats here are sets of tasty toppings with names like Mariachi! either on arepas or on a friend plantain, so either way your celiac stalwarts can take it. I enjoyed the piles of avocado and fresh salsa and melty cheese on the crispy fried plantain the first lunch I found myself at Corazon for this week, and the arepa later in the week was even cozier. The decor is cozy, bright, welcoming, and this whole room seats under twenty. The best design bit is the music box innards lined up along the cash counter. They are delightful. I am full of delight. 

This is clearly a family joint, with sweet kids helping out and generally helpful, sincere, smiling faces everywhere, even when you do something spectacularly awkward like throw the glass stopper from the water bottle into the salsa."}
{"text":"What an amazing place in the Mile End area of Montreal.
Was visiting Montreal for 5 days and ate here twice. I still dream about their chicken sandwiches in the cornmeal buns.

I wish there was this good of a Colombian eatery near me. I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great options, vegetarian and vegan options available along with meat.. Strongly suggest the vegan empanadas and the cappuccino was great!! Friendly service :)"}
{"text":"It delivers what it promises!! Excellent Colombian food ( both arepas and patacones). Not expensive at all and great service. 

I tried the \"Pibe\" patacon and the shredded beef was amazing. I'm coming back next weekend for brunch."}
