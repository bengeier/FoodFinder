{"text":"Came in last night and it was great! The nice young man and woman treated me with great customer service. The food was great and I definitely recommend to check out if you're in the area. Prices are very affordable and the atmosphere is outstanding. Definitely going back here when I'm in the area"}
{"text":"Went there for a shawarma today and the two nice young ladies there let me know they no longer have it. They suggested a chicken burrito instead. I decided to try it out and it was the most amazing burrito I've had in a while. The young man there was also very polite and all staff made me feel welcomed and not just another person. Great job."}
{"text":"Awesome spot with the most friendly service. Terrific mix of Caribbean and Mediterranean food. Love the shawarma plate."}
{"text":"I feel bad posting such a low review as the lady there was super nice. The shawarma was nice but all else was mediocre (to be nice). The chicken was cold in my taco bowl (didn't work for me), the Miami beef was not great tasting and the nachos were super oily. The guacamole tasted ok but I don't think it was made there. Mojito was horrible, neon green premix. Couldn't get past one sip."}
{"text":"Miami Beach Grill has been on my radar for timmmeeeeeeee! I saw them pop up on Instagram of all places and then as if my keystrokes were being monitored, they popped up all over my Yelp feed. Long have I been searching for a decent Cubano sandwich since my local spot shut down. Today I finally got to pay them a visit.

I was surprised when I figured out where they were located, they're in the Tuscany Plaza right out front of Vaughan Mills Mall - damn as if this plaza needed more great food, it basically has everything good you could want, and now Latin American eats! Boom sucka!

I should mention that just because they're claiming Miami beach status doesn't mean that they're strictly Cuban. Heck no! I learned today that their staff and food are basically a rainbow of Latin American countries and their various cuisine all wrapped up into one. Worth noting that they're also killing it on the private dining buyouts and the catering gigs so if you have a special occasion coming up I think they'd be a legit choice!

Today was basically me living my own version of Sophies Choice, having to choose between Miami Short Ribs and my long sought after Cubano Sammy. Instead of choosing I ordered both... #fatguyproblems. 

The Miami short ribs were super flavourful, however, I found the meat to be a touch thin compared to other short ribs I've had. It comes with two sides, and both the vegetable rice and the black beans with corn were AMAZING! All in it was 11.99 for this dish I believe and while it ate like comfort food it was actually pretty healthy if you manage your own portions - lord knows they don't and they're super generous.

The Cubano was legit, roasted pork, with the pickles and mustard on a bun grilled to perfection on a flat top. It came with a side as well so I went with the salad. I had a couple of bites of the sandwich so I would be able to comment on it but I'm saving this for my dinner tonight. My one critique was that the roasted pork had gone a little dry (maybe too long in the chafing dish?) There were parts that were still very succulent. I'd be inclined to ask when they roast the pork and then be there right away to get this when everything is fresh fresh.

Overall, a great experience only made better by their generous Yelp Check-in offer of 20% your order! I can't wait to come back for more!

{"text":"Recommended by my wife's friend. Unsure what to get...ended up with the first Yelp reviewers reco. Chicken Shawarma platter was yum and the serving was enough for 2 meals. Great service. Looking forward to having it for dinner again. Don't settle for the Vaughan Mills Food Court. This place is just steps away (north side of Vaughan Mills). Across the parking lot of Boston Pizza. Enjoy."}
{"text":"My family and I came here earlier today and I was surprised in a few ways. On yelp, this restaurant had an almost perfect rating and I imagined it would be more of a formal sit down restaurant than a fast food joint. I put my first impression aside and decided to enjoy the dining experience.

The restaurant had maybe five tables that can hold about 4-6 people (they also have one high chair onsite for toddlers). My family looked at the menu and placed their orders while I went up to the cash register to speak with the employees to find out what items I could eat. The employees brought out some of the packaging and I discovered I could safely eat their tacos, since they use corn tortillas. Talk about being lucky!  When the employees were ready to make my tacos, they called me over and let me pick all of the toppings. There were so many great toppings to choose from including shrimp ceviche, mango, pesto, pickled turnips and more. My taco looked so colourful when they finished adding the ingredients; I was very happy with my choice. 

Everyone else ordered some of the meat dishes including: carne asada, chicken and ribs. My family found the meats a little over cooked but still flavourful and they all loved the side-dishes. Some of the sides included shrimp ceviche, arroz con pollo, salads and more. We also ordered guacamole and chips to start and everyone loved them (I could eat the guacamole but not the chips). 

My tacos tasted amazing. The toppings I choose were selected to make it juicy without using cheese and sour cream, which both include dairy. Allover, my tacos tasted fantastic! My only complaint was the meat was a bit tough at the bottom of my tacos. Luckily the toppings I choose helped make it go down a little easier. 

Allover, I would say this restaurant is a solid three stars (good in my eyes). The only thing that would make this place better is not overcooking their meat. 

The guys working there were from Venezuela and they were really nice. We also ordered pops from the fridge behind the cash register. I tried the guava one and really enjoyed it. My father tried a yellow one (I think it was pineapple flavoured and he really enjoyed his as well)."}
{"text":"Awesome place great mix of mediteranian carribean and latin ... and its halal . Definately planning to go back this week"}
{"text":"There's something chemical tasting about the pork, not sure what. They can't make arepas to save their lives. The teque√±os are the only good thing on the menu. It's not bad but not the best."}

Miami Beach Grill is the home of latin style BBQ!
I first heard about Miami Beach Grill when they catered an entrepreneurship event this past summer. I personally met the owner Guilia and heard her story about her dream to open a restaurant. 
Miami Beach Grill has some amazing food! I actually called in advance to make reservations, not knowing that this is a fast food type of restaurant. 

Pros
Large portions, one main is enough for 2 people honestly. 
Cerviche was huge with at least 20 shrimp and housemade nachos. 
They are famous for their BBQ beef ribs, they were juicy and very flavourful. 
Tried the Mango and Guava Jarritos, some very unique drinks. 
For sides MUST try the fried plantains and spanish vegetable rice. 
There is beer and liquor available. 
The music and food really set the atmosphere.

Cons
Location is very far North and not very transit accessible. 
Casual dining with plastic chairs and tables.
When you look at the menu there are no photos, definitely ask the staff questions so you know what is on the menu. 
Don't sit near the front door, you'll feel the cold. 

Protip - The fried cheese didn't seem to be on the menu, this is a very unique item that I have never had before. It's shaped like a square and fried in a way that makes the cheese crispy.

{"text":"Ever since my friend brought me here I've been obsessed. It was total chance we ended up here that day. The food is healthy and so delicious. If you've had a good sweat session and need to refuel this is where you've gotta go. We tried the shrimp ceviche with plantain chips and the Miami short ribs with Spanish rice & steamed veggies. Very generous portion and more than enough for 2 people to share. I've been back a few times and have also tried the empanadas, Cuban sandwich and cake for dessert. The beef empanada is the best and the sauce it comes with takes it to the next level. On my last visit I met the owner. She was very sweet. Support small businesses!"}
{"text":"On a suggestion, I headed out to Miami Beach Grill, thanks God I went!
Having a strip mall location just outside VMills had me skeptical and wondering how good could they be.
I found a diamond in the rough, after ordering the shrimp ceviche, miami ribs, and pesto chicken. Portions were generous, hot, and sides well complimentary of the mains!! 
The prices very reasonable and my only negative experience was that they didn't have wine in stock, I'm guessing it's not ordered much so why carry it.
My Corona was actually best to wash down this south american blend of goodness!
I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Deliciosa la comida. Muy buena la atencion. La carne asada estaba deliciosa t el postre tres leches ni hablar. Definitivamente un sitio para recomendar."}
{"text":"THE FOOD WAS DELICIOUS.  I Was a great alternative to the usual chinesw food and burger store. The flavoura were delicious. The menu was good. I hate when there is too much on a menu. But the steak was juicy the chicken had meny flavoura. I CANT SAY ENOUGH! If your looking for somethinf new.. give this place a try. I Visited once and plan to come back. The tres leche was yummy too :)"}
{"text":"Great food and service ! We had the chimichinga , steak sandwich , shrimp appetizer and short ribs. The short ribs were my favourite"}
{"text":"Easily my one and only go-to lunch spot for a healthy and delicious meal any time I am in Vaughan! Grilled-to-order clean and well seasoned meats with super fresh veggie sides. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food at this place reminds me of a BBQ i would attend while on vacation down south with friends. The restaurant itself is very casual in both appearance and attitude. Service is like ordering with friends, anything you need they are happy to accomodate.

I had the opportunity to try several of their specialties. Started with an order of the Carne Asada with spanish rice, then had the opportunity to try the Miami short ribs and finally Chimichurri Chicken. All very flavorful and cooked on a grill giving them a authentic outdoor grill taste. 

The Asada was probably the toughest of the meats and required some extra effort to chew, the ribs were tender but thinner than the Asada, the chicken was also very tender and a flavorful. The rice was tasty and made with spanish rice so the texture was firm.  I also ordered 2 empanadas as well which are made on site. The dough was not the usual flake type but more a crispier dough and very good.  

In the end I was quite full after eating what I'd describe a Miami buffet! Overall, a this place is a very nice change from the ordinary grill. BBQ food cooked with Latin flare, I can certainly imagine this place being even busier in the winter months when BBQ craving are at their highest."}
{"text":"After reading all the 5/5 Yelp reviews I was expecting this place to be amazing but my experience was far from what other Yelpers described. When we came on a Thursday night the place was dead, we were the only customers there. The menu is pretty limited and a lot of the pics posted on Yelp could not be found on the menu e.g. shawarma plate

I ordered the short ribs which comes with choice of two sides. I chose the rice and a salad for my two sides. The rice tasted like rocks, reminds me of the texture rice gets when it's been left sitting too long. The grilled short ribs were burnt and overly salted with no other flavors. I was given a sweet and sour sauce as rib sauce which didn't make any sense. The only passable item was the salad. To be blunt, what I ate is not the calibre of food that deserves 4.5 star rating on Yelp. Needless to say I'm quite disappointed as I really wanted to like this place.

Despite the taste of the food itself (maybe it was an off day or perhaps I ordered the right things?) im giving this place a 3 star because I really liked the friendliness of the service person, the large portion and the fact that I was able to use the 20% check in discount."}
