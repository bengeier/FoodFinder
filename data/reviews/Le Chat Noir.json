{"text":"Late dinner last night at Le Chat Noir was delicious. I love their sour-salty cornichon pickles! To start we shared a roasted beet salad prepared with a deeply umami mushroom vinaigrette. For our main course we each enjoyed sautéed salmon with accompanying vegetables and a side of extraordinary goat cheese tart.   We found Le Chat Noir by happy accident after wandering around a rainy Vieux Montreal. Restaurants we had sought out after reading Yelp reviews were either to stuffy in appearance or too crowded to have an intimate conversation.  Sadly we had no room for dessert but a couple leaving as we arrived, unsolicited, raved about their dessert so we're going back later in our trip to find out for ourselves..."}
{"text":"If you only eat out once in scarborough eat here. They serve contempary french food in a quiet pleasant atmosphere. It is well priced and as many ingredients as possible are sourced locally. If you like cider their french cider is a classic.excellent"}
{"text":"I've been waiting an hour and a half for an omelette. I'm literally starving at the table. My coffee took 25 minutes to get here and is now cold. The place is nearly empty... Maybe they're waiting for the hen to lay the eggs.   Thru haven't even offered us bread while we wait."}
{"text":"Went to dinner with my Father last night. We both had the beef bourguignon that was a very bland version of the one I was used to. For appetizers I had the French onion soup and he had the beef tartar. Fast forward to 3 am I am woken up by my father throwing up violently. This went on for hours. I however did not get sick. The waitress was very friendly and helpful however. With all of the great food choices near by I would take your money else where."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner. Escargot was fantastic. Duck poutine divine. Creme brûlée was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Defnitely British and now under new ownership, this has to be one of the jewels in Scarborough's crown. Beautifully crafted and served food in comfortable and intmate surroundings beg for a speedy re-visit. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Billed as a true Brittany experience I was keen to try this place along with my girlfriend who spent the majority of her childhood there. On entering I noticed a strange musty smell. We were soon seated by the chef who was very pleasant and talked us through the specials. I found the prices very reasonable. To drink we had French cider which was very good. To start I had a salad of egg, ham and crouton. The crouton was just sliced toast, the egg was fried and the ham was cut up sliced and there was no dressing. Very bad. My girlfriend had a gallette which she found very nice. For mains I had saucissons Bretons which was very poor. This was boiled sausages, from Yorkshire !!, on top of a soggy pancake. My girlfriend had a gallette with salmon and cheese which she found very nice. Perhaps I made the wrong choices but what I had was very poor but the girlfiends was fine. Prices reasonable, decor nice, service good and staff pleasant. I would come here again but be extra careful what I chose"}
{"text":"On our trip to Montreal we've already come several times and hope to continue coming. All of their food is so fresh and the waitresses treat you like family they've known forever. The duck poutin is soooo delicious as is the florentine and egg pie and the omelettes. I haven't tasted anything bad plus they have great, dark coffee (always a plus!). We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is a real gem of a place! Specialising in crepes from the Brittany region, this restaurant uses local produce. The sausage filled crepes are particularly good, and there are also some suitable for vegetarians too.    French cider, wines and Belgian beer are available as well as hot drinks.    The sweet crepes are good too. Highly recommended is chocolate and banana crepe, which is full of rich chocolate and slices of banana and is very filling!"}
{"text":"This place is Very Very Authentic French, Beet Salad, Duck Hamburger, Salade Cesar, and awesome Pizza! Family owned and operated, some of the nicest people We spoke to in Vieux Montreal!"}
{"text":"We wanted to like this place, so badly. But two stars is all we could give. We arrived for dinner around 7pm and were seated promptly without reservations. There was only one other party dining at the time. Perhaps that should have been our cue to turn around and leave. We ordered our drinks quickly, along with a children's meal.  The waitress was extremely nice and did her best info coaxing us into ordering certain appetizers, stressing that lots of the items were home made. The children's entree (pizza) came out rather quickly, thank goodness. Then the drinks (4) took forever. From what we could tell, it was a one woman show -- same lady was taking orders and making drinks. The appetizer, which was the cheese plate, came out a long while later (approx 30 min) and was utterly disappointing. For almost $30, you got four sliver of cheeses with old, toasted bread - totally not worth it. Then the painful part came - waiting for our entrees. When we told the waitress we were through with our appetizer and for her not to delay the entrees because there was still cheese left, she informed us that the other table hadn't received their entrees yet and that we were next in line. After about 2 long hours of waiting, we finally got our entrees. Food was mediocre at best. It was such a painful dining experience. Don't get me wrong, the staff was friendly and it seemed like they were genuinely trying, but it was painful and looooong. They really need to get their stuff together with all of the other great options closeby otherwise I don't see them staying open for long."}
{"text":"What more can you expect than a pleasant and quick service, warm atmosphere (no loud music, you can have a discussion !),  and real good food (some authentic french classics but also some more modern adaptations such as the Duck-Hachis) ? Reasonably priced. We're french from NY, been there twice and would go again on a next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"We loved this place as it is exactly what we were looking for. French food and style. I found it a bit pricey but it was well worth it. The food was very tasty and service was excellent!"}
{"text":"On our first night in Montreal, my wife and I were out walking and were fortunate to happen upon this gem of an eatery. The menu was varied, yet each item had its own unique and wonderful character. From the lighting, to the music, to the presentation, Le Chat Noir offered a lovely eating experience and set the tone for what turned out to be a lovely five days in Montreal."}
{"text":"A very pleasant French Bistro next to the Notre Dame Basilica.   On the last day of visit to Montreal I was walking by on my way to somewhere else and happened upon this place. I was in the mood for a light lunch so ordered the salmon tartare and a glass of white Bordeaux. Before the main meal arrived a jar of house made pickles and basket of small warm rolls arrived - both of which were delicious. The wine and salmon were equally tasty and I left a very happy man.  The service was excellent and the decor was kind of 'French cafe meets Leather bar' - comfortable and cool yet a little weird. Lastly, it's been a while since I last visited Montreal and I noticed that for some reason Pizza seems to have the invaded the menus of almost every cuisine in town - and this French bistro was no exception. Should you eat here - and you should - I would suggest sticking to the French food."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Our server Emilie was superb.  We had the salmon tartare, beet salad, French onion soup, and duck burgers. Just awesome."}
{"text":"Burger was worst than frozen patties you get at the supermarket. Came here without reading reviews. See attached picture."}
{"text":"Poor service. If you're here in Montreal as a tourist and have things to do avoid. Average food and ridiculous wait times. If you are a big group, that's another reason to avoid since the waitress wouldn't care about service since tips is automatically included in the bill. Not sure if it's Montreal culture, but very poor service"}
{"text":"Le resto à touristes c'est bien ici. On passait juste pour un verre, le serveur à mis 2 phrases pour comprendre qu'on parlait français puis la serveuse a apporté une tasse avec du rouge à lèvre encore collé dessus, si ça peut arriver dans le rush du dîner, on a du mal à laisser passer ça à ce moment là vu que nous étions les seuls clients en plein après-midi. Outre le service moyen, la deco est très bizarre (mi France mi World Trade Center) ce qui donne une ambiance étrange et pas vraiment agréable. La carte avait l'air intéressante même si je ne comprend pas trop le concept de faire un resto \"français\" dans le vieux port de Montréal, un quartier qui se veut authentiquement québécois, et visiblement mes doutes sont fondés car les seconds clients ont commandé une Poutine... J'espère qu'elle était bonne!"}
{"text":"I can only review this place for it's pizza - I had the Rocket pizza (arugula, proscuitto, fresh parmesan, and mozarella - so good! One of the best pizzas I've ever had...I'm only sad that I came for lunch and couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"I'm quite sad because the reviews sang praises about Le Chat Noir, but I'm assuming it's because the dishes we ordered were rather bad? Pro tip: don't get the dishes I ate.  Le Chat Noir is a very odd restaurant. They have American flags and a gigantic peace sign, but they serve French cuisine. On a Sunday afternoon there were hardly any customers inside the restaurant. Bottled water costs extra, but tap water is free, so it'd be better if you just got tap! We waited for our food for a very long time, but they gave us homemade pickles and bread as appetizers. The pickles were tiny and pretty sour, which was unfortunate because i LOVE pickles- just not the pickles here. I did like the cafeteria-style bread, however. It was soft and chewy.  The French Onion Soup was definitely NOT French Onion Soup. It contained slices of crispy baguettes covered in cheddar cheese and melted into an overly rich, steamy broth. The escargot was similarly covered in a weird, funky cheese and definitely not appetizing. Finally, the Soup of the Day was a carrot bisque that was overly peppery and uninteresting. The trifecta of blah food really gave my friend and I a dissatisfactory experience.   Try Le Chat Noir if you want, but do NOT order any of the above dishes- absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"À la recherche d'un petit bistro pour un dîner après spectacle, nous avons testé le chat noir. Le menu était alléchant avec divers choix de cuisine française.   Nous avons pris un verre de vin et un steak frites tout deux très bons. En attendant le plat, les cornichons étaient délicieux également. La raison des trois étoiles est le prix surfait et le service, assis près des cuisines, nous avons entendu toutes les plaintes de la serveuse à propos des clients..."}
{"text":"Honestly one one the worst meals in a long time! The duck terrine was half heated on a microwave and tasted like dog food. Steak and Frites was over cooked and the fries soaked in oil. And the list goes on. Simply horrible food... (Now it's called Le Chat Noir.)"}
{"text":"The owner was excellent and attentive. Good vibe. Great food.  Each meal with careful attention.  We had the brunch which was great.  The espresso is smooth and creamy."}
{"text":"We've eaten here many times and have always enjoined the food and presentation. Recently, thought, they've stopped serving their complimentary signature mini pickles. Our dinner last night was good, except for the steak, which one of of had, and a few other reviewers have also noted, was terrible. It basically consisted of a small piece of chewy gristle. We were hungry, so I didn't send it back, but for $30.00, suffice it to say, I was very disappointed. We really like this restaurant, love visiting old Montreal, and may be willing to give it another try if reviews improve. Please start serving the pickles again, and increase the quality and size of the steaks."}
{"text":"Really should be half a star. Orders took 1 hour and 15 minutes. Two orders were tuna and vegetable salads that would have been better from our local grocery store. I had a chicken fish that was a tiny, dried out filet with a dab of barbecue sauce. Very overpriced given the poor quality. With so many other options in Old Montreal, avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"We loved it! The duck breast was fantastic. Wait staff was very friendly and welcoming. I'd recommend!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. First of all we came for dinner on January 1st so I am sure this was one of their busiest times of year. Many restaurants had already closed in the old port and we didn't have any reservations, so this was a great last minute decision. Right when we entered we were warmly greeted by the hostess and immediately seated. Our drinks were swiftly brought out, and we were served warm bread with pickles as a complimentary appetizer. Up until this point I would given the place a solid 4 star rating for service, however once we placed our orders we waited for at least 1 hour for our food.  I ordered the escargot for my first course and sadly the cheese was not what I expected. It had a very strong flavor, but the snails were nice and tender. My friends were dissatisfied with their meal. One ordered a burger and the other had salmon with mashed potatoes. I admit the salmon and potatoes were very bland and the burger was very basic.  I ordered the salmon tartar with French fries. The tartar was AMAZING. I was blown away by the flavors. I don't know if the chef who made the tartar was the same as who made the  salmon, but the tartar was spectacular while the baked salmon was blah. My fries had a honey after flavor and it came with a mayo dipping sauce with a slight garlic taste. I was not completely sure if I liked the fries, but it was something different.  Overall, the chef who made the salmon tartar made my night, while the rest of the food was bland or very sweet. The service was slow, but very friendly and the ambiance was cozy with candles on each table. Would I return again? Yes, but only for the salmon tartar and maybe for some drinks."}
{"text":"I am reviewing this as we are waiting for some so called brunch items and I have to say that it took around 45 minutes to get the order to our table. It wasn't busy, if you are wondering. I am giving two stars only because the waitresses were trying to apologize while they were multitasking. They simply did not have staff.  Quality of food poor to mediocre. Oh, by the way I am a food service director and a chef, in case you think I don't know what I am talking about. Sorry, close to Notre-Dame and not being prepared??? This experience is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Waiter was super nice, but the food was not good at all. Overpriced for the quality. Foie gras was super market quality. Charcuterie meats were dry. Would not recommend to someone"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst dining experiences we had. It began with the limited menu and unaccomdating staff. As a vegan, the menu was limited but there were some sides I could eat. Except they wouldn't let me order sides separately. We watched while all other tables were served break and waited 30 minutes for ours. Finally after 45 minutes, the kids food came out. My husband ordered steak, I ordered the appetizer beet salad, both of which took 90 minutes to arrive. During this time the waitress didn't update us, check on us, even after we expressed concern.  I would never go again."}
{"text":"We currently are in \"Le Chat Noir\" and it's been an hour and a half we are awaiting for our dishes."}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants that looks cute and has some definite redeeming qualities, but just isn't as good as it should be (especially for the price). Let me start with the good-we had a great attentive waitress, the cocktails were tasty, and the escargot was fabulous! So garlicky and buttery...Just perfect. Unfortunately, the rest of the food was just sad. The beef bourginion was chewy and bland, the salmon looked like cat food, the veggies looked like frozen....So sad. Maybe go for the escargot and then move on for dinner."}
{"text":"After contemplating where to eat in old Montreal, we chose Le Chat Noir. We had the cream of leek soup, cauliflower augratin, croque monsiur, lamb, and creme brûlée with grand marnier. The whole meal was absolutely amazing. Definitely one of the best meals, if not the best, meals I have ever had. The waitress (I did not get her name) talked to us for such a long time and was so personal and wonderful. She told us things to do in the area and was just very sweet. We will definitely be back on our next trip! Excellent place!"}
{"text":"...cute place very close to Notre Dame.  Thus, you'd think they'd expect hordes on the weekend.  Alas, not. Thus the service was slow, but the server was sweet.   The food was quite good.   Had the duck terrine which was yummy.  Friend had an awesome looking burger."}
