{"text":"Excellent pizza! Fresh ingredients with a great staff. Their bread is delivered to your table fresh out of the warmer, which adds to the great experience."}
{"text":"Great family Italian restaurant. From when you walk through the door to you when you sit down order your first glass of wine you'll feel right at home at this place.  Food is made fresh to order. Prices are great you won't be disappointed and if your local you'll definitely return."}
{"text":"I can  see  that the phone number is wrong....450-455-9300.....I am there so often, I know it by heart.....a must try....it will become like home....delicious!"}
{"text":"From the second you walk in such great ambiance and welcoming. Option to eat outside on their cozy terrace with flowers everywhere.If you are in the mood for Authentic Italian this is a great treat for a date night. We ordered & shared the Primavera Pizza (thin delicious crust made in a fire burning oven). Also ordered the meat balls as appetizer soo tender sitting in a bowl of tomato sauce and parmesan slices on top. Owner came to say hello and help the waiter fix our moving table. Owner also stood up to say goodbye as we left the restaurant which was very sweet and warm. A little gesture like this makes you feel so good and makes you want to return over and over."}
{"text":"Great little Italian restaurant. Real Authentic Italian restaurant . The staff is very friendly and great service. Everything we order was great from the pasta ,pizza and veal. The veal was very tender . The pizza was amazing . Everything was fresh and made to perfection. This is worth the drive and the money . Trattoria Lanni is sure a hit . We will be back"}
{"text":"Le meilleur resto italien à l'ouest de Montréal. La pizza cuite au four à bois, les pâtes et le veau sont dignes d'une vrai trattoria ."}
{"text":"This was a dinning disaster. The food was dry and overcooked with no good flavor. Service was also lacking i was one of three tables and the wait was extremely long. The final kicker was the parmesan cheese was not freshly grated at table side. It was served from a metal bowl and it looked and tasted like store bought processed cheese from a plastic bottle. I would not recommend this restaurant if you are looking for good Italian food."}
{"text":"My husband and I were very satisfied with our experience at this restaurant!  From the minute we were greeted at the door to the moment we left!

We were promptly greeted at the door!  The staff is very polite! Service was at a great pace!  Not rushing us and not pushing us out the door!

The food was amazing!  I had the primavera pizza which was very good!!!  They bring you a little homemade spicy oil on the table to accompany the pizza if you want to add a little!  I dared and was not disappointed!  Added a little zing to the pizza!  Loved it!  
My husband started out out with the polpetta parmigiana as an appetizer (that I gladly shared).
(2 meatballs in tomato sauce with basil and shaved parmigiana cheese)  These were so amazing!  
His main course was linguine fruit de mer.  Lots of sea food in his plate and the pasta was cooked to perfection.  And what to say of the taste?  Yum yum!  All in all, this was our first experience, but not not our last!
I definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Chaque plat que j'ai essayé à la Trattoria sont tous devenus des coups de coeur!!
Et l'ambiance typiquement italienne rend toutes les soirées agréables à souhait.
Le personnel est aussi très accueillant."}
{"text":"Belle découverte 
Une excellente minestrone et un beau tendre et goûteux
À mettre sur la carte des réguliers"}
