{"text":"Love it. Albert At the bar is fabulous. Fried zucchini light as a feather.  All 3 of us very happy.   Best was Maureen's sangria. So smooth."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with a group of 8 of us. Its a good place for groups and kid friendly for the neighborhood. We got the calamari and stuffed banana pepper appetizers, and the banana peppers were definitely good and spicy. They also bring complimentary bread and dipping oil to the table which is nice. For entrees, the eggplant parmesean was definitely the stand out dish and was a HUGE, you get two meals out of it. As for pasta, the gnocchi themselves were good, but the only sauce our group cared for was the marinara. The bolognese tasted like taco meat and lacked flavor as did the vodka sauce. We split the prosciutto and arugula pizza, and it was way overpriced at $19. The crust was good, but flavor totally lacking. Poor quality prosciutto that tasted like lunchmeat ham. Piccolo forno and driftwood oven are where to go for pizza in the neighborhood. Overall, meh, but get the eggplant parm and skip the overpriced pizza if you go"}
{"text":"We went to dinner on a Tuesday night and had pretty incredible food. There were only two other parties the whole time we were there which makes me concerned at this restaurant will not last more than a year. There are a few too many TVs which lost a star and the wine/beer lists were ok. lasagne, fried zucchini, brownie cheese cake were awesome!  
Salad/veggies were very fresh.

My kids can be a pain but they loved the pizza and liked the chicken fingers. I hope this place lasts."}
{"text":"This was the best dinner we have had in a while. The staff was awesome and the food was so delicious. We are definitely going back soon. But make sure you reserve weeks ahead."}
{"text":"Alida's was highly recommended and we were not steered wrong. From the time we walked in, to the time we left, it was a very enjoyable evening.  The atmosphere and decor is very pleasing to the eye, very comfortable without over doing it. We started out with our usual appetizer, Zucchini which was lightly breaded and very good. I ordered  the Chicken Romano, which I highly recommend. My husband had the Veal Scallopino, which he really enjoyed. We tried a side of the Saffron Risotto, which tasted just like the Northern Italians have been making for over 50 years. We ended the meal with a pecan ball, which completed our dinner nicely. 
My husband and I eat our every weekend and we are glad we found their gem of a restaurant. A nice addition to the Lawrenceville neighborhood.  We are looking forward to taking friends on our next visit!"}
{"text":"Amazing fresh food. Vanilla pecan ice cream is phenomenal !!!
I will highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We have been to Alida's twice now and both times the food and service was excellent! We went with a group of 8 on Saturday night while the temperatures were frigid, and the place was comfortably crowded with tables enjoying the evening. Everyone in our group was very pleased with the experience, as it was the first time there for the rest of our friends. The food was delicious, presented beautifully and our service was great all evening long. We are happy that we have found a new place to dine on good Italian food in a welcoming atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I've been eating to check this place out for a while. Everyday I go by this restaurant and thinking I have to check it out! Recently we finally check this place out. I LOVE it. We got the fried Calamari and Autunno Bianca. Our waitress told us that is her favorite and one of the most popular pizza. The calamari was good and  so was the pizza. When I first got it, to be honest, I was not impressed with it. I was expecting more, I felt like it was lacking flavors. At that point, I was giving this pizza a 5.5 out of 10. But shortly after I ate more of it, I realized it was much better now. I'm not sure it was the parmesan cheese + hot pepper made the difference or the hot sausage flavor started to kick in. It was very flavorful and the crust was prefect. I had some leftovers the next day and ended up loving it more! I will definitely go back there and try out some different pizza or pasta. 
They do have happy hours but it is for drinks only, I think it was $1 off wine $2 off draft or the other way around. It is not a bad deal but I wish they would bring on some food specials for happy hour!"}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in to Alida's to give something new a try. It was very good! We had the wedding soup which was very tasty. The drinks and pizza were also very good, and our service was fantastic. Our server, Chrissy, was very accommodating and did a great job. Nothing to complain about. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Grazie! We are really happy to have Alida's in Pittsburgh, let alone in our neighborhood. I can't wait to go back after having dinner from just appetizers of bocce balls and calamari, which were both wonderful along with the fresh toasted bread and home made dipping sauce.
This is really good Italian food."}
{"text":"Yep, this is a local spot! Don't let the exterior make you think it's another new restaurant in the hood type of vibe. I've walked by a bit and have been looking for a reason to try and we did so last weekend. 

We came in on a Saturday evening and the place is near capacity. We grabbed one of two open tables left. We grabbed drinks and ordered the stuffed banana peppers and primavera pizza to share. They gave us bread and oil as we waited. The spicy oil was good and bread was ehh. It wasn't warm or special on any way.

The banana peppers arrived and we were done for! They were huge!!! We each ate one and couldn't eat much more, but boy was it delicious! The was a nice blend of sausage and peppers. It was also quite spicy! We didn't think banana peppers could make us sweat like that.

The pizza came and it was really good and turned out to be a nice balance to the stuffed banana peppers. We each could muster to eat one slice and had leftovers for both of us to have lunch the following day.

The vibe is very local. People knew each other and were quite friendly. Also, as you walk in you see the wood fire oven and know they're serious about their pizza. It's cool to see the people making the pizza as you wait, too. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is excellent - real Naples style pie with light, crisp/chewy dough and crushed tomatoes with mozz (none of that provolone nonsense....). Really great. The eggplant parm needs some help. Nobody wants the skin on an eggplant and they tasted, I don't know - just not like fresh fried eggplant mom would make. I know you can't have that in a restaurant, but something needs to change with that."}
{"text":"Thought the food and service were very good.  The pizza and meatballs were done well and my wife's salad, she stated, was very good.  I recommend grabbing some wine at Engine House 25 and then having a late dinner and some house red at Alida's."}
{"text":"We've been here now with kids and with friends and both kinds of experiences have been great! The atmosphere is comfortably warm with the wood fired oven on display in the corner. There are TVs showing sports, but it doesn't distract from their casual fine dining vibe. The staff all introduce themselves and really make you feel welcome. S/o to Gina, Franco, Chrissy, Maureen, & Joel. The servers are knowledgeable about all of the dishes and made some great suggestions on which ones to try. The bartenders serve up a mean Bloody Mary and there are 16 beers and ciders on tap to choose from. The Southern Tier 2x IPA was my favorite. You could easily eat a meal or just have drinks with friends at the bar area. We tried a variety of apps, main dishes, and pizzas. Pizzas were all winners and cooked right in view of the tables. They are easily big enough to share. For the rest, the stand outs were the stuffed hot peppers, calamari, gnocchi, \"bocce ball\" meatballs, ravioli, and veal scallopini. The tirimisu was delicate and delicious, but man oh man, the pecan ball was one of the best desserts that I have ever had. There is a kids menu, although mine didn't order from it, and it looks like the lasagna and chicken Caesar salad are a steal for their price, although we have yet to try them. The restaurant is right next to the Clemente Museum. There is a lot across from the restaurant, a rarity in L-vile, and street parking was also easy to get. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice and I really enjoyed it. People are friendly and it has a nice atmosphere, but also TV's in case your favorite team is playing. I LOVED the fried zucchini appetizer. They slice the zucchini thin in long, wide strips before battering and frying and they were so much more delicious than the usual stick o' zucchini. I also love their ravioli. Parking is pretty easy at night. Lot across the street or one 3 doors down for a museum that is closed at night."}
{"text":"They judge you and make you feel super uncomfortable. The hostess/manager walked past repeatedly staring at you"}
{"text":"Alida's food is outstanding.  So much more than just delicious pizza.  The chicken romano, eggplant parmesan, wedding soup, salmon, pasta  and meatballs are just a few of the fantastic dishes I have sampled.  The bar will not disappoint you either.  A nice beer and wine selection, with complementary \"garlic knots and fried dough\" to accompany your cocktail.  The service was superb.  Alida's is a wonderful new addition to Lawrenceville.  There is a parking lot for patrons which is something you don't see is Lawrenceville too often.  I say check it out. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"An Italian restaurant starts and ends with the sauce and Alida's passes this test. Nice consistency and savory without being too spicy. Most importantly, not loaded with sugar. With that out of the way,the rest of the review. This charming new Italian spot is quaint and homey. The menu is without pretense. Just good classic Italian comfort food. In the app menu the stuffed peppers and \"bocce balls\" are all-star stand outs. That said... Get the pizza. An Italian restaurant is judged on sauce but a pizza is judged on crust. The woodfired pizza crust here is perfect. Rolled thin, it's crispy on the outside but soft and doughy in the center. The toppings just add to the overall pie after that. 

The service is friendly and attentive without being a nuisance but do expect to be encouraged to eat like you're at your Italian grandmother's home. The bartenders are quick and friendly as well! Ask for Franco!

Highly encouraged spot... Just stay open later!"}
{"text":"We came here tonight because we live about a block away and wanted to try it out. The vibe of Alidia's is a mix between an Italian restaurant and a sports bar. The music was oldies which didn't really match what they appear to be going for. The food was good but the service was slow. I plan to come back again for a good meal but I don't don't think that it will be on my list of Lawrenceville recommendations."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in town. I'm a huge fan of the stuffed peppers, and both pasta dishes I have had, have been fantastic. I really enjoyed the local section of Beers, and the staff was very pleasant. I can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to have additional options in a neighborhood that has truly incredible food. Alida's seemed to potentially fill the much needed niche for a casual Italian restaurant/sports type of bar that is locally owned and provided an alternative to my usual favorites (Senti, Morcilla and Umami) very close to my home. I have been there 7 times since they opened for both dine in and carry out. The food is good (although it is tough when Piccolo Forno and Senti are close by) but not great, but the price point more than made up for the discrepancy. The service has been the bigger issue. I recognize that they are a new restaurant, which is why I was willing to overlook occasional lapses in service. In addition, some of the bartenders have been great when I have gone by to get food to go. However, I was taken aback by the service this evening. There was only one other person at the bar and a few patrons in The restaurant. I sat down to order -there was a bartender and a lady who may have been the manager. I recognize that they were busy but I was completely ignored, and no one even asked if I wanted a menu. In essence, they made me feel as though I was not welcome. After being ignored, I decided to go one block down the street to Senti, where I was immediately acknowledged, and had someone take my order. Granted, they are two different restaurants, but there should be a similar level of hospitality regardless of the type of establishment. 

I sincerely hope the management realizes that service is important. Given the many options in Lawrenceville, I will not go back again, even if the restaurant is a block away. It's really unfortunate, since they could have filled a potential niche in the area."}
{"text":"Decent Italian food, decent prices. It definitely has a family restaurant feel. And it was great for our friend who is a Pittsburgh sports fanatic as there are large TV screens in the corners of the restaurant. 

I must add - our experience was made \"interesting\" by the arrival of a knock-off Frank Sinatra singer. He aggressively approached dinner guests to sing along...unconsented karaoke style. I think he was asked to leave shortly afterward because his singing didn't last long. I don't think that is a regular occurrence here, but the food wasn't spectacular enough to bring us back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch.  Nice new place with a friendly bartender.  Service was good. It was not real crowded due to the late lunch time.   There is a wood fired pizza oven in the corner.  I had the Italian panini that has soppressata, salami and prosciutto along with some pepper relish, lettuce and tomato.  Enjoyed my meal.  Will have to stop back and try a pizza."}
{"text":"I'm just going to start off with most important thing you need to know about when going here: Order the bocce balls! I stopped in by chance on their soft opening day and was warmly welcomed. They brought over a little sample plate and the pasta and bocce balls (pork meatballs) were the star. Wasn't a fan of the margheritta pizza as it lacked flavor. I'd be willing to give the pizza one more shot though as it was the first day and the dough/crust was good."}
{"text":"Amazing! Had the black pepper tagliatelle with the wedding soup. Delicious! My special request chocolate martini was to die for. Definately coming back!"}
{"text":"One of the difficulties I find when traveling to the East End or Strip district is parking. Not here. Alida's shares parking lot space with the Roberto Clemente Museum lot. When I arrived I was told I could park there safely since they own a portion of that lot.

I came in for lunch and pretty much had the whole place to myself. They have a bar off to the side with a couple of TV sets. My waitress was very friendly and helpful with the menu choices. I've always loved meatball hoagies but never ordered them since they are usually served in hoagie buns.

Here they are served in thin paninis. Along with my sandwich I got a side of French Fries and ordered a cup of wedding soup. Alida's serves free bread with dipping sauce but believe me with the portion sizes you are getting there is no way I could even finish a slice of that bread.

The soup came fairly quickly with crackers. It was spot on delicious! Shortly afterwards I got my panini and although it was huge I was glad the panini was on the thin side. Meatballs were very good and very filling! Nothing special about the fries. They are the kind you pretty much get anywhere.

My waitress showed me dinner, drink, and dessert menus but there was no way I could even order dessert after all that food. Price of my lunch was fairly reasonable too.

Alida's Woodfire Cucina sits right next to the Clemente museum and at the juncture of Penn Ave and Butler St in lower Lawrenceville. Having the free parking helps since they do have a small sign outside indicating parking with an arrow facing forward but there is nothing telling you which is their lot without going inside. I'm glad I took a chance and was able to get that matter clarified."}
{"text":"We had a really delightful dinner here last night.  We had just visited the Clemente Museum nearby on Penn St, did a quick Yelp search and Alida's it was!!

Upon entering, there were three large groups and all appeared to be locals.  Great!  Very nice draft beer list for a place this size; kudos to the bartender who is a true professional; checked all glasses for spots after washing.  Waitress helped us while a waiter took care of the groups.  She did a nice job helping us with questions/requests.  Soup of the day was ham/bean/potato; turned out to be green beans but this was a surprising hit.  Very rich broth was the key.  I went with old faithful, Veal Parmesan with side of spaghetti; it was excellent.  Red sauce had some depth of flavor; pasta al dente; multi benne!!  Wife had a large salad with sauteed shrimp added; she loved it.  Bread is delicious and olive oil blend was unique and delicious.

Free parking lot is next to museum.

Great experience"}
