{"text":"Great customer service Very good food.... One thing about breakfast food that is always disappointing um is the lack of flavor in hash browns/breakfast potatoes...NOT HERE!!! the breakfast potatoes are beyond flavorful.  I would highly suggest this restaurant.  Decor is fun and interesting.  Very comfortable...."}
{"text":"Ken Hatfield has shown us what a marriage between comfort BBQ and fine cuisine looks like!! The mystery specials on Thursday are so creative and masterly prepared that I would consider ordering without even hearing about it.  The restaurant itself has a comfortable rustic feel that gives a modern chuck wagon dining experience. The service was excellent greeted and ordered almost immediately.   The side dishes!!! Oh the side dishes.... you cannot go wrong with any of them. The chili has a thicker cut of meat with the right cut of acidity. The mac and cheese has a sweet taste with a bacon finish. That's just to name a few!!!  Highly recommend to any BBQ enthusiast, or anyone who just enjoys damn good food. Cannot say enough about how awesome this place is. Keep up the great work!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast in town! After having dinner here a few weeks back (if you can, try the ribs--they are incredible), we stopped in for breakfast. The Hillbilly Benedict was the best breakfast I've had in years... Corn frittata, homemade pulled pork, fried egg, and a smoky hollandaise made for a meal that was crazy flavorful, fresh, and made to order. The bottomless coffee was excellent (and only $2 and change), and the cozy atmosphere complemented the impeccable service and food. My husband's meal, the Hillbilly Breakfast, was just as satisfying and featured the chef's famous sausage gravy (which definitely lives up to the acclaim). Hatfield's is friendly, tasty, and reasonably priced. We can't wait for our next visit!"}
{"text":"Hatfields is one of my favorite places to stop. The staff is friendly and laid back. I've had multiple items on the menu in my numerous visits and have never been let down. Their sauce is unrivaled. Stop if for lunch, dinner, brunch, just make sure you stop! Great addition to the West Park neighborhood."}
{"text":"To sum it up - Overpriced  The atmosphere is interesting, but not all that functional.   I got a burger. It was really good. But it wasn't 12 dollars good. For 2 burgers, 2 drinks (in a can) and a 10% tip it was almost $32.00. That's just too expensive in my opinion for what it was. I chose mac and cheese for a side. You'd think that for that price, you would get more than a spoonful.   The menu behind the counter is too small to read and it has a glare that makes it even worse.  Thank god the lady at the counter gave us paper menus.   The lady at the counter where you order was very nice and friendly and the food was good. That's why they get 3 stars. But the price just doesn't make sense for what you get. I work in the area, and I wish them well, but I am not going to be rushing back there anytime soon..."}
{"text":"This place was cute and eclectic. I got the pulled pork Sammie and my boyfriend got the quesadilla. My sandwich was tasty and his quesadilla was ok. It was well made but I think he preferred my Sammie. The girl up at the front was so sweet and really helpful. She walked around and checked on everybody. She even remembered our name when we were leaving. The fries were bomb and the mac and cheese was good too. It was sweet but good. Oh and the BBQ sauce on the table was tasty as well. Well com back for sure"}
{"text":"If you want real down home comfort food this place is it. I had the brisket and it melted in my mouth. My wife had NC chicken and waffles (like chicken pot pie in a waffle). We fought each other over it. They really made us feel like family, including the kids. I'm glad we found this place before it gets packed."}
{"text":"One of the coolest looking restaurants I've been in. Very unique atmosphere. I felt like I was part of the family. The girl taking the orders started playing with my 4 year old, super nice! The food was outstanding. I got a pulled pork sandwich and my wife got the hillbilly philly. Super delicious! The brown sugar bacon Mac n cheese was great too, my wife didn't like it as much because she said Mac n cheese shouldn't be sweet, but she doesn't know good Mac n cheese... I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Really cool little storefront BBQ/southern.  This guy is a direct descendent of the Hatfield's and all his recipes are handed down through the family.  Fall off the bone ribs and true southern collard greens.  Excellent corn muffins too.  BBQ pork quesadilla had good flavor.   No liquor license but Friday night special events allow you to BYOB. Quick take out or casual order at counter and pickup in the back when the cook hollers your name."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. The experience was rustic and authentic. Loved the food! Everything had a little different touch to it. The place is decorated awesome as well. Friendly staffing, very helpful. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Everything I've had so far has been excellent. Loaded fries and biscuits and gravy are highlights. Best place in west park for breakfast."}
{"text":"Incredible atmosphere with incredible people. Oh and the food is amazing! As a relocated Yankee born here and brought up in NC on piggie, I can tell you this is a spectacular tribute to southern BBQ with a Cleveland flare. The Philly? Slap your momma good!"}
{"text":"That Mac and Cheese!!!!!  Whoever thought to put brown sugar in it is a pure cooking genius!  I could not get enough of it!  Absolutely delicious!    The bread pudding is delightful, so happy I tried it!  The Hillbilly breakfast is a HUGE HIT, as are the biscuits and gravy.    Ken, you're a huge asset to our neighborhood!  As for people bitching about paying $12 for a burger, that's the going rate around here.  Eat at McDonald's next time."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed here. Friendly owners and staff, and food so good, it'll bring a tear to your eye. Personal faves: Devil Anse pulled pork sandwich, the brown sugar mac & cheese, the corn fritters, the hillbilly Benedict, and sweet baby Jesus - THE RIBS. Love Hatfield's."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were in the mood for some BBQ and were hoping to find something different.   I had remembered a good review for Hatfield's on my NextDoor neighborhood website so we decided to give it's take-out a try.   We were not disappointed!   This is good food.  I had the pulled pork dinner and added a side of the brown sugar bacon mac n cheese.  YUM!  The pulled pork was perfect and tender and happily not over sauced like some BBQ places.  The corn fritter was perfect with it!  I loved the potato salad and while my girlfriend loved the coleslaw, I prefer mine spicier....but it was still good.  The sweet twist on the mac n cheese was wonderful.  My girlfriend had the brisket dinner and enjoyed it as well.  Keeping in mind that this was a take-out order, I can imagine that this food fresh out of the kitchen to your table would be even better.  The breakfast sounds incredible!   The place itself looked really cool, albeit lonely for a Saturday night.   So, so glad to have a good Southern-style place nearby....a new go-to!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch, and the food and decor were great.  Stayed for a couple of hours talking to one of the owners, drinking our byob bloody marys, and playing chess.  Cool place."}
{"text":"A unique take on Southern food.  Brick and mortar restaurant owned by a former food truck guy, and I love the way he has the place decorated and set-up...kinda like a house with front living room, dining room, sitting room, etc.  My buddy and I ordered two different sandwiches and split them, so we could try more dishes and sides.  I ordered the Hillbilly Philly with fries and he ordered pulled pork sandwich with brown sugar mac-n-cheese as his side.  The Hillbilly Philly was an unusual concoction of sliced beef, BBQ sauce, cheese, mushrooms all grilled and stuffed into a wrap style tortilla that was also pressed on a grill.  Not sure how much I liked it or not as the flavor profile was quite unexpected as a cross between a barbeque-style sandwich and a traditional Philly cheesesteak.  The BBQ pulled pork sandwich was more traditional in presentation, but really got amped up with their tableside vinegar-based sauce.  As for the sides, the brown sugar mac-n-cheese was too sweet (for my taste) and the cheese sauce was a bit on the liquid side versus a more thickened sauce.  The fries were a bit overdone as well.  All in all I did enjoy the meal...think I need to give it another try before I make a final decision."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this place, you're missing out on a great place to enjoy the BEST 1/2lb. burgers, down home cooking, BBQ, breakfast, lunch and dinner north of the Mason Dixon line! The ambiance and culinary POV is southern comfort on steroids. Self seating, tons of interesting photos, trinkets and memorabilia takes you to the 1800's when times were slower and people were friendlier. They make an effort to get to know you by name. The restaurant is open, but divided into friendly nooks and crannies including couches, tables, church pews complete with a simulated \"front porch\" setting to sit back with friends and family and sip your coffee or other favorite beverages. Non pretentious and welcoming owners Jessica and Ken Hatfield (Ken is an actual direct descendant of The legendary Hatfield's & McCoys), will wow you with their friendly and gracious customer service and passion to please. Stop in and give it a try! You will not regret it. Oh, and make sure to top off your meal with their amazing homemade bacon, gooey, chocolate chip cookie! Mmmm!"}
{"text":"We were walking to the Mexican restaurant and decided to stop here instead and we're so glad that we did. Not only is the decor great, the food is amazing and fresh, even an hour before closing. I will be returning quite often."}
{"text":"Went there looking for something new and different other than the usual places in Lakewood, I won't list since we all know what they are. This place is the bees knees! Didn't know it was originally a food truck before the restaurant but they sure know how to cook a \"Hillbilly Philly\". The CLEVELAND BBQ SAUCE is 10/10...if you like vinegar on your fries & BBQ sauce you'll love drenching your french fries in it like I did!   Would recommend to my friends and loved ones and will be going back for more...you can count on it!"}
{"text":"Amazing Southern comfort food.  The owner is a genuine good guy and the whole staff makes you feel like you are part of the family.  I definitely recommend you give this a try and bring your appetite...your going to need it!!!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this quaint little place is absolutely wonderful. I love the ALA carts menu and the position sizes are great and I loved everything about this place."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. The set-up inside is a bit weird-- you order at register and they will call your name from the back of the restaurant to pick up you food. But the food is insanely good. The burgers are some of the best in the area, the breakfast is fantastic, and the desserts are out of this world. Great spot if you enjoy good food!"}
{"text":"Ordered 10 hillbilly breakfasts in the form of a breakfast burrito (half with bacon, half with sausage).  Heard a range of reviews: \"top five breakfast burritos I've ever had\", \"bomb burrito\", \"best burrito I've ever had.\"    Might want to consider adding the hillbilly breakfast burrito to the menu. Just saying.  They were quick to make and staff was great.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Finally  a place in west park to get great food. I am a big fan of the casual seat yourself and i don't  mind ordering at the register. The pulled pork fries blew my mind amazing combo of flavors and texture. The food prices are fair for the quality of food you receive. The premium  sodas are great to go along with some tasty food. I am super excited to try out ribs and brisket. Thanks for bringing some flavor to west park."}
{"text":"Just flew in to Cleveland and this was close to airport and had good reviews!   Awesome people and great food!!!!!!!!   Recommend it when you're here!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped in for breakfast before she had to go to work. The atmosphere was inviting and casual. She had the cheesy grits, scrambled eggs and a home- made biscuit. I was advised that corned beef was on the menu tonite so corned beef hesh was an option which I opted for along with a couple of over medium eggs.  We were both quite happy. the grits were perfect. The corned beef was smoked as opposed to simmered. The flavor was excellent. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Brisket sandwich with brown sugar bacon Mac and cheese!!!! Amazing sandwich! The service was exceptional! They were out of bacon walnut chocolate chip cookies but they made sure to cook some fresh for us. This place is a must try!!!"}
{"text":"I found Hatfield's on Instagram, and because everything looked amazing, I decided to go. My friend and I had lunch there today, and Hatfield's did not disappoint. They were genuinely welcoming and vocally appreciative of us being there. They were accommodating to our needs, and the food was just as delicious as it looked online. Service means a lot to me, and they definitely went above and beyond. They knew it was our first time there, and management surprised us with a special treat as a thank you. I highly recommend trying this place out. I know I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"We went here about a week ago. My fiancé and his children had been here previously and kept saying how they just had to take me!!  Well, finally they did and I just cannot say enough good things!  The food was absolutely amazing. I had the pulled pork and we split the loaded fries. The potato salad was some of the best ever!  Next, the service!!  Wow!!  Everyone working there was so kind and you could tell they take a lot of pride in their food... which they should!!  They even gave me some bread pudding for dessert since it was my first time there. It was absolutely Devine!!  We are definitely going to use them to cater our future rehearsal dinner. Go to Hatfield's!!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Been here for breakfast and lunch. Pulled pork is amazing! Hatfield hash & the coffee are fantastic too.  Everyone is very friendly and the decor is fun.  Portion sizes are huge so be prepared to be stuffed and still need a box."}
{"text":"I was literally driving out of my work parking lot for lunch to get fast food and a smoothie and there in front is the Hatfield's Goode Grub. What a surprising treat! I ordered the pulled pork dinner. It came with a good portion of smothered pulled bbq pork with a side of coleslaw and potato salad. I happened to be the last customer for the day and the owner gave me free fries! And a lot of them! The pulled pork was good. Seasoned, tender and sauced with bbq just how i like it. I never heard of this food truck but I would like to try other items they have on the menu. Hatsfield's Goode Grub made my lunch break a great one."}
{"text":"Food was great and the service was better. Would highly recommend HATFIELDS to everyone."}
{"text":"My friend & I recently stopped in for lunch.   We quickly learned that you order your drinks & food up front at the bar area, find a seat & then wait for the kitchen staff in back to call out your name when your food is ready.  While we waited we checked out the décor of the restaurant which is like hillbilly chic.  It was a very relaxed atmosphere & comfortable. In no time at all, our order was ready.  My friend had a bowl of soup and cornbread.  She commented that the soup reminder her of something her mother use to make.  I believe it was the featured soup of the day, beef, bacon & mushroom.  She absolutely loved it making sure she got every last drop by using her cornbread to mop up what was left in the bowl.  Speaking of the cornbread....amazing.  It was served warm.  It was buttery, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside with a good crumble.  I had a lunch special of ribs, coleslaw and a side.  I picked the brown sugar mac-n-cheese.  De-Lish! The meat fell off the rib bones, the mac-n-cheese was the best I ever had and the coleslaw had the perfect balance of sweetness and tang.  Since it was our first visit, the owner treated us to a slice of the bread pudding.  Yummy, rich & decadent!  As well as we both enjoyed our meals, I feel one of the best parts of this establishment are the people who work there.  Everyone was super nice & caring.  Ken, the owner, stopped at every table to make sure each guest was pleased.  I will be back again & again to work my way through their menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous breakfast and will be coming back in just a few days to give their dinner offerings a try!"}
{"text":"I couldn't wipe the foodie smile off my face.  By far my new most favorite spot in Cleveland for breakfast.  Owner/chef and staff...superb!  Only thing I regret is eating my food so fast, I forgot to take a pic!"}
{"text":"I have been following Hatfield's since I randomly came upon their food truck last year. So happy they opened a restaurant! The pulled pork is so tender and delicious. The brown sugar bacon mac & cheese is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch. We had the brisket sandwich, pulled pork sandwich, collard greens, Brunswick stew, Mac and cheese. We did not have brunch but should have. The chopped brisket sandwich and pulled pork reheated on the griddle with bbq sauce was not good bbq. It tasted like a manwich. It was pretty disappointing. Next the collard greens had no flavor like they just cooked them in water and they were terrible. The Brunswick stew would have been better if it was out of a can. It tasted and looked pretty bad like it was reheated 4 times. And the Mac and cheese with brown sugar and hot sauce in them had a weird disgusting flavor. Why would you put brown sugar in Mac and cheese? Overall I may come back for brunch as it's hard to screw up eggs but never ever for bbq. It just was bad. And the order at the counter and retrieve your food and clear your own table is also not my style. Spend $4 an hour and hire a server.  I heard mixed reviews on the place and I side on the pretty bad food end of it as far as the bbq goes."}
{"text":"Awesome little place in West Park that has a great atmosphere and great down home cooking food.  Breakfast was great and want to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Some friends from out of town came in for the weekend and I took them to Hatfield's Goode Grub. Let me tell you this restaurant is everything that we were looking for. The chef was a contestant on Chopped the cooking tv show and the food was amazing. There are no servers and you actually get to go to the kitchen yourself to get the food when it's ready! The place is trendy, hip, and local grub to die for!!! Go as soon as you can and you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"This is amazing!  In town on business and my coworkers brought me to try Hatfield's.  OMG!  Seriously best pulled pork ever.  Flavor was outstanding, and combined with coleslaw and pickle on a lightly toasted bun it was ridiculously good.   Mac and cheese was also good, but be ready for a sweet after taste from the brown sugar - first bite and you'll know its not like anything else you've had.  I cant wait to return, and would love if the food truck made long distance trips into Michigan of course!"}
{"text":"This place is so good.  From the ambiance to the laid-back atmosphere. You make your choice and head up to the bar to order. The kitchen calls out when your order is ready and you go pick it up.  My wife loves their sandwiches, especially the corned beef. The hillbilly philly is dynamite and the CLE sauce is legit. You'll enjoy yourself here!"}
{"text":"As a long time resident of westpark, I was delighted when I stopped in to Hatfield's for breakfast one day.  Best breakfast anywhere.  I had the hillbilly breakfast and I added biscuits & gravy.  I get the same thing every time I go there.  The breakfast potatoes are outstanding.  Once you get the hang of the setup (it's not like Denny's) you'll feel right at home.  Ken and his staff are friendly and personable.  The price is a little higher than your average diner but I'm willing to pay a little more for good tasting food.  You get what you pay for.  Haven't tried the lunch or dinner menu items yet but I'm looking forward to trying those soon."}
{"text":"A real treat! Friendly owner-operators, clean and well run truck and as hoped, the food was great! We split the cheesesteak w bacon Mac and the portabella w fries. The Mac disappeared fast and the cheesesteak was banging. I didn't end up getting a bite of the mushroom ;) the fries were perfect."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch before a flight home. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. I'm always looking for a fresh new take on a cheeseburger and they delivered with the Mac & Cheese w/bbq sauce burger. Very tasty!  I was also impressed with the fresh cut French fries. The portions were worth the price paid. If we had one of these locations in Las Vegas I would definitely be a frequent diner."}
{"text":"So. Freakin. Good. Amazing food, reasonable prices and a super friendly staff to boot.  I had two other diners with me and they raved about it too. I hope it sticks around; I will return for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent pulled pork meal, I doused it in the BBQ sauce. Corn fritter just made the meal!"}
{"text":"Heard good things and have been meaning to try this place, so when I found myself in the Kamms neighborhood in Cleveland, I stopped in for lunch.  They have a nice selection of sandwiches and wraps.  I chose the meatloaf sandwich and a side of the bacon brown sugar mac and cheese.  The sandwich was served on 2 fresh pieces of texas toast,  the meatloaf was nice and moist, and was complimented with a tasty sauce.  The mac and cheese was well prepared. I was a little hesitant ordering it because if the brown sugar, but it actually added a nice flavor to the side dish. Yum!  Nice and clean, cool decor....Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Caught this new food truck during Walnut Wednesday the other day.  There was a huge line in front of it, but once I made to the front of that line, the food came out extremely fast.  They have a pretty extensive menu of quick and simple southern-style comfort food.  Had a pulled pork sandwich with a side of bacon mac and cheese.  They were out of cole slaw by the time that I ordered, but even without the cole slaw, the pulled pork sandwich was flavored very well and the meat was sweet and tender.  The mac and cheese was also great - they used shell-shaped pasta rather than your normal macaroni - it was a tad sweet, not overwhelmingly cheesy, with enough little bits of bacon to make you want more of it.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Great burgers with a southern twist! Brown sugar bacon mac and cheese will blow you away. Real sugar soft drinks. Nice people. Chef was on chopped!! Order at the bar. Place is a hidden gem. Prepare for a food coma afterwards. I had the catfish taco wrap with the collared greens. Add the cleveland vinegar sauce to the greens for a kick."}
{"text":"Okay Honey and I stopped in for our first breakfast today, and as usual Ken and crew just killed it! Chorizo Burrito just wonderful and the Biscuits & Sausage Sausage Gravy wonderful as well. Grabbed a cookie to go it was like Walnut Bacon Chocolate Chip Holy Cow was it good. But of course everything is better with Bacon. Top notch service from Megan!!! Don't suppose you'd share the cookie recipe?  First time visit. Ken & his Wife are just a joy. Wonderfully? large space / seating area. Enjoyed Pork quesadilla? toasted to perfection, Brisket & Corned beef dinners with great fries and homemade maple bacon Mac and cheese. Make sure you try the dill wasabi sauce and if you ask Ken has a wonderful Sriracha sauce. Service is just friendly and fast. Don't forget to try the Bread pudding just like Mom made. I hear breakfast here is to die for. That's our next next visit."}
{"text":"I got he blue ridge chicken wrap and it was amazing! My husband loves the pulled pork with lots of their delicious BBQ sauce!"}
{"text":"We've been 4 times now and the food is good, but we really keep coming back for the great atmosphere and friendly staff. From breakfast to pulled pork, food is consistently good, but on the very heavy side in my opinion. I need more veggies in my life and can't find enough of them here! One can not survive on pork alone - although some may argue otherwise and this place may be perfect for you! Not a huge fan of their drink selection or coffee. The set up is a little awkward (order at bar, pick up in the back when the bell rings, are you supposed to clear your own table? You should still tip right? I don't know...awkward set up) and some of the tables look great but are really uncomfortable to actually sit on. Worth a stop to check out of you're in the neighborhood though!"}
{"text":"We looked forward to eating here for a couple of weeks before having a chance to stop in based on positive reviews from other sites.  We stopped in for breakfast with high hopes but quickly had our expectations lowered. The breakfast menu is very limited. So limited that you can't even have toast with your eggs and hash. The food we ordered (Hillbilly Benedict, Hilbilly Breakfast with bacon and eggs over hard, and the gravy and biscuits) were all pretty bland and overall just not that great. With the exception of the hash, that was delicious.  Other complaints are lack of drink options. They did have juice, soda and coffee. But juice at 2.50 for a 8 oz dixie cup was a bit much. And 2.50 for a CAN of soda is ridiculous.  You also seat yourself, walk up and order your food, run to the back and pick up your own food. Then you can bus your own table while you're there as well.  This would all be fine but you pay when you order and they point out the tipping options. I understand the model of having the customer do the work, but to ask for a tip on top of that is not cool. We did tip well but immediately questioned ourselves as to why we did so.  Overall we did not enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"Visiting from Austin Texas where food is awesome!! Had the Hillbilly Philly!  It was awesome and the max& cheese was so good!   Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Love almost everything on this menu! Highly recommend the special for the day (has never been a miss for me especially the jerk chicken!) the only thing I am not a fan of is a petty complaint but you can only order bottled water there, would just the option for a glass of tap.  Staff is amazing especially chef Ken"}
{"text":"Sunday morning looking for brunch, I took to yelp and found this wonderful place. When we walked in, I think you could tell we had never been there because we were slightly thrown off by the sit wherever, order at the bar system. The hostess/cashier was super friendly and welcoming and guided us. The food came out rather quick, and was fantastic at a solid price. They knew we were first-timers so they brought complimentary bread pudding, which was delicious, sweet, and an awesome gesture. We've already scoped out the menu and will be back again!!"}
{"text":"I've come here a lot over the past month. I love BBQ and probably will approve of lesser BBQ than none at all. Since my first review, which was quite glowing, I've been able to get a better sense of the quality. I'm modifying my evaluation. While I think the meats (ribs, brisket, pulled pork) are all generally well prepared and great, some of the sides leave a lot to be desired, and frankly, have compromised what otherwise would have been a great meal.  Let's talk specifics. The French fries are horrible. The first time I had them they were too greasy. The last time they were stone cold. I realize they don't want to waste food, but putting old cold fries on an otherwise good dish only ruins the dish. Perhaps they should cook the fries to order and only drop what you need at any given time. I realize that's a little harder, but the place has never been overrun with customers.  I was likewise disappointed in the cole slaw. Really bland. And the owner is from Carolina, so why not some vinegar slaw? Overall, other than the Brunswick stew, most of the sides are pretty average unless you get them close to when they're first made. I really want this place to make it. I think the BBQ is good. I hope they can work on the sides.  Update: I received a response from the owner, I was impressed by his candor. I really believe he wants to make his restaurant a great spot. He needs to make money and customers need to get value. Based on his response I think he will make it happen. I will continue to support this restaurant. I want WP restaurants to make it. It really is a good spot and I encourage folks to support it. The food is really good. My issues can be easily corrected."}
{"text":"Came in with the family and we wanted to try everything and so we tried a lot. Snuck in 15 minutes before they stopped serving breakfast and ordered a biscuits and gravy to share. Gravy had Good flavor, but the best part was the amazing buttery biscuit   My daughter and I ordered the sloppy Joseph. A full fledged yummy sloppy joe topped with a creamy cole slaw, house made bread and butter pickles and house made pickled jalapeños. You get to pick a side, she chose bacon Mac and cheese and I chose homemade fries. I prefer a crispier fry but the flavor profile was good and my daughter enjoyed the Mac and Cheese My son chose the fued'n burger minus the coleslaw. He enjoyed his burger as did my husband who chose the shroomy burger which says it all. My husband also had a bowl of tomato soup. He wasn't as happy with the smoked flavor of the soup but I felt it was good.   We left full and happy with our choices. We even ordered a slice of apple pie to share but our eyes were bigger than our tummy's and alas we had to bring it home.   A tip.. you order up front at the counter, seat yourself and pick up your food in the back. Definitely stop by to check it out yourself."}
{"text":"The food, atmosphere and people are warm and welcoming. Down home cooking that is delicious and filling. You're family here."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Great BBQ sauce and the mac n cheese was out of this world. The burger I ordered was huge and I only finished half. This is a very unique little place with lots of cool antiques inside. Staff was very friendly and everything was really clean. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Don't go into Hatfield's if you're keen on counting calories. With that out of the way, Hatfield's is a great spot if you want some seriously good food. It's transitioned from a food truck to a physical establishment really well.   The environment is low-key and the food is always good. I'm a big fan of their brunch options. I'm not really an omelet gal, but I could never turn down one of their pulled-pork masterpieces. Stop by if you're craving BBQ!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was cool. But u pay alot of money for no service. U place ur own orders like a food truck but ur in a restraunt. 13 bux for a wrap. Not worth it"}
{"text":"Had brunch here today with a group. Loved the decor and the concept. I had the Hillbilly Breakfast and it was well worth it. The sausage gravy over the potatoes was a really nice touch. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"I am a business traveler and am on the road every week eating at amazing places. I got the opportunity to sit down with the owner and his wife on a slow Wednesday and had an amazing meal. The corn beef and cabbage was incredible! I will be back every time I come to town, and I look forward to trying everything else they have to offer. PS if you go, you had better get a cookie. Holy shit!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend has been eyeing this place for weeks so we finally decided to try it out. This place is definitely not your normal restaurant but I absolutely love the originality. You go up order and pay and wait for your names to be called and grab your food from the chef in the back. Everyone seemed very friendly and one of the cooks came out to make sure we enjoyed the food. I got the Mac-n-Cheese Burger and it was amazing. The brown sugar in the mac-n-cheese, the bits of bacon, the barbecue sauce and ranch all paired with the burger, it was phenomenal. My boyfriend got the Hillbilly Breakfast and he absolutely loved it, I of course had to try his potatoes with the gravy topping. I can honestly say that is the best sausage gravy that I've had at a restaurant. Portions were very generous, I ate half my berg and too the other half to go. I have to also say the decorations were all very interesting, my favorite was Kyrie being eaten, definitely gave me my laugh for the day. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere was great!  Food was bad. I'm from the south and this is NOT southern cooking. The pulled pork was tough meatloaf was full of garlic. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Another great find on yelp! Went for brunch last Saturday. I ordered a mushroom and Swiss omelette. It came with a delicious potato hash. Hubby got the grits, eggs, and bacon. Everything was cooked perfectly. Coffee was also very good."}
{"text":"OMG the smother fries are amazing. You have to try  them. We had them with pork. My husband had the corn beef sandwich. I had the brisket sandwich. Both were great. Both were smoked to perfection."}
