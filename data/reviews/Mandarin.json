{"text":"All-round, excellent takeout! The dishes are very well-prepared and the boxes are full of what you may order; no skimping. The quality of the food is like that of sit-down restaurants and the service was spot-on. Without a doubt, I can definitely say that I'll be carrying out again."}
{"text":"Absolutely filthy restaurant. Made the mistake of moving one of the tables an inch while waiting for food, and there were mouse droppings underneath. Young girl taking orders was very unpleasant, obviously there because her parents force her to work. Food took forever, had no flavor, egg rolls were burnt. Prices were very high. Was told they had no ice, after I paid for, and was given, a warm bottle of water. Go anywhere but here."}
{"text":"I wish I could give lower then a star. I called this restaurant 5 times and each time the lady would say yes they deliver and she would get my order then tells me to hold and hangs up! Never even getting my address! Horrible service. 

Then because I was tired of them doing the hang up game on me, I went to the restaurant. They acted like their phone orders were not important. So when I asked to speak to the manager, they said they weren't around. 

I ordered my food to at least hoping the food would be decent for their lack of service. I was wrong. -3 stars."}
{"text":"Hmm well I'm not a fan of buffet food, but my fianc√© loves mandarin, so for his birthday I figured I'd give it a try. 

Well, like I said I don't like buffet food so I wasn't fond of the food, but the service was excellent. Better than all of the buffets I've visited. Your plates are always removed quickly, and the waiters/waitresses are always at your service so you're not waiting a long time to get your drink refilled, or order a new drink.

So for people who love buffets, this would be a great place for you."}
{"text":"good food and quality service..if you don't want in a wait list come early specially weekends!"}
{"text":"Was here a few weeks ago. It's a great location, very close to Kennedy subway station [/applicable bus routes]. Happily, I was here with family and not the work group I usually go to Mandarin locations with. Having eaten at almost all their locations, the thing I love most about Mandarin is that the food is always consistently delicious."}
{"text":"this mandarin had the best selection of desserts ive ever seen at a mandarin. i was impressed, im a dessert lover."}
{"text":"Person behind the counter rolls her eyes when you order (she's a teenage daughter of an owner maybe), like she's doing you a favor, because she would rather play on her phone which she goes right back to after she takes your order. The food takes forever even when it isn't busy, front and what you can see of the back is dirty, and after all that, food is terrible. 

See photo of my \"pepper steak\" which was 90% onions (the cheapest ingredient), 5% peppers and 5% beef. Sauce had no flavor, either. Fried rice likely not even made on site, but purchased as a fried rice mix. Save your money. AVON NEEDS a decent Chinese place, and I'm sure the only reason this place is still open is because there is literally no competition within 10-15 minutes."}
{"text":"Great delivery service!! Yay! We had the chicken fried rice.. Spicy & sesame chicken! Will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Most people yelping about Mandarin seem to have one major complaint - that this place is not genuine Chinese food. I see this as a case of misinformation and over expectation. 90% of \"Chinese\" buffets in North America serve an eclectic collection of Chinese, Japanese and North American food. This is also the reason for their major success - you get almost anything you want to eat, for incredibly low prices.

So lets get this out of the way first....YES. Mandarin is just a typical North American Chinese buffet. If you want authentic chinese fare, you are reading about the wrong restaurant. But that being said, Mandarin is also one of the better buffet places you'll find in Toronto. 

The location on Eglington-Birchmount is quite convenient for East Torontonians (is that what we are called?) and people in Scarborough. The parking space is decently big, and Mandarin customers get free parking for 3 hours. (which should be more than enough, and if it's not, I worship thy eating capabilites.) TTC buses stop right at the door too.

The interior is pleasant and the waiters look sweet in their bright green beach themed shirts. The service was quite good, considering how packed the place was when we arrived. First timers also get a tour of the entire spread.

The salad bar is pretty extensive, and the surimi salad is to die for. There are enough fried things to keep the calorie lover busy. Most people don't trust the sushi at buffets, but I noticed these guys didn't have any raw ones. The fried chicken teriyaki sushi was edible, and die hard sushi fans won't mind filling themselves with that. Apart from a lot regular chinese dishes, you will also find roast beef, pizza and grilled sausages!

The desserts are good too, and definitely worth saving enough space. The blueberry cheesecake was a bit stiff, but the caramel custard and the lemon meringue pie were just delicious. You can also give those almond cookies a try. To end it all, there are 7 or 8 different ice creams to choose from. (including low cal sherbets, although somehow coming to a buffet and looking for low cal food doesn't add up!).

I took away one star because of the noisy children running around and the slightly disappointing blueberry cheesecake.

The bottom line? Definitely a must try place for people who love a lot of food, of decent quality, for a fair price. Food snobs who are looking for \"authentic chinese\" can stay away. 

P.S: Like most buffet places, the lunch is cheaper on weekdays, and the dinners on weekends are the most expensive. But you also get shrimp cocktail and crab legs on weekends!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed my time at Mandarin. Pretty consistent quality over the years. Some plus and minuses for this location. The others I've been to were in Mississauga, Newmarket and YongeEglinton. I missed the grilled shrimp in particular and found that the buffet was somewhat lacking in seafood. At the end of the day, worth it for the yummy crab on the weekends in my opinion. Once in a while anyways. You may get bored if you were to go every week."}
{"text":"Every Mandarin is a unique experience. But, this one is very special. The guys working there takes it to a much personal level, that you feel at home!"}
{"text":"Great food and good service. The drinks are especially nice. Order the Mango Mango."}
{"text":"This restaurant will fit the bill for your average Chinese take out. Not bad, but certainly not the best Chinese place around here if I am willing to drive 10 more minutes for a carryout. We carry out from there twice a month, When we don't wanna make dinner and we don't want to drive far And we don't want to carryout pizza."}
{"text":"This is actually my favourite mandarin location in all of Toronto. Best selection of amazing food,great seating, and exceptionally friendly staff. Also great with time management. Everytime I come here no matter the day or time I always have a great experience."}
{"text":"I have been to 2 different locations. I went there both with my co-workers. I like their food, the chicken wings were very fresh. The selection was large and I was very happy with them. I don't like the decoration of the restaurant, but the staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"This is the precipice of chinese buffets. This particular location has been my go-to for years. 

The minute you walk in you see their beautiful setup. Always book ahead as their is always a wait no matter what. 

Each year theyve added something new, the cotton candy machine for ex. Their selection is what you would expect. For a $19.99 lunch on a weekend is reasonable, however $26.99 for dinner is so-so imo. Have fun reading your fortunes stuffed."}
{"text":"That familiar feeling...

Mandarin has been a big crowd favorite, if one would ask a diner on the prowl with a group or a family out in Scarborough, the appeal is made quite evident and rightfully so, there's a fair bit of attention that goes into the food.

The favorite repasts are all here, fluffy, meaty, golden crisp on the outside chicken balls to that fried rice that reminds you of that beautiful ambiguity of the dishes through the ages and continents. The fried chicken, if you get it when it's just put out, is wonderful!

The salmon dish was not that bad, I tend to not crave salmon every once in a while, however on an occasion that it was served, I did try it. It goes fast, so while you're contemplating it, it will run out or get dry. The \"tempura\" shrimp is one of the nicest offering here, you can tell that they pay close attention, no underdone shrimp in deep fried coating here, nor did I find rubbery, overcooked shrimp.

A must have, at this location is the chicken curry. It shows a great level of restraint, there are nice tones of lemon and coconut in there, the chicken is cooked rather well and there's not too much of any ingredient to spoil it, that alone keeps me coming back. Consistency of the curry from visit to visit is sometimes spotty with salt balance (some times it's perfect, some times it's lacking a bit) however the act of adding the Spicy Eggplant to it on your plate more than makes up for it.

Let's speak of the staff at this location, they are the friendliest I've found at any chain restaurant I've come across in Ontario. Empty drinks refreshed and empty plates were removed at the right pace, max time for an empty plate was 10 seconds, well staffed! They're a friendly bunch, Mr. Bai is a wonderful manager, you can find him working front staff or helping waiters out on the floor, rather inspiring. 

Of course, there are gripes, during crab leg offerings, if your timing does not coincide with the refresh time, you might find yourself waiting, a major put off.  The aforementioned shrimp, they should be replenished as soon as possible, an empty buffet pan is not a good sight, especially when it lasts over 20 minutes. 

There we have it, four stars, if the replenish issue is dealt with, this restaurant might just be the \"Juggernaut of Scarborough\""}
{"text":"Their delivery is awful- they said on the phone it would take 15-20 minutes and an hour and a half later they still had not come!! This seems to happen every time  I order from them- tip- go somewhere else"}
{"text":"I drove an extra five minutes to this restaurant for takeout, because of the positive Yelp reviews. I regret having done so. One dish, Szechuan chicken, was fine. But the other, cashew chicken, tasted as if it had been cooked in old oil. It was very heavy and greasy. Overall, the food was below average for Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"For years we only went to this restaurant on special occasions. The cost was really the deciding factor, too expensive for everyday. So a few months ago we decided to try their take out and delivery service.
We are hooked! The value for the money is excellent. We get dinner for  three for around $40.00 and there is plenty leftover for lunch the next day.
We try new dishes once in awhile but have a set menu we tend to stick to. For our money we usually get 5 dishes....something for everyone!
The food arrives hot, and usually within an hour of placing the order. The delivery staff is efficient and friendly.
We always get a chuckle out of the fortunes in our cookies....very odd and preachy sayings.....
I recommend you give the delivery service a try. Same great food for much less cost."}
{"text":"The service is, by far, the best I've experienced in any buffet. We've been visiting this location for the last few years, and the only complaint I have is that as of recently, my family and I have not been able to eat as much as we used to eat. I've talked to other people I know about this, and we suspect excessive use of MSG, which causes food to feel more filling. Other than that, no complaints. There's plenty of variety, and the food is of a very diverse range."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Super friendly staff!  Met Jakie Kong the Managing Partner and made us feel very welcomed and ensured that we were satisfied with the food and service."}
{"text":"Decor - This eatery is mainly designed for take out. They do have a couple of tables, but they weren't clean.

Service - The waitress/cashier/cook was polite, when taking my order. However her co-worker, who was next to her, was on the phone and made loud remarks throughout my time there.

Food - I ordered one of the tofu dishes. I was extremely disappointed with all aspects of the dish. The tofu had a tough outer exterior, like it had been fried and stored for a day or two. The sauce had a very fermented bean taste, which didn't compliment the tofu or the vegetables. Lastly, the rice had an odd odor, when tasted by itself.

Overall - Feels and tastes like a low-end chinese take-out. I won't be visiting here again."}
{"text":"If your looking for a cheap, buffet and North Americanized Chinese food this is the place to go. Large Selections from Appetizers to desserts. Good for the family, good service! The waiters are always attentive in refilling my glass and getting rid of my dirty plates. The only part i do not like about this is that they usually put a slice of lemon in my glass of water but this is just a minor problem. I usually go to the Mandarin at least once every 4 months."}
{"text":"I have been in this location only twice. (I have been in other locations as well) The first time was almost 2 year and it wasn't good as I expected. The second time was just few days ago.. I could say \"I love it!\" I feel like they have more choices and especially Crab!! We had to make a reservation bcoz it was very busy at the time. Service was good. They greeted us very nice and most of them was friendly. There was one guy always came to check us and filled up our water. Thank you for ur caring :) Unfortunately, they didn't have good sauce for seafood. I love spicy and sour sauce that goes very well with seafood stuff. I hope they will have it in the future.
I would return for seafood and dessert ^^"}
{"text":"My first-ever review for Mandarin, despite many visits over many years...
Certainly the best of the canadian-chinese buffets in Toronto, offering an inconsistent range of dishes ranging from truly horrific sushi, to typical freezer-to-fryer fare like panko shrimp and deep fried scallops, to very good dishes including their spicy chicken, bbq ribs, batter-fried fish, deep fried wings, prime rib of beef, and crisp airy freshly made waffles.

My most recent visit left me very disappointed in the sad \"holiday special\" dry roast turkey with truly weird-sweet transparent cornstarch gravy as well as the hot crab legs which were puny, overcooked dry, and grey-fleshed.  The cold crab, also much smaller legs than ever before, was acceptable in favour, yet still not up to par compared to recent years.

Overall, there were plenty of solid dishes to enjoy, great service, and I got my money's worth, but do something about the sushi, crab legs and turkey or Mr. Owner, contact me and I'll teach you how to roast a turkey and make proper turkey gravy. ;-)"}
{"text":"Not bad. This was my 1st and only experience with this place.  It was mediocre. I ordered the hot and spicy chicken and it was okay, but nothing to get excited about. If you're in the mood for some Chinese and happen to be passing by, give it a shot. Just don't expect it to be your new favorite Chinese take out spot."}
{"text":"Mandarin is a typical ayce buffet so didn't have high expectations. It does have a large selection of dishes on the menu. Haven't had the prime rib though, maybe a new addition to the menu! They stop serving sushi after a certain time so watch out for that. Food is okay if you are more into quantity. Lunch felt little cheaper and so more value than dinner. Ambience is good though with lots of sitting places. I say you can enjoy a nice meal here. Also enough parking in front. Recommended."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I been to Mandarin.  The quality of food have gone down from 20 yrs ago.  I would say....this is by far the worst visit I've ever had of Mandarin.  I found a strand of hair on my black forest slice....literally as I cut a piece from my fork and pulled it up....long black fine hair pulled away with my fork.   Completely,  lost my appetite."}
{"text":"If you want good Chinese and friendly service, go to Little Hong Kong in North Ridgeville.  As far as Mandarin is concerned, ordered sweet and sour chicken....all breading, little chicken.  Ordered cashew chicken, chicken and cashews burnt ....not edible.  The garlic chicken is tasty and spicy but 1 good entree out of 3 is not good.  And why are the employees so rude and indifferent?  I really want to like Mandarin because it is close to my home but the quality of food and service are deteriorating."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst establishment I've been to in a long time the food was subpar, never had water until the second plate of food I endured, not only that but my water was room temperature because they rushed it out of a tap without it even getting cold first, I literally could have gone to the imperial buffet across the street and had a WAY better selection of food, service, and atmosphere, the only reason I ate at the Mandarin was because it was right beside me.
--
DO NOT EAT HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO PAY $30 AND BE THOROUGHLY DISAPPOINTED.
--
I eat out all the time, and this is one place I will never be returning to again.. very unfortunate."}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese food you can find in the Avon/Westlake area.  Everything you would expect from any Chinese food place (quick, enormous menu, great hours) plus high quality food, prepared attentively.  I've never had a bad meal there.  And I've ordered between $7 and $50 worth of food and it's always been ready in 10 minutes.  Great location too."}
{"text":"Sure, it's mostly western or westernized Chinese fare (there's not one sign in Chinese anywhere so it's expected) and there's occasionally a slightly dirty plate, but the food is consistently fresh and just about the best I've experienced of the old-school steam-tray self-serve buffets... this genre can't match the made-to-order sit-down AYCEs that are the new normal of course, but it was/is certainly (very) enjoyable. Everything I tried with one exception was good to excellent, although the sushi is sort of meh and could use some more variety."}
{"text":"Lots of good food choices, even though i get only one piece each menu my plate gets full, friendly staff, i loved their decoration.  lots of customers and on our way out one staff handling mints and  thats nice.  Definitely will be back when i'm in town."}
{"text":"First off, I LOVE Mandarin and their food. Our waiter was really nice and friendly, his name is Eric. He kept refilling my water all throughout my stay which was a great attentive touch, as well. My spoon on the other hand is disgusting (I have a picture posted to my review of it)!! It looks like burnt chicken or charcoal that can be scraped off - BARF! My niece's spoon was also dirty. A lot of us at my table asked for disposable cutlery. 

The food on the other hand was amazing as always. I had the breaded shrimp, the mixed vegetables, sushi, Cesar salad, vegetable fried rice, Shanghai noodles, crab legs, pizza and salmon fillet, all of which were great (except the fries as they were on the cold side). For dessert I had fresh fruit, bread pudding (amazing), creme br√ªl√©e, rice pudding and lemon cake. No complaints there either! 

Two staff members sang happy birthday to my sister, gave her a little piece of cake with a candle to blow out, and printed out a complimentary picture in a magnet frame. 

All in all, I had a great time and would've rated 5 stars if it weren't for the dirty cutlery."}
{"text":"Nothing has changed but!!!!
But!!!!!
You can now get a free meal on your birthday! You have to sign up at least a day before. I just thought someone would like that info because I wish I would have had it before I went."}
{"text":"Tried Mandarin again after a couple years, and things have improved greatly. Their pot stickers appear to house-made and are very good. Lo Mein was good too, as was their Hot and Spicy Beef. One oddity -- their Cashew Chicken comes with pieces of deep fried chicken, which I've never had but was still pretty good."}
{"text":"Cheap, huge portions, fast, and pretty darn yummy."}
{"text":"Grabbed some take-out on a Monday night.  It was after 8:00, so the place wasn't busy (as expected).  I noticed as I walked in that there was a table with dirty dishes, etc...only one other customer waiting on an order, and a young girl watching her iPad who was working the register.  Not sure why no one had cleaned up the table with the place not terribly busy, but I was hoping the food would be good regardless.

Nope.  I should've heeded more attention to the red flags I observed on my way in.  I ordered the General Tso's w/white meat and an egg roll.  The \"chicken\" was pathetically over-breaded, and the pieces of meat inside were tiny.  The egg roll was overdone.  A complete disaster of a meal.

Still looking for a good Chinese restaurant in the Avon area..."}
{"text":"Mandarin is a popular buffet choice with our friends especially during special occasions. 

We were here to celebrate a birthday, but they didn't have enough seating to accommodate our group; management was quick to fix the problem. I was very impressed on how the staff handled our large group. We were warmly greeted by the wait staff and there was always someone available to attend to our needs. Water was frequently topped off and dirty dishes promptly removed. On the way out, we were all thanked and given a complimentary pink mint from a pretty glass bowl.

Food was ok, typical of an ayce Chinese buffet; however, their baked salmon with teriyaki sauce was a standout.

My only complaint? Their gaudy, over-the-top decor."}
{"text":"Its a buffet, loads of choices, food is ok, keeping in mind its a buffet.  Not the cheapest dinner 

Great for kids, super selection!"}
{"text":"Sometimes it's hit or miss. Definitely not going there for authentic food. Just lots of it. Only worth it if you're into crab legs and shrimps (weekends)."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to this location for years and have always loved it.  That said, I haven't been to this location for well over a year (at least, it could even be two years), until recently.  I went once end of October and again yesterday and did enjoy the food while I was there, however, both times I left feeling ill (and no, it wasn't because I stuffed myself silly).  I don't know if they have changed the way they prepare/present the food in terms of cleanliness or proper food safety, but both times had me in the washroom the rest of the day.

Sadly, the only way I will return is if it is for a family event where I cannot say no to an invite. 

Maybe I will try the Markham location since that one seems to have good reviews."}
{"text":"I am updating my review as I gave them a few tries again and they improved a little. I still have to ask them not to burn my egg rolls which is a little annoying but if that's what I have to do to get egg rolls that are not hard as a rock then so be it. The daughter who works there is still not the most polite but at least she is not ignoring me while in here phone the past few times. The good is usually good for your standard Chinese take out. I like the general Tsaos chicken, sweet and sour chicken, boneless spare rib and my wife loves the chicken and broccoli."}
{"text":"Should have checked online before just going. I did not find the staff rude or unfriendly just the food to be very uneventful and bland. I love a good noodle soup and I thought it was pretty hard to get wrong but I think they forgot to had the flavor it was boiled water with veggies and various meat pieces. The shrimp needed to be deveined. Side of rice was just dumped on a paper plate. Ended up spending like 13$ for soup steamed rice and a can of coke. Was really disappointed in this meal. I will go back and give them another shot with something else but so far this is not looking good"}
{"text":"Compared to other locations, i.e. the Yonge st one, it is much better, more variety I believe, and easier to find different foods. Staff are very friendly, However I think the desert table here is not as complete as the other brances"}
{"text":"Good food, terrible terrible customer service on the phone. You basically have to do their job for them. The delivery person delivered the food to the wrong hotel because they failed to ask which one. There was no thank you or goodbye when hanging up, and the lady needs a little training on phone etiquette.  Again, food is good for what it is but the service makes it a bad experience, at least for delivery."}
{"text":"I come for crab legs and this location is one of the best because the buffet is well stocked. I have no problem finding claw pieces - my favourite! 
The waitress Wendy didn't want to bring crackers- after asking her several times, se brought one set for my table of two. The last time I came here, she was the waitress then too - would only bring one set for our table of 3! She isn't very attentive and wasn't really concerned about getting dirty plates off the table. 
No waffles in this dessert bar- but thats okay. There was lots to choose from, including chocolate covered BACON!!! Never saw that before- ever ! 
Overall, it was a good experience. This is one of the better locations that I've been to.  Will definitely be coming back for those crab legs... just may consider coming with my own cracker to avoid Wendy's sneer."}
{"text":"I am in awe of this truly bizarre interaction I just had with the staff after ordering delivery and receiving the wrong thing. When my things arrived I sat down to eat and noticed the chow mein I ordered was actually chop suey and the sweet and sour chicken I ordered was a pile of soggy mush (I am not being dramatic) that had clearly been sitting out for some time. I called the restaurant to let them know my order was wrong and inedible, I was put on hold for an extended period of time and that confused me because this isn't rocket science, If you gave me the wrong order all you have to do is apologize and send me another one. After being on hold the person who took my order asked me 3 times what I meant when I ordered chow mein???  Then got the manager the manager answered the phone and proceeded to argue with me that chow mein is chop suey and told me to read the menu again....?  im sitting with chop suey in front of me! And when I told him about the absolutely disgusting chicken he told me there was nothing wrong with it I just don't like their food. I grew up in Scarborough just blocks from this Mandarin I have been going to that specific Mandarin my whole life. I know what sweet and sour chicken is supposed to be and I know what chow mein is. So Now instead of just sending over CHOW MEIN and a fresh order of chicken he insinuated that I had eaten the food (the food that just arrived at my house 5 minutes ago)  and that I was looking for a free meal and that they would come pick up the food before they refund me?  I seriously just wanted what I ordered I never said a thing about a refund... Just what I ordered.  Now I have to wait 5 business days at least to see the refund. And I have to order my dinner from some place else. I am completely confused and rather irritated by this."}
{"text":"Definitely not one of our preferred Mandarin.
The noise level is too high, the food is just marginally ok, the service and servers are not among the best.... Well, we tried it, but probably not going there again."}
{"text":"All in all I loved the food.  Good price and service is ok too.
Great Atmosphere for families with kids. And a wonderful Place for Groups too. 
it is always busy so book table in advance it won't cost You a thing."}
{"text":"Ok, compared to the imperial Buffet this was ten times better. Yes it was a bit  pricey, but the service was fantastic and the food was so good I ended up going back three times. The place was clean and very professional looking, a place that you wouldn't be ashamed of going too. Even the crowd of people that were there seemed of a higher class of people compared to the Imperial."}
{"text":"I've been to this Mandarin Buffet many times with friends and family before.  I've always noticed that the service is really good considering it's a buffet.  The staff are friendly and they say the simple things like \"enjoy your meal\" or wave at you as you leave.

The servers clear off your plate quickly and refill napkins and tea without us even asking!

The food, well it's a regular Chinese buffet food.  They have a really good dessert/fruits area, which a lot of buffets seem to lack.  They have a sushi area, which I never go to but it's there.  The only thing they're missing is probably a soft-serve ice cream machine and a dim sum area.

Lunch is 13.99, it's such a great value.  I don't see any reason not to go here, even if you were on a diet, their fruits and veggie section is pretty damn good."}
{"text":"Ordered my dinner asked for crab ragoon got home and got fried beef wonton. Called back and wanted a future credit was told I could get half off my crab next time. We were not happy with that at all then the lady said we will make it now If you come and get it. Just poor customer service and the beef wonton was burnt and tasted terrible. This business is just going down hill."}
{"text":"The food is good and I really appreciate how the owner walks around at times and asked the customers personally how their visit is going. Great customer service."}
{"text":"No flavor, not clean, and not trying to get better. Avon deserves a better Chinese place than this. I am totally mystified how anyone could give this place more than two stars on their best day. Go anywhere else."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN BY THE HELATH DEPARTMENT!!!
I have never seen a more disgusting unsanitary restaurant in my life.. where do I start??? 
Filthy floors , rusted table stands, bugs on the wall, open toilet with poop stains right between the dining area and kitchen, filthy salt and pepper shakers with yellow crust, no napkins, soy sauce bottles are so dirty I wouldn't pick them up, I asked for a bottle of siracha and she handed me a siracha bottle with a watery brown rotten substance inside.
The rude counter girl acts like she hates working and the customers are interrupting her. she has a huge Canker sore on her lip. 

 I sat there for 35 minutes waiting for my food listening to the mother and father cooks yelling angrily at each other the entire time..  I was literally going insane listening to them.  
You eat with bent or melted plastic forks  and styrofoam plates.
 I ordered General Tsaos chicken and could only manage to get down two bites before throwing it all out.. it was tiny pieces of batter floating in a gallon of a gel like substance. 
a complete waste of money.. I wouldn't eat there if someone gave me $100.00 per bite.. I've never been so disgusted and angry at the complete lack of care and quality.  These people are complete pigs and should be put out of business!!!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for what seems like a thousand years.
It's consistent, always has good choices, always fresh. You always leave fuller than you wanted to in the first place.
I always lament the price but in the end i always over indulge.
So it always turns out to be good"}
{"text":"I'd been going to Mandarin since I was a child. Although I have been to almost all locations in the GTA, I must say that this location has always been a favourite.

I never expect much from buffets, as almost all that I have ever been to have been displeasing, however, Mandarin has always been my favourite!

The food is fresh and plentiful with many varieties. Sometimes there is a variance in quality of food, which I assume is affected by how busy the restaurant is (and it is typically very busy).

For the amount of food you eat, and the above average buffet quality, Mandarin is always a treat.

Of course, you cannot expect fancy, over the top fare here. But for affordable and good food, you cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"This is one of the better ones I've been to, however the bar is pretty low that's set by this chain, and  considering how many colleagues I have that come out of this place complaining of food poisoning, I cant say that things are a whole lot better. Personally, I've never had any issues here, since I stay away from the fish/shrimp at all buffets without exception 

The buffet area is pretty clean (or so it seemed), for some empty chaffing dishes you can see the layers of grease congealed, I've seen some people just discard other stuff they didn't want back into the pans and just steered clear of them. It's not so much the staffs fault here as it is the patrons who are pretty lousy with their bad habits that leads to some nasty things. If it was a bit more conscious about the cleanliness it would be a solid 4/5. Also, it maybe a good idea to skip the fish/shrimp."}
{"text":"The restaurant isn't the cleanest, but the kitchen does look clean. I have not yet met the teenage daughter that is talked about on Yelp, but the older woman was very nice and friendly! She even helped us customize a dish due to allergens. The food was very good, fresh, well cooked and seasoned, and a huge portion. The meat was as plentiful as the much-cheaper vegetables. She even gave us some fortune cookies that were the best I've ever had. I would recommend not eating in the place, the tables are old. Order takeout, and drive down to Panera's patio (1 min drive), or eat at home if the weather isn't nice. We will visit again."}
{"text":"A chain. A cornucopia. Of mostly mediocre food of every kind.
Unless you are √ºber picky you will find something that you will like.
The servers are not that great... But this is a self serve place.
The prices change with the time of day so pay attention. Dinner is not cheap."}
{"text":"Mandarin meh, I've grown and matured in taste preferences but Mandarin has not. 

I've come to the understanding what Mandarin is it's mass produced passable Chinese food, that if it wasn't for friends I would not go."}
{"text":"We arrived at 235pm for lunch. We took an Uber in order to get here.  We were promptly told that it closes at 3, which at that time all the food would be removed. 

Not quite getting the brusque attitude, we asked to speak to the manager. Spoke with Alex. He said the same, in fact said that most of the food is empty anyway as they haven't been filling it in anticipation of closing. 

I'm sorry but the attitude sucks! He didn't even care. If you get there before 3 keep the food until people are done just don't refill. That's logical. Not impressed with his reaction or lack of empathy."}
{"text":"Mandarin is an all you can eat buffet, do I definitely wouldn't recommend going here if you can't eat a lot. They have a good variety of different foods to eat. It's also a great places to bring childish they have a cotton candy, and frozen yogurt machine. They have things for vegetarians as well, I absolutely adore their mango chow and dessert section. This location is very big, great to hold family outings. It isn't the best nor worst location. Though they are Bery clean and well organized, staff is friendly and helpful. Will be returning in the near future."}
{"text":"I moved my office to Avon (until I then moved my office to Akron) and I order take out I would say on average at least once a month from them now,  but it seems like once every two weeks; but I can go on a run of every day sometimes for a couple days.   In the harshest winter of this year they were still delivering to my home in Avon which I really appreciated.  The food has always been great.  And its clearly great quality and I have never had a bad dish.  The menu is big too.   You can get deliver in a pretty big local area but you can always pick up too.  Its not a place for a sit down dinner really but you can sit if you needed to.  Its at one of the entrances to Avon Commons (near 83 and I -90 or 83 and Detroit Rd.) so you can order and pick up on the way home from shopping and its close to other shopping (Marks), and drug stores (CVS) and banks (First Merit; Huntington; Key) ; plus others one more block away.   This has replaced China Wok as my go to Chinese place but because I don't work in the Chinese Wok (Westlake) area anymore physically."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd Mandarin I've been to recently... LOL sounds like I'm a glutton, but that's not why.
Previous to this location, we were at the Mississauga location and Markham.
the service here does not compare to Markham. \"what service'? you may ask for buffet.. there is a difference, believe me. I'm 'one of those' that service is super high on my priority list when it comes to restos. 
So, at this location, it was during the week, so no crab legs (sob), but I have to say the food seems to be pretty consistent from one Mandarin to another. Ok everyone, let's look at buffet for what it REALLY is. I personally don't go to buffet for 'quantity', and this case, I go for the crab legs. At this loc, it was during the week. It was good, nothing was horrible. I've found that all the food is pretty freshly made. Out of the stir fry items, I think the chicken curry is pretty good.
The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because the service.. (the 'attitude') was just ok.  I also think this location feels a bit dated, feeling a bit dumpy.  I would go back here if I was in the area and other people wanted to go, but I would waaay prefer to go to Mississauga for food, presentation - for Markham, it's a tiny bit dated too, but the service - outstanding. In Markham, the manager came around to every table and pretended like he knew you and asked if everything was ok. Great PR! If a place acts like they actualy CARE if I liked my meal, I'm coming back
PS - yes there's way more 'lo fan' food here than other 'Chinese' buffets, but cleanliness and service rank higher for a \"Chinese' buffet. I want the real thing, I'll go to the hole in the wall where my Chinese bros and sis's line up outside the door"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that I have gone to over several years.  It has been consistently terrific each time except for once.  I complained about the bad service and the manager made an extra special effort to make up for it.  Kudos to him for making it better!  We recently went for a birthday celebration and they keep changing things to make the place fun and exciting.  We had cotton candy!  It was so fun and made us feel like kids again!  The buffet is always terrific and the trays are consistently refilled.  I do love this restaurant and am so pleased they take pride in what they do."}
{"text":"Very good takeout!  The ingredients are vey fresh and the dishes well prepared.  AND, they don't skimp-- you will not get a box full of bok choy and onions with one lonely little cocktail shrimp!  

The staff is polite, friendly and helpful.

Anything labeled spicy will be mildly spiced, so if you want hot, ask for it."}
{"text":"I have been warned by some that this Mandarin wasn't great, however I had a good experience here. It close to the subway station, and parking is free up to 3 hours (Mandarin staff will stamp your parking pass). 

I went on a Wednesday about 1pm, and the foyer was packed! I was surprised that a wednesday afternoon will be so busy, but the buffet price is cheaper at this time. 

Drinks were refilled and empty plates were whisked away quickly. In most buffets you shouldn't expect the food to have the best quality but I did enjoy the food. There was a good amount of selection to choose from, Everyone at the table had something to eat. The best part for me was the dessert. Lots of dessert including ice cream, frozen yogurt and cotton candy.

I would come back again!"}
{"text":"Decent dishes but amazing service as the waiter always came to us. The dishes were better before but now they are just average. My favourites here are the crusted fried shrimp, pecan pie and fried fish."}
{"text":"Typical Chinese buffet, but below average cleanliness and staff hospitality.  Great variety of good food, but after asking for clean cutlery twice and still finding sticky/crusty/stained spoons, we finally asked for some to-go plastic cutlery.  Several \"clean\" plates also were none too clean.   Staff was indifferent at best--not rude, just.... there.  Dessert selection was better than most buffets.  They had a really nice creme brulee and several others we enjoyed.  If I was rating food alone, easily a 4."}
