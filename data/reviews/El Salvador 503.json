{"text":"Ayer estuve en este restaurante, yo no lo conocía y el cual ya no tiene ese nombre, hoy por hoy se llama: El Salvador 503, en donde fui super mal atendida como nunca, por la encargada del lugar, una mujer déspota con unas uñas tan asquerosas para alguien que trabaja directamente con servicio de comida....Primero llame para hacer mi pedido, y me respondió una nueva empleada, yo sin saberlo le ordené, me dío el precio y dijo que en 45 min. Me lo tendrían sentí mucho pero igual llegué pasado ese tiempo. Cuando llegue la administradora se tardó como 25 min. En cobrarle a otro cliente, según por problemas con su registradora,  al fin cuándo me atendió \"ME ESTABA COBRANDO EL DOBLE DEL PRECIO\"..... alegaba que tres pupusas del pedido eran más caras por ser de quezo, le dije que me las quitara, despues me dice que todo mi pedido me lo cambiarían por pupusas más pequeñas que las que ya me habían echado,  ya que la empleada era nueva y no habia podido hacer bien el pedido, las cuales tenía que esperar otros 45 minutos más, y eso si quería esperar, sino que no las llevara.....WOWWWWWW y Qué con mi tiempo? Más de 1hora  perdida, y mi hijito de 3 años con mucha hambre en ese momento, por eso NO se lo recomiendo,  por el pésimo servicio de la encargada!"}
{"text":"Nice food, great service, I went there for Guatemalan food and is a small selection but good flavor."}
{"text":"This place is great , the food is made when you order it , so it takes some time but the quality is on point . It's also great you can call in your order or even use there App in the app store and place online orders ,you can't beat that . If you want your food fast ..go to Burger King,  want quality food , go to this spot !"}
{"text":"Wow!! The Pupusas was delicious. First time having this fried slice of heaven with flavorful cabbage slaw and red sauce. Ms Angelica service was so outstanding!! Cannot wait to go back. Go grab one."}
{"text":"I ordered a gorgeous carne asada salad (at least the menu photo was pretty) medium rare. What I got was over done tasteless plate of shredded meat on yellow lettuce. I sent the salad back untouched and lost my taste for anything different. When presented with a bill for full cost of salad I was shocked! My husband paid it but will never go back. Terrible place"}
{"text":"On my break I came to eat and ordered cheese pupusas and some bananas let me tell you the food was DELICIOUS and very fresh. I'm a very picky person mostly when it comes down to food but coming here was great! The owner was so nice and made me feel right at home. First time coming but I will certainly be coming back and this will be on the top of the list of favorite places.   Delicious food and outstanding service... It's the spot to go to! Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We recently went to eat with all of our family, they had the best service and clean, the food was delicious, I really recommend  can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"great food. loved the papusas and the carne asada fries, can't wait to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Good food that's what's important. Takes a while to make but that means it's fresh! The place could use some updating but that's just cosmetic. Came in the early afternoon and there were no chicken breasts or hand napkins in the bathroom...it's the little things. But for the sake of discussing only the food I would come back and do take out. I would rather eat in the car."}
{"text":"Definitely try this place out. The phenomenal food is complimented with good customer service. I had the Churrasco dish. Hands down the best steak and shrimp I have ever had. The sausage was awesome too. I will be coming here again."}
{"text":"We were sorely disappointed in this place. We were excited upon reading their reviews on Google but it just didn't meet our expectations on the pupusas.  They had no flavor whatsoever. To be honest,  we couldn't tell the difference between the chicken, pork or cheese n beans. Everything just tasted the same & no, neither of us had a cold. We were happy to see plantain empanadas with fried ice cream on the dessert menu & were we ready for that! But to our dismay,  our gal who was assisting us with our order stated that they weren't serving any desserts. No apology,  no explanation....just \"yeah...we aren't serving any desserts\". That was that. Won't be back. There were more points I could make for this decision but why? It was a simple strike out."}
{"text":"I hated this place I literally came in to order at 12:20 I did not receive my order until 12:58 it was completely ridiculous. It was my first and last time going to this place. I have been to restaurants that have more traffic and with more complex dishes and they did not take a long to to get my food."}
{"text":"3-17-16 Was recommended to me and had a terrible experience here. We walked in and ordered my food to go around  4:40pm and my food was not ready until 5:50pm! Took over an hour considering there was only 2 tables occupied (5guests total) where the people were eating since we got there. We were the only people in restaurant by 5:30Pm. Some customers came in and left since they were not attended. We ordered 12 popusas 1 torta and 1 order of carne asada fries. The food was very poorly prepared. The popusas taste was good but the Carne asada fries had no carne (meat), torta was plain.Considering they had over an hour with barely any clientele in restaurant they should be ashamed of their service. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"A coworker brought me so I could try pupusas. The Salvadorian main entree. Its like a tortilla stiffed with a variety of options. I got to try 3 different ones. All very good.   The pupusas were small in size but quite filling. Topped with a cabbage and hot sauce, the meal was unique and one I'd love to try again.   Experiencinnew foods is always fun, especially when its good.   Loved the orange soda and fruit drink. I apologize I don't know the names, my coworker ordered everything for me."}
{"text":"Drove passed this place about a month ago, saw the pupusas sign on the window and said we would have to try it next time. Well, here we are and this place has GREAT authentic Salvadoreño food. The banana leaf wrapped chicken tamales are stupendous! Also had the pupusas, cheese & chicharrón, cheese & lorocco & a mixed pupusa. OMG! All was delicious. The curtido for the pupusas was just right and the \"hot\" salsa was not that spicy but has great flavor. We will definitely eat there again, maybe try different dishes."}
{"text":"Went here 6Pm on a Saturday night. Had always drove past this place on Rainbow so I thought we would give it a try. Ambiance is very basic: a few pictures on the wall with about 10 tables that seat a range of 2 (or 1)- 8 people per table. I am not sure if they take reservations. One person runs the register and the other cooks. When we were there, we sat ourselves and walked up to the counter to order.  We Ordered: 1)Horchata: $2.75- Super super sweet, much sweeter than I am used to 2)Plantaines with crèma and refried beans 6.99$ (kinda expensive for 6 plantains and some beans and crema)  3)Papusas 1.75-2.75$ each: we had the Shrimp and Cheese and the Everything Papusa: pork, shrimp, and cheese and some other things I couldn't tell what was in there - I would say you need about 2 papusas per person to get mildly full.  -DEF recommend the shrimp and cheese papusas -not overly greasy but still bland -BEST PART WAS THE Pickled cabbage that came with it  There was about 8 other people in the restaurant and our order took about 20 min. Service was kinda slow. We had to clean/Buss our own table - we watched Spanish soap operas while we waited   TIP: BRING CASH- There is a 0.50$ charge per credit card"}
{"text":"The lady with long, braided hair didn't welcome us in. We already had a bad vibe.   Service: It sucks, they didn't come as often. Only came to the table to deliver our food and asked for drinks. It took about 35 mins to make 5 revueltas pupusas, we should have went somewhere else.   Food: Salsa was very spicy for my taste. Revueltas pupusas was good, it wasn't great   All in all, I had other places that was much better than this. So disappointing."}
{"text":"Great Place, Delicious Food, Courteous Personnel. The Pupusas were delicious!! My daughters ordered Carne Asada Fries. Which had such a great presentation & tasted even better.  Will definitely be back to taste more item on the menu."}
{"text":"If you want real deal pupusas, you come to this place.  Compared to other Salvadorian spots, this place makes pupusas that are just like mom used to make (according to my Salvadorian friend).  And I concur, these pupusas are delicious!!  Prices range from $2 to $2.75 per pupusa.  3 or 4 will fill you up.  This is the only place I've ever seen that has a zucchini pupusa.    The only negatives are the service is a little slow and they don't have pasteles.  But if you're on the hunt for just pupusas, you're at the right place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat breakfast! The place is very welcoming and the food is delicious. When I eat here I feel like I'm at my grandmas home eating. The food taste like it's home maid. And the people that work there are always friendly and nice every time! I have not had a single complain ever!  I come here every week. I recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"Most places claim they have great Pupusas. This place follows through. Their Pupusas are not \"overly greasy\" and the flavor of the Chicharrón is great. The staff has great attitude as well."}
{"text":"El servicio es demasiado lento, no puedo creer que espere 55 minutos por una orden de 15 popusas, el lugar vacío, me dijeron 20 minutos."}
{"text":"I've had papusas at various El Salvadorian restaurants throughout the US and they have from my opinion some of the best. They were made in front of me and not pre-made like I've had before. There are other items on the menu if you are not down with papusas but if you are the are more varieties than I have seen elsewhere. AND the price is spot on!"}
{"text":"When my mum and I wanna hang out for a minute and have something to eat we come here. It's close to home and the staff is friendly and we just eat as many pupusas as we can. I love how I can come here during my lunch break too. Love it"}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointing!            I've ordered here before and always tent to order 12 or more popusas to go at a great price. Today I decided to make an order and the front desk notifies me that the 99. cent special, order of 12 or more is only applicable for Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday only.  Not to happy :( because it doesn't have that written down on the online specials section. Plus I've ordered before with the same price. I advised the lady that the information she's giving me is not very accurate because it's nowhere on the menu or online. Perhaps they didn't want to give me the special pricing? That's an issue! :(  This place is really unprofessional and would've liked to see them caring about providing exceptional customer service. The lady could've easily honored the special. It is not my fault they are not advertising correctly and properly. But she refused to be helpful.  I will most definitely be taking my popusa cravings elsewhere ;)   Note: I've tried the popusa tomato sauce on my last visit and it had a plastique after taste perhaps they are cooling the sauce in a plastic container? Not sure but I was going to ask but forgot about it after the whole ordeal."}
{"text":"Llegando 2:30 de la tarde ordené sólo unas pupusas unos tamales y un par de bebidas con mis dos hijas y  cuando la orden llega a la mesa se habían equivocado con la orden, entonces voy y pregunto que me dieron y la señora dueña del lugar me contesta mal y me dice de muy mala manera que me las va a regalar (dos pupusas ) a lo que yo contesto.. - no gracias, no vine a que me regale nada. Cuando pido mi cheque me dice que fueron 9 pupusas y que me quito dos .. Cuando sólo fueron 7 y me debía quitar 2.. para sólo 5 en total y de nuevo empezó a subir el tono de la voz y me dijo que no volviera a ese lugar y prácticamente me sacó del lugar.. Si es la dueña no creo que el negocio le dure mucho y se lo dejé saber por que ella de servicio al cliente lamentablemente no tiene idea alguna. La mesera que nada tuvo que ver sólo miraba a su propia jefe con vergüenza claramente . No lo recomiendo.. así no se atiende un negocio . Gritándole a los clientes ???? No no y no . Cuando le dije que calificaría el lugar en redes me contestó.. no me importa!! Acá no vuelva!! Interesante no ?"}
{"text":"I ordered one pupusa with pork and cheese and another one with bean and cheese. Both were really good!  Also got the sweet plantain with black beans and cream with a tamarind drink for a total of $13.   Delicious and affordable. I will be coming back for lunch time again."}
{"text":"Being Salvadorian I'm always a critic! The salsa given while we waited with chips OMG THE BEST! Better than a Mexican restaurant and of course have to mention the great customer service as always!"}
{"text":"These papusas are the real deal. The sauce and all. We were all silently eating them because they were that good."}
{"text":"I've got carried carry out here twice. Very satisfied with the food both times. The lady was friendly, she let me know ahead of time that the order was going to take little long for the order to be ready and checked up on me periodically while I was waiting."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time yesterday, and it was delicious! I got the cheese and pork pupusas which were AMAZING! Definitely coming back to try other things on the menu. I was also told they'll be adding more to their menu soon. This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Pupusas are amazing! I only get bean with a little cheese, and the Yucca frita is also perfect every time!! They have good service always really nice."}
{"text":"Food was nothing special to remember, but I will not forget that they took my credit card to back for extremely long time, the following days - collect call from prison as well as a motel near a prison made attempts to charge my card!"}
{"text":"The sign for pupusas drew us in! I had the cheese and pork, wife had the bean and cheese and chicken and cheese. Also tried the carne asada fries. Food was delicious and the server was very sweet."}
{"text":"We got 3 different kinds of pupusas: cheese and shrimp, mixed, zucchini and cheese.   The cheese and shrimp, there as not much of a shrimp flavor. It tasted more like just cheese. I don't recommend it.   Mixed: chicharron, beans and pork. It was good. Didn't really wow me but I would get it again  Zucchini and cheese: was amazing!!! I would get it.    The was not greasy, I'm used to greasy pupusas. It almost tasted doughy to me. I would come back here if my favorite pupusas shop is closed. I also recommend getting the plantains with beans and crema. It's my favorite!"}
