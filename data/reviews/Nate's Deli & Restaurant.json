{"text":"The food was wonderful! I had the Hummus and my friends both had some really good salad type thing... My boyfriend wasn't up for trying anything new and just had a BLT but he said that was good too! The only thing that bothered me was that they didn't take credit cards and there was barely any signage telling us so!

I play on going again the next time I actually have some cash on me!"}
{"text":"I can't speak to the American deli food, but the Middle Eastern dishes are fantastic. Not the most exciting dining environment, but it's very clean and pretty comfortable, which should reassure those less adventurous folks who aren't into a hole-in-the-wall experience."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about Nate's.  Another staple on W.25th.  Amazing service.  Great for take-out if you don't want to squeeze into the restaurant.

Very affordable and super tasty."}
{"text":"The vegetarian platter is awesome. The hummus and baklava were really tasty. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Totally awesome, every time in every way. I would eat here every day if I could!!!

Note: take cash, no cards accepted!"}
{"text":"Some of the best middle eastern food in Cleveland. Their hummus is amazingly smooth and delicious. I always order a falafel sandwich, but I also enjoy their salads. 

I've been going there for years, and I still see the same waitresses. Good eats at cheap prices. You may have to wait for a table. It does get crowded, and they are closed for dinner."}
{"text":"The food here is Great.  The waitresses are very nice and they always strive to give you that little extra with your meal, whether it is more thousand island dressing or another pickle, these little extras go a long way.  The only thing keeping it from a 5 Star is the waiting area...there is none and can get crowded by the cash register when ordering take out."}
{"text":"Nate's serves authentic Lebanese food. I was introduced to this place when I worked on Franklin about 12 years ago. I since left the area, but returned twice over the last 10 years. The baba ghanoush is exceptional...very flavorful and made with care. I recommend the Hummus and Shawarma (beef or chicken). You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Nate's is my favorite Lebanese restaurant in Greater Cleveland. The menu has some deli sandwiches (i.e., corned beef, etc.), but the main attraction is the Lebanese food. Walk back through the narrow passage to the restroom, and you'll pass by the bustling kitchen where (presumably) Lebanese women chop fresh beets to garnish the delicious, authentic dishes. This is a great alternative to Americanized takes on Lebanese in the area, and its location just steps from the West Side Market makes for a real urban experience. Easily reached from the RTA Red Line, one station west of Tower City Center... Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. They really make you feel like you're enjoying a meal made with pride by people who have been using the same family recipes for years. The falafel is the best around. Only open for lunch, fast friendly service, clean and simple dining room. Cash only. Great for vegetarians, great value. Only losing a star because I wish they made fresh pita rather than providing you with a package of Aladdin's pita."}
{"text":"Everyone agrees Nate's has delicious Mediterranean food - hummus, tabulee, sandwich rolls.  Also has refreshing homemade lemonade.  Service is pleasant, fast and efficient.

If you get a chance to go, take a peek into their kitchen in the back and see people working with dough and fresh ingredients.  I think they are mainly open for lunch.  Cheap, cash only.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had Corned Beef sandwich.  Nicely done meat. Rye bread okay but I should have ordered it toasted or grilled.  slaw was over dressed and outrageously priced at $2.50 for a saucer full.  It may have even been prepackaged.  Not sure I would order anything from here again.  Not real bad but not worth a second trip.  Dull"}
{"text":"Hands down best Arabic food we've tried in a while, I live in Chicago and nothing compares! Grape leaves, kibbe absolutely phenomenal. Tastes like my grandmas home cooked food. Kabab and kofta also were great! I was initially turned off by the name, but it was an absolute delight. Will be a regular spot for us from now on."}
{"text":"This IS the best Middle Eastern food in Cleveland and surrounding suburbs.  I agree that it is better than Alladin's.  Everyone in our party was there for the first time, and we all agreed that the food was outstanding.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I've been going to Nate's for ahem, decades. Now bring my three children along with me. Husband and I get hummus, grape leaves, and shish tawook sandwiches; the same thing EVERY SINGLE TIME. The waitresses know not to bring us menus since we don't need them. Daughter just branched out and ordered the sharwma sandwich, (sp?), and that may be her new favorite. Had the fattoush salad too, and loved the freshness of it, just can't order everything as much as I'd like to do so. A reviewer called Nate's \"average.\" Yelp Readers; it is so beyond average. Beats Aladdins all to heck. I keep a large container of their garlic mayo in my fridge. Most items are made in house; love the homemade yogurt that comes with the grape leaves. Fast service, very fresh food, reasonable prices. Cannot beat Nate's!"}
{"text":"Definitely, a diamond in the rough.  Whenever I'm in market square for lunch, I stop by Nate's, my favorite hole-in-the wall.  Nate's Deli has been around for years and it is always busy. The restaurant is a former store-front a few doors down from the West Side Market; parking is in the rear.  This is where it all begins.

If you park in the back, you walk in through the kitchen with the whole family working.  Elderly ladies greet you in their thick accents while chopping fresh parsley for the many lunch items.

The menu is not a typical \"deli\" menu, so go elsewhere if you want that.  What they do have is the most amazing Middle Eastern food that I often have a hard time choosing what I want for that particular day.  The Shistawook (marinated grilled chicken in a pita) is one of my favorites.  I always get the garlic on the side if I plan to return to work.  It is powerful, yet delicious, and guaranteed to keep the vampires away.  

Also on my list of favorites is the tabouli, fatooush, Baba G and hummus.  I always love the pickled turnips they bring to the table and they don't last too long.  Baby, this is true, non-immitation Middle Eastern food and you will never buy it any cheaper.

The service -- hmmm where do I begin?  There is one waitress that reminds me of the soup Nazi.  She has been there forever and many people go there simply to watch and hear her.  Take no offense to her rudeness, it's just part of the atmosphere.  Some of my friends tip her extra because she is so entertaining when she barks out orders.  

The drinks are non-alcoholic and soft drinks are by-the-can.  It is cash-only, so be prepared.  Seat yourself because nobody will do it for you.  The most coveted seats are \"in the window\" (think old shoe store where you walk in with display cases on each side).  Most of the patrons are regulars and know that in advnace.  You can order Nate's through Food Fetchers and the food is always hot when you get it.


Nate's Deli is one of those places that I always recommend to both locals and out-of-towners.  My only complaint is they are not open on Sundays or evenings."}
{"text":"OK.  I'll admit it.   Although a born-and-bred Clevelander (with multiple years away in other major metros), I only went to Nate's within the last year.   Yes ....year.

It always looked like a trashy dump and dirty as a deed done dirt cheap.

A new work colleague suggested it last year for lunch and my eyebrows shot up with a \"No way\" message like two Wooly Bears tusslin' on a tree branch in October.

OK, so I went.   And, damn, it was GOOD.

I love the waitresses ...I love the old school Cleveland crowd.   And, yeah, the food is great.   

My faves?   The shwarma/hummus plate.   Share a fattoush.   And, if Im starving?   Add two falafel.  

Waddle out the door shortly thereafter.

After paying cash.  'Natch.


  No credit cards accepted."}
{"text":"A good friend introduced me to Nate's in January and have gone back 4 times since. In love with the fattoush which is perfect in everyway, fresh with just the right amount of lemon, sumac and olive oil. The hummus is so delicious with just the right amount of tahini for my taste. I love getting a meal that satisfies both my hunger and doesn't shock at the register. Can't forget about the friendly, competent service! Also nice to get a peek into the kitchen and find everyone laughing, smiling and enjoying themselves. I think there is a direct connection between the happiness of the cook and the quality of the food - just my experience!"}
{"text":"Yesterday brought us a trip to the dog park, hungry bellies, and an empty fridge. So after a quick yelp search, we called Nate's Deli at 4:30pm. By 5:00 we were chowing down on soft pita, warm but not too crunchy falafel and creamy potato salad. They even put extra hummus on our sandwich rolls. Delish! 
Although the deli was getting ready to close, they filled our order at record speed, and even gave us an extra potato salad. Now, that's what I call service. 
The food is delicious, my beau says the service is ultra friendly and you get fresh food quickly. 
I can't believe it's taken us so long to try out this gem a short bike ride from our house. We will absolutely be back for more."}
{"text":"I must preface by saying I have been frequenting Nate's for well over a decade.  The owner is a very close friend of my family, however that has no impact what-so-ever on my review.

-

Being Lebanese and having lived in the Cleveland area my entire life, there have really only been two options in Cleveland for the best Middle Eastern cuisine, both being Lebanese restaurants (Lebanese define Middle Eastern food, ask Anthony Bourdain).  Besides Nate's, the other - now closed - was The Middle East Restaurant over on E.9th & Prospect.  After that restaurant closed, Nate's remained as the undisputed champion of Middle Eastern restaurants in the Cleveland area.

I've been eating these foods my entire life and knowing how they SHOULD taste, I can honestly say that Nate's is truly on point in terms of authenticity.  Whether it's mezza like hummus, tabouli, fattoush, baba or meals like shawarma, falafel, kefta; All are extremely tasty at Nate's.

If you're daring and not a vegetarian, try the kibbeh nayeh (if available).  It's more of a delicacy and may require an acquired taste.  A lot of Lebanese jokingly judge how well of a cook you are on your ability to properly (key word) prepare it.  I've had it here, it is excellent.  Only one place I've ever been (in the US or in Lebanon) has made it better.

All in all, Nate's is an Ohio City legend.  If you haven't tried it, do yourself the flavor ;)"}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place!  I've eaten here 4 consecutive days!  Put it on your bucket list. If you live in northeast Ohio put it in your routine. Very pleasant employees. Great atmosphere. Phenomenal menu and food!  I'd give them more than 5 stars if it were possible!"}
{"text":"Great food, fast service! Awesome for lunch. Definitely recommended for good Middle Eastern food"}
{"text":"Ate lunch at Nate's while visiting Cleveland for the day. Longtime family run restaurant featuring deli sandwiches and Mediterranean fare, comfortable, near the very cool West Side Market. I may have been the only one from out-of-town, the entire restaurant seemed filled with locals and regulars. I had the Fattoush and Shawarma Platter with hummus - delicious, among the best I've had. Highly recommended, will go back again whenever I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I've been going to Nate's since my childhood, and for good reason- the food and service are excellent!  I love the cozy diner feel, and the nostalgic pictures of Lebanon adorning their walls.  I always get the shish tawook sandwich- perfectly marinated, tender cubes of chicken, with garlic sauce, wrapped in warm pita bread- yum!  And their hummus, in my opinion/experience, is the best I've had anywhere in the world (including Lebanon)!  They also now serve french fries!  Make sure you have cash, because they don't take credit card."}
{"text":"Spot on food and service for the money. The deli sandwiches are excellent, the shistawouk is divine. About the only thing Nate's doesn't do is credit cards - bring cash or a check if you want a great, quick meal."}
{"text":"cheap mediterranean staple.  'sgot regular deli food too but i've only ordered from the mdtrrnn side.  hummus & fattoush are better than most.  food comes out fast.  you used to be able to get some entertainment during a busy lunch rush when the two older server ladies would catfight about who's turn it is to seat.  i think the one of them left though.  'sok cuz the girl hired in her place is fit"}
{"text":"Best Lebanese Food in town.  Tables turn quick.  Food is super fast and super fresh.   Fatoush is excellent and the humous shwarma is outstanding.    My favorite is the grape leaves.   They have both vegetarian and meat.    The meat ones are the best!"}
{"text":"My family and I got takeout from here today (via Food Fetchers). We ordered WAY too much, but we needed to stock up! My husband got a couple of NY style deli sandwiches and said that the corned beef was the best he's had in a long time. My mom and I got falafel sandwiches and fatooush salad. We also got some hummus and an obscene amount of pitas.

While everything tasted very fresh, with unique flavorings, I was not the BIGGEST fan of how much salt and vinegar were used. Other than that, a great middle eastern staple in the Cleve!"}
{"text":"So the wife and I went to W25 for the day. She wanted to go to Nates Deli to eat. When we arrived the place was 40% full and quiet. Me being 6'3\" 225 lbs we sat in one of the empty booths. The waitress immediately came over and quickly instructed us \"you can't sit there\" because it was for 3 or more people and we had to sit at a table for two that are the size of a SCRABBLE board. We moved over to the smaller table but quickly agreed to leave after her order to move. With 30 restaurants on W25 they need to relax and be a little more accommodating."}
{"text":"What a cute place.  The waitress was so friendly and offered us recommendations on the Middle Eastern dishes.  She brought us samples to try.  The fatoosh was outstanding as was the hummus.  The shwarma on hummus was awesome!  The prices were affordable and the portions size just right.  I would highly recommend this place.  Not sure about the \"New York\" side of the menu- but the Middle Eastern half was great!"}
{"text":"There are plenty of good delis in Cleveland, but for the ones I've been to often enough to get a sense of their consistency, Nate's probably has the best corned beef I've had.  It's always tender and moist, never dried and never sliced too thick.  It's a small place, not much seating, but it's usually not crowded.  They've gotten a little pricey over the years, but when the mood hits for one of their sandwiches, there's still no substitute.  I used to eat there pretty regularly, and even though probably don't make it there more than a few times a year now, they still know me by sight, know my order, and the service is always friendly and good."}
{"text":"In the red corner is falafel and hummus from Nate's Deli.  In the blue corner is falafel and hummus from Maha's Falafel.  The bell rings.  It's a good, old-fashioned slobberknocker of who has the better food.  Both are extremely delicious and offer different eating experiences.  Nate's and its \"I let customers know at 4pm that we close at 5pm\" waitress hustle and sit-down atmosphere vs. the standup and eat thrill of Maha's at West Side Market.  Both are killer, killer good.  I do like the spicy sauce at Maha's.  But I have to hand it to Nate's overall.  The falafels are less greasy and the hummus is super smooth and flavorful and it doesn't have as much garlic as Maha's.  What made me chuckle at Nate's is they bring you pitas in their original plastic bag and slap them down on the table.  Nothing like saying, \"Hey, no frills here.\"  I don't know why people waste their time at Aladdin's because this place is head and shoulders better.  Everything is made from scratch.  Shishtawook (chicken) rolled sandwich is good but be prepared to each chicken chunks slathered in mayonnaise and nothing else.  Delicious but could have had more \"stuff\" in it.  Cash or check only."}
{"text":"Hands down the best middle eastern food in Cleveland! Service is fast, food is fresh & servers are friendly! Hummus was good- served with warm pita. Grape leaves were tasty & fattoush was amazing- best I've ever had! Excited to go back and try other items!"}
{"text":"Always great food. Service always sucks, and they don't take cards, only cash. The staff is rude consistently. But ignore them, and the cheap, delicious food is worth it!"}
{"text":"Great little place with delicious homemade hummus, great sandwiches and a great twist on chicken noodle soup. Cash only."}
{"text":"I have never been to Nate's, and after reading their blurb about having the best hummus in Cleveland, I don't think I will ever go there.  I took offense at the owner's comment, something about how people who put garlic in their hummus are just trying to cover up the fact that they don't know how to make it.  Excuse me, I happen to LIKE garlic in my hummus, and I have been making it that way for years.  There are all kinds of brands on the market who put garlic in their hummus, and people are buying it like crazy.  Guess we are all a bunch of dummies who don't know what hummus is supposed to taste like.  What an arrogant remark to make!!!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Nate's. Expecting great things based on the Yelp reviews, we tried Nate's for the first time on Saturday and were not disappointed. Our hostess was so friendly and gave her recommendation of what we should order as first-timers. We went with the felafel plate, stuffed grape leaves, half plate of hummus, and fattoush. We shared it all and it was the perfect lunch for two. All of it excellent. And the bill at the register? A tiny $19.87. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"If you're from Cleveland and haven't been to Nate's shame on you. If you're visiting from out of town make it a point to stop in, either before or after your visit to the West Side Market.  

In the 23 years that I have been going to Nate's I have yet to sample anything other than their fantastic Lebanese food from their menu. Instead of a deli sandwich, make sure you try the superb baba ganooj and the beguilingly creamy hummus ($4.25/$6.95). The pureed eggplant is slightly smoky with the perfect balance of tahini and lemon. The hummus is addicting and you will want to eat it with everything; don't blame me if you find yourself dipping everything and anything in it, just like they do in Sandler's \"You Don't Mess with the Zohan\", trust me it's that good. Each of these delicacies is drizzled with olive oil, served with warm pita, and piquant, garishly colored pickled turnips.  

Next, try the Shish Tawook Sandwich ($5.50) - a rolled up piece of pita bread (like a cigar) contains tender cubes of chicken breast and a zippy garlic mayo. If you're looking for something more substantial, the beef Shawarma Platter with hummus ($12.75) will definitely satisfy. 

The fattoosh ($5.50) is equally satisfying in the \"I-need-something-green\" kind of way; mercifully the toasted pita chips remain crisp and you get plenty of tomatoes, green peppers and onions mixed with the lettuce, oil and vinegar. The tabbulee ($3.75/$6.50) at Nate's has the requisite zing from the fresh lemon juice based dressing without making your lips pucker like in some versions that I've had in those new age hippy-dippy joints. This is the real thing.

For me, dropping into Nate's is like visiting my own family where the surroundings are well-known, the greetings sincere and relaxed, and the aromas familiar. The food is authentic, unpretentious, and remarkable for its consistency. There are some things that shouldn't change; I'm thankful Nate's hasn't."}
{"text":"Went for brunch with my sister and we both loved our meals! I had a \"Build Your Own Omelette\" with mushrooms, onions, green peppers, jalapeños, tomatoes and cheddar. It was cooked to perfection! I'm really particular about eggs and very rarely order them at restaurants because they usually aren't cooked well/done enough. But my omelette was cooked just right. It came with thin sliced fried potatoes and I chose rye bread for my toast. I've  pretty much eliminated potatoes from my diet, but I am so glad I decided to indulge this time - they were  delish with a little ketchup and hot sauce. The rye toast was so tasty, I bought an entire loaf to go.
My sister got 2 eggs over medium, sausage links, potatoes and white toast. She liked it so much, she cleaned her  plate. I stole two bites of sausage and kicked myself for not ordering my own! 
We totally loved our first visit to Nate's and look forward to going again very soon! It's about  a half hour drive for us but totally worth it."}
{"text":"There were hairs in my food. I pulled the first one out but then there was another. The server said I would not have to pay for my sandwich. When I got up to pay for the rest of the meal, the two people up front (a man and a woman) told me the total. I did not get the opportunity to review the check at the table. The total included my sandwich. I told them that the server said it would be free and the woman said that the one with the hair was free but the replacement sandwich needed to be paid for. She straight up said \"You ate the second one, didn't you?\" I appealed to the man and he replied that if I had refused the replacement sandwich I would not have had to pay for it but that since I went ahead and got a new one (because I needed to eat lunch) that I had to pay. I have worked in restaurants, eaten at thousands of restaurants and have never heard of a policy like this. I was floored. Paid for it and left."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a lazy saturday morning. Ordered a Grilled Corn Beef, Swiss Cheese to go.  Surprised when I got home and found a smallish corned Beef and Swiss not Grilled. New owners seem to be skimping on the meat yet still charging $9.00 for a full sandwich."}
{"text":"Went here with a large crowd, and everyone tucked into this food like there was no tomorrow.  The stellar hit for me was the beef shwarma platter, succulent, perfect hints of sweet and musky spices.  most amazing lebanese shwarma I've had, so good it doesn't even need other sides. Others loved the fattoush, and the hummus.  The savory food is so good, I would definitely skip the sweet stuff."}
{"text":"Do get the hummus!  Comes with tasty pickled beets and other veggies as well as fresh pitas.  
This is one of the best deals in Cleveland!  Last time I checked it was only open for lunch, but it's well worth taking an extra half hour and a drive on your lunch break."}
{"text":"Simply the BEST fresh, middle eastern food in Cleveland! The fattoush salad is beyond delicious, I have been known to make an hour long round trip just to get one. I order mine with the pita chips on the side in the event that I want to take the rest of the salad home, plus it's fun eating the salad atop crisp pita chips. I highly recommend trying this lunch place, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Pros: thick steak fries and a decent grilled cheese made for a decent lunch.

Cons: the potato pancakes were way underdone; the place smelled like disinfectant; everyone working there stared at us for most of our meal; and they rushed us out of there faster than you can say unfriendly."}
{"text":"One of the best Middle Eastern restaurant in Cleveland. A friend of mine turned me on to this place.  Whenever I'm in Cleveland, I always make it a point to stop there for lunch.  Their sharwarma is the best!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service but good Mediterranean food and affordable. I paid less than a fast food lunch might have cost.If you are looking for GREAT Lebanese/Syrian food in the Cleveland area, Nate's is the place. I had the Shish ta wook, hummus and fatoosh. Their gyro is also really good i had a bite of my husbands and the meat was so succulent and tender. The hummus was out of this world, and the best grape leaves you can find in cleveland!"}
{"text":"Great food! You can also get take out if you want. Just park at the westside market. There is also an entrance in the back, facing the parking lots. Bring cash...credit cards not accepted. Relatively inexpensive and totally worth it. You have to go!!"}
{"text":"We went at about 2:00 PM with a party of 5 and were seated promptly. Parking can be tricky and I only found out later about the lot in back! At first, I was a bit skeptical of the service as it took a while to get to our table, but once we ordered, everything seemed to fly out of the kitchen!! The Hummus, Falafel Platter, and even a chicken noodle soup. Everything was tasty and our server was a real delight, as was the rest of the family. Anybody planning a trip to the West Side Market to should include a stop here as well."}
{"text":"Went here for a weekday lunch and it was pretty hopping but we still got seated fast and got our food fast too. The hummus was wonderful, the fattoush salad was the best I ever had. Then we ordered a rolled shish tawook. I wouldn't really order it again because it's just not my thing but it was good. I'll have to go again and try something else as my main coarse. And maybe some baba ghannoush.

Park in the lot behind this place and enter from the back. You will actually walk through the kitchen."}
{"text":"Just had the best shawarma and hommus I've ever eaten. I am now ruined for Alladin's. This is one of those places that will make it very difficult for me to eat anywhere else if I am within a mile."}
{"text":"A few months ago, I was on a mission to find the best gyro in Cleveland and with a recommendation in hand, I went to Nate's.   

I was greeted immediately upon entering by the owner and also a waitress who were both very friendly. It is a clean space, enough seating to bring a few people with you too. I ordered the gyro to go and a slice of carrot cake to go. The wait wasn't very long, no more than 10 minutes I was in and out. I could not wait to get home! 

The gyro: I've had many, many gyros and so when it came to this one, it was average to me, maybe slightly above. It was hot and fresh, sauces were amazing and everything came together nicely, BUT something about the meat itself left something to be desired in my opinion. 

Carrot cake: how can you go wrong with carrot cake? It was homemade and deliciously overwhelming, I ate it in 3 servings... YES, it's that big. 

Super friendly, clean, good food, good prices! Id come back and maybe try something else next time :)"}
{"text":"Nates has the best hummus I have ever ever had! I love when you come in through the back door, you walk through the kitchen area and you see the family working on the food! It's just authentic good, fresh, fantastic flavorful food.  Very casual, yet exclusive because it's just nothing fancy but the food and service are fantastic. That's what counts. I love the hustle and bustle atmosphere. Very NYC!"}
{"text":"My family and I moved from Rocky River to SoCal 9 months ago, and we recently stopped here during a visit back to Cleveland. I miss this place. I started going to Nate's late 90s, maybe early 2000s? I went here before having children, during all of my pregnancies and when my children were babies. No wonder they love Nate's, too! I don't get excited about food, but this place is truly comfort food for my family. Their fattoush and falafels have always been my favorites. We plan on stopping by any time we are in town."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE place for Middle Eastern Food, its not fancy, but oh is the food tasty and reasonably priced.   I've been coming here for years and try to get here at least once per week.   The servers know me.   They know that I like to sit in the window so that I can people watch, and that I like my water without lemon:-).   The place is always packed at lunch, but I never have to wait for my food.   I love the Chicken Shishtawook rolled pita and the tabbouli.   The rolled pitas aren't stuffed with lots of ingredients like other places, but still very good.  Each order arrives with a side of peppers and pickled turnips (yum).   I usually park in the back which means that I literally walk thru the kitchen to get to the dining area.  The place is family owned and everyone in the kitchen is busily working....chopping up fresh veggies etc.   As other reviewers have noted they don't accept credit cards, so I have to make it a point to make sure that I have cash before I go.   

The Fattoush salad is very popular and also very good and I also enjoy the chicken noodle soup which has a unique Middle Eastern twist.....cinnamon maybe???

I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. epitome of a well run family business. I usually pop in for some lunch take out during the work week. Even if the place is busy, food comes out fast, warm, and cheap.

The shwarma roll is my absolute favorite, and the burgers are also good."}
{"text":"Their wraps, all of them, are delicious. Their hummus, pita (from Aladdin's Bakery), and their tahini sauce is delicious. Love this place for lunch, I've never had anything here that I didn't like. It may not be the best, but  its consistently delicious and really, that's all you really need for a great lunch spot."}
{"text":"Enter Nate's Deli and you step into an intimate restaurant filled with warmth and good smells. Immensely satisfying dishes, generous portions of pita, and piquant garlic mayo contributed to the delicious experience. Everyone working seemed happy to be there. A trip to the bathroom takes you through the kitchen past the beaming faces smiling kindly at you. They also sell mint gum if you're concerned about garlic breath."}
{"text":"This place is the standard for Lebanese food.  Absolutely craveable, absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Nate's is one of our go-to breakfast places on the west side.  The food is excellent, not fancy but definitely on the higher end, quality-wise.  Excellent toast and any of the meats are great, as one might expect from a deli.  The service is usually quick, though we've had one or two bad experiences.  Pricing is average.

There are a couple downsides.  Not every pop selection is a fountain drink, so be careful what you order or you might end up with a single 12-oz can and no refills.  It's a busy place and there's no place to wait for a table, so it can be awkward if there's a wait (and there often is during busy weekend hours).  You seat yourself, and I've seen a couple minor skirmishes when someone grabbed a table and someone else felt like it should've been theirs.  It's a small place with a lot of tables, so if you're looking for lots of elbow room, you'll need to grab one of the booths.  I wouldn't advise going here if you have a larger (more than 4) group, at least not on a weekend.

(Update 7/12/17, deducted a star): We're starting to get sporadically bad service from a couple of the waitresses.  There's one who has red hair, older woman, very friendly, who just seems to be unable to remember anything past the point she walks away from your table.  We've sat in her section and been ignored for quite a while, or asked for beverage refills multiple times and then just got up and walked behind the counter ourselves.  This has happened on more than one occasion and we noticed other diners having similar problems with her.  So I'll amend my review to say, \"Make sure you figure out which waitresses are good and stick with them.\""}
{"text":"Delicious...I got the hummus, falafel roll and fattoush salad. All are great, but the salad is by far the best thing ever. Be sure to get the crunchy pita mixed in if you're eating it right away. The staff is so kind and sweet. Probably going back tomorrow for lunch."}
{"text":"Nate's was recommended to me by a friend.  I had already eaten but went there for a bite to eat and I'm glad I did.

I only knew one Nate, or Nathaniel, while growing up and he was an acquaintance.  What I do know is that, when I was a kid, Nate, and Nates in general, automatically became \"Nate the Skate.\" \"Nate the Skate\" is a real person.  What I also recall is that if a Greek guy was named Nick, he seemingly became \"Nick the Greek, the t***y freak.\"  I didn't make that up.  That is older than the hills.  But here, we are talking about Middle Eastern food, and not necessarily Greek food, though they are sort of joined at the hip.

Nate's is located in Ohio City, which is not a separate city, but a Cleveland neighborhood west of downtown, south of the lake, and accessible by several freeways from the exits for West 25th Avenue.  It is near, but not in the West Side Market.  Either way, both the market and this restaurant are served by the RTA Red Line through its Ohio City-W 25th Ave. station.

Nate's is a small restaurant that you'd see in the downtown area of a smaller city or in an established and/or gentrifying neighborhood.  In this case, it's in the latter.  

I had hummus and hot tea. The hummus was appropriately priced and delicious.  I'd sure like to try some other things at Nate's, given that all these wonderful scents were tantalizing to my olfactory nerve.

The service was very friendly and I was able to survey some photos of Lebanon on the wall. The store also has these small wings up front made by the recessed front door that allowed them to have placed a few two tops in them.  That's where I sat, eating my food and looking at the street life.

If you like Middle Eastern food, and/or Greek food and the foods of the eastern Mediterranean in general, then try Nate's.  If doing so in conjunction with a trip to the West Side Market, leave some room in your stomach.  Many people seem to like Nate's as well and, as the saying goes, 20,000 Frenchmen can't be wrong."}
{"text":"Efficient service casual Mediterranean fair. Now compared to Sittoos the shishtawook wrap doesn't stand a chance. The falafel wrap was ample for the price. The kids liked their PBJ and grilled cheese sandwich. The garlic sauce was yummy. Living on the west side won't be driving to this one specifically given easy driving options of Mediterranean food nearby."}
{"text":"Nate's Deli is everything. I am an extremely tough judge of Mediterranean food and it met all of my expectations. I ordered the fattoush, grape leaves, and swarma pita. My mom and I split all 3 and it was the perfect amount for lunch. The yogurt sauce was out of this world!! I could eat it by itself. The fattoush was the best I have EVER had and the raw kibbi is AMAZING.

The service was impeccable, out waitress was on everything like flies on shit. I do wish they were open later on week days, though. I would love to be able to come home from work and look forward to eating at Nate's for dinner. One can dream...."}
{"text":"This deli has both American sandwiches and middle Eastern food.  We went with the middle Eastern food. Food was tasty, with good sized portions. I had the gyro and my wife had the chicken kabob wrap. By the way, the pink pickled vegetables included with your meal are pickled turnips."}
{"text":"What else can be said, Nates is a Cleveland staple!  We love it.  I have tried multiple dishes and enjoyed each one, highly recommend!  We love the atmosphere and family feeling of Nates."}
{"text":"The best middle eastern food in the city and one of the best restaurants in the city. Go!"}
{"text":"4 stars good food, good service, been eating there on and off for years. I love the fatoosh salad and hummus. I would've given 5 stars BUT parking is a hassle, and the restaurant is to small"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is good, prices are reasonable, and service is always efficient!"}
{"text":"So, I've been meaning to check out Nate's for years, always hearing how it had some of the best med food in the city.  I finally got the chance to check it out this past Saturday, after the Christmas Story Run 10K. My friend from out of town and I were understandably ravenous after the race, and since we were in the area I figured this was the time to finally go to Nate's!

Meh.

We both ordered  the fatoush, which was fine.  Fairly standard as fatoush goes, nothing special but fine.  I ordered the Kafta dinner and she ordered the Shish Tawook dinner.

Both came with rice pilaf, which was also fine.  Hard to mess up rice pilaf, so nothing special there.  The pita was serviceable and served warm, which was nice.  

But the meat!  This is where restaurants rise or fall, based on the quality of the meat!  My friend's shish tawook was sawdust dry.  So dry in fact, that I suggested that she might want to send it back.  Surely chicken THIS dry at a place of such reputation had to be a terrible mistake.  Alas, she politely declined, as Canadians are wont to do.  My kafta was extremely dense, chewy, and blandly seasoned.  Not bad enough to send back, but I suspect this is just how they make it here.

Every other Mediterranean/Lebanese/Turkish/Middle Eastern etc. place that I've been to in Cleveland has far better meat than what they serve here at Nate's Deli.  Even Sitoo's serves up better food and kaftas that are savory and nearly as light and fluffy as pillows.

They do have good Turkish coffee and serve a very generous amount, which I appreciated."}
{"text":"The best hummus anywhere, and their falafel roll is the my favorite!  Enter through the rear door and you will see the CLEANEST kitchen anywhere, and the busiest, most efficient group of women delivering enormous quantities of fresh, colorful and delicious food through the window to the serving area.  Service is friendly and fast.  Takeout is quick and efficient, and always accurate.  The best middle eastern food in northeast Ohio.  And since there is no smoking in any workplace in Ohio, the concern about second hand smoke is over!"}
{"text":"I recently heard that Nate's has the best hummus in Cleveland. I love Mediterranean food so it was already on my list of places to try, finally got a chance to have lunch here today with my parents and my fiancé. We all ordered something different and shared sides of hummus, babaganooj, and tabouli. The best hummus in Cleveland? I haven't had many others, but this was so far not even near the top of my favorites. Not bad, though. I was just surprised. 

I ordered the shawarma sandwich wrap. The meat was very tasty but lacking something as a sandwich. It didn't come with any tomato, lettuce, garlic sauce. Nothing. Just meat and bread.  My mother ordered the chicken shish Tawook. Same thing. Just chicken and bread. Dad had the dinner kefta plate. His was probably the most food, but at $14 it was a bit much for lunch. We also tried the shawarma over hummus plate. That was a big surprise when it came out because the little plate it was on was so small! The size of a side salad plate. And that was $12.  I had noticed the photo on yelp someone posted of the same dish in a take out box and it looked like they were given a lot more food. I would've liked some garlic sauce but that didn't come with any of our meals. Other than 1 coffee, none of us ordered a drink and the bill came to $57. It was just not as good as I was expecting. 

On the plus side though we were greeted when we walked in, and our waitress was friendly. Parking could be a disaster but we lucked out and found a spot."}
{"text":"Shove a beef shawarma roll in your face and tell me it's not delicious. 

Go ahead -- I'll wait. 

Seriously, it's one of my favorite lunch items on their menu. Perfectly spiced beef rolled up with delicious tahini sauce in a warm, slightly crispy pita. You don't need anything else on it or in it. Just enjoy it as it is and thank me later. 

Also, they have a signature Nate's sandwich, but I can't remember the name. It's loaded with delicious deli meats, cheese, tomato, lettuce, mayo and more. I don't know if they sprinkle magic on it, or what, but it's darn good. Try it with a heartier bread, though. It's better than with the pita. 

The hummus is still the best I've had in CLE--ridiculously creamy with a hint of tartness, almost. It's just perfection. And the fatoosh... I mean, is there better fatoosh around Cleveland? Because if there is, I haven't tried it. 

Still cash only!"}
{"text":"Best Lebanese food in Cleveland. No other place comes close. The hummus, Kibbeh nayyeh, and shish tawook are great."}
{"text":"Falafel salad & hummus were fresh & delicious. Great portions. Fair prices. Ready & packaged up very quickly. Syrofoam to go packaging isn't my favorite but other than that some pretty decent middle eastern food! Probably won't be back because the atmosphere was lacking but I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"Cozy and charming brunch spot, but I was not a fan of the corned beef hash as the meat had an overly grainy quality to it.  On the plus side, the corned beef-to-hash ratio was a lot higher then you get at a lot of places and the pancakes were thick and fluffy.  Service was uneven--friendly at times and forgetful and unaccommodating of requests at others."}
{"text":"We order in lunch quite a bit where I work, and Nate's Deli is one of my favorites! I must admit that I'm oddly confused by the amount of options they have on their menu.  Seriously - Burgers, Middle Eastern yummies, and deli sandwiches? What? 

Well, I suppose I don't have to care about the weird menu, because the food is delicious!  The Falafel Sandwich Roll wrapped between fresh Aladdin's pita is just wonderful.  Their falafel isn't super crispy, which I like - and their hummus is super creamy and wonderful.  Add a little hot sauce to the hummus, and you have yourself a delicious kick!"}
{"text":"I had company over so I decided to pick up a nice sampling of Nate's Deli for us to try out. Staff was pleasant any my order was ready when I got there. Interior seemed like a cozy spot at a Mom & Pop type joint. Note that they are only open until 5pm. 

For food we got:
*Combination Platter $16
*Grilled Platter $17
*Falafel Ball 65¢
*Spinach Pie $1.75
*kibbee Ball $2
*Baklava $1.25 

Honestly it was all just okay/mediocre. Not bad, but I've definitely had better. The kibbee ball and grape leaves were good, otherwise I don't get the hype surrounding this place. I didn't think the meats had much flavor to them and the falafel balls seemed very dry and overly fluffy inside. Hummus, baba ganoush, and baklava were all standard. Garlic sauce tasted like regular mayo. I actually felt really bad because my dining companion was so disappointed in the food. There were no seconds for us, we threw the leftovers in the trash. 

I am glad that I finally checked this place out, but I would probably not come here again. Cafe Falafel had really great veggie and grilled platters at lower prices. Oasis Cafe & Bakery is a hidden gem in Lakewood with delicious food all around. Ferris Deli has a great schwarma wrap and the garlic sauce is perfect to dip fries in. Falafel Express has a tasty kafta grill and staff is always nice. The Fountain Grill is good but pricey. Dolce Wraps is always a safe choice. Then for chains you have Aladdin's or Naf Naf Grill. I would go any of these places over Nate's Deli."}
{"text":"This place has the best Middle Eastern food I had while I lived in Cleveland.  That's not necessarily saying much, although I wouldn't be afraid to pit food from Nate's against food from any Middle Eastern place in the US.  The hummus is especially good.

If you don't like smoking, do yourself a favor and order takeout.  I probably took six minutes off my life by actually eating at this place four times.  (Secondhand smoke kills.)"}
{"text":"Wonderful hummus and vegetarian grape leaves. It's so nice to get takeout here and eat in the park down the street when the weather permits. Local gem."}
{"text":"Updated to include that Nate's now serves French Fries and takes Credit Cards.  Plus if you like Spinach Pies, Nates are excellent, flavorful dough perfectly baked with a rich spinach filling.

Most restaurants today want to be cutting edge and trendy, but there is a place for restaurants that buck that trend, places that have not changed over the years and go about their business serving good food simply and at reasonable prices; Nate's Deli & Restaurant is a a local favorite for just these reasons. This is a place that serves really good Greek and American food. When I need some good Middle-Eastern food cheap it tops the list. Nestled just down the street from the West Side Market at 1932 West 25th Street, Nate's is underwhelming from the outside looking a bit run down from the front. If you park in the parking lot in back and enter through the kitchen you get a chance to see how clean they keep things. Once inside you have a shotgun of a restaurant with booths on one side and tables closely spaced together on the other, there are a couple of small tables in the front display windows. While very clean and attempts have been made to warm up Nate's it still feels a bit crowded and dull, especially because the few colors that have been used are a very muted. But going to Nate's is not about decor its about food. 

Although the menu features a full deli side, I go to Nate's for the Middle-Eastern side of the menu, most times getting the same thing, a falafel roll sandwich and a half order of baba ganoush. The falafel is a bit simpler than most, just falafel balls rolled with lettuce, tomato and tahini in a pita. What makes it work is that the falafel are excellent, well spiced and lightly fried and then well balanced with the other ingredients. By using a large pita and rolling the sandwich, you don't have the problem of some falafels were the pita gets soggy and overstuffed. The baba ganoush is also very good, with a smooth texture and a nice balance between the roasted eggplant, the tahinin and the lemon. Served simply with a topping of olive oil, parsley and a little paprika and two large pitas to scoop into it, you couldn't ask for much more. But of course at Nate's there is more, since you get a side dish of pepperoncinis and pickled radishes to munch along with your food. The pickled radishes are the real treat, with their bright pink color, mild flavor and just the right amount of crunch. 

Nate's service is very fast and the food is consistently good, with prices very affordable. A couple other things to know about Nate's, they are only open till 5:30pm on weekdays, 4:30pm on Saturdays and closed on Sundays. Also take note of the little number on your table, when you are done you go to the register and give them the number and they will have the check. Nate's has been there seemingly forever, with good reason, they serve very good Middle-Eastern food at low prices and you can get in and out very quickly."}
{"text":"Best baba, hummus & falafel. Have been searching for something comparable since leaving Cleveland years ago"}
{"text":"Good food good service great price. Great for breakfast in the morning or a quick lunch. I have been hooked on their corn beef and pastrami combo."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill...
Once the pinnacle of Lebanese foods in Cleveland is now turning out low quality mass produced food.
Sysco anyone?
The servers have an attitude that is very unpleasant and I will not be back.

This used to be my favorite - but now is just another speck of mediocrity on the Cleveland food scene.

Apparently the dining room closes at 4:30pm
I asked if they could just let people know that by maybe putting a sign in their window like many businesses that display their hours?
But they won't put sign on their door saying \"everyone knows that\"
Well I'm part of everyone and didn't know that... thanks for the attitude waitress lady that I've overtipped for a decade and doesn't care one bit... thanks for making me feel stupid.
So instead of eating inside I sat in 95 degree heat with the pigeons... I shared my hummus and pita because I didn't have a choice.

Game over Nates
You are not the best anymore and it's sad."}
{"text":"I wish they were open till 4:05 it would be the only way I could ever eat there again."}
{"text":"Well done.  Arrived for an early lunch date and was immediately taken care of.  Upon choosing of our seat our server came out immediately with menus and offered us a drink.  Soon while sipping on hot lemon water I made my order for the hommos plate and my date ordered the baba.  Both done well, not too tart, not too bitter.  All in all a good lunch experience.  will come back for sure."}
{"text":"I have been here two times and loved it each time! Breakfast is really good and lunch was beyond my expectations!! I've also had the same waitress both times and she's on top of everything. They also have Pepsi and Coke products, which is a big plus in my book because I'm a Coke drinker. Seems like Pepsi is more popular here."}
{"text":"Just went for the first time for lunch the other day. If you like middle eastern food then this place is a must to check out! Service was top notch and food was the best middle eastern food I've have in Cleveland. We were greeted right away and my co-worker and I ordered the grape leaves, hummus and falafel plate. No joke, the food was out within 5 minutes after ordering! The portions are large and prices are cheap!

Just make sure to bring cash or a check. Also, if you go in the back door you have to walk through the kitchen - but don't worry all the staff is friendly and they greet you while you walk through."}
{"text":"1st time here. Shared a sample platter with my wife. Never had most of the items before so there is nothing to compare to. However, we ate EVERYTHING. It was all good, different flavors. Also, it was enough for two people! So, our bill, with tip, was just under $20, a bargain. Good thing since they don't take any credit cards. I would go back to try other items."}
{"text":"I really need to understand why everyone finds this place so amazing.   It's not.   You get frozen and microwaved falafel that's not even crunchy, fattoush that has hoagie dressing sprayed on it,  and the a dining room that's freezing since these owners are afraid of spending money on heat.   Never again."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is good.
The shawarma platter is worth the 45 minute drive it takes me to get there.
The falafel and hummus is good too."}
{"text":"I want to give 3.5! The service is good, the food is good, but the space is tiny. I don't mind a small restaurant but it's a bit claustrophobic. You could walk in the door directly into someone paying - literally hit them with the door. Then you turn immediately left into someone sitting at a table. I mean whatever, it's a small neighborhood joint but they could lose one table and feel more comfortable.

The choc chip pancakes were big and yummy, though no one will top Genes place. Potato pancakes are good but not crispy. I went with a friend that refused to eat them bc she smelt \"ammonia\" I don't know, she has a picky nose. I like them but they didn't blow me away, of course I douse them in apple sauce and sour cream so. The french toast is challah bread, so good!

I'd go back, I want to try some lunch stuff."}
{"text":"Amazing Food. Excellent Service - Consistent, Consistent, Consistent! Best go to place for comfort food."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Everything is excellent!  My favorites are the Fattoush Salad, Humous, and Baba Ghanoush. Pita is always fresh and delicious. Even better is the service. The staff goes out of their way to welcome you and interact, making you feel at home. Five stars!"}
{"text":"I love Nate's! I have been here a couple of times, but am finally writing my review.  The food here has been consistently good.  Its conveniently located near the west side market (same parking), and features an array of Middle Eastern food at a great price.  I got the falafel plate today and it was cheap, filling, and delicious.  Plus, our meal came with free pita, and after ordering an extra side of hummus, we left lunch feeling very satisfied."}
{"text":"the best quick lunch spot in all of downtown cleveland area... service is fast and very nice.. food comes to the table in minutes and everything you order is fresh and handmade....  plus you have to love any restaurant that is run like a well oiled machine.... all the middle eastern dish are to die for"}
{"text":"Usually Yelp reviews are overly generous with there stars but in this case they are well deserved.  I don't come to Cleveland without eating here at least once!  I only wish it was in San Francisco.  Great hummus, Greek salad,  and tabbouleh.   Great lamb, nice deli atmosphere with wonderful long time employees and wait staff (I've been coming here for years).   I use them to cater parties and business meetings occasionally so check this out if you are interested, it is always a hit."}
{"text":"Service is quick and friendly. Food is soooo reasonable and tasty (note: I only eat from the Middle Eastern side of the menu. They have american favorites as well) and love the little pickled veggies they give you. They bring in pita from Aladdins and you basically get that with everything, even if you only order a half order of grape leaves. They also take credit cards now :) Note that they are a family restaurant so they aren't really open for dinner. They close at 4 or 5pm depending on the day so it's great if you can get early take out but best just to do lunch there."}
{"text":"Best hummus I've ever had
I've been craving it ever since I first ate here a few weeks ago
Unfortunately, no credit card accepted
But good stuff nonetheless!"}
{"text":"While I don't live in Cleveland anymore this is definitely a must whenever I am home visiting family. You must try the shwarma hummus, fattouch, and tabbouleh... it does not get better. Their fattouch has sumac which is an essential ingredient that you won't find most places. Their hummus is also totally unique, I have not found a place that can do nearly as good a job- they must use dried chickpeas instead of canned and you can definitely taste the tahini. The lamb shwarma is also perfectly spiced and delicious. 

My mouth is salivating just thinking about it.... If you are in the neighborhood this place is definitely worth your while. My family has been coming here for years and the servers are always great- making sure you have enough of everything- despite being swamped. Nate's is definitely worthy of the 5 star Yelp review."}
{"text":"The hummus and tabbouleh wrap was completely delicious! The baba was a tad smoky flavored for my liking. Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"A middle-of-the-road rating for an seemingly not-middle-of-the-road middle eastern fare. Nate's Deli provides you with accessible and ecumenical approach to the Mediterranean delicacies. In this case, it's great and also... something of a hindrance.

We opted for carry out as a quick bite. I will remark, as others have, that the service was above excellent and speedy! In no less than ten minutes had the Falafel sandwich roll and Hummus roll along with tabbouleh salad been completed, ready for my departure. I was told that the lunch rush would be heavy but at 11:30am, I was in the clear for easy and quick service. 

Not accepting Credit/Debit is a must-know to first-timers here and could be seen as a detractor, but it doesn't take away from the food. I found the wrap/rolls to be adequately stuffed but with more pita than filling. I did like the addition of pita with the tabbouleh salad however (which in itself was just right). The ingredients seemed fresh and crisp, but the mixtures left something to be desired.

Nate's is going to be a nice place for you to come in on any afternoon for a brunch or lunch with good people. Expect great service and awesome value! While I echo a great deal of what others have written, I am hard-pressed to give Nate's above three stars. My main reason being that, as good Mediterranean food is difficult to find, just because a place stands outs in a small market, it doesn't make it amazing. 

In short, Nate's will fulfill your falafel fervor. Will it stuff the pita pocket that is your stomach? Most undoubtedly so. But don't let the romance of the decor and toasty flat breads fool you; While this may be the best Cleveland has to offer, clarify whether you have a love or lust for Mediterranean food before you decide."}
{"text":"All time favorite I have been eating their falafel sandwiches for years, when I moved away from Cleveland I would always stop by Nate's for a lunch time falafel wrap."}
{"text":"Nate's is arguably one of the best lunch spots in the city. 

I've had multiple of their rolls and their shawarma (add feta + garlic sauce) is unmatched by any I've had elsewhere. The place has the feel like a family has let you into their own home and everyone is very welcoming. I usually just order takeout which has some of the quickest service I've gotten anywhere and my food is ready for me when I arrive every time."}
{"text":"good middle eastern food, especially the raw kibble!"}
{"text":"Been going to Nate's Deli for breakfast for over a decade now, and I like the place!  I'm all for supporting locally owned 'mom and pop' eateries and restaurants, rather than the more expensive ripoff national or regional 'chains'.  Nate's is no exception.  I usually have a cheddar cheese and veggie omelette, and theirs is exceptional!  Big, thick, fluffy and stuffed to the hilt.  Their coffee tastes freshly brewed and good as well, and their home fries are decent.  The only constructive criticism I would give Nate's Deli is that they use way too much butter in those home fries, which can tend to the greasy side.  Tone it down a little bit guys, so your customers'  hearts can keep on ticking!"}
{"text":"Been going here since I was a child.. Best shawarma and chicken in Cleveland! I love everything they offer here and they are always quick and so nice!"}
{"text":"Terrific. A bit of a hole in the wall, this place is great yet doesn't come up on the radar. We were biking, stopped in at west side market, and our friend walked us over to Nate's. We had Baba ghanoush, tabbouleh, fool, and hummus with fresh pita. Perfect. Informal, quick service. Not upscale, and that's just fine by me. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"nate's is one of my favorite lunch spots. the food comes quick and tastes amazing. the chicken shish tawook and baba ganooj are my two favorite dishes."}
{"text":"Awesome food, quality and service! We catered food from here for my son's birthday party. I always worry that caterers will be late but they arrived before I did and patiently waited for me! Thanks guys for being on top of it and delivering delicious food!"}
{"text":"I loved the hummus here.  It had a nice smokey taste to it.  And, with the big bag of pita bread they give you, it was even better.  Along with the hummus, we ordered the baba ganoush, tabbouleh, and fattoush to share. I also had the chicken shish tawook sandwich.  It was tightly wrapped in a thin crisp pita. The restaurant itself makes you feel at home.  The servers were really nice. On my way to the restroom I saw family members in the back kitchen cooking and prepping food including grandma.  I will definitely return here when I visit Cleveland again."}
{"text":"If they are not randomly closed for a vacation, or closing almost an hour early because they feel like it, you will receive poor service and even more disappointing food. 

I've been eating here for over a decade and it's sad how far downhill this place in gone. 

Rather then bottomless pita as they used to have, now a large order of humus comes with only two pieces. Their kibbee used to be my favorite, now it's soggy, bland, and lacking in any pine nuts. 

As much as I hate to say this, as this used to be one of my favorite places to eat, go elsewhere where you'll get more value for your money and service that makes you want to return rather then walk out before your food even gets to the table."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was six years old and they have never disappointed. I recently moved to California and every Saturday morning Nate's crosses my mind because I miss them so much! Totally recommend the Humus, grape leaves, and the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Such friendly, fast service. Falafel sandwich was great -- and so cheap! And the hummus bowl was HUGE. Great simple lunch spot for the whole family."}
{"text":"Don't be confused, Nate's Deli and Resturant offers both american and middle eastern foods, open only for breakfast and lunch.  The diner is very casual, food was delicious yet simple, and the serves was warm and motherly (a lot of \"honey\" and \"sweetheart\").
Hummus was smooth and creamy, tangy, pinched with parsley, dashed with paprika and a drippled of olive oil.  It's served with commercial pita bread heated from the plastic bag. Delicious yet simple. All for $2.75. (Later that night, I wish I could jump back in time.  So I could have ordered some hummus togo) 
I order a gyro (I like hogpog meats) and bf ordered beef kabob.  Mine was smeared with dill-less tzatziki, over what appeared to be re-heated gyro meat and crispy white onions blanket in a warm, chewy thick pita bread.  I finished it.  The bf enjoyed his selection. I thought about it, I already knew what I wanted to try the next time--tabbouleh and baba ganoush."}
{"text":"My old man and I would always come here before or after shopping at the Market. The only thing that I would eat as a youngster was the hummus. The hummus is better than any of the homemade hummus that my Arab friends Mom's make. An order is around $5 w/ a few slices of fresh pita. Everything that I ate at Nate's has been good. As someone already mentioned, bring cash, no credit cards accepted."}
{"text":"I dream of baba ganooj! I recently went to the west side market to make a little picnic with a friend and she kept checking out the hummus and other dips in the market. I insisted that we walk over to Nate's Deli for their baba and hummus. It's just the best! The beef shawarma and pickled vegetables are also amazing. I'm never disappointed. It's just a great spot to get great food!"}
{"text":"Nate's is a wonderful local lunch place. The place is always busy for dine-in and very popular with take away as well. 

They do participate in delivermefood.com's service (a third party restaurant delivery service), but there are order minimums that depending where you want it delivered may be hard to meet when just getting lunch for one. I couldn't meet the $30 minimum for my neighborhood so I called in an order. I was impressed that I was given just a 10-15 minute wait time when I called at noon. 

I ordered the Shawarma Plate on Hummus. It was served (see photo) in a rectangle to go container. It was completely filled with hummus and then layered with thin and small chopped pieces of well done beef. It was wonderfully flavoured with onion and parsley. I was given three full sized soft circle pitas with it - way more than I needed, but one is great to have so you can mop up all the left over hummous with it. Even with taking hummous with each forkful of meat there was so much left at the end to dip the pita in. 

Wonderful filling lunch! If you've not tried Nate's definitely make a visit soon. They only take cash, but there are two banks on the same block as them. Friendly and fast service and my order was ready in the time frame given and despite being super busy was handed to me with a smile."}
{"text":"I order from Nates for lunch during the week. Always made quick, warm and with lots of flavor."}
{"text":"Best Lebanese food in town. The fattoush salad is to die for. The decor is somewhat drab but appropriate for an unpretentious, old hometown favorite. Service can be a bit frenzied at peak times, but the woman who served us on our most recent visit was fun and sweet. Did I mention the fattoush is to die for?"}
{"text":"Cant believe I have never been here until now, its the \"place to be\" of Ohio City. Everyone was very nice. Hummus and Tabouli were very fresh and good both around 5$. I grew up having lots of Arab friends, I myself am 1/2 Arab and all of their Moms would have Tabouli and Hummus on deck. Point being, I know freshness when I taste it and this is some good stuff! They gave us a whole bag of Pita and they said just take it for the road, which isn't a huge deal, but they could have been cheap and snatched it back up. Baked Kibbee with rice was about 8$, good portion, even better taste.

Almost forgot, CASH ONLY!!! I still owe my friend 12$ =-0"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years.  15+ years to be exact.  Had lunch here today.

When you walk in at lunch you can seat yourself if its slow.  They seat you at busy times.  You will have to sit at a table representative of the number in your party.  You can't sit at a 4 top if there are only 2 of you and so on.  Place is small and they utilize every inch of space here.

 I usually come in through the back door.  You walk through the kitchen to get to the seating area.  If you have to use the restroom you also have to walk through the kitchen.  Several cooks are busy prepping and cooking all the time.

Nate's has a middle eastern menu on one side and a deli menu on the other with soups and sandwiches.  I usually order from the middle eastern menu like I did today.

I ordered a half fatoosh salad and shawarma platter over hummus.  It is served with warmed pita, pepperoncini, and pickled turnips.  The fatoosh is like a chopped salad with several small pieces of lettuce, parsley, tomatoes, onion, etc.  Dressing is light and delicious.  Hummus is creamy and smooth.  I get notes of lemon and garlic.  The beef shawarma are tender strips of beef that are cooked perfectly in a rich marinade and served over the hummus.  

I have also had their wraps.  Falafel.  I've been disappointed by nothing here.

Service is friendly and efficient.  When you are ready to leave just go to the counter and tell them your table number.  Those are on the table.  You check out at the counter.

Nate's is outstanding.  I'll be eating here for another 15+ years."}

{"text":"Surprised.  And disappointed.   Maybe it was a fluke, and just this take-out visit.  Granted, several years have passed, but this was nothing at all like the typical 4.5 to 5 stars from about 10-14 years ago, when we came here fairly regularly for terrific breakfast dine-in and sandwich take-out. 

The results from this last visit two weeks ago were due to 1.) careless mistakes, 2.) an employee's revenge, or 3.) Nate's Deli being on one extreme diet, because their formerly formidable Pastrami and Reuben sandwiches have slimmed down considerably.   

My favorite---Reuben---was once a huge-enough-to-be-shared or eaten-over-three-rounds heavyweight champion of corned beef, kraut, and melted swiss.  Now that he's trimmer and much lighter---more a welterweight---he's not at all intimidating.  Gone is that large, lovable, squeezable, moist and juicy, hard-to-resist quality---and he just isn't as corny and as yummy-tasting, either.  Compared to Joey the Mover in Rocky River (great spot, otherwise) and \"Piled high, but DRY\" Slyman (down for the count), Nimble Nate was once a fierce corned beef contender.

We all expect the cost of foods to continue rising steadily, along with restaurant prices, but SERVING SIZES from delis---of all places---should not be shrinking.  The last direction we'd want to see them trending toward are healthier, lower fat, child-size adult portions.  Minimalist delis will never compute with any stomachs' hard drive anytime soon.   While it's a widely accepted fact that enticing, aromatic delis are not the healthiest destinations, and much like cigarette packs, should probably have a large Surgeon General Warning sticker plastered across their doors, these are the spots where we throw caution and common sense to the wind, and look forward to indulging ourselves.  

Eating healthfully is definitely a good thing---and can often be great-tasting and satisfying---but after a while, that admirable virtue can be a drag.   Sometimes our bodies actually seem to require deadly sodium or cholesterol gut-punches.  Fatty meats...salty pickles...mayo-slathered potato salads...oils...butter...and gooey cheeses...all that dangerous but delicious delicatessen fare.   These two sandwiches didn't put us anywhere near unsafe levels.  In fact, their modest sizes were much like I'd put together on my own kitchen counter.

When craving a FAT FIX from a heavy deli sandwich, we expect a FAT FIX from a heavy deli sandwich---not something from an approved list recommended in a Jenny Craig or Weight Watchers restaurant guide."}
{"text":"We entered through the rear entrance which allowed us observe the kitchen in full swing.  The preparation in the kitchen got me really excited for lunch and the prices on the menu made me want to order everything. Their are certainly prettier restaurants from the outside, but for the $ this is probably as good as Greek food can get."}
{"text":"I can't express how much I love the food here. The chicken shishtawook and shawerma sandwiches are so delicious you could cry. When I travel to Cleveland, it is the first place i stop after the airport! I would fly there just for the food. Love it!"}
{"text":"I'm an idiot. I've been seeing this place at the top of Cleveland's go to restaurants for years and neglected to go. For some reason, I can't say why, I finally gave it a try and was so pleased that I did. Here's the highlights: 

Service is very friendly and fast, which are two of my biggest requests, particularly for a lunch joint. Despite the fact that this place is obviously very popular, the staff have worked out a very good system which keeps everything very efficient. You can choose any of their many tables in the restaurant, after which a server will greet you and provide table service, but afterwards you pay at the counter using your table number. I personally prefer the type of service offered here for lunch as I like the benefit of getting table service, but not having to wait around for my check when I need to get going. 

The food itself I wouldn't classify as remarkable per say, however I found it to be a very filling and well balanced meal for the price. I chose the falafel platter, which is priced at $6.50 for a medium sized plate with falafel, lettuce, tomato, parsley and dressing. This dish was extremely filling, and would have easily filled me up on its own, however they will also bring you Lebanese pickled turnips and pita bread. I also got a side of tabbouli for $3.50. As I said, this isn't so far off from similar Middle Eastern restaurants I've been to, but I couldn't fault any of the food I had and would definitely come back considering it seems it's very consistent. They also have fresh brewed iced tea made the traditional Lebanese way with rose water, which pretty much rocks my world. 

As a whole, I really see myself returning here again and again knowing that I can get fast, affordable food with great service. I don't think I would rate this as a top restaurant for out-of-towners, because as I said, it's nothing out of the ordinary, however I tend to favor restaurants I know I can count on for lunch as I'm often in a hurry and Nate's fits the bill. I am definitely looking forward to coming back on my lunch hour."}
