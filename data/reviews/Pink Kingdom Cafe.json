{"text":"Went with my boyfriend to take their kingdom challenge, the sandwich was so big it could feed a party or 5 each. We got 2 of them because we were going to challenge each other to see who won but after it came out, we ended up realizing we couldnt do it. It was the best sandwich I ever had. So much meat and delicious toppings and cheeses. I was sick of it after like 12 huge bights cause i was so full but now i constantly crave it. Good thing they are right around the corner. I ended up eating more than my boyfriend but our pictures are on the dungeon of shame. If you think u can eat, i dare you to try it. The pound and a half of loaded  fries doesn't help much to win. It was just soooo much food. The workers and managers were amazing. They all kept taking pics of us. It was so much fun. I had to take a cig brake in the middle of the race, thankfully the worker had a lighter :). Might be my last food contest since i couldnt keep what i ate down lol, thankfully i did till i got home, but not my last time ordering that sandwich there, just a much smaller version. The resteraunt was so clean and nice, we are so happy the opened up."}
{"text":"This place claims they serve breakfast not only on yelp but on the sign mounted to the front of the building, they do not serve breakfast. When I asked for the breakfast menu I was told \"we aren't that company no more. \" just the use of proper English would have given this 2 stars..."}
{"text":"Very stark atmosphere and a menu that's all over the board.  Not sure about this one. The Italian sausage sandwich seemed to have been microwave, chewy on the end.  Service was fine."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open, and it didn't disappoint.  It was a later lunch on a Wednesday but there were still a few tables seated.  The prices are fantastic, the various sandwiches are $7.99 and come with a side and a 20 ounce drink.  I had the Italian beef with French fries.  This was an ENORMOUS sandwich.  I couldn't finish it, and I'm not usually a guy that fails to finish his lunch.  The sandwich is piled very high, but the meat was a little tough in spots.  However, when combined with the jus, it was fantastic.  I recommend getting your sandwich wet and getting more jus on the side.  It's not only flavorful, it adds a nice moisture.  For the most part, the bun can stand up to the additional liquid.  The giardiniera is fantastic, crunchy with some nice heat.  I recommend you use this liberally.  The fries were homemade, and it showed.  Crunchy but fluffy on the inside.  There was bits of peel still on the fries, which I love.  They needed some salt, but that was about it.  High quality fries, we will definitely get these again.  The breakfasts looked good, so we'll definitely have to give it a try.  Overall, great value, very friendly service, and good food.  Hopefully Henderson supports this place, it's a great addition to Water Street."}
{"text":"All I can say is AWEOME! Hot dogs were amazing, the fries where fresh cut, the atmosphere was friendly, great service and definitely a place to go back to again and again to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Mediocre. I've eaten lunch here twice and the food was okay but nothing special. The fries were soggy and the sandwich bread started falling apart halfway through my meal. The price point is comparable to other sandwich shops and the service is reasonably quick. Unless the food gets a lot better or cheaper soon, this place won't be able to compete with all of the chain restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"I was a fan of the previous company but what has replaced it needs some serious work.  The experience was lacking. There's a funky smell in the place that reminds me of the stuff the chemicals they use in porta pottys.  The guy who took my order walked around in a faded tshirt and flipflops.  Flipflops!  But when another guy used a cloth to wipe the floor and then I saw him use the same cloth to wipe the counters I was somewhat hesitant to eat my order.  But the gyro was tasty hence the extra star but there was only two small strips in the pita but the pita was good quality. If they cleaned up the place and offered a little better value for the money spent, I'd be willing to give it another go."}
