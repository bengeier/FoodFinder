{"text":"First time to this restaurant, thanks YELP!!!

We did really enjoy our lunch! You really have to try their deep fried calamari! Well cooked!

Great service and friendly environment!"}
{"text":"First time here and pleasently surprised. Calamari was worth the trip alone and the entres didn't disapoint. Wife had the chicken slovaki dinner which was moist and full of flavor. The Greek salad had an unique twist with a dressing that wavered from the traditional Greek salad dressing. The creamier version was a nice twist for me, however left my wife wanting more traditional.  I enjoyed the classic Gyro on a pita and it was right on point.
Not overly expensive but not a super bargain either. What you would expect from a place on the Danforth with the convience of close to the 401.
Definatley wouldn't hesitate going back with friends or a dinner for 2."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious and unique Greek fare that is *especially* notable for the unusually inexpensive menu. Given the generous portioning and reliable quality of the food, I'd have expected literally everything to cost $5 - $8 more than what they charge. A hidden gem in the West End!"}
{"text":"Had a lovely meal this evening at the Krystos Restaurant on Dufferin Street north of Lawrence. The appetizers were delicious and served with fresh warm pita. The Greek salad
served with the meals were delicious - good dressing and lots of feta and olives. The lamb souvlaki was excellent as was the grilled calamari.  Too full for dessert! Will have to return. Who knew there was such good Greek food so close to home.
In addition, the server was attentive and delightful and the food was delivered promptly."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch while shopping and was pleasantly surprised by how good the meal was. I just had a basic Greek salad with chicken but the dressing was perfect, the salad crisp and chicken was very flavourful. Def going back"}
{"text":"Really expensive for Greek food - I`d rather take the drive to the Danforth than eat here ever again."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend for dinner. Restaurant was about half full. It was just us waiting in line to be seated - we waited for about 30 minutes. Not a single waiter or waitress offered to seat us though they walked right past us countless times. They wouldnt even look at us when we tried to get their attention. We just ended up leaving. Waste of time lol."}
{"text":"Have been once before. The food was pretty good but small portions. I ordered a \"large\" beef souvlaki platter, and I totally thought they scrimped on the beef. Instead, there was a pile of not-so-great rice and potatoes. I can't imagine what a \"small\" order looks like. The spanikopita was amazing, though. Anyway- I placed an order on JustEat.ca last night, for delivery. I Ordered the food at 7:45pm. They estimated I would get my food at 9:15pm. I live 5 minutes down the road. I placed a $65. order. Food arrives at my door, we pay cash & tip, the woman delivery driver leaves. Open the bags. The whole order is wrong. And it's almost 9pm. And we're all starving- having waited over an hour for our food. I was so angry. It upset everyone in our home. So I called the resto. Was put on \"hold\" for 5 minutes. Spoke to Manager or Owner Domenic. He gets in touch with the driver (who turns out to be part owner, apparently). 10-15 minutes later, she shows back up with our order. She offers to leave the other food (the wrong order), as well as our correct order, but we decline and return the other food. She apologizes and says that the next time we come in, just tell them who we are and we'll get a discount. Whatever. At that point, we were so irritated and hungry, we didn't care what she had to say. What WOULD have made me happy was if they had refunded me my money on the spot. Why should I -the customer- have to pay (full price) for cold food that arrived late because of their screw-up? BULL."}
{"text":"Went last night for dinner. Food was delicious!  We had the Saganaki OPA!!  Yummy!!!  They didn't have the Coconut Shrimp do the waiter substituted with Garlic Shrimp.  Simply delicious!
We had the Beef Souvlaki and the Spanakopita Dinner served with Greek Salad of course. Both very good and large portions.  The staff was very kind and friendly. Definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"We received out of this world service from our waitress, and the food was very good. The potatoes were the best Greek potatoes I've ever had!"}
{"text":"For a late night meal, our group went to get something a little more Mediterranean that was preferably not at Yorkdale mall, and Krystos made the cut.

Coming in, the décor is decidedly modern, with big screen TVs showing multiple sports on a Friday night.  We had a fish roe dip to start, and I had the grilled calamari appetizer.  We had differing opinions on the dip, as I thought it was too fishy, while my two other friends liked it.

The grilled calamari though was out of this world.  The flavours and saltiness level is spot on, with a good level of char, and finished off with sautéed tomatoes and onions.  With a lemon garnish and a side of pita bread, it hit the spot.  The olive oil on the tables are from Sparta by the way, as the menu reminds you."}
{"text":"Was there for lunch by myself this past Monday. I had the small chicken souvlaki platter with a bottle of Stella Artois.. Food was excellent and fresh, portions not huge and service very friendly. I could say it is a very needed addition to the neighbourhood, however..... what Greek restaurant has no Greek coffee? No baklava? No PORK?????? And they were not doing gyro but that will change apparently. But really.... they apparently had Greek coffee when they opened a little more than a month ago but took it off the menu? I was told that they have no pork to accomodate the Jewish population as well as the muslims? Come on, so if I go to Egypt or Morocco, will  they have pork on the menu to accomodate me? No? I thought so. A restaurant cannot be everything to everybody. A succesful restaurant accomodates clients, but not by altering the very essence of its cuisine. This is a recipe for failure. This establishment has pleasant and efficient staff and the food is excellent. But they should not alter what they are,  thinking it will bring in more business. People who do not eat pork for religious reasons would never go to Krystos, or any Greek restaurant, for that matter. This place is needed in the Lawrence-Dufferin area, especially now that the population and density are increasing. However, if it cannot be a real Greek restaurant, it will close soon enough. I plan to go back and see if they improve."}
{"text":"The grilled calamari was not very good value. Portion was small for price and not done very well. The calamari wasn't that fresh.

The chicken souvlaki dinner was delicious. The chicken was done perfectly. The whole dish was delicious and the Greek salad was very good too. Would definitely order again.

Baklava was somewhat disappointing. The nuts were a bit old, you could taste it. The whole dish was just very wet and sweet but wasn't very flavorful."}
{"text":"My partner and I both ordered the chicken souvlaki dinner and it was great! The salad came out on its own and the dressing was surprisingly tasty and a good size. The chicken was very tender and had a great flavour, so did the potatoes and rice. And the side of tzatziki was small but also very good. would definitely eat here again. The restaurant has simple and nice decor and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"Went there on a quiet night.  Modern, clean.  Incredible portions.  Very classy.  The pricepoint for entrees was just right on (most south of $20, as I remember), which means one doesn't have to think about going there as a 'big night out' sort of thing.  Quality was outstanding -- better than the usual run-of-the-mill Greek fare.  One of the owners happened to be serving.  He took the time to talk about the growth of the restaurant, the take out/call ahead option, expansion, etc.  Just an around positive vibe."}
{"text":"Our first time here and we were surprised. Nice atmosphere. Delicious food. Modern interior design. Very nice and welcoming personnel. I will definitely come again and will recommend to everyone. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This place is a solid 3 for a few different reasons; I'll start with the good:

It's a decent looking restaurant, it was busy, customers looked happy, and there aren't many Greek options that I know of in the area, making it a great local option. 

The food was just ok. We ordered 3 dips to start, they were ok but not even close to a place like Astoria, which is one of my favorites for Greek dips. 
Mains:

My wife got the mousaka but we waited so long (more on this below) that she only took a bite or two. Lucky for me, I get to eat this all myself over the next couple of days! lol 

I got the gyros and this is where it all went sour.... I would expect a place that serves \"modern Greek cuisine\" to sell real gyros not the \"Chicago style\" minced meat type you can get at the food court at a mall... I expected Messini type of gyros and I got Jimmy the Greek. I will also be eating most of this over the course of the next couple of days because we pretty much took all our food home with us. 

They probably forgot our order, we got our apps quickly but then waited an hour for our mains. They definitely made an effort to make amends, we were pretty positive throughout the whole night... it was Saturday and not in a real rush to leave but they could clearly see they messed up. Long story short we go an AMAZING light, airy baklava for free and that made us happy too. I probably wouldn't go back because I'm a real hard ass when it comes to food in toronto. I have too many places on my list of go-to's for Greek to ever consider this one again. I definitely wouldn't discourage anyone from going here if they live close by. Like I said, a solid 3."}
{"text":"The good: The staff, although not always knowledgeable, were willing and patient with modifications. My husband ordered souvlaki, which he said was very tasty.

The bad: I ordered a Greek salad with dressing that tasted like Kraft. The dip platter felt similar. Nothing tasted homemade, but at home made prices."}
{"text":"Loved the octopus, chicken was on point too. Killer salad dressing  really liked the flaming cheese, and the show that came with it. Had a few of there house cocktails they were balanced and delicious. I like how it's more trendy compared to other greek spots I've been too. Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Honestly- i have had better souvlaki in a food court. One would think when walking into a giant restaurant as this- can probably seat 100 people or more- it would be exceptional. Nope!

Servings were medium sized. Fries were Mccain- we even got the greek option. They were not generous with the toppings at all-quite the contrary- stingy!. Which beats the whole point of greek food- where the point is over indulgence. We ordered the shrimp platter- I think the person who created the menu does not know what platter means. Or is a genius for using the term platter and convincing me that for $22 - i shouldn't expect more then a bowl of rice some grilled veggies and 6 shrimps. 

Now it was not all bad- Shrimp was delicious and i really enjoyed the Saganaki!!! OPA!!!

However- i wont be back. With so many Mediterranean cuisines's around the area. This can be over-looked.In North York-  If you want fancy- Messini is one of the best greek food. Late night or for a giant fullfilling portion- try Esquire. If you want really good souvlaki - try bella at bathurst and finch also Orly's at bathurst and sheppard!

MEH! MEH! MEH!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and plan to come back based on my experiences. Great friendly attentive staff - first time I came for a late bite and the chef came out to watch our reactions to the dips he made fresh for us. Gluten free pasta options and everything is made fresh. Amazing flavour and clean fresh atmosphere. Authentic Greek cuisine! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Stopped in to meet an old friend, to catch-up on old times and talk some business.

My friend was the one who suggested Krystos.

If you are driving south on Dufferin, you might miss it - its in the same building as Red Lobster.

I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food.

We had a few things to nibble on, Calamari and several dips with pita.  The food was better than I expected.  The Calamari was amazingly tender and the dips were very flavorful.

I'd go back again and try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, typical Greek. It was served fresh and in good time.
The restaurant decor seemed fairly nice but a little aged."}
{"text":"The food tasted ok but it's way over priced and the quality isn't great. I was hit with the craving for a souvlaki platter so went here for lunch. What I wanted turned out to be $18 on the menu (absolutely crazy compared to the same thing for $7 at Lawrence Square and not even the places on the Danforth charge that).I settled for the \"mini souvlaki platter\". It had two small pieces of potato, a spoonful of rice, four pieces of chicken and a tiny pile of salad for $11. Do the owners understand they are serving rice, potatoes, and chicken? These are some of the cheapest foods you can buy. Why are the prices so jacked up? The chicken was dry and tough (to their credit it is advertised on the menu as local and free-range. That's nice. ). The rice was bland. The potato was ok. There was no pita or tzatziki. The menu also boasts that they use \"high omega 6 olive oil\". Since when is that a good thing? Omega 6 causes inflammation. Most of us are trying to get it out of our diets. Not to mention the health benefits of olive oil exist because it is high in omega 9 fatty acids, I don't know if they typed the wrong thing or if they went out of their way to find a mutant lower-quality olive oil. Either way, that turned me off too. I probably won't go back. Mr Greek is 1000% better."}
{"text":"Walked in for dinner for a seemingly unprepared and limited staff.  

Had to wait for someone to clean off a table in order to seat us.  Didn't flip past the second page and already has the waiter asking us what we wanted.   

Both ordered the soup of the day: Lentil Soup.  Had never tried it before but it was a nice start for the meal.  Served in a nice dish to top it off.  

Lamb souvlaki was definitely the best choice I could've made.  Simply delish.  I ordered medium-rare and wasn't disappointed.  Came with rice and sliced lemon potatoes I believe.  

The salad that came before was also pretty decent.  

Very filling and decent portions. 

Decor is nice but a little much.  When I look up I see an exposed ceiling like a warehouse.  Great contrast? 

Good food. Crummy service.  They could've used one more person at least.  Had to wait for the check after all the dishes were collected.  Usually implied?  

Not dying to go back.  There are plenty of Greek restaurants out there to be tried."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner last night. Mixed review. Ordered 3 dips to start. Main meals were simple. 1st person-Chicken souvlaki salad, 2nd person-small Greek salad + lentil soup, 3rd person-moussaka Dinner. 

After ordering, it was over a 1/2 hour before we saw or heard from any server. We finally flagged down a waitress (not ours) and asked if they've forgotten about us. Our waiter came by with an apology explaining that the kitchen was very busy with Uber Eats orders and he said our dips would be coming out momentarily and he would remove them from our bill. 10 minutes later the dips came out. Chili peppers and feta cheese, babaganoush, hummus with soft warm fresh pita bread. They were very good and we were starving by then. 
The mains followed about 15 minutes later. Greek salad would have been good had it not been drenched in dressing. I ate the top but could not eat 1/2 the salad that was swimming in oil. Next time I would definitely order the dressing on the side. The chicken was slightly pink inside. The moussaka was rich and bland at the same time if that's even possible. The lentil soup was the winner. Huge, hot, tasty. 
I'll give this place one more chance, maybe through Uber Eats next time, since they seem to prioritize their take out over their sitting customers."}
{"text":"Been passing by this place for a year. I finally gave it a try.. and nope it wasnt worth it.

Over priced small portion ok-ish greek food served in a empty restaurant. Id go to danforth area next time. Rice was ok, calamari ok, sea bass was ok, salmon was not ok, salad was not great, beer was ok. But then again, beer is usually ok."}
{"text":"Went here a couple weeks ago, the food was okay and the prices were very expensive in my opinion. I wouldn't go back, there are so many other great Greek places out there."}
{"text":"Incredible service and food, we came here on a not so busy night and our family and friends were treated like royalty. Our server knew his stuff and gave many recommendations and tips of leftovers too! 
Portion sizes were above and beyond and the flavours were incredible. Truly an incredible experience and when we return to Toronto we will be back."}
{"text":"Came here last night for take out, Looked nice inside so I thought the food would be worth a try. Two chicken souvlaki dinners and two can of pop cost $39 dollars. When I finally got home I opened up the container to see a very boring looking meal. The rice smelled like it was already starting to decompose. The chicken had no flavor, and the potatoes were just horrible. If I could rate my meal in the negatives I totally would. this place needs its food to be re assessed because what I ate was complete garbage. I wouldn't even pay $5 for what I ate last night. Never coming back or never would recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch recently because I was in the neighbourhood running errands and their sign said \"Fast Take Out\" - I thought why not.. I ordered the chicken souvlaki lunch (1/2 order) and when I got back to my office, I was very disappointed with the meal. It was a good portion, but the food was just meh. The Greek salad was basically a bunch of romaine lettuce with one piece of tomato, one piece of cucumber, some feta cheese and a couple of olives, absolutely DRENCHED in some weird tasting salad dressing. I guess this is the \"modern\" part - since Greek salad should not have salad dressing on it, nor should it have lettuce. 

The chicken was very tasty, but the rice & potatoes were, in my opinion, not very good. The rice had a bizarre texture - like it was either overcooked, or leftover from the day before. 

I am more of a traditionalist when it comes to Greek food, so I'm going to stick with the authentic spots instead."}
{"text":"I'm so glad to find a Greek place I would actually consider coming back to. A clean bright modern space with friendly and thoughtful service. Our server even clarifying when we wanted each dish to come out. There is an extensive menu to choose from, with some more unique items I haven't seen elsewhere.  I would recommend the moussaka,  which was really well flavored and my friend liked the grilled calamari. Open late, so a good place to grab a bite after a movie or shopping nearby."}
{"text":"Nice casual place with friendly staff. I had lentil soup which was simple, lemony, and hit the spot.
Then I had the spanakopita which was simple and tasty (not gf or dairy free so I suffered later, but enjoyed it while I ate it).
Hubby had the chicken souvlaki in upgraded salad. It was huge but he said chicken was moist and flavoured well."}
{"text":"My family and I were so impressed with the service we received today. The food was amazing! Great value, great environment overall."}
{"text":"Umm... Just so good !!! I don't have to go to Greek town :)"}
{"text":"Think this is the original location, I could be excused for being a tourist.

Your typical Greek decor and food, and what they do best is chicken souvlaki.  Extra star for the value, with greek salad and choice of rice or potatoes, which I chose the latter.  Believe me, being Asian, I've had plenty of rice to last several lifetimes, as I only eat rice maybe once a week when visiting parents.  Then again, I eat sushi 2-3 times a week, so that's enough as it is, but let's digress.

For $12, this is a deal!

The baklava dessert is totally what I wanted instead of the Paramount, where that was  dripping in honey or syrup of some sort.  Don't get me wrong, that was yummy too but here, it's light and fluffy, as I asked for just for the flakes ;)

Bonus for accepting Amex.

Delivery/takeout available.

Friendly service."}
{"text":"Large, open space with clean interiors. Ordered the chicken souvlaki dinner and mousaka. Greek salad was delicious as the dressing tasted uniquely home-made and not your typical bottled salad dressing. Chicken was juicy and as per their menu was not cooked from frozen. Mousaka was flavorful although presentation was not the best. Prices are decent for portion sizes."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing, portions are pretty good for your prices! Staff was fantastic and the restaurant was clean and cute! I would recommend this place to any family's looking for a night out!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here last Friday with my family and was amazed by how great the food is!  I beleive its a new restaurant.

I ordered the lamb pita.  But, we also ordered appetizers, the fish dinner, a specially prepared meal for my wife who is Vegan / gluten free, amongst some other things.  You can only imagine how difficult it is for us to eat out! :)

Everything we got tasted fantastic.  Some of the best Greek food we've had.  The prices were reasonable, the service was superb and most importantly they were very accomodating to my wife's dietary restrictions.

This has easily become one of our new favourite places and we'll definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"I am shocked by all the great reviews... It was ordinary... I've had better Greek. I was also turned off by the small portions. I am lover of Greek food and have only been there once and live so close"}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner late lunch eat. My boyfriend and I were working nearby and wanted to sit down for a nice meal. 

We were greeted immediately and seated. We got to sit anywhere we liked as the restaurant only had one or two table taken. Bare in mind it was 3pm on a Sunday. 

We ordered the calamari which was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The portion size was perfect for two people. We ordered off the dinner menu so the prices were a bit more for a late lunch but understandably so. I had the lamb souvlaki and my boyfriend had the beef. The Greek salad came out first which was great to eat first so our main dish wouldn't get cold. The main dish came with rice and potatoes. The rice was average but the potatoes were taste to perfection with the lemon. The portion size was more than enough where we bought home leftovers. 

Parking was good, the atmosphere is different as I am use to traditional Greek decor but it was done classy. For the most part the decor was clean and sharp. 

The service was good. No complaints. 

For a Greek restuarant in Toronto I would go again if I was in the area.

Overall a good dining experience."}
{"text":"My sister's friend showed us this restaurant after our bridesmaid dressing fitting and I was hesitant as the reviews are quite low for this restaurant.

Kyrstos has it's own private lot and the interior of the restaurant is spacious, modern, and clean.

We came during Winterlicious and ordered off that menu.
For $23 we got an appetizer, main, and, dessert.
1. Lentil soup - which was okay but my boyfriend said it was fake (lmao).  It had a little bit of a kick which I liked.
2. Chicken souvlaki dinner - it came with the salad and the dressing was amazingggg!!! The chicken was moist and tender.  The rice was flavourful and filling.
3. Berries cheesecake - I didn't like it as the crust was really hard and falling apart and the filling felt like it was cream cheese.

I took .5 star off for the dessert and .5 for the wait time at the end.
My sister had a bridal fitting at 4:30PM.  We waved our waitress down at 3:50 for our dessert. At 4:05 the dessert still hasn't arrived so we asked for it to go and get our cheques.  At 4:15 we got up and walked to the cash to pay our bills as our waitress had mysteriously disappeared.  We literally picked up our dessert at the kitchen window as my sister was panicking at this point. 

Overall, I think there wasn't enough servers to accommodate the very moderate lunch rush.

4 stars because I'd definitely be back for the chicken and the salad."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a weekend and really enjoyed it! 

Staff was very friendly and attentive and the restaurant was not too noisy and was able to accommodate our large party. 

Ordered a standard souvlaki dinner and it was delicious! The rice and potatoes were great and the chicken was juicy and seasoned very well. 

Would definitely return to this location in the future."}
{"text":"Hot, fresh, quality food. My fiancée and I dropped in earlier today for an amazing lunch. The food came out less than 10 minutes after we ordered and everything was excellent. We had the chicken souvlaki dinner and the chicken souvlaki salad - we were thoroughly impressed with both meals and are already planning our next visit to this little known gem."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE THEIR FOOD GAVE ME E. COLI POISONING
I ordered their chicken souvlaki dinner for supper a couple days ago and woke up in the middle of the night with unbearable stomach pain. I threw up profusely about an hour later and most of the food hadn't even been digested by my stomach. The hospital confirmed it was E. Coli from the restaurant using contaminated lettuce in their salad. They informed me that there is an E. Coli outbreak in lettuce right now and that restaurants have been warned about it and told proper measures to take to prevent spreading the virus. Will never eat here again and warn anyone against eating their food. Any restaurant that is willing to ignore important health issues like this and continue to serve contaminated products is not one that can be trusted."}
