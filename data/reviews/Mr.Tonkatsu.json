{"text":"Food: 8/10
Service: 8/10
Value: 8/10 (10/10 if you like cabbage salad, rice and miso soup)

Close to the original quality and flavours you find in Japan. 
Service is very friendly but not very efficient (little slow going around in circles)

Food is good.  
Tonkatsu is crisp outside and tender and juicy inside.  
Free rice, miso soup and cabbage refills. 
Miso soup could be better. 
Cabbage dressing not so good. 
Tonkatsu sauce is good (they provide sesame seeds.  Don't forget to grind them to release the oils. Test by smelling before and after grinding)
Tip: put some of the left over sesame seed on the rice to enhance the flavours 

Price is ok for most of the menu but the chicken karaage is overpriced. 

Overall a good place to fix your tonkatsu cravings."}
{"text":"Awesome!! Gave 5 star on the Bathurst and Bloor location and this location deserved 5 star as well! Great tasty and great service."}
{"text":"I ordered a pork loin with cheese set for $14 and my husband ordered a beef set for $13 or 14. Both were very good. The meat was fried to perfection, crispy to the last bite. The beef one was essentially Salisbury steak breaded and fried. And the pork loin was pounded out piece of pork loin with mozzarella cheese then breaded and deep fried. I didn't expect how tender mine would be. The portion was a good size, I had trouble finishing my lunch. It was a bit expensive for lunch but worth it because it wasn't too busy and service was fast and friendly.  I would go there again."}
{"text":"Came with a girlfriend in the evening, and despite it being prime dinner time, we were able to be seated relatively quickly. The menu is very straight forward, and let me tell you, if you don't want tonkatsu, then you turn around and leave. While there are some non-katsu items, almost everyone comes here for that one thing.The katsu sets come with your choice of battered meat, as well as bottomless miso soup, rice, and cabbage salad. 

We tried the pork loin and chicken katsu, and were not disappointed. The katsu batter is so crunchy without being oily, while the meat manages to stay juicy and tender. This is almost some sort of witchcraft. 

And then there is the novel part of the meal, where you prepare your own dipping sauce. Each person is provided a dish with some sesame, and instructions to grind the seeds with a mortar and pestle, before finally adding it to the tonkatsu sauce. I must say the roasted sesame did give it a nice flavour. 

Restaurant was clean, service was quick, and did I mention there was a CHEESE-FILLED tonkatsu? Honestly, there isn't much to complain about, and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I ordered one fish katsu and one crisp chicken wings with spicy source to go. After I arrived at the restaurant, the waitress gave me the bill with two chicken wings main and tried to persuade me to pay for that. I ordered same things for several times, this is the first time got the wrong one. However, she still thought she was right! By the way, my fish katsu become cheese katsu......I don't know if the waitress pay attention to her work or not. But, I don't want order meal from this restaurant any more......"}
{"text":"Best tonkatsu in Toronto! Tried both the pork sirloin and chicken cutlet. Miso soup, rice and salad are unlimited. The staff was friendly and super helpful."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, great service, very reasonable price

Food was delicious and you also get unlimited refills on rice, miso soup and salad. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Large portion of dish and I like the shredded cabbage-tastes light and very healthy.
Very authentic Japanese fried chicken and steamed sticky rice.
Staff is friendly-She knows things and greet you with a smile."}
{"text":"Definitely the best chicken Katsu I have ever had. The restaurant is small and gets packed pretty soon so I would recommend arriving earlier than usual to reserve a table. 

Everything about our meal was fantastic."}
{"text":"Great place, the Katsu tenderloin was delicious and with their sauce it created a whole different taste that was wonderful. Amazing service, very nice people. Interior was also very pleasing to be in."}
{"text":"First time here today. I had the plain pork loin katsu while my friend had the chicken with cheese katsu. The cheese one was definitely tastier while it was hot! Overall the meal was good, everything tasted fresh and the waiters were prompt. -1 for the price though, lunch and dinner menu is the same. No lunch specials"}
{"text":"Their karaage was super tender and juicy, and the coating is light and not at all oily. It had a really nice crisp texture too. As for the katsudon, the pork itself is not dry and is actually quite moist. I wish there was more of that sweet katsudon sauce for the rice, though. The pork loin katsu with cheese set was really delicious. The melted cheese layer underneath the crunchy breading really adds a nice texture component and dimension to the whole dish.The tonkatsu sauce with the little crunchy bits of sesame seeds is perfect with this pork katsu w/ cheese."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place as the restaurant we were trying to go to was closed for renovations. 
It's a cute little place with fresh crunchy fried foods. We ordered a Katsu Pork Tenderloin Curry and the Honey Butter Chicken. 
Both were delicious, especially the Honey Butter Chicken.
We will definitely return in the future when we need a low key no fuss delicious meal."}
{"text":"I will probably go back just for their crispy juicy chicken wings, or even try the spicy chicken burger. The pork loin cutlet was a bit on the dry side, and the sauce came with the tonkatsu set was very mediocre."}
{"text":"i love katsu, and i'm pretty particular about it. this place does it justice. i ordered the katsudon ($12), while my cousin ordered the chicken katsu set ($14) and we shared some karaage wings for an appetizer ($5.50). we both also got miso soup. all in all, i thought the prices were quite fair: we were both stuffed by the end of the meal. ~20$ (with tax+tip) for a meal isn't something i'd do every day, but it's a nice treat that doesn't break the bank, either. 

we were lucky that we came a bit late for lunch on a sunday so we didn't have to wait for a table, but it is a small location so making reservations for busier times might be a good idea. we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Crispy and tender tonkatsu, cute decor and super friendly service. Perfect if you're looking for a casual bite before catching a movie at Hot Docs, though I would probably go there all the time if I lived in the Annex."}
{"text":"I went there randomly and choose the Sirloin katsu set. I came in around 5pm and was seated immediately. The place was clean but definitively small. I sat at the kind of bar in the back of the restaurant.

The Sirloin was very crispy. The miso soup and the cabbagewere perfect side dishes in the katsu set. I just found the menu on the internet and realized that the soup, cabbage and rice were refillable. However, the superstar of this meal was the dipping sauce with the grounded sesame seeds.

Right as I left, there was a huge line up to outside of the restaurant. Luck of the draw!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner recently and it was delicious!! Nothing like it in the city. Staff very friendly and attentive, restaurant was very clean, bathrooms too which is important!! Will go again for sure"}
{"text":"Wow... These tonkatsus are MUST try! It was hot and super crispy. Their homemade salad dressing has unique taste (sesame oil). My wife and I ordered cheese tonkasu. Mr. Tonkatsu is very generous with their meat and cheese. Also, we ordered the honey butter fried chicken A.M.A.Z.I.N.G.!!! Super crispy and the meat is juicy and tender. This place is 10/10"}
{"text":"Food: Both the sampler (get to sample sirloin, tenderloin and chicken) and Tonkatsu with cheese set were dry, food portion was small (expected that going in).

It wasn't a busy night, if the food we had was the norm. I have no clue why yelp has such a positive rating. Maybe we were unlucky or people had low expectation. Other Tonkatsu places downtown are charging $9-12 range and this place charges for $14 (same piece of meat).

However the service was good. And remember the sides (soup, rice and cabbage are refillable). We has to order 2 rounds to be not hungry!!!! Normally an order of korean soon tofu or a bento box would fill me to the top.

Place: Tight seats like other Japanese noodle places, expect to over hear tour neightbours full conversation.

Surely I'm not returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Best tonkatsu I've had outside Japan! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The menu here is limited as one would expect so make sure people you meet here know that. I found that all the meat dishes tasted the same so I dont feel the need to go back. My guests enjoyed their food but I dont think they were overly happy either.The service was terrible and the waitress did a poor job of explaining items before the entire staff vanished for the next hour. We had to go up to the front to ask to pay (and have our table cleared). Next time I would rather a Korean grill or an Iizakaya to this place."}
{"text":"The food was great, service was fast, staff were polite, decor was welcoming. I came here alone for dinner during my dinner break and ate the pork loin katsu. The way it was plated was perfect so that the katsu wouldn't get soggy on the bottom so it was crispy throughout. The center bit was also nice and juicy. I definitely really enjoyed the salad dressing, which you add yourself and control how much you want instead of the chef drenching it. However I didn't love the sauce for the katsu (but I never like it in general). They let you grind your own sesame to put into the sauce which was cool and fun, and also ensured that the sesame wouldn't get soggy in the sauce. I'd like to come again and try the cheese stuffed katsu which looked delicious as well."}
{"text":"Second time here. I ordered their new item. Forgot the name, but basically it is Iike a chicken don.
It has an hot spring egg on top. Jab it with the chopstick and the yolk will spill out? permeating into the pork and rice. Heaven.
The sauce in the rice is really good, together with the   Onion is awesome. 
As for the pork, l am not really a fan of it. But it is good. Since it is my second time, I will say there quality is consistent. 
Again, nice service, clean and cute"}
{"text":"great atmosphere. love the all you can eat cabbage and miso soup. 
pork cutlet was on point."}
{"text":"I haven't had a bad meal yet!  I never realized that there were so many variations of tonkatsu! All excellent!"}
{"text":"Amazing fish Katsu! Everything is so fresh fried! Lovely environment! Will visit again for sure!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this restaurant and was in the area with the boyfriend so we decided to give it a try. I ordered the regular katsu and the bf ordered the cheese katsu. Both were really food and bf enjoyed it as well. Service was good. Got our food fairly fast and server was always attentive in filling water and giving refills of cabbage, soup, or rice. Would recommend it for sure!"}
{"text":"Love the food here :) from the tonkatsu to the salad to the miso soup. Everything was really delicious for the price. And the server was very sweet as well. Before I forget to mention, my friend and I were seated immediately once we stepped foot into the restaurant. It was a nice atmosphere. I would definitely revisit again!"}
{"text":"As the name states, It specializes in tonkatsu.  Tried their regular katsu set, the flavour is ok, nothing extraordinary.  Shredded cabbage is a bit dry, floured pork tenderloin is crisp outside but the meat is not as moist as I had hope.  Personally I think it's a little too lean for my liking.  Soup, salad and rice are refillable, but the overall flavour tends to be dry so I wouldn't want to ask for more.  The service is friendly and helpful.  Although it is conveniently located near my place, I probably wouldn't visit often considering there are cheaper and more flavourful Korean options nearby."}
{"text":"Feels like we're on vaca in Japan again. Pork tonkatsu was on point. Chicken karaage was moist but I've had better. 

My only gripe is that I wish they offered unlimited cabbage salad just like they do in Japan. Helps to cut down the fatty fryness.

Would definitely come back, but just for the tonkatsu :)

Update: They now offer unlimited rice, miso soup, and cabbage salad. They have earned their 5th star :D"}
{"text":"Have been there twice already and both times I am impressed with how tender they cooked the pork! Unlimited rice/cabbage/miso soup too!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and had the chicken tonkatsu. They have unlimited top ups for the miso soup and shredded cabbage. 

I found the tonkatsu just average. Service was average as well."}
{"text":"Have you ever had trouble deciphering the difference between tonkatsu and tonkotsu?  Well, you're in luck because Mr. Tonkatsu will set you straight.  It's a shrine that worships the Japanese fried pork cutlet (tonkatsu), not the milky broth of ramen (tonkotsu) that some, the unfaithful, would confuse it with.  Their pig mascot dressed in Japanese garb and armed with a sword is yet another subtle hint that pork clearly is their specialty, but you are welcome to choose other fried Panko-battered cutlets (or \"katsus\") such as chicken, beef, or fish as part of your set. 

The tonkatsu sampler consists of pork sirloin and tenderloin katsus as well as chicken katsu, a great set for the indecisive.  The waiter explained that the pork sirloin is the most popular katsu and also has the \"softest\" texture.  As expected, the pork tenderloin was \"firmer\" but it was still quite tender in its own right.  Regardless of preference, both cutlets were juicy.  The chicken cutlet was on the bland side but there was a sweet and sticky sauce in a teardrop vessel to remedy that.  As an added novelty, you grind your personal supply of sesame seeds with a mortar and wooden pestle to give your sauce extra flavour and aroma. 

The best feature of the katsu is still the crispy and far reaching deep fried Panko batter exterior.  Admittedly, although tasty, the batter holds a good amount of oil.  It's not as light as it could be but at least the katsu sits on a metal rack to allow excess oil to drip through and to preserve it's crispiness.

Accompanying the katsu is a bowl of miso, shredded cabbage and steamed rice, sides which are all refillable.  The shredded cabbage is incredibly dry and bland, perhaps to absorb all the grease from your katsu?  It's a moot point though, because you end up drenching the cabbage with sesame oil dressing anyways.  

Nevertheless, the wait staff are friendly and attentive.  Without even looking up, our waiter replenished our sauces by squirting them directly into our bowls!

You can't say Mr. Tonkatsu is not dedicated to their craft but be prepared for a heavy meal.  It's a relatively good option when you have a craving for fried food but it can be off-putting otherwise as everything on menu, including the appetizers, is deep fried.  Unfortunately, the cabbage doesn't help.."}
{"text":"Great cosy place for good eats!  We had the tonkatsu sampler and fish katsu and both were delish!  Light and crispy, not greasy!

Recommendation for a cheap meal.. Both were $14 with refillable miso soup and cabbage salad."}
{"text":"Mr. Tonkatsu is a wonderful, peaceful little spot, just west of Bathurst Station. It's a lovely place for a quiet dinner for 1, or a small group. The service is friendly and enthusiastic and they are happy to instruct on the best way to eat tonkatsu. 

While the pork isn't very flavourful (I have high expectations of the other white meat) it is very very tender. The portion sizes are more than adequate, and if you are used to something larger, the miso soup, cabbage salad, and rice all come with free re-fills.

Why they didn't get 5 stars:
*The home-made panko coating doesn't always stick to the pork - it sometimes ends up in the sauce.
* The dressing for the cabbage salad - while plentiful - lacks balance ad can make for a very salty mouthful
* Free re-fills on everything except the one thing you will really want an extra order of - the really good tonkatsu dipping sauce.

If you want deep fried protein without feeling guilty about the grease, this is a great option."}
{"text":"I got the Cheese Tonkatsu for take-out. The tonkatsu itself was very tasty. However, the portion was WAY too small, and the paper that came under the tonkatsu stuck to it a bunch, which forced me to eat paper without even realizing it. They also give way too little tonkatsu sauce. I can't speak of this place for dine-in, but I know I won't be getting take-out again."}
{"text":"the katsu is so good, but one of the waitress have certain attitude.. And we don't know why... Maybe she had a bad day, the food is so goodddddd!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. I would say the portion was definitely smaller than Katsuya but the quality is still great. I loved the tonkatsu sauce and the ground sesame seeds in the sauce too! Would come back!!"}
{"text":"Planned my entire day around coming to Mr. Tonkatsu.  Brought the whole family and parked about a km away.  Got seated right away and placed our orders.  We all ordered their staple chicken katsu. After two minutes the server comes to our table and tells us they only have one katsu left and three of us would have to reselect.

Can you imagine running out of your staple item 2.5 hours after you open for the day.

Needless to say this experience has left a sour taste in our mouths.  Long drive from Pickering only to end up at Popeyes across the street."}
{"text":"The Tonkastu dishes were very delicious! But unlike other Japanese restaurants the waitresses there were not as patient."}
{"text":"Yummy! I had the pork loin Tonkatsu set, which comes with rice, shredded cabbage, a miso soup and dipping sauce for the Ton. The tonkatsu was soft and juicy. This was only 13$ and the meal was Japan level good! I would recommend this, if you crave this excellent dish."}
{"text":"My 2 favourite things, modern looking restaurants and KTown.

Coming to Mr.Tonkatsu I didn't really have high expectations since I've had a lot a lot a lottttt of katsu's in my day. My review gets a little complicated.

The whole environment of Mr.Tonkatsu is warm and welcoming, with the most happiest wait staff you will ever encounter. The experience is a little different, for example, I've never been to a restaurant here in Toronto that specialized in JUST katsu, if there is, someone let me know! The sesame seed grinding thing too is what bumped up my star rating. I know it's a little silly and sounds a little gimmicky. But the fresh sesame seeds mixed in with the katsu sauce is devine. It really kicked the sauce up a notch!!

In all honesty, no, it's not the best katsu I've ever had. It was the most visually appealing katsu I've had. I'm not saying it was bad, because it was great, it's just not my number one katsu! Though, it is my number 2! So that's a pretty big thing. For the curious, my number one katsu is at First Markham Place. Inside the actual food court at the Japanese booth with a meek Japanese lady behind the counter.

If it's not the best katsu I've ever had, why am I giving it 5 stars? Because of the customer service. Mr.Tonkatsu's customer service was so respectable that it will be my reason for returning again.

I went with 3 other friends here for our first time, and after everything was said and done, they had run out of rice!! It's rare that this kind of thing would happen, but hey it happens! They said they were making a fresh batch of rice, and it would be a 15 to 20 min wait. In all honesty, we weren't pissed off because well ... That's just how long it takes to make rice. If I were alone or just with one other person I could see myself getting impatient but when you have good company time just flies.

Roughly 10+ minutes pass by, and I think the owner could see us getting a little antsy. So he steps up his game and provides us with the most FRESHEST, MOST DELICIOUS fried rice I have ever had. It was just me and one other person in my group waiting for rice, but now my other 2 friends wanted it as well! The fried rice was just THAT good!! Mind you it's not actually on the menu! LOL

It's not the super yummyness of the fried rice that bumped this 4 star rating to a 5, no it was the customer service. The fact they cared enough to cater to their paying customers is why I will always rave about this place. I for sure will be coming back here!!"}
{"text":"This was my second time coming to Mr. Tonkatsu. The first time I came I got the chicken cheese katsu, which tasted great! This time I decided to try something different and got the pork tenderloin katsu. 

The katsu was very tender, juicy, and crispy. It wasn't dry and thin at all like the typical katsu you'd eat at ayce sushi restaurants. With every order of a katsu set, you get a bowl of rice, cabbage, miso soup, and tonkatsu sauce. Before you get your food though, they gave you sesame seeds which you get to grind up yourself and will be used for the tonkatsu sauce. This is apparently the traditional way of eating tonkatsu. I love sesame seeds, so the process of doing this was fun and it made the sauce even tastier!

Ok I'm gonna dedicate this entire paragraph to their salad dressing. I'm not even sure what it is. I'm guessing there's some sesame oil in it but whatever it is, it tastes BOMB. This stuff is sooo good that I can literally chug it straight out of the bottle (I didn't though). Got extra rice left? Drizzle some of that dressing and eat it. No joke. That's what I did. The salad dressing is da real MVP.

The staff was nice, friendly and patient. After we finished eating, we stayed for a good 45 minutes just to chat and the staff had no problem with us doing so."}
{"text":"I had a cheese tonkatsu  lunch. The portion is rather small. The tonkatsu is a bit thin. I don't like the sauce for the tonkatsu. The sesame thing doesn't add much flavour to the tonkatsu. It's def not the best tonkatsu I've had. I don't plan to go back."}
{"text":"I found Kara age curry. I have been dying to eat this . Clean timely service . They do free refill of soup , rice and cabbage . Fantastic"}
{"text":"Love love love the tonkatsu here!  I got the one with cheese and it was delicious.  Just the right amount of crunchiness and not dry at all.

As a gimmick they also provide sesame for you to grind prior to the food, though if truth be told I can't taste the sesame in my dipping sauce at all.  

Rice/salad/soup is also refillable, which is great!  When it isn't busy I would refill a few times and the staff is always super friend and do it with a big smile."}
{"text":"I would give ten stars if I could. I was trying to find a place to eat dinner in and I saw Mr. Tonkatsu. I ordered regular Tonkatsu, first they gave me a bowl filled with sesame seeds to crush and to put in your tonkatsu. Then your Tonkatsu comes out with rice, miso soup and finally shredded cabbage to eat with delicious salad sauce. The Tonkatsu was very crispy. I truly say that this was the best dinner of all time."}
{"text":"A Japanese restaurant in the Annex area that specializes in Katsu. Since they specialize in Katsu, I had high expectations. I was not disappointed. The meat was well breaded and evenly fried. The meat was very tender. The meal comes with free refills of rice, salad and miso soup which is great."}
{"text":"THE best tonkatsu I've ever had! What a delightful surprise.
We had:
- tenderloin katsu set
- Japanese style karaage
- Korean style karaage
- calamari (on the house)
 
The tonkatsu was by far the best out of everything we had. Karaage was good too. The squid was very fresh. Overall, all the ingredients seemed fresh. Highly recommend this place. Skip guu and come here for some amazing cutlets!"}
{"text":"The best tonkatsu I have ever had! Their menu is short, simple, and well thought-out. Their unique take on katsu don features caramalized shoyu onions, a poached egg, and tender breaded pork and it is delicious. If you don't like katsu (breaded meat) then this isn't the place for you, but if you do like it you have to try here. Service is friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"I don't care how tasty your food is...here is why you get a terrible review.  Ignore me as I stand inches away from you for 10 minutes waiting to be seated...here I am thinking you're ignoring me because there are no tables...oh wait...there are a few and you're just ignoring me.  Argue with me that what I'm ordering and reading verbatim off your menu isn't correct and isn't what I had the last few times that I've been there...and yet when I finally get my order it is exactly what I wanted.  Make us repeatedly ask for plates when we're sharing items.  Don't ask us if we'd like something to drink...just make us repeatedly ask for that also.  If I wanted to have to order everything I needed instead of table service I would have gone to McDonalds....at least there I would have been asked."}
{"text":"Katsu fan? Come here! No, really, come here for good katsu. They even have the little mortar and pestle bowls for grinding up the sesame seeds to add to the katsu sauce. I like to eat katsu whenever it's on the menu, and there was such a great selection here. There's standard katsu, but also katsu with cheese. The atmosphere is clean and neat, good for small groups. The service is very friendly and FAST. If you're a katsu fan, you NEED to come here.

Never tried katsu? Do you like Japanese food? Yes? You need to eat here. You need to try katsu done right."}
{"text":"Once I ordered, I was hard at work grinding the sesame seeds. 

After my hard work (and a little bit of sweat), my meal came. 

I ordered the pork loin with cheese katsu since I've never tried katsu with cheese. It came on a big plate that had rice, miso soup and cabbage. All three of those are refillable. Sadly, I asked for more sesame seeds and they said no. Oh well.

The miso soup was kind of watered down and had not much taste to it. Rice is rice. Cant complain there. Cabbage is cabbage although I enjoyed it with the salad dressing. The port katsu was hot and fresh while the melted cheese is in the middle of the katsu. The katsu and the katsu special sauce were definitely the real highlight of the meal. I can literally dip anything into the special sauce and eat it. 

If you pay by credit or debit, you have to get up and go to the counter to pay.

Oh, and one last thing, awesome logo. Oink, Oink."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place out because it had great reviews on yelp and I was going to be on Bloor Street. My friend ordered the Pork Katsu and it was exactly what it was supposed to be, but she would've liked more spices in the sauce for it or a spicy option for the sauce. I had the Fish Katsu, which came with tartar sauce. It was pretty good. This was my first time having Katsu and I liked it, but I wanted more flavor from the food. It felt pretty bland to me, but if this is what Katsu is supposed to be then maybe it's just not for me. All in all, I'm glad we stopped here and that I tried it. I definitely at least recommend going in and trying it for yourself. The service was great and quick."}
{"text":"They have two main pork cutlet option, loin and tenderloin for a dollar extra. The tenderloin was absolutely worth the extra dollar. It was considerably more tender than the normal loin. Their cheese stuffed cutlet was also worth the extra two dollars if you're a fan of melty string cheese. Don't forget that there is an infinite refill option for the salad + rice + miso soup. Extra cutlet cost $8 but you have to order with the base cutlet set.

If you don't feel like spending $13 - $15, a cheaper but also delicious option from this restaurant would be the donburi for $10. Overall its a nice place to eat for lunch or dinner, great atmosphere, great food, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great food! We got the tenderloin set and curry. Very tasty. The only downside was that during our visit, something happened to their rice and they had to turn it into fried rice, and then the second batch of rice was very undercooked. I don't think this is a common occurrence though.

Make reservations if you're able to, unless you don't mind waiting in line for half an hour."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the deep fried chicken & deep fried tenderloins pork. Do not be shine to ask for more rice, miso soup, and the seeping sauce! 
*p.s. They have really good miso soup!! =D"}
{"text":"These guys and girls know how to fry food. Best crispy fried squid ever. It was crispy, tender, and not salty...also just perfect.
Their pork tenderloin classic was perfectly fried too. The pork inside was so tender that you can probably eat it without teeth. The sauce was a great match. Oh, the interior design is great but the seating is limited. Overall, best fried food in Toronto and you really need to give this place a try to understand how deep fried cuisine can be an art."}
{"text":"This for me is a treat yo self kinda place. The food here is dee-lish! Some of the best Chicken Katsu I think i have ever had, ever.  But I Have to say 35-40$ for two people without drinks is kinda pricey for me to do all of the time. 

Though I think it is a bit steep for what it is I still love coming here from time to time. I love the dining experience here! They give you a little mortal and pestle to freshly grind your own sesame seeds to go in the Katsu sauce, How much fun is that? Interactive meals like this are always a great experience.   You also get endless miso soup, rice, and cabbage on the side which is a nice plus. 

I always get the Chicken Katsu but I think next time I'll try the Kimchi burger- Yes please!"}
{"text":"small place. so gotta come at a good time 
service and environment is nice
I had a donburi with poached egg. since I had no sauce. it was a little dry. 
their cheese tonkatsu looks good. would want to try again"}
{"text":"Sometime I crave for deep fried pork, aka, Tonkatsu! 

This place is so far the best in Toronto to meet my craving.

Start with grinding your own sesame is very neat idea! If you weren't hungry yet, that smell will help you work your appetite!  

Tender loin katsu is also good! It is more juicy than loin katsu and very flavour full. 

I am very surprise to find they serve a very good quality Miso soup! And it is free refill! Amazing!

Cabbage salad were very yummy with their house dressing, I usually at lease refill once!

Damn, mouse watering as I am writing this review. Guess where I am going tomorrow, Lol"}
{"text":"It's a nice place overall! Clean, nice service blah blah blah. Great date place for younger people. When I was there with my friend, there were a lot of couples in their 20's sitting there and chatting. The waitress was polite and she kept asking us if we were enjoying the food and if we needed anything. The deco was nice too but the place is a little squishy. The tables were quite close to one another like my friend and I were sitting pretty close to the couple next to us.

Now the important part... The food!!!! It was freshly made and the sirloin steak was crunchy on the outside but a tad dry on the inside. I think it's because the meat is lean and lacked fat content (since fatty meat or muscle meat is juicer). The daikon salad was nice. Same with the dressing but the dipping sauce for the meat sucked. It tasted like a ketchup mixture with something else (slight horseradish flavour if my memories are right). Personally I don't see anything special about this place in terms of the menu and taste. The menu was quite small with identical items... Mostly fried meat. The portion is pretty small. I ordered the combo ($12) and afterwards, I was still hungry.  If I were to eat until I was full, I'ld probably need to spend $30+. Price wise- not really worth it.

Overall, it is a fusion place targeted towards younger people. Great for dates and just a place to sit down with someone special.
- Small portion
- Decent food- taste and texture wise
- Small menu 
- Good service
- nice ambience 
For my rating, i weighted the taste and portion size more heavily so I give it 3/5!!!"}
{"text":"Came back again because I quite enjoyed the food the first time around. I got the fish katsu which comes with a different sauce (tartar vs. the katsu sauce with sesame seeds served with the pork and chicken options). The fish was fried perfectly and the filet was light and fluffy. We also ordered the honey butter fried chicken to share between the six of us and it was delicious.

Either the server or kitchen staff forgot one of the orders and as a result one of our friends had to wait much longer before he finally got his food. They apologized and gave him a can of Coke on the house which I thought was a nice touch. Service was definitely slower than last time but I wouldn't hold it against them."}
{"text":"I have come here on 2 separate occasions and have tried the tonkatsu sirloin and tonkatsu cheese. Both were A-Ok, but not something I would want to go back for often. I do like how you get to grind up your own sesame and mix it in with the tonkatsu sauce. There is also a sufficient amount of veggies on your plate to make you feel better about eating a giant portion of fried pork. The tonkatsu was well fried, crispy and not greasy at all. The meat itself though, although it was good quality, wasn't very moist or flavourful which I think is the one thing that prevents this place from being truly memorable.

Generally, this is a good and unique tonkatsu specialty shop! If you enjoy tonkatsu this place may be for you. I did prefer the cheese tonkatsu over the sirloin so it is definitely worth the 1-2 extra bucks.I also saw a sandwich menu for lunch ( I came for dinner) so I may be inclined to try that out on a subsequent visit. Overall, would return if convenient, but would not go out of may."}
{"text":"I went here without much expectations -  after all,  how good can fried cutlet be? I was wrong -  the pork loin cheese katsu with curry was the BEST katsu I had!  It is very close to the katsu you can get in Japan.  I would encourage everyone to try this meal."}
{"text":"Kinda like a Japanese \"fast food\" eatery. Had the pork loin katsu with cheese inside. The pork was very tender and crispy. Was very tasty with melted cheese inside. Free refill of rice, cabbage n miso soup. The homemade katsu sauce was also tasty with grinded sesame seeds. Service was good. Space was a bit small tho, very close to the person next to you.."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and I've never been disappointed. Some of the best katsu I've had and not overly expensive. I ordered the Pork Katsu and my friend ordered the Pork Tenderloin, as well as the chicken wing appetizer. All were delicious, with the tenderloin being much more... well, tender. The wings weren't really needed because the katsu set was pretty filling (comes with rice, salad and miso which have free refills!). I appreciated the cute presentation of the katsu served on a metal rack. They also let you crush your own sesame seeds for the katsu sauce which I found satisfying. Our bill came up to about $40 including tax for two people."}
{"text":"We were quite pleased with our meal here!  It felt like being in Japan with the grinding of your own sesame seeds, the yummy tonkatsu sauce, and the unlimited miso soup, cabbage, and rice refills!  The tonkatsu itself was fried to perfection!  Crispy and not greasy at all.

My only criticism would be the cabbage sauce.  I expected it to be less heavy with sesame flavour, maybe more sweetness and tanginess would've been more what I was expecting.

Overall, great place!  I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place is solid! The food flavour is amazing and a definite palate pleaser. Drink specials are good deal and pair well with the dishes. Service is friendly and pretty quick. I really like how you can see the kitchen and the food being prepared. Very fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Solid!

I have had tonkatsu in Japan, so I knew what to expect, as well as the fact I may be let down. The first thing I'll comment on was the service.  This can go very many different ways, and often times as a white chick dining in an Asian restaurant, I feel a bit ignored or under appreciated as a customer. This wasn't the case here, and I even felt comfortable and welcomed enough to ask some direction to ensure we ate the meal the way it was intended to be eaten:

- salad dressing sauce on the table goes on the cabbage
- ground sesame seeds go in the brown sauce that comes w the Katsu

I like how w the meal, we got unlimited Miso soup, rice and cabbage. The Sapporo paired PERFECTLY w the pork - we both preferred the less expensive pork loin to the pork tenderloin.  The soba noodles were not worth the extra $1.50 or whatnot, i wouldn't recommend them (and I'm a soba fiend). 

Overall, very good. I'd go back for sure!"}
{"text":"We had the chicken and cheese katsu with squid appetizer. Both were pretty tasty but there definitely wasn't enough squid and while the chicken was pretty tasty and nicely breaded, it didnt seem worth the price. 

We had take out and I have to say the service was really nice. They let me sit down even though it was pretty busy and gave me water while I waited, and kept apologizing for the wait, even though I didn't even wait that long, so pretty cool there. Extra star for the really nice service, which wasn't expected at a busy place like this, especially when getting take out."}
{"text":"I came across this place while looking for a place to grab a quick bowl of pho and decided to try it out because the name and store front were cute and a little quirky. The place was more or less deserted in the middle of a weekday so the service was quick. I ordered the original pork tonkatsu set and I have to say, the cutlet was cooked to a perfectly crispy outside. The sauce was also quite good and I like that you get some sesame seeds to cut the tanginess a bit. One thing that I didn't quite like were the sides. The miso soup was good but the cabbage was just raw shredded cabbage with no dressing or anything so it was very dry and pretty tasteless. Unfortunately the meal was quite heavy and the cabbage was the only fresh thing or vegetable on the plate. A salad with japanese dressing or something would have been a better alternative to raw, dry cabbage. There also could have been more variety on the menu (although I should have guessed from the name of the restaurant) because pretty much everything was katsu but overall it was a good meal. The service was okay but I decided to stay a little bit after I had finished my meal since I had some time to kill and the place was empty and I could definitely feel their eyes on me which was awkward. 

If you're specifically looking for a great fried pork cutlet, definitely check them out, if not....well maybe this place isn't for you."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch because we were craving some curry!

I got the fish katsu, which came with all the regular accompaniments (salad, miso soup, and rice) but with tartar sauce instead of katsu sauce and sesame seeds. The katsu was super crunchy, which I liked, though there wasn't a lot of fish as the cuts were pretty thin. At times, it felt like I was just biting into a chunk of panko.

My friend had the karaage curry. The bite-sized pieces of chicken were perfectly cooked and the meat was super tender. The curry was pretty good, had a bit of a kick but not much. It wasn't outstanding.

I've been to several other curry places in the area and Mr. Tonkatsu is a solid choice. Mr. Tonkatsu has the best meat (well cooked, juicy, tender, etc), Katsuya has the best sauces/curry (in terms of variety and originality), Gyugyuya is the best value in terms of price vs. quality, and Kaiju (which is closed) had the best balance overall."}
{"text":"Still our default place for tonkatsu in Toronto. Definitely not as busy as it used to be. Got there around 6pm and we were the only table at the restaurant. The servers still managed to busy themselves with other things than to serve us (there were five of them and two of us -- so they tried really hard to avoid us). The food is still good. Had the pork tenderloin and it was, well, tender. I always through that their soup could use work -- why not a pork bone soup instead of miso. Maybe it's just a North American thing ... go to Japanese restaurant, must have miso."}
{"text":"Mr. Tonkatsu is A-Ok. There was nothing wrong with the service, we were seated quickly on a weekend afternoon for lunch (just two of us - the restaurant is quite small), but the menu and the quality of food didn't wow us.

We ordered the Original Tonkatsu set, comprised of Pork Loin Katsu with cabbage, miso soup, steam rice, and homemade tonkatsu sauce. The cabbage, miso soup and rice are free to refill ($12.80). The oil that the katsu was cooked in left a residual oily taste - perhaps the oil was a bit old? The flavour of the sauce wasn't a favourite of mine, nor was the salad dressing. It was Ok. Between katsuya, which is a similar katsu resturant, and Mr. Tonkatsu, I would highly recommend Katsuya."}
{"text":"My favourite place for non-sushi japanese restaurant. I especially love their pork cheese katsu, which is not something that you see in many japanese restaurants. Cheese coating between meat and fried bread crumbs added a twist to a dish that otherwise would taste pretty standard. Their dish size is very big (pork cheese katsu comes with rice, salad, dipping sauce, and miso soup). Everything except the meat is refillable too.

The service is pretty okay. They don't bother us too often and mostly only come when our drink needs a refill.

If you like chicken or pork katsu, definitely check out this place."}
{"text":"This place is essentially perfect!

Took a while before I finally got to try this place after seeing great reviews online. Rare to find a restaurant dedicated to tonkatsu in Toronto. This place gets it right. I ordered the pork tenderloin tonkatsu soba set.

The soba came first. While it was just plain soba, with some nori on top, it was tastey. Then, came the tonkatsu with rice, shredded cabbage, and rice. Everything was just delicious. Right down to the rice. Everything was perfection. Even the shredded cabbage felt fresh and tastey. On top of that, this place has a kickass sound system playing top 40 songs.

Fast, clean, great food, and fantastic vibe.

Will be coming back for more for sure!!"}
{"text":"Seriously, sometimes the first words out of the hub's mouth when deciding a place out... \"Mr. Tonkatsu?\" This place has the best curry tonkatsu in town - deep fried succulent meat in a hearty curry. The only item I haven't liked so far is the kaarage curry. Maybe the pieces weren't thick enough? The chicken was dry and chewy."}
{"text":"Best pork cutlet place in Canada!!
MY wife and I have tried Korean style chicken, tonkatsu,shrimp and squid last sunday.
Every food was very crispy, tender and tasty.
We couldn't help falling in love this  restaurant.
 I especially love dipping sauce is so tasty on tongatsu. Homemade sesame tartar sauce was also excellent on shrimp and squid.
Every food is sooooooooooo crispy n tasty!
Salad in soy sauce dressing was very fresh and tasty too. I just love to go again this place right now!!"}
{"text":"Winning winter comfort food.

Everything was simple and scrumptious: an original set with perfectly fried cutlets (with cheese is delicious) and shredded cabbage with sesame dressing. Karaage curry with rice - yummmmmm. Wash it down with some sapporo or asahi and you are good to go. 

Orders are big and we easily shared 2 mains between 3 people."}
{"text":"My wife and I are visiting Toronto from Los Angeles, CA.  We stopped by Mr. Tonkatsu for lunch. As soon as you walk in you are greeted by their host with a warm smile who directs you to your table. The decor in the restaurant is fantastic. Very modern like and unique style furniture. 

We ordered what our waiter recommended. I had the curry pork tonkatsu and my wife the cheese tonkatsu. We also ordered the honey butter chicken and the fried chicken wings. Now in Los Angeles there are tons of eateries and restaurants, especially tonkatsu. All the meals were superb! The tonkatsu was meaty and the curry very delicious! The cheese tonkatsu was also amazing! The honey butter chicken was seriously the highlight though. The powder sauce and the special breading on the chickens strips made the perfect combo. I highly recommend it!

Definitely a place my wife and I would visit again!"}
{"text":"best chicken katsu i've tried so far. the waitress assisted me on how to properly eat it since there seemed to be many different components to the dish. the chicken was soooo crispy and the cabbage salad was refreshing. the dish also came with soba noodles (cold i believe) which were delightful. would 100% recommend to anyone craving fried chicken."}
{"text":"Love this place! I would say the tonkatsu here is comparable to the tonkatsu you get in Japan. Definitely try their tenderloin tontaksu. I also love their katsudon and their karaage don isn't bad either. Service is decent."}
{"text":"Heard about this place and came and give it a try. Ordered a curry pork tenderloin katsu for lunch. Is around $20 with tax and tips. 
Pork tenderloin was ok and the curry sauce is flavourful. Have to dip the pork with the curry sauce if not it won't taste as good without the sauce. 
Is too pricy if is a $20 lunch and is not filing. 
I would say you won't miss anything even if you don't try this place cause lots of other selection around there with a better price."}
{"text":"Very tasty and generous portions, on both the original tonkatsu sets and cheapest donburi on the menu. I will be back."}
{"text":"Fried food galore.

I am a big fan of all oils and fried foods. Mr. Tonkatsu does it very well! I ordered the pork cutlet. The pretty standard and staple dish of the place. The pork was moist as well as not too oily. The way they fried it was through a healthier way with bread batter and less of the oily and aftertaste feeling which I am not a fan of. The place is small but comfy. It comes with a small soba noodle to start and the sesame grinder for fun. it sesame is to be used later for your main dish. Overall a pretty good experience!"}
{"text":"A great Korean bbq spot. They have sushi as well and although it's not bad I would not recommend ordering sushi. 

We have been there a number of times and ordered the ribs, bulgogi, and beef bimbop and they were all consistently fantastic. 

The service was good, overall this was the Korean Bbq we have been to in Toronto."}
{"text":"In addition to the tonkatsu, the meal comes with unlimited miso soup, cabbage, and rice. Asking for a refill was straightforward. Once you finish any sidedish (doesn't need to be all), you prompt the waitress for a refill and he/she will either refill your bowl/plate or bring you a new one.

Needless to say, the tonkatsu was the star of the show. The panko crust was very light and crispy. My friend suggested that the pork would do well without the cheese. I found the cheese to add a very welcomed saltiness to the tonkatsu. The cheese wasn't of the cheap processed type. It was really thick and stretchy. 

For the cabbage, each table has a bottle filled with a japanese-styled sesame vinaigrette for you to drizzle on top. Both my friend and I really enjoyed the vinaigrette. It was very flavourful and made the tasteless raw cabbage quite appetizing. I even went for seconds.

Now onto the tonkatsu sauce, it's pretty sweet and gains a nutty flavour when you add the crushed sesame seeds. But I found it to be as strong as something like barbeque sauce. Both my friend and I used it sparingly to avoid it overpowering the tonkatsu. Actually, I primarily used it to help me finish my ball of rice. 

It's a nice addition to have a restaurant devoted to the art of tonkatsu. But with the competitive restaurant surroundings, it's hard to say when I'd go back. The place is quite small which causes seating problems in terms of availability and spacing. But it'd definitely be my go to place if I'm craving for good quality tonkatsu."}
{"text":"Rice was totally undercooked.
I ordered pork tenderloin which was not tender at all.
I never throw away any food, but I could not finish my meal and threw left overs into trash."}
{"text":"We went to this small but busy place two weeks ago with friends. They served Japanese style breaded deep-fried pork/chicken cutlet, which were very fresh, tender and crispy. The kitchen is located right in the centre of the restaurant so the cooking is done there in your view. One of the best cutlets I've ever had!!! Casual atmosphere, reasonably priced with great service! I would definitely go there again! Must try the chicken cutlet! 

J&D"}
{"text":"We were there with friends, and were impressed with the quality of the food. One of the best cutlets I've had! It was fresh, tender and crispy. The kitchen is in the middle of the restaurant so you can see the cooking done right there! It's a busy place, and you must try the chicken cutlet, my favourite!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times and all three visits were remarkable! 

I've had the karaage don, chicken karaage, chicken katsu curry and chicken with cheese katsu. Everything is DELICIOUS. I highly suggest their chicken with cheese katsu with curry sauce, it's not on the menu but you can definitely ask for it!

The portions are massive! And the rice, miso soup, salad and sauces are refillable *whatttt*

Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"I've had the pork loin, chicken cheese katsus and they were all really delicious. If you come to mr tonkatsu, it will make it hard for you to eat katsu anywhere else because they really make it a great experience. The katsu is not oily at all, super crispy, and actually quite light - you'd get much fuller on ramen. I'd recommend trying the cheese katsus, and the salad dressing is a must on the cabbage slaw. The rice is also very moist and soft, which complements everything else very well. 

Service is always really great - everyone is nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Great place for dinner- I recommend coming a little earlier as the place is quite small and seats fill up quickly. The staff here are attentive and friendly, and the tonkatsu is amazing, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Could be just my love for pork but the portion could have been a little bigger, or a thicker cut. However, with unlimited refills on salad, rice, and miso soup I can hardly complain. Will definitely be returning when I am in the area."}
{"text":"I took the Pork Tenderloin And was really tasty, the service was also rapid and the atmosphere was great. As per my Japanese friend, the meal flavor was truly authentic too.  The portion was satisfying."}
{"text":"I came here for a quick lunch today. And because they added more new items to their menu, I wanted to try them out. So I ordered their pork loin katsu curry. I love Japanese curry so I was really excited for that. When the food came, I noticed it was sucha HUGE portion - I couldn't finish it and ended up taking the rest to go. Firstly, the pork loin itself was cut into thick slices and it was crispy but the bottom was a bit soggy because there was curry at the bottom. The curry was okay, but I think I had better curry. 

Anyway, now that there's more items to choose from you have more options so I'll definitely be back again. What's funny is that the three times I've been here, I sat in the same spot lol."}
{"text":"This place is soooooo good and reminds me of Japan! It did take a bit long to get our orders but once it came, everything was great! I got the pork tenderloin pork katsu while my bf got pork katsu curry. Mine was so tender and crispy without being too oily, and I also am obsessed with the salad dressing! Can't get enough of it.

My boyfriends curry katsu with cheese was also amazing, the cheese adds an extra creaminess that was perfect! I don't feel guilty after eating this even if it's fried which is a plus!"}
{"text":"This place specializes in their breaded deep friend Japanese styled pork on a bed of rice dressed with mayo and cabbage. This wasn't a good idea for me since I am pescetarian but a friend brought me here and luckily they had a fish Katsu version! 

The fish was very moist, not dry at all which I really appreciated! I'm not a big fried food person so it didn't blow me away but it was very good! The breading was very delicious. The portions are quite large too, I don't often take home a dog baggy but I had to this time or else I felt like I'd explode. The price is absolutely worth it for the portion. We had sapporo ' on the side which were pricey but what do you expect when you have imported beer at a restaurant? ;P

The service was great, the waitresses were very friendly and the decor was on point. Modern with strong Japanese influences making it a very hip place for 20-30 yr olds. The lighting isn't bright either and it feels like a good place to relax and have a delicious filling meal with friends. 

I'm not sure if I'd visit again because I'm not into fried food all that much but if I was ever craving fried fish, for example when I am drunk haha, I would definitely return here!"}
{"text":"Great tonkatsu, reminds me of Japan! 
This is a great place to eat by myself or with a friend.  Great food and not at all expensive.
The service seems to be hit or miss.  But I do enjoy the place"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Authentic menu. I took the pork tenderloin. It was perfect. My friend had the tenderloin curry. Also on point. The service was very good as well. If you miss tonkatsu or would like to try it out this place doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"The rice was looked stale, as if it was in the rice cooker for over 6 hours... then they said it was fresh. Hell, I saw that yellow rust, so either they lied or they didn't clean the bowl. 

The tonkatsu is extremely overpriced, not worth $15. 
Miso is horrible. Tasteless and made with dried seaweed. No tofu.
The salad is a joke. (Shredded cabbage?!)
Overall, this is overpriced and horrible. If it was an $8 meal, the BS could have passed. The actual price of the meat is around $2 since its sliced so thin (for cooking purposes) and we all know cabbage, rice and powdered miso soup is not worth much, even if it does come with free refills. Don't suggest eating here. 

I could choose 0 stars, I would."}
{"text":"My experience here can be summed up in one sentence. \"They ran out of rice\". How is that even possible? We basically waited for 40 minutes for our food because they had to cook the rice. Some people literally left cause they wait for too long. The food was honestly not bad and it's not too pricey but how do you run out of rice during a Sunday afternoon? Running out of rice at a Japanese restaurant is like running of out dough at a pizza place. I will go back but just please have rice ready, I don't want to wait another 40 mins. Thanks love u."}
{"text":"My family loves this place.  Katsu they serve are always perfectly cooked.   It comes with all you can eat steamed rice and cabbage salad.  Also comes with all you can drink miso soup.  Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Mr. Tonkatsu is my Disneyland for great fried chicken. Though their katsu sets are amazing (I love the chicken cheese one even though I'm lactose intolerant), it's their Honey Butter chicken that sets them apart from countless fried chicken restaurants in the city. It's not greasy, not overbearing with breading, pretty meaty, real juicy, and unbelievably tasty. God bless Mr. and Mrs. Tonkatsu."}
{"text":"It was my first time here but I love meat and fried stuff so I expected to like this place. I love that they came with unlimited salad and unlimited rice AND unlimited miso soup. Their presentation was cute. The tonkatsu was on a little steel tray on top of the big tray. Service was fast and the staff were courteous.

What stopped me from giving it a 5 was the rice.

I don't consider myself a huge rice snob but I do have expectations. It should be soft, warm with a ribbon of steam coming from it, and it should have that rice aroma.

The only criterion this rice got was the ribbon of steam.

Never have I ever bitten into such hard rice. I had much better rice from a Chinese food court meal that's been sitting out for a day. The waitress offered to exchange after we complained but to no avail. That rice still tore through my intestines.

Overall, cute little place and it's neat. It's kryptonite was the rice."}
{"text":"Went today with my family for the first time.  Waited for an excessive amount of our time to get our food.  My son and I ordered the Butternut fried chicken.  The chicken arrived overly fried and covered in white powdered butter.  After the first bite, we felt nauseous, due to the excessive garlic and the taste of \"excessively buttered popcorn\".  We told the waitress our concerns and that we wanted to cancel our order.  She called the owner.  The owner arrived telling us we had to pay for the food because we ordered it, and that this was the most popular dish on their menu.  I told her we would pay for the drinks, however, since we barely touched our food it wouldn't be fair to pay for dishes that were prepared so poorly.  After a lengthy discussion and argument, she agreed that we didn't have to pay for our food.  What horrible service!  Having been to numerous Japanese restaurants throughout Toronto, this was by far the worst I have ever come across.  I should also point out that they don't have sushi, sashimi or rolls - the standard items one would see in a Japanese restaurant.  Huge disappointment!!!"}
{"text":"Food is okay if you want a quick lunch or dinner. Nothing special nothing bad just okay."}
{"text":"Oh, you hit the spot. If you're craving for authentic Katsu, this doesn't disappoint.

We always order the pork loin Katsu, the cheesy prod loin Katsu, and the karaage chicken wings. Their Katsu sets are unlimited rice and salad. But you don't need to worry about their portion sizes. The serving sizes are very much worth your dollar(s). 

The Katsu is always perfectly golden fried and tender on the inside. The toasted sesame dressing is the perfect condiment to your fried piece of goodness. The crisp and freshness of the salad with the tangy and salty dressing cleanses your palate getting it ready for another perfect bite. Pay a visit and you won't regret it. Never fails to satisfy your hungry belly. 

One suggestion though - please add desserts to your menu. You never know how much this can boost your sales."}
{"text":"this is the place!!! i can not describe a better place to go for some great Katsu! the service is amazing! the food is amazing! the whole atmosphere is amazing! this is the place i just keep coming back too and i don't plan on stopping!"}
{"text":"To be honest, I wasn't a big fan of Mr. Tonkatsu: the food tasted great but I think what bothered me was the concept of the whole set. 

I ordered a pork tenderloin katsu which came with rice, miso soup, tonkatsu sauce and a cabbage slaw. The pork tenderloin was amazing, extremely tender and a very generous portion, I would definitely recommend paying the few dollars extra and get this over the normal pork katsu. 

The slaw was quite disappointing, being very dry despite the dressing provided. The miso soup tasted very generic, nothing different than the store bought ones. 

Half way through the meal, I wasn't able to eat anymore due to the heavy nature of the set, I was eating fried meat over carbs (rice) with a BBQ like sauce. My body was desperately calling for vegetables but the slaw was just so dry that it did not help with the situation. 

Overall, good for their katsu, the rest that comes with it is not great."}
{"text":"First time here- Dinner for three on a Sunday night. The place was busy but not packed which makes it a great place to grab dinner without RSVP. I ordered the Tsuyu Katsu set. Pork loin katsu on a bed of salad & homemade sauce (broth but not like a bowl of soup). It was waaay better than i expected. I will defiantly be coming back."}
{"text":"Either come wit a fat ass or pillow, you will be required to sit on homemade (2X 4's) furniture! Sort of furnished like an upscale interment camp. I promise, I had nothing to do with the Japanese internment in the war, why are you punishing me. I understand tonkatsu. is a traditional Japanese meal, sort of like deep fried pork chops, or deep fried chicken or probably deep fried something else. Entertainment consists of grinding sesame seeds in a bowl. God knows why, maybe to add to the internment ambiance, no song sheet provided for the customers to sing along with the labor. Unlimited masses of shredded cabbage make it ideal for anyone who likes a bargain. Great place for late night drinker who left their dining standards at home."}
{"text":"Best Tonkatsu I had so far in T.O besides Omotesand? where my Japanese fried recommend me a few years back.  The tenderness of the pork and refreshing cabbage took me back.  The meal came with rice and miso so was pretty filling.  The Tonkatsu sauce was so good I had to get more.  The service was great would definitely try again"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! My roommate and I were craving Japanese food and decided to try this place. The chicken katsu was perfection. Free refills on the rice and soup which were a nice surprise. Service was great too!"}
{"text":"A cute little place located in Korea town, and they specialize in tonkatsu. They also have other proteins such as chicken, beef and fish as well as soba, appetizers and drinks. What I first noticed when I came here is that the place didn't smell like oil at all! I was pleasantly surprised. You get unlimited rice, salad, and miso soup if you order any kind of katsu meal. I would have to say that it is a good deal for big eaters, but not for everyone. With that in mind, I found the menu to be a bit pricey for what you get. If the meals were $2 cheaper, it will make sense. If you can refill rice, salad, and miso soup then sure it is worth the money, but you are basically paying for unlimited option even if you don't intend to get more of complimentary sides. My boyfriend ordered cheese tonkatsu and I got a chicken katsu. There was a lot of cheese oozing out from the tonkatsu. The chicken katsu was a bit too thin in my opinion. The exterior of both katsu was light, crispy and not oily at all. The meat was juicy and tender. Their katsu sauce tasted like ketchup though. 

Overall, yes I would recommend this place to anyone who crave for katsu. A clean place with good food and good service."}
{"text":"BEST KATSUDON IN THE CITY, but I can also recommend the tonkatsu and honey chicken. This is a neighbourhood favourite. Better service and food quality than their other location (Yonge)."}
{"text":"Went there today for the first time! I say, am full from the food and impressed with the crispy pork set I got. I just feel like if your the type of person who eats a lot of meat over rice ratio then you might want to order an extra meat on the side, which we did. 

The good news is that the rice, cabbage, and miso were refillable of course which is always a good idea... just not too fond of their cabbage though, its sliced way too thin. 

I would recommend this place for sure to anyone whose into tonkatsu. The staff is very friendly and attentive so it was a nice experience overall."}
{"text":"Solid katsu, very consistent, but a bit pricey.

The great part is that the miso soup and rice are refillable and the portion sizes are quite good. Their service is fast, so it is good for an outing with friends. 

The AC is really strong and for those of you who prefer warmer temperatures, bring a sweater or something to stave off the cold.

Price: 3/5 (but since it is refillable, 4/5)
Food: 4.5/5
Service: 4/5"}
{"text":"I went here with my friends and ordered the chicken an cheese cutlets and it was soo good! Perfect comfort food for when you want some good fried chicken. One thing I noticed though is that when you order any cutlet with cheese they give you a noticeably smaller portion than if you order a plain cutlet. If you don't mind, go for the cheese but honestly I don't recommend getting cheese. It didn't really taste that much better and I was finished way before my friends were done and I was still a bit hungry after. Also their debit card machine rejected my card several times so bring some cash just in case. I recommend this place if you're craving some good cutlets :)"}
{"text":"The name of this restaurant makes it fairly clear as to what they specialize in: tonkatsu. Don't come here if you want a light meal - Mr. Tonkatsu specializes in all that is breaded and deep fried.

I've had both versions of the pork katsu and tried a piece of the one with cheese inside. All were delicious - the batter is crunchy, but not greasy, and the meat itself manages to stay tender. All of the sets come with refillable miso soup, rice and cabbage. The cabbage itself is dry but there is a labelled salad dressing on all of the tables (the labeling is a relatively new addition - I guess people didn't realize it was the dressing) that is strangely addictive. They also have no hesitation in refilling any of your requested items promptly and efficiently!

One fun pre-dinner activity is the bowl of sesame seeds they give you to grind up so that you can add freshly ground sesame seeds to your sauce. There's something strangely satisfying about grounding these seeds with the little wooden stick they give you - it's basically a grooved version of a mortar and pestle. I always save some of the ground up sesame seeds in case I need a top-up of the dipping sauce.

The staff is amazing. They seem genuinely happy to be working there which can be rare for a restaurant in this city. It feels as though the entire team behind the restaurant is determined to create a positive guest experience. They've started to recognize me as a repeat visitor and pointed out the new additions to the menu in case I want to branch out a bit.

This restaurant is also very approachable - I have a friend who is fairly new to the city and is a picky eater who is reluctant to try \"ethnic\" food. Mr. Tonkatsu was an excellent introduction to the world of eating with chopsticks.

As of my last visit a few weeks ago, the draft beer had yet to be installed but they do have bottles of beer available."}
{"text":"Small place, but big in flavour. 

Four of us ordered 

1. pork katsu
2. tenderloin katsu(my favourite for now)
3. beef katsu and
4. pork katsu with soba. 

Hand-breaded cutlets were outstanding! Crispy out, tender and juicy in. They bake their own bread and make panko out of it. I was very curious and so i had to see the texture of the panko. It was like cotton candy! Too bad i didn't get to touch them... Dipping sauce with sesame seeds enhanced the rich flavour of my katsu. Tenderloin katsu is just a buck more then a regular pork katsu, but the quality and the portion is way more then just a buck. Soba wasn't a biggy. It was just a regular soba.. Felt it didn't go along with katsu. But oh well, it's a hot summer! So what. Almost forgot to mention about crispy chicken thigh appetizer! Little chewy, but very good. Perfect seasoning. Ordered them sauce on the side.

The staffs were friendly and attentive which made the food tasted much better. Now i need to try their curry and cheese chicken katsu. It was very nice to refill our salad and rice at no cost."}
{"text":"I made my visit just a few weeks after the place had opened! 

I loved the interior of the restaurant and the place was very quiet when I went, which also made my experience much better. 
The whole process of grinding up your own sesame seed and sauce adds an excitement while waiting for the meal! I ordered the cheese tonkatsu and it was probably one of the best tonkatsus I have had!! The tonkatsu was FILLED with cheese and it was not too overwhelming. However, I thought the katsu was quite smaller than I expected when I visited, but I heard they made it a little bigger now so I definitely want to make another visit again soon!!"}
{"text":"Perhaps this is blasphemous, but I come here for the fried chicken!  My faves are the spicy saucy wings, and I recently tried and surprisingly loved the sprinkled friend chicken, with honey butter flavour!

That being said, the tonkatsu is also amazing, even better than some I've had in Japan.  Meat is tender and coating is crispy and light, not greasy at all!  The side salad is great with their house dressing.

Don't leave without trying the soba noodles!  The broth is so flavourful, it's one of the best things on the menu. Yum!"}
{"text":"After trying to figure out a good day to check it out, I finally was able to dine here on Sunday evening. Given the unfavorable weather that occurred in the city as well as some hiccups regarding the west bound streetcar service :-S, (like a 25 minute wait at Queen and University while watching the rain come and go at intervals) Mr. Tonkatsu was really worth the effort of traversing to this part of town from where I live.

Going straight to the meals, I chose the Crispy Chicken Thigh appetizer and the Pork Tenderloin Katsu set. The food for our party of 10 (divided between two tables) were brought out almost at the same time, awesome timing! One of my tablemates had a bowl of the soba noodles and he gave the rest of a try. It had a certain taste to it probably getting some of the flavor from the cold broth in which it was served. My crispy chicken app was heaven, even the fried coating had this look like clouds, and the meat was tender and flavorful. For one person the portion of the appetizer is definitely not measly looking and combining it with the tonkatsu meal, there was more fried meat to enjoy :-) 
Everyone at our table and I'm sure at the other table were awed by our tokatsu meats, definitely had the spotlights on them for awhile. The look of the fried panko coating was just right and had that distinct crispy texture found on other tonkatsu cutlets. Even the tonkatsu sauce served on the side here looks different, it's a bit thicker in consistency and also the color was lighter and more reddish than other sauces that are usually drizzled on the fried cutlets. The entire meal was really enjoyable.

I might have wrote in a different review that I usually turn to Japanese food for comfort during troubled times, and Mr. Tonkatsu definitely helped me overcome the annoyances that had occurred on a rainy day :-D 
I'll definitely be back for more fried appetizers and tonkatsu :-D"}
{"text":"First time here -- I've heard lots of good things about their other location.  Stopped by here for a meal and ordered their katsu curry (pork tenderloin).  It was just fantastic.  The portion was bigger than I thought and the tonkatsu was just breaded perfectly.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Personally not a fan of dry and room temperature tonkatsu. I ordered the pork katsu which came with a side of cabbage and miso soup. Their cabbage dressing and tonkatsu sauce is more on the acidic side. Good prices though!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on Friday and it was not too busy, it's probably more of a dinner place anyway due to price.

I tried the chicken katsu with cheese and soba noodles on the side.

The soba noodles were so fresh tasting and flavourful. It was super delicious.

The chicken katsu with cheese was amazing. The meet was moist and the cheese was so good. I'm not sure I would get it without cheese inside because the cheese really adds alot to the flavour.

Overall its a great lunch and great service but -1 for the price. For dinner I would give it 5/5 but my lunch came out to $23 which is heavy for a lunch but the quality is really good."}
{"text":"The staff here is quite friendly, and the service is fairly quick. The ebi bowl was served with miso soup. The deep-fried shrimp was coated evenly, although a bit too oily for my liking. The sauce that they served with the rice, however, was quite tasty. Although I enjoyed my meal, it wasn't anything too memorable and likely won't be back."}
{"text":"i ate park loin cheese curry and honey butter chicken.
curry is flavorful and panko is so crunch!!
and i recommend every chicken!!"}
{"text":"I find the katsu tastes very greasy, by the time I finished 2/3 of it I couldn't continue to eat no more because of the oily taste. 

I did like the salad that they put on the side. It goes very well with the protein, also yummy with the sesame dressing that they have on the table. 

In general, the combo is quite nice if you like deep fried food. However, it isn't my cup of tea."}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots in the city. Amazing service, very friendly and efficient staff. Food is to die for, always fresh and served promptly. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Excellent and tasty, something different to try in Koreatown. Friendly, and attentive staff. Clean and pleasant atmosphere. We will DEFINITELY go back :)"}
{"text":"I went there first wanting to use their WiFi and turned out they don't have WiFi. But the food is so good I don't need it lol.
The Katsu is the best I have ever had so far. The Pablo is crispy and the meat is tender. The rice has the right amount of consistency. The cabbage is fresh and sweet. I also like how they serve lemon water to compensate the richness of the pork. 
They did all I can ask for katsu, brilliant."}
{"text":"The Chicken Katsu did not taste like any other katsu from other restaurants! The portion was just perfect; not too little and not too much. Before receiving the food, they give you a bowl of sesame seeds which you have to grind up and put in the sauce once your katsu arrives. You are given a bowl of miso soup on the side of your katsu. 

The Chicken Katsu tasted a bit strange, sorta like the BBQ pork you can get in chinatown. The restaurant had no wifi, which is a bit of a downside to many people. Most of the items on the menu were a bit expensive. Overall, it was a very decent experience, but I would most likely not come back in the future."}
{"text":"I tried the cheese + pork katsu with soba.

* soba was 5/5. I loved it. Served with some takuan, a nice pairing.
* miso soup was 2/5 at best. I guess cause they provide infinite refills on it, they do not want to make it well.
* katsu itself is nothing special. 3/5?
* I hated the sauce. This is they house special sauce.
* For veggies they just give you some raw shredded cabbage. Horrible. You won't like it unless you are a bunny.

I would only come back for the soba."}
{"text":"They imitates authentic tonkatsu well however I would not come back again because the food quality was not good and the pork meat was not tender enough. I can only remember greasy fried meats."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, quick service, extraordinary food. Probably the best pork katsu in town - after all its quality is very similar to the best ones that I had in Tokyo!"}
{"text":"Finally a Japanese style tonkatsu restaurant opened in Toronto. The tonkatsu is very crispy, one of the best(other than Tokyo kitchen). Also you can refill the rice, soup and cabbage, quite authentic.

Will give it 5 stars if the cabbage was sliced super super fine, like all the tonkatsu restaurants in Japan."}
{"text":"This place is the best. Authentic Japanese katsu (try the pork tenderloin)! Today I had the fried chicken (thighs). A huge plate piled high with delectable pieces of fried (but never greasy) chicken. Forget the fast food chains.This place is da bomb! The service is always excellent and the food is always amazing!"}
{"text":"A long line at El Furniture prompted us to visit Mr.Tonkatsu for a unique and charming dining experience. It was later in the evening, so there were only a couple other patrons dining. My friend got the chicken wings and I got the tonkatsu sirloin set.

The wings were super tasty and crispy and came with an interesting dipping sauce which tasted faintly of cinnamon. I really enjoyed it.

Prior to my tonkatsu set arriving, our server brought a bowl with a ridged interior filled with toasted sesame seeds and a wooden pestle. The idea is to grind these up into a powder beforehand and mix them into your dipping sauce when the meal arrives. I did so with gusto, and the aroma coming off of the sesame really excited me for my meal.

The tonkatsu itself was okay, a little too tough and chewy for my liking, so I think I might like the tenderloin next time (they were sold out when I went) or the chicken. The sauce came alive with the addition of the ground sesame seeds and was very enjoyable. It was served with a bowl of sticky rice, miso soup and a small salad of shredded cabbage. According to the menu, you can get free refills of the rice, soup and salad. There are also bottles of dressing at each table for your cabbage.

I think I will come back in the future to try other options as this place is pretty charming with friendly and attentive staff, but I can't see myself coming here a lot because of the limited variety of their menu. Worth checking out if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"During my brother's recent trip to Japan, he sent me a picture of a katsu with curry meal he had and it looked absolutely incredible. So when I found out I could get a similar dish right here in the city, I didn't waste too much time getting my butt over to Mr. Tonkatsu.

Though the menu's got a lot of tasty looking options, I obviously zeroed in on the Pork Loin Katsu Curry (\"homemade curry, pickled daikon\").

It arrived a short time later and it's good. Actually, it's really good. The homemade curry is rich and flavorful, and the breading on the katsu is just about perfect. (The accompanying rice and salad are quite good, too.) My only real complaint is the meat itself, as it was a little on the dry and tough side.

Still, I'll definitely be returning to sample some of Mr. Tonkatsu's other wares."}
{"text":"Tried this concept in Hong Kong and was dieing to get a taste of it back home.  To be fair my expectations coming in was high, but it didnt live up to Hong Kong.  Sesame was not roasted, portions were small for price, and sauce was a bit sour.  BUT, tonkatsu was on point, beautifully fried and rice was cooked, well.  Would recommend you come and try."}
{"text":"I think I finally found my goto Katsu spot in Toronto. Although, I have been hunting for a few spots that is close to Wako (Los Angeles, CA), this is as close as it'll get!! I ordered the Pork Cutlet with Cheese x Curry. It was delicious!! Super savoury and I am definitely coming back to try to Karaage chicken."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for deep fried pork cutlet. It's one of the few places in Toronto that actually has the little pots that let's you grind the sesame seed for the Tonkatsu sauce. It's a quite a fun little activity that keeps you busy while you wait for your food.


I ordered the tenderloin tonkatsu and it was a bit too soft, I personally prefer a tonkatsu with a chew so I'd recommend the Pork Loin Katsu over the Pork Tenderloin Katsu (plus the loin is a dollar cheaper).

The set is a lot of food and will definitely make you full, and the awesome thing about Mr. Tonkatsu is that the cabbage, miso soup and rice are all free for refill!"}
{"text":"Can i give more than 5*? Please?

I literally came here by chance after my friend and i were walking down bloor for like 15 minutes being undecided on what to get for dinner and came across this place cause we were just starving for literally any food. Turned out to be a 5/5 choice.

Got the tonkatsu set and the pork was so tender and fried to crispy perfection, but not drying out the pork. The portion is pretty big considering you get a miso soup and cabbage salad as well with the order.

Also got the chicken karaage and holy heavens it is heaven in fried chicken form, with a perfect balance of texture, seasoning, and tenderness. I direly urge you ALL to try it (make sure you ask for their hot sauce to pair with the chicken perfectly!)

Service was fantastic. Fast and friendly. There is literally nothing wrong except their debit machine qasnr working that night."}
{"text":"It has been several years that I haven't ate at this place. Normally I go to Katsuya since its closer for me, ( I don't really know the difference between the two tho..) Since this day I was already dt that day after a Raptors game and wanted to eat some Katsu.

I got the pork loin katsu and man... it was so delicious. Everything about the pork katsu was fantastic and super tasty. The katsu had good amount of breading and once it was fried it came out very crunchy and juicy. The cuts of the pork were very generous as well, there is about 10 pieces to be eaten with the rice. 

This place never gets old, food is great and service is awesome. I would come back to this place without any hesitation."}
{"text":"I think the options here are great if you eat meat, but if you have anyone in your party who doesn't, the options for them are limited.

The food itself was ok, though somewhat heavy (naturally because it's fried). The portion is large, but it included only a small amount of carb. If the ratio of meat to carb was different, maybe it will feel different. Rice is cheap...just add a little bit more!

We sat right next to the kitchen. It was a cold day, so it was nice that it was warm, but I can imagine if it's not cold, we probably would've asked to get moved.

Overall, it's nice to see the area getting more restaurants like this. It adds variety to the other things already in the area."}
{"text":"I stumbled by this place by mistake, and had my doubts about it, but soon enough, I actually try this place, and it's amazing. Here is what I ordered

Green Tea - Just normal green tea, that was pretty enjoyable.
Karaange Wings - Japanese fried chicken. My friend ordered this, and she let me try some, and it was DELICIOUS. Perfectly fried, and bursting with tons of flavor. Available as a appetizer and main dish.
Pork Loin Tonkatsu - I honestly wished I had ordered two. The pork was delicious, and perfectly fried. The miso soup and rice were very good, and I was so glad you can get free refills for the two. The cabbage was OK, but I don't really like cabbage anyway.
Pork Loin Katsu Curry - My other friend got this, and I didn't have any, but it looked good. Simple Tonkatsu in a curry sauce on top of rice.

So, Basically, I think the best bet here is the Tonkatsu plate.

I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here with medium expectations because it doesn't look like much from the outside, but I was very pleasantly surprised. Service is very polite and fast, and all the food is super fresh. My friend and I both ordered the cheapest pork katsu meals, and had loads to spare. The katsu was crispy and not over battered, the rice was fresh and everything was piping hot! It also came with shredded cabbage and a soup, which helped provide variety of flavour and texture. 

They bring you sesame seeds to grind and add to the dipping sauce which gives the whole thing a more authentic feel, and is fun to do! I would definitely recommend this place for cheap, good eats (with huge portions)."}
{"text":"Mmm what is not to love about Japanese fried food?  This is one the best places that I've been to for tonkatsu - we had the curry chicken and pork w/ cheese tonkatsu's.  Both were quite delicious but I have to say that the cheese option was definitely the winner. 

The curry chicken was great but it wasn't something unique - I've had good katsu curry elsewhere too and while this was still delicious, it wasn't special.  The cheese tonkatsu on the other hand was just absolutely delicious.  The cheese was stringy and delicious and the fried layer was so light, fluffy, and delicious.  You also had a ground sesame (grind yourself) to put into the sauce too, which made it all the more delicious. 

The meals come with a salad and soup and are a very good portion.  Service is absolutely fantastic - the waitress kept checking in to see if we needed anything more and even gave us more sesame to grind.   

Overall, I would definitely come back here for lunch."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service

Mr. Tonkatsu is located in the Annex, right across from Guu SakaBar. If you want Japanese food that's not sushi, ramen, udon, or anything that's hot soup-related, this is your place.

The decorations here are typical Japanese style, especially how the walls and chairs were designed. We were greeted immediately and were seated right after, as the place wasn't that busy when we arrived.

The menu has a large focus on, well, tonkatsu, meaning deep fried pork cutlet. My dad decided to try the pork tenderloin katsu, while my mom had the beef katsu set, and I had the honey butter chicken, which was one of their newer items in the menu. We had the crisp squid as an appetizer as well.

Overall, both my mom and dad really enjoyed their katsu sets. The meat was extremely juicy and it was not overly fried, but just crispy enough. My honey butter chicken was also very good, however it has a bit of a spicy punch if you're not spice tolerant like me. Finally, the crisp squid was an okay appetizer, but if I knew beforehand the portions would be as massive as they were, I would've probably skipped the appetizer.

Service was excellent and we were attended to the whole way, including when we needed our waters refilled (some of the food was quite spicy). The food was simple, which matched the simple service we got (instead of the overly dramatic experience you get in the Guu establishments).

If you like tonkatsu, I definitely recommend this place. They also have a branch that recently opened in North York if you don't wanna travel to downtown!"}
{"text":"Best tonkatsu I ever had. I definitely will come back again. Good food and good service !"}
{"text":"We came here for group of seven and the food was great! I also thought that the servers did their best to try to serve everybody with the limited amount of space that they had. The food was advertising and the chicken cutlets were be cooked perfectly. The space was a little crowded and small and the prices were fair. For $20 you'd be able to get in wonderful meal and you will be full and your belly will be happy."}
{"text":"The spicy wings are saucy and delicious, and the chicken katsu was nice and moist. Portions are big which is good since prices are somewhat high. Staff is super friendly. Great experience!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite tonkatsu place in Toronto! I have been coming to this location and Bloor's for awhile now, at least coming in once or twice a month. 

My friend ordered the chicken & cheese katsu, while I ordered the shrimp curry. Our orders came slightly steaming, which is just how I like it and the cheese had a slight ooze from my friend's plate. The chicken was tender and cheese, then it had a delicious crispy coating which kept the pieces together. My shrimp was also crispy and the curry was tasty. I like that you can have unlimited supply of cabbage salad (crunchy and fresh), miso soup (just right, not salty) and rice (which I didn't need).

The portions here are plenty and excellent value for money. 

The place was clean and the staff were helpful and repeatedly checked if we needed more of the salad, etc."}
{"text":"Mr Tonkatsu 
 
These guys have two locations. One on Bloor and the other Yonge st. This is our go to place when we don't know what to have. They had long line ups when they first opened, but now it's a steady flow. 
 
Location: Near the corner of Bathurst and Bloor. Just a stone throw away from the Bathurst subway station. Only a few on street parking spots. That's all because they turned Bloor st into a bike friendly street. There is a green P parking near by. During the week, I believe it's $8 from 6 PM to 7AM. 4/5 stars
 
Atmosphere: Small place. Not much seating, be prepared to sit with people you don't know. They play very loud music, therefore hard to have a conversation. The decor look very rustic. Seats are hard, non cushion seats. That's probably how they make people leave. 4/5 stars
 
Service: For such a small place, they service was poor. Called the server to place our order, but she said hold on a second because she wanted to place the order of the table that was seated 2 seconds before us. Well if they were ready, they would have called her. Took a few reminders about getting us water. The appetizer came 10 mins after we got our entrees. 2/5 stars
 
Food: Fair warning to all, they mainly served deep fried food. I had pork loin with cheese. It comes with rice, miso soup, and cabbage. This is also refillable, so if you're like me and enjoys rice, bring it! The katsu sauce is tasty, but when you add crushed the sesame seeds given to you, it brings the sauce to another level. The chicken tights are also yummy. I also enjoy the pork loin with cheese in curry. This is Japanese curry, so it's not spicy. The breading is made in house, and is what makes or breaks a good katsu. 5/5 stars
 
Price: When we this place first opened, the food was reasonably priced. But it seams like they recently raised their prices. The combos is plenty for a single person. The cost for 2 combos with 1 appetizer and 2 drinks costs us about $45 4/5 stars
 
Overall: Since they have been open, the recipes have not changed. The consistency still the same. Great food, but if their prices go any higher, it won't be worth the price. 4/5 stars

{"text":"Perhaps some Katsu? YES!! I've been seeing pictures of this place for a while now and finally got to try it out. The restaurant is quite small but being a late visit, it wasn't too busy. I got to try the crispy chicken thigh to start and for mains - curry pork katsu with rice and chicken katsu with soba. The crispy chicken thigh was true to its name and honestly, all I could think of was how similar it tasted to Popeye's. For the two katsus, I am not sure which meat I liked better but overall, both meats were tender and fried to a golden crisp. Generally, I like Japanese curries and was not disappointed. I was also surprised that the soba noodles were in soup and not chilled like what I would normally expect. Overall, portions were generous, service was good and food came out at a reasonable pace. This will be my go-to for any katsu cravings and can't wait to be back to try the Cheese Katsu!"}
{"text":"It was a first time visit. Went around dinner time.6 pm on a Wednesday night. The place was not very full about 4 other tables a d us. Not very noisy but they doplay music. The staff were very nice and answered our questions as best as they could. For those with but allergies they do not cool with nuts. They do use sesame though. Our food came in good time. We ordered the saucy chicken with sweet sauce a bowl of rice and some soup. Just a pre dinner dinner. The serving was so much more than. I expected. I thought the portion would be smaller. The price is worth is for that much chicken. The sauce was very yummy but I found it over powering after a while( maybe because all we ordered  was the chicken and rice really I found the flavour to be too much after a while). There were no ramen options and a few items had been crossed off the menue. I would return to try their other options. Nothing mind blowing but good if you want to go with a group and share food. Good if you love crispy saucy chicken and staple Japanese sides."}
{"text":"Good food, excellent service and nice place! Lots of choices for katsu. I ordered the chicken katsu with cheese and porkloin katsu with cheese.  It comes with free refill of cabbage salad which by the way is really refreshing and I had 2 bowls with their house salad sauce. Also free refill of rice and miso soup. The server recommended the honey butter crispy chicken which is also very good. Taste a little spicy which is  just right for me. 

I will definitely come back. Curious for the ground beef katsu...."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with friend and fellow Yelper Teresa H. She mentioned that she liked Mr. Tonkatsu so I decided to give it a shot even though all my friends know I'm not a fan of fried chicken or meat in general (crazy I know). 

When we got there, it was still pretty early for dinner so we were seated right away. Teresa mentioned the menu changed a bit and I had a craving for soba noodles so I got a pork tenderloin katsu with soba. Ok, I could have went without the soba because it is quite a lot of food. The soba was plain in soup and some seaweed sprinkled on top but I still enjoyed it. I really enjoyed the dressing and cabbage and miso soup as well. You can ask for unlimited refills for cabbage, miso and rice but seriously I don't know who could eat so much! My katsu itself was okay - expected since I'm not a super huge fan of fried meat but hey, I gave it a chance and thought it was good. I tried a bit of Teresa's porkloin and cheese katsu and it was very nice. 

I also ordered a Japanese tea ($2). It wasn't necessary because they give you lemon and water but it was necessary for me to help digest all the food I ate lol. 

Everything was a bit steep for me - $23 with tax and tip. A bit much for a solo dinner. I did enjoy it but it's probably one of those places I'd go with friends or once or twice a year."}
{"text":"Mmmmm fried chicken...Mr. Tonkatsu does a great job with their fried foods. We got the chicken katsu set that came with shredded cabbage, miso soup, rice, and sauce on the side, the honey butter chicken, side of soba noodles, and crispy shrimp as an appetizer. The fried shrimp was delicious - great crispy battering and the tarter sauce complimented it very well. The chicken katsu was pretty good as well, standard katsu, but I didn't touch the cabbage - I thought it'd be more like a slaw but it was legit just shredded cabbage. I liked that the sauce was on the side so that you could control how much of it you wanted with the katsu. The honey butter chicken was SOOO GOOD! Sweet, salty, and very crunchy. You'll probably feel your arteries clog after a meal here, but in a good way(?). Next time I come I'll probably do without the soba noodles because it was $4 for quite a small bowl of noodles that tasted ok. The service was attentive and friendly. Would recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"If you've a hankering for deep fried food go to Mr. Tonkatsu. I love this little place in the Annex. Service is always friendly and fast, and they focus on Tonkatsu supplemented by a small selection if appetizers. The karaage wings are awesome. The fried dishes are always fresh tasting and crunchy without being greasy. I appreciate restaurants that focus on doing a few things really well - and Mr. Tonkatsu is one of those places. Amazing value for money, and yes, they serve beer. Please open one in King West!"}
{"text":"This is a korean owned restaurant serving japanese food.   

The food is kind of pricy at around $15 before tax.   I ordered the original katsu.   It came in a smaller portion that I expected.   You also get to grind your own sesame seeds.  Again, I don't want to do this but I guess that's just the novelty of it.   It was ok.  I don't have complaints.  but nothing memorable."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. A little pricey yes, but so, so worth it. We were visiting from out of town and came  on an early Friday evening. Not super packed, but some people were waiting for tables by the time we finished. The tonkatsu is fried to perfection - crunchy and light on the outside and juicy on the inside. So. Good. They give you quite a big portion, so you could save it for later if you really wanted, but why would you do that? Highly recommend stopping by here if you have the chance."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very small and no space for your belonging, nor your big winter jacket. The food looks ok, however the pork chop I had was way too soft to a point that you don't feel like eating meat, they must put way too much tenderizer. Service was soso, all the staff was playing around and only provide minimum service. Will I come back? Most likely not"}
{"text":"I  find this price is over-hyped. Ordered the pork cutlet and 2 pieces of meats are very hard which is very disappointing. Soba was so so as well. For $13, I can definitely find a better tonkatsu."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and the experience was still good. The service here is great! The waitresses are attentive and always ask if you need a top up on rice or if you need water. The food is delicious. My cousin and I got chicken katsu with curry and my other cousin got chicken katsu with cheese. It's definitely a heavier dish and I've never been able to finish my meal. I'm also not a big fan of the salad dressing, it's a little salty for me, and as everything else is so heavy I think something sweeter or tangy would have been a nice contrast."}
{"text":"Have had delivery from this location twice now and both times it has been phenomenal. First time I made two orders of the honey butter crispy chicken. Second time I ordered the tonkatsu. What makes it such a phenomenal experience is that it arrives piping hot and still CRISPY! Most friend chicken that gets delivered gets steamed in the bag and ends up being soggy. This was not the case. 

If anyone has had the korean honey butter potato chips, the powder that is added in top tastes just like it! Overall great experience! Looking forward to having it in the store."}
{"text":"I came here on a weekday when the restaurant first opened. The food came out fairly quickly and everything was fresh and tasty. Plus you get to grind your own sesame. Portions are fairly large and filling.

The service was definitely the best part about dining here."}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner on a Saturday and it was pretty busy! I got the Chicken with Cheese Katsu and it was delicious. Even though the portion size was pretty large already, it's pretty awesome that there's unlimited miso soup, salad and rice! I would definitely come back to try the other items on their menu."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hidden treasure. Very solid katsu but the one that stands out by far is the pork with cheese. The mozza cheese makes it that much more flavorful, my friend got it and we ended up getting a second round of it.

Quick tip, miso soup and rice is unlimited so you can order a dinner set and keep getting rounds of rice until your satisfied. Also you can order an additional set of meat whichever you ordered initially for $9."}
{"text":"Crispy,tender and juicy! Best tonkatsu I'v ever eat! The cashier (maybe the boss) super gently and polite?when we leaving? he take a 90degree bow for us. This restaurant deserve thumb up?"}
{"text":"This was my very first time going to Mr.Tonkatsu and I can definitely say it won't be the last time! I've never heard of Mr.Tonkatsu until my friend told me about it and it was incredible!

To start off, the restaurant is quite small, but surprisingly we didn't have to wait to get seated on a Friday night. The waitress was super nice, friendly, and really cute haha! 

My friend and I shared the crispy chicken thigh and they were really good! I would recommend them. I got the chicken cheese katsu and if you're a cheese lover like me, you won't want to miss out on this! As you grab each piece of the chicken katsu, you see the beautiful string of cheese hanging from the chicken katsu. The chicken katsu had a lot of flavour and was fried perfectly! My friend got the chicken katsu curry and I love Japanese curry! It was really good and had a lot of flavour as well. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend you to go here! Really good food, great atmosphere and really cute and friendly waitresses. 

Also! You get unlimited soup, rice and salad when you order one of their entrees! Totally amazing and if you're like me and you like rice in your soup, order an extra bowl of rice and put it in the miso soup! Can't go wrong with that! Haha!"}
{"text":"This is the second time at Mr. Tonkatsu. The first time was at the Yonge and Shepard location. 

Food was very much the same quality as the other location. This time, I went for the chicken with cheese katsu. I don't think I can ever go back to eating katsu without cheese! The chicken was fried to perfection and the cheese was just oozing out. 

Service was a little slow (similar to the Yonge and Shepard location) but again was super friendly. Can't go wrong with the unlimited rice, salad and miso soup!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great interior, great food, great servers. I tried their tender loin Katsu,Demi-Glass Katsu, katsudon, soba, soy chicken and all of them are good! and the price was reasonable for such high quality food. I will definitely go here again and recommend to my friends and families. I've been to Katsuya but I can't compare this place to Katsuya! Much better Katsu, better sauce, there's nothing to compare. Overall, I'd give 6 stars out of 5.


 !         !           !!  !!"}
{"text":"I had the original pork Loin Tonkontsu and it was to die for. The barbecue Tonkontsu sauce was so flavourful and the cabbage with sesame oil dressing was something new and refreshing."}
{"text":"Delicious! Both my friend and I ordered the cheese pork tonkatsu with soba noodles. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good! I love the chicken katsu.  I ordered the set.  The cabbage salad is very simple but tastes good.  Pretty plain so I added the salad dressing to the cabbage.  The rice is plain and since there is no soy sauce I added the salad dressing to the rice as well.  The miso soup is really good.  You can ask for more cabbage, rice or soup if you wish.  I was too full to ask for more but I did find I got hungry again 2 hours after."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I came here with my family on a Wednesday at 5:30pm and it wasn't too crowded.

Service is superb.. the main lady that was serving us was extremely polite and attentive. She filled warm water for our toddler's thermos bottle and came by to ask if we needed any sauces, miso soup and cabbage.

Food is awesome, too. I got the pork katsu with cheese with extra meaf to share and the batter was very crispy and fluffy. Meat was tender and thin - with melted cheese inside it is so delicious!

The sides are great, miso soup and rice were cooked perfectly.

Bathroom is very clean too!

If you are driving, try parking on Albany and walk over."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the service and food. If you order extra meat, it's definitely worth the money. Get a lot more meat than you would expect.
I would certainly be going back to this place again. 
I ordered the pork with cheese katsu which comes with unlimited salad, miso soup and rice refills."}
{"text":"Oh my god this place is amazing. 

It's a tiny shop decorated very nicely. Staff was very friendly when we walked in.

We ordered the pork loin tonkatsu and the pork loin curry and they were so good!! The breading was amazing on both and the curry didn't make the outside soggy or anything. The curry came with cabbage and miso soup. 

The tonkatsu comes with a bowl of sesame seeds that you crush with a mortar and pestle to put into the tonkatsu sauce. It definitely adds a bit of flavor. The sauce goes really well the the tonkatsu. It also comes with miso soup, cabbage, and rice on the side. 

The quality of the food is awesome so it is worth it for the price. Food came out fast and we demolished our plates. 

Come to this place it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Great place, excellent food and exceptional service! What not to love?! Ordered chicken and cheese katsu curry and it was absolutely delicious. A must try if you like Japanese curry! Chicken was very juicy and flavorful. Definitely found a new lunch spot today!"}
{"text":"Definitely decent Tonkatsu for Toronto; I have been waiting a long time for a place like this to arrive here.
I believe the panko &  sauce are made in house,  nicely cooked pork loin; not perfect, but not overly cooked either, fresh cabbage. Miso soup is passable.  Unfortunately, the service needs some work. The dishes take way too long to come out, no explanation or apologies. And when I requested a free refill on rice and cabbage which is advertised everywhere, I waited over 5-10 minutes while the server wasn't doing anything and then had to ask another server to bring them out which she did right away as its basically just scooping the stuff into a bowl, but never apologized for the unnecessary wait. Same thing when I asked for the bill, had to ask to pay after waiting forever."}
{"text":"You have to give this a try if you like pork katsu!! We ordered pork katsu with cheese and the chicken katsu with cheese in curry. We also got an appetizer of the crispy chicken thigh. The katsu wasn't too greasy and the cheese just goes so well with it! It also comes with rice and miso soup on the side. The curry had a mild flavour so not too spicy. The crispy chicken tasted like Popeyes chicken but it was still good. 

The place is kind of small so you have to arrive early. It felt kind of crowded because we had a small table up against the wall. But if you come with a big group, you will probably get one of the big tables close to the window."}
{"text":"The pork loin cheese tonkatsu was really good. Tender and soft. My only concern is what kind of pork and chicken do they use. Organic, hormone-free and with pesticide-free feed or non-organic, full or hormones and fed a grain diet full of pesticides. They don't really talk about it in their menu, which leads me to believe that they use non-organic pork and chicken. I wish more restaurants cared about clearly communicating the quality and nature of ingredients they use in preparing their food."}
{"text":"I brought two buddies outside of the town here for lunch because I wanted them to experience the diverse dining experience in Toronto. Guess what? It was a not a bad choice at all.
My dining experience at Mr. Tonkatsu was generally pleasing. For the sides, the meal included cabbage salad, a bowl of rice and a bowl of miso soup. Not only that you can refill all of them, they were actually tasty. The cabbage salad with its house sesame dressing was really refreshing, and the rice was tasty, too (they used the chewy Korean rice). 
As for the pork cutlet - although the portion was not big, it withheld with its quality. The coat was extremely crispy, and the meat inside of it was juicy. On top of the special Tonkatsu sauce, it was really satisfying.
Lastly, I really, really appreciate Mr. Tonkatsu's hygiene. Before I left, I took a look at the kitchen counter & bar, and I saw how they prepared the meat. The sections were all well organized, and the meat looked really fresh. I felt really happy to have the meal there just by acknowledging this fact.


I will definitely come back for Mr. Tonkatsu's weekend specials (the burgers). I am excited about it.

(One interesting thing about this restaurant is that it seems the people work there are Korean. I thought they are Japanese haha.)"}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends on Saturday night. We had to wait a little bit, as the place is packed. But it was worth the time! The food tasted great, and the service was good too."}
{"text":"Cozy place! Staff is very friendly! little disappointed they are not ready for liquour yet. I ordered Donkastu with Cheese and it tasted good but too small portion for the price. Maybee I am coming back with my hubby."}
{"text":"Followed Yelp's recommendation on an inexpensive dinner near my hotel. I had the pork Tenderloin Tonkatsu with soba. Pretty filling meal for under $20. The miso and the soba noodles were good and the soup didn't taste super salty. I am a pretty big fan for Tonkatsu and this place ain't bad. I will be back again"}
{"text":"Its the best deep fried pork chop i have ever had.  Not oily at all. Every food item on the tray are of good quality. The sauce is amazing!  Not too sour. Cabbage on the side is fresh and cut evenly!  Miso soup has many seaweed!  Love it!

Environment is spacious.  Design is very japanese/korean. Simple and comfy."}
{"text":"Best tonkatsu I have ever tried so far ! Highly recommand ! Can wait to have it again"}
{"text":"Went for the first time yesterday, and it was very good! I had the Chicken set (i think) and it was great. Before the food was served, they provided us with a mortal and pestle containing sesame seeds, which we had to grind up while we were waiting for the food (the wait was not that long, it came very fast). Once the food came, you have to add the grind up sesame seeds onto the sauce. The cutlet by itself was very mediocre, but when you add the sauce on to it, it was DELICIOUS! Definitely would come back again!!"}
{"text":"Yumyumyum I love katsu. Any type of katsu. Actually, anything deep fried. Unfortunately I wasn't able to stomach a whole meal when I visited so I opted for a pound of Karage chicken wings with sweet sauce which I barely finished. The sweet sauce was interesting as it had some cinnamon-y flavour and was not so sweet. The wings themselves were breaded and crispy and came steaming in a cute little pot.
I'll definitely come back for a katsu dinner!"}
{"text":"Total disaster. I will never visit there again. ???????????????????????????????????????????????

* Miso soup: I could merely taste miso in it. ???????????????????
* Katsu curry: lukewarm rice with lukewarm curry. ??????????????(?????????????)
* Soba noodle: I can't believe it is soba noodle. ?????????????????????????????????
* Karaage: It is just lightly fried chicken with partly uncooked part. ????????????????????
* Tonkatsu Sauce: no comment... ???????????????

????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I hope you like Breaded Deep Fried Food. If so, Mr. Tonkatsu is the place for you. 

House baked fresh bread crumbs but I was still think it was a tad too oily and heavy. But we shared:

Karaage Wings ($5.50)
Pork Tenderloin Katsu ($13)

This method of cooking does seal in the juiciness. As the price of the set includes refills of miso soup, rice and cabbage, no one is going to leave here feeling hungry.

A word of warning, since it has an open kitchen concept, the floor is really really slippery from all the deep frying and of course you do smell like kitchen after eating here. Mr Tonkatsu much need A better ventilation system and a major cleaning."}
{"text":"Great katsu by Toronto standards! The unlimited rice, soup, and cabbage reminds me of Japan. The price for extra meat is not worth it in my opinion since it's almost another order. The katsu wasn't light but it wasn't heavy and not oily. I would definitely come here again when I crave for katsu."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and there was a bit of a line but the wait was quick.  I've been to both this location and the one that used to be near Yonge and Steeles and both were fantastic!  I've tried the pork tenderloin Katsu and pork Katsu with cheese and both were delicious!  I love the tangy katsu sauce and it tastes great mixed with the rice (which is unlimited along with the miso soup and cabbage salad, although with the portion size I've never had to ask for a refill and I eat quite a bit). The breading is light and crispy and the meat has never been dry.  The soba noodles were hot but very tasty.  Very strong seaweed fragrance though so if you don't like seaweed, skip the soba noodles.  The place was very clean and was even wheelchair friendly as their washroom was large enough and even had all the lock/emergency buttons at a good level.  I would definitely come back again and would try some of their apps as their karage and wings look and sound delicious too!"}
{"text":"Some of the best chicken katsu I've ever had. If you have a craving for some deep fried pork then this is the place for you to visit!

Everyone in our group ordered the same chicken katsu and it's extremely crispy while the meat is super tender.  The portion sizes are above average and the unlimited miso soup is a plus.  They all come with steamed rice and cabbage salad so you'll definitely be leaving full and satisfied.  

Overall, everyone was pleased with their meal and the service presented at Mr. Tonkatsu.  Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"One of the best tonkatsu in Toronto. Simply de-li-cious! The pork cutlet is crunchy on the outside and juicy tender on the inside. Love it love it love it!"}
{"text":"Friendly server. Good food! And the place looks cool! My boyfriend wanted hot sauce but had trouble finding a server."}
{"text":"We went to this place to eat right when the place opened up so it wasn't too busy and crowded yet. It was our first time eating here and I was not disappointed! Katsu is probably one of my favourite things to eat. I opted to try the regular chicken katsu dish with cheese. WITH CHEESE! The cheese was really good. The moment you pull one piece out, the cheese oozes out and gets really stretchy. The waitress brought out a small bowl with sesame seeds for us to grind to fully \"experience\" the full tonkatsu meal. That took about 5 minutes of our time - smelt really fresh. Afterwards we put the seeds into the katsu sauce; don't really know if it made much of a difference but the sauce was good nonetheless. Miso soup was also included with the meal and it was quite flavourful. I will come back here to eat for sure if I'm ever in the area again!"}
{"text":"tldr: A solid Korean-style Tonkatsu shop. Full katsu sets (salad, soup, rice, and katsu) for good prices $15. Ample seating. Punctual service.

This shop serves Korean-style katsu dishes. Korean katsu is flakier than traditional Japanese katsu. This shop is similar to Wako Donkasu in LA (for you LA yelpers). The meal sets are the go-to. Sets include cabbage salad, rice, miso soup, and katsu of your choosing. You can add curry on the side among other extras. It's not fancy, but it's good value and a solid dinner or lunch option."}
{"text":"I absolutely love tonkatsu, but it's usually something that I indulge in when I am in Asia. I was delighted to find Mr.Tonkatsu in Toronto, complete with unlimited miso soup, salad, and rice - just like the way it's done in Japan! 

I tried both the pork loin and pork tenderloin, and I have to say that I do prefer the pork tenderloin just a touch more. My friend who tried the chicken katsu also raved about it, so I will be trying that one next. 

It's a small restaurant so seating is limited. Service was friendly, but the food could've have come a little faster. That said, I would definitely come back for more yummy tonkatsu!"}
{"text":"The food is okay... There's no option for me since I'm on a diet, everything was deep fried. I think they should add teriyaki or other non-fried options. I ordered the pork loin with cheese, tastes okay but nothing surprising. I'd give a 3.5/5, but not 4/5. Nice place to enjoy a meal, not mind-blowing."}
{"text":"The price s reasonable, cheese tonkatsu is soooo delicious."}
{"text":"Got the cheese tonkatsu and although it was the most expensive on the menu ($15) but was worth the upgrade. The pork wasn't greasy and it was full of flavour. Overall, it was exceptionally tasty--Comes with a salad, miso soup and rice which was more than enough to fill me. 

Wait time was quite a while but the service was definitely a 10/10! Small little restaurant with a great potential and food!"}
{"text":"Definitely the closest thing you can find in the city for authentic tonkatsu. Crispy outside and moist pork inside; the pork cutlet is cooked just right not leaving a greasy but more a crisp and clean finish on the panko. 

Only pitfall is the size is relatively small for one person, so this is great for lunch portions and possibly need 1-2 sides for dinner."}
{"text":"Very good! Very welcoming servers who will patiently explain the menu as well as how you prepare your dipping sauce.

I had the pork loin katsu, which was deliciously filled with cheesy goodness. It was very well executed because it was light and crispy and drained well - not oily for a fried pork chop. The sides were also just right. The price was reasonable and I was also told that the salad, rice, and miso soup could be refilled! I would return to try the chicken next time."}
{"text":"If you're looking for deep fried Japanese comfort food, Mr. Tonkatsu delivers a simple yet authentic experience. Their pork katsu is crispy yet tender, however the karaage was quite plain. I don't usually eat salad but their salad dressing was refreshingly delightful, probably the best I've had so far."}
