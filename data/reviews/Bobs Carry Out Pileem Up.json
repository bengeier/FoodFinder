{"text":"Pile'em up Bob's is another spot that's been around forever.  They've changed over years as far as management as the original owner was known to 'pile' your plate up with food to the point that it would barely close if it closed at all.  They're known for the burgers and fish, but they also sell breakfast food, subs, hot dogs, gizzards and the usual artery clogging foods.  I was sad to see that the new owners use what seem to be frozen burgers now but the original owner made the real deal homemade burgers from ground meat.  The food is still good and the portions though not as huge as before, is still quite a bit of food.  It is completely take out only and they do take debit cards($5.00 minimum).    As an fyi, if you're fearful of going to the hood this may not be the spot for you."}
{"text":"Ok, so I moved to NC 9 months ago. My Dad calls me and asked me if I have tried \"Pile Them Up\", before. I said \"No, what is that???\" He said, it's a Mom/Pop type place with no seats, where they \"pile up\" the food. I said that's cool, but is it good??? He insisted that it was, so we decided to go there when he came into town.   So off we go to Pile Em Up. Easy enough to locate. When we walked in, there is a sizable waiting area and the menu signage is very basic/economical. The employee was nice enough. We had a group of 6, so there was a variety of items ordered.   I ordered a basic bacon cheeseburger. It was ok, but I rated it a 6. Mainly because the burger (itself) was a little dry (so I'm glad i asked for ketchup & mustard) and the lettuce had no crunch. The lettuce was just there for show/color. But the good thing about the burger was that it was a decent size and it had a good amount of REAL bacon on it. I got onion rings with mine, and yes.... I got a \"good\" amount.   Other items that were ordered were chicken tenders, flounder, liver & gizzards. Listen............ I'm not going to rate the liver or gizzards because I DONT GET DOWN LIKE THAT!!! I refuse to eat either. I remember then both making me sick as a child, so as an adult, I now have a choice not to eat them..... so I wont. LOL BUT, from what I was told, both were decent, 6-7 range.  My daughter had chicken tenders and said they were pretty good. The looked pretty standard. I tried my Dad's flounder, and I have to say that I wish I had ordered that. I thought it was cooked very well.They were tender and juicy.. and his order came with a good amount of food.   Everything was cooked fresh and came out hot. The prices were very fair. It costed me $60 for 6 people to order an entree and a soda. I'm not mad at that. But I will say, even thought I felt I got my money's worth, with a name like \"Pile Em Up\", I was expecting MASSIVE quantities. **From what I have heard/read, this place has had various name changes (but now it says \"Bob's) AND used to be known to really pile the food up to where your containers were tough to close...... but those days are over.   Either way, try it out if in the area. I had to drive about 35 minutes to get there, so I will never drive that far just to go there again...... especially when you have to go someplace else (or your car) to eat it. This spot wasn't bad at all, I just gave it a 2 based on the description of a 2 rating (Meh. I've had better).   By the way, I noticed a 98.5 health rating posted on the wall....... pretty good for a hole in the wall spot. :)"}
{"text":"I went once years ago i forgot about they was there but Im going today June 4th 2018. They have really good choice of food many burgers. Its going to be hard to choose but Im giving it a shot today"}
{"text":"If you want a lot of food, this is the place for you.  If you want a lot of good food, not so much.  The burgers are huge, but overcooked, dry and tasteless ; this is the one time bacon didn't help.  The fries cold with no added salt.  The service is fast and friendly. I suppose there is a customer for this type of place; sadly it's not me."}
{"text":"You can't eat it here! So I've finally made it into Bob's Carry Out (after about 7 name changes this is the name). As a kid I always passed by here and I've always heard it was good. Yes, indeed it was good. I think I ate one of the biggest burgers I've ever in North Carolina today. Like any other In & Out burger joint there were frozen patties used but it was doctored up just right. The choices as to what to put on your burger is endless. The burger was just so big. When I started eating it, it became messy not in a greasy type of way but just with all the toppings falling off. I was in a fat mans heaven. The edges were a little burnt and the burger may have been a little dry (Just a little) I guess that's the reason for all the toppings. From hearing others talk about this place I guess they have some of the best fish and gizzards in Charlotte, I wouldn't know because I'm on a burger binge this week. I would recommend people try this place I mean really they have been around for at least 7 years minimum (hints the name change 7 times, at least that's what it feels like.) I got a bacon double cheeseburger with ketchup, mustard, mayo, coleslaw, chili and a ton of fries for $7.00, it was money well spent.  The atmosphere: Yes the neighborhood is sort of \"In the hood\" but I'm not stranger to a rough area I mean pretty much you've been to one you been to them all. There's no legit paved parking lot just gravel and the building is there for one reason to house those big ass burgers. You really are there just to pick food up and leave there is no dinning area."}
{"text":"Got a shrimp platter and it was okay. You get a nice amount of food but it wasn't anything to write home about. Might try something else on the menu and see if my view changes"}
{"text":"Every time I pull up I am succumbed to the smell of food heaven. I mean the smell really entices you.  Don't let this Hole in the Wall, Carry out place pass you by. While this place may not be the best place ever it is solid decent eats. The menu is simple. Burgers, hotdogs and a few assortment of fried foods. They also have breakfast but I have yet to slide through for breakfast.  Call ahead to place your order for you pick-up. Depending on the time of day, the line can be long and there is no place to sit as it truly is a carry out place.  If you order a burger ask for medium so they don't kill the cow twice to make your burger. It still won't be medium but it won't be overly dry.  Onions rings are the frozen breaded variety but since you are carrying your food to go, they hold over better than the fries."}
