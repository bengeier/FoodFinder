{"text":"Had drinks at the bar prior to dinner. Bartender was not very friendly and provided us sub-par service for what is supposed to be an upscale restaurant/bar. Martini's were mediocre, not terrible but nothing great. Whenever you see bartenders pouring booze into a shot glass to measure it's not a good sign, usually shows they aren't very good at making drinks. So anyway, bar experience was not up to reasonable standards. 

For dinner we sat in the window deuces. Very nice view, the seats were comfortable but they also sit very low. The table came up almost to my fiance's neck. They aren't very practical. As other reviewers have commented initial service was very lacking. No one approached us after being seated for close to 15 minutes, maybe longer. No water, no drink orders. Once we ordered a bottle of wine the front of house manager was unable to answer questions regarding the the differences in some of the varietals, as was the server that was then sent over. Finally we had a third server arrive to serve the bottle. He actually seemed knowledgeable and was able to answer questions. 1 for 3.

The menu looked pretty good, and the chef was able to accommodate a special request on the first course very nicely. However, the server did not mention any specials, or what the \"Chef's Inspiration Of The Day\" was. The food was good, above average but nothing fantastic. The filet I ordered had good flavor but was far from medium rare, closer to medium well. Not happy. Dessert was excellent. 

Although we had a good meal and a very good time here, ultimately it's not an excellent restaurant and that's almost all due to the service. If the servers were more knowledgeable, attentive, and engaged it would do wonders for this place, but until then it's just another restaurant with good food that is held back by the front of the house. We may give it another shot if we stay at The Westin Prince again, but otherwise there's no reason to return."}
{"text":"I don't know why I have never discovered the Season's oyster plate at their brunch before. One Sunday, my dad, my boyfriend and I came here for brunch and I was not expecting much, other than the usual fanfare of waffles, pancakes, sausages, creamed potatoes (which I love!)... But, to my immense pleasure, there was a full plate of huge oysters, and I happily piled them onto my plate (I think I left one for the person behind me - I'm not proud but...) That was the beginning of a beautiful love story.

Thus, I will always enjoy Season's brunch for the oysters which is the only thing I eat here (and then I will also have eggs, sausages and waffles just to even it out). During one sitting, I was so focused on devouring my oysters  that my dad counted at least 24 oysters' shells. For those who worry about freshness, I can safely say they are. I have never been sick.

They also have lots of other seafood selections such as crab, shrimp, and fish. For those who do not want fruits du mer for brunch, never fear, because Seasons has everything between the breakfast and lunch world to suit all fancies: rice, steak cuts, eggs, cheese, fish, vegetables, soup, and a selection of desserts.

The price for the brunch buffet is $45/person which is not the cheapest, but in my opinion, you get a lot of choices and variety for the money. It does get busy so I highly, HIGHLY recommend reservations.

Now for the off-brunch period, I have to say that lunch and dinners at Seasons is extremely average. I would actually go there for drinks and the atmosphere because the recent renovation has made the restaurant much more airy and light. They even have tables right beside the window, but if you do not like people walking by you all the time (it's not heavy traffic) then sit on the upper, raised level. The upper level has these cute circular booths that my parents and I always try to reserve.

I will also be staying at the Prince for a wedding this weekend so stay tuned for more reviews about the actual hotel!"}
{"text":"I dined at Seasons because I was staying at the Westin.  I found the menu to be extremely overpriced, at $95 for one main, two drinks and two desserts between myself and my husband.  The service was slow, and the server didn't seem to understand our requests due to a language barrier.  

The food and drinks however were quite good.  The chicken curry was really quite good, with the perfect amount of spice, and was plentiful enough to be filling.  The flourless chocolate cake was decadent and satisfying after the spicy curry.  Drinks were creative and strong."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Westin for business and it was already late, so i decided to eat at the expensive Seasons restaurant.  We sat by the window which has a wonderful view. The food is very expensive and the portions are very small, however it tasted good. The sides are a la cart. The service was incredibly slow and the place was empty.  Additionally there was a significant language barrier with the waitress which made ordering a big challenge. I would not go back due to the incredibly poor service."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for every [Parent's] Day for the last two years or so. At $50+ a person, I really expect more from them. 

Mother's Day was great, and food had variety and lots of selection.  They had an odd thing, instead of a omelette station, there was a make on the spot egg benedict, which made no sense as there is hardly any customization.  THe worst part was that the poached egg was already cooked and sitting in cold water - the chef had to heat it up before serving, and it still remains only lukewarm. They got rid of this and went back to the omelette station that next time we came. 

For Dad's day, it wasn't to par with the previous visit.
Oysters did not have usual shallot vinegar to be served on the side. I do not like the tomato sauce. When I asked them about it, the servers had no idea what I was talking about.  

For the main courses, other than breakfast foods, you're getting lamb, chicken, some veggies, potato and a carving station for roast beef. 

Less choice in dessert (only bread pudding - same and some standard cakes - no chocolate mousse or anything different)

Overall, it's quite a treat, and there isn't really anything else in the area to dress up and go to on such an occasion. They need to make the main buffet area bigger instead of being stuck in such a small room. 
However, I think there are other buffets in town that provid ea better value for your money."}
{"text":"The greeter denied us of available table by the window (she lied, we saw later) & asked us to hang our jackets ourselves but did for others.

The food is just ok for $90 Valentine's dinner. The food came out slow & there was always something missing or forgotten and the dessert was way too sweet. The server gave us a chocolate dipped strawberry to make up for the dessert. I found out it was part of the dessert in the menu."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the buffet brunch at Seasons on a Saturday morning. At nine o'clock, it was relatively empty; however, within fifteen minutes, most tables were accounted for. Clientele include both hotel guests and 'randoms' like myself. Considering you're in the middle of the lobby of a hotel, the restaurant gives a very relaxed vibe with large windows that expose the greenery around the Prince. There's a parking lot on site; remember to sign in your car with the hostess. The buffet has a lot of selection, including an omelette station and bottomless Starbucks brewed coffee. There's enough variety that anyone can eat here. It's available every day of the week for $23. Service was excellent.

Good for: brunch, breakfast, dates, celebrations"}
{"text":"I used to go to the Westin Prince for brunch when i was much younger, at the time the hotel was just called The Prince Hotel. Sunday brunch there was on of the top places in Toronto for brunch in their grand ballroom. They went all out with huge lobsters, caviar, 6-8 hot dishes, king crab legs, desserts etc. We went at least once a month.After many years the hotel changed ownership and they no longer offered their grand extravagant buffet and the hotel was renovated. I was so happy to find out that they once again offered a Sunday brunch buffet. 

My review 4/5 is based solely on the food - not the service i received. Front of the house service 1/5. The server we had for our table 4/5

On a whim I called Seasons at the Prince. I wanted to find out what their brunch buffet options were and how much the brunch was. I also wanted to bring up a food allergy i have and ask if there's any way to find out if there would be cause for concern should we go eat there. My first issue was the person I spoke to. She didn't address what i was saying, didn't even seem to be focused on what i was asking her. I didn't call while the restaurant was busy, I called 1 hour before they even opened. Then she put me on the phone with someone else (who i later found out was the manager) who was rude and rushing me off the phone when i repeated my questions.  Normally when i call a restaurant and mention a food allergy, the host, hostess or manager tells me that they will have the chef do a walk through the buffet to answer any questions. This is especially important as my daughter also has an allergy to all nuts.

We arrived at 12:30pm and noticed that not even 1/4 of the tables were filled up. The manager gave us a table by the window, fantastic view of the gardens & forest behind the hotel, but he was rude & abrupt with us when we asked a couple of questions. 

We found that although the table had a fantastic view, it was ridiculously small to fit coffee, water, coffee carafe, side plates and our brunch buffet plates. Also we were the only ones sitting along the windows while everyone else had cozy booths or banquet seating (FYI i requested a booth when i called - they didn't say they were all reserved). We asked our server if we could get a larger table and she said she had to ask her manager. The manager insisted that every table we pointed to was reserved already. They ended up seating us in the section almost beside the hostess near the entrance which was an unusual spot because there were no other tables near it. Almost like it was tables just pushed out of the way (because they had a large table set up for 10-12). So far - not impressed! My husband looked at the manager and said \"we could leave if you'd like?\".  My husband also expressed how we weren't happy with the service we were receiving. The managers quick answer was no, but he offered no apology. Our server saved the day and made us feel welcome, drinks were topped up and she made sure we were happy and enjoying our meal. Whether it was for a tip or because she was making up for the rude manager, she did good.

The food & selection of their brunch buffet is top notch! They had 3 hot trays of mains, prime rib, breakfast items (waffles, eggs benedict, pancakes, bacon etc.), rice, roast potatoes, steamed vegetables, mashed potatoes.  Great selection of dim sum & fresh made sushi, lobster, seafood antipasto, mussels. Plus an entire table of antipasto items (cold cuts, salads, caprese salad, dolmas etc.). I'm sure i'm missing items, but wow, the food selection was impressive and tasted REALLY good! Dessert they offered, macarons, different mousses, huge chocolate dipped strawberries and a variety of items. Way too many items to list! 

I was just thrown off with the price of $60 per person. When i called I asked the manager how many mains they offered in their hot trays, the answer was 6 or 7. This is totally misleading because 4 of them were side dishes. For $60 per person i expect to have at least 4-5 main dishes which is what most hotels offer. Also, in the 2 hours we were there, not even 1 of the so called reserved tables were taken. Only 1 party of 2 walked in and was seated.

If you're thinking of taking your kids there? Kids ages 2-12 are half price! Yep, $30 for your 2 year old to eat their brunch buffet. I get the price for older kids, but wow, i'd be paying $30 for my 4 year old to eat 1 pancake with bacon. Not even any kid friendly dishes offered in the buffet."}
{"text":"I've eaten breakfast here many times while staying at the Westin and was never dissapointed. The breakfast buffet has all your needs covered. Omelette bar...check. Full unhealthy section of eggs, bacon, sausage and all that heavy send you back to bed food.....check. A great fresh fruit and healthy section... check check. Loads of breads, muffins and bagels. Check. Even multiple choices of smoked fish and Salmon? How decadent. The wide selection of all fresh delicious food here is wide and refilled quite often. There are lots of places to sit and the service is friendly and attentive in the morning. What else can you ask for. Sure it's not a cheap breakfast however if you fill yourself to the gills then all you need is a smaller lunch! We enjoy it and I hope you do as much as we do.

I'm surprised to see all the negative review here. Keep in mind folks, I don't believe I've ever been to a Westin hotel where the food prices are not hyper inflated. Thus it does not surprise me for lunch or dinner all the cat calls of how expensive it is. However for breakfast it's pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Im staying at Westin. Second time I've eaten here. Will not come back. Stale bread. Had beat salad. Had one bite. Got chicken stir fry. The mall has better. Waaaay over priced. Even wine is bad. I'll go hungry over eating here ever again. 
Only redeeming quality is nice servers."}
{"text":"Took my wife here for the Valentine's Day dinner. This restaurant is located in the Westin Prince Hotel. We had the window seat overlooking the ravine, I felt like I was in the woods yet in the middle of the city. 

Was very busy that night. Our server was very attentive, always checking to see if I needed another Gin & Tonic.  He was friendly and provide excellent service.

We went for the 5 Course Prix Fix. At the end of our mea, we definitely felt it was the right decision. You rarely see those prix fix at the restaurant if your frequently dine here. Everything was well put together. Delicious and innovative. In the end the dinner was very good!

Would try their Sunday brunch if we visit here again."}
