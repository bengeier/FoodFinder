{"text":"Amazing!!! This is the best ice cream i have ever tasted! The place is also really nice on the inside, will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Two Scoops is a wonderful locally owned shop with a variety of flavors. We hope to see non dairy offerings in the future."}
{"text":"I am not an ice cream eater but after eating at Two Scoops, I am hooked. The owners are perfect gentlemen, the quantity was perfect and the taste was out of this world.  No matter where you live in Charlotte, NC, you have got to go and purchase this creamy treat."}
{"text":"The best ice cream I've had in a while. Creamy vanilla base is so good. I got the vanilla heath and it was delightful. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Two Scoops??? I think one scoop is plenty for most :) This ice cream shop is amazing and worth checking out next time you're in the Plaza Midwood area. I got a scoop of cookies & cream, sat at the kiddie table, and became entranced by the colorful artwork on the walls. This is an easy recommendation and a great addition to both PM and CLT as a whole."}
{"text":"I don't think this place needs my review to prove that it's great, but I am giving it one anyways. Two Scoops is creative, relaxed, and delicious. It has it's own parking lot on Central, which is a huge plus. There are cute murals and pumping music (typically pop) and it's not stuffy at all. There is inside and outside seating....they could probably have more inside seating if they invested in it, because they have the room.  The line moves fast and the staff is happy to let you try a flavor. They have great rotating flavors that include Teddy Grahams, Fruity Pebbles, Capt'n Crunch, Heath, Butterfinger, Cake, Salted Caramel, etc. The Cookie Monster and Krazy Kake ones seems very popular.. The waffle bowls are my preferred choice.   And tip- two scoops really is more like four scoops. It's a lot of ice cream. I have eaten half of mine, thrown it in the freezer, and eaten it the next day- it was still good."}
{"text":"Amazing ice cream! Had the krazy kake and it was delicious and scoops were plentiful. They didn't have many flavors but we will definitely stop in again to try other flavors"}
{"text":"The ice cream here was ok. Nothing really memorable except maybe how bright blue their Cookie Monster flavor was. Tasted ok, but couldn't bring myself to eat something so artificially blue."}
{"text":"Love love love two scoops creamery! They have unique flavors and you can tell the ice cream is homemade. The service is great and the line moves rather quickly. I ordered the cookie crunch and cookie dough ice cream in a waffle bowl. My son ordered the Cookie Monster ice cream in a cup. My son is a picky eater but if he said that it was good...trust me it's good lol! The only reason I am giving them four stars is because the parking is terrible. Other than that we will be back!"}
{"text":"This place HANDS DOWN has the best ice cream in Charlotte. But don't expect your favorite flavor to be there twice in the same week, they're rotated or just as quickly as they are consumed. My only recommendation is to add their flavor list with descriptions on the wall; customers get bottle necked when it is time to order because they're just seeing the flavors for the first time."}
{"text":"I stopped by for my 1st time for their 1 year Anniversary. I like the bright murals inside and out. Even little tables for kids. Parking is kind of tight. I can imagine how it can be on a peak day. But no problem today. After I passed the dj spinnin tunes out side, I was greeted and told I can try whatever I like. I tried the rum raisin and I was pleased. I got a scoop. My bf saw Yabba Dabba Doo (vanilla with fruity pebbles) and was drawn to it. I talked to the 3 guys that own the place. One was happy because we're both Patriots fans. I entered a drawing they are having to celebrate their milestone. I wish this place the best and I'll be back!  PS: Don't forget to redeem your 10% off when you check in like I did!"}
{"text":"Just had the best ice cream ever!!!!!!!  Friendly staff and lots of ice cream flavors.  We all loved the ice cream and we will be coming back again"}
{"text":"This is a bit of a trek for us, but we have stopped here a few times after dinner or attending an event in the area.  They have a decent variety of flavors, and we have really enjoyed every flavor we have tried so far.  Last time we were there, I had a cheesecake flavor that was fantastic!  Prices are average, staff is really nice, and we enjoy sitting in their outside seating area.  The only drawback is parking is a bit difficult.  The lot is small and awkwardly shaped.  Both times we were there, the lot was full and we had to wait several minutes for someone to leave.   Not a huge deal, and worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Love the decor. Not a million flavors, but definitely enough, particularly from a homemade place. A good combo of unique and classic flavors.   I love the location. They have a lot of tables inside and out, and fantastic murals also inside and out. Makes for a very cute, insta-worthy atmosphere. I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"I've been here about a dozen times, and love it!   The ice cream is fantastic! You can have unlimited samples to find your love. As for the decor the outside with the sign painted on the wall has improved  ten fold. It looks really good!! The inside seating and fun paintings are also perfect for this cute little place!    My Selections:  Strawberry- Incredible and definitely my favorite  Toasted Coconut- incredible first bite, then I felt the coconut was overwhelming the ice cream and way too chewy.   Praline n cream- yummy, but not my ultimate favorite   My friend's Selections:  Heath- completely Devine!! She loves the tinny bits of heath and finds happiness eating it!!  Oreo- Excellent!!"}
{"text":"Yea for two scoops!!! I don't think the others compare at all. Great ice cream, small quant shop.. I will definitely frequent ice cream here often with the family n friends!  Thanks two scoops, and congrats on the new Mooresville location."}
{"text":"Best ice cream in Charlotte. The place is a hole in the wall with little parking and long lines, but the ice cream rocks. I used to make ice cream for a living for a chain here in Charlotte, so I know good ice cream. This is good ice cream."}
{"text":"Came here with my brother on his off day and they were slammed! But still so fast at serving everyone and so kind! The ice cream flavors were unique and equally delicious. I got the cookie monster flavor and it was like a dream come true! The paintings on the wall were so cool and fun, the little kids really enjoyed them too! I will be returning to try more flavors! :)"}
{"text":"Maybe I will change my mind after a couple of visits. I felt the ice cream was lacking flavor (may be due to what I ordered). Did try my friends ice cream and felt the same way about hers too. Definitely not on Elizabeth creamery's level but it's a start. Not bad not excellent"}
{"text":"Great Ice Cream...had coffee cookies & cream and a birthday cake type with just cake and sprinkles , no frosting (forgot the name!) In a cup. .Wife had  chocolate in a waffle cone..Probably the best coffee ice cream I've ever had! Went at a perfect time,  waited on as soon as we arrived. ..Definitely recommended. ."}
{"text":"I'm in love with the interior of this place and they also offer outdoor seating. There were so many yummy choices that it was hard to decide, but we finally came to the agreement on Ted and Bart. Both of the flavors mixed so well together, we were not disappointed. I can't wait to come back and try the rest of the flavors!"}
{"text":"Great Ice cream. Great location. Super cool save. Love the art work. I have every intention of eating my way through all the flavors. The music and the vibe was great. We skipped dessert at a restaurant and indulged in Two Scoops instead. Best decision ever."}
{"text":"Stopped by for some ice cream after dinner. Staff was friendly and recommended Bart (vanilla with butterfinger) and added Reeces cups. Friends got Oreo salted Carmel. Son got cookie dough. All enjoyed. Tables, TV and colorful funky art murals. Plus got the 10% discount for checking in. Ample parking and right on the outskirts of uptown and close to plaza midwood."}
{"text":"I gave up dairy and gluten almost a year ago at the urging of my naturopath. I did it grudgingly because it impacted eating out so much. And how was I going to survive an entire summer without ice cream??? It's un-American I tell ya. Fast forward 10 months and 30 lbs later I survived summer but had tried several store-bought coconut milk, cashew and other type of ice \"creams\". This is TMI so let me move on.   So one night hubs wanted a cold sweet treat and we decided to try this new place which is just a mile from our new pad. We walk in to the warehouse-y feeling place and notice on the flavor board there are 4 vegan ice cream options using coconut milk and agave. Dude!! My arms shot up like we got a touchdown. I got to have a treat too. But to be honest I had limited hope that it would be good so I tried a couple. I tried the Sea Salt Chocolate and the Cookies and Cream vegan options. The Cookies and Cream was legit y'all. Seriously amazing. I decided to cheat on the GF because I'm less sensitive than dairy because this was seriously the best non-cream ice cream I've ever had. In fact hubs tried a couple regular flavors and ended up with something good but not as amazing as my Cookies and Cream vegan ice cream! He said he'd order it next time.  The consistency isn't as smooth as typical ice cream on the spoon yet in the mouth it's perfect. Also I've obviously had a lot of coconut ice cream before and this one tasted the least coconutty I've had. Sometimes I don't mind it if it goes with the flavor but this was perfect. Touchdown indeed.  I do have to agree with Camille that the lighting was a little freaky so it doesn't create an appetizing ambiance but that's OK because I'll get it to go or eat outside. We are totally going to be regulars."}
{"text":"Two Scoops,   You're such an adorable little ice cream shop! When I stopped in on Sunday afternoon everyone was so helpful and friendly! And you didn't make it easy for me...with all your yummy flavor creations. But I just want to say THANK YOU the creative genius that put all my favorite things together and created the Cookie Monster flavor. I'd order it again and again. I can't wait to come back!   Thanks!  Candyce B"}
{"text":"Huge huge fan of this spot.  Great to have a local, handcrafted creamery in Plaza.  Cookie Monster ice cream was the ish."}
{"text":"Though these guys are new, I see them sticking around for a while. Long line that moved pretty quickly. Servers were very friendly and the inside is colorful, cozy and eclectic. I went with the cookies and cream and vanilla caramel cookie in a waffle cone. I was shocked at how good the vanilla caramel cookie was. Also tried the Krazy Cake, which was delicious. Hope to be back here soon!"}
{"text":"So, I'm super picky about ice-cream, but I just loved this one. Tried the butter pecan and rum raisin. Both delicious, and the texture of the ice-cream is amazing, smooth and creamy, had to get seconds of rum raisin. I also tried some of my husband's chocolate peanut butter and even though I don't usually like this combo, this one was great, not overly sweet. Definitely coming back for more"}
{"text":"Tasty and not overly sweet flavors. Line moved pretty quickly and you get 10% off for checking in. We will definitely come back to try more flavors."}
{"text":"Best ice cream ever!  Fun creative flavors and delicious classics. My personal fave (so far) is Papi Crunch with Cap'n Crunch cereal. Soooo good!  My husband had good ol' classic chocolate and loved it.  Really cute spot, clean, and super friendly staff.  Awesome addition to the the neighborhood. We will be back a LOT!"}
{"text":"Great service and great ice cream! The owners checked on me and my friend the whole time. They were so friendly, and discussed the different flavors with us!"}
{"text":"Where have you been all my life?!   I initially tried to go to Two Scoops during their Friends and Famly opening... except I'm sadly not a friend or family. We saw lights and ice cream and thought YES! Unfortunately, we weren't accepted as besties that night, so returned when it opened to the commoners. Nonetheless, I LOVE Two Scoops! I think I've been back 5 or 6 times.. most of which were within the first month of opening. I've tried the Strawberry, Toasted Coconut, Cookie Dough, Mint Chocolate Chip, and so much more! Literally any flavor tastes better once blessed by the hands of Two Scoops. Who knew that something so small and quaint could make me so happy! I understand it's Winter, but I will still be back soon!"}
{"text":"Really good ice cream and they have lots of flavors to try. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I found my favorite ice cream place in Charlotte! Got the \"not your mama's pumpkin pie\" and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious ice cream. I had Cookies by the Sea and Bartman. Both were creamy and fabulous, but Cookies by the Sea is the best by a long shot! My only suggestion would be to add more Butterfinger to Bartman because I could barely taste any in it. Was a great chocolate ice cream, though! Service was fast and friendly. Can't wait to go back and try more flavors."}
{"text":"Happy to see a stand alone, locally owned ice cream shop! Came here one day on a beautiful, sunny Sunday afternoon to see we weren't alone in the ice cream craving! There were several employees working, so there wasn't a wait in getting ice cream or paying for it. I got the Cookie Monster flavor & it was delicious! And getting two scoops seemed more like three, but I wasn't complaining. :)   Catchy names & numerous flavors, it was hard to choose! Prices are great, too.  Parking, not so great, so be mindful of that."}
{"text":"2 scoops of yumminess!! Looks like I found my go to Ice Cream place. My ice cream was creamy and rich in taste."}
{"text":"Finally made it here. They havens of flavor options and even vegan choices. It's not your typical ice cream shop. They have unique flavors you haven't had before with unique ingredients like cereals and such. Tons of choices for everyone. They even have baked goods from move that dough baking co. Sometimes. It's a cool spot with great ice cream and cool people serving it. Try the Cookie Monster that was my favorite!"}
{"text":"So many reviews noted vegan options that I convinced several non-vegan friends to drive across town to go to this place last night. Of course, we get there to learn there were no options yesterday so the five of us just left.  The staff was nice and apologetic, so 3 stars for now and will try this place one day to add some stars."}
{"text":"Dangerous that this place is now open in my neighborhood. But I'm so happy that it is, after salivating over all their social media pics of their homemade ice cream flavors this summer. Plaza Midwood has so been lacking in the ice cream dept. (Still missing a fro-yo option though). Love all the classic & funky flavor mashups Two Scoops offers. I was bummed they were out of the fudge lined waffle bowls, but they promise there's more on the way! Just gives me another excuse to go back, not like I needed one. These people are super friendly & helpful. Excited they're here & hope they do great!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try two scoops, as I am a huge fan of homemade hard ice cream and I was disappointed. The ice cream was more icey in texture than I wanted it to be, especially compared to Ben and Jerry's. The flavors were good, although I cannot recommend the Cinnamon Toast Crunch pieces that were in the Ted ice cream. They turned into a gross texture. It was also very pricey, which I anticipated, but I wouldn't say it was worth the price."}
{"text":"There is really nothing more to say other than this is friggin delicious ice cream, great service, and serving size is crazy-big. Thankfully...this place isn't closer to my house."}
{"text":"Best ice cream spot in Charlotte hands down. The Cookie Monster is so good and the staff is always energetic and friendly!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I stopped in here today for a sweet treat and oh boy, it was DELICIOUS!!!! The employees were so friendly and helpful. We must've tried 10 different flavors before deciding. He went with the Papi Crunch and Capt Jack. I had the Capt Jack and cookies and cream. This was probably the best ice cream I've ever had. Seriously. Do yourself a favor and go there!! You won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"This place always has a long line and is near my house so I thought I would try it one night while craving icecream.  Even though the icecream is hand made I didn't think it was that spectacular.    I thought that the toppings were lacking and they poured my chocolate chips out from a bag which I thought was bizarre.  They should have the toppings nicely displayed.  Expecially for a location in such a trendy neighborhood.   My other critique was the design of the shop.  It seemed kind of outdated for such a new place, and the glowing lights hurt my eyes.   I am trying not to be so harsh on such a new place, it may take time for them to get their stuff together. But still, they should have put in alot more effort expecially during their first few months.  I wish them the best but will probobly not come back here again anytime soon."}
{"text":"We came here for dessert tonight since we drive by this place all the time and have never gone inside. I'm glad we did this time! The minute you walk in the employees greet you with a smile and the most sincere, \"how are you guys!\", like we've met before. They were extremely welcoming! They recommended we try the cookie monster flavor and the blueberry cheesecake and they definitely did not disappoint! The cookie monster was hands down my favorite! Which wasn't even one of the ones I myself ordered. My bf picked it and I ate most of his. The fruity pebbles and the cookie dough were the other two we tried and they were also very good. It got packed pretty quickly so I'm glad we got there when we did. Even though it was raining and freezing outside that ice cream really hit the spot. Nothings better than having some good homemade ice cream. Yes! They make it themselves. They should get an award for that. It was delicious!!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out today. I noticed a rather young staff when I walked in, makes sense... ice cream place, summer jobs, the usual. Except this staff actually gives a crap and seem to love their job(s). I'm in the service industry, and trust me, that's not always the case.   We got to try a bunch of flavors, AND everyone was super helpful. Unlike some of the reviews I've seen on here, the portion size was plentiful in my opinion. Pricing was right on point with what you expect at a quaint yet trendy ice cream spot; yes, it's going to be more than Dairy Queen, but you're paying for quality, options, service, etc etc.  My only wish is that there was a little more seating. And more parking. But that'll come in time I'm sure."}
{"text":"Fun little place with a wide selection of flavors, even in the winter months.  Neat murals and seating for kids, and I especially enjoyed the blues music playing during our visit.  I ordered the wedding cake ice cream and my granddaughter fell for the Cookie Monster--she won!  It was the more delicious of the two!"}
{"text":"The best ice cream I've ever had! Tastes so good. The butter pecan and pistachio are so good. Sherbet is good too."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place of all of charlotte. I have a hugeeee sweet tooth and feel like two scoops keeps it satisfied every time. The staff is amazing, super friendly, always polite. I love the fact that I can come here and pig out or simply take my niece and nephew here for ice cream dates. It's in a great location and very vibrant as soon as you walk in. My favorite flavor is Papi Crunch and I really hope the serve it more often but honestly any flavor you try here I'm confident is a good one. Sucks I couldn't provide pictures for this review but honestly I always have a one track mind here and by the time I scarf down my ice cream it's way too late lol"}
{"text":"Modernized ice cream shop in the Charlotte area located on Central Ave. Not your typical ice cream flavors. Multiple varieties of ice cream and toppings available to meet your sweet tooth needs! And flavors can change occasionally."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place a while ago, but never really had a chance to check it out. I was craving some good ice cream and while checking an Instagram page I saw a really nice picture of an ice cream and for my surprise the ice cream was from Two Scoops Creamery. I felt that it was destiny so my husband and I jumped in the car to get some ice cream. We got there around 8:30pm and they close at 9pm on Sundays. Even though hasn't been warm in a while they were pretty busy. I decided to get just one scoop because I am really trying to be a good girl and cut some sugar, but boy I' gonna to tell ya, this has been hard! The staff is really cool and friendly, they let you try as many flavors as you want so you can decided which one you will get. I love the painting on the walls, so colorful and happy, just like summer :) My husband got a thin mint and a raspberry chocolate chip, I had the roasted coconut. My husband loved his ice cream, I tried the thin mint and tasted just like Girl Scout cookies, soooooo good! My roasted coconut was the best coconut ice cream I've ever had, I could eat gallons and gallons of that ice cream. Oh, when I checked in I got a 10% discount from Yelp, which was cool! They also accept suggestion about ice cream flavors, I am not sure if anyone from the staff will ready this but I'd suggest pineapple ice cream and/or pineapple coconut ice cream. I bet it would be amazing! The only down side was that the place was not the clean. I understand they had only to people to serve the costumers and the place was busy, but the tables were a bit messy. I am looking forward to going back for more delicious ice cream !"}
{"text":"The ice cream was flavorful however I have two big problems.   One, we ordered a container of the chocolate mint with andes mint bars chopped up in it. There were very few chocolate pieces.   Two, and the biggest gripe, is the price. A small container (maybe 6\" tall almost the size of a big coffee mug) was almost $9. This gave my family of 4, four very small bowls. Like maybe a 1/2 cup per person.   By comparison, for the same price, at the Elizabeth Creamery, you can get a pint of ice cream. In our house that pint can last for 3 ice cream events (12 servings) in the same size bowl.   Dollar for dollar, elizabeth creamery is a far better deal. We wont be back to two scoops."}
{"text":"I've visited Two Scoops twice but I've only been able to enjoy their ice room one time.  The first time they were sold out and owner ran out to explain everything and was very apologetic.  What's to like:  The hours - they are open late! Rotating flavors - my favorite on a recent visit was the rum raisin Outside seating  There isn't a ton of ice cream in Charlotte and this is a welcome addition, plus the very friendly service is on point."}
{"text":"Two Scoops Creamery, thank you for pulling me out of the misconception that it was only Cold stone Creamery who served great, fun, multiple toppings, tasty, smooth, flavorful ice creams (in Charlotte area) YOU are only better. Amazing taste, just the right amount of smoothness and super flavorful and guess what GREAT portions and right pricing. This place doesn't look great or inviting or fancy or colorful with big bill boards or anything.  They just have one old fashioned board facing the road that says their name and their catchy tag line.  One wouldn't feel much about this place UNTIL they taste their ice cream.  Crazy cake and Ted are the two flavors we tried recently and YUMMM - Crazy cake - is a cake batter ice cream and sheet cake mix, trust me there was a lot of cake in this ice cream and we are suckers for ice cream cakes.  Ted is base french vanilla (i guess) with graham crackers mix and super YUMMM again,  Of course we tasted multiple other flavors and i loved their coffee flavor, wanna try it next time."}
{"text":"I love this new local creamery! So many fun flavors and a few vegan options, to boot. Definitely try the vegan super dark chocolate. They use coconut milk and it gives the ice cream just a subtle hint of that beachy flavor. Can't wait to try all their flavors!"}
{"text":"Dear Two Scoops, If I lived in the Plaza Midwood area, I'd get fat! Oh wait...  Kidding aside, this is some quality ice cream! It's homemade, unique flavors, and served by some really passionate people. Me and a few peeps dropped by on a busy Friday night but the two guys behind the counter were happier than ever keeping the line moving and serving up magic.  Like most of the reviews mention, the art is awesome. It's all ice cream themed and done by a local artist. Colorful and quirky, it matches the rest of the small shop. The building itself is very minimal but works for what they're doing, putting the passion in the sweets!  Flavors vary but the crowd-pleasers stick around for the most part. I got the red velvet in a waffle bowl in a regular bowl to try and keep it from getting messy. It, was, heavenly! Real cake and chocolate notes surrounding rich and creamy ice cream. Better than B&J's for sure (yeah, I said it! Fight me!).  Since it seems that it's a 2-man operation, I can see why the tables can get a bit messy. We had to kind of watch our elbows at the table, just keep that in mind. I'm sure they have the best of intentions, just hard to keep everything perfect with a line out the door.  The grocery store might be the easy option, but you're really missing out on the best if you're not coming here."}
{"text":"Two Scoops is a great addition to Plaza Midwood. I was surprised to see how many flavors they had. Tons of classics and just as many fun flavors. They are happy to explain any of the flavors and let you sample. I ended up with two scoops - chocolate thin mint & pralines and cream. I can't wait to get back and try more flavors!   They don't make their own waffle cones but the guy helping us said they were delish. Hope they start making their own soon!  Service was friendly, prices were fair, and no problems with finding parking or seating."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has four and a half stars. Butter pecan ice cream was good, but nothing special. No unique flavors when I went, just \"Heath this\" and \"Heath that\". Staff was friendly.   For ice cream, keep looking."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to check out this place, had heard great things, and was rather impressed. Fun playful atmosphere, inviting decor, colorful murals, lots of ice cream choices, wide variety of toppings.  To summarize -Ice cream lovers Disneyland!! We tried the wake me up, Cookie monster and Krazy kake. Krazy kake was my favorite.  Will be back to try out the other flavors."}
{"text":"Two scoops is my favorite ice cream and all of Charlotte in the surrounding areas. I was really excited and then open the lake Norman location in my home town of Mooresville. I love the service, the owners, and all the staff always super friendly and nice. Definitely give it a try for the best ice cream around town!"}
{"text":"Visiting the Charlotte area with family.  Wanted something sweet.  Honestly, I don't see how this place is rated so highly.  Maybe I chose wrong choice of flavors: coffee and muddle on a waffle cone.  Way too strong of flavor.  Coffee is one of my absolute favorite ice cream flavors but I was highly disappointed in it.  The muddle is chocolate ice cream with cookies, caramel and seems like it was one other thing but I can't remember.  Next time, I guess I should ask for samples first.  Lesson learned! I didn't even eat half of it.  My family was trying to encourage me to let them know I didn't like it but I just trashed it.  Probably better for me in the long run (less sugar and calories for the day).  My family said their selections were good.  If they'd like, they can come place their own reviews with higher stars.  This is mine."}
{"text":"Ice cream not bad.  Interesting flavors that change every week.  Very informative staff and plenty of room to sit.  Great for folks that live nearby and can walk.  Not sure why mural outside has a ice cream cone with ONE SCOOP instead of TWO."}
{"text":"I came to try out this creamery after seeing one of my friends post a picture of her ice cream earlier that day. So. Delicious. They have a lot of the typical flavors and then a couple unique ones, lots of toppings, plenty of seating, and some cool art painted on the walls. It was a fun place to relax and eat ice cream! The staff was really cool and friendly too. They give you a lot of ice cream for the price so it's definitely a good value for quality ice cream. Bonus: if you check in while waiting in line, you get a 10% off voucher through yelp."}
{"text":"Ice cream was very good and we're pretty sure it was homemade just based on the variety of flavors. We went on a Tuesday night and there were a few people in there and the gentleman serving us seemed a little frazzled to be the only worker. My wife asked for a cone and got hers served in a cup. My double scoop on a waffle cone was on the smaller side for what is charged. It's very good ice cream though."}
{"text":"This ice cream shop is really nice. The server was cute so that never hurts!  2 scoops please!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this was a quick run in before work, and I had never been to Two Scoops. What am amazing quick trip! The flavors were varied and the service very friendly. I taste tested the Pralines and Cream, and immediately knew that was THE one. 2 scoops in a bowl later (devastated I had to drive so couldn't get a cone wahhh), the pralines and cream was perfectly creamy. It was full of fresh, tasty pecans, and it. was. delicious. There's was not a single thing worth complaining about at this ice cream shop, and most importantly...the ice cream was divine. I can't wait to come with my husband and be able to relax inside!"}
{"text":"Two Scoops is the bomb.com. Ice cream is delicious and made in house. My favorite flavor is Cookies by the Sea (salted caramel with Oreos). Other great flavors are pralines n cream and Papi crunch. This place might say Two Scoops, but one is plenty! Scoops are huge, ice cream is cold, and store is hip."}
{"text":"Favorite ice cream place hands down!! Cookie monster is the best and the staff is chill and friendly. The inside is super inviting too. Nothing bad you could honestly say! (Maybe push the prices a bit lower tho hehe)"}
{"text":"Went to Two Scoops last Sunday on the recommendation of my fiancee. We got there at the right time (just before the end of a Panthers game) because they place was swamped soon after we ordered.  They have a great selection of ice creams between their two coolers. All of the typical flavors are represented (chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, etc.) and plenty of more exotic choices. I opted for the Thin Mint flavor, which had actual pieces of Thin Mint cookies. To die for is an understatement. One issue was I ordered a single scoop and it was the singlest of single scoops in single scoop history. Almost looked like the scooper just jammed the scoop in and yanked it out, a very disappointing portion.  Like I said, after we ordered the crowd arrived. We watched the end of the Panthers win against the Cardinals inside the bright but sparsely decorated \"dining room\" and sat at the picnic table outside. The service was quick and the \"ice cream artist\" was able to answer any questions I had. Would be interested in returning, but would be more observant of the scoop portion, but will probably spring for a double... just to be on the safe side."}
{"text":"I just found my new favorite treat in Charlotte! This place is awesome! Super friendly staff that let you try as many delicious samples as you want! The best ice cream I've ever had! We all got the Monster cookie and even got the pup a cup of vanilla, he even licked the bowl clean!! A must try!"}
{"text":"Second time visiting Two Scoops and satisfied yet again! I tried a few flavors and added a new one to my order - Batter Up!! Soooo delicious and preferred to me over Krazy Kake because while I love sweets, I don't actually care for cake and Krazy Kake is a lot of cake and sprinkles. Batter Up is its cake batter flavored cousin that is less \"extra\" and straight to the point: delicious. I also got Cookies By the Sea and Cookie Monster to go to enjoy this week. I can't wait to bring friends here and wow their taste buds too!  I want to note additional seating was available including more children's chairs and picnic tables are available outside as well!"}
{"text":"Our family was THRILLED to stumble onto this place- every cone was more delicious than the last.  I can't remember the flavors we all ordered, but I can tell you that we were all smiling happily afterward.  Fun flavors, friendly staff & delicious ice cream- it doesn't get better than that!"}
{"text":"OMG!!! The best ice creamery(is that a word?) YEA ice creamery that I've been to. They have I believe 40 different flavors annnnddddd they let you sample before you purchase!!!! How damn awesome is that??  Especially if you're greedy and have a sweet tooth like me and my family. The guy was so accommodating and nice I actually think I'm in love. But honestly GO there...run there...drive there!!!! JUST GO. HURRY UP"}
{"text":"Icecream is amazing!They have a variety of unique flavors to try.Sometimes it can get busy and the line can move slow."}
{"text":"Came here because it was a hot day and we wanted ice cream, saw great reviews for this place. It was bumping! It's a pretty small place and with limited seating and parking, there were a lot of people sitting on the front stoop eating their ice cream. It looked very kid friendly as there were special sized tables and chairs for kids though adults ended up using them. It wouldn't hurt for them to put in some more tables and chairs since it looked like they had some extra space.   The ice cream itself was ok, they have a lot of flavors, most of them custom. My bf and I got a total of four flavors a sugar cone and a waffle cone for $12. This is pretty steep but I guess the the scoops were big and they are in the middle of Charlotte? We got the vanilla heath, cookie monster, raspberry coconut, and mint and chocolate ice cream. My favorite was the vanilla heath, it had toffee and some nuts I think in it? The cookie monster flavor tasted just like it should, cookies! It was also bright blue and temporarily stains your lips haha. I did not like my raspberry coconut at all! The sourness of the raspberry combined really weirdly with the coconut and tasted almost a rotten kind of sour to me. My bf like it though so he ended up finishing it for me. The mint and chocolate was ok, pretty average.   The line was pretty long the whole time we were there and they have a sink if you're ok with tap water or want to wash your hands. The ice cream itself was just ok to me and we waited about ten min in line. Overall experience was pretty average for me but this is a good place for ice cream if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Really nice spot to get some homemade icecream , they have many flavors to choose from a various amounts of toppings as well  . I can't remember the icecream name I got , but it was something similar to butter pecan & OMGAHH it was delicious . They have a nice little spot outdoors where you can sit and eat icecream with a street view ! Prices are very affordable , got 2 double scoop ice cream waffle cones for $11 ! My only thing with this place is parking (unless) there was parking nearby that was bigger. But the parking lot is super tight with maybe 20 spaces maximum . Overall I liked this place , will be returning ."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get ice cream in clt! Seriously every flavor is delicious. You can't go wrong. And idk why you would waste your time with any toppings. The ice cream is literally perfect without it."}
{"text":"Tried it with the family and we loved it.  Creative flavors and yummy.  Nice staff too!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. They actually know how ice cream is supposed to taste, not too sweet and a little salty. It's become my favorite ice cream spot in charlotte and the guys that have been working when I stop in are very nice. #twoscoopsforlife"}
{"text":"Ice cream was ok and the service wasn't that great either. Maybe the workers were having a bad day. I may give them another shot down the road but for now I will stick to Elizabeth creamery, at least the owner there is a little more friendly."}
{"text":"Holy monkeys! I'm bananas for this place!  My fiancé went for a couple of cones tonight. I got two scoops, one of thin mint and one of chocolate covered pretzel, in a waffle cone. He got a scoop of peanut butter pretzel and one of chocolate covered pretzel also in a waffle cone. The total was a little pricey... Until I took the first bite.   The ice cream is real. It's made on location and you can really tell the difference. It's so light and fluffy and the massive two scoop I had never gave me a stomach ache. That's never happened before!"}
{"text":"I got the raspberry cheesecake, & beware one scoop is more than enough! The icecream was soo creamy and yummy! But I tried some of the Cookie Monster & IT WAS BOMB!! Love the fun blue color, & Must try!! They were so so busy, we didn't expect it to be so packed honestly. We had a really hard time finding parking because the lot was supper small, so a tip park across the street at White rabbit(: Really cute icecream shop, to hang out on a nice day & I love the wall art!"}
{"text":"Great ice cream that is homemade. Can really taste the different flavors and it really makes a difference."}
{"text":"We visited on an early Friday afternoon. It looked closed but it was not. Very open space when you walk in. It is a bit disorienting as the set-up inside is not what you would normally expect for an ice cream place. Kinda has a warehouse vibe.  There is a slew of ice cream options. I went with what I like- chocolate. Dark Chocolate is what was available and I requested a scoop on a cone. My husband had it on a waffle cone. Total came out to $8 and some change.  It was good. I was not blown away but I did enjoy devouring my scoop.   For those interested, you can submit an ice cream creation and name it for their consideration. A customer's idea was actually created and is now available for all to enjoy.  Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"When we first moved here we set out to try all the local ice cream spots -- because, ICE CREAM.  The walls are adorned with a very bright mural of ice cream - it's very artsy which fits for the area, Plaza Midwood. They have a regular menu and seasonal flavors! If you are lucky enough to stop in when TED is on the menu ... order it. It's vanilla and cinnamon swirl ice cream with teddy grahams - yum! Toasted coconut is great too.   The staff is always super patient and you can obviously taste flavors.  Parking can be tough during the summer due to limited parking and limited seating... but it's ice cream so people don't mingle too long.  Summer is coming so ensure you stop by... or anytime during the year because again, ICE CREAM."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim Thursday afternoon  because my friend was some craving ice cream and I have to say this place exceeded my expectation! The inside was really cute with lots of wall art.   All the ice cream flavors were unique and special. There weren't too many flavors where you would be overwhelm but just enough to have you wanting to try a few. I got one scoop of chocolate cookie cake and it was huge!!   My only complaint is that it's just a little bit hard to find and I almost missed the turn. But besides that I have no complaint with this little hole in the wall.   The service was fast and friendly and I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"I visited for the first time 2 weeks ago off pure luck. I had out of town family visiting and a lot of kids/preteens/teens/adults all requesting ice cream that's not from a big chain. One quick yelp search of the best ice cream near me and a 10 minute car ride later. Two Scoops is all they are still talking about. Nice flavors, soft ice cream and in a pretty cool spot. I was skeptical after trying to navigate the parking lot in a pickup but after trying the TED....it was worth the mini hassle. It was so good, my wife and I went back the following weekend to try another flavor. I would definitely recommend. If there's no parking, just park across the street (I didn't see any signs saying no parking)."}
{"text":"My wife and I are on an Ice Cream kick as of late and we have made it our mission to try some of the best Ice Cream places in Charlotte. A lot of them claim this title but not many live up to the name.   Two Scoops, however, lives up to this title for sure. You could tell the place was good by the size of the line when we got there late at night.   I got 2 scoops in a waffle cone. I had the Chocolate Raspberry and Mint Chocolate Chip. They were both awesome!! I will say though, I didn't taste much raspberry and would had preferred more of that or maybe a raspberry sauce in it. But it was delicious anyway! I can't wait to try more flavors."}
{"text":"I was excited for a new ice cream spot to open in this cool location...based on reviews and seeing pictures I had to give it a try! I first visited their website to see what kind of flavors they had. So many!! Right? Wrong. *FLAVORS: I got there expecting to see like 60 flavors they claim to have and they literally only have about 10 different flavors at a time. So you may want to call ahead to see which ones they have before you go. That was a big let down. *INSIDE: On a high note, major props on the wall painting inside. That was prob the best thing about the visit. *TASTE: I tried one of the cereal flavored ice creams, with captain crunch. Again I wanted to try the fruity pebble but they didn't have many options. It tasted just like I was afraid it would, like stale ice cream. Not sure why I thought it would be good but I was hoping it would be as good as it sounded. It wasn't. I'd recommend not getting one with cereal, unless soft stale cereal is your thing then go for it. *SERVICE: I came inside with my kid, while my fiancé and dog waited outside. So you do the math, that's needing 3 separate ice creams right? There was a line when we got inside but not terrible, we already came so I wasn't going to leave. When we finally got up to order, {you are allowed to try flavors} as many as you want? Idk. You'll get looks from the workers if you ask for more than 1-2. Again, my first time so I didn't know what I wanted exactly and bc well they didn't have all the flavors I originally planned on trying. I ordered something for my kid...and then was like I also need (trying to order something for me) and it was like he was annoyed I was still ordering. But like hey I'm not done. And before I can finish talking he will just walk off to go make it so by the time he brings me the second. I'm like I also need...(trying to order the 3rd for my fiancé who is patiently waiting outside). So dude looking very annoyed. So my first visit, they didn't seem very friendly. He was annoyed with me trying to order, and so after all that so was I. *PRICE: it's not cheap, kinda expensive...you could go anywhere for that price like Ben& jerry, the golden cow creamery, etc. They are local so I gave them a try. Glad I did but I won't be going back. My fiancé wasn't super impressed with his ice cream either, it was alright but not worth the price. *OPTIONS: There were no vegan flavors when we went, at one point they were advertising for that but like I mentioned under [flavors^] they only have a handful of flavors not all listed on their website."}
{"text":"Sorry Yelp... this one is going to be short.   It's ice cream, its very, very good.   Parking sucks when it's busy (you can get stuck in the parking lot from people blocking you in)... go anyways."}
{"text":"Ummm, ok so much for my diet!  Two Scoops is a new ice cream spot in Plaza Midwood.  The outside of the building isn't flashy and the inside just has a few tables.  Simple ambiance...unlike their ice cream.  I decided on the vanilla brownie chip ice cream.  I mean, really.  Ice cream can be that creamy?  It was pure goodness.  I could feel the calories just running through my body and I loved every minute of it.  I've also never seen a waffle bowl covered in chocolate and sprinkles on the inside, so I had to get it.  After a few bites, I started breaking off pieces of my waffle bowl and dipping it in the ice cream.  OH SO GOOD!!!  I tried a few other flavors before settling on the Vanilla Brownie one.  The cool thing about this place was the innovation.  The owner literally just created that flavor the night before to try something new.  They have a good variety of flavors, so something for everyone!  This place is perfect really for anyone.  There was a couple sitting in the corner, a dad with his kid sitting outside on one of the benches.  Now that I've discovered Two Scoops, I think I am going to look at getting a gym membership."}
{"text":"Ice cream is my weakness...correction GOOD ice cream is my weakness. And there's plenty of that at Two Scoops.  Love the variety of clever combinations and flavors ...and the cutesy names.  The Raspberry Cheesecake ice cream had massive chunks of real cheesecake in it and the Coffee tasted like it had real grains of ground beans in it. Both delicious but the Cheesecake took the prize!!  Just under $5 will get you two big ol' scoops nestled in a waffle cone.  Very cool décor = you can't miss the brightly colored mural reminiscent of Kenny Scharf! And they have their own parking lot.  Love that homemade ice cream shops are popping up everywhere! Good for business, bad for my waistline!"}
{"text":"Got to try this place through the Yelp CLTMade event series. Being so new to Charlotte, it's the perfect way to meet local businesses. Highly recommend this series!  We got to learn about MJ's story and how he got into the ice cream business. Trained by his uncle, all recipes are homemade on site. The ice cream chef Alexis also is bomb, pushing the 'scooper' on ice cream. Can't wait for their exciting new product to launch!  Ice Cream: They have seasonal flavors, but basically all flavors are made in a rotation, so you got to stop by and see what's up!  Got to taste 'Cookies by the Sea', 'Coffee Crunch' and 'Pumkin Pie'. I'm not a huge pumkin pie fan to begin with, I do have to say it tasted like a pumkin pie cheese cake- which is the extend I will go. Creamy churned ice cream, when you close your eyes just paints a picture of family thanksgiving. I love Oreos, I love salted caramel, so I ended up getting a scoop of 'Cookies by the Sea' because it just blends both worlds together and blows your mouth away.  They are open year round! Staff is super friendly. Watch out for the lines and parking is sparse! Gotta time it, but the wait is all worth it."}
{"text":"Ice cream yum. I likey. Eat ice cream here you no be disapoint. Yum yum for my tum tum."}
{"text":"This is an updated review from my prior post regarding the sharp edges of the spoons. I went today to get a waffle cone and picked up a spoon on the way out - they changed the spoons! They are now thicker and the edges are smooth. Thanks, guys!!"}
{"text":"Plaza Midwood needed ice cream and this is a good solid ice cream place. Not fancy, not over the top, just a good solid product. I was happy that the ice cream is not over-sweet and the chocolate flavors had a little bite to them. The ice cream is creamy and has great texture. They were kind of low on some flavors and their case was a little mixed up so I couldn't tell what was up when I stopped in on a Friday evening, but that's a growing pain that I'm sure they'll grow out of. Kinda laughing at the peeps who are complaining that they don't have lemon ricotta or whatever hipster upscale trend flavor you are looking for, if you want that go to the spendy gelato place in Park Road (which I also love, not judging). This seems like a good solid family ice cream place with variety that's not trying to be too trendy."}
{"text":"Best ice cream!  If you love chocolate, try the CHOCOLATE birthday cake ice cream. Chocolate ice cream with chocolate cake mixed in and sprinkles. Omg!  I need some now!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know how they could do much more with less!  Meaning that this place isn't going to give you the warm and fuzzies like those chain yogurt places. They just threw some paint on the walls, set up some ice cream coolers, and brought out perhaps the BEST homemade ice cream you've ever tried!  I tried a two scoop cup, consisting of the Bart and the Muddle!  The Bart was vanilla with Butterfingers mixed through, and Muddle was chocolate with Oreo and caramel mixed through it!  They could take all the mixers out and it's the solid base ice cream that still shines through and sells itself! My only advice, if you get anything chocolate, to consider getting something vanilla based to help combat the richness of their chocolate."}
{"text":"I just happen to walk by this place and quickly yelped it and decided to pop in.    The guy told me that all the ice cream was homemade in store.  I tried the Cookie Monster that everyone talked about and also the mint cookie, both were meh to me but when I sampled the coconut one, I knew I needed that one!  It was the perfect amount of coconut, not super overpowering and sweet and the ice cream was so creamy. It was a delightful little scoop!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this LOCAL creamery! All of the ice cream is home made and tastes delicious. Each time I go there is a new creative flavor to try. If you ever think of a flavor the don't have, then they welcome you to give suggestions. In addition to the variety of regular ice cream flavors, they also have Vegan ice cream and Vegan pastries. The paintings on the wall paired with the friendly staff make for a great atmosphere. This is one of the few ice cream places where I actually like to sit and eat inside.   So next time you are thinking about going to one of those ice cream chain shops, try supporting a local business instead.   GREAT ICE CREAM. GREAT STAFF. MUST GO!"}
{"text":"The first word that comes to my mind is WOW! Two Scoops is a cozy neighborhood ice cream shop located off of Central Avenue. They offer indoor and outdoor seating, the interior is decorated with some really cool graffiti like art. The ice cream tastes fresh, not overly sweet, and they have a vast variety. We tried the Berry Berry Sorbet, Rocky Road, and Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. They all were spectacular. The line was rather long but service was surprisingly fast and friendly. Definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"Yum. Had to try this place when I saw its grand opening was today. Great ice cream and nice people who run it. Maple walnut and double chocolate were awesome. Will definitely return. Welcome to Charlotte Two Scoops!"}
{"text":"There are so many places to eat ice cream but one I always hear about is Two Scoops Creamery! I came here one evening after picking up the little one from school. It was easy to spot and the whole the parking lot is small I was able to find a spot easily. I would imagine though it will probably be harder once the summer months come so be aware. The interior was beautiful. There were Ice cream cones and different designs painted all over the walls. The staff was friendly and inviting. You could try any flavor that you want. I opted for a waffle cone with two flavors. Cookie Monster on the bottom and Krazy Cake on the top. My son opted for a rainbow sorbet. I was so pleased. Neither flavor was over bearing and just the right amount of flavor and creaminess. If you are ever in the Charlotte area I would say this is a great place to stop by. Seating is limited though but it's a cool area so you wouldn't mind taking a stroll while you finish your ice cream. Summer is coming and I plan to be back!"}
{"text":"What a great, new spot for Plaza Midwood! While the ice cream was amazing -- I'll get to that in a minute -- my favorite thing about this place is how they preserved the character of the old, funky neighborhood. They could have made this place slick and shiny with stainless steel everything. Instead, their ice-cream is in big plastic tubs, colorful graffiti art covers the walls and signs inside are handwritten. If I didn't know better, I'd think Two Scoops had been serving ice-cream in the same spot for decades rather than having just opened. Thank you, thank you, thank you for respecting the history of Charlotte and \"feel\" of Plaza Midwood! In a time where it seems like everyone is tearing down to build bigger, newer, shinier... it's nice to find a place like Two Scoops.   So, now on the ice-cream. Oh, the ice-cream! I had toasted coconut and not your mom's pumpkin pie. Ted had the admiral's butterscotch. I almost never finish my ice-cream -- eyes bigger than my stomach situation -- but I ate every last drop of my cone from Two Scoops! Each flavor was delicious but my favorite, hands down, was that pumpkin pie. And, how exciting that you can get pumpkin flavor anything in August?!?  Fall is coooooming!! The pumpkin flavor was good and it had bits of graham crackers/cookies and caramel. It's already my favorite flavor ever.   Welcome to the neighborhood, Two Scoops! I'm looking forward to lots of hot Charlotte nights spent with your ice-cream!"}
{"text":"Great ice cream! A lot of unique flavors, with traditional tastes and toppings as well.  Definitely on Elizabeth creamery's level!  I went for the \"Captain Jack\" which is their vanilla and salted caramel! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Got to check out Two Scoops yesterday.  Pretty darn good!  I'm not sweets officianado, but I enjoy a scoop or three every once in a while.  The space is bigger than I thought and decorated with interesting murals on the walls.  My favorite were the cyclops ice cream scoops.  Next time I'm here, I need to ask if it was the same artist or different ones that created these murals.  I ultimately went with two scoops in a cup.  One Cookie Monster and one Boom scoop (Heath chocolate).  Don't let the blue color throw you, it threw me at first, but it is delicious.  The combination of cookie dough and Oreos is pretty perfect.  I actually wished I got two scoops of the Cookie Monster.  The Boom was also good, I just liked the Cookie Monster a tiny bit better.  Lots of outdoor picnic table seating.  The parking lot has spaces and this unique roundabout around a tree, but the spaces are a little tight.    Between people asking for samples, and the ice cream scooped to order... the line can form, but it's well worth the wait.  Employees are nice and the scoops are generous."}
{"text":"Stopped here with a few of my Yelp friends one night for dessert. It's a really cute ice cream shop. They have cute artwork on the walls that is worth investigating and taking a picture of.  But the best reason to come here is of course the ice cream. They have the usual Chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry flavors but they also have creative flavors like Cinnamon Toast Crunch, one named for the Simpsons called Bart (Butterfinger ice cream) and several other flavors.  I went with a waffle cone of a scoop of the Cinnamon Toast Crunch and a toffee bit ice cream that I forget the name of. Both were delicious but I especially enjoyed their use of the actual cereal in the Cinnamon Toast Crunch.  Around the place, they have a few high top tables for seating and a kids table which we saw a couple sitting at. There is also a patio outside.  Definitely worth the stop, especially since it's locally owned and the ice cream is made on site!"}
{"text":"this ice cream was FANTASTIC. you can tell that a lot of love goes into these ice cream flavors. we got the toasted coconut and the krazy cake. both delicious and creamy sweet treats. the scoops were huge for the price too, it was a great value. we can't wait to make this our weekly ice cream spot."}
{"text":"The ice cream itself is very good, but they have a bit to iron out in both service and the options they offer. First, they don't do sundaes, but rather toppings. It's a little strange - that distinction - for an ice cream shop, but that's what they told me. So even though they have (delicious) salted caramel sauce, you can't get a caramel sundae - just a bit on top. Also, the line can take a while when there are more than a couple of customers there, but they refuse call-in orders. So if you want to support a local business and quickly grab some ice cream for the kids on the way home you're out of luck. You'll need to be prepared to wait. The kids that work there are really nice, but in general just need some more training. The milk chocolate ice cream is out of this world."}
{"text":"Great local homemade ice cream shop with a super-friendly staff.  Of the 3 relatively new ice cream shops I've tried, Two Scoops is definitely the best. Elizabeth Creamery's ice cream had somewhat of a gummy texture and Golden Cow's was not as creamy as Two Scoops. Two Scoops also has the friendliest staff and atmosphere.  Two Scoops is the furthest drive for me, but I'll go the extra mile or two for the best."}
{"text":"Awesome ice cream & very friendly and fast service. Huge samples & even bigger actual scoops! We had toasted coconut and the coffee/Ted (teddy graham) combo which were both recommended and on point! Definitely will be coming back! The only improvement we can foresee is house made waffle cones. Too delish doe!"}
{"text":"There just really isn't enough ice cream in Charlotte. Weekend of warm weather calls for ice cream. They have some really cool flavors. I wanted to try something different but had to stick with the standby to make sure this place checks out-- mint chocolate chip. The ice cream is great! Boyfriend got the crunch dozer which has cinnamon toast crunch and our dog finished her vanilla scoop and begged for more. They have a couple of picnic tables outside, which is great."}
{"text":"New favorite place to have ice cream! Unique flavor combinations and great service. The kids liked the Krazy Kake with real pieces of cake and sprinkles, and Yabba Dabba Doo, with Captain crunch mixed in. Great homemade ice cream!"}
{"text":"Dear Two Scoops Creamery, thank you for helping to fill the cone shaped void of homemade ice cream options in this town.  This funky ice cream shop is owned and operated by three best friends. Christi K. and I stopped by this afternoon and had the pleasure of meeting one part of the trio, Marques- a lactose intolerant, vegan ice cream lover. Guys, I think he may be a unicorn. He's a really nice guy who learned how to make ice cream from ice family.   If you're looking for a place that scoops up everyday vanilla and chocolate, this isn't it. The homemade flavors are all so creative and unique. I went with two flavors today- a coffee ice cream packed with oreos and a chocolate ice cream with thin mint cookies. THIN.MINT.COOKIES. Sky's the limit here. They even had an ice cream with crunch berries. Five year old Nikki would want that every single day.   On top of delicious ice cream, the place is just adorable. The walls are covered with hand painted murals from a local artist. They also have a loyalty program, so be sure to sign up. I would give this place a bonus 6th star solely based on the fact that it's walkable and less than a half mile from my house. Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Very creative flavors they have to offer! Located right in plaza midwood. Makes for an easy dessert stop on the way back from any restaurant in the plaza area. Very family friendly."}
{"text":"Since our mom has been in the hospital for the past four months, my brother and I have been coping with almost daily trips for ice cream after spending the day with her. Two Scoops is the best. I already feel better walking into the store seeing the creative wall artwork and listening to the awesome upbeat background music. The interior is bright and colorful, everything meant to cheer up and brighten one's day. There's a mixture of indoor high top seating, little tot seating, and outdoor picnic tables with benches.  Don't be alarmed when you see a line, that's a good thing, and it moves pretty quickly. The flavors change out regularly, if not on a daily basis. Hence my justification to get two scoops rather than one in case the flavor I'm interested in trying may not be there the next time around. Ok, that only happened once and I barely finished it off since they are pretty big scoops! There's so many to pick from and I haven't been disappointed with any that I've tried so far. Lots of fun and tasty combinations that incorporate pop culture references, e.g. Bartman is a concoction of chocolate ice cream and chopped Butterfinger pieces in honor of Bart Simpson. One of my favorites is the Cookie Monster, a blue ice cream with cookie dough pieces, crushed Oreos, and crumbled Vanilla wafers capturing the essence of my favorite blue Sesame Street cookivore. So so good. Their milk chocolate ice cream is the milkiest and silkiest I've ever had so any of their chocolate ice cream based flavors are excellent (Muddle has Oreos and salted caramel while the Chocolate Krazy Kake has chocolate cake pieces and confetti). I really enjoyed the Thin Mint Crunch which is a mint ice cream with thin mint pieces as well as the Cookies By the Sea, which has salted caramel with Oreos.  Staff are friendly and patient with people who are deciding what to order. Also thankfully nonjudgmental when we keep coming back regularly in frequent intervals...sometimes in stretchy pants. I skip the sampling since any flavor I get is guaranteed to be great."}
{"text":"My kids loved the cookie monster ice cream!  Great atmosphere, delicious ice cream.  What more is there to say?"}
{"text":"Two Scoops is by far my favorite ice cream place in Charlotte, and I LOVE ice cream!  I love their unique flavors, as well as their more traditional flavors.  It's all homemade and delicious! And of course, you have to get 2 scoops when you go to Two Scoops!  I recommend getting two different flavors, as well!"}
{"text":"Delicious homemade creamy ice cream! 100% recommend the coffee!!! Cute little shop perfect when it is warmer out!"}
{"text":"Why it took Charlotte so long to get into the artisan ice cream scene still baffles me. However, I'm glad 2 scoops exist. The space is huge, both indoors and outdoors and have awesome wall art throughout the shop. Oh, their ice cream is also really good. What is there not to love?  I've been in a few times and been able to sample quite a few flavors. In general, their ice cream is super creamy and sweet (maybe a bit too sweet but that's fine with me). The Dabba doo must be my favorite flavor; it's fruity pebbles with a sweetened ice cream base.  I'm excited to see what new flavors they will come out with and will definitely be returning on my future visits back to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"The crazy cake was one of the best ice cream flavors I've ever had. The salted caramel was also amazing. I brought 2 friends and they were going crazy about how good the ice cream is here. And the staff are GREAT. This place rocks!"}
{"text":"Awesome!! Took my wife here today and it was packed!!  The ice team was out of this world!! What we had:  Chocolate Carmel Chip Cookie Monster Chocolate peanut butter  Strawberry   All equally delicious! Good luck to the owner/owners. I plan to be back."}
{"text":"Ice cream is delicious. Staff is amazingly friendly. Couldn't ask for more! Will be back to enjoy more ice cream :)"}
{"text":"Big fan. Good quality and price. The flavors are fun and more non-traditional. Definitely worth the trip if you like good icecream with fun flavors."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a local icecream joint these days. Two scoops is definitely that though. End to a perfect date night and the icecream is delicious, the staff is so friendly and there is little better in this world than sitting outside on a July night with the breeze at a picnic table."}
{"text":"A tiny little shop on the corner that you would miss if you were going to fast or not paying attention.  I came on a weeknight and it was about 8 PM, so they were of course, out of some items.  There was a long line to the front door of people anxiously awaiting an ice cream treat.  They have several lactose free items, which caught my eye and was refreshing to see.    The shop is neat and clean.  There is a cool painting on the back wall and some seating both indoors and out.  The staff is extremely helpful and extremely friendly.  I couldn't have asked for a better customer service experience.    I had the chocolate PB and a waffle cone-delicious!  The cones tasted especially wonderful and fresh.  I can't wait to stop back!"}
{"text":"Genuinely good, homemade ice cream.   Finally stopped by to check this place out when a friend visiting said, \"I want ice cream\". We have had two scoops on our radar, but never turned in, and that certainly changed after this visit! This ice cream was deliciously creamy, but also light and airy, which to me, was the perfect balance. They also let you sample before you commit, which is great because there are so many delicious flavors. I highly recommend the cheesecake, which seemed to be a group favorite, followed by the Heath coffe one. They also have some seasonal flavors like Apple cider and pumpkin pie.   If you're craving ice cream, this is not a spot to miss. You'll be happy you stopped in!"}
{"text":"This is a favorite of both Joey and I. Any time we are going out for dessert this is our go to. We went last night just before closing after date night to grab a scoop or two. Joey always gets their chocolate which he says is the best chocolate ice cream ever. I pretend I'm going to try something new and then get the Cookie Monster. Yes it has a cool name and yes it's blue and packed with a variety of your cookie favorites. This time I even convinced Joey to buy me a pint to go!"}
{"text":"Pros: Great unique flavors.. get the Cookie Monster! Fun spot.   Cons: Not a lot of outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this ice cream twice. The Maple Pecan, Vanilla Fudge Brownie, and Praline were very good. Prices are fair considering the clear amount of work that goes into each batch - saw the owner mixing a new batch as we were leaving. Nice staff. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing! I moved to Charlotte and have been here three out of the last four days. Oops!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I never went to this place in the two years I've lived in Plaza Midwood.  After seeing all the yummy ice cream social media posts for National Ice Cream Day, I had to get a cone myself.  Initially, I was undecided between Elizabeth creamery and Two Scoops, but after a friend's recommendation...I settled on this place.  The inside has a wall with cool trippy murals that will keep your eyes busy while waiting in line.  The seating area is not large but you do have huge picnic tables you can sit at outside.  Parking is not the best but this place is worth the walk if you have to go down the street to park. I ordered the strawberry cheesecake and double chocolate in a waffle cup. What an awesome combo!  Service was good and very helpful. I do wish they had offered some suggestions on pairing but still hands down...best ice cream I've had in a few years! Two Scoops for the win!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so amazing. The owner is super friendly, and the flavors are all unique and delicious. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I tried Two Scoops after hearing great things about it, but I must say I was not impressed. The parking situation is tight, the line moves pretty slowly, and the 2 flavors I tried were not very good.   I had the Oreo flavor and it was subpar - I much prefer Golden Cow's Salted Oreo. My fiancé had a chocolate cone and he wasn't a fan of his either. Their flavors are pretty simplistic, and their ice creamy lacks the creaminess that I love from other local ice cream shops.  I will stick to Golden Cow!!"}
{"text":"Took awhile to try as it seemed a little too \"hip\" for me, but I work in the neighbor and drive past everyday so today was the day to stop. Wish I'd checked it out earlier as the ice cream was great....definitly not the fair you get at many ice cream stands where it all tastes the same. Cookies by the Sea was my fav, but the boss(my daughter) thought Cookie Monster was the bomb"}
{"text":"Tried twice now to go but parking sucks. People just eat in there car. I will change review when I can park."}
{"text":"I got a double scoop, because... how can you not at \"Two Scoops.\" Well done, my friends on convincing me to go the extra mile and indulge a little bit. The staff were PHENOMENAL, and like Crystal H. noted, they were eager to let us sample and make an educated decision on which flavors we had to have. All their ice cream is made in house- you can watch it being made from the outside window. I was a sucker for the Cookie Monster and as the name indicates, I had to have a dip of \"you complete me.\"  The scoops were more than generous, and what I loved most was that they packed the ice cream down to the bottom of the cone."}
{"text":"Two Scoops is gaining popularity fast. It's not that old and probably the first place you will hear about when pairing ice cream and Charlotte together in a sentence. They have even been expanding to other stores so keep your eyes peeled!   They have great homemade ice cream with lots of different flavors. Lots of custom creations that change frequently so pay attention to their social media pages. The most notable thing to get is the two scoop cone which doesn't stack vertically but side by side. Makes getting two different flavors super easy and also visually appealing.   The store on Central is pretty large for an ice cream shop but two scoops stays busy! They even have small children's tables which are pretty cute. The walls are decorated with cool local ice cream art. The staff are high energy and ready to help. Don't hesitate to ask any questions or try a sample!"}
{"text":"I'm so excited that Charlotte finally has some unique ice cream shops. This place has very unique and absolutely delicious flavors. We've had Strawberry Cheesecake, Raspberry Cheesecake, TED, and a Cinnamon Toast Crunch one. I've loved everything I've tried so far."}
{"text":"I feel like my whole life was complete after eating ice cream here!  So. Friggin'. Good. I said that so many times while eating the ice cream my fiance said, \"Ok, I get it.\"  He got tired of hearing me say it, but I just couldn't stop saying it.   This place is simple. Damn good ice cream and that's it.   I had the toasted coconut and the Ted (cinnamon teddy grahams with a cinnamon swirl). Both were delicious, but the Ted was outstanding.  They even have a customer suggestion box, and several of the flavors there that evening were suggestions by customers. How cool!!!  We drove across town to have ice cream here, and it was so worth it."}
{"text":"Two scoops is such a cute little spot! I am grateful that they have a creative mind and also have not forgotten that vegans/lactose intolerant individuals want ice cream, too! We came in later on a weekend night and it was fairly calm. The people working at the counter were so very sweet and apologized as they informed us they had a freezer malfunction and some of the ice creams were out because they did not survive the freezer issue. It was not a problem, though, there were still many options to choose from.  It is cute, clean, has fun vibes and friendly staff who are loving what they're doing."}
{"text":"Good ice cream but real talk...why have dog ice cream but aren't dog friendly?! Princess Stella wasn't happy"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as I sit here and eat my ice cream because ITS THAT GOOD. Holy Lord. Thank you Two Scoops Creamery for being a thing because you've changed my life. Everyone needs to go here immediately. Try Ted, Cereal Killer, and Cookie Monster. Thank me later. Ps. The staff rocks too."}
{"text":"Great homemade ice cream and nice outdoor seating. Regular prices. Above average ice cream and a good amount too. Lots of flavors and a cool atmosphere"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I arrived here after dinner on Saturday night, and they were down to about 10 flavors. Holy cow, people must've gone crazy for this stuff!!  The location is wonderful, just a block down from Intermezzo. I was with my mom and she saw the sign out front and asked \"wait, this place is new? that sign looks old..\" and honestly, I think that's kind of what they were going for. Completely old fashioned, nothing 'new' or 'fancy' about this place. It's what Ice Cream should be.  When we arrived there was a pretty long line (we were backed up to the door), but it moved fast! Unfortunately, up on their chalk(ish) board, they had erased a majority of flavors and had about 10 left. That kind of speaks to how much variety they had to start out with though.   I chose to get the maple walnut in a waffle cone, and parents both got peppermint. The ice cream was good, I'm looking forward to experiencing more creativity in flavors when I return. They were also running low, so I can't judge based off of that. I will definitely be updating this review *when* I return."}
{"text":"Heard it is a great ice cream place and tried it. Wanted try pistachio flavor but it was not available on the day. Tried salted caramel, butter pecan and strawberry cheesecake in a waffle corn. It is sooooo tasty. Really liked salted caramel and butter pecan. It was rich enough but not too much buttery or creamy to finish them all. Usually it is not easy to finish the ice cream if it has too heavy taste. Their ice cream is so tasty and rich flavor! Will try different flavors next time!"}
{"text":"Two Scoops...I've waited so long to try you! I'm not even a huge ice cream person but you had me at first bite. I had the Papi crunch and it was SO GOOD. Who would have thought captain crunch ice cream would be like crack?  The shop is cute, not a ton of seating. The parking lot is small. Lunchbox records is almost next door so ice cream and record browsing would make a fun summer date!"}
{"text":"Oh, so yummy! There were three of us tonight so we had to order 3 different flavors and be nice and share. We ordered thin mint crunch, raspberry cheesecake, and Bartman. Of course each flavor had to come in a waffle cone as well! We pretty much fought over the flavors. Really really good ice cream. It has a rich flavor and I just wish that there was a location closer to me!"}
{"text":"Stopped by midday. It wasn't crowded. I was excited to find a dark chocolate mint & Oreo vegan ice cream, sweetened with agave (eaten in a waffle cone but still, the ice cream!). The texture wasn't creamy but it had a great flavor.  I can't remember what Dan had but he liked it.  There was a pretty good selection. The gal mentioned something about ice cream on vegan donuts but they were not available on our visit, maybe only on weekends."}
{"text":"Delicious ice cream, but it seems like they are ALWAYS sold out of all the good the flavors!"}
{"text":"Such a cute little homemade ice cream parlor in Charlotte. They have awesome artwork and really nice staff. They have a lot of unique flavors I tried a few and they were all great - Cookie Monster, Heath, Pralines and Cream, and Captain Jack. I ended up going with the Cookie Monster and I was really happy with my choice. Seems like everyone else in my group was happy with their scoops too :)"}
{"text":"We were exploring Charlotte and decided to get ice cream so I looked up some reviews and decided to come to two scoops. So glad I did. I got the Bart which was vanilla with butterfinger. OMG sooo good! Hubby can't remember the exact name of his, but it was chocolate with Oreos which he thought was good too. They have a ton of other unique flavors I'd love to try sometime."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite homemade icecream spots in town! Its overflowing with flavor and they stuff it with the additions! Oreo icecream...you wont have any trouble finding the oreos. Heath..same. Fruity pebbles.. Youll find tons of pebbles!  They are so helpful helping you choose flavors and the shop is so cute. You can even rent the space!! Hoe fun would that be! The cool double scoop cone is a cute different way to enjoy two scoops!! There were 3 of us..all with 6 different flavors and we cant wait to go back! A great summer spot for the family!"}
{"text":"Whimsically artisan and delicious-- make a stop here now.  I don't want to write anything more than that because words will never paint the picture of how magical this ice cream truly is. Go now, and find out for yourself, why I simply cannot tell you more."}
{"text":"After several visits to Two Scoops Creamery, last night's visit took the cake, literally. \"Batter Up\" could be my new favorite flavor, a Vanilla based Ice Cream with Cake Batter, OMG!   Two Scoops offers a wide variety of flavors, which can be served on a cone or in a cup. With all the variety/unique flavors be sure to sample, but I honestly don't think you can go wrong. I am a true \"Vanilla\" Ice Cream fan, and theirs is rich in Vanilla flavor. A cute shop with several tables and a TV inside, this funky looking Creamery is a great afternoon stop or even a treat after dinner."}
{"text":"Love Two Scoops ! One of my fave ice cream spots in CLT ! My boyfriend had a coconut and I had chocolate chip it was sooo good plus what cute name !"}
{"text":"Great ice cream! And they try to fill u up with big tasters. Then give u a huge scoop! I left them choose my flavor cuz I was being indecisive. And the guy picked the best one. The Heath ;)"}
{"text":"I really hope to update this review soon, because I want to like this place so much! My husband and i came back for a third time (first two times we came, all of the flavors were \"out\" and the line was out the door-- BUT i will say, i know they had a rough first few days, so i don't hold that against them!)... When we were finally able to get some 'scream, it just seemed average. Especially considering the prices. The flavors weren't very inventive (sure \"cookie monster\" is a cool name, but i'd love to see chunky pistachio, bourbon caramel, lemon ricotta, etc... flavors that really pique our interest!), and the ice cream flavors my husband and I got were just okay. (Granted, we only had like 6 flavors to pick from)  They should wipe-away the flavor names on their black board and off the glass-freezer windows when they are out. It makes ordering really confusing and stressful, especially when there's so many people in line.   hopefully these are just a few kinks that the owner will work out in time! (including maybe lowering prices! yikes)"}
{"text":"For me two scoops is just ok. I like their large selection of flavors but my main suggestion is that you try what you are getting because I find a lot of their flavors have a freezer burnt taste to them. It has a nice set up and plenty of room to enjoy your ice cream which is nice. And even more importantly good parking which is hard to find in Plaza Midwood. Last night they did go from being a two star to a three star for their coffee crunch flavor which is coffee ice cream with Oreos in it which was very good. I also have to say their prices are good and they have one double scoop cone where the cone lets you enjoy two flavors next to each other instead of on top of each other:)"}
{"text":"LOVED two scoops! First, I walked there from Legion because I was really craving GOOD ice cream. After a lovely walk down Central, I found myself at Two Scoops. One thing I noticed immediately was all the artwork inside. It's quite colorful and I loved it. I was immediately greeted by a staff member who politely asked how she could help me. I looked at all the flavors and was having a hard time deciding. I told her I love chocolate and cookies and asked for a recommendation. She promptly grabbed several tasting spoons and proceeded to allow me to sample many many flavors, including the vegan cookies and cream -- surprisingly delicious!  I went with the blue Cookie Monster ice cream. It's vanilla with lots of homemade, fresh cookies smashed in. To say that it \"hit the spot\" is an understatement. I got a waffle cone too, which was fresh and yummy.   Overall, my experience was excellent because I got great customer service and an awesome ice cream. I will definitely be back to Two Scoops soon!"}
{"text":"We used to really like coming here, but lately the flavors have been pretty boring. They no long have inventive flavors or vegan options (other than sorbet). Hopefully they will bring back whoever was making all the crazy creations we used to love."}
{"text":"Yum! What a deliciously sweet little shop. Love the yelp check in deal, love their flavors, love how one scoop is just huge.   What's not to love!? Answer: the parking.   If you can find a spot, grab it and never let it go. Come in and enjoy some delicious ice cream. It's always clean, the service is friendly, and there is plenty of seating!"}
{"text":"Love this place. GREAT ice cream with flavors my kids are always excited about. The service is always friendly. Thanks for setting up in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"There's something to be said for keeping things simple and doing it WELL. There's no hiding behind wacky combinations or trendy ingredients - Two Scoops' flavors carry themselves amazingly well without feeling the need to overcomplicate things. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Some of the best ice-cream I've ever had. Very clean and cool space, great service. A must try."}
{"text":"YAY!!! Finally an amazing ice cream shop in Charlotte...I had the vanilla heath...it was absolutely fantastic...My friend had the strawberry and toasted coconut....to my surprise I even liked hers.  If you love ice cream this is a must try...it just may become a regular spot...I know it will be one of mine..."}
{"text":"This place is incredibly addicting! My favorite flavor is Muddle: chocolate ice cream with caramel and Oreos, it's life-changing!  Unfortunately they ran out one night but let me know they could make a suitable replacement by adding caramel to the chocolate and Oreo ice cream. Sounds great in theory, but my server added a peanut butter sauce instead... thank goodness I'm not allergic to peanut butter, but I don't like the taste at all and it tainted the rest of the ice cream. :(  But clearly I've put that night behind me and continue to frequent the creamery, it's addicting! I just make sure to keep the delicious ice cream topping-less, it doesn't need any additions."}
{"text":"Move that Dough baking company hosts vegan brunches on the weekend's along with a few other stars of vegan cooking. This review is both a review of those brunches and Two Scoops delicious ice cream during the regular hours as well, as I have been lucky enough to have experience eating both!  Starting with the location. Two Scoops is a fun, playful atmosphere, with a a seating area indoors enough to probably fit 20-25 at most. There is additional seating outside with cute benches, although I think this will be much more useful in the summer months. They have a kids table that is precious and that I have sat at myself, but have also seen little ones enjoying with their scoops. The facilities are always clean, well lit, and open and with the colorful murals, you definitely don't miss the \"ice cream shop\" vibe.   Moving on to the brunches. Wow. I have followed Move that Dough for probably about a year and a half now, enthusiastically watching her social media as she hops from pop up event to pop event. Her products have always been high quality and delicious. Since she began to root at Two Scoops, she is still consistently making delicious and high quality products, but has expanded from just donuts (her initial speciality and still incredible) to other ambitions such as house made yeast buns, mouthwatering biscuits, yeasted donuts, cinnamon rolls and the list goes on. She is an expert in crafting both savory and sweet treats that don't overwhelm, but always deliver. Whenever I have one of her treats, I feel like I'm eating the comfort food my mom never made. I've tried such an array of her baked goods, it's a little embarrassing (blueberry cinnamon roll, pumpkin sweet roll, biscuits, yeast buns, lemon blueberry donuts, peanut butter fudge donuts, to say a few) and they are all just as good as the one before. The other chefs at the vegan brunch also always deliver, offering more savory options to the already huge spread. They are a sweet crew, going above and beyond and always full of light and energy. I have enjoyed ever time I have come out for a good cause and a good brunch.  Two Scoops ice cream is also incredible and their staff is just as lovely and light during normal working hours. They have always been willing to answer my questions, joke about whatever may be happening in the world or in the shop, and recommend amazing flavors. Just in general, the quality of this ice cream sings through by itself. It is creamy, full of amazing chunks, and lends itself well to pairing with flavors around it. I, and the numerous friends I bring to this place, have always walked away very, very, happy.  Two Scoops is definitely a Charlotte gem. Come out for Move that Dough's delicious brunches, then come right on back for a scoop later that evening. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"About time this town starts getting some more homemade ice cream options! Ice cream is very yummy and just under $4 for a single scoop. The flavors were more unique than your standard flavors, but no so much where they were \"weird.\" For example, some options include pumpkin pie. peppermint and chocolate covered pretzel.  Only reason I am docking a star is because the interior is pretty cold and stark (for now - sounds like the interior decor is still in the works tho). However, there are a few benches and seats outdoor as well. However, I would not say this factor would deter me from delicious ice cream.  Welcome to town Two Scoops! I have been long awaiting you."}
{"text":"This Place gets an added star because I've been back 2 more times and it's always delicious and the guys behind the counter are friendly even when it's PACKED. Line moves pretty quickly and it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Went at 9:30pm and the place was closed.  Please update Yelp with your correct hours."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Get the Cookie Monster! Only complaint is the tables out front don't have any shade, would be nice to put some umbrellas out there!"}
