{"text":"Main did not come until an hour after we sat down (40 min after our appetizer). When we inquired, the waiter simply said, \"oh I didn't place your order til after you were done your appetizers. If you wanted to have it right away, you should've told me!\" Table next to us (who started ordering at the same time as us) were already eating desert by the time our main arrived. I assume they informed the waiter of their busy schedule that didn't include spending forever at a restaurant?

Not sure since when wait staff assumed that people want to stay at a restaurant for 3 hours. Did not want desert. Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"Great service , wonderful food. 
Plating well presented. 
Every dish explained and tasty. 
Def will go back :)"}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in a long time. Wow. Still thinking about it two days later."}
{"text":"A good spot for sit down casual dinning around Eaton centre. The chef's table, open to the kitchen seems be kept free for walk-in, even during lunch rush hours, that's where we sat. High recommend the changeable set menu, with app, entree & desert @ $21. Food was delicious and the service was really personable."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came for Saturday Roast, a burger and a dessert. The Saturday Roast was a delicious and traditional roast beef meal. The burger exceeded expectations, and will go down as one of the best burgers I have ever had. The burger was cut in half, which made it easy to share. The rosemary fries that came with the burger were amazing. Their dessert special was a cinnamon bun with a variety of fixings, and overall it was very thoughtful and well executed. The service met expectations."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and it's the best bang for your buck! Service was great and cooks were friendly. 

Try the chef's menu (8-course meal for $66pp) and be sure to mention it when you're making reservations as this event will take about 2 hrs.

I've recommended it to a few friends and they also enjoyed the food. Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"Are here because of all the good reviews & high ratings.  Must admit I was a bit underwhelmed. I feel menu prices are high for what it is.   Probably because of the \"celebrity chef\". Also service was a bit rushed. We had an 8:45 reservation and no one was waiting when we left so there was no reason to rush us. We sat in the back up the stairs & could see the open kitchen which was neat. It's loud & crowded so don't plan an intimate or romantic night there.  Overall good food but there are better places in Toronto."}
{"text":"This restaurant RATES THEIR CUSTOMERS! 

I made a reservation for a party of 10, five weeks in advance for a double birthday party, only to arrive to find out that our reservation was never booked. We were left standing there stunned. Then I saw on their ipad in RED under my name and contact, \"don't do any favors for this customer, don't book her reservation.\" 

I actually did nothing to this restaurant but recommend it to my friends.  I had to reschedule a reservation, but they had a cancellation error and then blamed me for not showing up. Then they gave away my rescheduled reservation without telling me so I still showed up with my party of 10 with no place to sit.

I really meant no harm to this restaurant, but no one deserves to be treated this way. No customer wants to be rated!  

Their food is good 3.5/5, with desserts and appetizers as their strengths. I ate here before this event so I had the chance to sample many items from a previous large dinner. If you enjoy dining out and following yelp, foodspotting, and the food network like myself, this spot is average and their customer service isn't friendly. This restaurant is no big deal."}
{"text":"Went to Richmond Station with some girlfriends in June. I was really excited to try it out as I had heard good things about the restaurant, and more importantly I was a huge fan of Carl Heinrich on Top Chef Canada!

The waitress was very helpful in assisting us with the wine menu, she even brought us a couple of tastes to help us decide! We ended up with a delicious and well priced Sauvignon Blanc which complimented our food very well. 

The food I thought was a bit over priced, hence the 4/5 stars. I had the Station burger which Carl is said to have brought over from Marben when he worked there. The burger was basically perfect, medium rare with a soft and not-too-big milk bun. I was very pleased that they accommodated my picky side and gave me half fries half salad as well (PS why don't more restaurants offer this straight up?)

One of my friends got 2 salads as her main, a nice option but she left feeling hungry. I will be back as there are some other items I would love to try. As far as execution and service goes, they were spot on."}
{"text":"We had the Chefs tasting menu and it did not disappoint! It's hard to pin down the highlights but the oysters stuck out as being extra fresh and juicy, the scallops were perfectly cooked and accompanied with delicious scraps of bacon & onion.  The striploin with brown butter hollandaise melted in the mouth and the burger was the perfect complement of flavours.  Overall there were 9 delicious courses for a VERY reasonable price of $65!  We left completely stuffed.  The wine list is OK too with some very good values.  
The review wouldn't be complete without mentioning the great service...our waitress was smart, funny, knowledgeable and accommodating.  
Absolutely recommend this awesome restaurant!"}
{"text":"Wow, I must say, I am impressed. I rave about this to all my friends and family. This is the kind of place you would take someone special (and one who doesn't mind small but decadent portions). The food is a bit on the pricey side; expect to pay around $100+ for dinner for 2 with an appetizer, main course, dessert, and wine. This is not the kind of restaurant you go to if you are starving. The portions are fairly small, but the dishes are so mesmerisingly flavorful. I ordered an asparagus dish for an appetizer (don't ask why) and it was beyond what I expected. I don't even know what they did to the asparagus but it was heavenly. I'm talking about TWO STRIPS OF ASPARAGUS !! Anyway, I ordered the rabbit for the main course and it is to die for. The vegetables were so excellently prepared. I don't know any other restaurant that can make vegetables taste that good. Overall the food is a 5/5, service is a 5/5 (saw no problems) and the atmosphere was a 4/5. Not so amazing compared to the food as the place is a bit small and I am the kind of person who prefers a good amount of separation from other tables. Nonetheless, I would recommend coming here and trying the food if you're into fusion cuisine and fancy-looking dishes you always see on food network but never knew where to get it."}
{"text":"Meh and a bit pretentious. Not a great ambiance in the bar. Food was good although using soybean  oil as a bread dip was odd. The bread was excellent. Service was ok but not great."}
{"text":"Beautifully done modern cuisine. If you can venture out away from the polenta fries and safer options you will be pleasantly surprised to find delicately creative culinary dishes. I don't go back to reataurants often when I travel, but I will be back for certain. *Ask for the chef's seating, it will make you appreciate the detail behind each dish!"}
{"text":"Best food in Toronto, bar none. It was insanely good."}
{"text":"There seems to be a certain stigma surrounding restaurants in the financial district. I didn't think to try this place out until several of my friends expressed their interest - and I can see what the rave is all about.

POLENTA FRIES - spicy mayonnaise, marinara, cilantro - These fries were amazing! Tastes a lot healthier than potato fries and several of us noted that it reminds us of cornbread. Highly recommend.
ROASTED BEETS - maple vinaigrette, goat cheese, arugula, hazelnuts - Beets are one of my absolute favourite foods, and Richmond Station cooks them just right.
STN. BURGER - aged cheddar, beet chutney, rosemary fries, radish salad - Their burger is done medium-rare, just the way I like it. This burger is definitely up there by Toronto standards.
BEEF DUO - one of their specials comprised of beef shank and steak - Personally, I liked this better than the burger. The meat is quite tender and very tasty! However, would have preferred a steak knife (over the butter knife) to be able to cut the meat..."}
{"text":"After Dundas and Queen station, there is Richmond Station. Just steps away from Toronto's Eaton centre and located right beside Richmond Street (hence the name of the restaurant), Richmond Station is opened by the notorious winner of Top Chef Canada Season 2, Carl Heinrich, who took his winnings and spent it on a casual fine dining restaurant. While it may not seem like a big restaurant from the outside, inside there are two dining rooms. The one in the front is long and narrow with high ceilings and open bar seatings. The one in the back is cozy and romantic with an open kitchen where you can see the chefs flipping and stirring away.

Due to the last minute spontaneous decision, we were unable to reserve a table at the back. As a matter of fact we went without any reservations so when we got there we were asked to wait 20 minutes in the front at the wooden bar counter where we got to order cocktails and browse the menu. In addition to the limited offerings on their menu, daily specials were written on a chalkboard.

After what seemed like a short wait, we were seated in the front room at the bar. Faced with a wall with wooden accent furnishing filled with different types of wine and a cute bartender mixing drinks, the vibe was classy and friendly.

We started off our dinner with a plate of charcuterie. It came with five different types of cured meat complemented with bread and a balsamic olive oil dip. I can't exactly recall the kinds of meat that were served because as the waitress was explaining, my mind was already savouring the delicious cuts of meat. The cured meat each had their own distinctive salty and smokey flavourings and subtle textures.The bread was warm and soft with a great crust and the balsamic dip had just the right amount of sweet and tartness to it. In fact, the bread was so good, we couldn't resist to order seconds. Luckily they were complimentary.

Next came the entrees. I ordered the grilled swordfish that laid atop a bed of chick pea fricasee, semi-grilled cherry tomatoes, peas, cajun mixed with avocado cream sauce sprinkled with some cilantro. Initially, I was a little disappointed by the small plate size as I equated smaller plates with smaller portions. However, after I started digging into my main, I realized there was more than enough food to be consumed. The fish was perfectly charred, the sauce was super creamy, and the cherry tomatoes gave it a perfect pop of natural sweetness. The flavour profile of this dish was absolutely exquisite.

We finished the meal off with complimentary spiced fudge. The rich bitterness of the chocolate with a last minute pop of spiciness made this trip certainly memorable."}
{"text":"Right before flying back home to San Fran from Toronto today, we had the best food experience of our trip. We were impressed when we first ate here a few days ago and decided to come back for another weekday lunch. Our second visit, today, was even better than the first.

The chefs at Richmond Station do a beautiful job of layering flavors and balancing tastes in the dishes they create. Our favorites from both visits: Sourdough Crusted Euro Bass, Braised Beef Ravioli, and (today's special) Green Curry.

Karen, our server, made the experience particularly fun. She chatted with us about food and was very friendly. On the first visit, she shared a printed list made by the staff of other local favorite restaurants and talked with us about her favorites too. On our second visit, after seeing how much we loved the restaurant, she even surprised us with a maple semifreddo and a piece of delicious chocolate with the check. What a thoughtful treat!

We ate at other top Toronto restaurants while on our trip but this was by far our favorite. In fact, this restaurant would fit right in with our favorites back home in San Francisco. We can't wait to go back to Richmond Station on our next visit to Toronto!"}
{"text":"I've had lunch at Richmond Station twice. Fantastic both times. I'd love to have dinner here, too, but it's difficult to make a reservation. They're always booked up. Understandably. I'll keep on trying..."}
{"text":"kick ass cocktails, friendly servers, great atmosphere, soon going back to check out the food."}
{"text":"I walked in with my wife on a Friday night and sat at the bar.  We ordered four items to share and they were all delicious.  Polenta fries, fresh pecorino cheese, gnocchi and their burger.  I know I just wrote that Holy Chuck was the best burger in the city, but this place is right up there.  I think I was just so surprised at how good the Holy Chuck burger was, and if I am dropping $20 on a burger I just expect it to be great, which it was.  Our server was fantastic and there were definitely other things on the menu that I want to try.  You can also have them cook for you for $50 per person, which I may do next time.

Overall a very pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Came to Richmond Station for a business dinner on a Tuesday evening based on rave reviews here and elsewhere.  I like the atmosphere of the place, buzzing and hopping.  A bonus is to have an underground parking right beside it, although the location just opposite The Bay is not very \"happening\" (kind of dead actually).  My beat salad starter was good, but not exceptional.  The famed polenta fries lacked taste and frankly the polenta didn't come through at all.  I chose braised beef ravioli as my main, which looked ambitious on the plate, yet didn't brim with the taste and fragrance you'd expect.  And what was that raw egg on top of the ravioli?  That felt very 80's and completely unnecessary.  I tried my partners Perogi, and same story:  they looked good but lacked flavour.  The meal came to $160 for two including tip.  Service was good, but I cannot understand the rave reviews this place gets, and it's not cheap to boot.  Big disappointment, will not go back."}
{"text":"hands down, best food I have tasted in a while. Miraculous service. GO THERE!  Can go there dressed up or casual, very versatile. Love the atmosphere, and how we get to watch the chefs do their magic behind the chef's bar."}
{"text":"Always a great meal and service; I've been multiple times, and it never disappoints. The burger is one of the best in the city, but the two-way rabbit is always excellent. The front area of the restaurant can be a bit loud, but just ask to be seated in the raised area in the back of the place."}
{"text":"(3.5 stars to be exact.)

My friends and I learned about Richmond Station when we came across 10Best's list of top restaurants in Toronto. It wasn't until I visited the restaurant's website did I find out their executive chef is Carl Heinrich, who won Top Chef Canada (season two). We made sure to have made a reservation despite dining on a Thursday night.

The four of us walked to the restaurant from our workplace, and two of us actually walked right by it because the storefront is quite subtle. The restaurant inside is simple and modern. Dining here felt very comfy and cozy, despite the dimmed lighting and the well-dressed servers.

My friend ordered Rabbit and Crackers for the table. I have never tried rabbit and I do not ever intend to, but she said the appetizer was all right.

While deciding on my main, I realized there are only a handful of dishes I would actually want to order. A lot of reviews mentioned their Scallop special, and I was hoping it would be available, but it was not. However, many Yelpers have raved about the Station Burger, and it seemed to be a must-try at Richmond Station, so one of my friends and I ordered it to see what it was all about.

The rib-stuffed burger was decent. It was cooked to a medium rare and it was quite juicy. The fresh milk bun was good, however, the bottom of my burger was soggy, which made every bite incredibly messy. Besides that, their fries were nothing special. I can't say I would purposely visit Richmond Station again for the Station Burger.

My other two friends ordered the Braised Heritage Chicken and Bread Crusted Sea Bream. Both of them enjoyed their meal and had nothing to complain about.

We were all quite full after our mains, but a couple of us really wanted to try the Movie Snacks dessert. The portion was small, but it was a very interesting combination of sweets. I was especially looking forward to try the popcorn ice cream and coca cola meringue. I thought the best part of the dessert was the coca cola meringue...by far. Having recently visited Paris and enjoyed a variety of macarons, it made me wonder why I never came across a coca cola-flavoured macaron. (I just did a search, and found that Nadege did have coca cola macaron around Macaron Day back in 2012. There is no sign of its reappearance though.)

All things considered, I would dine at Richmond Station again, but I would not order the Station Burger again. Next time I visit, I hope their Scallop special will be available, since I have read so many good things about it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome! Delicious, fresh, creative, superb service and awesomeness packed into a lovely restaurant! Compliments to the team!

Sister wanted to visit this place since she's only in town for a week. Read through a few reviews and brought the family there. 

Upon recommendation, I ordered the burger. Not often do you see a restaurant who's confident enough to serve their burgers not charcoaled all the way through. You know how confident Richmond Station is about the freshness and quality of their meat. The burger was cooked just right, the meat didn't need to be charcoaled. I personally enjoyed having the core of the burger a bit on the rare side and they did exactly that! The caramelized onion, a hint of sweetness with the richness of cheese and their sauce - was the best combination! When they say they are able to meet your diet restrictions, they mean it! I asked for lettuce wrapped - they came up with an even better idea. Got creative and came up with lettuce buns! Best presentation ever! 

At where we sat, close to the kitchen in a small private area. We get to see their stock of meats, oil, nuts, etc. was extremely impressed of the type of oil they use. Everything natural and nothing processed. I was enjoying my food with confident! As Dr. Cate would say, she would rather smoke a cigarette than to eat anything done up with processed vegetable/plant based oil (quote \"liquid age/death in a bottle\"). It also takes a good chef to know how to compliment food with the oil they use, each natural oil has its own flavour. Compliments to the chef again! Because the oil used in the salad was amazing! 

Service was amazing, our server was very professional and came by often to ensure we were comfortable. I really appreciate he came over to ensure my parents had a constant fill of hot water. My sister broke a glass due to her expressive hands when talking... server came quickly to clear out the area. As we felt bad, the server was very nice, joked with us and ensuring us everything was okay. 

Overall, Richmond Station was great! Pricing is reasonable, in fact - I think for the quality of food to service, it's actually extremely good. Will definitely return and recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. The first visit, I realized it was the best burger I ever had.

Bringing friends from NY the second visit, I worried I'd talked it up too much. Not so.

The burger remains the best I've ever had. It looks really small but is hearty and so satisfying.

Our server was superb, recommending a great bottle of wine and joking around with us.

I had the Acid Test for dessert, because the first line of the description said, \"all the colours\". I was gorgeous and colourful, but I wouldn't have it again. It had a lot of interesting tastes, but wasn't my favourite.

If you want an INCREDIBLE burger, try Richmond Station!"}
{"text":"We sat at the kitchen bar, which is always fun. We shared the chicken special, polenta fries (must have) and each had the lamb croquettes salad. All of it was delicious. Great vibe and friendly staff. Check it out."}
{"text":"Another resto adding to my list of tops. The highlight was definitely dessert. I've been to numerous restaurants in the past that have attempted the whole deconstructed dessert thing and have failed epically. BUT Richmond Station knows what they're doing!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best restaurants Toronto currently has to offer. Had the eurobass, chickpea fritters, cod cakes, pulled pork rav, scallops, Guinness cake, lemon mouse....yes been there quite a bit . Great flavours and the one thing I really like is how the different flavours and textures compliment one another on the plate. The only thing I didn't like was the carrot cake but it was a matter of preference, very gingery, but my friends really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I'm from New Brunswick and with every bite I felt like I was having a gourmet version of the food I love. Delicious and decedent. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The staff are phenomenal. On par with Oliver and bonacini heavy weights Canoe and Auberge. We were greeted warmly and sat promptly (luckily we came to dinner on a long weekend Saturday evening at 630). Our server was likewise warm and chatty without being too in our faces. 

The food is everything u hear about: perfectly chilled and tart ceviche on a crisp corn chip that stood up to my two bite daintiness (my husband ate his share in a single go). My halibut in meso broth was so so so good. Perfectly cooked and not dry. Nice accompaniment in the veggies. Husbands burger was medium rare and so filling he did not eat all his fries. I of course had a handful of these and they were crisp and pillowy inside. 

Why not 5.  The ambiance is a bit clinical and the food came too fast. Our dinner was over in an hour."}
{"text":"Absolutely superb. Incredibly attentive and warm, unpretentious service - you can tell everyone working there just really appreciates great food. The attention to detail on the menu was special; every dish we had was nuanced and surprising. The highlight was the special dessert of the day - a white chocolate cheesecake with orange blossom jelly and Earl Grey ice cream! So inventive and indicative of the quality of, and inspiration behind, the food here. Also very reasonably priced for such prestigious quality - we had a shared starter, mains, drinks and a shared desert and it all came in under 120. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My party of 4 headed to richmond Station last nite. I was expecting a lot based on all the hype on yelp, and most talked about on Urbanspoon. I was impressed with the food. But more than that I was impressed with the impeccable service. I wish I knew all the servers names as I would call them out here but we were treated like kings and queens. So our table was late, by only a few minutes, and they insisted on sending over a free appy of polenta fries (beautiful! Crisp, flavourful) and for my lactose intolerant, seafood aversive friend, they brought over a corn ceviche, which she raved about. 

We sat at the chefs table, which if you are any bit interested in food and where it comes from and how it's prepared, this is the table to ask for at Richmond Station. The chefs were pleasant, greeting us with a smile, even in the middle of a jam packed dinner service. Our main server of the nite was a lovely woman (argh! Name!) and promptly greeted us and asked how we were while pouring our water glasses.

We started with charcuterie - a wonderful assortment of (mostly) pig products, made entirely in house.  My favorite was the pastry wrapped terrine with it's bold, rich and punchy flavours as well as the other terrine, which was made from venison. They made a very large board, and brought two and the 4 of us were definitely smiling!

Mains next - special Digby scallops which were perfectly cooked and seasoned and lovely with the sweet pea purée and the haricot verte. The finish of the lemon mint marmalade brought that wonderful acidity that competed every mouthful.  The braised beef ravioli was remarkably smooth yet blazened and the STN burger was juicy and cooked to a perfect medium rare. The BBQ chicken was so good, it was eaten to fast to even come up with a description! The only downfall of the main were the rosemary frites, which were rather unremarkable and slighty salty and a wee soggy. 

Richmond station has 4 desserts on it's menu - and there was 4 of us so that was an easy call. The saffron pudding, while seemed like a good idea, just had something off putting about it and was the weakest of the bunch.  The penny candy eclair was fun and whimsical with an amazing bubble gum sorbet, even though the pastry itself was a bit on the hard side.  The chocolate mousse with the scotch ice cream was another winner, with both providing contrasting flavours and exciting when mixed together.  Alas the blueberry corn cake and panna cotta was lack lustre, and lacked the oomph of the eclair and the mousse. But our party was surprised again, as a cook brought over their dessert special - a mammoth bowl of corn sabayon served with a plum sorbet. Despite the whole bowl looking totally yellow and in the need of some more colour, contrast again was the name of the game as the very very tart plum played against the sweet, silky corn like a battle royale, each trying to throw each other over the top rope!

Despite some misses (small as they were) Richmond Station truly lives up to the hype. The Chefs table was a great experience and the kitchen was quiet and refined and even with a full dining room (and I mean full!) the cooks were never in the weeds, never scrambling and consummate professionals. I do wish there was some Gordan Ramsay-ish profanity going on - it's always nice to hear that someone else is a f***ing moron for once - I do appreciate the job the cooks and the servers did last nite for our party and every nite for the entire city. 

Score - Highly Recommend"}
{"text":"An artistic and tasteful nod to the 50s. The transcendent music of Ray Charles was a nice compliment to the gourmet gastronomy. The knowledgeable and engaging staff made sure we were happy and well fed.
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food here was delicious! I had the duo pork and it was probably one of the best dishes ive ever had. The portion was a little smaller than I expected and it was a bit pricey but the dish just tasted so good. I also had a drink called the Bill Murray which was okay and pricey. Even though it was expensive I would still take a date to this restaurant"}
{"text":"Richmond Station has something for everyone.  Wether you're a vegetarian,  meat lover, beer drinker or you have a heavy sweet tooth.  

The atmosphere is very laid back and cozy with wonderful servers, who are knowledgeable and very friendly.  I feel at home when I eat at Richmond Station.  

My favorite dishes are the burger and fries, and the ravioli.....so far.  I have yet to try everything but I'm working my way to that.  The prices are reasonable considering the quality of the food.  It's not as cheap as eating at your local fast food chains granted, but that's because they use real quality meat that isn't processed and has been hand picked by them at local farms.

I love everything about Richmond Station, finally a spot in the Core that gives you quality and comfort.  A fine dining feel with a laid back touch.

The Stn S'more is to die for."}
{"text":"Very good. Oysters good. Beer good. Nothing else to say. My review was on the short side?"}
{"text":"Believe the hype - this place is amazing!  I was dining solo and sat at the chef's table. The chef personally not only created a specialized vegetarian tasting menu for me, but he also served most of the dishes to me.  The food was absolutely delicious, so fresh, very end of her you did, and beautifully presented.  oh, and did I talk about the service?  Every single person in the restaurant was so super friendly and helpful. They definitely added to the entire dining experience. Like I said, believe the hype and run here for a meal to remember!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a great brunch spot to surprised my boyfriend with for his birthday and came across RS online. Glad I did because the food was absolutely delicious! Each dish was packed with flavour and the presentation was impeccable. Not to mention, all of the staff were wonderful as well. Would come back again in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and well executed dishes.

My friend took me here for a birthday dinner and we ordered the following
Polenta Fries- very crispy on the outside with delicious tomato sauce
Chicken Liver Mousse on French Toast Crostini (special)- Mousse was deliciously light and wonderfully paired with the sweet french toast and marmalade.
Beef Ravioli- Has a strong mushroom flavor, which was so rich without being heavy
Bass with Gnocchi- Bass was nice and crispy, which nicely contrasted the buttery gnocchi.

We sat at the Chef's table (a bar that looks into the kitchen).  We thought it was very fun to look into the kitchen and seeing the chefs work- also helps that all the chefs are good looking guys.

Service on a whole was on point and very attentive.  Would wholly recommend to the point that I went back the week after for lunch!

Note that they do have a lunch prix fixe for $19 that includes a soup or salad and amain- I got the butternut squash soup and the roast beef sandwich with fries (was amazing)"}
{"text":"Went here Saturday night for our anniversary and there were pros and cons. Pros: they brought out prosecco on the house for the occassion, I thought that was so sweet. The food was absolutely amazing. I died a little when I tried the duck pate and the Eurobass was divine! All the food came out within minutes of order which was nice. The only con was that we had an encounter with our server that ruined the night for me... she rushed us the entire evening... come over 4 times to take our dinner order with about one minute gaps. When we were done dinner she did the same thing with dessert. I started to get uncomfortable with all of the pressure, we had had our first drink, app, and dinner within 40 minutes of getting there. I asked what the rush was for and she mentioned that they had another reservation coming in. I asked if that meant we were limited to a certain number of minutes at the table and she said they wouldn't kick us out but they do allow for a generous meal time with the expectation that guests will leave. I probably got too worked-up but I was so frustrated and upset, I told her how rude I felt that was and that I felt rushed all evening. She did apologize and they had someone else come wait on us after that. I don't know if the she said anything to the manager but he came by to say hi. Maybe I overracted but I was just so angry and it got awkward, so that it ruined the night for me and I can't stop talking about it ever since. My huband was super disappointed and mentioned I should share on yelp. Maybe it was a one off but we won't go back."}
{"text":"I went to Richmond Station on January 4th.  My guest and I were seated front row centre at the chefs table.  The food was amazing.  The service was awesome.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"First of all, the service at this restaurant was top notch. Just the right amount of everything, the timing of the food, the follow up from our waiter, the recommendations.

I had the pate salad to start. Never before have I had pate, and only ordered it because of the recommendation and it did not disappoint. For my main I had the scallop curried dish which was cooked so well. The sauce was just the right amount to bring out the flavour of the scallops. Lastly I finished off with the strawberry marshmallow chocolate ice cream desert which was light, refreshing, and tasty. 

Highly recommend this restaurant if you're in downtown Toronto. I made a reso so I didn't have an issue with getting a table, not sure on wait times for walk ins!"}
{"text":"We decided to stop here on our trip through Toronto on our way to my sister's wedding. Every part of our meal was incredible. We had the enormous oysters.
Then we got a recommendation to try the beef tartar, which was a great suggestion. The entrées were similarly delicious - the mushroom soup, the trout and the pierogi. They also have a fantastic selection of wines  to pair with your food choices. Overall, a really fun and gourmet way to spend a night in Toronto."}
{"text":"...With its deceiving shoe-box signage outside, the restaurant is actually composed of two good sized dining rooms and floors.  After poking our heads through the front door curtains, we were walked down a long hall of appropriately spaced tables, adorned with old black and white photos on our left and an adjacent bar on our right.  Barely visible to our table in this downstairs section was a large open kitchen dining room and an additional enclosed table along the wall upstairs. Actually, had I not had that extra cocktail and needed to seek out the ladies room, I might have not even noticed the additional space.  While the rooms were certainly set up differently, the atmosphere throughout the restaurant was comfortable, breathable and cheerful.  Lights were dim enough to allow for the table-top tea candles to emit a radiant glow, but thankfully, were not so dark that I may mistake my surroundings for one of the neighbouring clubs.  Likewise, noise levels were kept to an ambient, agreeable level.  It was just loud enough to create a buzz, but never so noisy that I felt myself strained to hear my partner or server speak.  This is unfortunately a pleasure I don't find so often anymore.  I also appreciated their clear attention to the thermostat, and the heavy wind-breaking curtains at the front. While in all honestly, I didn't experience RS in in bare-leg cocktail dress (come on, the two of us are so past that dress-to-impress phase), I'd bet I would get through the meal without a single drafty chill.

From the moment we walked in, the service was friendly and unpretentious- our jackets were hung, our drinks were poured, our meal was well timed and prompt (in and out in 1  1/2 hours).  While of course, having drinks refilled, and cutlery replenished is a very important attribute of good service, I am always more interested in smiles and enthusiasm and even a little humour when eating out. Thankfully, at RS, they've nailed them both, embodying a professional, yet pleasantly relaxed atmosphere that exudes feelings of warmth and welcome.

The drink menu predominantly draws attention to its good selection of local and international wines, about a third of which are available to drink by glass or half bottle.  They also feature an interesting variety of craft beers (draft and bottle), and about 7 different house-made cocktails.  I was honestly drawn by nearly every cocktail on the list, so I employed the server to help me make choices. Throughout the evening we sampled the Tequila Sour (Tromba, Egg White, Lime and Agave, $14), Cranberry Old Fashioned (Marker's Mark, Muddled Cranberries, Winter Syrup, $15) and French Twist (Zubrowka Vodka, Heering Cherry, Pineapple, $12).  While all of the cocktails were easy to drink and well-balanced, I found the flavours of the French Twist the most pleasantly assertive and enticing.  We also went for a half bottle of the Malbec \"Ben Marco\" fromDominio del Plata, Mendoza ($41), which made for a really smooth red wine to carry us through our meat-heavy mains.

Food at RS followed the theme set by the atmosphere, service and Heinrich himself- it balances cozy and comforting, with fresh and effortless beauty. Here you won't find pretentious descriptions, overly-complicated preparations, or fad-driven items to distract from respectfully treated proteins and seasonal veg.  But rather, RS offers a \"Pantry\" and \"Daily Chalkboard\" menu full of familiar, yet inspired farm-to-table flavours.  The kind of foods you might think of if a really sexy bachelor or bachelorette were to cook you the comfort foods you grew up with- what could be hotter than that?  

 Well, after some coaching from our server, we opted to share a good sampling of both their regular menu items and specials. We went for:

Salumi Board: Chocolate, Miso, Cassis, Burgundy, Walnut with Pickled Veg, Beet Chutney, Spicy Mustard, Crackers, and Bread with Baco Noir Vinegar and Olive Oil ($18)

A unique selection of gorgeous charcuterie, each with their own subtle nuances and textures. While the thought of chocolate salumi originally made me think of some gross-out lunch-room dare, it turned out to be the favourite of the night. I loved the mildly bitter aroma and slightly creamy texture of the chocolate against the salty satisfying chew of the fatty meat. I also particularly loved the beet chutney rolled into a slice of the rich walnut studded pork.  A great, sharable start to our meal.

Crispy Confit Chicken Wings: House-Made Kimchi, Soy Chili Salt ($12)

Thank goodness there were an even number of chicken wings for us to split, because odd-numbers of tasty-fried foods are really not a good way to kick off date night. These chicken wings were seasoned to perfection with an umami rich salt that brought ..."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, a few friends and I decided to try Richmond Station last night for dinner.   One of my friends had been here before, and was smart enough to order an appetizer along with her main.  However, the rest of us didn't, and wished we had.  Now, the food itself is delicious and very flavorful, and even smells divine.  The only problem is that the portions are on the smaller side, so we were still hungry by the end of the meal.  All of us (including my girlfriend who had the app), ended up having waffles at Marche afterwards.... lol.  The service is also excellent here.  The hostess took our coats, and even locked away my friend's work bag in their office.  Even though I know they are quite busy, we never felt like they were rushing us out the door, which is always a plus."}
{"text":"I came for lunch and had the burger. The fries were fab the burger tasty. You know this is a good place when Jamie Kennedy And norm hardie are lunching here. I had a question and the chef emailed me back himself. Now that's service. I was very impressed."}
{"text":"Amazing! We have gone several times and I highly recommend getting the tasting menu.  It is delicious and the price point really reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food.  Will be going back many times!"}
{"text":"They have amazing service - the staff are knowledgeable, friendly and unpretentious. We even had the awesome opportunity to meet and chat with the pastry chef! They were prompt with the delivery of our food, answered all of our questions (and my party had a lot of questions) and allowed us to book the \"pantry room\" which is a little room that is semi-private and has a great view of the kitchen! 

The food received mixed reviews. We all enjoyed the polenta fries and charcuterie appetizers, however the mains were met with mixed reviews. I personally enjoyed my sea bream, the station burger was super juicy and well cooked, however the wild boar ragu was found to be a tad lacking. The desserts, however, were awesome! We had the chocolate cake, the sorbets and a semi-frozen hay dessert (sounds weird but was the best of the desserts)!! 

We will definitely come back as we loved the vibe, the staff and the food! :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food, hospitality, ambiance, everything was amazing! We had charcuterie, corn soup, stn burger, slow cooked halibut. Love it!"}
{"text":"I had a reservation at Richmond Station when it first opened and cancelled. I got there for lunch today and kicked myself for waiting so long. I arrived early thanks to unpredictable TO traffic. I was seated right away to await my dining companion. I had a great table where I had a view of the pass and the brigade just starting service. They worked together so effortlessly I knew I was in for a great meal. 

I started with a pear and ?? soup with smoked chili oil. It was well balanced and silky smooth. Delicious.

I had the lunch special which was schnitzel with horseradish cream and roasted squash. It had a perfectly crisp crust and was tender.  My only minor complaint was it was served on a board which I could never seem to balance a knife and fork on. 

 The service was attentive and well timed. I never felt rushed despite the full dining room. 

I can't wait to go back to try the smoked trout!"}
{"text":"Came here for a dessert tasting menu and also decided to try a few apps for enjoyment. 

We tried their current selections of dessert they are offering:

MOVIE SNACKS   9
cherry cola, salted peanuts, twizzler puree, popcorn ice cream
- This one was alright, didn't think too much about it.

PULP FICTION   9
smashed pop tart, strawberries, sprite jelly, good coffee ice cream
- Didn't really like the smashed pop tart, and sprite jelly. The coffee ice cream was not bad.

PAN'S LABYRINTH   9
celery panna cotta, walnut earth, roasted grapes, mulled wine sorbet
- Creative looking dish. The mulled wine sorbet is an acquired taste for certain.

GHOSTBUSTERS   9
smoked apple twinky, green slime, stay puft foam, vanilla ice cream
- Most creative looking dish. Enjoyed the puft foam and ice cream. Twinky kind of dry. Green slime was something else.

Polenta Fries- Never really had much polenta before, so expectation of this being fries was alright. Its served with some marinara sauce and some light shreaded mozarella cheese. I thought this is alright, not really worth the $.

Duck Liver Pate- Its in a mousse form. Didn't really enjoy it that much.

While my scored aren't that great for this place, I can't be quick to jump and say this place is no good. I'm certain they serve good food, but we definitely missed out on them. The desserts are creative appearance wise. Taste wise is alright. Apps are alright, but nothing for me to jump out and want to get it again.

I would give this place another try next time on something else."}
{"text":"Delicious food and excellent service! Will defiantly be back. Husband and I ordered the lamb leg, beef sirloin and the Brussel sprout mushroom Caesar salad. Absolutely delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great time at Richmond Station tonight, thanks to Krista,  who provided great recommendations and friendly but professional service, and the Chef's who concocted a great tapas menu and brought it to our table with details of each dish. The Lobster Tempura was our favourite, but everything was well presented and flavourful. Walked in and seated without a wait in the bar area without reservations (Monday night) and took our sweet time reconnecting. Satisfied our hunger for 200 plus tip for 3. my tip - start with the \"smoke on the tracks\" cocktail, and go from there."}
{"text":"Just. Go. Here. Holy mother .The food is spectacular. Every single dish. Carefully thought out, flawlessly executed. We didn't  have a reservation and still managed to get a seat at the chefs table on a Saturday- the hosts were extremely friendly and accommodating. Started with the duck patè and the seafood chowder special. The patè was stellar- it was presented on a thin slice of crispy pretzel bread, topped with a bit of a sweet chutney, which was the perfect complement to the rich and decadent liver. The chowder was creamy, flavorful, and had pieces of fish and vegetables- it was maybe the best seafood chowder we've ever had. We then had the Lobster capellini and the skate wing. Good lord. The capelin I was packed full of lobster flavor- it was like a rich seafoody creamy sauce that left you wanting another bite the instant you were finished with your last. The lobster was perfect and generous, the pasta al dente and delicious. Again- yes- one of the best plates of pasta I've ever had. The skate was phenomenal- melted in our mouths, and served with a citrus sauce unlike any I've ever had. The potatoes and zucchini were the perfect mates to the skate- seriously- they just nailed the ever living everything out of this dish. We had dessert too - the chocolate torte -which was a an explosion of different textures and flavors. So, so good. Our server was super friendly and helpful, and the manager was engaging and wonderful. Can you tell we liked Richmond Station. When I get back to Toronto, I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I give Richmond Station 5 stars for its creativity with favors and presentation. Never have I been to a restaurant that pays such special attention to integrating various ingredients to create interesting dishes that taste like nothing I've ever experienced before when combined. The concierge at the Toronto Trump a international recommended that my husband and I try this top chef restaurant for our last night in Toronto, and we were glad we took his advice.

My husband and I both ordered specials from the chalkboard. After sharing a bread salad, my husband had the trout entree, while I had the scallop entree. Both dishes were uniquely prepared and delicious. We shared the movie snacks dessert, which was like food art meets science experiment--ice cream that tastes like popcorn, cake and peanut crumbles that taste like a chocolate candy bar, pink crumbles that tastes like Coca Cola, and a decorative red smeared sauce that tastes like Twizzlers candy. By far, the most interesting and memorable dessert I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Their great and attentive service is only exceeded by the care they put into each dish. My friend and I ordered 4 appetizers to share and dessert. Our favourite appetizers of the night were the bulgogi steak tartare and halibut fish pancakes. The tartare was bursting with flavour and paired very well with the wonton chips. The halibut fish pancakes resembled croquettes more than anything, but were stuffed with very fresh fish. 

The highlight of the night though was, for sure, dessert. We shared the Japanese cheesecake with matcha ice cream and the sholeh zard (saffron ice cream with saffron tapioca pudding, rhubarb, and chickpea-pistachio crumble). The cheesecake was light and fluffy as is expected of the Japanese style. The sholeh zard impressed me the most as it was a beautiful combination of exotic flavours, where you could feel the chef's conviction for dessert in every bite. A truly wonderful experience and I will be sure to come back to try their mains and other dessert items."}
{"text":"This was one of the rare occasions when Yelp reviews didn't live up to our expectations. 

I was expecting a lot more based on the stellar reviews, but we found the portions small and the restaurant overhyped. It wasn't BAD, but not worth the near-perfect ratings on Yelp. 

Meh."}
{"text":"Das Restaurant liegt ganz unscheinbar und ist von außen kaum zu erkennen. Wenn ich nicht gewusst hätte, dass es dort ist, dann wäre es mir vermutlich gar nicht aufgefallen. Vorweg ein Tipp, unbedingt reservieren! Wenn man Glück hat bekommt man noch einen Platz an einem langen Tisch, wenn nicht, dann muss man wohl ein anderes Mal wiederkommen.
Von innen ist das Restaurant sehr schön und gemütlich eingerichtet. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und aufmerksam und auch die Speisekarte lässt keine Wünsche offen. Alle Speisen sehen nicht nur sehr schön aus, sie schmecken auch genial gut. Für mich persönlich ist der Station Burger einer der besten Burger, die ich bislang gegessen habe, aber das muss wohl jeder für sich entscheiden. Wenn dann noch etwas Platz ist, sollte man unbedingt eines der kunstvoll angerichteten, köstlichen Desserts probieren. Das lohnt sich auf jeden Fall!
Insgesamt war es ein sehr schöner Abend in einem sehr schönen Restaurant mit tollem Essen und ich werde beim nächsten Besuch auf jeden Fall wieder vorbeikommen."}
{"text":"Had a great business lunch here.  The service is prompt and attentive, the food arrives quickly after you order and you can be in and out in just over an hour or less.  I had the lettuce wraps with quinoa salad and my friends had the burger.  Everyone enjoyed their meal and I am looking forward to trying their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Delicious food all around! 

We went and ordered a few things from the menu and the Stn. Burger is to die for! Everything was amazing and the services was great! We're told they also do a \"Chef's choice\" for a set price and multiple dishes, we will definitely get that next time here there!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Toronto serving the best burger to this day along with delicious fries. I came on a day where they had chicken wings as the daily special and they were one of the best wings I've ever had."}
{"text":"Definitely make a reservation; we were able to squeeze in at the bar because it was just two of us, but it would have been nice to linger at a table.  Regardless, the service was prompt and attentive and the food was absolutely delicious.  We started with the pate on brioche; it came topped with apple chutney and sea salt and it was a perfect blend of salty and fatty and sweet.  Dinner was the striploin for both of us, served with brussels sprouts, parsnips (two ways, a parsnip mash and homefries), and potatoes.  Desserts are extremely inventive, and in a nod to the season, all of them seem to come with ice cream.  I had the parsnip cake (what can I say, I love the stuff), served with a smoky chestnut ice cream and an orange marmalade.  The cake itself wasn't very sweet, which let the other elements of the dish shine. My dining partner ordered the chocolate tart, which came with black tea ice cream and a frozen orange foam. Lots of rich chocolate flavour, a great way to finish off the meal.  We were both very impressed."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Was staying at the Hilton nearby and decided on this restaurant - definitely not disappointed. Got a table without a reservation, surprisingly. 

Loved the menu, the waitress was very intelligent and helpful. Everyone enjoyed the food and left with a good impression. When we were done, I did a quick walk-around to see the back of the restaurant (since we were seated by the door) and they have a very neat open kitchen. To my surprise, one of the waitresses offers to give me a tour of the kitchen! As a student planning on going to culinary school next year, I was so excited. I got to meet the executive chef - who took time to shake my hand and say hello. Got to see the 'meat room' (not sure what it's called), which was very neat to see all the cuts of meat and such. 

Anyways, I was very pleased and would definitely recommend the restaurant to anyone :)

(This visit was a couple months ago before my review, by the way)"}
{"text":"A couple friends had recommended This spot and it did not disappoint. Portions were small but the flavour and presentation made up for it. I had the risotto and my sister had the burger. Great ambiance and service was professional and friendly. I will recommend to others."}
{"text":"If you haven't been there, you should go for it. The Chef who won Top Chef Canada was there looking at the dishes and I was impressed. Some other restaurants wouldn't care and leave it all to the sous chef. You know your food will come out good.

Unfortunately I didn't had a chance to take picture of the food I order but there's picture to look at :D.
Overall, food was good and didn't stand out too much. Their famous burger was definitely good but it was a mess eating it. My favorite was the dessert. It had a lot of contrast. 

I will definitely go again and try something new."}
{"text":"My friend and I were in Toronto on vacation and wanted to try something new, well we got way more than we expected.  The food here was soooo good that we are still taking about it.  It is by far one of the best restaraunts that I've eaten at."}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me to RS for my birthday and we had a great time. Deliscious food and great service."}
{"text":"This place is excellent.  The food is perfectly proportioned, scrumptious regardless of what flavour you order and always leaves the feeling of satisfaction!  I brought my wife for her 40th, and she loved it!  Our server Steve was top notch and cared about presentation and listened even when my wife was thinking \"wine\" half out loud.  Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"This review is just for their drinks and service. 

We came here after a full meal from The Chase, for a couple of cocktails. On the advice of the server, I ordered their spin on a negroni (I forget the name now, and they don't have a cocktail menu online but it was called something something negroni). She mentioned that she liked it because it reminded her of a margarita, and in hindsight, the ingredients made it sound margarita-like: tequila, grapefruit juice, aperol, salt, and maybe something else. 

Let's just say when I got it, I tasted nothing reminiscent of a negroni, and it was most definitely tasted like a margarita. That would've been fine and all if they hadn't tried to pass it off as a negroni in the first place! The server came by and asked me if I liked my drink, and I wavered a bit, and said it wasn't what I expected. She happily offered to make me something else, so I suggested just a regular negroni. I really appreciated that. 

My boyfriend ordered a scotch on the rocks and then a Montenegro after, and enjoyed his. 4 stars for service and a good-sized negroni :) Will definitely try and come back here for the food!"}
{"text":"So f---ing good. We went on March 24 for lunch.

We didn't have a reservation, so we sat at the communal table. We started with the mushroom soup with garlicky croutons - so nuanced and delicious. And, wow, they don't charge for bread (we're looking at you, Ava in Tampa). We then had the braised beef ravioli - delicious and perfectly done. Great wine selection too! We had the sacher torte for dessert. Delicious as well, though there was almost too salty an edge to it. Also, our server was great. My friend is a huge pain in the neck at restaurants and our server never lost her cool. Overall, I would go back in a heartbeat. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch during the work week. Overall, the food at RS is very well executed - nothing overcooked or over/under seasoned. Chef balances textures and flavors like a dream. Every dish was delightfully pleasant and clean.

In general, no flavors or ingredients that are going to blow your mind. Rather, a smart and clever play on great quality and seasonal Canadian ingredients executed perfectly. A solid food experience. 

I had the lunch time prix fixe. A great deal if you ask me : $21 for an app and entree in smaller portions. I started with the Quinoa salad. So good you don't even miss the meat. Loved the play on texture and crunch. For my main, had the Lamb orecchiette. Pasta was again well executed. Slight Moroccan-flavor profile. My date and I shared the Wild Leek Croquettes and he ordered the eurobass. Both highly recommend for lunch. Light and delish.

The staff - super casual. Almost to a fault because it doesn't match the high caliber of food and service offered there. The crowd at lunch - a bunch of Bay Street suit and tie folks and the occasional ladies who lunch table.

Would def recommend the prix fixe and looking at their specials.  Great food but the space tightly packed and seated very close together so not my ideal place for an intimate meal. Absolutely a place for foodies, vegetarians, and plates to share with close friends."}
{"text":"Before coming here i had very high expectations, as their executive chef was the winner of Top Chef Canada season 2, or something :P. Boy were my expectations met. Me and my dad decided to eat from the chefs menu, which was 6 (might have been 7) courses of pure awesome. Each plate offered something new and interesting, but all were equally tasty. The great thing was that we got lucky and had seats right in front of the kitchen, so we got to see the chefs making it right i front of our eyes! Great atmosphere, awesome service. I know where i'm dining out on my next birthday!"}
{"text":"What a great place.  This place shines simply because of the food.   No pretentiousness, no fancy plating, no ridiculous structure built up high on top of the food, just plain old handcrafted delicious creations that make your mouth water and you wonder how there is so much flavour packed into something that looks so simple. 

I had the beef short rib ravioli and it was amazing.  Full of flavour, each ravioli piece stuffed with a generous chunk of slow cooked beef that will make you wonder why every other ravioli you've had is filled with mush.  The only other time I can remember being so startled by seemingly plain pasta was at Mario Batali's wonderful Babbo in NYC. 

Polenta fries were good and interesting but not something I'd order again.  My dining companions had fish dishes and were equally impressed."}
{"text":"Came to Richmond Station with my boyfriend for our anniversary and had a great time. They accommodated our day-of reservation, fitting us in at 9:45pm on a Friday night. Despite arriving 10-15 minutes late for our reservation, the service was fast and professional. The food was fresh, beautifully presented, and tasted absolutely delicious! We enjoyed a bottle of cava, oysters, polenta fries, a charcuterie plate, pâté, and ravioli. From start to finish this was a great culinary experience. 

My only criticism was against our who could have been a bit friendlier when we asked for her to take a picture of us for our anniversary, instead of making us feel as though we were imposing. Small gestures can have a huge impact and can make a tip percentage go from 18-20% to 25%+"}
{"text":"I visited on Halloween with a group of friends and came away disappointed.  I had high expectations from all the buzz around this place, but had a very ordinary restaurant experience.  It makes me question how good the chefs on reality cooking shows are.

For appetizers we had the the:
polenta fries - this was good, the sauce was tasty and had a nice kick to it
eggplant caponata - this was tasty, but I don't I would order it again
lobster cocktail - this wasn't very good.  The batter was not very crispy & too thick, like something I once made when I was too drunk to go to McDonalds drive through for nuggets.

For my main I had the coq au vin.  The dark meat was flavourful and juicy.  The white meat was cooked to perfection and very tender.  The crisp skin on top was a nice contrast of texture.

I also ate half of my wife's duck confit.  Unfortunately this is the dish that places my review in the solid 3 range.  It was dry, something I've never had with a duck confit before.  It was dryer than the ducks you get from a Chinese BBQ take-out when they're about to close and will sell you the duck that's been hanging there under heat lamps all day for half price.

Overall I wouldn't go out of my way to return, but would eat here again without protest if someone else planned it."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for my birthday dinner. The service was good. The server said happy birthday to me when we just arrived. And the food was good too. My husband and I very like the appetizers and desserts here. They're savory and delicious . The mains was tasty too, but the taste didn't surprise us or meet our expectations(compared to the appetizer). The price was so reasonable, so I highly recommend this restaurant. I'll definitely come back and try another plates."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Thursday night, still quite busy. A cool little spot, that looks like it's tucked away between the buildings.

Small menu, but everything is done so well. I tried the swordfish (chalkboard item) which was just absolutely amazing. Friend had the halibut which also did not disappoint.

The desserts look like something out of a Michelin-starred restaurant. I had the dark chocolate kulfi, not too sweet, and a great combination of flavours. My friend had the saffron ice cream, which was luxuriously creamy.

Definitely recommend this spot. Although, because of it's size I'd say it's not so good for large parties, but it's the perfect place for a date!"}
{"text":"3.5/5! St. Burger is delicious! Absolutely loved the scallops as well and Cracker Jack dessert! The coq au vin was alright but not as good as the burger! Ask for the spicy sauce with the fries."}
{"text":"We were introduced this restaurant by our hotel concierge and couldn't have been anymore happier! The food was amazing. We got the meat appetizer, with all different types of meats and it was delicious! You could definitely feel how fresh the food was and the great quality. Next time we come back to Toronto, we sure will be here!"}
{"text":"If you want to try new flavors this the place. Although it's quite pricey, it's perfect for special occasions."}
{"text":"Super nice place, clean, kitchen opened and a warm climate. The famous plate (Hamburger) was divine and so well cooked. The local beer offered was incredible as well and the waitress was so kind. She gave me a lot of tips of sightseeing of Toronto and was friendly all the time. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Lively restaurant but quite hard to have a conversation. Noise level is the same at lunch and dinner. 

Food is good. Nice beef tartar chips. Good use of ingredients.

Have returned a few times."}
{"text":"Richmond Station has been on my list for a while and was finally able to go recently for lunch.

I had the quinoa salad as an appetizer and it was absolutely amazing (can honestly say it was the best quinoa dish I've ever had). My main was jerk chicken and I was very happy.

The atmosphere was great (felt trendy, a nice buzz).

I would go back!"}
{"text":"The best restaurant in this part of town by a mile.  It doesn't look like much from the street but the interior is cosy and comfortable if a bit on the loud side.

I have been half a dozen times and everything I have ever eaten there has been fantastic.  Hands down the best gourmet hamburger in Toronto.  Frequent changes to the menu and specials so there's always something new to try.  Good, attentive and helpful staff.

You used to be able to just walk up and get a table except in real peak hours, but word is getting out about this place more and more.  So reservations really are a must."}
{"text":"Another hot spot that I needed to check out before I left for Hong Kong was Top Chef Canada's season 2 winner Carl Heinrich and his partner (both ex-Marben) Ryan Donovan's newest project, Richmond Station.  The theme of a train station seems fitting by it's location, in the heart of the financial district and on Yonge street which is the main street where our city's transit system traverses and by it's decor, using white sterile subway tiles and high ceilings to create the ambience of a station.

We decided on a couple of sharing plates for the evening for our dinners as there was a lot of good options to share on the menu:
We started with oysters which were from New Brunswick - we ordered a dozen to indulge in and they were very fresh and we enjoyed all the house made accoutrements which were the standard fare of mignonette, marinara and hot sauce.
We couldn't resist and ordered their charcuterie - it was lovely presented with a lamb and juniper terrine, fennel and chilli sausage, shaved ham and 2 fried small croquettes of pate.  All was delicious and another way to satiate our appetites.
The polenta fries are a must have  on their menu - they are crispy and perfectly battered on the outside but on the inside it's the mushy goodness from the polenta and served with a bomba mayo which isn't as fiery as you may think so it's good for the masses!
We also had the lobster cocktail - which was different from what I had originally envisioned of fresh succulent pieces of juicy lobster presented in a martini glass.  This version was battered chunks of lobsters on a piece of lettuce with a dollop of cocktail sauce.  It was very underwhelming.
Finally we had the smoked trout - it was a very healthy dish served with kale, soybean hummus and antipasto that included nice chunks of eggplant, it was a balanced dish but had a lot going on and I think for me, it was my least favourite.
The service was impeccable though and to make a comment that even in it's first month, the food, service and timing of everything was very good is a nice change for a new restaurant on the block.
For my friends who are bankers or work in the area, they are serving up lunches too!
 It is definitely a lively spot to check out especially if you are in the financial district."}
{"text":"Great service, amazing food. We only got appetizers as we were too full for mains and everything we tried was fantastic.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food and great services. A little crowded on a Friday night. 
The atmosphere was wonderful. Perfect for date night or gathering with a couple friends. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I was so pleased by a meal.  I knew just by taking the first so of my iced tea I was in for a treat.   Forget the over sweetened Nestea. Richmond Station had a wonderfully delicate tea with just a hint of sweetness.   The perfect refresher on a hot day. 

For my main, I ordered one of the daily specials which featured seared scallops, spicy sausage, cous cous, asparagus and roasted pepper puree.  The scallops were cooked to perfection with a great sear.  The cous cous had a great creamy flavour and the puree added a great zip to the dish.  I could eat that dish everyday.

I do have to add that while the dish left me completely content - I can see that it probably wouldn't fill a guy with a larger stomach.  I guess they'll have to order a starter which I'm confident would be more than worth it."}
{"text":"Finally tried the burger, after reading all of the rave reviews! 

It's... ok, but I'm not inclined to return. 

The medium rare doness and beet chutney are what make it memorable: juicy meat and a nice acidic kick. Otherwise, the flavour of the burger patty itself wasn't very memorable. It looked a bit small too, but after finishing the plate with fries I was surprisingly full. 

Speaking of fries, I couldn't taste the rosemary: tasted regular. 

Nothing special going on with the bun either.

All in all a decent meal.

The decor and atmosphere are decent. 
Service was fine."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! The mushroom soup was so flavorful. My hubby had the sirloin steak and the sauce and mushrooms in it were a perfect a
Balance of rich and savory. Finally we had the apple crisp for dessert. Candied mustard seed and oatmeal mixed with sugar, butter, walnuts and apples next to sumac ice cream. The best, most creative dessert I've ever had. Being from la. I am convinced the Canadians really know  how to eat.  I hope the chef moves to la. So good!"}
{"text":"Ok, so let's be clear! I am many things, but I love a good burger. THIS is the place in Toronto to have burger cooked medium rare and with a braised rib inside....AMAZING !
Craig does an amazing job with the food..but I come back for the service. Mandy, Jason, Christa , Cody. I feel like I'm home.
Just had Sea Bream ( I know Burger Guy)
It was spectacular. So, ya gotta go!"}
{"text":"Was there Feb 1 about 6:30PM.  Crowded, loud.  No issues there.  Great service.  But the food was mixed and expensive.  I had what I thought was the house chardonnay and it was $10/ounce!  My four glasses cost $60.  I had the grilled hanger steak.  The mushrooms that came with the 6 ounces of steak were way better than the steak, which I think could have been cut at a better angle to reduce the chewiness.  My dining partner had salmon that I could tell had been cooked Sous Vide because I could see the white ring around the outside edge of the fish.  Do they just dump it out of the bag onto the plate?  Really?  But the Service was great."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time. The staff was very friendly, and we were seated promptly. I had the   Pork headcheese & pork loin. It was delicious. My friend had her rabbit liver pâté with apricot chutney and crostini. It was super good. We were fond of the taste. This was a very cool place. The atmosphere was very authentic and the service was good. The brunch selections were plentiful and the quality was fine. 

I highly recommend this place. It has a great option for both lunch and dinner. I'm going brought my family here and I'm sure they'll going to loved it. It is very relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great service!  My boyfriend and I just finished dinner here and enjoyed every bite. Our server, David, was wonderful and attentive although our table was touched by at least five different people throughout the meal to top up water, deliver food and check on us. It was a great meal and a great night. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"A fantastic restaurant with possibly the best service I've had in Toronto, and with consistently phenomenal food. We love taking family and friends from out of town here, it is always bang on."}
{"text":"Creative dishes.  Fish entree (special) and all sides/accessories were great.  Appetizers (jerk turkey & pan-fried trout) were somewhere below mediocre.  Skip 'em."}
{"text":"The smoke on the tracks cocktail was my favorite cocktail ever. It had bourbon, ginger, something smokey, a giant ice cube, I need to go back there and figure it out."}
{"text":"Without a flaw!! 

I've personally been here twice, and loved my experience both times! However, I wanted to write this review mainly because I work in hospitality and consistently send guests to this restaurant and they come back with raving reviews every time! 

The fresh menu on the chalk board is always something to look forward to and the food itself is full of freshness in every bite!  The service is down-to-earth while knowledgeable and friendly. 

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Arrived in Toronto on business on Monday night.  This place was close and got great reviews, so I and 3 business colleagues chose to walk in.  We couldn't have been happier that we'd done so.  Our server, Nika, was wonderful.  The food was outstanding.  We tried several different options from the tasting menu and shared.  The oysters were the best we've ever had so we ended up getting another dozen for dessert, as well as a dessert which was also delicious.  They gave us a tour of the kitchen where we got to meet the wonderfully talented staff and owners behind the scenes.  We were treated like royalty here.  We fell so in love with this place that we went again on Tuesday night and sat at the chef's table where we were served a chef's choice meal with more oysters, the best pate I've ever eaten, the prime rib (wow), rabbit, trout salad, etc., etc.  This is a MUST do when visiting Toronto.  Ask for a tour.  Enjoy the people and the food.  The staff is so kind and genuinely happy to be making their food as art and welcome you to be a part of it all."}
{"text":"My friend and I sat at the chef table which was directly in front of the kitchen. As fun as it was to see the kitchen action, we ended up smelling like dinner. 

We ordered three appetizers which was more than enough food for the both of us. The beef tartare was good but uninteresting. The perogie croquette was delicious and a nice twist. And the chaurcuterie was one of the best I've had in the city."}
{"text":"The service and food was exceptional. We came here after our best friend purchased her wedding dress to celebrate and the staff was incredibly accommodating and made the experience so special for us. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Great service!!! However, it's a bit over hyped and overpriced
Chickpea croquettes- it was small falafel pieces
Charcuterie board- amazing, loved their duck pate
Chicken wings- it was the daily special sweet and spicy wings. $10 for 5 wings over priced and kinda boring
Chicken sausage- beautifully made
Dessert the carrot cake was delicious 
Their cocktails were pretty spot on!! Good job to whoever came up with that menu"}
{"text":"Good food but small portions and kind of overpriced for what it is.

I really enjoyed the STN Burger. The beet chutney was delicious and complimented the flavours well. The burger was just a lot smaller than I imagined for $21 so I thought it was overpriced. The plate was 90% fries, which were also good, but I would have liked a bigger burger.

The cauliflower agnolotti was good, although I found the greens that came with it to be a little too charred. Overall it wasn't too heavy which was nice.

The location is very convenient at Yonge and Richmond but easy to miss as the storefront is quite small. There is more seating at the back of the restaurant but make sure you make a reservation just in case."}
{"text":"Truly a Canadian hipster gem, took a bit to find it but it was well worth it. Being a native New Yorker where there's a restaurant boasting of it's American (New) fare at nearly every corner.  I thought it would be appropriate to try out the Canadian (New) fare as it was my first trip to Toronto. This place did not disappoint, offering a good selection of good deep homey lunches (I will say the neighboring guests ordered a quinoa salad to start, so glad I didn't order it because it was one of those small portion where they artistically place it to one quarter side of the plate for presentation, I think they call it \"soigné\" on top chef) uhm no thank you please fill the plate :) Otherwise I will say all things ordered were on point, including beet salad, tuna tartare, cornish hen and the station burger (which could be a bit heftier) but all in all was a great lunch and the atmosphere was very cool and fun.

Thanks Richmond Station!

{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Toronto.  Atmosphere is fun and food + wine is off the chain.  Been here 4 times and always satisfied."}
{"text":"Ordered both the salad an entree special. Both were excellent. Sat by myself at the chef's table - enjoyed the kitchen view. Wait staff were very pleasant.  Enjoyed the standing bar as I waited for a spot - a nice entrance and a good way to interact with other diners before going off on your own.  Laid back, but energetic ambience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend booked a table for my birthday and he did the right thing! The food is amazing! !!! Trout tartare was delicious,  the duck cooked perfectly and you can keep an eye on what's going on in the kitchen which is amazing. Can't wait to return their"}
{"text":"Chef's menu was a mind blowing experience for only $70 per person and 9 courses. Would definitely come back, especially for their rabbit/cod mains and dessert!"}
{"text":"that cracker jack dessert, with the peanut brittle, popcorn ice cream... amazing. this is a must order dish, so save room for dessert. 

we had the polenta fries, beef carpaccio, seared scallops, and the venison. I found the venison just a bit overcooked, but the vegetables that came with the venison dish were amazing (loved the rutabaga).

the Top Chef name might make this place a bit over hyped but the food is great and worth a visit."}
{"text":"food was ok, nothing special but the crowd and atmosphere of the restaurant is nice and chill.  It is a good place for happy hour and to go after work to chill and have drinks."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Richmond Station about a week ago and am still thinking about it. The customer service was amazing. Everyone in the restaurant was friendly and really looked after the customer. I really wanted to try the halibut special, but it had lobster mashed potatoes which I am allergic to. They didn't even blink when I asked them if it was possible to get something besides the lobster mashed due to an allergy and quickly took care of it. I loved how my meal was presented and ingredients repeated to me as it was placed down on the table. My halibut was delicious, every bite was amazing. For dessert I was torn between two things and the waitress highly suggested the Cracker Jack dessert, which was one of the two I had narrowed it down to. HOLY MOLY, it was amazing! Popcorn ice cream?! Who knew how wonderful that could be. I wish I had had more time in Toronto. I would have loved to have gone back to Richmond Station and enjoy another meal."}
{"text":"I went here Friday evening with my husband. We made a reservation - which I highly recommend because it can get busy. The only reason I heard of this place was because they had a stand at TUM (Toronto Underground Market) serving their \"Station\" burger which is absolutely delicious! 

Their menu is quite short but very creative. To start, we had the chicken pakoras & sweet potato chips with sriracha. Both were very crispy and delicious! Portion sizes were also small enough that we weren't full for our main.

For the mains, I had the station burger and my husband had the braised heritage chicken. As expected (since I had tried it before), the station burger was delectable. It came with a side of rosemary fries - there were sooo many, don't know how anyone would be able to finish them all! My husband's chicken they said had been braised for 48 hrs, and it definitely came through in the flavours.

The best part of the meal was the dessert. We had the \"Movie Snacks\" which for some reason isn't on the menu but I know of it because I read about it here before I went. It is a chocolate \"bar\" with ketchup chip crumbles, Twizzler puree and Coca Cola foam. It sounds funny but I dare you to try it, it was amazing!!! I would go back here for the dessert alone.

Oh and I had a chili-based cocktail which had really interesting flavours as well, and came topped with a red chilli. So good!

The service is the reason I am removing a star - the wait time between our apps and main was extraordinarily long - people near us came and went in the time that we were being served. Also, our waiter didn't tell us about the specials, we had to figure them out ourselves by looking at what had been written on the board."}
{"text":"If I could, I'd give this place a 4.5. My wife and I walked in this past Saturday at 6 and were seated immediately. We had the soft shell crab share plate, the pork special with various cuts of the pig, and the burger. Every dish was cooked perfectly with great quality and flavour. 

The service here is exceptional. I have a nut allergy and was assured that nothing had touched nuts, and was explained what everything was on each plate. As I was about to eat the soft shell crab, a hostess came and explained that the pesto sauce could have nuts and promptly took it back. The chef personally apologized and a fresh dish came back quickly.

Great place, great ambience, great service, great food!"}
{"text":"Last night 6 of us went to Richmond Station to celebrate a special birthday. We were seated  near the open kitchen and able to watch Carl Heinrich and his team in action. We had the Chefs Table and it was a treat. All was excellent, especially the venison strudel, smoked trout, beet and quinoa salads,polenta fries, whole grilled fish and ribeye. The wine selections are reasonably priced and a nice dessert platter was also served. On top of this the servers are super friendly and NICE. Can't wait to go back to this restaurant and I recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"I think the food and the price points do not align. There are places that have blown me away and this was not one of them."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, waitress was great but the hostess spoiled it all!  She couldn't tell us how long we had to wait just asked us to wait by the side lounge.  Waited long for a drink order at the lounge.  When we asked her again how long the wait was (after 15 mins), she came across quite rude."}
{"text":"Tucked away on Richmond Street you might not just wander by here and think to go in - but make it a stop on your Toronto culinary adventure train! I'm always happy when i dine here, i recommend it to friends and they are never disappointed. It's cozy, staff are friendly and the food is delish. I LOVE the polenta frites."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of great things about this place and finally decided to give it a shot. 
The price is pretty competitive so that's always a plus. Doing my best to be objective about the food given all the hype surrounding the place. Gotta say that the food really wasn't anything to write home about. Decent food but not amazing, worth a try if you have a chance though."}
{"text":"Love. I am in love. And I have no more money in my wallet but that's beside the point. The only negative was that it took a little long between the salad and the main from the prix fixe menu but this place still deserves 5 stars. Great food, great service, excellent wine, excellent food. Seated promptly at reservation time and was out in an hour fifteen. Not bad for a packed restaurant and a table of 4 on a Friday lunch. Highly recommend the quinoa salad and lamb merguez sausage. Altitud malbec was out of this world! Would like go back for dinner to see what else is up the sleeve."}
{"text":"Top chefs don't mess around! This was one of the best meals I've had in a long time.

It's cozy and hoppin' inside, even on a weeknight. We didn't have reservations but lucked out and got seated quickly in the back room. 

Salami platter, cured in-house - fantastic. Get it!
Orecchiette with wild boar ragu - this was EXACTLY what I needed after being out all day in the cold/rain. So comforting. Plenty of chunks of meat, and pasta was perfectly al dente.
Duck breast (daily special) - perfectly cooked and a sizeable portion. What really shone on this dish were the sauces, one was a hollandaise and the other tasted like it was brown sugar/butter. So so good!
Ice cream sandwich - walnut ice cream between crunchy graham crackers with apples on top and a whiskey caramel sauce. This was divine, and one of the best desserts I've ever had.

I thought prices were quite fair given the quality of the food. Will definitely come back next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Make a reservation to avoid disappointment as it is quite small. The food is fantastic; fresh and flavourful. Great presentation. Cozy spot ideal for a date."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a rainy weekday night. 
The ambience was relaxed, open and bright. At the same time, it was a very small and cozy restaurant. There were only a few tables occupied.
We brought in our own wine, $25 for corkage. 
We started with beet salad and smoked trout. Both were delicious and nicely presented.
Main course I had the special, duck confit. That was the highlight of the night. The meat just fell of the bone and the flavor in the vegetable and sauce was incredible. I've had a lot of duck. This by far is probably the best one.
The white fish came with a clam chowder type base, with crabs and a bunch of seafood. you can taste all the different seafoods in the dish.
Dessert we had the s'more and a pumpkin gingerbread with ice cream, both were really good.
What really impressed me was the amount of thought and detail that goes into each dish. All the components on the plate had a purpose, and they worked perfectly with each other. All plates came out gorgeous and service was attentive.
This might just be our new go-to place."}
{"text":"Richmond Station has excellent food, great service and a fun atmosphere. The dishes are always interesting, well prepared and delivered quickly (without ever feeling rushed). The food is well priced and you always feel like you are getting great value for your money.

Fav dishes: The potato and ramp perogies are absolutely amazing. The braised beef ravioli and scallop ceviche are also quite good. I had some type of ground pork pasta dish almost a year ago that I still think about and crave to this day! 

Highly recommend Richmond Station and can't wait for our next visit."}
{"text":"Richmond Station is as solid as always. They do such a good job at keeping the quality of the food at such a high level. they have one of the best burgers that i know. But other menu items have never failed me. make sure that you make a reservation they are most likely going to be busy... yes, also on a Monday. good job RS!"}
{"text":"Went to Richmond Station a few wks ago. We sat at the chefs table and had the tasting menu. 
Started off with oysters. Then had the charcuterie and a beet salad. For mains we had the trout and venison. Everything was amazing! Especially the beet salad! 
Reservations are a must!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner without reservations and hostess got us a table without too long a wait. First I have to say the martinis were great! All our meals were good. Portion size is on the small side. Standout food items were the fresh oysters, duck liver pate, grilled fish and rabbit.

Restaurant was completely full and our waiter took good care of our table. As we had coffee and cognac, he was smart enough to see this was a business function and left us alone to talk. I have been to this restaurant many times and it's very consistent. Innovative food and exceptional service."}
{"text":"Visited last December. We ordered the rabbit and pork pate en croute to start with, which was fantastic. I ordered the duck duo as a main. The duck croquette was soo good and the duck breast melted in your mouth. I would have like just a bit more jus. My partner ordered the rabbit two-ways and was not as pleased with his dish. He thought that the rabbit was dry and that the daikon was not complimentary to the dish. We share a snowman/cardamon ice cream creation for dessert and and it was a total hit with both of us. Yummy! The restaurant is very lively but too noisy and patrons are packed all too close together for our taste. We tried it, had a nice meal but will probably not return."}
{"text":"Fancy restaurant with great food!

I would recommend making reservations. We didn't and ended up at the high table. It is cool if you don't mind sitting next to strangers. 

The drinks and food were great. I had the fish main course and got blown away. The portion is not huge but definitely enough if you are having appetizers and desert."}
{"text":"Had the fixed lunch. Salad was good but main dish lacked any substance. Bland, flavorless and just a bizarre combination of measly chicken with barely any meat and bitter tasting salad thrown on top. Really expensive and overpriced for what you actually get. Service was good but thats about it. Crowd at lunch is mostly stuffy business people who probably expense it anyway."}
{"text":"Love the food, and great atmosphere. Book a seat at the chef's table to watch the magic at work, and enjoy outstanding service."}
{"text":"Richmond Station was good. It was good in the way that you leave satisfied, but you don't need to go back. My girlfriend and I shared four appetizers. In order of goodness to meh, they were: lamb croquettes, polenta fries, beef carpaccio and duck lettuce wraps. 

The first two were very tasty, crispy to my liking and pleased the taste buds. The beef was mediocre and could have done with a bit more flavouring. I was shocked at how bad the duck lettuce wraps were, from the lack of flavour right down to the abysmal amount of meat that was inside. The most prominent part of these was the excretion of water as I bit into the lettuce. 

For dessert we had the Cracker Jack. The unique popcorn ice cream won me over. And the caramel soup, well...if I ever went back, that's what I would have in place of the duck."}
{"text":"Dinner here was just perfection! We are visiting Toronto, and ate here the first night of our vacation. Everything about the experience was exquisite. The appetizers (we had polenta fries, raw oysters, chilled corn soup) were delicious. And the main meal -- out of this world (my husband had lamb; I ordered halibut). My husband could not stop raving about the incredible service -- and how well-ordered everything ran. I could go on and on (especially about the coconut tart!). But suffice to say, I HIGHLY recommend a dinner here."}
{"text":"The food was really good and the service was great. We sat at the chefs table and got to see the staff at work which was fun and they also interacted with us which was nice."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. Everything about my meal here was perfection. Service was so customer focussed. The food was innovative, beautifully presented, seasonal and delicious. The restaurant just feels nice too - the ambience feels like you're somewhere else. Love it here."}

Oh how I read so many reviews and tweets raving about this restaurant. But now, I am a little smarter than how I was about a year ago.
I now wait couple months until the craziness dies down and people start to spill out real honest opinions, no crazy bandwagoners there.

Anyways, I waited long enough for Richmond Station and the overall opinions seemed to be great. Also, it wasn't too crazy fancy of a restaurant which could burn a hole in my wallet! I like that.

It was back in December on a wednesday night I decided to drop by with a friend to check out Richmond Station. I called ahead and made reservation because you know how it gets with restaurants in downtown, especially near financial district.

Ordered: Charcuterie 3/5

* 4 different types of charcuterie served with bread for $14
* I didn't find their charcuterie plate to be anything special
* For the price, it is quite decent to order as a side with wine
* I personally really liked the presskopf croquette which are the little fried balls
* Pickled onions are a nice touch when you eat it with bread

Ordered: Polenta Fries 2/5

* 7~8 pieces of polenta fries for $7
* Served with bomba mayo and marinara sauce for dipping
* It seemed like everyone was ordering these and saying how good they are so I had to try it
* Personally I didn't really like it and failed to see the merit of it
* It's basically corn meal squished and shaped/fried like fries
* I just couldn't see what was so good about it, it tasted like deep fried corn muffin to me

Ordered: Flank Steak Frites 5/5

* Steak served with pommes kennedy for $24
* This was on specials that night and I was so glad I ordered it
* I wasn't asked how I wanted the steak done but it came medium rare just the way I like it
* Steak was decent but what made this dish amazing was the brown butter hollandaise sauce
* Brown butter hollandaise sauce tasted like heaven! it was like eating theatre popcorn, but without the corn 
* I really liked pommes kennedy as well, crispy just the way I like it

Ordered: Burger 4/5

* Served with aged cheddar, beet chutney, rosemary fries and radish salad for $20
* I expected burger just like the one from Marben and that's what I got
* Juicy burger with not much condiments added on, solely depending on the quality of the patty
* Bun was soft and it soaked up the beet chutney which added nice sweetness to the burger
* Rosemary fries are very thin just like shoe string fries and very crispy


Ordered: Profiteroles & Chocolate Cake 2/5

* They were both $9 and I didn't really like either of them
* Both of the desserts weren't very sweet and the pine needle reduction was a little too grassy and strong for my taste

Summary: Overall I really enjoyed my meal at Richmond Station. The restaurant is a lot bigger than I expected and it has a nice, more so laid back atmosphere.
It's a nice place to go for wine or dinner, you know you can trust the food to be solid and the service won't fluctuate that much. 
Price point is fairly good for the quality food they serve especially in downtown. 
Although on a side note, I was seated at 'chefs table' which is basically a table facing the open kitchen- as I finished my meal and was waiting for dessert, guy that was making the burger dropped one of the buns on the floor after toasting it. 
He didn't think anyone saw and went on to use it! Perhaps I should've said something right away but honestly I was just so shocked by what I saw and didn't know what to do.
This def makes me think about what goes on behind the closed kitchen.. when something like this occurs at a restaurant at Richmond Station. Something to think about!"}
{"text":"Our first visit was on a Saturday. It was my dad's birthday, and we wanted to find some place classy as well as unique, Richmond Station was just the perfect fit with its local-grown ingredients and inspiring whole animal menu!
We both ordered the Saturday brunch special, slow roast chicken breast. The cut was placed in the oven and cooked on low heat overnight. And let me be honest with you, it was the BEST piece of chicken breast I've ever tasted!! It was tender, juicy, with just the right amount of seasoning that brings out the flavour of the meat without overpowering it. My only complaint is that the portion of the sides (veggies&fries) were way too small: I was only half way through my chicken when the sides were all gone! Had to get additional side fries, which, albeit was delicious, did cost me an additional 15 minutes plus a $5 on bill :(
We also tried the polenta fries for appetizer, it was okay, not bad but sorta forgettable. Already filled by the end of the meal so we skipped dessert (plus the dessert menu WAS kind of uninspiring:p)
Another thing worth mentioning was during the Taste of Toronto, I had the chance to try the famous Station burger (saw a lot of people ordering it during my last visit), and I was surprise to find that I didn't enjoy it one bit. It was simply too sweet for my liking, so a definite no-go for those who don't like their meat sweet:p
Overall my experience with Richmond station has been really positive, and I would definitely like to return sometime to try out the daily inspiration menu!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant. The food was very tasty and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Had the tasting menu, which is basically everything they have on their specials menu. The experience took about 2 hours, which was expected but I was not feeling the dishes that much. Throughout the entire time, I wondered if we should have just gotten the burger instead. The dishes were creative and unique but not as tasty as I was hoping. The atmosphere was great and the servers were always asking if we liked the dishes and even tried to make it up with another dish. So my best advice is, if you're thinking about getting the tasting menu, look at the specials and see if the items sound good before committing."}
{"text":"Richmond Station is a really refreshing change from most other restaurants in the downtown core. They serve up rustic high-end Canadian food and they do it really, really well. Plus, the servers are really down-to-earth (and attentive!).

We went for their tasting menu on Friday night and had an amazing meal. It was $60 per person, and they even offer it for just two people.

What was included:
-Oysters (sauces all made in house)
-Charcuterie (six varieties)
-Scallop crudo tostadas
-Bread with oil (not your typical olive-oil-balsamic, it had a strong maple flavour that was really delicious).
-Poached perch with spatzle and spinach puree (the only miss of the night)
-Roasted beef (amazing)
-Dessert was a bunch of different things, including their ice cream which was awesome

We will definitely be back.

Tips:
-They have a really nice separate room that I'm sure you could book if you had a group of 8.
-Otherwise, when you make your reservation, ask to sit in the front room. Higher ceilings, just a better vibe.
-Make reservations at least two weeks in advance if you want to have dinner there on a weekend night (even more if you're picky about the time).
-Get the tasting menu! Remember to ask for it when you book your reservation (and tell them if you have any dietary issues)."}
{"text":"Eurobass Grenobloise - gnocchi was tender and light. Fish was a bit salty. Squash purée - didn't taste much of the squash, but it could have been bc the fish was too salty. 

Dessert - squash (?) cheesecake. It was good, except visually, was the intent to have it look like ramen with an egg?! Very curious plating. 

The service on the other hand - terrible! Didn't explain the chalkboard offerings and didn't seem very excited about the food or anything for that matter. Was tardy in checking up with us and such.

Overall - It was neither great nor terrible. Forgettable experience."}
{"text":"Ate here a few months ago with a friend. before getting on a flight out of the city. First thing I'll say was that the service was great. They immediately took our coats+bags and stored them for us, and when we said we had a timeline they were on top of ensuring everything came in time for us to make our flight, which I really appreciated.

The food was great, but the highlight was absolutely the Hawker Center, which was an asian-inspired dessert. The ingredients came across as an odd combo, but was executed incredibly."}
{"text":"We started our dinner with fresh PEI oysters and smoked trout hush puppies and a Pinot Gris from Prince Edward Island.  The lamb merguez pasta was amazing!  The service was excellent.  The staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Toronto downtown area.  Better to make reservations to ensure you get in on time.

The flavors are consistently good and so is the service"}
{"text":"Our experience here was positive in every way. Initially we attempted to make a reservation online, only to be disappointed with a very personal message from the hostess informing us that they were booked, but that they kept some high top tables available for walk-ins. Taking a chance, we walked in and were honoured to be seated at the chef's table, taking an opening before a larger party was scheduled to arrive. 
The food was absolutely excellent; the service was attentive and personable; the entertainment watching the choreography of the chef and servers from our seats was engaging; the pace was excellent, at no point rushed; the accommodations offered for our youngest member of the party (a six-year-old) demonstrates a true family- oriented approach. 
I'm so pleased we took a chance to walk in. 
We will return with concrete reservations, hopefully for the chef's table again."}
{"text":"Restaurant was recommended by our hotel...which would usually concern me, but after seeing the reviews on yelp, we decided to go for it and man, am I glad we did. We chose to do the tasting menu, with wine pairings, and each course was absolutely divine. Starting with oysters from New Brunswick, to the charcuterie plate, the brussels sprout salad, the smoked trout, the rib eye, and a dessert I can't even describe - each dish was better than the last. To top it off, our sommelier was awesome and we enjoyed the conversation around why she chose each and every glass....so much so that we asked her to write them down so that we could order some of the wines. We live outside of nyc, and this meal rivaled any we've had in the city."}
{"text":"Probably the best meal I've had in the last year, maybe 2. The approach that they've taken to quality at every stage of the meal is amazing. The attention to detail in their charcuterie... Unparalleled. The flavors in their carrot salad are exquisite. The pork-three-ways plate... Divine. The rye and rhubarb desert... Mind blowing. Get the hibiscus lemonade for some awesome flavors. Absolutely an awesome experience and worth every penny."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been my go-to for a nice dinner, since I luckily live very close by. The staff is lovely and knowledgeable.
The starters are all great sharing size - not skimpy and very reasonably priced. I love the cajun halibut cakes and can't wait to try the peking duck pancakes. The halibut entree is FANTASTIC, and when I ordered it, they were actually substituting the fish with black cod (aka sablefish) - what a treat! The butternut squash was incredibly silky and the spaetzle added a wonderful crunchy texture. 
I've also had the Braised Beef Ravioli which is I think my favourite pasta dish from a restaurant EVER (and I'm Italian!). There is so much to say about this dish, but I'll leave it to mystery and just say GO TRY IT.
I'm also a fan of the burger which is super popular here. One of the best burgers in the city in my opinion.
Overall I've never had a bad meal here and the service is great, I especially think the Hostess is really really great."}
{"text":"The outside of Richmond Station looks very hip and cute as it is shaped like a real subway station sign. It is fairly hidden as the entrance is small but love the gold doors. Once you get inside, the atmosphere is very hip and happening. It would be a great place to bring your date or just to relax with some friends. They have a wide selection of wine which is a nice variety. As for the food, this is where the A-OK comes to. We had the Scallion Polenta Fries, Duck Liver Pate and the Tuna Tartar. The portions are like tapas style. The tuna tartar was by far the best as it was the most refreshing but other than that, the food is mediocre. 
The service was good though, as the waiters take your order in a friendly manner and does not come every minute to check up on how you are doing. Overall, this is a good place to go when you are not too hungry and would just like to socialize and enjoy some wine and just snack on something."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. I have been here 3 times, and each time, the food is delicious and the service is so attentive. I have taken different people with me every time, and they have raved about the experience. The flavours in the various dishes are head and shoulders above similarly priced food in other restaurants. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It was amazing experience, I suggest to try the lobster pasta and especially mushroom ravioli. It was savory, creamy, and the entire plate had a whimsical texture to it. We came in at unusual hours of 4 pm to have lunch and service was on point. We also bought a jar of their own hot sauce, which we paired with oysters there. Worth the try!"}
{"text":"I had heard much good about this place. Had tried a couple of times to get a reservation but each time it was packed.

Tonight got a reservation for two. Table ready on time, great service off the top. We ended up with the specials of the day for both appetizers and mains.

It was terrific, and by Toronto standards, reasonably priced.

Will absolutely go again, I t is a bit noisy and close quarters but that is part of the energy of the place. Entirely enjoyable."}
{"text":"Came with some business colleagues.  Was a great lunch place that had a casual and inviting environment that encouraged conversation.  Interesting choices of food, portioned nicely for a substantive but not overwhelming meal.  For self, chose to go with two appetizers and had the roasted tomato soup with the lamb neck croquettes which made for an interesting and delicious combination.  Colleagues tried different plates and all left pleased.  
Recommend as a great and interesting lunch place (and likely dinner get together with friends)."}
{"text":"Amazing place!  had the rabbit & crackers, beet salad, trout + scallops...reminded me of one of my favorite places in Atlanta (Canoe)!  Definitely recommend, well worth the money!  Not very expensive, really, for the quality of food!"}
{"text":"Let's put it this way: I almost didn't write this review because frankly, I don't want the dining competition ;)

I experienced the 9 course tasting menu with a colleague last Wednesday, and it was a life changing event! Unpretentious & well-balanced, with generous portions. Despite it being busy, the knowledgeable staff was super friendly and patient. Very busy, so try to make reservations or be prepared to wait. Worth it. Oh and try their ciders, especially the wild fermented ones. 

Courses:
-oyster & trout 
-house made pates 
-polenta fries
-\"Caesar\" salad 
-Eurobass
-pierogi
-filet mignon
-cardamom ice cream crumble (a revelation)
-assorted chocolates"}
{"text":"The price is ok and the food quality is exceptional. Me and my friends enjoyed the meal a lot. I strong suggest you go with their daily special. It won't fail you."}
{"text":"Richmond station never disappoints! All the dishes I've had here all hit the spot. Tasty, quality food without the crazy high prices. Chef Carl Heinrich's burger is not to be missed of course but other dishes like the duck duo and mushroom soup are oh so gooood! 
Unfortunately, I've yet to have a dessert I love so done me, I stick with the food here. 
Oh, and their lunch fixed price menu is a great deal!"}
{"text":"Great little find we split dinners however the burger was by far the best burger I have ever tried what a great place!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite restaurant in the city. And fun fact - it's also owned by a former contestant of Top Chef Canada. The food definitely lives up to the title. But don't let the small menu online deceive you. There are always daily specials, so it's best to call in before to check what they first. We ordered the Jerk Scallop Ceviche (~$15), Mushroom Agnolotti (~$27) and Lemon Meringue Pie (~$10). My wife had the beet and goat cheese salad and said it was the best she ever had. This is a great place for a celebration, double date or group outing. But make sure whatever you do to book reservations in advance!"}
{"text":"I went to Richmond Station for dinner with a friend.  I requested for the chefs menu.  The restaurant was busy so the chef menu was not available.  The server told us to order a la carte then they will try to serve it like chefs menu. We ordered the charcuterie with 3 items,  half order of farmers ricotta, the roasted carrot salad, burger and duck. We were charged $140 for 2 $70 chef menu on the bill.  I went home and I realized I got ripped off by the waitress.  $15 + ($12)/2 + $19 + $22 + $28 =$90.  I would have been charged less if the waitress billed me the items individually."}
{"text":"Really great spot that I stumbled upon and decided to roll into, especially given its subdued entry way and contemporary/rustic look. Service was top notch--explanatory and courteous without pretension or intrusion. Met some cool locals and discovered some new wine. The cold corn soup they have is deviously yummy as are their salads. The lone veggie option, the ravioli was my main course choice and it didn't disappoint. But yeah---beyond solid spot. Check it out."}
{"text":"Really interesting and delicious food, very friendly and attentive servers who are very knowledgeable about food, but not pretentious. We ended up eating here twice during our three day visit. The first night we had a reservation made over a month in advance. The second night we dropped in at 8:30 and ate at the bar. Both nights were yummy and bustling."}
{"text":"Generally speaking, when I look at menus like the one of Richmond Station, I'm generally not really impressed - the pricier mains just don't catch my eye. However, after coming here for a company lunch yesterday, I was pleasantly surprised by the amazing quality and execution of food! The service was also top notch; the waitress was so polite and friendly!

We were seated in this semi-private area that functioned as their pantry. I saw a chef come in at some point for more ingredients! The charcuterie was also hanging in the cold room.

We started off with some shared apps for the table, and ordered the following.

Charcuterie Board:
We ordered the six piece assortment; the waiter had explained all of them in detail, but the specifics have escaped me! I did really like the large pale pink round piece that resembled ham or bologna, as well as the prosciutto like pieces. The pickled vegetables was also a nice addition, though I felt they could have given more.

Quinoa Salad:
This was well loved by the group, but it wasn't my favourite. That said, it may be because I've never been a huge fan of quinoa. The taste was good, and the contrasting textures interesting, but I found that it paled in comparison when placed beside the Baby Gem Salad.

Cucumber Salad:
This dish was subtly refreshing, due to the cucumbers and addition of dill. That said, I did find the dressing a little on the heavy side, though I couldn't quite peg down what ingredient contributed to this. Perhaps it was the fresco or the tzatziki. However, my colleagues all loved this salad and claimed it was the best one.

Baby Gem Salad:
This take on the Caesar salad stole the show for me. The briny, fishy taste of the anchovies highlighted the saltiness of the egg yolks and parmigiano. The smoked almonds added a nice crunch, and I could swear that they were slightly sugared. Definitely my favourite, and I'm not usually a fan of the classic Caesar salads. Maybe I'm just a huge fan of anchovies, as I'm definitely seeing a trend in my preferred dishes...

White Asparagus and Baby Ham:
Approximately 6 pieces of asparagus came topped with three pieces of ham/bacon. Apart from the fact that the asparagus was white, I didn't find this dish particularly interesting. The shoots were sweet, and the ham was a nice salty contrast, but overall it wasn't a memorable dish for me. I personally found it overpriced, but the selling point for the table was its white colour.

I also ordered a hibiscus lemonade, which was refreshing. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish it as I did find it on the sweet side. The citrus lemonade paired really well with the added floral syrup, and received praises all around the table.

For the main, I ordered the cod, but was able to try a bit of the flavour of the duck accompaniments.

Slow Cooked Black Cod:
Since cod is known for its fatty rich flavour, I was really interested to see how this restaurant would cook this fish. I've only ever had it at Japanese restaurants, where it's grilled with miso and kept relatively dry and sauce free. I was therefore really surprised to see Richmond Station serve the cod with tomato salsa, basil, and the red pepper rouille, but the combination made sense to me right away. Since the cod is so fatty, it seems logical to add some tangy tomato and light spices to brighten up the flavour. 
The cod was grilled perfectly! It was flaky, moist, succulent, and tender. The outside, however, was crispy and delicious. There was a bit of fat stuck the skin, and that made everything more awesome! Since I'm a purist in flavour, I really enjoyed eating the fat fish alone... But felt very full and stuffed soon afterwards from all the oil and fats. Perhaps it would have been smarter to eat the fish with all the salsa and rouille, as was intended. 
That said, though I was impressed with the fish, I was surprised that it was paired with so many beans. The red pepper added a delightful spicy kick and was great with the sourdough, but I found it to overpower the taste of the fish (partially the reason why I opted out of eating them together). I did, however, enjoy the fish with the pairing of fresh roasted cherry tomatoes and asparagus!

Duck Two Ways:
A colleague of mine ordered this dish, and I was able to try a fiddlehead with the grains and jus. Maybe it was because I was too full, but I found the dish on the heavy side. In fact, my colleague said the very same and had difficulty finishing his dish after the appetizers. The fiddlehead had a grassy, green flavour, and retained its crisp, providing an interest contrast to the rest of the dish. I much preferred my cod, which was comparatively lighter!

By the end of the meal, we were so stuffed that we couldn't even order dessert. That said, one party member who came late (and thus didn't get to share in the appetizers) didn't find the cod filling enough. Overall, Richmond Station is slightly pricey, but it's a decent mid-budget first date or business lunch place."}
{"text":"We really wanted to go to a fancy restaurant and get dressed up while we were at Toronto and decided on Richmond Station.


Although the environment was very nice and the staff was super accommodating. The food was equally excellent! 

I don't really remember what I got because we ate so much in Toronto but I just remember leaving here happy, full and bougie."}
{"text":"Was hands down the best restaurant experience I had in Toronto and one of the best I've ever had. Sat at the chef's bar, where you can peer into the kitchen and watch their every move. Started with a Charcuterie board and a hummus salad, absolutely delicious selection of meats and cheeses and the housemade bread was great too. I ordered the Lobster Capellini and my companion had the scallops. The lobster was hands down of the best pastas Ive ever had as they managed to infuse a ton of lobster flavour into the sauce. The scallops were done quite well but I'm not personally a fan of having scallops as an entree. we finished with a hazelnut torte and an almond torte, Plated beautifully and served deconstructed style. The desserts were a bit too dry for my liking and the mousse was very dry but I think that's what they were going for. all in all though, a great dining experience."}
{"text":"The beef duo is amazing~ especially the tender beef shank and the hollandaise sauce!"}
{"text":"I have to say I really don't understand the hype about this restaurant. I'll rate the food as 4 stars, but unfortunately the service brought it down to 3 stars.

I tried to make a reservation the day before our outing and no one ever picked up the phone. I believe I called about 5 times over the duration of an hour. Please tell me what is the point of having a phone if no one will be there to answer it. If the bad ended right here, I would still rate the restaurant as 4 stars, unfortunately it got worst. 

After my partner and I were seated, the server practically neglected us for 10 minutes. She never came around to ask for our drink order AND she didn't introduce the specials. It was our first time at the restaurant, so we didn't know the specials were written on the chalk board that is out of our line of sight until the couples beside us talked about it. In the end, we just decided to flag down another server to take our orders. (Our server was chatting up a storm with someone sitting at the bar, she didn't even realize we already had our appetizers when she finally decided to come take our order) 

Food was very innovative. We shared a warm salad and the polenta fries. For the main course, the braised beef ravioli was amazing and the special scallops had a unique flavor. 

Overall, food was good, service is below average. Not sure if we will visit again."}
{"text":"Bad weather, thats ok staying in the city anyway. 

Decide to come walk over to Richmond Station see what all the fuss is about. 

No reservation, thats ok. 15 minute wait. 

Nice friendly staff. Nice ambiance, if not a little loud. Small space in front, a little larger up top. I felt a little crowded, wasn't really interested in hearing the woman beside me story of failed love. 

Nice Manhattan to start.  First version was whiskey even though I had asked for bourbon. No worries, bartender made another

Nice white Chardonnay with dinner. 

Started with beautiful fresh oysters followed by Roasted Black Cod. 

Food was fantastic, one of the best meals in a while. 

Definitely go back to try other items in the menu. I hear the burger is the best."}
{"text":"It took me a few tries to finally get seats, but when I finally did, I was really impressed! This contemporary, Canadian-style restaurant had a lot of hits and very few misses (that stupid trout tartare...) 

I particularly enjoyed their Braised Beef Ravioli. It was super rich and savoury but with the necessary balancing touches that kept it from being too much. Their dessert was plated beautifully too!

When I go back (I definitely will!) I'm going to be trying their duck and their burger, which the people next to my table ordered. It looked even more delicious! 

Their service was pretty outstanding -- our waitress joked with us jovially throughout our meal and they even split our shared main into two plates before serving it to us! It was a nice touch.

For more details and pictures, feel free to take a look at my food blog, which is located on my Yelp profile page. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Recently wanted a place to have dinner with a large group (13 people). Richmond Station politely accepted our request and took a reservation on a busy Saturday night in July. Couldn't have been happier with it - the servers were quick and polite and the food was amazing. Very fair price for the quality of food and excellent atmosphere."}
{"text":"Classic example of when Yelp gets it right. How does a restaurant get a 4.5 star rating with almost 500 reviews, you ask? Don't ask, just come and taste it for yourself. Tried out their tasting menu at the chef's table. So filling and incredibly tasty. Note: don't need to sit at the chef's table to request the tasting menu. 

We didn't get to try the burger but saw it being made. Looked amazing. We asked the waiter about it and he mentioned that it's the most popular dish. For those Toronto Burger enthusiasts, the chef here previously worked at Marben so the burgers are quite similar in style and taste to Marben's. Oh, and did I also mention that this chef won Top Chef Canada? Have I sold you yet?"}
{"text":"Dined at Richmond Station recently and was lucky enough to get a seat with center view into the kitchen. We were so close to the chefs in action, we easily felt the heat from the stove! It was like dinner and a show, watching these brilliant chefs do their magic. With so many great choices, bf and I decided to do the tasting menu, and we were not disappointed. The service was great, our server was super friendly and approachable. They really know how to take care of you at Richmond Station! Would definitely return to try their famous burger."}
{"text":"Gorgeous restaurant. It's one of those places that you can go over and over again and still find the place quite quaint. Came by after work one day and was seated immediately on the bar/community table which I absolutely adore because you can see what everyone else is ordering and judge the dish from afar. 

We got two drinks (old fashioned and gin & tonic - with a refreshing spin) and a few side dishes. This place is good because they have new menus every now and then to keep things fresh but with that being said, not every dish is perfected. I actually came here because I wanted polenta fries but unfortunately it was no longer offered.

I would come back and try other items on their menu and because the atmosphere and servers were so great!"}
{"text":"Their delicious burgers and great service made our weekend! Our server was a very helpful and genuinely friendly lady, who explained to us that the restaurant gets the cows and pigs from a farm and breaks them down for their meat dishes. You can also buy organic meat from Richmond Station by signing up online."}
{"text":"Mediocre service, and great food! I got a reservation for 2 at the chef's table, on a Thursday night for 7:30. 

We ordered the mussels escabeche and duck liver pate to start. The mussels were good, but the pate really stole the show - the pate was light and fluffy, and creamy. For my main, I ordered the scallop daily special with a cauliflower purée, roasted cauliflower, curried chickpeas. The scallops were fresh and perfectly cooked. 

Both my friend and I agreed that the dessert really stole the show. We ordered the London Fog (earl grey ice cream, cheesecake, orange blossom jellies) to share and we almost had to order another one. It's honestly a must get!"}
{"text":"I went here today for my birthday, so this experience is still fresh in my mind. It was quite busy on this Friday evening, so we waited to be seated for our reservation. Let me first say that, in general, the food was very good; honestly, worthy of a 5 star review. I got the rabbit three ways, which satisfied my palate with its versatility in both flavour and texture. Very enjoyable. The rabbit paired well with the carrot purée, funnily enough. My sister said the station burger was the best she had ever had. 
Food-wise, they did well. However, the service is what tanked this experience. I may be being a bit nitpick-y, but I was not satisfied with how inattentive the waitstaff was (until, of course, the bill came and the waitress made sure to brood over our shoulders as we selected a custom tip). This place is on the pricier side, so I understand that there may be an expectation for larger tips. Although, I don't believe it is warranted. Unlike a few tables near us, we were not served bread prior to our meal. This was disappointing because the bread, which I noticed a waiter had been cutting only a meter away from our table, look pretty good. So close, yet so far.  My father also noticed that our water was being poured by the waitstaff, even though a jug of water had been provided on our table for self-serving. That's really just a minor detail, but still, a little uncouth. You may feel that I am being too harsh, but I standby my assessment. Great food, unsatisfactory service. Enjoyable atmosphere though; I'll give them that. I liked the transportation theme. Maybe it was just an off night for them."}
{"text":"We had a great meal here.  The menu is short and well planned.  The service great.  We ordered the charcuterie, but changed it to the salami tray after four indirect suggestions by our waiter.  The halibut was great, as was the venison.  Great place to people watch."}
{"text":"Very nice service!! Very nice food!! Similar to what I have in Hong Kong, Fusion is my favour. But compare with the restaurant called yard bird in HK. I think yard bird won by 2 points. LOL! But still amazing."}
{"text":"Love the food I had, the rabbit two way and the dessert were both amazing. The rabbit dish had many layers of flavor, but they all work perfectly together. Their menu seems to update pretty frequently though, I was craving for ducks as I read several previous reviews, but then there were no duck dish when I went. Anyhow, the meal still came out to be amazing."}
{"text":"I came here for my quest to find Toronto's best burger.  It was bomb!!! This review is just for the burger. Was it the best in Toronto? Nah. The bun was soft and even had a buttery taste to it. The perfect bun that doesn't overpower the patty and the rest of the ingredients. Loved the contrasting flavour of the beets. Good cheese. Great, juicy patty; despite me asking for it to be well done. Overall great burger. Good quantity for the fries. The fries were decent in taste and the horseradish jalapeño side sauce that they had was a pass from me. We also ordered a dessert which gets A on presentation but B- on taste."}
{"text":"This place is a MUST GO!  We were able to secure 2 seats at 9:30pm on a Friday. We called first and we're pleasantly surprised. We ordered a charcuterie board w cheese. $30 Canadian and worth every penny. We had one plate from the menu (coconut curry scallops) - perfectly cooked. The other plate was a special - pork 3 ways. It melted in your mouth. 
Definitely worth a stop - get reservations."}
{"text":"*Opera clap*

In most restaurants, there is a \"right choice\" in terms of the dishes to order. Richmond Station is a rare case where I would have full blind faith in ordering anything off the menu. 

From the regular menu we had the Fried Sunchokes, the Eurobass, and the London Fog. Each dish was exquisitely composed. My friend and I both observed that every ingredient, sauce, and garnish was thought-out and added a vital extra dimension to the piece, so that I am tempted to make cheesy comparisons to a carefully executed orchestra. (The London Fog in particular was close-your-eyes-to-your-happy-place good.)

We also ordered two things from the chalkboard: the sirloin special, which was fantastic, and the Chincharron. The Chincharron was a (very big) miss with both my friend and me, BUT, more importantly, the staff saw that we didn't finish the dish, asked if there was something wrong, and took it off the bill without being asked, so that overall I was left with confidence in having a thoroughly positive experience here every time.

Prices are typical per dish (in the $20s-30s for mains), though portions tend to be dainty. Ambiance was personal but casual; lighting was not dim enough to hide imperfections, and you may well be sharing conversation space with other diners - but for a place to catch up with a friend and have a truly amazing meal, I couldn't imagine better.

I hope to be back, and often, looking forward to trying the other menu items!"}
{"text":"I went for dinner and drinks here on a Monday night after hearing good reviews from friends. Definitely recommend a traditional table in the front room. The host and wait staff were very professional.

The Station Sparkler was a well-balanced apéritif. We enjoyed this mix with the charcuterie board. It was a good starter for sharing. A nice selection of cured meats and mild cheeses with well-flavoured preserves. 

The agnolotti was a comforting choice with rustic sweet potatoes, parsnips, and roasted almonds.

While the glazed turnips, sweet potato pavé, parsnip purée sides were delicious and complimentary, the duck main was not. I wouldn't recommend this plate.

Richmond Station is a hidden gem that I'll try again soon. I like how seasonal the menu is."}
{"text":"I have been to Richmond Station more than a dozen times and have yet to be disappointed. The burger with quinoa salad and a glass of the rose hall run Chardonnay are a perfect lunch combo. The service is attentive and provides knowledgeable recommendations on menu or beverage choices. It can be quite busy at lunch so best to make a booking."}
{"text":"Everything we tasted was amazing! From the Niagara Ice drinks to the chocolate bar dessert. You can really see that the dishes have carefully thought ingredient combinations. The duck liver pate is a killer choice!"}
{"text":"Had:

Polenta fries
Charcuterie 
Lamb croquette

#mouthgasm #toogoodiwannadie #wherehasthisplacebeenallmylife #nohashtagtoexplainhowgood

O.m.g. Seriously stop reading and go eat here. 

Lamb croquette not really worth it but the Charcuterie and Polenta fries alone...

I'm so sad really....almost in depression over the fact I'm not there right now...

Bit hard to spot but it's right under a forest conservation type building and beside a parking garage.!"}
{"text":"An intimate gastropub with a creative (albeit limited) menu. Everyone here seems to take their food seriously, which pays off in the form off very memorable dishes.

Chicharrónes: A gourmet pork rind. A lot fresher than the kind from the supermarket. Light and pillowy like a cheese puff. All the spices and sauce made it extra special.

Rabbit Two Ways: The roast rabbit leg was amazingly tender and packed with light gamey goodness. The deep fried rabbit square was just ok. It seemed like a lot of shredded dark meat which was much dryer than the roast leg. Lots of fun veggies and sauces, I especially appreciated the lardons."}
{"text":"Man!!  I had the trout crudo, polenta fries, station burger, and the agnolotti.  While the first two were good and nothing crazy, the station burger along with the fries and dip kicked ass and the agnolotti made me rethink my life up until that point.  I cannot wait to come back to Toronto to have this again."}
{"text":"First off - save room for dessert!  This is where they excelled, IMO.  We ordered all 4 (they change their menu seasonally), and alll were delicious and 3 of 4 were fairly unique.  

Went for a business lunch, in the semi-private room.  This part of the experience almost made me go with a different restaurant, and would have if wasn't for me not having yet tried it, and it being one of my colleague's favourite restaurants.  Review would've been 4 stars if wasn't for this.  Tried to book a party of 6 from noon to 2 and was told there's a min. spend of $600, and that a set menu would be enforced (despite their website stating set menu restrictions set in for parties of 12 or more).  After a number of emails, they did agree to a min. spend of $300 and no set menu restrictions, but the process to get there was what really grinded my gears.  It took me asking if the min spend was because my reservation request spanned more than one seating (it did, which was revised thus lowering the min spend).  The set menu rationale was that it's the busiest time of lunch service so it was to ensure timely service.  I had to point out that a party of 6 is not considered a large party by typical standards, and a non-private room party of 6 (with no min spend) wouldn't have this restriction imposed on them, so why should we, when we're paying more?  None of this info was offered to me, that I had to be the instigator to ask the questions wasn't exactly customer friendly, and made it feel as though they couldn't care less if they had our business.  Their regular front of house manager was on leave over this period so hopefully this was not the normal course.  

Now the food.  Had a french onion soup (decent) and the mushroom agnolotti (good, albeit on the salty side).  Now back to the desserts - beautifully presented and absolutely amazing, especially the Hawker Centre and London Fog.  Seriously, SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT.  Price is fair.  Service was very friendly and informed, although on the slow side (took a long time to clear dirty dishes/coming back for food orders after wine orders went in/enquiring on desserts after mains were finished), but the server's enthusiasm more than made up for it.

Given all the excellent reviews, I'd likely go back some time and give it another try - minus the hassle of reserving the private room."}
{"text":"So I've been back twice now, once for my birthday and once just as a walk-in for lunch.  I'm a little disappointed, and my last experience was the worst, so I have to give a lower rating.  My birthday dinner was pretty good, I ordered the rabbit 3 ways.  I've never had rabbit before and this dish, though not perfect, made me a fan.  I forget what my boyfriend had but it wasn't great.  Dessert was pretty tasty this time, a brownie with squid ink ice cream, salty sweet goodness.  Unfortunately my lunch experience was kinda gross.  I ordered 6 oysters on the half shell to start as a splurge because I recently decided oysters are my favourite things ever, bar none.  Unfortunately they didn't have a nice flavour and seemed kinda dried out, so I'm not sure if they had turned slightly or if they just don't know how to pick oysters properly.  I have yet to find a restaurant who serves up oysters as good as Oyster Boy.  Sadly.  I also ordered the daily special which was duck confit.  The duck was delicious, I've had duck here before and both times has been perfectly cooked.  In fact, the cook on this duck confit was divine, perfectly crisp, all fat rendered, and tender tender meat.  Unfortunately the dish lacked the same elegance as the first time as the accompaniments were poorly flavoured.  Obviously you need some strong flavours to go with duck confit, but the lentils were overpowered by too mcuh horseradish, and needed something sweet to balance.  I think the carrot puree was meant as that something sweet, but really didn't hold up to any of the bolder flavours of the dish and was just kinda there for colour?  I will be back, but with a little less enthusiasm."}
{"text":"I really don't get the fuss about this place. 

Came in for lunch and everything was at least $23, even the burgers. 

I don't mind paying over well over $35 per lunch dish at the The Four Seasons or Bymark but this is neither.

I suspect this place is for Tourists after eaton centre shopping or yuppies from the office towers. Possibly wealthy hippies from Queen west :-O 

Food and service was good thou I will give them that although this is no Michelin Star or luxury hotel... I found the prices insulting, but maybe this is the new Toronto thing!"}
{"text":"Great fresh food with creative flavors. Highly recommend!  Loved the quinoa salad!  Scallops were melt-in-your mouth perfection. Service was extremely friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Came here on a busy weekday where the lunchtime crowd packed the place up. The gracious hostess sat me at the chef's table where I had a very interesting lunch conversation with a government attorney. I was very impressed with the attentive and friendly staff. 5 stars to them. I tried the polenta fries and the trout that was recommended by a regular. Love the presentation and the creativeness behind these. However, I find both of them a tad too salty for my taste. Other than that, everything was just great."}
{"text":"A really really great meal. I booked this place after reading such great reviews on Yelp and i can confirm, the food here is real good. 

This place is clearly very popular as the only table we could get was at 4.45pm on a Thursday. The atmosphere was relaxed and comfortable. It really started picking up by the time we left around 6.30pm. 

The staff are really attentive and talk you through each dish when it arrives which is a nice touch. They even made espresso martinis at our request which weren't on the menu!
 
On to the food: we shared the charcuterie board to start. The deep fried pulled pork bites were the highlight but also the dipping oil for the bread is real tasty too. 

I had the station burger for the main and it's was delightful! Super juicy and the all the flavour combined work so well.

My BF had the steak special. Whilst he enjoyed I think he had slight regret at not getting the burger. However, again all the different flavours and textures worked perfect together. 

Dessert was the highlight for me. As a Brit, naturally I had to have the London Fog. It was truly fantastic. It's a white chocolate cheesecake with these drops of an orange sauce, topped with earl grey ice cream. If you go, just have it. 

I would definitely recommend this place to any friends visiting Toronto. But book early!"}
{"text":"Fairly expensive for the quality of food (and portions) you receive. Seating was quick but it took a while for the food to come out. There are much better places downtown to eat for these prices."}
{"text":"Great food and genuine staff take this excellent atmosphere to a new level.  Thought to get into but always worth the wait.  Try the chefs counter."}
{"text":"Best burger ever...and I'm not even a burger fan. We started off with the polenta fries and moved on to the main entrees. The fries were nice but I think there are other great appetizers to try there. The rabbit was succulent and their signature burger was the best!"}
{"text":"This place has a very cool vibe. They were pretty booked on a Friday night. The food is excellent, but there's not a huge menu selection. The best things we had were actually our appetizers. The 'Rabbit and Crackers' is a must have! So tasty!"}
{"text":"Fantastic adventure for foodies in Toronto. We had a heck of a time getting there due to traffic and construction in downtown Toronto, but it was well worth it. Great friendly service from Teddy and Nancy; interesting but satisfying dishes; haute hipster ambiance. We had the trout crostini for an appetizer. Delicious. We shared the large tomato arugula salad, which was seriously the best tomatoes I have ever had in a perfectly executed salad. Frank is plotting to duplicate the roasted red pepper vinaigrette. Everything was fantastic. For dessert, I ordered a chocolate torte, but then we were presented with a complimentary birthday dessert for Frank containing things that weren't even on the menu (lemon sorbet, chocolate bread pudding, white chocolate ganache, homemade marshmallows, hazelnuts). We split it and my dessert never arrived, but appeared on the bill. We decided to pay for it anyway, feeling that we were well ahead on the deal. Go here."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Right in the heart of the city. With farm to table presentation. The sliders were excellent along with the fish."}
{"text":"What a good value!  Terrific to find a casual restaurant with excellent food!  We had scallops that were perfect!  Eurobass also amazing!!  Must have a good saucier, sauces were amazing!  Caesar type salad to start was also really really good with brussel sprouts.  We sat watching the kitchen and loved all the different people that popped around the corner with our plates.  Dinner with mains and starters, 1 drinks was about $50 pp which is really a great value for the quality.  Will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food, great service! Can't recommend this place enough. Been here twice. Every time exceeds expectations."}
{"text":"Excellent attentive service, superb appetizers - lamb's neck croquettes with hummus and tzatsiki and masala duck tacos with raita. I liked the lamb merguez orecchiette but I asked for it to be spicy and it came out a bit tart for my taste - I suspect the extra, pickled chilli peppers were the perpetrators. Casual hip vibe with individual and communal tables and a nice buzz in the house even at 10:15 pm. Signage looks like signage for the subway entrance - which is cool, but it took me a minute or two to spot it."}
{"text":"Appetizers and desserts are more outstanding than the mains
Recommend: duck confit lettuce wraps. Duck is tender and perfectly cooked. Combined with kimchi the course was very delicious.
Lamb neck croquettes! My favorite dish so far! So refreshing with the tzatziki sauce and tomatoes.
Coconut cream tart(dessert) was awesome. Not too sweet. (If only the portion is larger)
Stn. Burger was okay
Great ambiance!"}
{"text":"Very small restaurant tucked away on Richmond, but the choice of food was very tasty. Had a lentil soup and mushroom fettuccine and it was very tasty and filling. Fresh ingredients and not so heavy appetizers makes it a great place for get togethers. Seating is small so you'll have to make reservations. Would give it 5 stars but I haven't tried and of the meat dishes yet. Service was great, little bit of a wait but it was worth it. A bit of a hipster place."}
{"text":"I go out to eat once in a while, can't call myself a real foodie but I love to cook and I watch a lot of food network.  

That being said this has got to be the best restaurant I've ever been to in Toronto.  I sat at the seats that are looking into the kitchen and it was a blast watching the very efficient way they prepare the food and turn a simple white empty plate into a masterpiece.

Not only was the look good, the taste was amazing too and with entrees under $30, I would call this place very cheap for the value you get out of the food.

The chalk menu has some fresh options as well which is neat.  I like how their normal menu was not too long which means they can concentrate on what they do well.

Great job and I can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"What a delightful find. 

Although the restaurant was absolutely rammed last night, they still made sure to accommodate our last minute request. I dined on polenta fries and one of their daily specials (a duo beef dish which was unbelievable).

I also tried my friends eggplant app which was equally amazing. 

The atmosphere is bustling with a high bar for the casual diner and then tables for a more formal sit down. The service was exceptional. 

Can't say enough great things about this place."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars

Another Great burger. Probably ranks # 3 for me, just behind Marben and the current champ - \"The Harbord Room\".

Been a few times lately and the service is professional and efficient. That said, I do feel the service can be somewhat cold, but not necessarily in a negative way (hard to explain).  

You can usually get a lunch table between 1-3pm without a reservation if your in a party of two or three. They have both Bar, communal table and general table seating.

I mainly come for the burger. Its cooked a perfect medium to medium rare. The milk bun is a star in this dish, really adds flavour to the burger and never gets soggy. Toppings include beet chutney (Yum) and aged cheddar. The burger patty consists of two parts - brasided beef in the middle and then wrapped with ground beef. You get two different textures when you bite it - simply delicious.

I also tried the home-made perogies which were OK, but had much better. Not sure I would recommend them or try again.

They usualy have 3-4 craft beers on tap (bonus) and a full selection of wines.  

PS - check the chalk boards, they often have interesting daily specials. Usually a 3 course fixed meal.

Safe to say I will be back.

{"text":"My girlfriend and I absolutely love this restaurant. Our first visit had us craving for a return and we finally got back to it tonight. This time we sat in the area near the kitchen and had an awesome view of the kitchen in action. The ambience was awesome. Despite being in the room with a bunch of strangers we felt like everyone wouldn't hesitate to start a friendly conversation. It's really is hard to describe how homely it felt.

Next, the service. Damn, the wait staff has it nailed down. Throughout the evening we spoke with 2-3 waiters and waitresses with along with our primary waiter. Nothing obtrusive, nothing overbearing, just a great bunch of people making sure our waters were topped up, our cutlery was fresh, and most importantly; that we knew what we were ordering (neither of us are very culinary literate) and that it met expectations. 

Lastly, the food. One word. Incredible. Cooked and prepared perfectly, appealing, and great tasting. These guys/girls have something special here. Everything works perfectly together. Fresh, local meats, fresh greens. I could go on but seriously, do yourself a favour and eat here. Desserts are top notch and coffees/cappuccinos are a perfect way to end an excellent meal. Even after two starters, a main, dessert, and a cappuccino, neither of us felt bloated or stuffed. It was the perfect amount of food to get you to that \"I'm perfectly full\" point. Definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"Super restaurant.

Top notch tapas style for sharing, mains and desserts...what else do you expect from Top Chef Canada winner Carl Heinrich!!

Had variety of tacos, wings, coq Au vin, burgers, fries and poached pear dessert 

Even took a tour and photo with Carl..priceless!!!"}
{"text":"This place is hard to access at a decent time as the reservations on a short notice even on weekdays were not available. Kind of makes sense as the location is central, though the place is hard to spot unless you know where it is (I have walked by this street far too many times in my years here but still don't recall what was in this spot before they opened) 
Anyway their claim to fame is the burger and desserts so with a friend in tow we got an early reservation. When one walks in it seems like a small place but there is plenty of seating upstairs and in the duration we were there the place was mostly empty so maybe it gets packed later on when people get off work.
Anyway on to the burger its cooked medium so the beef is fresh. A bit on the smaller size they have got the meat to bun ratio spot on. The seasoning was a bit off somehow and I think the meat could have used with a little more fat. I have had similar version of a burger at the now defunct Cafe Boulud  in Vancouver which was a lot better. The fries were quite good and outshine the main IMO. For the burger I would say one of the better ones in downtown core.  3.5 stars.
Now on to the dessert we shared the saffron pudding and the blueberry mousse dessert (special for that day) Visual appeal is high on both items.
Now for the taste, saffron pudding itself was OK the rose water ice cream and the dried raspberries overwhelmed everything else on this dessert.
Blueberry mousse didn't fare well as I wasn't sure what I was having. The ice cream had hints of corn and corn bread added to the corniness! but the mousse itself could have been just blended blueberries. 2 Stars for dessert."}
{"text":"Tasting menu review. 

I recommend reserving a seat at the \"chef's table\".... its basically a long bar table with a view into kitchen. It was a great experience watching the chefs at work. 

The tasting menu is great value. It's $65pp, and came with 7 or 8 \"courses\", 1 of which was a dessert. It wasn't the best or most creative tasting menu that I've had, but I didn't expect that at this price point. There were a few dishes in particular that we really enjoyed (side stripe shrimp, salmon that was cooked perfectly, and venison to name a few). 

I liked the atmosphere as well. It's fairly casual, which I always appreciate.

We saw a lot of burgers being prepared in the kitchen... I'll try one of those on my next visit. The duck seemed to be popular too."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here in this small but bustling restaurant! Everything on the menu is unique and mouth-watering--you can tell the chef tries to spice everything up a bit, even your typical salad or steak dish. I had the pleasure of trying their pork and \"Rabbit Two Ways\", both which were tender, juicy, and bursting with flavour. The sides they are served with add an interesting twist to the overall flavour of the dish and give your tastebuds something to think about.

What impressed me most were actually their appetizers and desserts--their mushroom salad special is amazing, and their \"Hawkins Centre\" dessert is probably my favourite dessert dish this year!!

Service was excellent and the overall atmosphere was very pleasant; I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Solid four stars.

Unpretentious, casual feel for a restaurant.  However, the food is cooked with attention to detail and taste.

Appetizers:  

Lobster patatas bravas was slightly overcooked.  I still enjoyed it.  The portion was a tad on the smaller side.  

House made soft cheese served with crostinis.  Very smooth in texture.  I wished the serving was a bit larger on this one too.

We were all gushing over the chicken wings which had varying levels of flavours.  Sweet, spicy, savoury...  Delicious.  We wanted more because it tasted so good!  The appetizer portion was just right.

For our mains:

Our table tried two fish dishes and stuffed ravioli.  The crispy crust on the sea bream was impressive.  That really stood out for me.  The crunch reminded me of the bread on a grilled cheese sandwich.  Portions were quite large and we all felt satisfied.  

The desserts were amazing.  Molecular gastronomy done very well.  Different textures, flavours, consistencies,...  I'm not a dessert person but I would definitely order dessert here again.

Service was consistent and appropriate.  

Great meal with great friends!  Thanks for a wonderful night!"}
{"text":"I have difficulty remembering the details of my Richmond Station experience beyond the burger, but my burger was 5/5 delicious; a tender, medium rare concoction surrounded by tartness and sweetness and soft, warm roll that melted in my mouth and made my ever expanding stomach weep for joy. It probably took 5 years off my life, but a life without burger is no life at all."}
{"text":"Went for lunch after seeing reviews on yelp,  and the experience was phenomenal!  I would definitely recommend this restaurant.  Every dish we tried was great,  service was pleasant,  atmosphere also great! 
I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Just home from a great dinner at Richmond Station. I got reservation earlier today. Hostess was very accommodating. I asked for the end of the chef's table. Didn't think this was likely to happen given the short notice at which I made the reservation. I was pleasantly surprised as that's exactly where we got to sit. Came with my boyfriend. Would highly recommend sitting at the chef's table. I love watching the plating and  the general hustle and bustle of the kitchen. Our server made us feel very comfortable. He was attentive (his timing on everything was spot on). He was professional yet relaxed. Great combination. The food was so good. Every morsel was delicious. We had the duck pancakes to start. Then I had the Sourdough Crusted Euro Bass and my boyfriend had the Duck Ragu. To finish I had the Apple Mille Feuille for desert. Looked and tasted amazing. Our drinks were excellent too. Overall it was a great dining experience. Hats off to all the team at Richmond Station. You guys are doing an excellent job!"}
{"text":"One of be best in town for a reason! The menu is small and well articulated. You can't go wrong with anything. It's all going to blow your mind. The staff are very knowledgable and easy going. All good vibes!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try Richmond Station for a while; good reviews, pics looked good, lots of buzz.  I read all of the Yelp reviews beforehand, which was a good call, and looked at the pictures to see what I wanted to order.

Reservations and communication with the restaurant prior to the reservation were easy and efficient.  If you email their reservation email, someone actually writes you back, unlike a lot of restaurants (Hello, Harbord Room).  When we got there, the room was really full, considering it was 5:45 on a Tuesday --- very busy! So definitely make reservations.  The seats facing the open kitchen were really cool, bar seats but had backs to them, next time I would definitely want to sit there.  (Although I tend to dine with people who wouldn't like to sit in that configuration)

We started (we shared everything) with the smoked trout jalapeno poppers, or whatever they were called.  My dad liked this dish a lot, I did too but it wasn't my favourite.  We also had the lamb neck croquettes, this dish I liked more, I enjoyed the chick pea puree and crispy chick peas!  

We shared the perogies and the burger as our mains, I was glad I had read the reviews to not get the lamb pasta, the gentleman sitting next to me had ordered it and then sent it back and ordered something else!  It looked pretty boring.  The perogies were really good, and the burger was okay but compared to the Harbord Room burger ($19) and the shrimp stack at Daisho ($21), it was not worth the price at ALL.  So I wouldn't order that again, I don't think.  

Service was good, friendly, informed.  I didn't understand why, when explaining the desserts (without us asking her opinion), she told us one of the desserts wasn't as good as the others - seemed like an odd thing to bring up without prompt.  Either way, I had a good experience, and I would go back although I have way more places to try on my list first.  

And the bathroom had an old school hand dryer, no paper towels, so if you (and I hope you do) wash your hands it takes like a good 6 minutes to dry them.  Get a Dyson dryer, dudes!"}
{"text":"This is the second time for myself and my partner at this restaurant and we left the first time with fond memories and happy bellies. We were celebrating our anniversary and had tried to get a reservation on open table several weeks in advance. Open table only gave me limited times that wasn't convenient for us. I would recommend calling in to give yourself a better number options for seating times if you don't see a reservation time that you like on open table. I also asked the restaurant to hold off on any champagne due to the fact that it would be wasted on me. 

The service this time was a bit lacking in that we were waiting on our waiter to take our order for mains after we had already ordered appetizers. We started the meal off by getting a Kombucha and Spiced pear drink. We had the charcuterie board (3 options), and the trout crudo. Both appetizer were quite good with the crudo being slightly salty if you eat it in bites, but enjoying it as a single whole bite creates a better balance on the palate.  

When the server came to take our order for mains, he recommended the duck and the mushroom agnolotti. The agnolotti was as advertised, absolutely delicious, creamy, umami, and with the complexity and depth of flavour as you ate. If you're a light eater I suggest sharing, especially if you had apps. The duck was prepared two ways and I prefer the whole leg kept the way it was. The taste of crispy skin really highlights the dish. The croquette styled duck fritter was good but didn't have the same satisfaction for me as I ate it. The exterior didn't retain the same crunch or crispness and the overall texture in your mouth ended up being slightly mushy. 

The deserts were also a highlight. I got the Hawker Centre and my partner got the St. Snowman. The snowman dessert was cute and refreshing. I found the hawker centre to be quite interesting a surprise in both texture and flavour. The fish sauce listed on the menu intrigued me to get it. Despite the taste not really coming through (which I believe is what they were going for) the desert was well balanced and delicious."}
{"text":"This place is now one of my top 3 restaurants.
The burger is phenomenal. Best burger I have ever had and I am a burger lover.
The pierogies were also great and are good for vegetarians.
The asian steak tartare on top of crispy wontons was great.
The lamb croquettes were good but the mediterranean sauces kind of ruined it and made it feel like you were eating a felafel. The Saint Tavern's duck nuggets are much better.
The \"Acid Test\" dessert is quite oddly named but it is quite enjoyable. My first thought on tasting it was that it was like a \"little girl's childhood\". No, I'm not trying to be creepy. It tastes like fruity candies and cereals and the colours are vibrant and pink. Very pleasant but a bit too sweet, so I couldn't finish it all.
We sat at the chef's table in the back and watched the kitchen do its work. Service was very courteous and we even got a \"Hi\" from one of the kitchen staff.
Yes, this place is quite expensive but it is definitely worth the splurge for the fantastic quality."}
{"text":"Took a friend for an early dinner for her birthday and sat at the bar. The hostess and servers were helpful with suggestions and understanding that we only had a short window of time. The burger and the mushroom Agnolotti were recommended and we happily ordered both. 

Burger was delicious with pulled beef on the inside. Fries were crisp perfection. However, the real star was the pasta. The savoury Tamari butter dripped from tender parcels of mushroom and truffle. King Oyster mushroom chips and Hen the Woods provided contrasting textures. This pasta was seriously groan-worthy. Probably one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had!

I need to come here more often!"}
{"text":"We did a burger crawl all over Toronto and this is hands down the BEST burger in Toronto. Have sampled the rest of the menu, everything is top knotch, attention to detail is second to none."}
{"text":"Richmond Station is top notch

Top notch food: the food is made with love and served fresh and visually beautiful as well as obviously very delicious. Each bite is a treat and full of flavour

Top notch service: i don't normally comment on this but if I am commenting it's either really good or really bad. In this case it was amazing. I noticed the waitress keeping an eye on the table at all times if the water is out she brings a new one if your cup is half full she'll quickly refill it for you. So much care and this I think anyone would feel bad not tipping well

Top notch atmosphere: the thing that's special about this place is that I actually feel that the strangers around me are truly enjoying their meal and life. It may have totally been a coincidence or not but I actually see strangers talking to each other because they were intrigued by the plates served on another table. They genuinely get excited about all the food and people are eating and mingling magically. Wow

Don't know what else needs to be said, price is very fair too. Actually quite good for the top notch everything that you get."}
{"text":"High quality food, intimate yet comfortable atmosphere and knowledgeable and friendly service.
My friend and I split he need tartare as an appetizer and let me tell you- AMAZING. A must order. The beef pieces were the perfect size (I'm not a fan of when it's chopped too small) and marinated in a lovely lemon and herb mixture. It was served with a bed of spinach and house made hickory sticks (better than Humpty Dumpty himself).
I ordered the jerk chicken and my friend chose the nightly special: roasted duck with a honey glaze and root vegetables. Both meats were cooked perfectly and the sides were well chosen with the dish. 
Their wine list was small but still offered a variety. The Prince Edward County Cab Franc accompanied our meal nicely.
We were thoroughly impressed with the overall experience and would definitely consider dining there again."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place after hearing it was the concoction of the former top chef Canada finalist.  It's a pretty minimalist menu with a daily specials option written on the wall (typically sandwiches).  The resto itself is cute and a nice change from the larger chain options in the financial district.

We shared the polenta fries expecting a basket, and admittedly not knowing what polenta was - it's essentially cornmeal - but was pleasantly surprised.  The beet salad has a nice spin on it with tzatziki sauce on the bottom.  I had the grilled mahi mahi which was substituted for swordfish, but it was cooked perfectly on top of a half chickpea and half cajun puree which gave it a great sweet and spicy flavour.  

The stars of our meals were the desserts.  Go for the chocolate mousse.  This restaurant also has a good amount of gluten free options for how small the the menu is.  I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!!! Had the rabbit two ways and it was the best rabbit I've had anywhere. And I'm from new orleans we know food!  the bread that was served was great and the olive oil and balsamic was super tasty.  Had the beef tartare to start and it was a wonderful pairing of flavors with it. Just well done on both dishes and my drink was great too. Nice staff and nice place. would definitely go here again and can't wait to if i ever go back to toronto. No matter what you order i have a feeling it is really good here."}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to come check out this restaurant for some time and finally stopped in on my birthday for lunch. My friend and I shared the duck confit lettuce wraps, smoked trout hush puppies, and scallop crudo. All tasted great - I especially liked the hush puppies but the portions were a tad small. Our server recommended the Stn. Burger so we went with it and it was THE BEST burger I've ever had! I highly recommend it and want to go back for another tomorrow! I still want to try the other stuff on their menu too. All sounds so amazing!"}
{"text":"Very tasty and pretty. Went with 8 ladies for dinner and we were well looked after. Great recommendations."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. It had a really cool vibe to go along with some fantastic food. Supposedly the burger was the way to go so they sold me on it. What can I say? It lived up to the hype despite the high price point. I also opted for the lemon jasmine dessert with creme fraiche. It was super light, not sweet and delightful."}
{"text":"Had lunch here during NBA All Star Weekend 2016 and was not disappointed. The station burger and chicken sandwich were amazing. The meat simply tasted fresh and perfectly prepared. The chefs were extremely friendly, a nice compliment to go w/ the meal."}
{"text":"What to say of the best culinary experience I've had in the past however many years? That's a tall order, but dammit, every soul in Toronto has got to know the delicious truth about Richmond Station. 

Richmond Station has crafted an experience that is unexpected and elegant at every turn. From the delightful falafel cakes served up while we were waiting for a spot at the bar (don't even think about asking for a table if you don't have a reservation - locals are clearly aware of this spot's perfection), to the spacious bar that doesn't leave you rubbing elbows with someone else's date, to their out-of-this-world take on pumpkin pie, you will be left satisfied and, frankly, a little mystified every moment of the night. 

In terms of the food, as I said, I can't put it more honestly than this: it was the best food I've had in years. So wonderful, in fact, I literally can't come up with another experience as unforgettable as this one. We ordered a butternut squash soup to share, which was seasoned with crunchy pumpkin seeds and featured some shredded squash at the bottom of the bowl, and it was probably the closest thing to the taste of autumn possible. We also had a salad each - one with beets and goat cheese, and the other with white anchovies and some more squash (I was feeling the squash that night). My squash salad was light, but every bite felt so complex and layered. And the crunchy croutons perfectly complemented the softness of the squash. 

Dessert? Pumpkin pie - but pumpkin pie from your psychedelic dreams. The pumpkin filling is served as mousse-like dollops, and the crust is served as cracklings of sugary biscuits. The whipped cream is their own homemade take, as usual, and it's a delicate hybrid of whipped cream and ice cream. De-lish.

I've clearly gone off the rails (anyone into the restaurant themed puns, here?) with this review, but I have to mention the on point ambience. Despite the happening conversation all around us, I never failed to hear my own date, and the bar doesn't feel like some second-rate seat to the other tables behind you. Our bartender/server was always swooping in to clear our plates, prepping our table for the next slice of heaven. I love that kind of service - subtle, but always there when you need it.

TL;DR: You haven't lived until you eat here. Over & out."}
{"text":"In general, I am not very impressed with the food at Richmond station.
Their burger is really delicious. It is very juicy and full of favors. Portion is quite big as well.
However, other than the burger, everything else is just okay. There is no WOW factor in the dishes. Most dishes are tapas styles and small portion with expensive price tag. I don't think it is worthy of the price."}
{"text":"Visited Toronto for a girl's trip and came here based on recommendations from one of my friend's friends. After much debate and consideration, we decided to live large and go with the tasting menu which was a wonderful experience and a great value for a 10 course meal (came out to a little under $80 with tax/tip). I was so full at the end of the meal that I didn't eat until later afternoon the following day. 

The food was well balanced and prepared skillfully, but a little on the rich side for my palette. 8 courses in I was really regretting not wearing stretchy pants. Some highlights from the meal -

Duck liver pate - sinfully creamy and rich, the pate was nicely contrasted with a crisp brioche slice.

Charcuterie - I love me some cured meats and cheese but the highlight of the board was this amazing sharp mustard, don't know what is was but it was phenomenal

Pasta - this was off-menu so not sure what it was called but it was pumpkin or squash ravioli with broccolini, great pairing of sweet and bitter. 

Steak - also off-menu, medium rare juicy slices of steak.

Dessert - we enjoyed not one but two desserts! We had a lovely light sorbet with hints of jasmine that was a refreshing end to a heavy meal but the final dessert was incredible. It came out on a sheet that looked more like a modern art painting than food with dollops of honey, meringue, and mulled wine sorbet. 

I'd highly recommend this place to any foodies visiting Toronto!"}
{"text":"Farm to table. Common table. Small and fresh. If you only eat one place while you are in town, make it this one. Make a reservation as soon as possible though, its a very small place.

My choices!

CHARCUTERIE. (the choice of meats and cheeses was amazing and the accompaniments were dreamy)
SWORDFISH CONSERVA.  (These were like little tacos with jicama as the torilla - so so fresh!)
LAMB NECK CROQUETTE. (crispy little heaven)
CRISPY EGG CAESAR SALAD. (so fresh)"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, love the oysters and cocktails. Appetizers excellent including the beef carpaccio, samaosas and fries. Ambiance is nice and interior is quite simple but the food is truly outstanding (have been there 5+ times)."}
{"text":"Here I am just doing my small part in keeping up the high rating average for this spot. They deserve it. Excellent service and effort by all staff. These are classic dishes made with creativity and such care.

Given how close my office is to this spot it's surprising that I only recently checked it out (an after work dinner date with dad). I LOVED the salad special that I ordered as an app - I cannot recall the name but it was a very fresh springy one made with heirloom this and that. I particularly liked the contrasting element of a big hunk of this crispy speciality pork placed on top of it. It tasted like a different version of bacon. The Muscovy Duck is a huge portion and so tasty -- I would definitely order this again. The beet chutney on the burger was a nice touch.

I would not order the Japanese cheesecake again - a bit too out there for me, which I was quite surprised by. I appreciated the interesting tastes, textures and innovation aspect very much but I don't know, I just didn't love this one. The dainty deconstruction took away from my enjoyment and the flavours did not come together for me in a fully pleasing way. Overall, I was detached from my plate rather than lost in the moment as Fatty Natty can typically be with her dessert."}
{"text":"We came here for a bachelorette party and the staff were super-nice in accommodating us! 

I had their station. To be honest it was just a decent burger but this is probably because I am a little bit of a beef burger snob. I always remember a good burger, and this was just ok.

I wish I tried some of their other dishes to give a better review because my friends all loved their food. 

It is located at a bustling location and has very modern decor inside the restaurant - reminds me of a subway station"}
{"text":"I used to recommend this restaurant to other people.  Thanks to my experience last Friday, I don't think I will anymore.  It was a very simple matter, wine was left off of the order and I watched every other table in the section with the same server all receive their drink orders before I did.  My server, Molly, was no where to be found.  When we were finally able to spot her and catch her attention, her blase, not waiting for us to ask statement was, \"I forgot to enter your order, sorry.\"  Note, she was not sorry at all, and in fact, seemed fairly dismissive.  So is it normal, in the service industry, once there's been a mistake, that you don't work to fix it?  I've worked service for many, many years, and that is just not how it's done.  No drink was forthcoming, and I was then later informed, \"the bar's very busy, so your drink is not ready.\" 

Ah. I see now, is it my fault that I ordered wine?  Wow, how dare I inconvenience you with ordering.  How dare I wonder why it's my fault that the bar is busy.  Was it busy when I ordered?  How about when you forgot to put the order in?  I totally deserved your bad attitude.  

Food was good, but I doubt Molly had a hand in that.  I won't be back and I certainly won't recommend this restaurant anymore."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Richmond Station for some time, and four of us had an good evening there recently.
 The front section that we were seated in had a very high ceiling which took away much of the noise, so that we could mostly hear each other, despite it being very busy.

The service was efficient, informed and friendly throughout. (Although securing a table had been a bit of a palaver).

We brought our own champagne to start - corkage $25 - and then found a white Sauvignon and red pinot noir from the wine list. The wine list had a good selection, all reasonably priced -Cava $50, Sancerre $75 etc. The Sancerre was particularly good, mineral and petilant.

The food we had was excellent, however, it was premium priced. 
The duck liver pâté was soft and sweet. 
The pork and rabbit terrine was full flavoured with one nice very hot mustard accompanying it, amongst other pickles.
Our halibut was delicious and flaky, served warm, accompanied by oyster mushrooms which had a nice roasted taste to them.
The duck breast which was very thick was also served just warm, with a rather strong curry sauce. The ravioli were herbed and rounded in taste with hoisin sauce. The French fries, as is often the case, were heavily over salted.
The desert selection was limited; we passed.

It was certainly a bustling place with a rapid turnover of diners. Total bill for four, all in, just under $500."}
{"text":"My 60th bday with my sister and kids will be unforgettable!! Steve (the outstanding) waiter told us about the Chefs Table. It was something that people from a little village in eastern Ontario would never try. We did. It was amazing. The highlight was course after course of AMAZING food. I watched and rooted for chef Carl Heinrich on Top  Chefs. I never dreamed my kids would take me there. AND Chef was sweet enough to take a photo with me. All the chefs were amazing to watch. Wait staff from entering to leaving were amazing. Best birthday dinner ever. BEST. MEAL. EVER. Thanks Richmond Station Gang!!!  We WILL be back."}
{"text":"The burger was amazing! Service was good. Overall I liked the place but wish they had more variety and food options. But overall I liked eating there over a business lunch"}
{"text":"Awesome.  Have been here a few times.  Super casual.  Very cheap and amazing food. The pate is a stand out, as is the cheese plate but order anything and you can't go wrong!

They also have a very comprehensive wine list and delicious cocktails.  Since moving to Canada from NYC the thing I have most lamented is the short pours in drinks here (a shot in Canada is an ounce compared to the ounce and a half in the states) so one neat little thing I love here is they have varying amounts of alcohol in drinks and it's all listed for the ease of the patron.  So if you want a shortcut to buzz life they point you right to it.  Spoiler alert: it's the Manhattan."}

Atmosphere: The restaurant is not very prominent off Richmond but nicely decorated inside. There were no smaller private tables for me and my friend when we arrived so we got seated at the longer shared table. It is a bit awkward to be sitting so closely with others but we ended up enjoying our conversation with our neighbours anyways. Bonus: they have hooks on the side of the tables for your purse! 

Price: This is an upscale restaurant so it is priced on the higher side. One app, two mains and a dessert for two people priced around $80.

Presentation: Everything was beautifully presented. Presentation can't really get better than this! 

Taste: We ordered the beef bulgogi tartar. Oh man I am salivating thinking about the tartar. It was super fresh and served on crispy wonton chips. The mixture between the textures of tartar and chips was excellent. For my main I had the scallops and dessert was popcorn ice cream! 

Portion: Their portions were a little bit on the smaller side. Everything was dainty. 

Service: We were greeted by Teddy upon our arrival. She was amazing and extremely service oriented. She checked up on us a lot and also was extremely knowledgable about the dishes. She made he experience a great one."}
{"text":"What a wonderful restaurant! Knowledgeable and passionate staff, amazing head chef and outstanding food! Highly recommend charcuterie and giving the tasting menu a try! Have been craving this place since the moment I left"}
{"text":"Went in Feb, it was outstanding!  What I liked best was that every dish had a lot of thought and care put into it.  It was not a dish with just a single \"main attraction.\"  The other items on the plate went wonderfully with each item.  I was very impressed.  We ate quite a bit, but the plates that really stood out were the scallops (there were these delicious crunchy morsels with it) the special of the day which was the steak (absolutely fabulous! with  a scalloped potato side and great flavours, cooked perfectly!) pasta with sausage (very comforting, especially on such a cold day) and the spice cake with ginger sorbet (I didn't think I would like it, not a big fan of spice cake, but this was excellent!  The ginger sorbet was not overpowering and it tasted absolutely beautiful).  I know that what I ate is not on the menu right now, but that's what I love about this place, that the menu is ever changing.  LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype was. I ordered the Richmond Burger and the duck liver pate. Both were mediocre to me.

The service was great though."}
{"text":"Possibly our most favourite restaurant in the city! The food, the vibe, the service are all stellar! During our last visit, we had the rabbit which was literally falling off the bones and was so delicious. We also had the duck (Two ways) which was one of the best we've had. You have to try it to know just how incredible the food is! We had the maple cured trout as an appetizer and ended the meal with the fantastic coconut and chilli dessert. The dessert was so pretty and literally bursting with flavour. We could not get enough of it. Richmond Station is truly one of Toronto's culinary assets! If you haven't been yet, definitely put it on your list!!"}
{"text":"Yum!  My friends and I were on TripAdvisor (sorry Yelp) looking up restaurants to go to and this one came up as #2 in Toronto.  Seeing as #1 costs $70/person, we opted for the more fiscally responsible silver medal.  When we originally got there at 7 PM, we were told there wasn't a table available until 8:30, but through some magical shuffling, the friendly staff managed to snag us a table under the condition that we finish within 1.5 hours.  Plenty of time.

We started off with the jerk turkey wraps and some oysters, which were all very tasty.  I ordered the STN burger, friend #1 had the scallops from the chalkboard menu and friend #2 had the beef dish from the chalkboard menu (I wish I could remember what it was called).  The burger was AMAZING.  The patty was juicy, the sauce was flavourful, and the bun was so soft.  It came with a generous serving of addictive rosemary fries as well.  The scallops were quite good, but the price ($27) compared to the relatively smaller portions would deter me from getting them in the future.  On the other hand, the beef dish looked and tasted delicious.  As soon as it came to the table, I regretted not ordering it for myself.  It came with a side of kale, puree, and sauce that complemented the entire meal very well.

Overall, I had an excellent experience here from the food, to the staff, to the ambiance, and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this restaurant after my cousin reminded me about the restaurant's owner, Carl, winner of Top Chef Canada (Season 2). It was the only season of Top Chef that I watched! Anyway, my cousin really enjoyed this place and she said when I visit her in Toronto, she would bring me. So she did!

We came here for lunch on a Wednesday. It opened at 11:30 am, and when we got there, we found out that it was fully booked. But since we were there early, they were able to give us a table for 1.5 hrs, which was fine for us! We requested a seat with a view of the Chef's area.

The price fix menu of the day for lunch (weekdays) is a pretty good deal. This menu changes every day, I think. It's a pretty good idea. Regulars can come in and try something new every time! For $19, you get an appetizer and entrée that usually isn't from their regular menu, and you can also add a regular dessert for $5. I think for this kind of food, it's well worth it! And it did not disappoint!

We both got the lobster bisque to start. This was amaaaazing. It was a light cream broth with lots of lobster taste. Just delicious. Probably one of the best bisques ever!!!

I got the Moscow Ruben. At first, I ordered the Meatballs & Marinara, but overheard that the Ruben was actually a sliced sausage. This sounded very delicious and unique so I went for it and changed my mind! I was happy I did. The ruben was so good! It had a bit too much sauerkraut in the sandwich, maybe, but I still enjoyed it. The sauce also had quite a bite in it - it made my nose feel funny like when you eat too much wasabi! It came with a side of fries, which were very salty but otherwise well cooked. I dipped it in the dijon, but it was nice of the waitress to offer me another dipping sauce. There was also a small heap of pickles, which were in some sort of sweetish brine (maybe?) and really good.

My cousin got the Meatballs & Marinara over polenta. She liked it, but she didn't like the salad it came with because it was bitter and sour. I liked it though. The meatballs were soft and juicy and the marinara sauce was good.

We ended by sharing the deconstructed chocolate tart. The black tea ice cream was amazing!! It tasted like milk tea in ice cream form! I wanted to take it all home!!! The gelatin thingy with chocolate ganache inside was very good. The brownie pieces were average. The presentation was really nice and the dessert tasted great overall.

Service was very good. They were attentive and the waitress other than ours was also very helpful. They were very patient and answered all of our questions well.

I really want to come back again, definitely for another lunch special. But I don't think I can fit it into my trip unless I really have the time. Maybe I will bring my BFF here!! YUM!"}
{"text":"Charcuterie
wine
rabbit two ways
slow cooked trout
heritage pork
rhubarb lassi
ice cream bar

The rabbit was delicious, the sweet apples, celeriac, parsnip puree was delicate and yet filling. I hadn't had food this good in a very long time. WOW. 
The rhubarb Lassi was nice but i just wanted the foam. All the parts put together were nice, but the rose water foam was pretty epic. 
Charcuterie plate was the best i'd had in a long time. I was pretty nervous when the last bit of meat was on the plate, I pretty much B-lined for it and didn't care who saw. too good to care. 

All of it was delicious, service was impeccable as well. They didn't have seating for us right away, and made us feel welcome even though we had to wait. Very gracious wait staff. 

well done."}
{"text":"Food was excellent but is pricey. Food is all made in house. We tried the ricotta cheese and a charcuterie board for appetizers the sizes were smaller but the food was fresh and flavourful. Dinner we tried the Station Burger which was very tasty. The beet chutney gave the burger a nice sweet taste which works so much better than ketchup. 
The portion sizes are smaller but we were satisfied after enjoying our meal.
Reservations are a must for sit down dinner but they do have a standing waiting area where you could order snacks and drinks as well as a communal bar area. The serving staff were very friendly and accommodating. We had multiple servers come up to ask how we were enjoying ourselves. 

Definitely going back again"}
{"text":"Tucked away just off Yonge and fashioned to give a Toronto-worthy salute to the subway, Richmond Station feels like a sexy, secret clubhouse. Thankfully, the only thing it has in common with an actual TTC station is that it gets crowded during peak hours.

We kicked off our Thursday night with a cool bottle of white from Prince Edward County's Huff Estates. It paired wonderfully with our savory supper, which we enjoyed in clear view of the bustling open kitchen.

APPS:
With creamy celery remoulade, chewy kale, crunchy croutons and soft 'shrooms, the Crispy Egg Caesar Salad ($12/18) demonstrated the most artful combination of contrasting qualities since the Spice Girls. We wiped the plate clean with the house-made bread. The Butternut Squash Soup ($7) was met with hearty approval from our lactose-intolerant dining partners.

ENTREES:
Seared Digby Scallops ($29) came four to a plate surrounded by spaetzle, with each bite alternating between lemony tang and hazelnut earthiness. I reluctantly turned in half the plate to my date in exchange for one of the chalkboard menu specials, Butter Poached Halibut ($29). Plated beautifully on a bed of radish, carrot, zucchini and mashed potato, the fish was incredibly light and tender. Didn't beat the scallops, though I'm not sure what could.

DESSERT:
I rarely rave the most about sweets, but pastry chef Farzam Fallah's offerings are an easy exception. One order was a special - black sesame pound cake ($9) with lemon ice cream and goat cheese. The other, unassumingly called \"Movie Snacks\", was the highlight of the whole meal: chocolate torte, popcorn ice cream, almond brittle, cola meringue (!!!) and \"Twizzlers\" puree ($9). If you want a big chunk of cheesecake, go to the Pickle Barrel - both of these desserts came totally deconstructed in cubes, foams, shards and dollops.

The bill came flanked by pieces of chocolate ginger fudge, which is probably the best way for bills to arrive. A lovely finish to an altogether great, inventive and flavourful meal. I'll mind the gap between visits."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for a business trip and looking for a place to eat lunch while catching up on emails between meetings.  Coming here off hours (around 2pm) was perfect - it was not crowded and they're still offering their lunch special.

I sat at the high table and set up my working station while waiting for my food.  Call ahead for their daily lunch special which I think ends at 3pm? (don't think it was posted online).  I opted for the light lunch which includes quinoa salad and cheese platter.  Perfect size.

Service was prompt and not intrusive.  Most of the workers are preparing for dinner service.

I'll come back here and even bring clients back."}
{"text":"Every experience I've has at Richmond Station deserves 5 stars. From the delicious food to the knowledgeable and attentive staff, this place is doing it all right. 

We walked in on a Friday after the lunch rush and were seated in 10 minutes. Considering there were no reservations available when I called a week in advance, I was surprised by the short wait time. 

My two coworkers ordered from the Friday prix fixe menu which changes every week and has a great variety of choices. I on the other hand, was torn between the prix fixe, because I wanted the smoked pork and lentil soup, and the Station burger, because it's amazing. The staff was so accommodating that they allowed me to pay $12 for my burger and add the special soup for $5. Yay! 

If you have never eaten at Richmond Station, you must try the Station burger. You will not regret this choice. Made with high quality beef and cooked to medium rare, the burger is juicy and decadent without being greasy. The toppings on the burger are what take it to the next level. The milk bun is so soft and light, the beet chutney adds some sweetness and the cheese ads the right amount of salt. I could go on and on about this burger.... you just need to try it.

I also ordered the tea & chocolate dessert. A contemporary plating style and many different textures and flavours made this one of the most interesting desserts I've ever had.

You can't go wrong with anything on the menu and if you could not get reservations,  it is definitely worth the wait for a table!"}
{"text":"My go to place for  casual DT business lunches. Vibrant atmosphere, great service, and excellent food. The variety of flavors and ingredients is impressive. My favorites are the quinoa salad and duck confit. Delicious! The only down side is that the restaurant feels very crammed and privacy is limited."}
{"text":"We've been here at least 5 times, having the tasting menu and it's always fun to watch Carl & his team cook away. We are very full after the meal, and it's only $65 for the tasting menu. The chef will make you at least a 5-7 course meal, you'll never be hungry at the end. Prices for wines are very reasonable, glasses go from $11 - 15 and bottles are $40 - 100. I love this place, email or call to book a table. I don't use their online tool."}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch. Place was very busy but we got a seat in the back by the open kitchen. Had ceviche, quinoa salad and the sandwich of the day. Everything was very good and in a reasonable portion size for lunch. Prices wee arguably more appropriate for dinner but business  seems good. Service was very friendly and helpful. Would return ."}
{"text":"I came here last night with a large group and we all had a good time. It was quite loud, busy and space was a little tight, but I was happy to be there.

The complimentary bread came with a flavourful dipping sauce. I only wished that it was served warm. I had the Stn. Burger medium-well done and it was delectable! It was not too large, and definitely flavourful. It came with a heaping portion of fries, which were just alright. Another person at the table ordered half fries, half salad, which was the way to go. A small portion of vegetables also was accompanied with a sweet sauce. Another person at the table had the polenta fries and described them as being a little salty. Two others had the pork chop (one of the specials) and said that it was satisfactory, but the server should have provided sharper knives, as it was a little hard to cut through. 

Our server was a very pleasant and friendly man and all the servers briefly described each dish as it arrived on the table. I definitely had a satisfying meal and would recommend it!"}
{"text":"The food. The wine. The food...

The service, the ambiance, the open kitchen, the chefs, the flavors. Everything was phenomenal.

A must if you're in the area."}
{"text":"An amazing dining experience! The menu was simple, but offered something for everyone. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and friendly, and helpful with any questions we had. There was a good selection of wine, beer, and cocktails as well. All of our food contained amazing and unique flavours. Will definitely be back! Since it is quite a busy spot, I recommend making reservations well in advance."}
{"text":"I had heard amazing things about this place for years and we finally made it. 

The burger is a touch on the small side, but my goodness is it good. I am having a very hard time deciding between my favourite burger in Toronto - it is either Richmond Station or The Harbord Room. 

The charcuterie was lovely and the fresh pasta was delicious. 

It seems like everything they make is good. You really cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant.  Sat at chef's table - watching the symphony of creating amazing dishes was spectacular.  The food was better"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant with creative dishes and amazing presentations.  Also an inventive name!

Food at the restaurant is produced by Chef Carl Heinrich, who was the winner of Top Chef Canada, Season 2.  His talent really does shine as the dishes showcase his attention to pairing ingredients, creating varying texture, all with plating presentations that is pleasing to the eye.  My partner and I had Pork Ravioli and and Grilled Eurobass, which were both amazing.  The roasted beet salad was also very tasty.

For dessert we had the Salt Lovers Anonymous, which was also very inventive and delicious.

Service was great and the ambience was nice, with a clean and a bit rustic character throughout.

Richmond Station is always busy so reservations are highly recommended."}
{"text":"I went here to try their tasting menu along with 7 of my family members. The meal was amazing. The waiter and sommelier were extremely helpful - they even offered a meal alternative for my brother who was allergic to raw carrots without previous notice.

Would definitely recommend for anyone who wants to try a restaurant that is guaranteed to provide both value and taste. Save room though, the deserts are amazing."}
{"text":"Thank you, Yelp for introducing me to such a gem! The ambience was fantastic and even with a lack of reservations -- play it safe; make a reservation -- we sat at the bar and enjoyed a lot of their specials. The polenta fries are a must as a started. I had the lamb ragu for my entree and loved every bite. I'm already thinking about my next dish there!"}
{"text":"At Richmond station we wanted to see if there was a \"chef choice \" option. The waiter said yes. He said it varies from day to day depending on what the chef thinks is the best on the menu, so we went with that. 

I went with friends, group of 6. We had oyster as appetizer, two each. Then came a meat platter. Our favourite was the duck foie gras.  One our friend is allergic to seashells so the chef modified and gave her ceviche which she loved. Then we had salad, chef gave us 3 different salad to try and share among us. Then for the main the chef made 3 dishes of lamb and 3 of beef to share. We had a salmon each. Finally we finished with a dessert platter. 

We thought the dessert lacked flavouring. Carrot cake had too much of a ginger taste for some reason. Chocolate cake wasn't strong enough. Other wise it was great. 

We re all definitely looking forward to coming back !"}
{"text":"Came to town for a short tour and found this joint on Yelp. Really good find, we had the specials and both were delicious. Drinks are phenomenal and the service is possibly a step beyond that. Next time we're in town, we'll be sure to stop by."}
{"text":"My friend and I had lunch during the week and were the first ones to arrive at the restaurant at 11:15. We both ordered the cod dish and the portion was extremely small. The tiny piece of fish sat on a large piece of sourdough bread. A customer at the table next to us ordered the same dish and his fish portion was twice the size of ours. The value was not there at $30.00 for a tiny piece of fish. Moreover, the waitress never came around to ask us how our meal was. The best part of the dish was the sauce-covered sourdough bread."}
{"text":"Richmond Station is a super cool restaurant in downtown Toronto with a cool hipster vibe. It is very unassuming from the outside and easy to miss, but if you do find your way inside you are in for a great meal.  
I loved the ambiance here-the chalkboard displaying the specials and the open kitchen gave a real no-frills vibe that lends itself to awesome food.  
The wine list was fantastic and vey diversified. The bread and dip they give you to start was so delicious. I think I even tasted maple syrup in the oil? At the insistence of fellow yelpers I ordered the polenta fries which did not disappoint.  For my main course I had a scallop special which was phenomenal. 
The only thing that beats the food here is the service. Canadians are the friendliest people ever, and the servers here were no exception. They helped friends and I find a cool place to drink after dinner, and recommended places to visit for the rest of our stay. Excellent food and excellent service, doesn't get any better!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the staffs were pretty helpful. Try the most popular dishes,worth the price.will come back again"}
{"text":"Great farm to table restaurant.  Staff was very friendly and accommodating.  The burger was awesome."}
{"text":"We went with the prix fixe lunch for $21.  My quinoa salad appetizer was amazing.  It was light and refreshing with many different textures, colors, and tastes.  My main course was a chicken sandwich which was good but did not stand out.  For dessert, I had the berry cheesecake which is not your typical cheesecake as its their own take  on it.  It comes out beautifully plated and deconstructed.  I saw on other tables, that all their desserts are plated very well."}
{"text":"I'd give it 6 stars if I could. 
Perfection. We had a 4 HR dinner experience as the four of us enjoyed the chefs menus with pairings. I have a few difficult intolerances with food. They mastered everyone ! 
Believe all the hype ! And go!"}
{"text":"I'll start how it's supposed to be - with desert - deconstructed Carrot Cake was a hit. I wanted to try their desert special (pear rhubarb cobbler) but it was not ready yet (before dinner), and then chef himself came and erased it from the black board. I asked him what is going on and he explained that desert didn't make a cut - not good enough to serve. Second, the aioli (served with delicious polenta fries) is excellent. Their burger and wine (local Cab blend) both were top notch too. Service was exceptional as well."}
{"text":"First time for this place and it was good but not great as some of the ratings reflect. I started out with the oysters, which were small and overpriced at 3.50 per oyster but fresh. The next course was the Special of the day which was roasted duck. Tasty but a little tough. All in all it was ok, but with the choices you have downtown I might consider another place."}
{"text":"Innovative and consistently good quality dishes. Not pretentious, which I fully appreciate!"}
{"text":"Grea service.. Amazing experience. I will come back with my family"}
{"text":"Creativity and an element of surprise certainly earn points where the palate is concerned, but Richmond Station pushes it one step further by producing flavor combinations, which, had I not been in public, would inspire me to literally lick my plate clean. Of the numerous meals I consumed in Toronto & New York City these past few weeks, I count Richmond Station as amongst the best of the best. 

The lowdown:
- fun \"temperance cocktails\" -- mine with lavender, his with grapefruit 
- fried pecorino and strawberry salad: almond granola imparted an unexpected crunch. Fresh fruit & veggies (snap peas) offset the full-bodied dairy components, including black pepper yogurt
- mushroom agnolotti: a delicate pasta dish of mushroom-stuffed pockets with hints of tangy goat cheese. Fried sourdough breadcrumbs were excellent. The entire dish was superb. 
- chocolate torte w/ earl grey pudding & anise ganache. I swapped orange sorbet for smoked vanilla, & the result was an earthy, robust, delicious one. The cucumber and tamarind elements in his coconut parfait were each too strong to be on one dish. I call these \"adult\" desserts because they aren't traditionally super sweet; savory flavors are equally, if not predominantly, showcased. 

A charming spot in Toronto's downtown core serving incredibly innovative dishes that satisfied each one of my 10,000 taste buds."}
{"text":"The chef's menu was the way to go! The chef's curated menu left nothing to be desired except more room in our stomachs to keep on eating. Between 7 people we had a mostly family style menu with the following dishes: Scallion Polenta Fries, Liver Mousse, Roasted Carrot Salad, Trout Salad, Brassica Caesar, Fish Soup, Beef Shank with mushroom gravy, London Fog & Stn. Snowman for dessert. The desserts were out of this world, both in taste & curation! 
The staff was extremely accommodating, answered all my questions on how the chef's menu worked, listened to me rattle off 5 things I would prefer not to eat & had great attention to detail to ensure no one ate something against dietary restrictions.
The best part of the meal was the ability to sit back and relax between dishes with ample time to digest the previous course before moving on. Having experienced the chef's menu with others who've enjoyed it in the past, I know it's not a fluke we had a great experience and this is the experience all guests can expect when they dine at Richmond Station."}
{"text":"They always have amazing dishes. The beef tartare really need to try. The pork of the main dishes, has so many flavors just in one single dish. Must try!"}
{"text":"Three of us came for a leisurely lunch. The beef tartare appetizer was very tasty and a different presentation than I have seen (four individual pieces each on a potato croquette). I ordered the kale salad with chicken for lunch which was good but not better than any other kale salad I have had. 

The dessert menu was very unique and most are inspired by drinks (lassi, bubble tea and piña colada). I ordered the bubble tea dessert which has tapioca, lychee sorbet and matcha, unusual but I liked it!

This is a hot spot so definitely recommend a reso."}
{"text":"SERVICE: My friend and I went to Richmond Station on a Friday night and waited for about 10 minutes to be seated. We didn't have reservations. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable and provided us with multiple suggestions. I asked for a Moscow Mule which wasn't on the menu and the server was able to make one for me anyways. She was also attentive and checked up on us several times to make sure we had everything we needed, good service overall.

FOOD: The portions were filling and the presentation of the dishes were refined. Between the two of us, we ordered four items:

A dozen of oysters: From New Brunswick, they were fresh! We love horse radish and the server topped us up with this, as requested.

The beef tartare: My favourite! The beef tartare was served on mini crunchy bread and the bite-sized portions were perfect! It was rich in flavour and we wanted to order a second one but we were too full after.

Duck two ways: This was highly recommended by the server and we decided to try it. Personally, I didn't like this dish as I felt it was too heavy. The duck was cut too thick and the pieces were too big. The duck croquette was too sweet. The duck was served on a bed of veggies, asparagus, mushrooms, parsnip puree which was the best part of this dish.

Soft shell crab: Loved this, it was packed with flavour and was nice and crispy. It was topped with some onions which mixed well with the soft shell crab. It paired well on top of some mashed potatos and veggies.

AMBIENCE: Richmond Station's ambience is nicely decorated with simple décor and a modern vibe. 

This visit was a 4/5 because of the duck dish, however I've been to Richmond Station twice before this particular visit, and all the dishes are always rich in flavour and each time was a unique experience since they always change their menu, the other visits were a 5/5."}
{"text":"Following the advice of Yelp, I stopped in Richmond Station for a quick lunch. The small restaurant seems to be really popular among the businessmen and women of Toronto, since at 2pm the only available table for 2 was at the bar. The staff was really friendly, and I ordered a beet salad with chicken and the famous Station burger ($22!?). 

The locally-sourced salad was really fresh, and the chicken was moist and tender. I ordered my burger medium rare (per the request of the waiter). The burger was amazing - the patty consisted of two types of beef (traditional ground beef and roast beef). The house-made burger bun was thick and able to absorb all of the delicious juices that came out of the meat. My one complaint would be that ground beef seemed more medium well than medium rare, but overall the burger was really good. The fries were also really tasty (it tasted like they had been cooked in beef fat, or it might've just been the juice running out of my burger). 

If you're an American burger purist looking for a ground beef patty, Richmond Station might disappoint you, but if you're looking for a modern burger experience in Toronto, I would give it a try."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch.  Great quality and execution. 
Had the scallops which were cooked perfectly. The coq au vin was probably the best rendition I've ever had. Moist and deep flavours. And great service as well."}
{"text":"best ever!!! I was so impressed (maybe because the waitress knew it was our first time) , but it was great because I had a table for 4 and we ordered 1 dessert to share, but then our waitress came out with a complimentary dessert. .WHO DOESN\"T appreciate free delicious dessert? I already enjoyed my meal so much .. the extra dessert to share just blew me away!

my crusted sea bass was AMAZING!! sizing of the dish was great for the price and the amount that I can eat! It was perfect. I can't remember the last time I had sea bass and it being so flavourful and delicate all together ---a party in my mouth!

We were seated in the back area (surprisingly this place is pretty big. When we first entered in the restaurant we thought it was just the rectangular space we saw... but then we weren't seated yet... we kept walking and up the stairs we go to this other section (where we see an open concept kitchen) not fully opened concept but at least I can spy and see if I can find the top chef!! (but i didn't).. 
Also if you ever need to book this place for a party, it would be perfect because they have a separate room *really cozy and cute for a party for 12 it looks like. This place it great. Highly recommend. 

Good place for dates and good place to bring out your friends for catching up!"}
{"text":"So good!  We went there in late Oct. during high traffic time for dinner. We were told that they were full except for the chef's table (overlooks the kitchen area).  Sold!  Food was unique and freaking delicious, from the entrees to drinks and desserts!  Loved it.  The staff were attentive & even posed for pictures despite it being a full house in there.  Definitely would return if in town again!  Just make sure you make a reservation-the place was PACKED."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Sit at the chef's rail and watch them cook.   Will be back."}
{"text":"Richmond Station has some of the highest Yelp ratings that I've ever seen, so I had to come check it out! I could only get a 5:30pm reservation on a Friday night, so be sure to reserve early... This place gets super busy throughout the night.

I tried the following items on the dinner menu: 
- Oysters
- Charcuterie
- Mussels
- STN Burger
- London Fog dessert

Everything tasted good, but not amazing. The Mussels and the Station Burger were probably my favourite. I really liked the meat inside the burger - it was cooked perfectly. Very tasty and juicy! Gave me that melt-in-your-mouth kind of feeling. However, I thought the rest of the items I tried were just OKAY and pretty mediocre in comparison. I sort of wish I ordered some of the other dishes instead. 

In terms of service, our server was great! He was extremely attentive and friendly. The food runners always made sure to greet us in a polite manner, thoroughly explaining what each dish was made out of. Loved it! 

Overall, I had a good time here. It's a nice place for a casual sit-down meal. I just expected a bit more out of such a highly rated restaurant. I don't think I would come back again since it is on the pricier side, but it was still a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto.
The atmosphere, service and presentation is wonderful.
I love the polenta fries, any of the beef entrees are great and their desserts look like art. This restaurant is definitely 5/5."}
{"text":"excellent service and great food.  I had the mushroom soup, crispy egg salad, and the rabbit 2 ways and one beer.  It was a very well executed meal with the egg salad probably being the most unique.  Imagine a hard boiled egg that had the yolk still runny and then battered and deep fried to give it a nice contrast of crispy outside + fully cooked egg white, and then warm egg yolk in the center served on a bed of arugula.  The mushroom soup was good but nothing that wowed me.  The rabbit 2 ways was very good although I thought it did not need the extra bacon bits which I thought over powered the mild flesh of the rabbit, even still the rabbit was tender and well seasoned along with the other flavors on the dish.  Definitely a great place for a large group so you can all get something different and share or a date with a lady you want to impress.  Top notch."}
{"text":"A really beautiful and  completely awesome experience here.  I think my YEA (Yelp Elite Assistant) would agree that it was a very fitting way to celebrate a birthday.

The first thing that pleasantly surprised me was that there was a raised upper level to the restaurant that also has an open view into the Richmond Station's kitchen.  It was cool to see the hustle and bustle of the chef's behind the line and it wasn't a distraction at all.  

Tip:  If you want a more close-up view of the action, they have a single seating bar right at the chef's window.

The service was excellent and the servers take the time to explain to you the dishes you are about to consume.  The decor is subtle and it lends itself to just fade away while you focus on the food put in front of you.

Began the experience with a shared dish of beef tartare on toast points made of crispy layered slices of potato.  It was crunchy and the beef tartare was well seasoned.

The bread and olive oil/balsamic was a delightful surprise at the start of the meal too.  I think they mentioned that it was a cold-pressed soy bean olive oil and balsamic blend.  It was really light and sweet and we had to stop ourselves from asking for more bread to sop it all up.

The pork and rabbit pate on croute was another good sharing plate.  it was done well and you can taste the contrasting deep and light flavours of the pork and rabbit pate.  The mustard and pickled shallots were nice compliments to add some bite to the dish.

We opted for the rabbit 3 ways and the heritage pork as our main courses for the evening.

I really enjoyed the rabbit 3 ways and the loin that was sautéed was my favourite part.  The apple chips, roasted apple chunks, bacon lard-ons, and the parsnip puree were all great complementary items to the dish.  The only hiccup in the dish was the deep-fried rabbit squares where I found a sharp rabbit bone fragment while chewing through it.  I'm glad I was able to find it the way I did otherwise I could have been a very painful experience in my mouth.  Even if the bone wasn't there, that part of the dish didn't really do anything for me.

I tried some of the heritage pork from my partner's dish and I found it a little hard to cut through and a bit tough to chew through as well.  Maybe I've just never had heritage pork cooked the right way.  So mixed feelings on this one.

The cap off of the night was ordering not one but two desserts to celebrate my YEA's birthday.   They were able to bring out a nice wooden plan with a small candle and a \"happy birthday\" message written out in chocolate drizzle.

I really enjoyed the red velvet chocolate cake with the sea salt ice cream although I graciously let my other half consume most of it. :-)  The cake was fluffy and soft with the beet and cream cheese sauces.  While the other dessert (I forget the name of it) was a deconstructed combination of textures and flavours that kinda tingle on your tongue.

I would recommend coming here for an experience that is on the lower end of the $$$ spectrum.  I thought the prices were quite fair for the final dishes that were presented to us. :-)"}
{"text":"Dine here for lunch once a month with friends and colleagues. NEVER disappointed. The polenta fries are a must have. I love the quinoa salad with humus. The small size is perfect if you're having an app or sharing sides. Beet salad is delicious. The burger is among the best in the city.  Have not yet been for dinner but anxious to try. Difficult to get lunch reservations so book in advance."}
{"text":"Very great dinner with my husband in here! Very good service! I like they all the appetiser!"}
{"text":"I believe that a restaurant experience should connect to the price. At Richmond Station it did. Every bite from the chilled oysters to the amazing beet salad and the smoked trout bourguignon was a taste sensation. It was a bit hard to find, signage being minimal but don't give up. Also handy that you can reserve online with a real-time system. Six days ahead I had to choose between 5:15 and 8:30."}
{"text":"Cocktails were amazing.  Polenta fries tasted like Kraft dinner cheese with a twist - interesting.  Service was a bit too casual - cheezy and sarcastic. Someone was having a bad day?"}
{"text":"Toronto's Richmond Station provided one of the best meals I have had in years! Highlights of the evening included the welcoming and truly attentive service of the entire staff who delivered perfect dishes and wine throughout the evening, but the star was the FOOD.  From the moment you check out the specials board just inside the entrance to your first bite of bread dipped in oil with the added kiss of red wine vinegar and maple syrup you will know you are in the best of hands.  But its the glory of the meal that will send your tastebuds to paradise.  Tonight our two best dishes in years were the scallops special ---  incredibly fresh scallops served on a bed of kale and green beans BEAUTIFULLY prepared with a pepper puree, followed by the magical chocolate mousse dessert, it looks gorgeous and tastes even better!

The scallop dish is an artfully creative beautiful dish served by sous chef Hayden Johnston. Scallops are drizzled with a delicate sauce that promises creamy citrus notes that bring out the scallop's nutty sweetness, and the pepper puree will combine with different vegetables on the plate to create unique flavor profiles that literally blow your mind. Seriously and without exception, one of the best dishes either of us have ever eaten in the past several years of traveling. 

Richmond Station's Chocolate Mousse Dessert was a palate pleasing homage to a genius combination, Scotland's rare single malt scotch and rich dark chocolate.  Each bite builds a dessert that is the perfect end to a truly unforgettable meal. 

Thank you to the entire Richmond Station team, your chef's table is an incredible experience.  You should be so very proud, you rocked it!

Oh...and did I add that without the wine (which was AMAZING) our meal with tax cost less than $100??? That's a five star meal, with an incredible experience and phenomenal service on a warm star filled night in downtown Toronto at one of the BEST RESTAURANTS in the city, for less than a hundred dollars. WOW."}
{"text":"My experience at Richmond Station was a solid 4/5.  

I had the scallop crudo for the appetizer. It was very fresh, thinly cut, and well seasoned, but the portion was TINY. 

For the main, I had the rabbit two ways. Really enjoyed this dish, it was crispy on the outside and soooo tender on the inside, and perfectly seasoned. 

However, my favourite dish was definitely the dessert. I ordered the acid test, just out of curiosity from the name. The dish was an explosion of various flavours, and I loved the presentation (see photo), so innovative and creative! 

The service was pretty mediocre, hence the 4/5 rating."}
{"text":"While I am quite the adventurous eater, my dining companions were not.  This lady for limited menu options.   

The specials all looked fantastic, but nearly every one was sold out by the end of the night. 

My meal was delicious and filling, but watching my girlfriend pick at hers was a little off putting.    One of the issues she had was that she couldn't tell what was what on her plate.  I have to agree I was in a similar boat with my plate.  

It's worth trying if you are all diehard foodies, but don't take anyone there if they have simple taste.   Everything is just a little too much for the style of restaurant they have."}
{"text":"Richmond Station has been on my \"to-go\" list ever since opening last year. Finally had the chance to check it out, and it did not disappoint!

While I read many suggestions to order off the board, a few of the items were sold out for the evening. That being said, the menu has a good selection of meat, fish, veggie - we ended up ordering the charcuterie, pakoras and burgers. 

I have to admit, a few of the items (ie. the pakoras) were surprising given his farm to table concept the chef is known for - as well, the \"subway\" theme I could live with our without. But overall it was very all inventive and delicious. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday for the slow roast lunch special. The special was Roast Beef. It came served with Caramelized Onion, Pomme Puree, Sauteed Swiss Chard, Roasted Carrots, Horseradish, & Garlic Beef Au Jus for under $25. The roast beef flavor was outstanding with excellent vegetable pairings. The roast beef was juicy, tender, and I savored every bite. I would definitely recommend the Saturday lunch special."}
{"text":"I went there to celebrate my roommate's bday last year after reading amazing reviews from Yelp. It didn't disappoint me at all. The best food I have ever had. The servers are amazing. Now it is my go-to place to celebrate big occasions.  It is kinda pricey for students, so I can't go as often as I want to."}
{"text":"My experience thus far is limited, but wow, this is my favorite restaurant in Canada.  Excellent service.  Great wine and drinks.  And above all, fantastic and creative food!  Try the tasting menu!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here - just a wonderful restaurant, great staff and amazing food. 

We brought our own bottle of wine ($25 corkage fee) and ordered the chef tasting menu.  Every item of food was delicious.  The burger was incredible.  We also had wild boar.  Dessert was so amazing!  

The staff were all friendly - we got to meet the Chef Carl Heinrich who seemed genuinely interested in our feedback and hopeful we enjoyed our meal.

I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We popped in late on a Friday night for a quick drink that turned into a delicious charcuterie and beers. All reasonably priced. Will be back for sure. Make sure you book!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. Sat at the chef bar and enjoyed watching the food being prepared. The chickpea fritters were excellent and the burger is to die for! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The experience was amazing. I got the 2 way rabbit- basically one piece of it is grilled and the other fried. Taste SUPER good. My friend got a burger which was also excellent. If you come to this restaurant you HAVE to try their dessert. We got the chocolate mousse and it's one of the best and most interesting dessert i have ever had:). Love it!! The food is  slightly expensive but overall it's  acceptable. Go try it out! Remember to book your table beforehand because the restaurant is really small so if you don't make a booking you probably will have to wait for a bit."}
{"text":"Having heard of the big name from my friends many times, I didn't have a chance to go try it until the team dinner last Christmas.

It's absolutely more than I'd expected. The rabbit dish is interesting and very popular. I loved London Fog so much that I literally couldn't speak for several minutes and almost cried (it's because of the orange blossom jelly, which reminded me of my childhood).

Overall, the whole meal was fantastic. The music was fantastic (and I'm serious, sitting there and listening to the music is like an unexpected blind date with an old best friend), and it's a perfect place for friends to gather together and chat and enjoy the dinner and the time.

The food might not be the best and the tastiest in the world, but I did feel the feelings and emotions delivered by the dishes, which makes it my favorite restaurant in Toronto so far."}
{"text":"I have been here so many times and have sampled many of their menu items like their famous medium rare burger(unbelievable) the meat is soooo good. To their daily off menu items. The place is constantly busy and reserve ahead. The wait staff is great. When I see celebrity chefs in there like Christine Cushing and Mark McEwan the place must be great."}
{"text":"I went for my birthday and this restaurant was so amazing. I ordered the lobster capillini & oh.my!!! Spectacular !! All the flavors exploded & melded together! The waiter brought us soft shell crab ceasar \"for a treat\" - we weren't charged! Yummmm! The dessert was strawberry cake and it was delectable!!! I recommend this place! It has great ambiance. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"This place isn't bad but it's pricey and just not my style. The ambience is nice enough and the staff are attentive. We tried the beer battered delicata squash (bland and some were not entirely cooked through -- don't order this -- seriously), duck liver pate (tasty but the bread was strange), quinoa salad (good), duck (tender but strangely bland), and the burger (good). The space is very tight and it's moderately noisy. The service is friendly but a tad on the slow side."}
{"text":"Food was good but not remarkable. It lacked uniqueness and elegance with somewhat crude flavours and exaggerated base taste notes that lacked subtlety. The interior is business-like, not very cozy, service was fast and friendly. Interesting desserts. Good for a decent lunch. Perhaps I might give it another chance."}
{"text":"So I've been here several times over the last few months and would say quality of ingredients is top notch and the lunch prix fixe is fair. My fave is the mushroom fettucini, the sauce is not overly creamy and the mushrooms are quite earthy and yum. I've also enjoyed their burger but caution if you don't like juicy medium you may not enjoy this dish. 

As someone else pointed out the biggest issueis tight seating, but that's Toronto for you and my other beef is that I found the entrees a bit on the oily side and there isn't much variety, otherwise, the staff and food are great."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night with my husband and two friends for a 7:45pm seating.  It's a nice restaurant, but no need to dress up; we wore jeans and fit right in with the crowd.  

My husband ordered the Beef Carpaccio ($12) appetizer for his main course.  It was big enough to satisfy someone with a small appetite.  It was served with preserved artichokes, pine nuts, arugula, sunchoke chips, and olives.  The beef was very thinly sliced/shaved.

I ordered the Honey Glazed Duck ($26), which is served with cauliflower, roasted beets, pommes kennedy, and pickled romanesco.  Some of the cauliflower was undercooked, but the most caramelized pieces were delicious.  I loved the beets.  The duck leg was a little bit dry in the middle and I didn't get a strong honey flavor, but the fat was delicious and the meat was well seasoned.

Friend #1 ordered the Braised Beef Ravioli ($24), served with caramelized green beans, fried egg, and toscano cheese.  She really enjoyed her dish.  I thought it was good, but not mindblowing.

Friend #2 ordered the special of the night, which was the Beef Duo ($29).  This had beef rib eye and another cut of beef which I just cannot remember.  The dish was very good, probably the best dish of the night.  It was served with truffled grits that were incredibly fragrant and creamy.

We all shared the \"Chocolate Bar\" special for dessert ($9).  It was made with fried crepes, chocolate mousse, chocolate ganache, caramel, and a generous dusting of spiced beer nuts.  Sweet, light, well balanced, with great textural components.

I don't necessarily think this place is worth all the hype because none of the dishes were amazing or mind blowing, however, they were also not exceedingly expensive.  I don't think I would return, but I do not regret eating here.

Note: managed to get last minute (2 days in advance) weekend dinner reservations here by emailing, since their online reservation system didn't have tables available at the times we wanted."}
{"text":"Maybe my favorite restaurant in Toronto. I've been here 3-4 times, and it never dissappoints!
Great food, great atmosphere, great service, fair prices.

They are changing their menu pretty often, the best dish I had so far must have been the cold corn soup. Absolutely to die for!

can't wait to go back there."}
{"text":"Yum Yum and Yum (AND AND AND your wallet will not cry of despair). Richmond station is one of the most affordable and low key Toronto restaurants. They love to do everything in house, from cured meats to beer. They also make a mean Kombucha!

We got charcuterie (3), ricotta on foccacia, the burger, the black cod and the olive oil and lemon dessert. Charcuterie was a hit, everything is house cured and they have a large variety rotating with the seasons. Burger was fingerlicking good, dripping in juices and exploding in flavors. 

My favorite of all was the dessert, its was so fun with its contrast of textures and flavors. Each bite was a surprise and a burst of flavor, from the creamy olive oil cream, to the torched smoky sugar crackling, from the tart and fresh lemon curd to the refreshing and fragrant honey jelly."}
{"text":"Dinner here was exquisite. Ordered the Duck Duo, which was prepared expertly; the duck leg was rendered beautifully and extremely flavorful. Creative pairings with a variety of root vegetable preparations, all of which was delicious (and surprisingly very filling!) Cocktails were cleverly crafted and well balanced; good beer and wine menu as well. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Last night in Toronto and what a find!  Extremely attentive and knowledgeable server who gave us a detailed rundown of the menu and specials. She knew the ingredients and their impacts to the taste (coincidentally she's a recent chemical engineer grad). Her suggestion of their house burger with fries was spot on!  Exquisitely prepared bursting with flavors. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Had a chance to try this place after a long while of anticipation. Recommended by friends and peers as consistently inspired - on and off menu .

Seated as a 3 top walk in, tasting menu ($90pp at 9 courses) with cocktails. 
Service was standard, water top ups, qualitied for every course, intermittent crumbing, dishes described. 

Food was good in flavour, but I was expecting individual plates as opposed to a large format sharing tasting menu. Not that there was a problem... or that I didnt like sharing my plate... But it did make me question the value of each course from the food costing perspective.

Food notes:
- Third course, ricotta on focaccia + mushroom soup. Nice.
- Fourth course, seared black cod on too many carrots + hummus. It felt like someone had to empty their insert of cooked carrots for the end of the night (we were a late table)
- Seventh course, Popcorn apple crumble? The plate was dropped in my absence so I had to guess what I was eating. Great flavour balancing with all the components, but there was not enough of each component. There was too much ... crumble.. chunks to eat. Struggled. Server playfully suggested someone clear the plate. We finished it in a sad and reluctant manner.
- Ninth course, non existent. Apparently the chef decided our 7th course dessert was rich enough (hes not wrong) to conclude our dinner at the 8th course with macarons and toasted marshmallows. They reduced $15pp so its not necessarily a bad thing, just weird. Can only speculate that everyone wanted to go home and think about roasting less carrots.

Must also note that an individual in my party was feeling pretty ill (unrelated to the restaurant by any means) and it may have come off pretty scary for the serving staff, as he looked like he was dying at times. Our server wished this friend better as we left. Thank you.

I might forever wonder if it was the timing that ruined the results of my expectations at richmond station, but that experience was rich enough that I'm just not curious about coming back for my anticipated 9th course."}
{"text":"I've been to Richmond Station 5 times so far and I've NEVER been disappointed by their food and service. When you make a reservation they will put your number and name under their system so they will always remember your name. This extra effort makes the experience feel very personal and special.  

In terms of food, I'd highly recommend any sort of their specialized meat dishes like steaks and ducks. Medium rare meat cooked with their magically developed sauces and herbs make every bite an ecstatic experience. Their desserts are also thoughtfully executed with many surprising but delicious combinations of unusual ingredients. 

The atmosphere is rather casual but the taste of food trumps over all the other more expensive restaurant, which I'd choose not to criticize here.  

It's easily one of my absolute favourite restaurants in the city. Thank you for existing."}
{"text":"4.5 stars
Overall very good food, but I'm a bit confused about how to categorize the restaurant. It's actually much more casual than the reputation implies, and the food, while very good, isn't fine dining per se... But that's great, and the price point actually fits well with it.

Had the curried squash soup with coriander, which was quite good. Also had the fennel pierogies, which were amazing. The garnishes and sauces came together really well. Only bad thing was I was too full to order dessert!

All the staff were extremely friendly - attentive enough for this type of restaurant, but not constantly checking in; great for meeting friends or colleagues for dinner, but probably not a great ambience/setting for an intimate meal."}
{"text":"This restaurant has nice, clean, and modern decor with friendly staff...

First off, the complimentary bread was A-ok...could've been warmer. My friend ordered the Carbonara pasta that was the special of the day. It looked delicious, pretty loaded and her comments were pretty positive as well. On the other hand, another friend and I ordered the jerk chicken confit leg with sweet potato and spinach..either I expected too much or it was a let down. The chicken was really dry and a bit tasteless. At one point I wanted to stop eating it, though I didn't. The spinach and sweet potato were alright...tasted like what spinach and sweet potatoes regularly tastes like...pretty much the items on this dish were just the few items put onto the same plate, was kind of disappointed. 

However, when our bill came our server gave us some complimentary chocolate fudge pieces. I'm not a big fan of fudge and sweets but it tasted pretty good, not overly sweet. Nice how they do something different than other restaurants such as giving candies or fruits when the bill comes.

Overall from my experience, this is one of those restaurants that I'll simply say \"I've tried it\". Not bad, but nothing to rave about, nor nothing there attracts me to go back."}

So, young Chef Heinrich has been getting mixed reviews on his newly opened Richmond Station restaurant in the financial district. If you've watched Top Chef Canada, then you know who he is. If you haven't, then you are about to discover what he is all about and how Heinrich has raised to fame from his former Marben gig, to Top Chef Celebrity status and now to his new baby, Richmond Station.

Let's talk about Chef Heinrich for a minute, after all, he is a celebrity. Born and raised in Canada, specifically in Sooke, British Columbia; Carl has been cooking since he was 13 years old, accelerating his way to the top by walking the talk alongside renowned Chef Daniel Boulud in New York, season 1 Top Chef Canada winner Chef Dale MacKay in Vancouver; and lastly, landing a gig as executive chef at Marben in Toronto which put him on the radar and placed him on Top Chef Canada.

So what makes him so special? These days, his fame, others his robotic skills in the kitchen. Being one of Heinrich's biggest fans during Season 2 of Top Chef Canada, I realized he's not the type of chef that will create from scratch, but instead, re-create on his own terms. Robotic, as in, exactly as; other times, from the heart. The food at Richmond Station is a testament to this notion.

Richmond Station's menu is predictable. When I visited this hip and trendy restaurant, whose set-up reminded me of Marben (remember, re-create?), I knew right away, even before trying the food, that I will be in for a treat, just a treat I've tasted before. Like the polenta fries with house-made ketchup, nice and crunchy deep-fried cornmeal-style french fires. Delectable on the palate, with the right amount of salt. Cooked perfectly, no sogginess, no crumbly effect. The same polenta fries you'd try at one of the Oliver & Bonacini restaurants, just made a tad bit better, with locally-sourced, fresh ingredients.

The wild boar ragu, a braised boar shoulder brought in from Stratford, slow cooked for a day. Almost too cooked for my taste. However the flavours were all there, bringing in comfort to one's taste buds via an al dente orecchiette pasta, in a juicy tomato broth topped with toscana cheese and celery. Does Woodlot's wild boar pappardelle ring a bell? Indeed it does.

And then there is the infamous Marben-style burger, the Stn. Burger. A tremendously juice-dripping slider-style burger with braised short rib enveloped in a beef patty, cooked medium-rare with aged cheddar and beet chutney. This one re-creation is close to perfect, though not quite like Marben's.

And that brings us to Chef Heinrich's one creation, the decadent, mouth-watering S'mores dessert. The beautifully assembled, delectable soft and sikly chocolate flouerless cake is placed on a bed of red wine cranberry coulis, slightly sandwiched between the S'mores concoction, then blow-torched prior to arriving at the table. Now this, exactly like this, I have not tasted before.

So, do I recommend Chef Heinrich's food? Damn right I do! Just because one can't create, does not mean one does not have the skills to re-create. After all, Toronto needs more re-creation, anything to get us out of this chain restaurants era we're living in.

Buen Provecho, 
Viviana."}
{"text":"Came here on Friday for dinner. We sat at the chef's table where you face the open kitchen so that you can see chefs cooking while eating at the same time. It was a good experience overall. Their menu is original and interesting which made the decision harder. Check out their daily specials! My boyfriend and I both ended up ordering specials for that night. 
Check out their website for the menu since they change it frequently. 

Overall, very attentive and friendly service, solid food, and great ambience."}
{"text":"I went here last weekend with a friend before the Leafs game. The food is good, but it's not worth the slow service. The tables are too crammed together and it's hard to have a conversation without the people next to you hearing every word you say even when speaking with a low voice. I think it's overpriced for the service and atmosphere. Not going back ."}
{"text":"I was here once with my girlfriend. It's a pretty modern Canadian style food. It fusions into a few different culture streams. For the price you are paying, you kind of expect this level of service and food. We tried the tasting menu. Everything comes in really small portion so don't worry that it'll soon fill you up. Enjoy it slowly."}
{"text":"Strong 3.5 - definitely worth a try.

We went for our anniversary - and my husband thought booking the chef's table would mean that it was exclusive / special - instead it is a long bar facing the kitchen - my take - extra cool for a regular night, especially if you are foodie, but not as exclusive as others in the city.  Food was creative, delicious and had some great crowd pleasers - The burger is a must.

Loved that they have made a hot spot in a new zone downtown, but hard to figure on where to go after dinner - basically need to cab to queen or King..."}
{"text":"Oh, can't believe I haven't posted a review for this place. 

Initially when I heard the hype about this resto, I was a bit skeptical. Then a friend went for a work dinner and raved about it so I decided to give it try. My order was cider beer and the Stn. Burger w/ lettuce, beet chutney, aged cheddar, milk bun, rosemary fries, dill pickle. Burger was pretty good! Yum. 

This place is kinda pricy but if you want to splurge for a special occasion or maybe cause you have the \"company credit card\"...lol.. Give this place a go! Just make sure you have reservations. I didn't and had to wait over 40mins. Plus I saw 2 women who came in after me with no reservations being seated before me. That was kind of annoying, hence the 1 star off. Lol"}
{"text":"Had the lunch special of tomato soup and halibut cake. It was good. Attentive service. Enjoyed the whimsical \"Skittles cake\" for dessert."}
{"text":"The hotel concierge suggested this restaurant as a dinner option, but for whatever reason, initially, this place just wasn't calling to me. But then, as I was walking around and trying to decide on somewhere to eat for for lunch, I said (to myself) \"what the heck\" and went in. I'm very glad I did. I got a spot at the counter. After looking at the menu and some consultation with my well-informed server, I opted for their burger, accompanied by a side pear and pecan salad and a curried soup special (I want to say it was sweet potato--that's what I get for writing the review a few weeks later).

In any case, everything was delicious. The soup was just what I needed, the burger was cooked to a perfect medium rare, with cheddar cheese and a beet chutney (yum), and the salad was fab in its own right and a superb match for the burger. Service was warm and welcoming, the atmosphere is bustling and pleasant.

In short, Richmond Station isn't four and a half stars rounded up out of generosity of spirit. At least on this occasion, it's exactly what Yelp's five-star rating is for. I look forward to dining there again on a future visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"It all started with me yelping my way to find a nice restaurant to celebrate my good friend's birthday in style. Oh, what's that? You take reservations for a party of 7 and we can be seated in private dinning area in front of charcuterie fridge with hanging meats? Count me in!

This place was interesting from the beginning and I'll recommend booking online for reservations or calling in early for a larger party, ask for the kick-ass private dining space! Our sever was kind enough to walk us through the entire menu, and introduce some lovely items not featured on the menu. Seeing how we were struggling with our decisions on appetizers, she fixed us up a sampler flight for our group ( $10 pp ). The hamburger was made well, tasted like a extremely flavourful aged steak! The muscovy duck was also good but I'd go with some of the daily items, burger or other favourites. That's just me because I love Peking duck and any other form of duck will always be second lol. 

Don't forget to order a refreshing cocktail(s) with your meal. We couldn't resist but to have a few rounds! If you have room, dessert will usually come deconstructed, like you always see in a melodramatic master chef challenge. It'll push your favourites to new levels, apple crumble with cheddar cheese ice cream! 

It was a great experience and we thoroughly enjoyed our time here. We will be back and look forward to the ever-changing menu!"}
{"text":"Absolutely and positively one of the best burgers I've ever experienced short of it being homemade."}
{"text":"Totally overpriced and pretentious. I wouldn't recommend unless you have money to burn."}
{"text":"This restaurant was highly recommended by a friend, so I decided to give it a try. The food was decent, but I've definitely had it better. Furthermore, it took quite long for the main courses to come. So be prepared to wait and don't go when you're starving!"}
{"text":"Wow! Best meal we've had in a loooong time. Finally got to enjoy this joint after seeing our Toronto friends rave about it on Facebook time after time. Four of us enjoyed the chef's tasting menu, which was 6 courses (we ended up with 7) and a wonderful server named Admin. 

I started with the winter spiced Manhattan, which was warming but could still taste the whiskey -- perfect. I don't like when my booze don't taste like booze. The tartar starter was excellent. The best course may well have been the salads, of which they brought 4 different ones and we split them all at the table. The Brussels sprout salad was delicious! The polenta fries with truffle aoli were scintillating. I could have eaten a trough of just those. The charcuterie board was pretty standard, but was a nice palette cleanser in the middle of the meal. Agnolotti with a slice of pork was up next, and the cream sauce was succulent and savory. The beef tenderloin with black beans over green chili sauce was a special that night, and they included it as the final course in our tasting menu. Save some of your bread to sop up what's left in the pan!

As an added bonus, Admin brought us the Station burger (2, actually, cut in half). This. Thing. Was. Amazing. Totally lived up to the hype. The beet chutney really makes it pop.

The desserts were appreciated but not a highlight of the experience. Rye & Ginger, and the Hawker Centre. Very creative ingredients, but I could have gone for a chocolate cake or ice cream after leaving. I really can't detract for this, as they just didn't resonate with me personally. 

Absolutely top-notch overall, can't wait to return."}
{"text":"My new favourite restaurant in Toronto.
Celebrated a friend's birthday last night.  We were a group of 5 and it was all our first time. We informed the hostess that it is our first time and she was very informative of the menu as well as the features. She suggested the tasting menu so we are able to try different things, and no worries if you have your heart set on a certain item.. they will incorporate that as well. We informed her that we wanted to try the Polenta Fries, the Kobe beef tartare  and the Quinoa salad.
We definitely made the right choice. For $65 pp we had about 7 courses! We had oysters, Polenta Fries (A MUST order!!!), Kobe Beef Tartare, Quinoa salad with Trout, Another salad with Pork Belly, Halibut in tomato cream soup broth, Paperdelle pasta with beef bolognese,  beef dish in a pot with hollandaise sauce, potatoes and veggies and dessert. It was absolutely an EPIC meal!!!!!!! Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience (food, drinks, desert, service, ambiance).  Everything we ordered was fantastic."}
{"text":"Their Duck Liver Pate is a must! There is a very charming private pantry table in the back of the restaurant as well as bar seats that face the kitchen allowing you front row seats to the chefs \"show\".

The Mushroom Angnolotti is amazing with Swiss chard, hen of the woods mushrooms, walnut pangrattato and tamari butter. The whole dish is packed with flavor, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This has been on my \"must try\" list for quite some time - strong Yelp reviews along with hotel conceirge recommendations.  Went on a quiet Monday night and it did not disappoint.
Food:
Starter - Smoked Trout. $13. Daily special with smoked trout on a bed of cream sauce and winter veggies.  The sauce is light as foam and the trout was done first nations jerky-style.  Very yummy! This was my favorite dish of the evening. 
Main - Rabbit Two Ways. $27. Tender rabbit meat prepared in 2 styles.  Think it was fried and baked (Wished I took better notes...). Regardless, they were delicious and juicy. This was a great winter dish and matched well with an Argentinian Malbec.
Dessert - Hawker Centre. $11. A sorbet flavoured with a Singapore flair - scent of Pandan leaves along with sesame brittle and a hint of fish sauce. This was rather creative but may not suit the unadventurous.  I liked.
Service - Typical of a restaurant of this caliber.  Dress code is casual (i.e., jeans) but some chose to glamour up. Not pretentious. 
Overall - Glad to find a quality and \"non-touristy\" dining experience in the heart of downtown. This is one fine restaurant and deserving of a 4.5 Star rating.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"The Rickey Baker is probably the best cold tea I've ever had. Highly recommend it. I had the grilled steak special that they had featured. Perfectly cooked with a strong supporting cast of fresh veggies."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for our four year anniversary. We reserved our table online. When we arrived to Richmond Station, we didn't have to wait more than five minutes for the table and were promptly brought to our seats. When our server found out this was an anniversary dinner, she gave us each a complimentary glass of champagne and I thought that was very nice. I have heard so many great things about Richmond Station so I was really anticipating good food here, and yes they did deliver!

We ordered:
Confit lamb croquette salad
Smoked wings with blueberry bbq sauce
Stn burger
Lamb merguez pasta
Fruit roll up

The lamb croquette salad was AMAZING. I am not a salad person but I must say, it was done so well. The smoked wings were pretty good but I couldn't tell that the sauce was made with blueberries. Their stn burger was to die for. My boyfriend and I love our burgers and we thought it was one of the best in Toronto. The lamb pasta was flavourful as well. Their desserts are so creative and a must try! Food and service here are excellent, can't find a reason not to give them 5 stars! I told my coworker about this place after my experience and he took his girlfriend here as well, and they loved it also!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't be confused by the name.  This is not dive or shabby quick stop burger joint...

Me and a coworker walked 9 miles that day, getting lost through Toronto.  It was a bit chilly, we were exhausted and had plans after dinner of a night of clubbing and a full travel day the next morning.  I left it up to my coworker to find our first dinner in Toronto together via Yelp.  I was a bit leery because the first restaurant  for breakfast was a food court in a mall.  Glad to say this was the farthest thing from it...

They greeted us warmly at the door despite walking in around the time of closing on a Saturday night.  They sat us immediately and comfortably after the host engaged us in a long and genuine conversation.

We started off with the tempura baby bok choy.  I am a frequent eater of bok choy and have never had it prepared that way.  It was absolutely delicious which is hard to do...

Our kind waitress then hooked us up with free appetizers: fried polenta and some other dish I forgot but couldn't get enough of!  

Our waitress then suggested that I get the night's special, the duck and my coworker ordered braised beef ravioli.  Both were AMAZING, but I have to say I had the best plate of the evening...

I had never had duck prepared so well...It was almost like a prime rib steak: cook a bit rare but warm and the skin on the outside was crisp but still had the perfect level of fat.  I am used to eating duck fried or baked like a chicken, never this way...I'm afraid I'll never be able to enjoy duck again because it won't be as good as when I had it here at Richmond Station!  

The red wine, also suggested by the waitress, was also a perfect pair.

On top of this, we had a sweet wine, compliments of the bar.  

As if the night couldn't get better, a few other waitresses came over to have some more lighthearted conversation and suggested a few places we should visit in Toronto.  I didn't expect to get such kind service at a place that was cleaning up as walked in and with food of this quality.  Our waitress then wrote this all on a post card and gave us a few more postcards to take home as souvenirs.  

As if the night couldn't get better, our waitress, after handing us our postcards, called one of the chefs over and asked if he could whip up a nice desert for us.  With no special requests, we asked him to surprise us and he brought out a chocolate cake desert with a smile.

As far as the restaurant decor, it's a cool, cozy yet still very trendy place.  I would recommend it to any and everyone traveling in Toronto.  It's been a few weeks since I've visited and have thought of leaving a review almost every day since my visit.  I didn't get around to when I wanted to, but late is better than never.  In fact, I made a damn yelp so that I could appreciate the experience I had at Richmond Station.  The length of this review should tell you enough!  It was a perfect Canadian welcome and I can't wait to go back.  Thanks guys at Richmond Station!"}
{"text":"Was taken here for my birthday. This had been on my to-go list for awhile but just kept on delaying due to everyone's busy schedules. Finally birthday dinners come around my corner, and it all works.

I really enjoyed dining here, we arrived on a Friday evening and it was packed with people. The restaurant is not that big and with the construction on the roads, it was a little difficult to find. The prices were reasonable for the quality in food and service. We were checked up upon in within reasonable times, pouring our wine (noticing our glasses) and everything else worked very well together.

This place will work for dates, gathering with friends and anything else you can think of...our dinner had great food, ambience and service. I would recommend this place without any doubts!"}
{"text":"Richmond Station is a is a great place for taking a person on a date as long as they aren't a heavy eater. The atmosphere is very good, music creates a good mood and the lighting is just right. 

Of course, the food is extremely well prepared and it is definitely up there in terms of the price point. The only problem was that I felt the Beef two way entree (what i ordered) was a bit small considering for $29.

The Beef two-ways, which was a braised beef and seared steak, was really good, but portions were small. The sides consisted of potatoes and veggies. The potatoes it came with was...orgasmic? Never had it done that way and I'll be sure to try experimenting it at home. And the veggies were cooked very well. The accompanying sauces/purees was really good, but the braised beef was much more flavorful and complemented the sauce a lot better than the seared one. Seared steak didn't have as much juice as I hoped, but I would say that's probably because they served the steak to you already sliced instead letting you cut a piece by yourself. All in all, still good. I would highly recommend that at least one side be accompanying the entrees. The place is still super busy, so you can get away with it, but I would have liked to at least have had a soup/salad for a $29 entree. But it was definitely a high quality dish.

Still...everytime I hear that they have good burgers, i end up getting something else because it was their daily special. I think to solve this problem, I need to come here for lunch and dinner...unless they change the menu in between, in which case, I need to starve myself first and then eat two dinners. :3

{"text":"We went there on a Saturday evening without reservation and that was a mistake. Looked like everybody had a reservation but four of us. Even sitting at the bar was reserved. Luckily the super nice host eventually could manage a table for us. We had Oysters on the Half Shell, Daily Soup and Stn. Burger. Everything tasted very fresh. The burger was very juicy and delicious. The service was stellar."}
{"text":"Unbelievable small restaurant serving locally-sourced high quality meats using unique complex preparations with fabulous results. Our beef cut wasn't even on the menu so it was butchered and prepared to order, and garnished with mix of flavorful tender seasonal vegetables. Side order layered broccoli with roasted cauliflower florets, and a green homemade ranch sauce as a sub to blue cheese. Great cocktails - Never had such a nuanced Negroni and wine selection we picked was a great Italian Nebbiolo. Definitely going back next time in town."}
{"text":"I guess as close to the perfect lunch as I can recall..
Immediately seated, waitress respected my situation (short lunch). Latte was great, the station burger possibly the best I've had in the city.  No long waiting, friendly..
Thank you RICHMOND STATION, look forward to returning.."}
{"text":"We came here for a bimonthly dinner we have.  It was good, we needed a reservation which is pretty hard to organize when you have 6+ people to arrange for.  They were very accommodating the dinner was amazing.

Everything was beautifully plated.  I had a lobster pasta, and it was great!

Definitely worth dropping in."}
{"text":"By far the best meal I've had this year! I've been wanting to come here since it opened and the opportunity finally came up when our friends were visiting from Vancouver. I called on Tuesday and tried to get a reservation for 9:30pm on a Friday but no such luck. I was sitting at my desk on Wednesday afternoon and decided to try again.... and to my surprise, they were able to accommodate me. That just completely made my day!

At 9:30, I walked into a restaurant filled with people, food, in a lovely space with high ceilings and a lovely wall full of wine. There was one of those ladders you see on TV shows and musicals where people can climb onto, slide across the wall and grab their bottle of choice. It was really classy. As I look down the restaurant and into the kitchen, I was hoping I would spot chef Carl.... and when I did, I smiled to myself because I have always loved his food way back to when he worked at Marben.

Anyways.. back to the food (as I am currently starstruck)! One of the things I have been reading about were their polenta fries. There was no way I was going to miss out on this and they were delicious. The fries were the perfect amount of crispiness and not over fried. The aioli was creamy and the perfect amount of spice, while the tomato ketchup was fresh and flavourful. We also shared the beet salad which was a world of flavours that exemplified sweetness, bitterness, saltiness and creaminess (from the cheese) showing the overall complexity of this dish, but presented beautifully without being over pretentious.

I've been reading the RS menu for quite some time... and on tonight's menu... there was a new item that I had not seen before - the ALMONDINE TROUT - sous vide trout with celeriac puree... I have never eaten anything sous vide before so I was very excited to try this. It was heavenly at first bite. The fish was perfectly cooked, soft in the centre where you can see the change in colour from the exterior to the interior. The celeriac puree was a smooth consistency creamy as ever. The vegetables added texture and flavour profiles that were pure perfection. I cannot rave enough about how delicious it was.

We were all full by the end of this but we wanted to share a dessert... and the cracker jack dessert it was... after all.. how often do you get to try POPCORN ICECREAM!?!?! I was skeptical about this but who would have thunk that the ice cream tasted EXACTLY popcorn? The dessert was separated into 4 evenly pieces that we could all get the full experience out of. Brittle was crunchy, and the dessert was salty, sweet, the whole package and a perfect way to end the night.

OK i need to go back pronto. 'Nuff said.

Carl Heinrich.... you are sooooo talented !"}
{"text":"Super leckeres Essen, sehr guter Service mit freundlicher Bedienung und elegant angenehmer Atmosphäre. Falls ich mal wieder nach Toronto gehe, werde ich auf jeden Fall wieder hingehen. Die Preise sind in Ordnung, denn die Qualität ist super."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a friend and based on the Yelp reviews could not wait to try it out. Went with my gf and 2 friends and Sad to say I was very disappointed. We got a bunch of different things to eat to be able to try as much as we could. We tried the charcuterie, the cheese plate, the beet salad (which was definitely the best part of the dinner), the bass (too salty and nothing special), rainbow trout (undercooked and there was just too much going on),the scallop special (which was also very good, but like the trout, just too many flavours and textures), and ended with the pumpkin tart (good but again too complicated), whoopee pie (no one at the table liked it) and the dessert with hay flavoured ice team - again not great. 

Service was quite good, restaurant is nice, but not a place we will be coming back to.

I will add that both me and my gf felt a bit sick afterwards and into this morning."}
{"text":"I came here after seeing good ratings for the restaurant. Its a popular restaurant so I advise coming early to get a seat without waiting. Me and my friend ordered a few appetizers and the station burger. All the appetizers were decent but our favorite dish was the burger. The burger patty was juicy and tasty, we both enjoyed it very much."}
{"text":"So disappointed with this restaurant! I went yesterday with my husband, I read the reviews and was so excited. I ordered the fix menu $22. The portions were ridiculous small! The food nothing great. My husband ordered the swordfish stew, and it was terrible!! It was a soup not a stew! 
The beet soup, quinoa salad and terrine were just OK.  
Definitely don't be back."}
{"text":"Words cannot express how phenomenal our experience was at this restaurant! The ambiance, the service, THE ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS food! I am speechless! Every bite was super satisfying! We sat at the chef's table which is basically a long table overlooking the kitchen. It was like watching a food network show live!!!! Talented, knowledgeable staff with impeccable attention to quality and detail! We plan on coming back monthly to taste every item on the menu! We ordered the ricotta toast, tasty toasts, agnolotti stuffed with sweet potato, halibut special and the maple walnut dessert special! WOW! :)"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  Richmond Station is conveniently located behind The Bay on Richmond Street, downtown Toronto.  We went for lunch and was \"forced\" to sit at the bar since there was no table seating at 12:15 PM (good sign, in my opinion).  I had the prix-fixed lunch of the carrot ginger soup -- which was velvety in texture and simply delicious and the entree was their pot roast, which had slices of nice meat atop a parsnip puree with accompanying gardiniere and roasted fingerling potatos.  My husband had the Station Burger, which at first glance is smaller in appearance than your typical burger, but it was just the right size in the end.  The accompanying fries were very well cooked as well.  The cracker jack dessert is THE dessert to order -- a sticky toffee pudding, crushed peanut brittle and popcorn ice cream.  YUM!  I have to say, though, the best thing about our experience there was meeting Chef Carl Heinrich, a total cutiepie winner from Top Chef Canada Season 2, and sitting right next to us, was a current contender for the current Top Chef Canada Season 3.  Chef Carl came out of the kitchen just to say hello and meet an adoring fan (me) and he couldn't have been more charming.  The staff at Richmond Station is also what will keep me going back for more.  Attentive, efficient and kind.  This place has everything going for it."}
{"text":"Came here on a weeknight. It has a very chill vibe - would be fantastic for a date and for some late night drinks.

Got sat at a type of communal bench near the front of the restaurant. Don't be fooled, there's a whole other section at the exact of the rest aunt with tables and such! The kitchen is very open concept, you can see everything inside. 

Something I found cool was they give you tours of their restaurant. It's neat; nothing spectacular but I guess different 

Salads were light, nothing too heavy. Burgers are sooooooo scrumptious though. Juicy, meaty and something you can't naturally fit in your mouth (heh). The bun is soft, like a marshmallow, and like it should be. 

Service: decent. I found that when I came in looking like a student (which I totally am, but I resembled a typical student with a heavy backpack, ponytail and eyebags to match that day) I felt like I got shafted to the side a bit and forgotten. Maybe that was just me though. 

Ambiance: uber cosy. Great for dates. 

Overall, I would give it another try. Lots of my friends love this place despite my experience from the service (eyebags are gross I know, but still)."}
{"text":"4.5 stars for my lunch experience.

I had always wanted to try Richmond Station.  Thanks to my colleague who suggested a lunch there.  

It was so cool to sit in front of the open kitchen overseeing the chefs preparing our food.  The space was a bit tight between tables but the service was friendly and very professional.  The prix-fixe lunch menu ($21 two courses) might be a bit pricey for my lunch budget but worth the quality and service for sure.  Besides, it was a treat from my colleague:-).  We paid an extra $5 for a dessert each and it was the best I had this recently.

A very satisfying weekday lunch indeed."}
{"text":"I came into this place with sky high expectations upon reading their resume. I was not disappointed to say the least. This is definitely one of those rare, hyped up restaurants that actually kinda lives up to the hype.

The meat was well cooked and all the components on the place worked cohesively in harmony. Flavour wise, again, everything just works well. Nothing is overpowering, nor too acidic..spicy..etc. One little quibble was that the fish is slightly overcooked, it could of been more tender.

With all the hype about the fantastic desserts, I was a little underwhelmed. The cheesecake component was a little too crumbly for my liking. Maybe because of the de-constructive approach they used but I find the desserts a bit lacking in terms really rounding out the whole meal. It wasn't as satisfying as I had expect it.

The service is friendly and very attentive despite a packed dining room. Definitely worth a revisit but hopefully they can improve on their desserts a bit."}
{"text":"Service is excellent and on top of special requests, go out of the way for customers to make their night enjoyable, and explain the dishes really well.
Love the open kitchen and the burger plate was tasty. Not quite worth $22, but it was good.
The menu sounds fun, but the execution wasn't all there. Menu was almost kind of bleh. Especially the desserts."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to Richmond Station for dinner and we both loved it! :) 
5 stars goes out to the quality of food and service. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive to our table.

We ordered the TASTING MENU, the chef chooses your dishes for the night and surprise you :) When you order, the waitress will ask if you have any food allergies / things you would not want as part of the chef choices. I requested not to include blue cheese / goat cheese :P

DRINKS:
WHITES - NV RONDINELLA BIANCO \"IL BIANCO\" x 2

OYSTERS ON THE HALF SHELL (5/5)
(house condiments, horseradish, lemon)
Mmm.. so yummy and fresh! Great light start to our tasting menu.

CRISPY POLENTA FRIES (5/5)
(truffled aioli, parmigiano, chives)
This is my favourite dish out of the tasting menu. The fries were delicious - very crispy on the outside. My favourite part of this is the truffled aioli - LOVED it!!

MARINATED TOMATO SALAD (5/5)
(red pepper puree, garlic croutons, arugula, cucumber, red wine vinaigrette)
I'm not a big fan of tomato salads.. but this got me like D:!! I really want to know how to make the red wine vinaigrette for this salad. It was light but flavourful. After you finish, it leaves you feeling healthier haha. Also, the garlic croutons were huge!

MUSHROOM AGNOLOTTI (4/5)
(summer greens, truffled goats cheese, basil, pickled shiitake, fried sourdough)
The display of the agnolotti pasta was pretty. Placed on a hot plate - kept the pasta nice and hot. One big pasta roll was enough because we were already getting a bit full from the previous chef selections (actually maybe only I was getting full, my boyfriend eats a lot haha).

GRILLED SALMON (4/5)
(asparagus purée, beans, asparagus)
Crispy on the outside and tender in the inside. Loved the asparagus purée pairing because it wasn't too thick and it doesn't cover the freshness of the salmon flavour.

DUCK CONFIT (5/5)
(onions, radish, house sauce)
Whatever they marinated the duck confit with, it was so good. Usually when it's marinated, it becomes too salty, but this duck confit was perfect. The onions and radish for the sides also made it a good palette cleanser.

DESSERT:
CINNAMON & ORANGE SORBET (5/5)
I always look forward to the dessert menu at Richmond Station because they never disappoint me! For the tasting menu, the dessert was a cinnamon and orange sorbet. I'm personally not a big fan of oranges (I don't hate it though), but they made the orange sorbet so good!! There was a great mix of texture as well. There's a combination of crunchy cookie bits and nuts, meringue and whip cream-like sauce. So yummy!! 

Will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"All the food was amazing.  Had the following:
Seared tuna appie on nor chips
Steak tartare
Grilled pork chop

{"text":"Nice casual place with good quality food. The bar is pretty decent and makes some good cocktails. 

This is a good place to go to after work or for a quick meal if you want high quality food and ingredients. The place is a bit small so you may have to wait if you are going during peak timing."}
{"text":"Amazing experience and unique food choices.  Will be back! Make reservations ahead, this place is always full!"}
{"text":"Nice food, tasty cocktails, great service. I went there with a friend, and it was a very relaxing and sweet experience. Highly recommended for a classy yet informal night out in a comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service in a casual and tasteful atmosphere. The appetizer and entree courses were exceptional."}
{"text":"A friend of mine was going to moving across the world, and we wanted to have a nice dinner before his send off.  We had both been wanting to try Richmond Station for awhile so we made reservations on a Monday evening.  Even on a weekday, you NEED reservations for this place (usually a good sign).

When you first look at the restaurant, it looks quite small.  It certainly isn't a huge space, but I didn't realize there was actually another room off to the side at the back, near the kitchen. 
 We got a seat at the chef's table, which is a row of about 6-8 chairs that look right into the kitchen.  The server attends to you from the kitchen as the seats are quite tight.

This was really worth the wait.  I couldn't be more impressed with this place.  The food, the libations and service.  To eat my friend and I each ordered the bacon and tomato salad which was on special that night.  It was fresh, beautifully presented and packed with flavour.  We both wanted to try the famous burger and trout so we split the meals.  Both of them were delicious.  The burger was smaller than I expected, but the flavour was on point.  If you're looking for a burger with a huge beef patty, then this is not the burger for you.  It highlights the flavours of the beets, garlic aioli and bun.  The generous portion of fries on the side were crispy and flavourful.  The trout was also presented beautifully and full of flavour.  To end the evening, my friend and I split the strawberry and chocolate dessert.  There were different textures, a great pairing of tastes and a great way to finish off our meal.    

The server was excellent.  He was charming, attentive and very knowledgeable about the food, both the items on the menu, the specials and where the ingredients came from.  

The librations were creative and tasty as well.  I had the Fino Sangria, which was so refreshing and delicious."}
{"text":"This burger is probably one of the best I've ever had. It's absolute perfection. The meat is great quality, the toppings are not overwhelming and allow you to really savor the meat. The bun compliments the flavor as all the juices soak into the bread. Also they suggest eating the burger over the fries, so that all the juices from the meat are on the fries. 

The Fries are also delicious. Super crispy and the dipping sauce is AMAZING. I love the atmosphere and service here. Would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite restaurant in town. Have been here three times and for sure going for my fourth. Their burger is simply amazing, haven't tried anything like it before, the rabbit three ways is also really good; and the cocktails are just a must when you are here... they make the lock for the perfect night! Don't forget their desserts, the banana bread with peanut butter ice cream was out of this world!!!!"}
{"text":"One of those elusive perfect restaurant experiences. A beautiful evening and a good memory to treasure. We arrived sans reservation but it was a blizzardy night and we were hoping someone would bail because of the snow. Of course someone did. Thank goodness for all the weather wimps in this town. We scored a nice table for two without too much of a wait. 
Cocktails were bang on. Our waitress was pleasant and helpful. For some reason our food took a bit longer than you would expect. We weren't too bothered about it. Even so, the manager came over to apologize and that goes a long way these days. When our order did arrive, our first bite made it worth the wait."}
{"text":"On any given day Richmond Station is probably the best restaurant in town - unpretentious,  great food, expert staff. To avoid disappointment book a week or so ahead."}
{"text":"My go to restaurant. I always bring people here because the food is dependably fantastic, the service is wonderful and professional, and the desserts are killer."}
{"text":"Very impressed. They use the whole animal, make their own charcuterie in house. I went for a good meal, sat in their chef window, and liked it enough to take 6 friends back a few night later. Their burger deserves to be talked about as one of the best ever, everything on their tasting menu was top notch."}
{"text":"Absolutely top drawer prix-fixe lunch. Our meal included a phenomenal lentil soup and an amazing sandwich. Their \"Thai Lemonade\" was the perfect accompaniment.

The menu, not even considering the specials, was simple and not overwhelming. Far better, it seems, to do a few things really well than trying to do a lot of stuff alright.

With the set lunch menu, dessert can be added for $5, which brings the price down to a reasonable level given how small the portions are (though they're incredible). 

While I didn't have any wine, one of my companions raved about their excellent selection, including a lot of by-the-glass options. Definitely a good thing. 

Long story short, a place I will happily return to."}
{"text":"Went here this past Saturday night (2 days ago) - It was really good, but it is kind of pricy and the portions are not the largest.. 

Came in at around 9:30 without a reservation - called in about 10 minutes before ( I live walking distance) - sat down in about 3 minutes from arriving.. 

Waitress was very freindly and informative of the choices / way things work there being our 1st time. 

We had the tempura boc choy as an appitizer, it was very good (special of the day)

I had the beef ravioli, and the 2 other people I was with had the duck, also very good.. We opted to also get the polenta fries, it was okay.. 

The sourdough bread, and the dipping sauce they give you is highly addicitive!! It was very good! 

I had a beer, and the people I was with had a rasberry lemonde which was very tasty.. For desert I had a crackerjack pastry dish with ice cream that at first was not that good, but after a couple of bits was awesome, but I was done it with then :( lol

It was about $70 each person after it was all said and done.. Awesome food, but a little pricy.."}
{"text":"Great service, excellent tastes, and fantastic plating. The cocktails and desserts leave something to be desired. Came for a celebration with a friend and we shared 2 cocktails (meh), 2 apps (tasty!), 2 mains (excellent!), and 3 desserts (meh).

Drinks: a coffee-esque drink and an apple-cinnamon drink. Both were underflavoured and nothing special. Pricey at $14-16.

Apps: Charcuterie board (aww yisssss delicious!), and some hushpuppies (crunchy, savoury, meaty).

Mains: Scallops were perfectly seared and tender. The trout was flaky, and so so light, with an excellently crispy skin. Perfect in complement to the deep flavours of the roasted red peppers and the capers.

Dessert: The red velvet dessert was interesting for sure (they take out the red from the red velvet and instead recreate it in a beet puree). A mix of bitter and semi-sweet soft textures. Not my cup of tea but I appreciate the innovation. The wild rice krispies dish looks nice and is tasty, but in essence, it's like eating whole wheat rice krispies. Chinese supermarkets pack these things into plastic wraps and sell for pennies! Plating was real nice though :) Also packed a panna cotta which was pretty tasty and nicely hinted with black pepper.

Overall, a good experience. I'll be back (for the apps and mains)!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the service and food quality of this restaurant. I've had the best beef tartar and sole dish here and the staff were very friendly and quick with their service. They also have this tasting menu where 10 different dishes are served for around $70 pp which to me is a very reasonable price point for what you get. Overall very pleased with the atmosphere and food!"}
{"text":"Little did I know that I would be eating the best burger that I've ever had in Toronto.  I decided at literally the last minute to come here for dinner.  It was 5:00p and I was already starving, so I figured I'd walk over and try my chances at getting a spot.  They were able to accommodate me at the Chef's Table, which is an awesome counter where you get a full view into the kitchen.  As a solo diner, this was honestly perfect and made the dining experience really fun.

Then came the menu.  It was incredibly diverse and extensive which was at first rather intimidating.  The waiter helped me out with navigating the menu and recommended that I get their special, scallop crudo, and their burger.  I'm not going to lie, I was incredibly skeptical of getting a burger since I'm pretty picky about burgers, but I had read about how many awards it had gotten and decided that I had to have it.  Scallop crudo was very good, but the burger stole the show.  It was seriously the best burger I have ever eaten.  Perfectly balanced flavors, super juicy... I legitimately contemplated ordering another one to go so that I could eat a second burger later.

In short, I highly recommend this spot.  Definitely make a reservation especially if you aren't eating at a grandma hour like me.  Get the burger. Just do it."}
{"text":"The BEST burger I've had in Toronto. Enough said. I've heard and about Richmond Station in many blogs and food posts and finally decided to make a lunch reservation. My friend and I didn't walk in with any expectations, but when the burger arrived, we were blown away. The meat is so soft and tender, it's unreal (I hear they source their own meats). Served in a classy Staub pan, you know this is going to be quality. The burgers are regular size and served with fries. I can't see anyone giving it less than a 5 star. Reservation recommended, although they have bar seating for walk-ins. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Wow. What an amazing restaurant. My favourite dining experience in Toronto so far. 

$21 prix fixe for lunch is a steal. I had quinoa salad and it was delicious. My friends had burgers and they are the best we've had in Toronto.

The waiter was delightful and very helpful. Directed us quickly to some suggestions which turned out fantastic

Bathroom was super clean and beautiful."}
{"text":"I think this is one if not my new favourite restaurant in Toronto. I did the tasting menu and loved everything. Desert is not something to miss - try the cracker jack dessert with peanut brittle and popcorn ice cream."}
{"text":"Went here last year for the tasting menu and thought it was fantastic. Highly recommend it. Prob ended up being 2-3 hours for a 8-10 course (don't remember exactly) tasting that didn't leave you over stuffed but just the right amount with a good taste of each dish."}
{"text":"This would be my first time at this restaurant. Food was great and service was exceptional. 

We were seated in front of their open view kitchen which was a bonus. 

I ordered the Lamb Merguez Pasta which was great. However, there was a bit too much citrus flavour which I usually don't mind. My dish was not as hot as I would have liked it to be (reason for 4 stars instead of 5). 

My friend ordered the Lamb Neck Croquettes. The dish was amazing. All the different flavours complemented eachother but did not over power the lamb. 

We shared the Milk Chocolate Pudding which was incredible. I really enjoyed the basil ice cream. I was afraid that the basil would be overpowering. I was not disappointed! 

Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who are looking for a delicious meal with great service."}
{"text":"The food was really good. My hamburger was really juicy, but a bit less cooked than I had asked for. It's really creative cooking, and the chefs are really nice. We sat at an area where you could see the kitchen, and the chefs asked us how we were enjoying everything, which was really neat :) All in all, it was really good."}
{"text":"Such a great night! 

First of all, we were so late. SO late. I hate myself for it, but sometimes it inadvertently happens. I called in ahead and they were totally accommodating, despite my blunders. 

We ordered the bulgogi beef tartare to start and it was great. Salty and crisp and just plain delicious. For our mains we ordered all sorts of different things: the Muskovy duck, the station burger, two of the brown trouts, and the butter poached halibut. All liked their food. Order the burger if you prefer more savoury things and the duck if you like a little sweetness in your mains. 

For dessert, we ordered the Japanese cheesecake. It was underwhelming, order another dessert! 

What made the restaurant a five star in my books was not the food, unfortunately. It was the people! Nancy was our server and she was so kind, she even let us meet the chef which was such a treat. The salted fudge at the end was also a nice touch. 

Whatever the case, you MUST visit Richmond Station and see for yourself. 

TIP: They can change starter sizes! We came with five people, but the beef tartare is made for four. Thankfully, they offered to make adjustments--crisis averted.  

TIP for the gals: the bathroom has a bit of a step on the way out. I WARNED YA!"}
{"text":"The apps and entrees are pretty average very innovative ideas but not so good execution. The desserts on the other hand are mind blowing. Save room and et two desserts per person."}
{"text":"Richmond Station is one of the best restaurants in Toronto. I recently met a friend here for dinner, and here is what I found...

1. The food is delicious. They blend common ingredients in creative ways. For example, I had scallops (26$) that were served with cauliflower, Israeli couscous and lime. Everything worked together brilliantly. I got the sense that it was something I could not do at home AND was not so out there that most people could not really enjoy.
2. The service is very good. I thought my server did an excellent job.
3. The place is versatile. You could come here for a nicer casual lunch with friends or a formal business dinner with equal ease. It is dressy without too much formality. It is both loud, yet strangely intimate at the same time. (It was crowded, yet still easy to hear!)
4. The movie snacks dessert is a work of pure genius. While it could have been larger, hats off to the popcorn ice cream and pop flavoured wafers.
5. The overall experience was great. This is easily one of the best places for a delicious meal in Toronto."}
{"text":"Attentive service, a great atmosphere and they know their dishes inside and out! Our whole party liked our individual choices and we were taken care of really well throughout the night. It is on the pricier side of Toronto establishments, but it's understandable considering the the level of care, quality of ingredients and attention to detail applied to every aspect of the night. Will be back, especially when needing a place to make a great impression!"}
{"text":"Took my daughters to Toronto for a dad & daughters weekend (ok, we called it a Girls Weekend..).  They are 25 & 30.

Travel to Toronto monthly for business and they asked to go to my favorites.  Richmond Station is my \"goto\" place for great food and great service.  So we went there on the 28th for dinner.

It was Earth Hour when we walked in and the lights were almost off and lots of candles. We were welcomed in Station fashion.  The manager remembered my request for a reservation to show my daughters my favorite hangout and she welcome us and made them feel comfortable.  We shared a drink at the long tables (holding spots while the table is being readied).  We were seated and had a table next to the open kitchen.  

We had a glass of wine and they were enthralled with the crowd and action in the kitchen.  One of my daughters asked about ingredients in an appetizer and the server realized it was a food allergy.  She was very attentive to any requests ato the point of having the duck scallion pancakes made but without the pancake (dairy) and used lettuce.

The meals were great.  One fish, one lamb ad one burger.

To me, the food is always awesome, but the service continues to exceed my expectations.  thanks for a memorable nite."}
{"text":"Cool hip atmosphere, great food and drinks, well-priced. Polenta fries were a hit!"}
{"text":"I had a dinner here last night and it was awesome.  Our server was very nice and he took the time to explain the meals.  I think the chefs here are fun to watch (we had a seat view of the kitchen) and it seemed like they all had a fun time preparing the meals.  Overall, great restaurant and I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came here with fellow Yelper, Shivani G., as one of my many farewell dinners. She chose the place because she has this secret (well, not so secret) crush on Carl Heinrich.

Ambiance is great. A little loud -- however, I hear there's an upstairs as well where you can look into the kitchen. I wish we had a seat there!

Anyhow, both Shivani and I started off with a bit of wine, and the AMAZING chacuterie plate. Everything was just so delectable and amazing. I can't even explain how delicious this was. TOTALLY recommending this.

We both ordered something from special's menu, so I can't really recall what we had. I THINK she had the chicken (or I could be totally wrong), and I had the steak. The steak came with these amazing potatoes; however, the butter hollandaise sauce on it was a little too much for me. It was way too buttery.

DESSERT! Oh dear. This was AMAZING. I can't recall what it was called, but it had both lemon and blueberries. It was a lemon custard with meringue. You can't go wrong with that. It was to die for.

A little bit on the heftier side with how much you have to pay - but you really can't complain with Carl Heinrich's cooking. I mean, he WAS Top Chef Canada, right?"}
{"text":"Went their for my husband's birthday dinner. We we got there we got a table near their bar and it was very loud. So we requested our server to give us another table if possible and she did fulfill our request. We got a table near the kitchen and this area is more comfortable for the seating.

We ordered started with Polenta fries and ordered Stn. Burger, Heritage Pork for the mains. Polenta fries were the best I've ever had. Stn Burger is the real deal. The beef patty was cooked to perfection and was amazingly flavourful and juicy for that matter even the bun was too goooood. The burger was too good that I forgot to eat fries and I am telling you I am a huge fries fan. My husband ordered Heritage Pork and that was delicious too. 

Finally we decided to have London Fog and it was to die for!! I would give up anything to have it again and again. Though every dish here was phenomenal but for me \"LONDON FOG\" was the \"Dish of the Day\""}
{"text":"Just go straight to the burger . You won't be disappointed. I enjoyed this place because the food was amazing and it gave a very low key vibe with high quality taste. Their assortments of drinks are great, I was tempted to try all of them as they all looked so great but only had a chance to try the milk martini ( which was amazing)."}
{"text":"I came here for a dinner with my girlfriends.  The ambience isn't spectacular and if you get seated near the kitchen you feel like you're going to leave smelling of food (you probably won't) but the service is impeccable and the food is very tasty.  We split a few things and ordered the duck liver pate, polenta fries, small roasted carrot salad, small brassica caesar salad and the small Chioggia beet salad.  I can honestly say that the food was delicious and quite filling.  The duck liver pate would have disappeared immediately if we didn't take the time to savour every delectable bite.  The polenta fries were a great twist on regular fries, with just enough of a tomato sauce accompaniment so that they stayed crisp, and ensured that you didn't ruin the flavour by over-dipping.  I couldn't get enough of the roasted carrot salad: spicy and sweet, nutty with a bit of a balanced acidity.  So good.  The brassica caesar was a very different take on the classic Caesar salad; served as more of a slaw, with actual pieces of anchovies and more on the tangy than creamy side.  I'm not sure if I can decide between this salad and the roasted carrot salad as my favourite because both were truly delicious.   My least favourite was the Chioggia beet salad.  I think it would have been better served with a goat cheese than labneh, but I suppose that would be less innovative.  It was still a very good salad but the beets were quite sweet (as is the Chioggia beet nature), which I personally would have preferred balanced out with some acidity.  My friends felt similarly.
Overall this place was very good and I look forward to going back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"This was a great experience.  They were so pleasant and fun.  The food was awesome.  We had the tasting menu and got a little of everything.  They accommodated our food preferences and made great wine suggestions.  The chef even came over and spoke to us for a bit.  The rib steak was unbelievable.   Best dining experience in Toronto in a long time."}
{"text":"Read the fab reviews of this place and had to make a visit when I got to the city. Perhaps a little overrated? 

The polenta fries were delish. I highly recommend. The fried chicken (special on the menu) was so-so. Could have been crispy. It was soggy by the time it got to the table. 

As for the mains we had a grilled swordfish which was cooked very well. But the veggies beneath it felt like it did not go well with the fish. It almost overpowered the taste of the white fish. 

We had the beef trio or duo. It was overcooked. 

Otherwise, the place was unpretentious and great for catch up with friends on a Friday night."}
{"text":"My boyfriend's family and I came here for a goodbye lunch before they went home after their trip visiting us. We were pressed for time and the waitstaff and kitchen were very accommodating.

I ordered:
Duck Confit Lettuce Wraps
Eggplant Parmesan Sandwich

The lettuce wraps were a great appetizer, not too heavy and they had an interesting flavor. The Eggplant Parm sandwich was really delicious. It was an open faced sandwich with a Ceasar salad on the side. The salad was not your typical Ceaser and had a great mix of lettuce and kale, with a really tasty creamy dressing.

Really nice place, I would come back for a special occasion"}
{"text":"Several colleagues told me that I'd have the \"best burger in Toronto\" here. And, truth be told, it's quite delicious! But, I don't think it's necessarily *the* best. Still, the food was pretty good, and we enjoyed our evening here. We visited on a weekday evening and it was incredibly busy - located right by Yonge & Richmond/the Eaton Centre, you'd be smart to make reservations ahead of time - it's a popular spot to visit after work for those in the Financial District as well.. 

Richmond Station finds the perfect balance between casual and swanky. It's upscale, but you can still roll in wearing jeans. Ambiance is chill but with a hint of sophistication. We all ordered the famous Richmond Station Burger + Fries. I requested my beef burger to be made medium, and it was made very well - thick but tender, juicy, no sense of toughness. The fries were alright - a little limp, and not very crispy. For the combo, I paid almost $30 with tip.

A good experience with food that's quite delicious. But keep in mind - you're also paying for the location, popularity, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"From the cool vibe of the dining room to the attention to detail in every plate Richmond Station will win the attention of your heart and taste buds at the same time. The ingredients are fresh and delicious, the food plating and the game of flavors and textures is really creative. The \"Duck Two Ways\" was outstanding and the baklava available today was an out-of-this-world recreation of a more banal middle eastern dessert. Great service as well, with close attention to any food allergies and to the flow of the meal."}
{"text":"Review of the burger at richmond station

Burger is amazing.  It's ground beef around some other beef. Medium rare is best!  Call it beefception.
Fries are crispy and dope
Aoli is amazing

Cons:
Price is steep for a burger / fries.

Overall review 4.5 but giving it a 5 star."}
{"text":"The Station has to be one of the best dining experiences in Canada. I have eaten here 20+ times as everything from a single to groups of more than 20 and it never disappoints.

The service is friendly and they make you feel a part of the family. Love the always changing menu options and the consistent winners (best burger ever).

Chef Carl is the man and has made Richmond Station one of our favorite spots."}
{"text":"This is my first time visit the restaurant, I will say it is decent. The food is good. The service is a little bit inadequate, the main server seems to be very busy, fortunately the helpers are very friendly."}
{"text":"From start to finish my experience at Richmond Station was exceptional. 

Upon walking into the restaurant, Richmond Station doesn't look that big, but then you'll notice the large back room behind the main room, as well as a small, more private room that is designed so it looks like you're eating in someone's private pantry (complete with a fridge of pickled veggies, shelves full with Nutella, baking powder, etc.) I ADORED this cute little room. It sat 8 of us quite comfortably, and made it more of an intimate experience, as well as a bit quieter (when stepping out into the main area on our way out we really noticed the difference.)

When it comes to dining, if you ask ahead of time a tasting menu can be prepared. The cost of this varied (generally $50-65ish), but our lovely wait staff informed us it can be tailored so you can keep the courses coming, so long as everyone still wants to eat! 

We all opted for the traditional menu, this time around. All the food that came out to our table was beautifully presented - you can tell a lot of time and thought has gone into the plating. The food was simply fantastic. I tried everything on the charcuterie board and it is one of my favorite charcuteries I've had the pleasure of trying. Nice variety, fresh food, and fantastic flavours that all complement each other. 

If you're looking for a light appetizer, try the Pecorino Fresco. Mmmm. This is a soft, milder cheese, but the flavor is still delicious. Served with some toasted crostini I happily snacked on this while chatting with my dining companions, awaiting our mains.

For my main I opted for the Pierogies. Ooooohmygod. These are heaven in pierogie form. Easily my favourite pierogies that I've had anywhere, ever. The flavor from the ramp in the pierogies is really fantastic, and the plate itself is just beautiful. Smears of beet puree give the plate colour, with dots of sour cream scattered about the plate. When you mix in the beet-horseradish puree, with the piergoies, and the swiss chard, it is a pierogie flavor explosion in your mouth. Yummmm. 

I tried one of the desserts on special, as well as the creamsicle dessert, and while they were pretty, I felt that I was underwhelmed with them compared to the rest of the meal. Don't get me wrong, they were good, but I felt like not quite on the same level as the apps and mains around the table.

Overall a fantastic experience and a solid 4.5/5 - I can't wait to come back for the tasting menu (and I know the allure of those delicious pierogies won't keep me away for long...)"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that this could have been a good meal, it unfortunately was not.

I was taken here as part of my bachelor. There seemed to be some hype about this place although I never heard of it, given all the other restaurants in the area, I just never came across this place. It's located right in the core of downtown, but is pretty unassuming compared to other downtown restaurants.

Unfortunately, the service just absolutely ruined my dinner, and I will always remember this place as the subpar restaurant for my bachelor. Upon entering the restaurant we were not acknowledged, I assume due to the mess of bodies in the front. The space that we were seated at barely fit us without bumping elbows. If you have a large party I recommend you look elsewhere if you're expecting personal space to eat. As the food came out, the service was very spotty, sometimes the servers would describe the dish, other times they put things down and ran for example. Servers would reach over my shoulder without warning that they were leaning in. If this were a restaurant in China town then fair enough but not at this price point. Quite a few times in the evening I would suddenly have this large wooden platter floating above me, or random hands reaching past my head. 

These were just a few of the misgivings, though there was one thing that really just jaded my experience. My friends had informed the server that they were looking for dares for me, given it's a bachelor. The server said she would go ask for some ideas, which 99% of the servers would usually fluff off silly requests or leave it to the end. This one did not. They came back with a list of dares - which is fine, they played along and earned a tip. One of the dares though was to eat a hot pepper, and unfortunately the server brought one out the size of my palm (found out it was a scotch bonnet) with the list. This was right at the beginning of the meal. I'm sure a restaurant like this would have handled other large gatherings, so I would expect that they would have experience diffusing silly situations. While it is partially the fault of my party for goading me, and also my fault for ultimately giving in and eating the pepper, it is also the restaurants fault for enabling this situation to happen. My meal for the rest of the evening was ruined. There are many factors on rating a restaurant; the most common are food, ambiance, and service. Ambiance and service wise, as noted was pretty spotty up to this point, and now the last saving grace, the food, was gone. 

I understand the server wanted to play along. Its fine, they had a request, and they can choose to dismiss it or not. There were lots of ways to handle this situation, including acknowledging the request AFTER the meal. If they provided the list of dares, and the hot pepper at the END of the meal - then this review could have said \"hey the decor and service was meh, but the food was great!\" The server would have done their part while also ensuring that the patron's meal is unaffected. But to do this right at the beginning of the meal, especially with something that can affect the taste of the food for the rest of the night is just not smart. Everything tasted like HOT burning and all I did was drink water and milk. I am quite saddend that a restaurant like this would enable (key word here) and fuel this situation. I was not warned that this hot pepper is 12 to 140 times hotter than a jalapeno - not your average hot pepper. No disclaimer or anything. This one just handed it over.

The presentation of the food looked decent but I will never know how things tasted as my meal was ruined. Again, while I do not place the entire blame on the restaurant I do place some blame on them. If they did not ENABLE the situation by giving the hot pepper and the idea then none of this would have happened. This restaurant gave the idea AND the tools to ruin my meal.

My meal was ruined, money thrown out the window. This restaurant could have served me McDonalds and it would have all tasted the same. I will never know if the food tasted good, and I will always remember this restaurant as the place where everything tasted like hot from my bachelor.  If this place was actually a McDonalds and the food/service/ambiance was bad that's fine as you get what you pay for. But at this price point ($21 for just a burger), I really had much much higher expectations and it hurt the wallet to have everything just taste hot. If you're in any sort of a rowdy group - do not go to this restaurant - If your friends dare you to five finger roulette, this restaurant would probably hand over the knife. I have no clue why the server would think this was a good idea at all. As the person celebrating, my meal was ruined. This was for a bachelor party in the summer of 2016.

Epic fail and disappointment. 

Despite all the good reviews on here, sorry Richmond Station but you let this one slip. I had much higher expectations, but you missed them"}
{"text":"This place is the highlight of our trip.  Service was great and Lunch was so good we are coming back for dinner.  My husband had the white bean soup Which was really really good.  Then we shared the apple and blue cheese salad.  Amazing. Perfect blend of textures, favors and their homemade ranch had us licking the last drop off our plate.  Then came the burger.  It was the best burger I've had in a while.  Just a little tip-don't share the burger with anyone.  It's too good to share.  You want your own, trust me."}
{"text":"Excellent service and interesting, dynamic dishes. I ordered 2 specials, the Strawberry & Pecorino Salad and Euro Bass. Both were well balanced with a nice combination of flavors and textures. My only criticism is that both dishes could have used a hint more citrus/acid, but they were both still delightful. I wish I had had room for dessert. They have local beer on tap; the brown ale was tasty. All in all, a great farm-to-table style restaurant."}
{"text":"Their charcuterie board and cheese selection is good. We got the duck and sea bass. The sea bass is average, except the sauce is a bit too salty. The duck looked like duck steak. The outter layer of the steak along the skin is tender and zesty. It seems to loose a bit of the flavour on the inside. The server is great! The food quality is great, maybe just not directed towards our taste buds. Price is high."}
{"text":"Excellent meal.  Portions were smaller but I had two of their specials (smoked tomatoe salad and a beef entree) and both were excellent! Travelling alone on business and was able to get a seat at the bar and the service at the bar was superb.  I will be back and highly recommend this smaller but very neat establishment."}
{"text":"It's all true. This food is awesome and the ambiance is good...just not that intimate.

I often wonder if a restaurant legitimately earns its stripes as the Best Restaurant in Toronto as deemed so by TripAdvisor, or through some scheme to get more \"excellent\" reviews. However its clear to see why there are so many great reviews for Richmond Station.

Being in the downtown core at Yonge and Richmond, I expected a more formal business crowd however the restaurant that day was filled with an eclectic mix of styles, ages, genders and groups. The restaurant has two seating levels with a main and upper floor and a large community table on the main floor.

If you're looking for an intimate dinner for two, I would suggest there are other places that will allow you to sit closer to your mate and with some distance between other guests. However when you're as popular as Richmond Station, the more seating the better (for the restaurant). So I get why the layout is as it is. They also have a kitchen bar where singles can sit and watch their food being prepared. This is a nice area but the view of the kitchen and the kitchen itself are not that spectacular.

The service is one of the great things about Richmond Station. The wait staff is friendly and they use traditional small notebooks (and not iPads). I also like the fact that our waiter, Steve was forthright with his recommendations with both the great and the not so great.

The food itself is representative of the world class chef Carl Heinrich is. The ingredients are simple and fresh, the preparation is logical and the resulting flavours are wonderful. The Chickpea Fritters were awesome and the rest of our meal, also as great.

I think this is one of the best restaurants for a lunch or dinner with friends or business associates. The community table on the main floor which holds about 24 people would also being a wonderful time for a large group."}
{"text":"I tried Richmond Station's lunch tasting menu, and was entirely blown away. Do not mistaken: it is an expensive meal. But, I would definitely say that their tasting menu is worth trying at least once. I had around eight courses (I lost count; see pictures for details). It was a fun experience, the food was outstanding, and the service was nice. Highly recommend the tasting menus here!"}
{"text":"2 years on and still going strong with quality seasonal dishes in combinations that you've never dreamed to try. This is top top top unpretentious cooking at its best."}
{"text":"WOW, wonderful, amazing are the words that you need to describe this place.  The food here is near perfect.  On my last visit, I opted for the tasting menu.  It was 7 courses of pure culinary bliss.  The chef here is a master in his craft.  The highlights were the charcuterie plate, a whole fish followed by a venison roast that was out of this world.  The deserts are wonderful as well.  A must while in Toronto."}
{"text":"You'd never guess this was Toronto's 'must-try' new culinary gem. An uninspired room in the midst of Downtown, Richmond Station excels at being harmless, unfussy, and hardly anything worth buzzing about. 

The bar feels like afterthought; shoved into a corner with a coffee-maker. The drink here is beer, but a narrow selection from Muskoka didn't rev me up. The wine list is heavy on the BC wines, though I felt like at $16-20 a glass they were overvaluing the 'Canadianness' of the grapes. Selling Canada--from potatoes, mussels, oyster, wines--felt like the menu's whole approach--and while I love this great nation, the chefs at Richmond Station may have lost sight of how to connect their BC wines to an
Albertan steak. 

The dish that moving fastest was, unequivocally, the beef tartare, a mustardy chop meat pile with crispy onions tossed in seasoned salt. It was fun for a bit or two, but the whole thing just seemed clumsy, heavy-handed, and boring. And at $14 for a tiny portion, I was hardly satisfied.

Service is giddy but distant. Everyone's very excited about the success of Richmond Station and the servers are solid brand/meal ambassadors, but fall flat on actually serving. I waited a good while for a bottle of water, although they had plenty on display--and had to eye someone else's bread before my waitress remembered to bring some for me.

Downtown Toronto is not teeming with dinner options--Richmond Station will likely cater to the after-work Bay Streeters--but for anyone else, Richmond Station isn't worth hacking downtown traffic for."}
{"text":"Loved it. Apps to share special of empenadas with pastrami and saur kraut was so good!  Kitchen is excellent and servers friendly attentive and helpful.  Will be going back."}
{"text":"What a fantastic evening. I have never left a restaurant and immediately written a rave review. We were lucky enough to be seated at the chefs table, and decided to get the tasting menu. It was fabulous. 8 courses total, each one more delicious than the next. A lot of food, but well worth it. You get to sit very close to the kitchen and watch the magic happen. The cauliflower agnolotti is not something I would typically order but it was fantastic. Same with the trout. We had excellent service, and one of the chefs came and chatted with us after which was very nice. I highly recommend the tasting menu, you get a lot of food for a reasonable price. Try to book the chefs table too, it's awesome!"}
{"text":"Things in Toronto don't always live up to the hype, but this did. We started the meal with an old fashioned and their vodka, elderflower, citrus drink (who's name escapes me). Like any $16 cocktail, the drinks were strong, and tasty and we got to watch the bartender make them. 

Service was super friendly, and brought us homemade sour dough slices that that days soybean oil and balsamic mix. We both ordered burgers, with toppings removed or on the side, and they were very accommodating and remembered to actually put it all on the side. The burger seems small at a first glance, but it is a thick patty cooked to a perfect medium rare. The beet relish compliments it perfectly, and the but is soft and warm. The fries are nice and crispy too!

For dessert was ordered the peach mousse? It was cool conceptually, but did not deliver on the taste front. A fun experiment in gastronomy, but not meant to be eaten...just admired and marvelled for the \"fun with food\" aspect. 

It's definitely in the runner for (if not the actual) best burger in the city, but the price tag definitely isn't the best in the city."}
{"text":"I made reservations for party of 6 at 11:45 but due to unforeseen circumstances i needed it to be pushed back 30 mins and they were nice enough to accommodate. When I arrived I notice how small the restaurant is. It's not meant for large parties. Also they kept reminding me we only had. 1.5 hour seating time. The atmosphere was a bit louder then I expected. Also a bit more casual then I was expecting also.

We ordered all the appetizers to share. My favourite was the frites and the duck liver. The liver tasted sweet and didn't have the normal weird taste to it. As for the veggie dip.. it was a waste of money.

I ordered the burger as a lot of reviews on Yelp has recommended it. I was debating this or the rabbit. My coworker ordered the rabbit and it looked delicious but the burger wasn't bad. Cooked medium rare. The fries were good too. 

As for dessert I got the black sesame ice cream with some weird stuff. I was hoping it'll taste good. Let's just say it was interesting but wouldn't order again. 

Over all service was good but slow. We had a view of the open kitchen. The servers were attentive but I don't like how they kept reminding me my seating limit of 1.5 hours. With the 6 of us, we spend a good amount of $$ on the food. I think with their slow service and our business we should be able to sit longer."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service.

Our server realized a napkin had fallen to the ground a brought out a fresh one before we had noticed.

We had the following:
Beef bulgogi tartare
Scallop crudo
Burger
Leek pierogi
Acid test

All of it was wonderful. Best pierogi I have ever had. The acid test was both delicious and whimsical."}
{"text":"Amazing and flavourful food is how I would describe this place!

This restaurant was recommended to me by a couple of people and initially I walked right by it because it was not very noticeable. Once I walked in, I recognized the owner of the restaurant, who was the winner of Top Chef Canada of season 2. Anyway, hostess was friendly and the restaurant was somewhat narrow and crowded, but it provided a cozy feel to the atmosphere.

My colleague and I were seated in front of the kitchen window, which was pretty exciting because we got to watch the chefs cook and prepare the meals.

We ordered two appetizers and two mains to share. We ordered the duck liver pate and quinoa salad (large), and the slow-cooked rainbow trout and braised beef ravioli. Everything was very tasty, with a good amount of seasoning and acidity. After our meal, my colleague ordered a coffee, and I ordered the chocolate mousse for dessert and it was delicious; however, I think the portions could be bigger! The plating was beautifully presented. They also had specials but we didn't realize that there were specials until after we ordered and our waiter had not informed us of them unfortunately. 

I would definitely come back here to try other dishes. I heard that their menu changes every so often, so that is good to hear as it keeps customers coming back to try new things.

Pricing was decent for the quality of food served and the location (Yonge & Richmond). We spent approximately $60 per person including taxes and gratuity.  I think I could safely say that this is probably one of my favourite restaurants in the city thus far.

Tip: Be sure to make reservations early as it gets quite crowded on the weekends for dinner. We went on a Saturday at 5:30pm and reservations were made 3-4 days prior.  We were told that they only had kitchen window seating available at the time!"}
{"text":"After shopping at Easton Center, I took my gf down to this restaurant. This is one of my favorite place in Toronto. It was my 3rd time here. My gf also said the food were delicious, and she also like the decorations in the restaurant.

Their price is right, and the service is always amazing. The best part is that the restaurant is casual setting, so which means I don't have to dress up for dinner. Their food quality always the same, it won't be good one time and off the other times."}
{"text":"How could I give this place anything but 5 stars? We had one of the best meals in recent memory here, for sure. We ordered a lot of food, so here goes.

For starters, we grabbed a dozen oysters, which came with 3 different sauces. The vinegar was the best, although the chili oil was also tasty. We all shared a massive charcuterie tray with 9 meats and 3 cheeses. All meats are actually cut and prepared 100% onsite, and every single one was delicious. A venison sausage was one standout, but all were impeccable. Cheeses were great, but didn't blow my mind. A ginger carrot slaw that came as an accoutrement did, though. Wow.

We also split two appetizer salads - one was a roast carrot with a yoghurt dressing, the other a broccoli with these little spicy fried cauliflowers. Oh, those cauliflowers. Do not miss both of these salads. You will waste away in eternal regret if you do. The gods of \"good food you should have tried\" will visit misery upon you. Consider yourself cursed.

Main dishes - 3 of us all got the pork done 3 ways. Our server recommended this. And he was spot on. It was a lovely variety - one braised, one ground and rolled in a thin pasta dough then seared, and one lightly fried with a cheese in a croquette. A light slaw came with it. Blew our minds. One of our party got the sweet potato pasta, which looked awesome but we didn't try it. He didn't share.

Finally we ordered dessert. We got the rice cheesecake, which was really interesting. The killer was a dish not yet on the attached menu though (being added shortly). It was a rye and rhubarb *something* with white chocolate. Order it. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Phenomenal meal. Should have made reservations-they were very busy-but they were super accommodating. Trout hush puppies with curry ketchup, perogies, polenta fries, salad, everything was delicious. Even had dessert-squid ink ice cream with sake infused cherry purée. HAD to try it. Crazy! And actually good!"}
{"text":"Let's start by saying that they have really good selection of vino! I tried their burger (amazing) and the scallion polenta fries (not impressed aka don't bother ordering them) and for dessert I had their cheesecake (which is out of this world !!! I can't even tel you how good it was.... even if you are full please do yourself a favor and try IT!"}
{"text":"Returned after a very nice visit last year. Another wonderful dining experience. Had the duck pate and lamb croquette apps - both were quite tasty. I had the quail, which came de-boned: very unusual, and a welcome change. The co -  diners both ordered the rainbow trout. They described it as \"beautifully cooked.\"  Also enjoyed 2 local draft beers. Service was, as before, beyond expectations. We were recognized, and our server took us on a tour of the kitchen: an excellent \"welcome back\" gesture. We may just have a tradition for future visits to Toronto, one that includes Richmond Station."}
{"text":"atmosphere was nice; simple yet refined.  food was delicious, the platters the food was served on were rustic beauty, the people who served the food were really genuinely friendly, the folks in the kitchen were pleasant and generous and seemed to really be enjoying themselves (we sat at the chef's table), the owner came by to check if we were having a good time... the desserts were visually stunning and very complex yet comforting.  i was like, man, they have their stuff tight. really a memorable dining experience"}
{"text":"Thoroughly impressed with this place - food, service and ambience are all on point! What more can we ask for? (They give out this amazing sourdough bread as a starter too.) 

We ordered Mussels Escabeche ($11) which comes with 5 mussels on top of potatoes with aioli. You can add an additional mussel for $2.50. This was delicious and a perfect bite size snack to share! 

For main, I got one of their specials which was a seared scallops ($27). There was a generous amount of perfectly seated scallops, plated with greens. I wish I paid more attention (or have better memory) to the small print or the server explaining the dish... but the SAUCE was so AMAZING. It was an impressing combination and I'm so so IN LOVE with this dish. 

Lastly, we got their special dessert ($10) which included black sesame sponge, lychee, milk tea ganache, nori and toasted rice ice-cream. SO DELICIOUS! Everything worked so well together, first time trying toasted rice ice-cream and it won't be my last...

Moreover, the service was great since the waiter always made sure we were enjoying ourselves and refilling our water. All in all, would I come back? Yes, most definitely!"}
{"text":"Tried the tasting menu with a friend and also ordered off the menu. Everything was almost comically awful. Rabbit pâté en croûte was so tough and the brioche tasted like plastic. The courses were ambitious in idea/ingredients/presentation but generally just..tasted bad. Even the oyster starter was off and the charcuterie board had very bland meat (how do you screw this up?) The main for the tasting menu was a strange pierogi with sweet pink sauces. Only good course was the 'Duck 3 Ways' ordered a la carte off the menu. Even then, I think it was only average but a relief after being presented with so many bad courses. Service was pretty good and the atmosphere was buzzy and casual. Overall, it was a horrifyingly disappointing culinary experience. I've never paid so much for such bad food. It's bizarre to me that this place is consistently rated as one of the best restaurants in Toronto. Huge distrust of general palate of this city when it comes to fine dining."}
{"text":"Awesome service from the moment I walked in. Teddy the bartender was a rock star very friendly and helpful with the menu. Cod Cakes were perfect and the Brussels salad was incredible. The excellent reviews of this place is spot on. Small but charming."}
{"text":"Ordered the a la carte pasta and the soup du jour  - both were really good. I have been here before and tried the burger - highly recommended...

I'll be returning to this place soon."}
{"text":"I have been here for weekday lunch (they have a 2 course prix fixe special), dinner, and most recently, for Saturday slow roast. Flavour and quality are consistently excellent, the service is always warm and friendly, and the space is great. Bonus points for being a reliable option in an area that is dominated by overpriced touristy places. 

This is not a place to go for #meatlessmondays... The meat dishes are where they shine and they source meat from small, local farmers and only buy whole animals to cut down on waste. The charcuterie boards and the burger are always a hit and the slow roast Saturday lunch is fantastic. The dish changes every week -- when I went it was $22 for roasted chicken on cauliflower puree with potatoes and vegetables on the side. A hearty and delicious lunch! If you add dessert it is only $6 (instead of the regular price of $11). Be warned, the slow roast is available til 4pm or when it sells out. Try to come early. When I went, they ran out around 1:30pm. If you want something lighter, they do have some soups and a quinoa salad, as well as a daily fish dish. 

There's a small room at the back that can accommodate private groups and they can do a chef's menu for your group. I haven't tried that yet. 

They have a decent wine list and some fun cocktails on offer. If you sit at the back, you can watch the kitchen action, or if you're here for a business lunch there are tables and bar seating in the brighter front area. 

Gotta love the vintage TTC etiquette posters in the bathroom too."}
{"text":"Arguably one of the BEST restaurants in Toronto. Not sure who in their right mind would ever rate this place less than a 5/5. It's in my top 5 restaurants I've dined in I believe, the knowledgeable, 'cool' staff and unique cocktail/ menu items are sure to please ANY foodie.
Started with the trout tartare, duck pate, and oysters for apps. Our fantastic server Kevin suggested the fish special (rockfish) with pickled fennel and gnocci(?) -delicious!!! The cocktails were phenomenal, classics with a twist eg. Walnut/basil in an old fashion. It all added to full experience and I throughly enjoyed it all!"}
{"text":"This place is like a gourmet diner. All comfort food made deliciously. Great service and ambiance. We ordered many dishes, but the highlights were definitely the station burger (quite possibly the best burger in the city), the agnolotti, and of course the polenta fries!! Unfortunately, we did not have room for dessert so I guess we will have to come back!"}
{"text":"I had the best dinner in a long time at Richmond Station! It's rare that I love everything - from appetizer to dessert! The staff were nice. Prices were reasonable for the quality you are getting. There's public parking right beside the restaurant. I will most definitely be coming back again!! I couldn't stop talking about the meal after we were done!

We ordered the crispy pork belly with a slightly spicy apple, cucumber, scallion salad as an appetizer. Best pork belly, perfectly cooked. Appetizer portions are small, and more meant for one person instead of sharing. For mains, we ordered the slow cooked smoked trout, it comes medium rare and was so so smoked and buttery good. We also ordered the crispy duck confit, which is a crispy duck leg, and comes with pan fried gnocchi, mushrooms and broccoli. The pan fried gnocchi and mushroom sauce were so good, I would totally order it on its own. For dessert, we ordered the ice cream bar which is their most popular, and the bubble tea. Each dessert plate is packed with different flavours! The ice cream bar was spectacular, it said it had pecans and I was expecting an ice cream bar with individual pecans in it but they actually crushed the pecans and sort of made it into a cookie/ biscuit layer within the ice cream, so the texture was great! The bubble tea had milk tea ganache, lychee sorbet, and tapioca pudding and some matcha powder to top it off, it's like I am eating 3 desserts at the same time and are all good!!

All in all, it was a five star meal and explained why it is quite hard to get reservations at this restaurant!! Book a few weeks in advance if you want dinner on the weekend!"}
{"text":"I had the Eurobass and I have to say it was amazing. The chef did a good job of bringing together a bunch of flavors. I also had the cheesecake but wasn't a big fan of it because it was spicy. It was my fault for ordering it because the waiter did mention that it was spicy. The jerk Turkey wraps for appetizers were great too. I truly think this restaurant deserves a 5 out of 5. Great food for a good price. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Very good tasting menu at a good price. The chef's table was a fun experience. Probably one of the better tasting menus in Toronto actually (I've been to almost all of them)"}
{"text":"Got a last minute reservation here on a Friday night at 6:30pm, with the caveat that we would leave by 8:15pm. No problem - I was excited to try this Top Chef restaurant and delighted to be accommodated on such short notice.

In short - I am a fan. I thought the food was well executed and also reasonable priced.

What we had:
- Lobster Cocktail appetizer - delish! The lobster pieces were generous and prepared well. The tempura is not anything different or notable, but it was well done and how can you go wrong with lobster? 
- Digby Scallops - this came with 3 large juicy scallops well cooked and enjoyable.
- Special of the day - Beef Duo of striploin and sirloin. While the meat is not of the quality of a steakhouse, it was very well cooked. It came with pommes kennedy which were delicious
- Almond Joy dessert - this was a special that consisted of layers of chocolate and coconut with some nuts. I loved it.
- Cracker Jack dessert - I can't remember exactly what was in this, but I did enjoy the unique flavours of popcorn ice cream and peanut brittle pieces.

The service was very good and the waiter seemed knowledgeable and answered all our questions well. The restaurant itself is not fancy but decorated like an upscale train station. It was very comfortable. I spied a private room that looked nice that I wouldn't mind booking for a party at some point.

I would definitely come again and it's a solid option for dinner and lunch in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here many times, and each time has been a pleasure. There's a ton of personality here - from the subway-inspired theme, to the service, and the food. 

There are two menus here - the chalkboard specials, and the standard menu. In either case, meat and fish are the stars here, and the Station Burger is one of the best restaurant-quality burgers in the city. 

The chalkboard specials are fun, but not as adventurous as I would usually hope. Even so, the special menus are an opportunity for chefs to experiment, and for that reason alone, I believe that it is worth considering. I would just hope for more risk-taking. 

There is a reason why Richmond Station is one of the better food destinations in the city. While, personally speaking, it is not my favourite restaurant, it is an experience that nearly all guests can appreciate - making it an excellent choice when eating with friends."}
{"text":"This was a very nice dinner experience with very good service with nice décor and ability to see the kitchen depending on where you are seated.  It is on the small side and thus was a bit loud on a crowded Saturday night however it did not detract from my experience much.  Food quality was top notch make sure to check the specials as my whole meal was ordered off the menu.  If I return to Toronto I would not miss the opportunity to visit again"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times, and I keep coming back to the tasting menu. What a great experience that it. Ten dishes, all beautifully plated and tasting like nothing else you've ever tried before. I think that's one of the things that sets RIchmond Station apart, is the flavours. I'm amazed when I try something delicious that I would never be able to recreate, and most of their dishes seem to do that.. 

Even though Richmond Station is cool in that way, it's way more approachable than most of the restaurants with super-pricey elitist cuisine. If the restaurant could talk, it would say, \"Hey, do you have a sec? I've just made something cool that I'd like you to try.\"

Get reservations though. The tasting menu takes a couple of hours at least, and even getting reservations a day or two before can be challenging. That being said, it's totally worth it :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food! We were a small party of 3 and tried each other's dishes. Every bite was interesting and unique. The staff clearly love working there and were very informed about the dishes and how they were prepared. We had a birthday girl who was a fan of the Top Chef show so it was extra exciting to get a tour of the kitchen. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"For me, Richmond Station completely lived up to the hype. I wasn't able to get a booking through the website, so I emailed them and was booked the next day. It was perhaps easy for them since I was a party of ONE that night. Oh, and if you're wanting to go, but don't know anyone in Toronto or just don't know anyone who wants to go, then GO SOLO. The woman sitting next to me was dining alone. The woman sitting behind me was dining alone. It was great. 

Anyway, I sat at the \"Chef's Table,\" which is really a bar area that overlooks the kitchen. It was very cool to watch the guys work (I think I picked up a few tips), and it wasn't hot. 

When I'm in a nice restaurant, I tend to get the duck as it's something I don't cook at home. I asked the lovely girl serving the bar area what she would recommend, and boy I had my eye on that duck. But she mentioned the burger specifically, as did about 1,000 other people in online reviews. How can I visit Richmond Station - probably the only time I will ever do so since I live in Colorado - and get a burger? Oh well, Stacy, bite the bullet - or, rather, the burger. I went with it, along with a carrot/goat cheese roulade to start. 

The roulade came out, and wow - was it visually impressive. Lucky for me, it tasted as good as it looked (I uploaded pics, so you can see what I'm talking about). Next was the burger, and it was just as good as everyone who has tried it already knows. One of the best burgers I've ever had in my life. Could I fit in dessert? Sure, but I'd have to send back about half of those fantastic fries. I sent them back and went with their special for that day, the Station Candy Bar. It, again, was amazing. At first glance, I thought it would be WAY too much food. But it was light (for a chocolate dessert) and so flavorful that it was gone from my plate before I knew it. Maybe that girl next to me stole some bites, because it's kind of embarrassing how fast I finished it. Probably her fault. 

Anyway, get your reservation (in advance, as they're very popular) and make your way over to Richmond Station. Even if you're going alone. It's 100% worth every penny!"}
{"text":"First time here.It was so busy we could only get a reservation for Dec 23 and 8:45 and the place was jumping. We got an excellent table in the front room which is a little quieter and moe open than the back room, though in the back you can see them cooking as the kitchen is open behind glass.

The wait staff was excellent and I ordered a bottle of their house sauvignon blanc wine which bears their name. It was my first time having Canadian wine and it was not only good but very reasonably priced. 

My date and I shared all the courses, starting with chick-pea fritters, turkey sliders on jicama, and a large beet salad before we switched to our main of scallops. They were super accommodating to my date's dietary restrictions, and service was prompt. Dessert was an amazing carrot cake with maple ice cream. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Really good food and the wait staff was great as well. The hostess was a little rude, but which hostess isn't all pretentious and all!"}
{"text":"We had the sea bream ceviche to start, the roast Saturday special (porchetta), the pan seared skate wing, and the lobster capellini, and the chocolate torte. All of the dishes were amazing! The stand out was definitely the skate wing and (surprisingly) the crispy potatoes that went with it! So good! But all of the dishes were unique and had great flavour. The portion sizes were sizable and the price wasn't that bad either ($105 with the tax for 3 mains, an appetizer, and a dessert). Would definitely come back again :)"}
{"text":"Went there with the family just before valentines day. Had a great meal. Tried the salumi board --- loved it. Tried the polenta fries. Pretty nice, but the dense texture can get a bit weary after a few fries. I ordered the sirloin special of the night. Executed really well. Sides were amazing. Wife ordered the boar ragu. It was good, but I wouldnt say it was exceptional. Tried two deserts: chocolate ice cream and carrot cake. Chocolate ice cream was good, but again, I wouldnt say exceptional. Loved the carrot cake. It was an interesting take on the carrot cake with crispy carrots on top and a salty icing with some nice caramelized almonds for the sweetness and crunch. 

I think I will be back to try some of the other interesting dishes on the menu :)"}
{"text":"Having been to Richmond Station twice, I can comfortably say this is one of my favourite restaurants in the dt core.
Server is extremely knowledgeable about the dishes.
DUCK LIVER PATE - The pate toasts are blissful bites. Rich, smooth and creamy with mild gamey notes on a piece of toasted brioche. The mini candied fruit taste like strawberry jelly and adds a beautiful sweetness to break the richness.
POLENTA FRIES - I didn't care too much for this dish. Polenta was fried very crispy and the polenta is smooth inside. The spicy marinara was limited and didn't offer much of a kick. I feel it was too \"boring\" when shared only between 2 people, we each got at least 3-4 bulky fries and it felt too much.
STN BURGER - This was GOOOOOD. Beef was cooked to a perfect mid rare. Patty was juicy with all the right things going for it: richness from the cheese, sweetness from the beet chutney and a fluffy milk bun to hold it all. Maybe not the best burger I've ever had, but definitely memorable. Fries were crisp and well seasoned too but the garlic aioli was bland.
DAILY SPECIAL MARINATED STEAK - Steak was very tender and cook was better than most steak houses. Garnishes all taste delicious and gave it good balance: mild heat from chipotle black beans, beautiful kale florets and a smooth lime crema. 
LONDON FOG DESSERT - This was one of those abstract desserts that are deconstructed. All the components are absolutely delicious...I have trouble noting what each was but it was one of the highlights of my night.
Overall, I am very happy with the quality of food at Richmond Station. What makes it even better is the prices. Dishes run small but the friendly prices let you order more. We paid prices comparable to a Moxies/Milestones, but you get contemporary food that was prepared with creativity and finesse."}
{"text":"I came here after being rejected at Pearl Diver (see review), was greeted warmly and immediately seated. The ambiance is simple, elegant and clean. The food was some of the best I had in Toronto. That said, I haven't had outstanding food in Toronto. It was good, not extraordinary, but tasty. 

My only gripe is that the portion sizes are a touch too small, especially for the prices. I had a house salad, skate wing entree and Nutella ice cream and cheesecake for dessert. The salad was a good size, but the entree and dessert were small. I was hungry within 3 hours despite paying $55 including tip for the food."}
{"text":"Excellent! Go at 5:30, when you can get a reservation, and get lots of small items and split a main.  Wonderful servers, all of them. The restaurant stayed busy from 6:30 onward - on a Tuesday, too.  Had smoked trout croquettes, special goat cheese appetizer and a special roast broccoli salad with pork belly (but the crispy good bacony kind, not the crummy fatty chewy kind), then split the burger.  Couldn't finish the fries, which were great, and the salted chocolate fudge at the end was a great bonus.  Can't wait to go back, and really the servers are lovely, kind, well informed and pleasant."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed it a lot, but there were some slight \"misses\". First let me say that the $21 price fixe (2 rotating selections for app and main) is a great business lunch option, and adding the dessert for another $5 is a no-brainier (assuming you don't need to work in the afternoon - I was able to walk off the calories with 4 hours of death-marching the city all afternoon). 

On my visit, I chose tomato soup to start, and jicama \"tacos\" filled with beef tongue. I'd had tongue before and wasn't a fan, but on this visit I really enjoyed it based on the preparation (which was more like fried bologna in texture), and the condiments, including some great slaw on the side. 

The soup though wasn't the creamy style I appreciate - more like Campbell's soup when you prepare it with water instead of milk. It looked nice, but compared to the enormous bowl of asparagus soup the guy next to me got for $8 off the regular menu, I had \"the regrets.\"

So while there are merits to ordering the $21 menu, if you aren't getting the subsidized dessert, I'd consider the regular menu, which you can see lots of pictures of here on yelp. The aforementioned \"guy next to me\" ordered the huge soup and scallop crude, and that seemed like a pretty good strategy. 

As for me, I WAS getting dessert, so I chose the \"Cracker Jack\" option (regularly $9, for a $5 supplement), which I loved, except for a \"malt liquor\" foam that tasted like grandpa's stale beer, and really clashed with the rest of the otherwise excellent dessert (I suggested switching from malt liquor to Guinness, but even omitting it entirely would be an improvement). 

Service was excellent: Seated at the bar, I overheard a lot of staff discussion about accommodating a young patron who ordered a grilled cheese, so I saw how seriously they take the satisfaction of patrons young and old alike, and I appreciate that.  Also, everything in my own order was clearly and completely explained - fantastic service. 

I started this review as 4-star, but really it's a \"must\" for anybody working downtown, and visitors too, so in spite of the malt foam and the lackluster soup (which isn't a regular menu item), I'm rounding up to a 5, and I intend to return next year."}
{"text":"My friend/colleague and I have just returned from this place.

The hostess graciously moved us to another table when I realized I was going to freeze everytime the door was opened...brrrrr.

I must say, the food is excellent. We lunch dined on: potato/leek soup (both), beef jus w/frites & jus for dipping (she) and venison chili (me). These were on the lunch special menu and we enjoyed them thoroughly. My portion size was a little bit on the small side, especially if I compare to her sandwich portion but it was delicious. The side salad was simple and fresh. I like that they placed 3 jalapeno slices to the side in case I wanted to spice things up. She, too, had hot mustard to the side for her beef sandwich.

Service was fairly decent, we didn't have to wait too long. I did notice that our server, however, didn't take much time to speak with us as he did with other patrons but he was still friendly, courteous and professional. A \"thank you ladies\" on our way out would have been appreciated but it was still a good dining experience.

Wanted to have dessert which was included in the special for an extra $5. However, it would have been nice to have been asked by our server if we wanted dessert/coffee/tea but that didn't happen so I just asked for the bill.

We used to dine there before when it was an Asian restaurant (Yulla) and they've made good use of the space but seating is a little tight when it gets busy.

I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's Day as my girlfriend and I were big fans of Top Chef Canada season 2, and were cheering for Carl for much of the way. We started off with the polenta fries, which seemed to be a popular choice among the other tables. I loved the presentation, and they were creamy in the middle and crispy on the outside. Part of me ordered them because I wanted to know how a good polenta fry should taste in case I decided to make them at home myself. The bar has definitely been set high. For our main we both got the Richmond Burger, just because I had been thinking about eating that burger for almost a month and a half. (Though the Venison dish beside me that was off the daily board looked amazing). The burger was definitely all I hoped it would be and lived up to expectations. If you are going to pay 20 dollars for a burger, this is the one. The fries that came with the burger were good, and I appreciated the pickled veg. What I did not expect was to be blown away by the dessert, as I didn't think of Carl as a master dessert maker. The chocolate threesome dessert we had is one of my favourites I've had and was just the right amount to share. The first member of the chocolate threesome was a white chocolate brulee with a raspberry icewine sorbet. The second, a chocolate flourless torte with salted caramel ice cream and raspberries, and a raspberry sauce. And lastly a peanut butter bar, which I believed had a peanut brittle as a base, a creamy filling of I believe peanut butter and mascarpone, and chocolate on top. It was also dusted with peanut dust, which didn't taste like anything but looked cool. The light texture of the flourless torte was out of this world and really impressed me. If you are looking for a nice meal to celebrate an occasion or are looking to impress a hot date... this would be a good place."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed with myself for spending $25 on what Richmond Station called lunch. I had their $22 Prix Price which gives a combination of app/main. 

The food isn't bad, in fact, I love the beet soup. But the portion is so ridiculously small! The 4 baked chicken wings are so small that I don't think the meat even got closed to 50mg in total. Maybe I'm just cheap. Definitely won't come back here for food.

Great ambiance, btw."}
{"text":"We our 3rd Wedding Anniversary with great food and excellent service. When we arrived we enjoyed complimentary champagne to toast. It was a nice touch. We tried the appetizers of the day being the lobster samosas and the duck lettuce wraps followed by the coq au vin and station burger. We shared the matcha bar for dessert:) I also continued to drink the station sparkler. Being a fan of Asian fusion I loved the duck lettuce wraps. The mix of flavours were a party in my mouth. I didn't try the lobster samosas, but my husband enjoyed it. I wasn't as impressed by the coq au vin but it was good; also my first time having it. I tried my husband's burger which was very flavourful. He loves burgers and says it's the best he's ever had. The matcha bar my second favourite part of my meal after the appetizer. The food is reasonably priced and delicious. Excellent service goes a long way too!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant, for those who are willing to have dinner in a quite bright (comparing to other restaurants) and clean place. Food is very delicious and if you will, you may be seated next to chiefs to see how your dish is getting ready. That's awesome, isn't it?. And it does not smell oily as in some restaurants, so that you don't have to be concerned about your \"post-smell\". 
I've got organic chicken, and my vegan friend went with quinoa salad. Not a very good place for vegans though..
Decent prices, high quality products, great lobbies. Liked it! :)"}
{"text":"4.5/5! 

*Overall a phenomenal meal at Richmond Station. The restaurant have more of a casual and laid back feel, and despite arriving near the closing time, the servers never rushed us to finish the meal.

*I recommend the chef table or get a seat at the back as you will get to oversee the chefs preparing your food. 

*There weren't too many selections on the main menu, but definitely check out their daily menu! It just screams fresh and seasonal ingredients! 

*We were given some housemade chocolate when we got our bill. A bit too dark for me but nonetheless still delicious..

-Polenta Fries - $8: 
Despite the small portion, this is a must order!! The fries were crunchy on the outside, soft inside with just a slightly melted shredded cheese on top. Polenta itself can be bland, but these were salted just right with a delicious and tangy tomato sauce!

-Tuna Tartare - $9:
The tuna tartare was placed on top of a black pepper crisp, topped with crema, mint and pickled chilies. I didn't enjoy this dish as I felt the pickled chilies were so spicy that it prevented me from tasting the fresh tuna. The crema nor mint didn't help to ease the spiciness either, overall a very disappointing dish.

-Duo of Pork: Pork headcheese & pork loin - $25: 
The duo of pork consisted of panko crusted then deep fried pork head cheese and roasted pork loin; topped with pine nut, yogurt and all of this deliciousness sat on top of a tomato chickpeas ragu and roasted sweet potato. For those who don't know, head cheese is essentially a sausage or bologna made out of boiled pig head. I have had parts of the pork head in the past, however this was my first time to have the ENTIRE pork head. To be honest it had a standard pork flavors and texture, so don't be afraid! Also, these were panko crusted and deep fried, and as I always say, deep fry makes everything taste better! The pork loin was juicy, the ragu was hearty and amazing, however I found the sweet potato was a bit undercooked. Though the yogurt sauce might sound strange, the tanginess really helped to cut down the dish as it was quite heavy

-Sweet Potato & Cheddar Perogies - $23: 
Another must oder at Richmond Station! The perogies were soft and the seared crust added some texture and eliminated the stickiness. They were filled with cheddar and sweet potato, a bit on the heavy side but the accompanying beet puree and and tangy sour cream lightened up the meal. The caramelized onions, fennels and sauteed swiss chard paired well and helped to balance the dish. With that said, I didn't quite get the flavor of the cinnamon cap mushroom"}
{"text":"I can see why this place is so popular .. it's got a trendy yet casual vibe. I walked in with shorts on and felt very comfortable. We dabbled with some cancellations on a couple of prior occasions before finally making up our mind to dine here on a Tue night after catching a movie at cineplex Yonge Dundas. We were seated right away although the tables are too close to each other for any private conversations. Please stay away from the tuscan mojito cocktail - it wasn't refreshing at all and left a sour taste in my mouth. The food on the other hand was the upside. 

Scallop and corn pakoras
- Crunchy and light with the cilantro chutney adding the much needed elevation to the dish

Slowly cooked halibut with mushroom
- Divine. The spaetzle had the luxurious brown butter flavor to it and was the perfect bed for the halibut to rest on. 

Potato and ramp perogies
- Not your average fare and the sauteed swiss chard which I am usually not  big fan of was the surprise package. 

Chocolate sorbet with sweet berry soup
- Our server did not recommend this but we still took a chance. I regret this dish in hindsight. It was simple and boring, bitter and tart. The red wine soaked cake was dense and there were no interesting textures or contrasts to relish.

When the bill arrived, I decided to play a prank on the server. I placed my TTC metropass instead of a regular credit card. Our server was stunned and asked me if the TTC pass was valid which was lame since he did not get the joke :) They call it the \"Richmond station\", so I figured I should swipe my TTC metropass here :P Anyways, we had a hearty laugh about this and walked out with a smile on our faces."}
{"text":"So after a solid week of my friend suggesting this place, we finally decided to check it out. Complete package experience with absolutely no complaints!

For appetizers, we ordered the polenta fries and quinoa salad. Polenta fries were nicely fried. Crispy outside with creamy polenta on the inside with a bite of saltiness from the cheese on top. The fresh vegetables and soy hummus in the quinoa salad helped bring all the natural flavors of these ingredients to the forefront while having a fresh crisp with every bite. Definitely one of the best things I've eaten in a while.

For my main course, I ordered the rabbit 2 ways. It came with a rabbit rabbit leg and rabbit croquette, served with cooked vegetables, scallion dumplings, and a sweet carrot purée. The rabbit leg was extremely tender and juicy. The meat was not as gamy as I imagined it being. I believe a little bit of lime in the croquette would've added that extra bite that needed. Vegetables were all cooked perfectly and the dumplings paired surprisingly well with the purée. 

For dessert, I ordered a blueberry and corn dessert. It came with a candied leaf topped on ice cream. Surprisingly was not overly sweet and exceeded my expectations (not a fan of sweets and desserts in general).

Service was amazing! Silverware was swapped out between the appetizer, main course, and dessert. Crumbs were cleaned off the table after the quinoa appetizer. Food came in at a timely manner and servers explained went in to give in depth detail of the dish being served.

I will definitely be coming back here again, when I'm back in the area. Thank you for the wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a week day. Entrance is not easy to spot, you need to look for the slightly tricky sign. 

Walked into the entrance and was greetly warmly by the hostess. The restaurant is cozy, almost like a small, family owned restaurant. We ordered from the regular lunch menu and I was pleasantly surprised. 

Food took slightly longer to come, especially on the longer side for weekday lunch in downtown. Our waitress was super nice. Would come back again!"}
{"text":"This is the top place in Toronto for a reason! Minus the unwelcoming host, this place is the best. We started with the cod cakes and butternut squash soup. Neither were home runs, the soup was meh and the cod cakes were okay. Our entrees however were record making, bases loaded, grand slam homers. I got the trout. The server told me it was full of flavor and he was right. The sauces, the veggies all divine and perfectly complimented the trout. My boyfriend got the eurobass and it was even BETTER than the trout, I know I couldn't believe it either. It took all I had not to like the lemon hollandaise sauce off the plate! The brussle sprouts were nice and charred, my boyfriend had to almost fork me to make me stop eating his food. The finale was their chocolate bar, it was a special, and it was decadent and either side had a different flavor. One was more peanut butter with nuts and the other was raspberry. I love ending a meal with chocolate so it was great they had that special as nothing in their dessert menu is chocolate. I can't wait to visit Toronto again so I can show my friends this place!"}
{"text":"Known for their burger and for good reason, it's creative and delicious. The head chef loves to talk about his food and show guests his process. There's even special seating that allows you to peer into the bustling kitchen."}
{"text":"We got the tasting menu and we were not disappointed. This is one of the best meals I've ever had in Toronto. So many courses, we were stuffed. 
All of them were artwork for the eyes and the flavours were so interesting and delicious. 
The rabbit course was my favourite for sure. I'd never had it before and I would love to have it again."}
{"text":"Wow.. amazing. Spectacular

By far, the best burger I ever had. Made reservation for a Saturday night for 10pm. We were able to sit at the chef table, which I highly recommend. Chef table puts you in front of the action for the grill, dessert, and broiler.

The service was perfect. Water was always refilled and before I was able to ask my question they already answered. 

The burger. Wow. It was delicious. Cooked perfectly. And the fries. OMG. You know the fries are good when they don't need any condiments.

Dessert was amazing too. We are pretty late and the lady was so nice since we were one of the last tables to put our orders in. She even gave us an extra treat. The perks of sitting at the chef table.

If you're visiting or a local, please make a reservation. It will exceed your expectations."}
{"text":"You could definitely walk by and miss this place. The restaurant is narrow, but there is a back area that you can't see from the store front. 

The food is a bit pricey for what it is, but its located in financial district. We both got various fish entrees...both were okay, but not great. Where they really excel is their desserts. The desserts were amazing and definitely the highlight of the meal. 

The atmosphere was nice, but there were a table of 3 people beside us, then a bunch of their friends came and started crowding around the table. It was very annoying and don't understand why the restaurant allowed them to stand around. Definitely ruined the ambiance of the place with their loud talking and crowding around me. Did not feel very comfortable at all."}
{"text":"Since my last review, I've been back multiple times for lunch and the different prix-fixe options. One of the things I love about this place is the constantly-changing but still small menu. I've tried (additionally) the quinoa and hummus salad loaded with different ingredients, sweet potato soup, the mexican cheesecake with jalapeno ice cream and the milk chocolate cheesecake with apple chutney off the current menu. The prix-fixe lunch is great value and they usually offer an appetizer with a main for $21. I've tried the lamb orecchiette and roast porchetta and the latter was so good I ordered it twice on two occasions. 
It's always very busy every time we've visited, regardless of the time of the day but we've gotten by without reservations and very minimal wait times. I would recommend being seated at the chef's table at least once - you get to view your meal being prepared and observe all the cookware and equipment at work."}
{"text":"Great food, great place. Too pricy but always worth it- or so I think. hah"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service. Great spring rolls, salads, and burgers. Super gluten free friendly as well - I was able to have an amazing gluten free burger and bun. Great place to eat on our visit!"}
{"text":"Wow what an experience. From the extremely knowledgeable server to the lovely setting at the chef table. You can watch the chefs in action. The food was top notch. The pate was sooo good. The burger was unbelievable and so was the rabbit. There was also swordfish on the menu which I am sure was delicious too. Nice choices on the beverage menu. It was my wife's birthday and it was a memorable dinner. It's not inexpensive but so worth it. There are other restaurant which are hyped and are not worth the money. You wont  go wrong with Richmond Station....this is a gem."}
{"text":"I love the burger. My only complaint is that the place is loud."}
{"text":"We went to Richmond Station restaurant for dinner. The restaurant is nicely decorated and the service was excellent. It was hard to find and we walked by it.

We started with the beef tartare. We got 4 pieces of beef tartare on cracker which was very good. I had the rabbit two ways for my main dish. I think one portion of the rabbit was fried while the other portion was baked. The rabbit was tasty while my friend enjoyed her duck duo dish.

The only quibble I had with the restaurant was that the portions were kind of small and I was hungry afterward. Still, I would recommend this restaurant to anybody who enjoy fine dining."}
{"text":"High quality food, would definitely come back! Came here with a group of friends and we had a great experience. I had the ricotta ravioli which was delicious. Would like to try the station burger next time! 

Desserts were also creative and visually appealing, would recommend as well!"}
{"text":"Incredible food, and deceivingly filling.

I had the roasted eggplant-based appetizer, and fish as my main. Both were delicious, blended multiple flavours, and incorporate different textures. Even the accompaniments, like the sauces on my plate were delicious on their own! Plus, the free bread is one of the best I've had and  ensures you leave this place full."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for lunch, and both times, the food and service have been top notch. I ordered the quinoa salad and cioppino soup the first time and the roasted carrot salad the second time, and all dishes were stand-outs. The flavours were all deliciously balanced, and I was really impressed with how well the staff knew the menu. I will definitely be back, thanks Richmond Station!!"}
{"text":"The food and service were both fantastic. Our server was friendly and knew her wines well, and had great recommendations on the menu. The place is known for their smoked meats, and their charcuterie board was delicious - each variety was unique and so tasty. The special of the evening was scallops, and they were cooked to perfection. Dessert was an interesting combination of ingredients - which created such a scrumptious finish to our meal! Would definitely come back. Make reservations!"}
{"text":"Best value meal in Toronto. Quality and execution can't be beat for the price. Ive been here twice now and everything thing is exceptional!"}
{"text":"Came by for lunch the other day and was super lucky to be seated upon arrival! Restaurant was modern and upscale, located in the heart of downtown Toronto!

Service by the staff was over the top to the perfection making the experience super comfortable! 

Ordered the Station Burger which was phenomenal! Patty was cooked to a perfect medium rare and even featured short rib inside the burger! The bun was very fresh! The fries looked simple and they tasted heavenly! 

...will have to make another visit the next time I'm in town to try out their dinner!

~$30/head after tax and gratuity for lunch."}
{"text":"First off, the restaurant was very accommodating of changing our reservation time from an off peak time slot to a busy time slot on the day of the reservation which I appreciated.

The wine menu is superb. I would have surely opted for a bottle had I not been drinking beer earlier in the day. 

For starters, we had the Swordfish tacos. These bite sized tacos were packed with flavor! They were fresh and had a very refreshing taste. We also had the lamb croquettes over hummus. The croquettes were similar to falafel. 

For the main course, we split the butter poached halibut. The fish was soft and pleasantly flavored. It was plated along with sweet potato slices over a bed of chickpeas and greens with a spicy tomato sauce. 

We couldn't leave without trying one of Richmond Station's city famous desserts. We shared a dish called Acid test. I've never come across a dish like this. On a round plate was a center filled with ice cream and a cream. Scattered around was a tasteless cake and small tofu like cubes. Around the plate was various syrups with both recognizable and unfamiliar flavors. The idea was to dip the bites and creams into the drizzled syrups. It's a must try dish because of the uniqueness."}
{"text":"You may be thinking: why would I order a burger at a place like this? Well, the wait staff may not let you turn it down and you'll find it's one of the tastiest burgers ever crafted. I also ordered the red onion pakoras and cherry blossom dessert. All were fantastic!"}
{"text":"I went there last night w/my friend to try somewhere new for dinner. She had been there a couple times in the past and raved about it.

We arrive around 4:45pm and it appeared to be closed, there was no one in there but it was in fact opened. We stood at the front and waited for about 10mins for someone to greet us, but saw a kitchen staff walk by a couple times and ignore us - not so much as a \"hello\" or \"one moment please!\".

The hostess finally comes around and offers to seat us, we did not have reservations and while the place was completely empty, and we were a bit indecisive of where we wanted to sit (It was a tad chilly, so being away from the door was ideal). She informed us of a reservation at one seat for 7:00pm and another table we picked had a reservation for 7:45pm .. mind you, it wasn't even 5:00pm yet and the place was still empty and the upstairs area was being occupied for a meeting.

So, we decided to wait for the meeting to finish because I dont want to sit somewhere and then have to get up if I decide to have another glass of wine, dessert or if I'm feeling extra chatty.

Overall, the service was fine (nothing bad, nothing superior) and I would say the food was okay as well. I ordered the fried chicken (special) and the scallops on kale rather than the roasted potatoes. I would have to agree with everyone in saying that the portions are in fact small, a tad smaller than your standard gastro-type resto and the menu is small as well.

The fried chicken was good, I would prefer if the pieces were a bit saucier (the sauce is thicker and spread on the bottom of the chicken), only because the chicken is deep fried and it would've been a better balance of flavour. The scallops are small (not huge), but you do receive about 4-5 and the sauce was tasty and fit well with the seafood - I would probably go with the potatoes next time and not the kale.

Overall, the experience was OK - I probably wouldn't go back, too many amazing options in Toronto to settle for alright and the service/hostess experience turned me off as well. I'm not interested in hearing about reservations 2 hours from now, either this is reservation only and you put me on a list - or you seat me and my party and go from there. Client experience is critical anywhere, especially @ a restaurant."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place and unlike most, it really didn't disappoint. From the overall atmosphere to the food/wine itself it was a great experience. 

I got the Caesar salad and Coq Au Vin. Caesar was way different take but I enjoyed the mix of Brussel sprouts and anchovy. The Coq Au Vin was really spot on- great blend of flavor and good sized portion. 

Would love to try the chefs table next time but really any seat is a good seat there."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here Monday night to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. We had heard amazing things and were NOT disappointed. 

We sat at the chefs table, which at first we were a little nervous about but it was actually a really unique experience. We also opted fo the tasting menu instead of ordering off the menu. They said it was 7 courses plus desert, but with 2 salads and 2 deserts it ended up being more like 10 courses. Each course blew us away. The scallop was my favourite, and my boyfriend loved the beef tartare. It took us about 2 and a half hours to get through our dinner, which was great since we were on a nice date and wanted out take our time. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable, and anticipated all our needs before we even knew we needed anything. 

I would highly recommend Richmond Station to anyone looking for fresh, quality, creative dishes. Thank you to all the staff for making our night out one to remember."}
{"text":"I am sorry, but for all the hype we were expecting way more. The level of ingredient quality was good but for the money it just didn't measure up.
Sevice was ok but \"everything is good\" just isn't what I want as guidance in food selection.
Flavors were tired and unispired. Cocktails were excellent though.

Shares:
Maple cured trout, ok but a lot like one half of a lox and bagle.
We had a rosted garlic \"donut\" with kimchi which just tasted like deep fried dough.

Duck to ways, flavor was good overall the best selection.
Beef two ways little tough and mediocre also a little cold.

Need more from an expensive establishment."}
{"text":"What a great place to eat.

The service was good, the waiters were friendly.

Do - order the Beef CARPACCIO - (arugula, radish, toscano and some more good stuff)

Do - Order the station burger, can't go wrong with this, the chutney makes takes it from good to amazing

Do - Order the Jerk Chicken. It's not like your Jamaican jerk chicken but better. The chef has really paid attention to every. single. flavour. in the dish.

Didn't have a reservation but the accommodated us. 

Will go back."}
{"text":"ENVIRONMENT - it's a narrow restaurant with regular tables and communal tables in which guests sit beside each other. It's wonderfully decorated, and I love the little details with the hooks underneath the table so you can hang your purse. 

SERVICE - very attentive and friendly!

FOOD - The dishes are beautifully presented, but didn't wow
+polenta fries $8: it's essentially almost a dollar per fry. This was raved in most Yelp reviews so I had to try it. Not bad, but didn't amaze me and I wouldnt go out of the way to order this again if I came back, imo.

+ halibut special of the day $28: the halibut is wonderfully cooked, and its paired with this white bean puree which I quite liked to my surprise (i normally don't like beans). The veggies that came with the dish were delicious as well, and had a great crunch to them (i wish i could the exact names of them). Overall, would recommend.

+sea buckthorn posset $9: comes with blueberry sorbet that's in an adorable round lemon kind of shape, wildflower cake that's crumbled on the plate, apricot rose puree, sorghum fruits. I  thought this was a very unique dessert presentation. I wouldve enjoyed it a lot more if I liked posset (this is kind of like yogurt with a more tangy taste). I'd get the japanese cheesecake next time (my frd has this and was absolutely delicious)! 

They give you a cool postcard when you pay! It adds a nice touch haha. I'd want to come back and try the tasting menu for about $60pp."}
{"text":"Richmond Station was a good business lunch.

The food was good, relatively quick, and fresh. We had a beet salad with fresh, seasonal greens and decent goat cheese, some cheese ravioli, and a honey dessert. All were good, but none were incredible. The portions were smaller than I would've liked (especially the pasta) for the price.

The ambiance was good but a little detached, perfect for a business lunch. We went on a Tuesday, and it seemed that was the restaurant's main clientele. 

Service was good, but a little slow. The waiter was friendly and gave good suggestions. We were seated very quickly, and it seemed that the place ran efficiently, especially considering the number of seats. 

Overall, I enjoyed Richmond Station, and would definitely go again for a lunch with coworkers."}
{"text":"This restaurant is on Richmond street across from the Bay.  It's a very small restaurant and you can easily walk by it without even know it's there.  

The food is amazing!  Their food ranges from sharable tapas to regular size entrees.  The prices are expensive but the quality is amazing so you do get your money's worth.  Make sure you leave room for dessert.  Their desert dishes are quite unique, different and tasty at the same time.  Service is attentive and friendly.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a nice date night."}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant we have been to in Toronto! We ordered from the special board. The scallops were out of this world, and the beef special was tender and juicy. The cocktails were good but not as good as the food. The \"candy bar\" dessert special was memorable (even though it didn't last long). Also a very cozy and warm ambience. We hope to come back here soon!"}
{"text":"From the moment I called to make a reservation, I received stellar service from Richmond Station. When we initially made our res, she asked us if it was a special occasion (it was our anniversary), and we were greeted at the restaurant with complimentary champagne. Such a nice touch. Also worth noting that they were extremely accommodating to dietary restrictions.

The food was...next level. Delicious. Transcendental. And the price, for what we got, was very reasonable.

We had heard overwhelmingly positive things about Richmond Station, and now I understand why! Excellent service, excellent food, and a really memorable evening."}
{"text":"As always, salivating as I'm writing this. 

The taste of the Quinoa Salad that was left unfinished is still under my teeth. 

Great place! We had a table by the kitchen and I could peek through where all the magic was happening. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"VIBE 
Kudos for the central location. I think this was the Purple Cow before. There's not a lot of great options in and around the Eaton Centre that are relatively affordable and non-douchey so this works. Anyways, it just works. It doesn't look like too much on the outside but the inside is inviting. Dim lighting, casual vibe but elegant and sophisticated too. Obviously, it's taking on the train theme and the photos and tiles in the bathroom illustrate this without it looking gimmicky. 

WE ATE 
Love those polenta fries. The sauces were okay - no kick but it's nice not to have something that's overly spicey. 
Dining Companion had the lobster bisque and she was very satisfied. A note on the bread: loved that they took another route with olive oil and paired it with maple syrup. It's different and I like it! 

I had the wild boar ragu with hand made orecchiette, tomato and  toscana cheese. It was a decent sized portion without making me feel stuffed. Perfectly executed and not too gooey. It just worked. The boar was tender and succulent. The flavours complemented that. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Forget the TTC. I'll be dropping by this station again. Whaa Whaa. 
I will say that $23 is a bit excessive for a medium sized pasta dish. But it was a decent dinner. This is a good option for a business lunch, after work with a colleague or catching up with a girlfriend."}
{"text":"Even though my friends and I did not have a reservation, we were able to get a table for 6 on a Saturday night with only half an hour notice - a very welcoming surprise! It was the first time for all of us, so we played it kind of safe and all ordered cod cakes and jerk chicken wraps to start,the station burger for the main, and a carrot cake with caramel and ginger ice cream for dessert. The cod cakes were delicious. The jerk chicken wraps were just okay, and the burger was really good. I'm not sure I'd rush to say it was my favorite burger, but the fact that all the ingredients were made in house, and that it wasn't a typical burger meant I enjoyed it a little more than most good burgers. The best part of my meal, looking back, was definitely the dessert. SO GOOD!!! Highly recommended if you like carrot cake, although be aware that the portion is small. A solid 4/5. Would go again."}
{"text":"The chefs tasting menu was very interesting.  Tried 8 different dishes ... each was very creative.

Highly recommend that you give this Top chef winner Restaurant a try.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have had in such a fun low key casual environment! We were in Toronto for business and needed a place for dinner - so glad we found this spot!! Awesome!! Karen was our server and we told her that we wanted to try as many things as possible - she did not disappoint-- we started with the duck pâté which was whipped and creamy on a pretzel cracker that is almost as thin as a potato chip - this was one of those moments when you just stop and savor the moment!! We moved on to the charcuterie and it was just amazing - packed full of flavor!! On to the beet salad - which had roasted beets and beet chips on a bed of arugula over a yogurt tzatziki sauce - this is something I want to eat every day!! Then we moved on to the lamb special - which was two types of cuts over a celeriac purée with Brussel sprouts, potatoes, carrots and a lamb au jus!! Whoa - so good!! For dessert instead of something sweet we went for the cheese plate - really delish! Again our server Karen was fantabulous - guided us perfectly through the menu!!"}
{"text":"First Impressions...came here for lunch..

I felt I had entered a private social club by mistake...very \"cult\" like culture and atmosphere ..surprisingly there is Country music playing in the back ground but the vibe is a bit off..my jacket was taken and I was given a number so mini coat check service you can say is provided....

I was seated upstairs where I had a choice to be seated at the chefs table which is basically an open window opened to the chef station into the kitchen and if you're wearing your Gucci or Versace the oil might jump up and bite you...so I opted for the more outfit savvy table against the wall where I was able to observe the whole commotion around me..

The crowd here was equally mixed from your bankers, to Techies, to your House Wives of Toronto..All awaiting the great chefs creations...

My server was extremely sweet, friendly, and knowledgeable about the dishes served...Right away my server asked for my dietary restrictions, which was amazing..trust me with EPI Pen shortages in Ontario we don't want any drama at lunch (-;

I ordered their House made kombucha infused with Rosemary and tea it was deliciously aged and equally soothing...ahhhh my gut was thanking me as I was drinking it...

Black Cod was: freshest fish I have tasted like it was just caught, immersed in the melody of white beans, purée, spinach, just delish!

After thoughts ...

Great place to enjoy wholesome meals with an eclectic twist."}
{"text":"The stellar reviews DON'T LIE!! Believe the amazing rating that Richmond Station has because its 110% accurate.

I came here with my family for our annual Christmas dinner outing; we were a group of 6 and we had an 8PM reservation. We arrived and it was quite busy and it never really quieted down, and for good reason. They're doing a crazy good business in this place. We stood by the front while we waited for out table to be ready; Richmond Station isn't a large joint so we were sort of milling around a high table and ordered a few drinks to start. We were seated pretty promptly near the back where the chefs table is. 

We all had looked at the menu, but for me, nothing was standing out as \"I really want THAT\". I wanted to try the burger, since its been touted as the best burger in the city, but to come to Richmond Station (we've been trying to get a reservation here for YEARS at Christmas time) and get a burger... seemed.... almost sacrilegious? 

After perusing the menu, our server came by and made a suggestion of doing the chefs table for our party. We would give them our likes/dislikes and he'd create a menu custom for our table. We had one person who's picky who was on the fence, but after discussing, we opted to go for the chefs table. Best. Decision. Ever.

We got to try a number of fantastic dishes off the menu that we wouldn't necessarily have tried otherwise. Our only stipulation was that we wanted no seafood. We had a six course meal that was to die for. Most courses were plated family style, so we could help ourselves from a large platter or bowl. 

We started with a share course: we had some oysters to start (delicious) and some polenta fries. The polenta fries were lovely, I had never thought of using polenta like that, but they were great! They also brought out the duck liver pate.. my absolute FAVOURITE. The pate itself was light as a feather, almost whipped, and sinfully delicious!!

Next was an absolutely fabulous charcuterie - the touches on the charcuterie just put it over the top. Lovely grainy mustards, pickled vegetables, beets, just amazing with the fantastic selection of meats. 

Our next course was a selection of their salads, which included quinoa salad, a beet salad and a roasted carrot salad. All of which were absolutely incredible. My father commented that he wasn't super interested in the quinoa salad at first but it ended up being the table favourite. Such amazing flavors pulled together!

We had a mushroom ravioli, which was incredibly rich and decadent. The portions for this course were small (on purpose) but I know that there's no way I could have eaten a full portion of the ravioli! Such an amazing mouthful of pasta but SO very rich!

For the mains, they brought out rabbit two ways, served family style and two station burgers that had been quartered for us to share. I was really pleased that we got to try both of these dishes - the rabbit was incredible, I've never had rabbit before and one was fried with breading and it was AMAZING. They had daikon in with the rabbit but after trying some, I learned I'm not a fan of daikon, so I just avoided it. The burger was truly one of the best burgers I've had. Wonderful mouth feel, wonderful toppings, just expertly put together.

To finish, we had the special dessert, which I can't quite remember but it included a mocha ice cream and \"snow\" merangue pieces with some kind of mousse I think. We were all so full but the dessert was just the icing on the cake for the end of the meal. Perfection.

Drinks were fun, lots of neat names and some really interesting concoctions. 

Richmond Station is a must see for anyone visiting who's a foodie. You won't regret having to wait for a reservation, its SO completely worth it. So, what are you waiting for?! :D"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a really cool hole-in-the-wall vibe. The service was super fast, efficient, and friendly. I had the seared digby scallops with spetzle, spinach, and a delicious parsley purée. It was surprisingly filling and (not surprisingly) delicious! My friends had the station burger, which was cooked to medium-rare perfection. My boyfriend had the fennel pierogies with a beet purée that matched well with the bitter taste of the sautéed kale. All in all a great experience!"}
{"text":"I wanted to plan something special for my friend's birthday, and knew that he had never tried a chef's tasting menu before, so I really wanted him to have that experience. So off I went to investigate the options available to us. I did put a couple of limitations that I took into consideration when reviewing the tasting menus in Toronto. 1) that it not exceed $100 per person; 2) that the tasting offer more than 5 dishes. 

After a great deal of research (reading reviews and looking at pictures), I narrowed the options to 3.
* Rasa
* Richmond Station
* Bar Isabel

In the end however, the natural choice was Richmond Station. The reviews were simply amazing, and after contacting the restaurant with a few questions - their great customer service, and patience made them a \"must visit\" for me. 

The planning:

Communicated with the restaurant over e-mail, and always received a prompt response to my queries.  The actual birthday was on a Sunday, but they are closed on Sundays, so I scheduled the dinner for a Thursday evening and specifically requested to sit at the chef's table. I told the restaurant that this was a birthday dinner, and they confirmed that they would be adding a candle to the dessert.  

The day of the dinner: 

My guest arrived first because I was stuck in traffic, and when I walked in late, it was great to see how excited he looked to be sitting by the kitchen.  My friend is a fantastic cook, and I knew that front row seats to the action would make him happy - and I was right! 
My friend had already ordered a drink, and seemed to have been well taken care of. 

Immediately after I sat down our waitress introduced herself and gave us a breakdown of what to expect that evening. Again, my friend looked excited and a tad confused because he had no idea what was happening (hehe!). \"Where is the menu?\" his confused look said. 

The food:

OH.MY.GOD! 9 courses! And as we had each course, we thought to ourselves, \"there is no way anything can taste better than this!\" WRONG! The food just kept getting better and better! The sequence of the dishes were perfectly timed and chosen - we started with oysters, followed by a scallop ceviche, charcuterie board, 2 salads, salmon & gnocchi, ravioli, venison and 2 desserts. 

The only dishes I was not a fan of were the desserts. They were tasty, but by the point we got our desserts, I was so full, and extremely pleased with the meal, that not loving the desserts was not a big deal. However, my guest loved the desserts, and ultimately the dinner was for him, so yeh! And, they did not forget the candle! 

Service: 

We had several waiters check-in on us, and bring the food out. And every one of them was friendly, professional, and well versed on the food and menu. My friend always has tons of questions about the food and ingredients, and they were more than happy to answer them all. Personally, I would not have been that patient!

Would we return?

HELL YES! To this day we can't stop talking about this meal. And this dinner happened in July! We had nothing negative to say about the food (except my dislike of the desserts - though I am in the minority), and when we dine out now, most meals pale in comparison to the food we had at Richmond Station. 

Though we are eager to return, I am worried that if we return, and the meal is not as spectacular as the one we had in July, that it could tarnish the amazing memories we made during our first time here. So we have decided that Richmond Station will be the restaurant we will return to for only special occasions. Plus, after having the tasting menu, we can't see ourselves ordering from the regular menu. A lot of the fun was not knowing what we would be trying next. 

Highlights:

* Amazing service
* Talented chefs
* Watching the staff put together incredible meals with skill and precision and not realizing that they were putting together our dishes! *A lot of our dishes were put together behind the scenes and this was done to keep us in suspense. But on occasion, the dishes were put together in front of us, but we never knew it was for us until they walked it to our table. Once during the dinner I turned to my friend and noted how amazing the dish one chef was putting together looked, and seconds later the chef walked over to us with the dish I had been eyeing with awe. 
* The price - $70 per person (I personally thought this was an amazing deal when taking into account the quality, freshness, portion size, and skill that went into every dish - plus, the food was freaking DELICIOUS!)
* At the end of the meal we received the bill with a couple pieces of chocolates/brownies. But I was so full, that I could not eat another bite. In jest I told our waitress how I wish I could take the chocolates home with me, and seconds later she returned with a plastic container filled with these chocolates! Love her! 

In sum: 

GO! Make a reservation today! You will not be disappointed! My experience here is one I will never forget."}
{"text":"I had a really great experience at Richmond Station.

Came at lunch with a friend, they were very accommodating despite that we didn't have a reservation at a very busy time.

We ordered cocktails (which were interesting, and very lovingly made), and entrees. I have celiac disease, and the waitress was incredibly knowledgeable about what on the menu was naturally gluten free, as well as for what substitutions could be made. I ordered their burger (which came on a gluten-free biscuit), and they subbed fries for a batch of gluten-free roasties that they whipped up just for me.

Service was great, everyone who worked there was super friendly, chatty, and knowledgeable about the menu and dietary restrictions. Cool, unpretentious atmosphere. Overall, incredibly impressed with this place. They live up to their reputation and hype, and I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now and they never disappoint. 
I've ordered from the regular menu and the tasting menu. Can't go wrong with either option.  
Service was great! 
Cozy atmosphere. 
The place looks very unassuming and we even walked past it the first time that we went there."}
{"text":"Richmond station... I have a lot of mixed feelings about this place. I had made reservations in front of the open kitchen. I really enjoyed watching the chefs cook and garnish each dish. I was really excited to order due to the aroma from the food in front of me!

LAMB NECK CROQUETTES (3.5/5) - The starter was very dissapointing. I felt like I was eating over priced falafels with small pieces of lamb. I would not recommend this dish at all. 

RABBIT 2 WAYS (4.5/5) - The presentation was very colorful and well put together. After being dissapointed by the starter, I did not want to hold any false expectations. My first bite into the rabbit, I felt a sense of relief. It was very moist and cooked to perfection. The garnish were very well put together as they compliment the rabbit very nicely. The flavours were rich and I was very satisfied with the meal. 

Daily Special Dessert (4/5) - I had ordered the daily special. When the dessert had arrived, the presentation was breathtaking. The dish was very colorful and very well put together. The choices on the palate were well thought of due to the balance between the crunchy and soft textures. 

Overall, the experience was enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! I fell in love with this place!! Food is super delicious. Daily features that are to die for. The entire menu is creative and fuses different flavours in an incredible way. And the service, the service is unlike anywhere else I have found before. They are friendly, attentive, knowledgable about the menu and ingredients. Our waitress was so nice and accommodating. Great wine selection, charcuterie (aged at the station), craft beer and cocktails (new creations and the classics). 

I am so glad I stumble upon this restaurant. Originally from Vancouver I wish Richmond station was closer to home. We liked it so much we had to go back for an encore before heading home. And will definitely come back. Whatever you order you can't go wrong. The soup and the burger are a must."}
{"text":"Nice decor and atmosphere. I got the pierogies and while it seemed pricey for pierogies, it was very delicious. They were bigger than expected and had a nice crisp to the skin. It was worth the cost. I tried some of my friends' food as well and everyone's was equally delicious. Yum."}
{"text":"I went in by myself for a quick lunch and a glass of wine.  It was very busy, but the hosting staff was lovely and found me a seat within a few minutes.  I got to sit in front of the chefs station and see them work while I ate.  I had the Peking duck pancakes, listed as shareable appetizer.  It was very small.  Four bites, but they were sublime.  I had apple mille feuille for dessert.  It was a deconstructed version with poppy seeds and stewed apples, but it was great.  With tax and tip, the appetizer, dessert and a glass of wine came to over $40, which is a bit much for the amount I ate, but it was delicious all the same. I'd save it for a special occasion in the future."}
{"text":"So I thought I wrote a review for this place already,  but it must not have posted.. found this place in the paper under support restaurants who source produce locally and support Ontario farmers. 

This review is reflective of the restaurant when I visited in the fall. 

Stopped by for a lunch in a week day and was quite impressed. 

Service: top notch 

Food: Amazing! I love the fact that it's all local produce and seasonal so the menu changes. A little on the pricey side, so I ordered the lunch special which allowed me to try an appetizer and main in a smaller portion and it did not disappoint. Lots of flavour and the portions were a good size. Rosemary fries were delicious, beef was cooked well and the cold corn soup was very unique. I've never had a cold corn soup before so the creativity piqued my interest. 

Decor: business casual vibe, lots of business lunches going on, long communal table in the centre and more private seating in the back. 

Their sign is small so keep your head up, there was some construction at the time so it was hard to find the entrance when I went. Hopefully construction is done now."}
{"text":"I'm constantly amazed at the level of professionalism both service and food quality wise for this gem of a restaurant. It is one of my top recommendations if you ever visit Toronto.

This time I went back to have the tasting menu and the value of the 7 courses (more like 8-9) was well worth the 70 dollars. If you go as a pair then you get to try and share 2 dishes per course for some of your mains.

1st course oyster and beer tartare duo... very fresh and savory oyster. The crispy beef fat fried potato Mille-feuille I thought was delicious on its own, but slightly overpowered the delicate freshness of the beef tartare when eaten together.

2nd course chicken in lettuce wrap. Quite refreshing and tasty but not my favorite of the night

3rd course charcuterie board.
Oh so delicious.... they brought back the fried pork cheek triangle thing!!!!!!*** maybe they heard my constant whining about why they took that off... arguably one of the most delicious pork bites you will ever have in your life. The rest of the board paired well and was standard, consisting of 5 different types of meat and pates paired with mustard, sweet beet jam and pickled vegetables.

4th course 
Duck liver pate... mind blowingly delicious, paired with a cherry reduction served on perfectly toasted buttery brioche. One of my favorite bites of food all year.

5th
Cauliflower agnolotti very creamy and delicious, but could have used some more acidic components to cut the richness 

6th course 
Grilled mahi-mahi ... perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked not dry at all (if you ever tasted a charred burnt to bits mahi-mahi you would know what I'm talking about).. chili and vegetables added a nice zing to the dish

7th course 
Most grand and bold course of the night... drum rolls ... stuffed pig trotter a la tribute to Pierre Kaufman? Anyways, very savory sausage favored with fennel and sage stuffed into a gloriously shiny deboned pig trotter. It was to die for! The Demi glaze sauce was deep in flavor and color while managing not to be too oily. Considering the care, time and technique that goes into this, I would have paid 30 dollars for that dish alone. One small hiccup was that not all of the small hairs were burned off with a blow torch during the prep stage near the feet end of the hock. This affected the texture for a couple of bites. If I was an anal food critic this might bother me but alas I'm not. All in all great dish and there is a reason why it's considered a classic! 

8th course dessert. Fall inspired pumpkin custard with coffee crumble, rye crisp and citrus foam. I'm not a big fan of pumpkin but it worked well when eaten together with the coffee crumble.
The other chocolate rocky road dessert was tasty but forgettable. Wasn't a fan of the background burnt/smoke flavor. 
Dessert plating was top notch.


Finally shout out to the service staff who corrected their own mistake of mis ordering my drink.  please ... take my 20 %tip you definitely deserve it for that level of professionalism. Also the kitchen staff was fun to watch if you get to seat at the bar... quite the \"theatre\" experience."}
{"text":"Hands down the best casual to semi formal dining restaurant in the city.  You absolutely should make a reservation as this place is packed daily for dinner however they're closed on Sundays so don't bother coming then.  The menu is all seasonal fare with some daily regular items and a lovely selection of beers on tap and sone wonderful wine selection.  The food is all prepared in house with the meats also being butchered in house as well.  A little known fact is they have one of the best priced tasting menus in the city by far at 65 dollars a person with a 6-8 course menu that is seasonal and occasionally is done with every dish being unique to the diner.  If you do plan to try the tasting menu it's sadly by reservation only as it's not on the menu so plan ahead and come regularly.

You may or may not know the owner and chef of Richmond station as he won Top Chef Canada a few years back and opened this place he's a very humble guy and took us for a tour of the kitchen and posed for photos.

The wait staff is personable and friendly and the service is on par with the top end restaurants in the city never had to ask for water or anything it all came out smoothly.

Hope you enjoy the dining experience like I have as it's my monthly choice for place to go to eat and have recommended it to coworkers and friends with high praise and regard

Also an after note the place is very easy to miss it's right on Richmond street next to an indoor parking garage with a glass door and a simple sign above the entrance."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a fabulous lunch here recently.  I really like the vibes of this place as soon as I walked in.  The place isn't very big so be sure to make reservations.  I was really impressed with the service.  The waiters changed our plates and cutlery and cleaned off the table after we finished our appetizer and were very attentive in refilling our water.

My friend and I like to share so we ordered the Prix Fixe Lunch and the Grilled Cornish Hen.  The Prix Fixe lunch is a great deal that comes with one appetizer and a main for $22.  We selected the quinoa salad instead of the beet soup as starter and the braised beef as the main.  Really liked the flavouring in the Cornish hen dish.  Everything was delicious.

I heard the burger is a must try so I'll be back for sure to try it!"}
{"text":"I came here again with my coworkers for celebrations. They set up a table for us at the back of the room near kitchen, so we could see all the actions in the kitchen. 

Most of us opt for the prix fixe lunch. By the time we order (around 12:45pm), one of the main course items was almost sold out. 

We shared the Duck Liver Pate and Beef Tartare. Very creamy, mousse like Duck liver pate was served on the toast. We also love it and said we were like eating the dessert. 

Beef Tartare was served on a crispy potato Pastry. We were amazed by the pastry more than the beef Tartare although it was great too. 

I had the quinoa salad for starter. It was refreshing and I love they combine different textures in one dish, crispy potato chips, hummus, kale, ranch source, quinoa. 

Roast Pork Shoulder was presented nicely the bed of button mushroom, mostarda with mushroom cream sauce and kale on top. When I cut up the pork, I thought it was dry but when I put it in the mouth, it was so tender!

My coworkers praised their Venison Chilli as well. They said it didn't taste like chilli but very nice dish. But mind you that was spicy. 

I have looked at their dessert on Internet  and it was beautiful, so we decided to try. At first, we thought they were drinks because they name them Bubble Tea, Piña Colada. If I didn't see the photos, I would have no clue. Since we ordered the prix fixe, the dessert was only $5 (half price!). The dessert were made with combination of different textures and tastes. My favourite was the Rhubarb Lassi (with rosewater ice cream) and Bubble Tea (Matcha, tapioca). The other two (Pina Colada and Rootbeer float) were too sweet for my liking. Overall, we all think the desserts were the star of the whole experience. 

Service was friendly and prompt. One of the dessert was on the house since we were celebrating for our coworkers. It was so nice of them. 

I would definitely come back for lunch. Mind you the portion is not big but I would say sufficient for lunch. The daily lunch prix fixe menu change regularly, so it would be great to come often to try different dishes."}
{"text":"Excellent. Both Service and food. Have tried almost everything on the menu and haven't had a bad thing. SECRET TIP: Not on the menu, but ask about the tasting menu. 5-6 different courses and truly the best way to taste the various first rate dishes the restaurant offers."}
{"text":"Totally exceeded expectations.  Great food and  friendly helpful service.  Lived up to the hype. I'm vegetarian and everything I ate was packed with flavour with high quality ingredients. I had the bean empanadas to start... Not a must have but still good. Main meal was the perrogie dish... Amazing. The flavours were amazing! Desert was the Greek yogurt dish which I only ordered bc it was recommended by our server. Great choice. Best restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Came here before but the experience was not worth commenting.

However this time the experience was a lot better. The dishes were all chose in my group has various dimensions of flavour and textures. It was enjoyed by everyone.

Forgot the dish I first ordered (guess it wasn't interesting) but today I had the Rabbit Two ways and wow was it something special. Plating, as I remember, was always very suburb at both my visits but this dish also provided very nice flavours and paired very well with the Rabbit.

Definitely will come back again, next time probably try the kitchen side seats.

Note: There is bread which can be requested for."}
{"text":"Ordered: Swordfish conserva, Lamb neck croquettes, Butter poached halibut, Acid taste test

Pros--The swordfish's components (slaw, acidity from lime juice, fish) worked perfectly together. The lamb dish was incredible. The crust tasted like fried chickpeas and the inside was savory lamb. It came with fresh tzatziki sauce and it was garnished with dill. I'm not a big fish person but the halibut was one of the best fish dishes I've ever had. It was light and came with these great balsamic-glazed, pickled onions. 

Cons--The swordfish tacos came in 2 and were ridiculously small. The acid taste test (dessert), although unusual, was more visually appealing than anything else. The dessert was essentially chunks of angel food cake with colorful syrups squirted on the plate. I would definitely skip this next time."}
{"text":"I had the Quinoa Salad and Fried Chicken special today.  The salad was delightful and the chicken was not as great as my grandmother from Alabama but stil quite tasty.  The service was okay--could probably use a little improvement.  All in all I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really over rated. Limited menu and they seem to always run out of specials. One would think during tiff week they'd plan for larger crowds. 

Ordered the chili special but was sold out. Then ordered the chicken. They gave me 2 different types one teeny last piece of the roasted chicken then they sauted a piece of breast meat, server tried to tell me it lost its skin. 

I guess just go early. Small servings of wine for hefty prices."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Richmond Station!
Not only are the meals composed and well thought out, but its a good size for a restaurant.. I also love being able to observe the chefs doing what they do best.
The menu is well thought out and the plates look gorgeous.
Great before a show or sporting event!"}
{"text":"Great burger and friendly staff.  
I've heard this resturant has the best burger.  The burger was great. The patty is not too heavily pack and it's juicy.  There is a sweet sauce and great cheese on it.  Love the favor.  One thing I would like to point they are a bit pricy.  The burger is such smaller then a originally burger place and it's $21!!!!"}
{"text":"For my birthday I chose Richmond Station for a tasting menu or as they like to call it \"let us cook for you\" experience.  The dishes are usually served family style but we had a lot of preferences and allergies. They were so accommodating to all our needs which included: a vegan, a nut allergy, a fungi allergy, and a strong aversion to beets. We were treated to six courses!

First course - sunchokes and cauliflower (vegan) - well cooked with crispy brown exterior and creamy center and beautifully plated but honestly one of the least memorable courses of the meal. 

Second course - pork buns - these were one of the specials of the night. Pretty tasty but considering we had done a food tour in Chinatown the day before with some of the best Chinese in Toronto including pork buns, these hardly compared. 

Third course - roasted carrots (modified vegan) - ah the humble carrot . . . y'all these were THE best carrots I've ever eaten. They were roasty and toasty and sweet and savory with puree (of more carrot) and seeds and tahini and feta (on the side). Just so good I can barely describe them. 

Fourth course - butternut squash ravioli (vegetarian) - these were a crowd favorite topped with a brown butter sauce and toasted almonds. 
The pasta was cooked to perfection and the filling was creamy and dreamy. The almonds added the perfect textural contrast.

Fifth course - filet - this was accompanied with a parsnip (I think) puree and roasted carrot. I had extra helpings of filet because my counterparts are more of medium-well girls rather than medium-well. 

Dessert - tea & chocolate (complete with birthday candle) and apple & cheddar (nut-free) - I don't like chocolate very much but the tea \"caviar\" and meringues were delightful as was the ice cream. The apple and cheddar dish was like a crumble and also very delicious. Who knew those two things went together. I mean I've had them on a charcuterie board but still who knew? 

Overall a great experience and I'd recommend for a special occasion or just a fancy Wednesday night lol"}
{"text":"Incredibly good. This place manages to transform very conventional dishes into extremely delicious and beautiful ones. The cocktails are also really good and the staff was very kind. No complaints. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I returned to Richmond Station after my first tasting menu experience here and it was very good.  This time we asked for the extended menu and it exceeded expectations.  Even with the sous chef in charge, everything worked so well.  Service, pacing, plating, atmosphere, tastes... It hit every moment I would observe to say this is THE best.  You want a incredible night? The chef table and tasting menu is your entry.

If you're looking for a write up of the place or atmosphere, please read my first review.  I've got 12 different dishes to cover in this review!  Yes, that's right... 12 different flavours are presented in the extended tasting menu and not a single misfire.  The starting chef menu is $65 per person and you can speak to them ahead of time to upgrade it to the extended one at $85 pp.  You can't go wrong with any choice.

I do have to mention the service and pacing was far better this time.   Last time they weren't great on it.  This time, we got a wonderful and friendly staff who was easily to talk to, attentive, and just really friendly.  She gently observed finished dishes and swiftly moved dishes.  Also, the kitchen was very good on presenting the 12 dishes with minimal waits between each.   Excellent this time around.

Chef Menu (CM) 1: Beef Tartare.  What a first bite!  Super crispy thinly layered potatoes that act like a phyllo pastry base that cradle a generous bite of super tender beef.  Flavour highlights include bold horseradish to give it a bite and fresh dill to perk it up.  Loved this.  I need more potatoes like that in my life.  5/5

CM 2: New Brunswick oyster with champagne mignonette was up next.  Nicely shucked with no broken shell pieces.  The dash of chives gave it a nice savoury taste that complimented the briny delicious oyster.  The oyster was plump and had a mild metallic note.  4.5/5

CM 3: Maple Cured Trout.  I normally do not like bagels but this changed my opinion. We were given a maple cured trout on a tender buttered bagel and topped with everything spice and fresh dill.  It is so hard describe how delicious this was. The sharp fresh dill, the creamy and lightly sour creme fraiche, the rich meaty trout that has a nice rounded sweet maple note, and the bold hits of the everything spice & dill... and all piled on top of a buttery tender bagel piece.  Best bagel bite in a long long time.  5/5

CM 4: Pork terrine.  This was beautifully plated with flowers, leaves, and dollops of mustard & sauces.  It took 2 days to make and you can just see the meaty and rich pieces of pork in the terrine.  You got to scoop up the pork and smear it across the great crispy bread they serve here.  The mustard was the nice heat and flavour burst to cut through the rich pork.  5/5

CM 5: Chilled Asparagus soup.  Loved the vibrant green burst of colour and lovely plating.  This was really rich & creamy ... tasted like spring.  The addition of the toasted hazelnuts added a great crunch and nice deep nutty note to the light flavours.  5/5

CM 6: Farmers ricotta on toasted focaccia.  A light dish that showcased how good fresh cheese can taste.  The texture reminded more of a very smooth buttery French style omelette curds.  None of the dry crumbly texture of store bought ricotta.  The cracked fresh pepper was a nice flavour balance to the creaminess.  4.5/5

CM 7: Black Cod.  I've learned Richmond knows how to cook white fish really well.  This was seared to get a nice crisp edge but under the bronze crust was a super tender, juicy, and soft white delicate meat of the fish.  The tomato confit was a bit strong but it was a nice flavour addition to an otherwise light flavour.  4.5/5

CM 8: Pan seared Duck ... just wow.  The deep ruby meat was tender, deeply flavoured, and juicy. Extra crispy crust was a nice textural contrast.  Umami rich farro risotto and mushrooms made this a standout.  Generous portions too. 5+/5

CM 9: Richmond Burger ... beefy, juicy, and a great reason to lick everything off your fingers.  I drooled over this last time and continue to do so this time.  One of the few times I'm willing to eat burgers.  5/5

CM 10: Basil & olive oil ice cream, aerated sweet goat cheese, and graham soil.  What an creative dessert to combine bright herbal flavours and sweet.  I found this to be really refreshing and light.  I didnt taste the olive oil but it just added a textural richness to the sweet green flavours. Graham soil was the nice crunch to it. 4.5/5

CM 11 - Rhubarb pearls and gelee foam on top of sourdough ganache, earl grey white chocolate twigs, and sweet rye crumbs.  I loved this dessert.  It wasn't overly sweet as it used the tart flavourful rhubarb in bursts of the pearls and foam.  You had everything in this... crunchy, creamy, smooth, and airy with all the right touches. 5/5

CM 12 - Petit Four. Olive oil macaron, brûlée marshmallow, fudge, and earl grey meringue.  Sweet ending to a phenomenal meal

TLDR: My absolutely favourite meal in Toronto.  What are you waiting for? GO!"}
{"text":"So originally my boyfriend and I were booked to go to the Chase for Winterlicious, but unfortunately the fire alarm went off right after we got seated. How lucky eh? Not knowing when the alarm would stop, we decided to leave and luckily Richmond Station, around the corner, just had an opening for 2 people at the bar. Guess we lucked out here instead considering they are always booked up way in advance :)

Steak Tartar ($11)
LOVED THIS! the steak tartar was flavorful, and I love how it was served on a ruffles potato chip! Super tasty.

Cod Cakes ($10)
4 pieces of fried cod cakes. I liked how there was a lot of cod meat, not just stuffed with dough. It was fried nice and crispy, and went well with the sauce.

Pork Wellington ($27)
I've never heard/had pork wellington before, usually it's just beef wellington. This dish was on their daily specials menu. it's a porkloin, wrapped in diced mushroom, wrapped in a piece of cabbage, wrapped in a sausage, and finally wrapped in a puff pastry. The meat was tender, and I loved all 5 layers. Guess I was too greedy thinking they would serve the whole roll - they only serve a chunk from the middle. Under the pork wellington were mashed potatoes, roasted carrots and cabbage as the side.

Pulled Pork Ravioli ($25)
There were 6 pieces of Ravioli. The ravioli was stuffed with a lot of pulled pork, which was great but i found the meat not as tender. The ravioli was served in romesco sauce, sauteed kale, lime leeks, parmesan, cilantro, and almonds. I personally thought the taste of the pulled pork meat in the ravioli did not go well with the romesco sauce. But the sauce alone, tasted great with the kale and other side ingredients.

The service was really good - our waitress was amazing, she was very knowledgeable about the menu and ingredients, friendly and observant on noticing what we needed. 
Apparently they get a lot of locals so they change up their menu quite often. I'll be sure to come back and try their other menu items :)"}
{"text":"My hotel recommended this place as I could walk to it. Boy, did they get it right. This place was fantastic! I started with the Charcuterie, a combo of curried meats that had been done completely in house. The summer sausage of veal was truly heavenly.  I would not have ordered the mushroom and brussels sprout salad if it wasn't for my friendly and attentive bartender/server. I'm so happy she talked me into it, it was outstanding. 

I had the special, beef duo based on in house processed beef. Well done chef, you are certainly worthy of your accolades. Then I had the dessert feature that was cornucopia of refreshing flavors that sent me to food heaven. 

Love this place, I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great food and very nice location. A bit on the pricey side so if you are expecting quantity for your money, this place isn't it. But if you want good cuisine, reputable options, and a dinner on the quieter side, this place is for you."}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday early evening with my boyfriend and it was quite busy, but we were able to get seats at the bar in 15 mins! We both had the Station Burger with fries, oysters, and draft beer. The burger was great- although smaller in size in comparison to most places (and for the price), the burger and fries were quite filling and delicious. We loved the aioli sauce! The oysters were very fresh and toppings plenty, and the beer was great too. The service was also impeccable- the staff were very kind to us. Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"This restaurant gets a solid 4 start rating.

I can't bring myself to give it a 5 only because the tables are extremely close together, I'm talking less than a foot of space between the tables. It's really crowded in there for the size of the place, so I had to reluctantly deduct a star.

As for the food, it is really good. They have a small menu but feature daily specials. Although people may not like the restaurant because of their \"foo foo food\" mentality, I like good food in limited quantity if the flavour is there. And it was. I had the daily special beef duo, which was some sirloin steak and a pot roast. Although the pot roast was nothing mind blowing, all the sauces/fixings/accompanyments that came with the dish were amazing. I also tried the Sea Bream which if that was my own dish, I probably wouldn't have as many good things to say about this place.

Tried the lobster bisque and the charcuterie board for an appetizer. Both really good. I really enjoyed whatever mixture of oil and vinegar dip that came with the bread.

If you like trying hand crafted, well prepared dishes with tons of flavours and are ok with not a lot of food on your plate, definitely check this out"}
{"text":"Heard very good things about this restaurant so I went with 3 friends on a Saturday night for a late dinner at 10:15. We had reservations for 2 but they were able to accommodate a last minute change for 4 people. We just had to wait an extra 10 minutes which wasn't a big deal. The restaurant itself was nice like somewhere you could go have a nice dinner with friends or have an intimate date. I ordered the Eurobass Grenobloise and my boyfriend had the station. The Eurobass was super moist and flavourful and had a nice crisp from the skin. Everything was cooked perfectly and the flavours meshed really well together! My boyfriend's burger was cooked medium rare which was how it was recommended. It was a lot smaller than a normal burger, especially with a guy's appetite. The burger itself though was amazing! It was soft and cooked to perfection! The rosemary fries were equally as good! If only there were more of it! All in all a wonderful night!"}
{"text":"Took my husband here for the chef's table for Father's Day. It was decent. We had a cocktail before and then a wine pairing with each course. Pours were super small. We both could have driven home after - who says that after doing a chiefs table with wine pairings?! Not usually us lol. The kitchen view was awesome (I need to salt my steaks a whole lot more than what I am!). Kitchen staff also lovely. Food was delish but nothing I felt like I need to come again and experience."}
{"text":"I told the hotel concierge I wanted a good burger and she sent me here. Best burger I've had in years."}
{"text":"I've been to Richmond Station several times and never had issues.  I like the fact that they switch their menus frequently with unique idea. I felt that I had to write a review for my visit this time around. My friend I wanted to book a place where there's good food and we can talk. We're both celebrating some special stuff going on in our lives and I thought we should treat ourselves.  My friend got the oyster to start then. We both had the mushroom soup.  The soup was quite tasty.  We both ordered the duo duck.  We both agreed the duck was dry and very salty. We didn't like it.  The dessert we had was milk and tea.  Interesting mix not sure if I liked it.  Besides the duck food was not bad not great. What brought the rating so low to a 1 start was this time around the food was ok but the service was pretty bad.  Food is important but service to me is rated quite high as well. After every course the waitress was constantly rushing us. My friend is a slow eater so every time she stop to talk either our waitress or the restaurants wait staff would be there to try to take her plate away. It was so ridiculous that it go to the point where she can't put down her cutlery in fear of someone taking her plate away.  What brought it over the edge was when after we ordered dessert one of the restaurant wait staff came over to tell us they have someone waiting for our table and we had 15 mins to finished our dessert.  It was so unprofessional something you would expect from a bar or pub not a place where we paid $30 for an entree. So we rushed through our dessert and as soon as we finished our dessert the staff was there to clear our table. Seriously you can't possibly rush people if you're charging so much for the food. Why would you make reservations in 2 hours increments??! Ridiculous! This completely ruin our night.  I would not come back or recommend this restaurant which is quite disappointing since it's my go to place for all my client lunches.   Richmond Station just lost one of their loyal customer due to their rude service!"}
{"text":"This place is plain fantastic.  The food is excellent.  The ambiance is hip yet relaxed.  The prices are reasonable and the service is good.  

Charcuterie appetizer ($16) was excellent, especially the Culatello and the summer sausage.  The quinoa salad over soybean hummus ($10) was exceptionally tasty, with lots of different ingredients, and nice acidity.  The smoked trout ($26) was beautifully smoked and cooked perfectly.  The sirloin steak special ($28) was exceptionally well executed with lots of flavour.  All the garnishes were spot on.  The cheese plate dessert ($12) was also nice.  A bottle of Lobetia Tempranillo was reasonably priced at $45.

The highlight of the restaurant is the open kitchen right next to the dining room (on the upper floor.)  There are seats overlooking directly into the kitchen, if you wish to see the show, or interact with the chefs.  The kitchen is clean, busy, efficient, and QUIET.  When we were there, celebrity executive chef Carl Heinrich (winner of Top Chef Canada, season 2) was in the kitchen cooking up a storm shoulder-to-shoulder with the other young and energetic chefs.

My only minor complaint is that the dishes are a little bit on the small size.  But then again, the prices are quite reasonable.  This is one of my favourite new discoveries in the city."}
{"text":"Nice people and a nice decor that almost looks like a regular house in the top floor. Based on all the other reviews, I think we didn't go the right night there though as the food was just okay...

Nothing was really memorable from starters to desserts."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with Richmond Station. I've been here too many times to count, both for dinner and lunch with my husband, parents, coworkers and friends. The food here is absolutely awesome, and fairly priced. My all-time favourite dish on the menu is the Station Burger. From the milk bun, house made pickles and rosemary fries, it is to die for. I love that the burger patty has brisket in it. 

For my husband's 25th birthday, we sat at the Chef's Table and did the tasting menu with the wine tasting. Total, we paid over $300 with tip, which is not bad, considering the portions were fairly large. We were STUFFED by the end. The food was to die for, and the pairings were so much fun. We had an oyster with pommes kennedy, duck pate with sour cherries, a take on a caesar salad with a pork croquette, a potato croquette dish, trout with gnocchi and pureed butternut squash, pork done multiple ways and then dessert. The drink pairings were not all wine either - we started with a caesar and then a fun cider, which wasn't super sweet. 

I really can't recommend Richmond Station enough. The desserts are killer too. They may seem a bit odd and mismatched, but once you taste the deconstructed elements together, you won't be able to eat here without ordering a dessert! The one thing I will say is that the service can sometimes be a bit standoff-ish, but the service we received when we sat at the Chef's table was excellent."}
{"text":"Best of its kind! Likely among the first to get a Michelin star when they do come to Canada.

While everything was perfectly cooked and presented, their desert is absolutely amazing. We tried the \"popcorn\" and their interpretation of piña colada. Just try it once and you'll come back for more.

I would give this 6 stars if I had the option :)"}
{"text":"6/24/15: One of the best meals we had during our whole week-long vacation in Canada!  The waitress was really nice to us, and the food was very good!  The restaurant had a great vibe, and the ambiance was warm and modern.  Prices are somewhat modest too for a high-end restaurant.  If I lived around here, I'd totally be a regular!

1. Stn. Sparkler C$11:  Sorry can't remember remember details, but it certainly was good.

2. Niagara Ice (2 oz) C$13:  Was refreshing and sweet, but again can't remember details.

3. Bread:  Good French artisan bread with perfect texture.  If I remember correctly, the dipping sauce was different, perhaps apple cider vinegar with olive oil?  It was good.  Bonus points for doing something different.  8.5/10.

4. Digby Scallop Crudo C$13:  Scallops were fresh and the plate was beautiful.  Nice crunchy nuts for textural counterpoint.  8/10.

5. Lamb Neck Croquettes C$13:  Mmmm..... who doesn't like a good neck!?!?  Unfortunately the puree was a bit strong and overpowering.  It was a bit hard to taste the lamb flavor.  Also, why use a cast-iron pan to serve a cold dish?--odd.  5/10.

6. Slow-Cooked Rockfish C$25:  Perfectly cooked fish.  Typically you see rockfish in the better Chinese seafood restaurants where they are kept live in the tanks, visible to all.  But I've never seen this in a Caucasian restaurant.  Everything on the plate was delectable!  The title is a bit strange though cause it's obvious this fish wasn't stewed for very long, else it would not have such a delicate texture and flavor.  We did ask the waitress to explain the discrepancy, and I kinda recall a somewhat complicated process that might have involved sous vide.  So hence the \"slow-cooked\" part.  Anyway, whatever they did it was great.  9/10.

7. Stn. Burger C$21:  So I am not sure, but at another Canadian restaurant it was explained to us that there's a law saying you can't serve burgers less than well-done?  I dunno, but they didn't ask us here how we wanted it... and definitely didn't need our help cause it was perfect!  Probably just about medium--very juicy.  So this burger is unlike any I've ever had--it's actually stuffed with pulled meat--I believe the waitress said short rib?  I think a standard high-end patty still tastes better, but perhaps this was their way of keeping it moist while still abiding by the law (if there is one)?  Bonus points for creativity.  Didn't like the chutney spread much though--a little too much sweetness for my burger.  It's not dessert after all, ha ha.  Anyway, overall was great.  8/10.

8. The Acid Test C$9:  YOU MUST GET THIS.  It's like a candy store melted down and condensed into a plate!  So many colors.  So many toys for your tongue!  It's like a kaleidoscope you eat!  Fruity, sweet, syrupy, crunchy, completely mesmerizing!  In America I've never had any dessert like this, but I'm starting to think this might be more of a thing in Canada since after this I actually had another similar dessert--but this one was the best!  One of the best desserts I've ever had!  Seriously.  10/10

9. Free Ice Cream:  I don't believe this is standard for them, but they had a special dessert that day using this ice cream, and perhaps since we came somewhat late they had some extra to give us?  It was totally delicious, and REALLY SPICY.  I loved it!--the super spiciness was awesome against the cold of the ice cream.  Great stuff!  (And even better it was a gift!)  10/10

10. Gift Chocolate with our check:  Can't remember the details, but I liked it.

Damn good meal.

5/5

{"text":"Elk tartare and duck breast were decent but the Station Burger was by far the best burger we've ever had. Finished off with their chocolate bar, which was a great treat!

Service was superb, though we did feel that our waiter favoured the table beside us, which had ordered more food, as they were provided complementary ice cream with their bill. Regardless, an excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"E xcellent scallops, just cooked to perfection. a must try item. burger was yummy. We ordered their special dessert on chalk board which was the rocky road brownie. It impressed us do much and  was too ready that we ordered another dessert on the menu. It was also very refreshing. We will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place. Food, atmosphere and servers were amazing. Cannot wait to come back.

Service, wait times, dress code
We came during a busy hour on a Saturday night at around 7 pm but only had to wait for about 5-10 minutes for a table. The restaurant is beautifully decorated; it's sort of sophisticated but casual at the same time. Our server was very knowledgeable and knew the menu inside out and gave us great recommendations. 

Food
Appetizers: 
We had one of their specials that day which was the chicken wings. Highly recommend it if you're a huge wings fan (which we totally are). It was very flavourful.

Mains:
STN burger
Honestly, it was probably the best burger I've ever had. The patty was so juicy and the sauces that accompanied it was pure perfection. I'd say the sauces had a bit of a sweet taste to it which contrasted well with the acidity from the beet chutney. The burger comes with rosemary fries which were also very deeelicious.

Pulled Pork Ravioli 
My boyfriend was very satisfied with his selection as well. The ravioli sauce was more on the light side which we love, compared to some that are usually very heavy and creamy. The stuffed pulled pork was great and overall the dish was great. 

Dessert:
Honey Poached Pear
A lovely dessert dish. Ice cream and the caramelized poached pear fit perfectly together."}
{"text":"Excellent food, amazing service! I had the roast leg of venison special. It's rare to find a place that can do a dish so well. It was tender and perfectly seated. The heirloom carrots and squash purée paired perfectly.

Dessert was equally amazing. The play on the pumpkin spice latte (PSL as they called it) was a perfect blend of earthy flavors and sweetness. The textures balanced each other for an overall perfect dish.

Definitely worth coming back to."}
{"text":"I would easily come back here if not for the burger but for the rhubarb lassi. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Amazing small interactions and food magic.  I sat alone at the bar, and found other intrepid travelers as well.  The gentleman to my left asked for the chef to make him a single course with mushrooms.  He got magic on a plate.  I asked if there was an off menu dessert, and with a twinkle in the staffs' eyes got a small something amazing that they were testing for Restaurant Week.  The gentleman on the other side of me got a blend of five plates.  All were fabulous.  I will be back next time I visit Toronto!"}
{"text":"I wish they had half stars...Because a 4 just isn't good enough of a rating for this restaurant. I rarely give 5 ratings, and would only do so if I've visited a restaurant at least 3 times, eating something different each time. So, since this is my 2nd visit, I'll rate it a 4.5

Both times had a few oysters on the half shell. Now, you may think a Village Bay is a Village Bay, but for some reason, these particular VBs were simply melt-in-your-mouth delicious, with just the right amount of chew and salty sea finish. Over far to fast.

Roasted beet salad was a devine and perfectly proportionate blend of salad greens, beets, candied hazelnuts and whipped goat cheese. The slivers of root veg added the perfect amount of crunch. I thought I had this the first time as well, but this time much more memorable.

First time around I had the lobster tempura cocktail. Found it quite bland actually. It made me realize that lobster should be enjoyed in it's purest essence, not battered and deep fried. Same reason why I never enjoy lobster ravioli.

Charcuterie was good, albeit a bit boring. Terroni's charcuterie is still my fave.

Second time around I had the polenta fries. This is a dish that I will be thinking about tomorrow, and the day after, and will at some point in the near future make  special trip just to order take out. What's wrong with deep fried corn muffin anyway? (referring to another Yelp comment). Loved the spicy mayo accompaniment and anything with a sprig of cilantro will win my tongue over any time.

The burger is delicious. The combo of beef and short rib, spiked with the chutney, is a unique and refreshing spin on a standard burg. Great fries as others have noted.

Lastly, can't go without mentioning...while I didn't have dessert either time, there is excellent eye candy all round. ;-)"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night without a reservation to meet my old roommate from decades ago who has since moved to the U.K. like everyone else in my life. He was here on business and had to leave for the airport so we only had an hour to catch up. 

We chose the communal table which seems to be a free for all and were wedged between strangers, a couple on my left and a gaggle of ladies armed with forks, sharing seemingly endless plates of food on the right. I love this kind of set up. This is how orgies begin. If he didn't have to get to Pearson, I could have totally seen the evening turn out completely different instead of me riding a streetcar home alone, tearfully holdling in my gastro-explosives because I always forget just how lactose intolerant I am (but fuck me, that dessert was worth the incendiary dutch oven under the sheets that night, more on that later....the dessert I mean, not the flatuspalooza).

I wasn't sure what to order because he called me out of the blue, and I am a broke bitch and the food here is expensive, so I was all kind of shy about it, but he took over and ordered the wine. It kind of became obvious he was going to pay, so I let him order an appetizer, a special which was 4 bite sized bricks of  panko-coated cheese from Prince Edward County. Holy deliciousness, it was heavenly. I kept thinking how good it would be if it was on a burger, which is what the gentleman next to me was chowing down on. Based on his face while he was eating it, I would say he was probably really good at cunnilingus. If I'm lucky enough to find a date on OkCupid who isn't a goddamn vegetarian, I will take him here and suggest he have this meaty-ass burger just to see how he handled it. And btw, what is going on these days with dudes and their eating habits on these sites? FYI you're not a \"pescetarian\" if you put pepperoni on your pizza, just because the cow wades in water.

Our server, who was adorable, told us about the specials of the day and he kind of lingered over the chicken catchetori (I'm not going to bother to look up the spelling, I'm too lazy and you know what I mean) which was over a bed of creamy polenta. Fuck me and cream, we are mortal enemies and yet it gives me such hard rugged lady wood that I keep forgetting my delicate intestines. I ordered it because consequences are for pussies. My friend ordered something off the regular menu which was lamb merguez oriechhette (again spelling, fuck it, the pasta that looks like fetus ears).

My chicken cacciatore (nailed it!) was amazing. It had a HINT of rosemary in it. You know how rosemary can overpower everything when used incorrectly? it's like who ever thought to put an herb that looks like a Christmas tree in cuisine? And gross, soapy taste, ugh so 90s retro from that Silver Palate cookbook where they dumped it in everything. That used to be how I thought, now I am converted. They probably use a sprig, then take it out so it's aromatic presence is \"just so.\"

My friend's pasta was a lunch bag let down though and the only reason I'm not giving this joint 5 stars. I felt really bad because a) ear pasta is ugly as fuck b) there was hardly any meat in it! The lamb merguez looked like a few tiny bacon bits sprinkled over top. I would have cried if I had ordered it. He liked it enough but we both thought mine was way better, obvi. I let him eat some of my delicious chicken meat but kept the creamy polenta to myself, it was soooooooo good. 

We ordered a chocolate pudding dessert, which came served up as a hot mess on a plate, all blobbed any which way, with a dollop of ice cream and a sprig of basil. If I was judging this faecal looking monstrosity on looks alone, I would have flushed it down the toilet  before checking it for worms. BUT! It was so delicious. And probably what did me in on the streetcar but whatevs, one has to live. IT WAS WORTH EVERY BITE. Perfection. 

We were in and out in under an hour, they graciously called my friend a cab and off he went into the wind and over the ocean. My rumbling stomach reminded me of when we were roommates we used to watch tv and drink Diet Coke, pull each other's fingers, and have wicked belching contests. As I lacto-intolerantly farted my way home on the streetcar, I got kind of nostalgic thinking that maybe he was my one that got away. SIGH."}
{"text":"You must try the burger!!!! It's so damn good. It looks fairly small but it truly is what's on the inside that counts. I wasn't able to finish off the generous serving of fries that it came with. At $22, it's totally worth it. 

I went there for a bachelorette dinner of 10 girls. And super kudos to Richmond Station, they were THE ONLY restaurant that didn't impose some ridiculous restriction like 55/pp family meal with a 500$ non refundable deposit. 

That's why they're getting 5 stars. Good job!"}
{"text":"One of our favourite places in TO. Beautifully created dishes with amazing flavours. We tried dinner twice once off the regular menu and the second time we tried chef tasting menu. Would highly recommend this place to any foodies out there who have yet to try one of the Toronto's best restaurants!"}
{"text":"The good 
-The menu seemed quite limited upon first glance, but I find that this way, they are better able to deliver on quality and perfect their dishes. Some menu items seem fairly simple (pierogies) but they are executed well, nevermind that they are the most expensive pierogies I've eaten to date. Flavours and sauces are bold, but not overly salty or sweet. Their deconstructed desserts (we ordered the PB&J) are very interesting and worth a try, even if you're too full to fit it in.

The bad 
- our server wasn't very attentive...she took forever to get drinks, take orders, serve food, not offering us bread and ruining my friends birthday surprise. We got to the resto at 815 and didn't get our mains until 930! I did notice other servers at the other tables and I think she may have been an exception. But for a restaurant such as this, I expected more consistency with the service. 
-Wine prices were quite steep 
-Dinner reservations, they seem to only take resos for 530 or 8

Overall, I would recommend this restaurant as the food stands up to the reviews."}
{"text":"Highlights:
-Loved the trout, it was light but very flavorful. Served with beets and potatoes
-Tartare was delicious, shared with the table, seasoned well
-Folks loved their dishes and we cleaned up! Burger was cooked to desired level, scallops were a special, mushroom ravioli, not many complaints with their dishes
-Seated close to the bar at the front of the restaurant. Good energy

Lowlights:
-Polenta fries were a little skimpy. There were only 5 to share between the 4 of us. It would have been nice if the Server mentioned that so we could have ordered a diff app or changed it
-Dessert menu was not very appealing so we passed on that"}
{"text":"I don't often think of perusing the financial district to minimize my hanger, but after a long day of walking the madness set in fast and my partner and I needed to find a solution STAT! 

Enter Richmond Station... we showed up just past 7pm with no reservations. The place was packed but the hostess managed to find us a seat at the bar. I should note that they do take reservations so they are highly recommended. 

The service was prompt though from the bar it's hard to see their specials on the board and our waiter failed to mention them as we ordered (that being said I have no regrets on what I ordered). 

First I got the Peking duck pancakes, which were more like 4 small thin savoury crapes stuffed with duck toasted peanuts, kimchi, and hoisin. It was quite delicious but I was expecting more of a fluffy pancake or bun. The taste was similar to 3030's steamed bun with duck which is great because I miss that menu item.

Next I got the brown butter poached halibut. Fish is not something I tend to order at restaurants outside the Maritime but the promise of delicious spaetzle drew me in. The fish was cooked to perfection and the entire dish just blended together perfectly."}
{"text":"An absolutely fantastic meal from start to finish. The chickpea fritters will be salted by the tears of joy flowing unstoppably from my eyes. The sea bream ceviche will make you reconsider life itself. The skate wing with crispy potatoes and asparagus tips is a meal so expertly crafted and subtly complementary that I watched myself eat it from a height of about six feet above my body. Possibly the best meal I have ever eaten in Toronto, and definitely the best cappuccino I've ever had at a subway-themed restaurant."}
{"text":"Everything great!! Service, atmosphere, cocktails and, of course, food. Did not want to leave. If in Toronto, you must go."}
{"text":"I wanted to go five-stars, I really did. A lot of things about this place are five-worthy. The location is spectacular, though not where you'd necessarily expect to find the best food in Toronto; it's not  in a bouzhy upscale culinary hub, to say the least.

The aesthetic is contemporary and modern, yet classy and understated. The servers are dressed sharp, traditional yet updated.

The food was delicious, though if I compare it to the best of the best places I've eaten in the world; it didn't quite hit that level... the level where you close your eyes and exhale deeply. Don't get me wrong, it was quite good. The samosas were light and crunchy, the polenta fries were savory and delicious. My pasta dish was world-class. My date's entree was quite delish as well.

But somehow, while I almost rounded-up to five stars, I just didn't. If you've been to Animal in Los Angeles or Son of a Gun in, well, also Los Angeles, you know that the bar is set super-high for me. Richmond Station was excellent, but A excellent for me and not A+."}
{"text":"Decided to drop by Richmond Station without a reservation during a weekday lunch hour, not a good idea. The restaurant was full and not even a seat as at the bar for a single diner like me. The hostess suggested that I come back in 15 minute or so which I did and luckily a lot of people left to go back to work. 

Lunch Prix Menu $19 + $5 for dessert for this afternoon:

Quinoa Salad
- good flavour and refreshing

Southern Fried Chicken with Ranch Dressing Salad
- quite juicy but the batter tasted rather bland and boring

Frozen Yogurt - dulce de leehe, chocolate, smashed raspberries and maldon salt
- great combination of texture and flavour. Salty, Sweet and Tart at the same time...
- Dessert saved my lunch!

Service is quite attentive and my server is really knowledgeable with the menu.

I think I need to come back again for dinner then I can update my review. Lunch experience was just so so for me."}
{"text":"Absolutely unreal experience every time I go here! The owner is so approachable and really cares. The food is wonderful, lots of choices on drinks and the service is always impeccable. 

I've been 4 times in the last year, and they have a great bar seat right in front of kitchen where you can watch food being prepared. The oysters are delicious (not grainy in the least), and the burger is to die for. We had some sort of wicked peanut butter dessert bar and that was great too. The ambiance is the best- good lighting, unpretentious, but elegant. 

They are so good that I would suggest reserving at least a week in advance if you want an evening table."}
{"text":"Richmond Station is a surprisingly cool and hip restaurant located near the Eaton Centre which is a perfect mixture of casual, trendy, and classy. The restaurant has kind of a lofty feel with very high ceilings, but is brightly lit. They have some smaller tables which can fit groups of two to four people, but also one large communal table in the middle, which is kind of interesting. The purse hooks under the table are a convenient touch, although sometimes can be a bit bothersome as I found I ended up kicking my bag a lot of the time.

My friends and I chose not to partake in the tasting menu this time, so we selected our own dishes. We shared the polenta fries which we ordered based on reading rave Yelp reviews. Honestly though, I wasn't that impressed with these and likely would not order them again. The dish came with about 8... or maybe even less, 6... (?) fries, which was a bit sad. Granted, each fry is fairly thick, and the dish was pretty good, well seasoned, etc., but I still didn't think it was worth it for the tiny portion we got. 

For my main I got the pan seared brown trout, which I quite enjoyed. It came with lemon marmalade, green beans, almonds and potatoes. The fish was very soft and moist which I liked, and I particularly enjoyed the zest from the lemon marmalade. 

All of their desserts here looked so interesting, so of course my friends and I all had to try. I ended up getting the Japanese cheesecake and thoroughly enjoyed it for all its uniqueness! It had wasabi rice pearls, apple, matcha ice cream, ginger, and vanilla-soy anglaise. The cheesecake part was really soft and not so much creamy like a New York cheesecake, but spongier the way a Japanese cheesecake should be. Everything about this dish was very light in flavour and not too sweet, which was perfect for me. The wasabi rice pearls added a unique texture and crunch to the dessert, and were probably my favourite component with the exception of the actual cheesecake. There wasn't really a strong wasabi flavour though, but I didn't mind. I sampled a bit of the sea buckthorn posset and the red velvet cake which was the special of the day, but I liked the cheesecake the most - would recommend it for sure!

Although I would complain that their menu is a little bit small, I think the restaurant regularly changes it up because some items mentioned by other reviewers were not on the menu I saw. My first experience at this restaurant was a positive one, and left me intrigued and interested to try their tasting menu in the future!"}
{"text":"Great food! Burger is a must have. The best burger I've had in Toronto! Sala, all the specials, and scallop is also really good. Service was also exceptional every time we went there."}
{"text":"I had a really weird experience at Richmond Station.

Friends were in town for a company off-site so we stopped in here for cocktails and appetizers.

They did that thing where they made a big fuss about us arriving without a reservation in the middle of a weekday. The whole place was empty when we arrived. It was still empty when we left.

The food was fantastic. The cocktails were fantastic. The service was awful.

They seated us in the back and made it very clear that we had to leave soon because the table was reserved. Seemed fine at first, but it was a 4-top and we were in a sea of empty 4-tops, even when we left.

This is clearly a business dress sort of place. They were practically hyperventilating that my friend was wearing (gasp) shorts and we had t-shirts on. With visible tattoos. Cover the eyes of the children.

I defend Toronto as a start-up hub, but experiences like this prove me wrong. Don't bother if you're not wearing a tie or they might make you eat in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Richmond Station is an upscale farm-to-table restaurant offering Canadian dishes using fresh ingredients. It is helmed by the winner of Top Chef Canada (Season 2), Chef Carl Heinrich, who opened the restaurant in late 2012. As you walk into the restaurant; there is a chalkboard to the left displaying the specials for the night. The specials for that Tuesday were Honey Glazed Duck Breast $$27) and Braised Rabbit Pappardelle ($25).

The restaurant was modern, and simply decorated with wooden accent furnishing and a high ceiling. There are two dining areas; one in the front and as you walk up the steps, there is another dining area in the back. We were seated in the back area which I enjoyed, as the space had a view of the open kitchen.

We started off with an order of 6 pieces of oysters on the half shell ($3.50 a piece) [house condiments, horseradish, lemon]. The oysters were absolutely fresh  and the provided condiments added extra spices to them. The scallion polenta fries ($8) were served on a rectangular serving board glazed with truffle aioli, Asiago cheese, and chives. I heard a lot of great reviews from friends so I had to order it to see for myself. I loved it as the polenta fries had a very crispy exterior, yet really soft on the inside. I highly recommend getting this this as a starter. 

For my main course, I opted for the Station Burger ($20). I would have to say that the quality of the burger was excellent. The braised short rib was served medium rare on topped of a fresh milk bun, and was really juicy. There was a lot of flavor in the burger; thanks to the beet chutney. Additionally, the burger was dressed with lettuce, lettuce, beet chutney, and aged cheddar which, and served with a side of rosemary fries. The accompanied fries were pretty decent, but a couple of pieces were really hard.

Overall, I enjoyed my dinner at Richmond Station. The dimly lit restaurant provides a casual ambiance without pretentiousness. It's perfect for either dinner with family, friends, or even for dates. Reservations are highly recommended for dinner though; unless you don't mind the wait."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto for a week, and being completely unsure where to eat, I chose to consult what has become my favorite travel app....Richmond Station popped up close to my hotel and highly recommended. I was not disappointed.

My favorite dish of the night was the Cajun Halibut Cakes, which is saying a lot because I hate fish. Why did I order fish if I hate it? Because I know it's recommended to eat fish once in a while, so I occasionally try different recipes hoping to discover something I can tolerate.

Richmond Station's Cajun Halibut Cakes were listed as a shareable appetizer and had a very appealing set of ingredients. They arrived as 4 small cakes in an attractive arrangement. The flavor was robust but not overwhelming, and with only a hint of a fish taste. I highly recommend them.

The main course was a beef ravioli, which was also very good.

The restaurant is not very distinct from the street, but I think that added to the feeling that you found someplace unique. The inside had a warm inviting feeling. The staff was very helpful and friendly.

Enjoy.....I did!"}
{"text":"Richmond Station has a nice atmosphere and very friendly staff. The only downside is that you need to make a reservation about 2 months in advance or so to get a good spot. As far as food goes, the appetizers are better than the mains. My girlfriend and I tried it out one time and the next time we went back we decided just to get all the appetizers which turned out to be the better choice."}
{"text":"Super charming and knowledgable service. Extremely difficult to choose amongst the intriguing menu choices. Thankfully they have a appetizer tasting option.When the food came out it was as good as the previous reviews had promised. Really enjoyed the duck, polenta fries and tartar. All around a great dining experience."}
{"text":"BF and I came for a birthday celebration. We were impressed with the ambiance, the service and the food.  BF ordered a Hushpuppies app and a Rainbow Trout entree, and I ordered a Brassica Caesar salad and a Eurobass entree.  The Eurobass was a replacement of skate wing on the regular menu, but it was cooked the same way. 

The Brassica Caesar was in reality a complicated slaw and nut salad with a light Caesar dressing.  It was a refreshing take on Caesar salad.  Just bear in mind you won't be getting romaine lettuce and creamy Caesar dressing with this interpretation. 

The Hushpuppies tasted all right. It was a heavy app for solo consumption.  It is best shared.

The Eurobass filet was moist and big portioned.  It was dressed with a flavourful creamy sauce. There were too many ingredients to count. They added \"pops\" of contrasting flavours and many layers of textures to the dish.  I liked the complexity of this dish. If Eurobass is available on your visit, I highly recommend you to order it.

The Rainbow Trout was also dressed in a creamy sauce.  I found the trout lean.  

We ordered a London Fog dessert from the evening's specials. The chef must love to play with texture, because it was an indulgent play on texture. It tasted very good. You have to like texture play to appreciate it. One thing for sure: you won't see it anywhere else."}
{"text":"I had tried their regular menu and the tasting menu with wine pairing. No disappointment every time we visit. Must call a week ahead for reservation, this place is popular!!"}
{"text":"We sat at the chef's table, which is actually more of a bar counter style setup, and enjoyed the experience of seeing the chefs in action. I think it's worth the trade off of less spacious table space and it's something you should do at least once eating here.

As for the food...  I'm not sure if it was just an off night or just the food here isn't to my taste. We got the polenta fries, mushroom agnolotti and duck liver pate all of which I've seen many recommendations on here for. Everything was just okay. The polenta fries were simple in taste, but unique I guess. It seemed too salty and one dimensional in flavour. The duck liver pate was better, but I've had better pate at other restaurants. Lastly, the mushroom agnolotti was super-flavour packed to the point of being way too salty at parts and also quite oily. I did like the mushrooms around the agnolotti, but the agnolotti itself wasn't my thing. Again, maybe it was just an off night or I had some bad picks. The presentation of all the dishes was very well done though I have to say.

On the upside, the service was very quick and friendly, and the atmosphere is good for a date night yet not too snooty."}
{"text":"really great experience.  I highly recommend the tasting menu. The oysters were amazing! Every course was really well prepared. Unique flavours and combinations."}
{"text":"Exactly what I was looking for.  Visiting Toronto and was looking for good food in a casual atmosphere.  Food was great. Casual place. Wine was good and beer too.

{"text":"I do have a vague memory of grabbing a meal at Richmond Station a while back and not being terribly impressed, but when someone suggested dinner, I was happy to give the place another shot.

I'm so glad I did.

We arrived around 5:30 on a Tuesday night and the place was packed. We were shown to a \"cozy\" table jammed between two other tables but it wasn't as oppressive as it could have been.

We decided to start with one of the specials, a Chicken Empanada. I can't remember exactly what was in there, but the predominant flavors were chicken and caramelized onions. On its own, it was a good but somewhat one-note concoction. Coupled with the accompanying spicy aioli, however, it became a somewhat addictive appetizer.

We also received a complimentary order of fresh bread to nibble on. The sourdough bread was delicious, but the oil for dipping was oddly sweet and a little off-putting.

For my main, I went with the Eurobass Grenobloise (\"squash puree, potato gnocchi, sundried tomatoes, artichokes, capers, pumpkin seeds\"). Now this was an all-around magnificent dish. The fish was cooked perfectly, while the various accoutrements were prepared and placed perfectly. (In particular, the soft gnocci and flavorful squash puree were fantastic.)

I should also point out that the service was amazing. Our waitress was extremely helpful and she was on top of things for the entirety of the above-average meal."}
{"text":"Thank you, Richmond station for providing an out-of-towner a simple and delicious dining experience. I am from Cleveland and took a trip to Toronto for my birthday. I wanted to go somewhere special and amazing for my birthday, but scrolling through the pages of Yelp made me exhausted. Clevelanders aren't the most adventurous types, so searching through the menus of some of Toronto's trendiest places made me squeamish of all the offerings of animal organs and elk. 
Entering Richmond station, I was met with a fancy, yet still casual interior. I didn't feel under-dressed and I felt welcomed. The special appetizer of the day was tempura sweet potato chips, and they were fabulous. I ordered the pierogi dish, while my SO ordered the beef duo. I couldn't find the slightest flaw in any of the dishes; all of the flavors worked perfectly together. I come from a town with a large Polish population, so having delicious pierogi away from home was a real treat."}
{"text":"Been here twice with my Toronto based co-workers (maybe one is a part owner and not teling me) - and left both times raving about the food.

This time the quinoa salad was pretty incredible - everyone agreed on that. And the burger is as good as everyone says - tender and flavorful and spicy in all the right ways.  Good selection of local beers, but they were out of a few when we went, much to the dismay of folks who have particular tastes. 

Not quite so over the top good that I feel like it deserves 5 stars, but I really enjoyed it. Would definitely go back, because the menu changes often and they try and practice the whole \"nose to tail\" cooking where they use all the parts of the animals they purchase - so you know you'll get something where the chef has put some thought into when to serve something and what to serve."}
{"text":"We saved this restaurant for our fancy dinner out, and it did not disappoint.  All the food from start to finish was interesting, unique, and flavorful.

Our server was very efficient and knowledgeable about the menu.  When we ordered the charcuterie to start, she asked if we wanted to add cheese to it, since it was just meat. Of course we did (who can eat one without the other?) but you are officially forewarned - that actually made it double the price. I loved that the server who ran the meat and cheese platter out did a complete rundown of everything we would be eating, and gave recommendations for what combined well with other items.

The menu is not large, but there is quite a variety to choose from.  I chose the rabbit 2 ways, and that day that meant it would be the shoulder fried, and the loin grilled.  I thought the shoulder had more flavor, but the loin was delicious as well. There were quite a few interesting items on my plate, but my other favorites were the crispy potato triangles.

Dessert was fabulous - I had their version of carrot cake.  It seemed like a spice cake, served with ice cream and topped with caramel.  Delicious.  They also offered soy options for their after-dinner latte, of which I am a big fan.

Richmond Station is a fun restaurant with a pleasing, industrial-chic atmosphere, and it is definitely worth a night out."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite and the best meal of my Toronto trip. I'm so proud of myself for finding this place. If you really want to know how I found this restaurant, it started with a question - what is Canadian cuisine?? Being in Canada for the first time, I wanted to have the best representation of Canadian food so I went through many websites and reviews and concluded this place as my worth it winner. 

As a good yelper, I did my homework and realized they have a secret chefs menu. It's 5-7 courses usually between $60-70 CAD. We opted for the chefs menu because it allowed as to try a little bit of everything on the regular menu. I won't go into detail about each course but the entire dinner experience lasted three hours, nine courses, and a bottle of red wine. The cost for the chef tasting menu - $65 CAD. OMG blew my mind because it was cheap/affordable and I had an unbelievably great time. 

To highlight some of the food I enjoyed the most - the charcuterie and the homemade bread (the bread was crack), the steak was well cooked, and of course the (TWO) desserts. I actually preferred the vibe here, very chill unlike typical fine dining. To answer my own question of what is Canadian cuisine, I think it is basically food you'll find in American or European countries. The ingredients are probably locally sourced. Anyways, I loved everything and will definitely recommend it to anyone!!"}

I was in Toronto for the first time, and I wanted to try some really fabulous Canadian cuisine. I was quite impressed with the food scene in Toronto and the number of great sounding options. Richmond Station caught my eye, and when I discovered that the owner had won Top Chef in Canada, it seemed like the perfect option.

We had a large group and were given a prix fixe menu, consisting of snacks for the table, a starter, a main, and a dessert. The snacks included Wild Leek Pierogi Croquettes, Duck Liver Pate, Beef Tartare, Mussels Escabache, and the Richmond Station Charcuterie small sampler. The croquettes had an amazing horseradish flavor throughout and were topped with scallions and pickled shallots. They were amazing. The pate was served on toasted brioche and topped with cherry mostarda. The pate was extremely smooth and creamy and was almost butter like. The pairing with the cherry was brilliant, and everyone who tried it, including folks who were initially a bit shy about duck liver, thought it was amazing. 

I am typically not a huge fan of beef tartare, but what they served was melt in your mouth good. It tasted like no beef tartare I have ever had. The mussels were a bit unique with a creole aioli, corn relish, and pickled jalapenos, giving them a tiny bite while expanding the flavor of the mussels in a way I hadn't tasted before. I will sound like a broken record, but man were they terrific, so fresh and full. Finally, the charcuterie sampler came out. It had a few veggies (e.g. pickled green beans and gold beets), cured salami, and rabbit rillette. I enjoyed the veggies I had, and the salami was good as well. The rabbit, however, stole the show. It had a fabulous flavor, melding a light sweetness with really tender meat. Overall, the snacks were pretty great.

There were 3 appetizers to choose from, and I went with the Pork Meatballs Marinara. The house meatballs were served atop cornbread croutons and spinach and were covered with marina, pine nuts, asiago, and chilies. The meatballs were incredibly tender, and the melding of all the ingredients in the plate was ingenious. The only complaint I might have is that it didn't last very long, but I sure did enjoy every bite while I ate them! I also split half a dozen of the tastiest oysters I have had in a long time. They were super fresh and full bodied with a nice sweet flavor. The oysters were accompanied with fresh shaved horseradish and a number of different sauces. I love horseradish, and it made the already delicious oysters taste even better. I could have easily eaten a dozen rather than just the 3 I had, but I knew I needed to save myself for the rest of the courses.

There were quite a few choices on the entrée portion, but they had a venison special that sounded too good, so I asked the waiter if there was any way for me to substitute that in as a main. He told me yes, and I was ecstatic when the plate was brought to the table. It consisted of a grilled venison leg, pre-sliced, cooked medium rare of course, atop a kallette & barley stew, and served with sunchokes, roasted carrot, and carrot salad. I also spied a few Brussel sprouts in the dish.  Stunning isn't a superlative enough word for this dish, as it was easily one of the best entrée and food combinations I have ever had. The venison was cooked perfectly and had a rich, robust flavor that set off fireworks in my mouth as it melted with each bite. The combination of the stew and carrot salad was amazing and quite refreshing, pairing with the venison like a twin. The rest of the accompaniments were also quite tasty, and it was obvious the chef had really thought through the ingredients and flavor profiles to craft an amazing dish.

I was pretty stuffed, but we still had dessert coming. I chose to go with the butter tart. It was made of a pecan raisin crust, cinnamon wafer, and brandy caramel, and served with apple sorbet. Admittedly it wasn't at all what I was expecting, but that was perfectly fine given how delicious it was. The sorbet had a cinnamon apple flavor profile and reminded me of real apple pie, if it were frozen of course. The dessert finished off the meal nicely, and I was truly stuffed.

Richmond Station is unassuming from the front and looks tiny on the inside, but it is deceptively large inside. It managed to mix a bit of trendy with casual, being a nice place without being pretentious. The service was very good and also quite helpful with various food questions. The food is pricey, and the portions themselves aren't massive, but in a multiple course format it does turn out to be quite filling, especially since the food tends to be quite rich. It is easy to see why Richmond Station is rated so highly as a restaurant, and I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of the experience. I will definitely plan on returning the next time I am in Toronto."}
{"text":"My second time here and it doesn't disappoint. The polenta fries are a must. And everything is available in half portions. They even have a tasting menu and seasonal specials. Leave space for dessert; it's always a work of art."}
{"text":"Fantastic little hide away in Downtown Toronto.  The service and food is fantastic.  The place is a lot of fun but you can still still carry on a conversation.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.
The lunch course was pretty good, and my wife got the trout and this dish was PHENOMENAL. 
We re foodies and not always easily pleased, but this was by far my best food experience in Toronto. Will come back anytime. Would even come back daily if I could. 
And it s very affordable for the quality."}
{"text":"Dining at Richmond Station was a wonderful experience. I tried the Beef Tartare, Grilled Swordfish, and Peanut Butter Vibe. The food was beautiful and delicious. The Beef Tartare was fresh, nicely seasoned, and topped with a small flavorful egg yolk. The Swordfish was meaty, flaky, and very flavorful. The veggies were fresh, tender, and perfectly grilled. Finally the Peanut Butter Vibe was decadent.  This was basically a peanut butter cream with chocolate pieces, peanut butter candy pieces, graham pieces, and raspberry sorbet. Yes, it was just as good as it sounds. If you plan to visit, get a reservation. We visited in the middle of the week around 6pm and were lucky to find a pair of seats at the bar. Others who came into the restaurant after us without a reservation weren't so fortunate. There is a lot of hype surrounding this restaurant and for good reason."}
{"text":"Most of you may already know alreay that I am a huge fan of Top Chef Canada and Season 2 winner Chef Carl Heinrich (@ChefHeinrich) finally open his own restaurant Richmond Station (@richmondstn) which have been in the making for quite a while now. Having met the chef himself before, he did drop by our table a couple time to say hi and ask how everything was (ahem, big crush on cute chef here ) 

The ceiling was high but the place was very narrow and from the front window looking in, I can't help but feel like I'm in a station. The Top Chef Canada champion have invested his prize money into this 3,000 square foot farm to table restaurant along with celebrity butcher, Ryan Donovan... both formally from Marben. The cuisine here is pretty rustic with a modern touch.

 A big fan of local wines, I'm glad that more than 80% of their wine list are from local wineries 
Ordered one of my favorite winery Norman Hardie 's Pinot Gris

 Polenta Fries $8
~ bomba mayonnaise, marinara
~Love love this polenta fries with the marinara sauce, although I usually like spicy I found the bomba mayo spicy but lack of the pop of flavor to compliment the polenta.
~ Crunchy inside with a grainy soft interior

 Richmond Station Charcuterie $14
~ selection of meats & preserves from the pantry
~Not sure if I remember right but that day, we had lamb terrine, chili salami, board head croquette.
~My fave was the salami and it pairs perfectly with the preserves whereas the croquette is a close second, it was served piping hot and so flavorful on it's own, ~ This was really a nice sharing plate at a really reasonable price, perfect for a wine drinking person like me :)

 Smoked Trout $14
~ sauteed kale, soybean hummus, antipasto
~This was probably my fave dish of the night, everything here was so delish and the tough part here was to try to get a bit of everything in each bite.
~Love how the smoked fish wasn't salty, in fact it was quite mild where you get a taste of the smokiness but also the full on flavor of the fish itself. Every component on this dish was balanced so well, nothing overpowering the other but complimented each other perfectly.

 Coq au Vin $25
~ pommes puree, pearl onions, bacon, mushrooms
~ A super rustic tasting dish and was very delicious but nothing too memorable that I would make me order it again.

 Stn. Burger $20
~ aged cheddar, beet chutney, rosemary fries, radish salad
~This was exactly like Marben's burger which is one of my fave which I alwasy complain about it being too small, but somehow this version felt a tiny bit bigger. ~ I also really liked the radish salad at the farm corner but wish there was a bit more... maybe a salad or something since the fries was rather plain and a way too large of a portion compare to the burger itself. 
 ~ Just like I remember it, the perfectly cook juicy burger (just a beautiful color) 
Ben ordered this but I end up eating half =P

 Date Bar $9
Gooyee date bar w/ smoked hay ice cream and salted caramel

 Verdict :
Found that a lot of components here are just like Marben, so I don't see a reason why I don't like this place but hope they will come up with something totally different soon.
I will definitely be back, maybe try their lunch.
Great Food & Great Service"}
{"text":"The service was incredible, atmosphere cute, reasonably priced.  The food was cooked great but I wasn't a fan of the flavor profiles."}
{"text":"Great service and food! Any fish here is worth getting. Cooked to perfection! The duck was really good too. So glad we discovered this gem! The vibe just feels like Toronto. Can't wait to go back and try something new!"}
{"text":"Being a huge Top Chef fan, I obviously had to try out winner Chef Carl Heinrich's new restaurant. Marben was one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto so needless to say, I was super stoked to eat at Richmond Station. However, my experience here was inevitably compared to my dinner at runner-up Trevor's Bird's restaurant, Fable, in Vancouver. Notably, both restaurants embrace a farm-to-table dining concept. 

We started with fresh bread, served with some soya oil and balsamic vinegar that was absolutely awesome. My mom kept bugging to me ask for more bread because she loved dip so much.

Being a polenta-lover, I also ordered polenta fries ($8) with bomba mayonnaise and marinara to share. The outside was superbly crispy with a soft, creamy interior. One complaint I had was that the bomba mayonnaise was smeared onto the serving board, hardly enough for me to properly taste. I really wished there was more for dipping. While the marinara was nice, I didn't think it was the best complement for the fries. I wanted a dip with more tang. 

For our mains, we both chose something from the daily special menu. My mom opted for duo of beef ($26) - striploin and braised shortribs with truffled celery purée, arugula, pickled shallots. The first thing we dug into was the arugula salad, and it was fantastic. The greens were bright and acidic, I wanted a whole plate of it!The striploin was cooked to a beautiful medium rare, and my mom enjoyed it a lot. The braised short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth tender. While the protein was well-executed, what stood out the most for me was the truffled celery purée. Luckily for me, the celery was quite mellow (I happen to hate celery), and the purée was flavourful and lusciously creamy.   

While studying the menu, my mom and I reminisced over how much we loved the duck dish at Fable. With that in mind, I couldn't resist trying the duck confit here ($25) with roasted cauliflower, lentils and sunchokes. We both loved the crispy skin and the duck leg was delicious. This might not have been the most innovative dish, but it was a well-executed classic.  Aside from the duck, the other components on the dish were also tasty, particularly the roasted sunchoke and cauliflower purée. I'm thrilled to see that more and more restaurants are incorporating sunchokes in their menu, as they are absolutely delicious. 

I was a little disappointed that the much raved about bread pudding wasn't on the special menu of the day. So instead, we chose another daily special- apple tarte tatin ($9) with walnuts and almond ice cream. What I loved about the dessert was that it was so homey, yet elegant at the same time. I have to say that this dessert was probably the best part of the entire meal! The tarte tatin was to-die-for, accompanied by the most delicious almond ice cream. The best way to enjoy this is to combine a little bit of everything - the pastry, tangy apple, gooey caramel, and almond cream- into one heavenly bite! I guarantee you will not be disappointed!

Our bill was accompanied by a small cube of salted caramel, a lovely gesture to end off the amazing night. On the whole, my mom and I both enjoyed our dinner very much, though we agreed that perhaps we liked Fable just a little bit more (that duck is still on my mind!). The food here isn't as innovative, but nevertheless, the commitment to delicious food and excellent service is quite evident."}
{"text":"This was excellent! The service was impeccable and the food was delicious.  We got the pate as an appetizer, and I got the duck two ways and my boyfriend got the pork.  Everything was incredible--- highly recommend this gem"}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food when I first went there. Became one of my favorite spot when I'm in the area. Their house burger, which was recommended by my waitress, did not disappoint, cooked to a perfect medium rare, with just the right amount of seasoning. The bun was also perfect soft to go with the patty.  I would also have to praise their pate starter, the perfect balance of flavors, loved it! If you're looking for great food and atmosphere, would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend because it was rated #1 in Toronto on TripAdvisor, it did not disappoint. The menu was relatively small but everything sounded delicious - We had the polenta fries to share, which I highly suggest. I got the braised beef ravioli, he got the swordfish, we both loved our meals. It's no surprise the chef won Top Chef Canada!

I would definitely return the next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Outstanding.

My daughter brought us here for lunch, raving about the menu. We were certainly not disappointed. I opted for Rabbit Two Ways with
squash puree, braised daikon, bbq eggplant, black garlic and sesame jus. The rabbit was prepared very nicely with lots of flavor and very tender, but the bbq eggplant with cinnamon was absolutely incredible and even a day later I'm still thinking about how it burst with flavor. The squash puree was also a great contrast to the spicy sweetness of the eggplant. 

Without question, this is an amazing little gem in the city. We will be back and I'm already looking forward to it. Reservations are recommended. Also, check out the website as the menu changes day to day and the restaurant also offers lots of other interesting events."}
{"text":"The main chef here won Top Chef, and the food definitely tastes like it!

I ordered the Braised Beef, and started with a soup - both served small portions but I could tell the ingredients were of the highest quality.

The waitress was extremely kind and professional, suggesting in great detail what the specials and dishes on the menu for the day were - she also happened to be training another new employee, who intently filled our water!

Great place for a formal meal, expect a high price which is justified by the high quality."}
{"text":"A fantastic neighbourhood restaurant to wine and dine if you plan to impress yours truly. Because it is always busy,  reservation has to be made a couple of days in advance.  And you know what... it's well worth it.  When i first entered the restaurant, i immediately liked the casual elegant ambience that the space projected.  Nothing fancy - just that pleasant feeling that tells you to relax and enjoy.  
I was told that i would be in for an evening of the chef's tasting menu.  The server asked us a couple of questions about our preferences so the chefs could create food catered to us.    8 dishes in total came and went.  With each, the server introduced the food content before leaving us to savor the ingenuity of the individual labour of love.   Every dish deserved a standing ovation, but if i had to choose my favourite, it would be the black cod.  The skin was crispy and the meat was delightfully tender with complementing sauce to match.
Above all, the various staff who came to our table were amazing.  I felt that they were passionate about what they do, and that they were very knowledgeable about the ingredients.  I love how they were so personable and easy to talk to.  It really completed an evening of an excellent experience."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night without reservations. They were so full, we got two seats at the bar after some wait. They were showing fully booked on their website for a few days before we went so we decided to just walk in. 
Had polenta fries for appetizer, they were very good. Had perogies and station burger for our mains. Perogies were a little underwhelming but still very good. Station burger was delicious. We had the carrot cake dessert. It had many different elements and pieces but was too sweet overall. 
Service was excellent. Reason for 3 star is because I'm comparing to other restaurants in this price range, could have been better."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is just awesome!   Outstanding service from everyone you will interact with.  Great cocktails and drinks. Fantastic decor.  I had the Ceverieh and skate (a white fish) main.  Chief must me Michelin ranked.  I did not have a burger but questioning the price a bit and now I know why it's not your average burger allegedly they cut all meat in house and put some short rib and other fine meats in there - burgers coming out looked awesome as well.   Also the slow roast du jour looked out of this world - total comfort.  May come back to Toronto just to come back to this place."}
{"text":"Make sure you book your table in advance. This place is amazing. We came here to celebrate a birthday and it was the best restaurant for the occasion. We ordered cocktails - I had the Milk Punch, it is the best cocktail I have ever had. The beef tartare was unique and flavourful. The pate was very good and had a generous sharing portion. Had the duck duo which was perfectly cooked and balanced. I wasn't the biggest fan of the desserts because I lean more to a traditional desserts but the creativity and flavours were intricate. Highly Recommend dinning here."}
{"text":"Finally checked out this restaurant on Richmond street. We really enjoyed it. The staff were friendly. We love that it's an open kitchen. The food was spectacular!! We ordered the beef tartare and the salad as an appetizers. They were delicious! My! My my my! It must've been one of the best salads and cutest tartare we've ever had!!!! Then of course we had the burger which was wonderful! Highly recommend this little hidden gem, tucked in a corner in the middle of bustling DTO!"}
{"text":"This restaurant came highly recommended and we were not disappointed.We had a brook trout salad with lemon and squash and mint. It was amazing. Also lobster cocktail served on lettuce-very lightly battered and fantastic. The main was pork done with squash and salsa etc. and so so good. Really gourmet. The service was great and we enjoyed watching the kitchen. What a great show of expertise. The only negative was a disinterested and blah hostess. She needs to up her game to fit in."}
{"text":"Being a fan of Top Chef Canada, I've been here several times ever since the restaurant opened. Recently went back with my family and the food is delicious as ever. 

What we had:
- Chicken liver mousse - Very creamy and delicious, full of flavour!
- Polenta fries - super crispy and they worked well with the marinara sauce
- Other members of my party had roasted beet salad and cream of mushroom soup which they said were delicious.
- Mains we had braised beef ravioli, scallops, duck, and fish special.
- Dessert - Apple mille-feuille - presentation was like a work of art! And it was delicious as well.

Will be back for more."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. We tried many of the appetizers which were all delicious. I had the pear and candies pecan salad and the braised beef ravioli; both were very tasty! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"After much searching on Yelp, Richmond Station came up as one of the more highly-touted restaurants, with a fairly innovative menu to match. Scored a reservation for a Friday dinner in Toronto, and we were quickly seated in the back section. It definitely seems like there's a dichotomy of experiences, with the front area for more of an intimate vibe, whereas the back area was where most of the larger groups were sitting, so it was slightly more boisterous. However, being seated in the back area, it wasn't disruptive at all, and I really enjoyed seeing the open kitchen and the chefs hard at work, churning out the dinner service.

I was a bit intrigued by the bourbon cocktails they had on the menu, one of which included a vanilla-cherry extract. I usually don't go for those flavors, but the waitress recommended it and said it wasn't too sweet, so I went for it. I really wish I hadn't. The cocktail basically just tasted like a vanilla coke with bourbon, and was way too sweet, even with the assurance that the sweetness would be more subtle. Some people have different palates, so I'm not going to put that on the waitress for her recommendation. Moving on.

As for food, we ended up going for the rabbit liver pâté, the mushroom agnolotti, and the Moscovy duck. I thought the dishes we ordered tasted good, but it just seemed like each dish had one ingredient too many. Perhaps it was just our dish choices, but the little pieces of fried sourdough didn't really add anything to the mushroom agnolotti. The sweet potatoes with the rhubarb chutney in the duck dish was a little confusing to me, as the sweetness from both components clashed a bit. Also, the sweetness from the chutney in the rabbit liver pâté was just a little too overpowering. So really, maybe back off the chutneys a little bit? That said, the agnolotti had a great earthy taste and texture from the mushrooms, and the duck itself was delicious and cooked to the right temperature and tenderness. 

Service was very attentive and friendly, although it was quite strange to be offered bread AFTER our rabbit liver appetizer. That bread might have been more useful to sop up any remaining dregs of the pâté. Oh well. Also, our waitress did forget to tell us about the specials, and we didn't know they even had specials until after we ordered, so that was a little frustrating. Prices are easily higher for the area, but the portions seem fine, and the menu does have fairly unique offerings, so the value's not bad.  

A solid dining choice in the area. The menu is pretty unique, and the chefs do seem like they're trying to push the envelope, so that's definitely appreciated. Not sure if I'd make a return trip if back in Toronto, given the plethora of great restaurants in the area, but I guess I'd recommend the place for a casual date or small get-together."}
{"text":"It was so so. I would go back but try something other than the hamburger. The hamburger was too greasy and otherwise had no taste. Busy busy but the waitstaff were friendly, polite and did not put on airs.
Expensive. They also should really enlarge their bathroom."}
{"text":"Featured Chef: Chef Carl Heinrich..2012 Top Chef Canada winner, and executive chef/owner at Richmond Station.  It was a wonderful coincidence to cross paths with this fun and talented chef on Wednesday, which lead to an impromptu interview the following day. It has been 5 years and a launch of his very successful restaurant since winning the Top Chef Canada spot in season two, Chef Carl is still running full speed with no sign of stopping anytime soon. Chef Carl and his team of 20 chefs work seamlessly in the clean kitchen to execute mouthwatering dishes for his diners.  His menu consists of dishes that were created around the seasonal ingredients rather than a particular type of cuisine. I opted for the famous Station Burger inspired from his days working at Daniel Boulud at DB Bistro Moderne in New York City and it was juicy and full of savory deliciousness. There are dishes such as Slow Cooked Rainbow Trout: glazed fingerling potatoes, roasted beets, horseradish cream, dill, scallion, or the Grilled Cornish Hen: farro, fiddleheads, pickled ramps, watercress cream, hazelnut pesto, hen jus, and perhaps the Rabbit Two Ways: brown butter-parsnip puree, mustard cabbage, roasted apple, bacon jus. On top of the main menu, Chef Carl and his team also offer a daily prix-fixe menu which changes 2 times a day. I also had the refreshing Bubble Tea: milk tea ganache, tapioca pudding, nori, matcha, lychee sorbet. 
I admire Chef Carl's dedication to his craft, and his relentless pursuit to be the best chef every single day. I'm so very glad for the impromptu interview with Chef Carl in my trip to Toronto. One of the most inspiring interviews thus far. A ginormous thank you to Chef Carl for for being most accommodating with my interview time. Until next time, stay awesome!"}
{"text":"By far the best restaurant I visited in Toronto. Top 5 in the world for me as of this review. Reserve the Chef's Table - you will NOT regret it. The most personal attention, the best show in the house, and wonderful company all around. Call in or swing by in person to reserve because you can't specifically request on Opentable.

First off, get the tasting menu if you don't have any dietary restrictions. For me, I have a dairy sensitivity and the kitchen staff accommodated masterfully. I ended up getting the halibut special (flown in from B.C. same day) and the rabbit with the most delicious pork belly I've ever had + fried duck confit. Unbelievable. Mouth watering. Not enough adjectives to describe. Then, since everyone around me was going gaga over the burger, I had to try it and boy was I impressed. Easily the best burger in Toronto. Alice took the ABSOLUTE MOST WONDERFUL care of me - she's definitely earned a spot in my customer service hall of fame.  

TL;DR Must visit while in Toronto. Or if you're ever planning to travel to Canada for that matter. Fly in and stop at Richmond Station to dine on your way to culinary heaven."}
