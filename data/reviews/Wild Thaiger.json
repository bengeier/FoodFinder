{"text":"Had lunch here today.   Took a few extra minutes to clean off tables and seat us but were friendly.  Lunch specials were a great deal (hubby had the Beef Panang* {gf}
spicy red chili curry for $7.95)
but while my Seafood Panang was delicious, I thought the portion would be a tad larger for $16.95.  Lunch was fantastic and we will be back but I'll stick to a more budget friendly lunch special."}
{"text":"The Decha Boar was fantastic.  Only reason for the 4 stars is because of the wait. Seemed like they did not have enough staff on hand to take care of the crowd. Worth the wait but ended up arriving late to the concert we had later in the night."}
{"text":"They don't have the same people cooking looks like it's changes hands because nothing looks familiar and use to have happy hour and was in the other day and they said no happy hour and our would be server never seen her before she was Korean not thai to fat unsure of what's up with this place no one was there and there usually busy so I don't know"}
{"text":"Loved it! Had some beef lunch curry dish. It was excellent. Tasty and beautiful. 8$ really!?! Cheap. Went for lunch and it was busy-thats a good thing. To ppl that post bad reviews because it took 10 mins to get your cocktail or whatever-shut up! Go to a \"dead\" Thai restaurant. There's a reason Wild Thaiger is busy. Because its fuckn bomb!!"}
{"text":"Last year gave it a 5. This year downgraded because noise level was so high. Tom Kha Gai was superb. The special was a crispy Mako Shark. Very good even though I'm not a fan of crispy. The presentation was excellent. Top notch service. Uncomfortable bench booth seats"}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant near my hotel for dinner and it was packed on the inside, but they had the mist going on outside so the Phoenix heat was manageable. Waitress was nice and quick with the drinks for it being busy. Had the chicken spring rolls for an appetizer and they were deliciously crunchy, they come in orders of 4. For dinner I had the Kimow and it was also very good as it wasn't too dry, but just right. The beer selection could be a little better, but it is not bad. A lot of Asian beers. Also had a glass of mango juice that was alright, nothing special. All in all, if I were to come back to Phoenix and this area, I would come back to eat at this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Saw this on DDD and was looking forward to trying it (huge thai food fan) and was honestly let down. Was told there would be a 15 minute wait for an inside table, fine. Waited at the bar until my mother literally had to flag someone down for a drink menu after 15 minutes of going unnoticed. (there was a sign that said \"waiting only\" but 3 other people were seated at the bar wih drinks??) 

There were several empty tables so I dont really understand their system or why we had such a ling wait. Finally got seated and ordered dragon eggs for an appetizer. Pretty tasty but nothing special. I did have to ask my waiter 3 times for a glass of water. I'm very patient but that's a bit ridiculous. When  I did get my water there was no apology.

Ordered coconut soup (they were out of the fuel to make the hot pot, well, hot). Broth was a bit thicker than I like and very sweet, and the amount of veggies in it was half of what I've received at other places. Their menu items are certainly interesting (wild boar and catfish) and watching the open kitchen was fun. But we literally felt ignored for a majority of our dining experience. Really wanted more from here..."}
{"text":"I love the Wild Thaiger, it is the best Thai food I have experienced in Phoenix.  They have plenty of vegetarian options and I have ordered just about all of them, they are all equally delicious.  I love the corn fritters... MMMM"}
{"text":"The food looked great, but unfortunately we didn't get to try it because of the wait.  

The wait, of course, doesn't deserve the two-star rating - but the service does.  We waited for almost 20 minutes to even be acknowledged by the angsty teen hostess with glazed over eyes, only to be told the wait would be 45 minutes.  Lazy Thaiger."}
{"text":"The first time for me at any Thai restaurant means one thing - Pad Thai.  Right or wrong, that's the screening process I use to base a possible return.

I'm happy to report that the Pad Thai is very good here - maybe not the best I've had in the Valley but not far from it.  My dining partner reported his dish (Curry Chicken) was delicious too.  And the Thai iced coffee is so damn good they should list it under desserts. 

Comfortable vibe, friendly staff, good beer selection, ample parking, reasonable prices, nice patio, and from the photos, a big hit with our local newscasters."}
{"text":"YUM! We ordered the Panang Chicken Curry and the Dragon Ballz and they delicious. This is a nice authentic place. Highly recommend. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food you will ever eat! This IS my favorite Thai food restaurant! I have far too many items on the menu that taste AMAZING but don't miss dessert! My favorite dessert is the (homemade) coconut icecream with the fried bananas on the side. AMAZING! Simply amazing. It's my favorite dessert of ALL TIME!
I must add that I really love peanut butter chicken (a childhood favorite) and this restaurant gets it perfect every time!"}
{"text":"Came to lunch today, we were a group of 7, service was not great, took a long time for orders to come out, and there was 2 orders that came out 5-10 minutes later than the others, so the food got cold as we waited to eat together. The food was good, no problem there, everyone has a bad day so today we got to experience theirs."}
{"text":"I truly like the food here but the service continues to be horrible. Tonight we had the booth right next to the front entrance so we were not hidden by any stretch of the imagination. After 18 mins the waitress came by and said she also had a table outside, which could be good because she would be walking past us often - not. After waiting that long to be asked if we would like something to drink we knew we should order for the entire meal right then so we did. The busser brought our drinks shortly,a diet coke and an ice tea that was luke warm. 21 minutes later as we were getting ready to leave because many employees wandered past but never asked how we were or offered to fill our empty glasses - our dragon eggs were brought to the table, by another waitress - not ours of course, haven't seen her at our table since we ordered. They were delicious, always are. 20 mins later I see (the kitchen is open) what looks like what we ordered put on the shelf to be picked up by the server. After about 5 mins I commented to my wife that I hope that is not our meals because they are getting cold. 9 mins after that another waitress picked up those plates and (indeed they were ours) brought them to us. She did offer us refills for our drinks & actually made sure my iced tea had ice.The food was good - but not hot - it would have been delicious if it was. Sadly as we sat there in our vantage point by the door we watched 3 groups-a total of 10 customer walk out because no one came to their table. We have been long time customers but this may have been the last time - we even made it a point to frequent this restaurant during the light rail construction because we new business would drop with the difficulty of getting into the place. We finally saw our waitress when the meal was over - she was sooo polite and friendly when she gave us the bill. We thought maybe she quit because we hadn't seen her since she took our order. Maybe this should just become a take-out place - like I say good food but the service stinks."}
{"text":"Some of the best Pad Thai I've ever had in my life! Huge portion, had leftovers :) If you are ever craving Thai food this is the place to be hands down!"}
{"text":"Thai is my favorite food....this was my first restaurant in Phoenix when we moved here 5 years ago and I feel the quality of food had gone down and is no longer very consistent. 
We order veggie spring rolls, papaya salad, veggie pad thai and 24 k ( curry with eggplant ) along with 2 teas jasmine and white ambrosia teas (so yummy ).
Slow customer service....we waited forever to get an extra white rice, almost done with our meal by the time it came out and also waiting for our check. Dont plan on coming here if you are short on time !"}
{"text":"If it were just for the food they would get a 4!!! While this is better than most american thai food it is not 100% authentic. 
That being said, the spice level is usually good (as in there is actual spice!!) and the catfish prigking is AMAZING!!
The service is pretty dismal - the hostess stand is like a revolving door - with most hostesses not lasting long.... The wait staff is equally bad, with the exception being Nate & the hardworking buser (a young girl). The kitchen is staffed by a very small staff led by the owner.
The food is consistent & pretty good but be prepared to wait! (Usually 20+min after you are seated)"}
{"text":"This place is great.  I was really surprised that Phoenix would have such a good Thai place.  The food is excellent.  The price is very reasonable.  And the staff are really friendly.  I have been in Phoenix for 2 1/2 months and I have eaten here at least a half a dozen times."}
{"text":"Great dinner last night. Our waiter was super helpful in recommending items and specialties on the menu. The owner, Dave, was there. He stopped by our table and made our dinner even better! Some of the best Thai food we have had."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and each of them have been great. I've only gotten the pad Thai and it's bomb. They've also got gluten free pad Thai for those who prefer that and that dish is also amazing"}
{"text":"This is a must try if you live in Phoenix and like Thai food. Great food, clean/hip place, great service, reasonably priced...what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Wow! The smell got me from the moment my dining partner and I entered. I could just tell things were \"right\" about this place. Then we saw the plates walk by..and the plates in front of the seated diners. I've paid a lot for smaller plates in the past. These plates could feed an army, and they are stacked with fresh cilantro, sprouts and frisee' beets. Truly a gorgeous spectacle of food.

We could not believe the cheap price, too...$9 for the pad thai. It was THE BEST pad Thai we've ever tasted, and we've had it all over the country. Because the place was packed on a Tuesday afternoon lunch rush we were seated at the bar and served right away.

I had the Thai iced coffee, served elegantly in a tall ice-filled glass. Strong and sweet. My dining partner had tea served in a French press. We had a soup starter (the broth was perfection), shared a plate of fresh spring rolls, which are the best I've had since I ate them for the first time in 1985 at Arc En Ciel in Garland, TX, because Wild Thaiger uses mint leaves--the only way to do them in my book. They were not only delicious, and were accompanied by an exquisite peanut/citrus blend sauce with hints of anise...they were plated beautifully. Served two for $9.

The place is smallish....four booths and the rest tables, with a few  cafe height two-tops lining the hallway toward the bathrooms in the back that were obviously added out of necessity. The bar over looks an open kitchen where the owner/head chef prepares food next to assistant chefs. It is a show in itself.

Photos line the walls near the bathrooms and some of them are impressive--the head chef with some local celebrities and one with Steven Seagal. What were most impressive to us are the photos of their annual celebrations. Brightly costumed servers and performers...We want to know when these take place!

If you love Thai...GO THERE!"}
{"text":"I stayed nearby on a business trip and was in the mood for Thai, so I called in an order for pick-up.  I ordered the Galee Gai (chicken and potatoes in yellow curry over rice) and spring rolls on the side.  Both were fantastic!  The curry is definitely spicy, but it's the good spicy you're probably looking for if you want Thai.  The spring rolls were crispy and delicious and came with a sweet-spicy dipping sauce.  The portions were great - neither too small, nor a ton of wasted leftovers.

When I walked in to pick up the order, I was pleasantly surprised: black tables and chairs, nice table settings (complete with linen napkins and wine glasses), a very nice bar setting (great for eating alone), and plently of booths, \"typical\" tables, and high-top tables.  The kitchen is behind the bar, and you can pretty much see everything going on back there, so there's no question about cleanliness or sketchy food preparation.  I also saw one of the cooks plating some food, and it was one heck of a presentation!

I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars, if I could.

Good Thai food, but not my favorite. I would rather eat here than not eat Thai food (if I had to choose), but there are some Thai places that I like better."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place got so many good reviews. The food is terrible. Pad Thai is mediocre at best. The peanut sauce is more like gravy then sauce, thick and gritty. Won't ever come back here for lunch as it took way too long to get our food. And to top it off my tummy felt all bubbly afterwards. Over all it was a poor experience."}
{"text":"Go here for the food, but most importantly, the mango sticky rice dessert. HEAVEN.  I work around the corner so come here once a month or so. The owner is a very sweet lady and the servers remember us which is heartwarming. 

I enjoy their pad thai quite a bit and have tried other dishes as well. They're soups are fantastic and so is their iced tea!"}
{"text":"Went on my birthday after St. Francis had an hour long wait.  Very happy with our decision.  Had the ginger martini.  Very sweet, but very good.  Then, we shared the vegetarian appetizer plate.  The corn fritters are mind blowing good!  Never had anything like that before.  I had the tofu pad thai, which was perfect!  The hubby had the mahi mahi which was good, but could have used more sauce. Our friends split the yellow curry which was some of the best I've had in town.  Great heat and flavor.  Bathrooms were clean and nicely decorated.  The whole place had a positive vibe and friendly (though not the most prompt) service.  Will go back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Haven't been in a few years and the food did not disappoint. Delicious curry chicken and great presentation. The service, however, greatly disappointed. Waited and waited for the server from beginning to end even having to go up to the cash register to request and pay my bill. I think she may have spoken 20 words to me total.
Did not at all leave a good taste in my mouth. 
I think it'll be another few years!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing food and great service. We have been there over 10 times and it consistently is one of the better restaurants in town. I don't live any where near but travel there because I enjoy the dining experience so much. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Good eating. Chill atmosphere. Nice staff.

Arrived to the restraunt, which is walking distance from the Hilton Phoenix Suites, and the place was packed inside so my friend and I decided to eat on the patio. It was hot out but the patio is covered and has ceiling fans with a light mist so the heat wasn't much of a factor in our sitting. 

I ordered the veggie spring rolls and the vegetable and tofu Pad Thai with the Thaigers Milk Boba to drink.

Veggie spring rolls were perfectly crisp and fresh with minimal grease. (My friend prefenced the chicken sping rolls and raved about them.) The veggie Pad Thai came out separated for you to mix. I am very picky as how much sauce comes in a dish and I personally felt the sauce to food ratio was right on the mark. The Boba drink was awesome. Not too sweet and punch of coconut flavor, which I love coconut everything. 

My expierience was on the higher end of good. Ticket came out to $22.64 and I had to take food home. You can't go wrong for choosing this place."}
{"text":"Good service, food and drinks! I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys Thai food."}
{"text":"They do not serve authentic Thai food here.  For one, they deep fry the fish here which means they use frozen (not fresh) fish.  They also used a very thick sauce on our non-curry dish, which is not Thai style at all.  Their tom yum soup is better than their dishes."}
{"text":"The general consensus that Thaiger is worth a 4 -- so true. Thoroughly enjoyed my meal, but wasn't lickin the sauce off my plate for more. 

The interior is very intimate and you can view the chefs cookin up your meals behind the bar (I hear it gets hot if you're sitting in that area). By 6:30p on a random Tues. night it was busy. Service was prompt and friendly, and everything that my friends and I ordered happened to be suggestions from the waitress herself.

We started with the Satay Sampler that included beef, chicken and shrimp. Excellent presentation and meat, but since I'm not a giant fan of peanut sauce, this app. was just so-so. 

Kristin R. got the Holy Basil Chicken, which we all agreed was the best choice. The sauce of this stir-fry like dish is truly what made it *pop*. Even on a hot night, eating something warm like this just felt comforting. Not too overpowering, just the right amount of kick to it. Chris C. got the Pla Duk Grapao, catfish covered in a similar sauce as the Holy Basil. Yum as well, and cooked just right so the fish flaked well. Lastly, I got the Beef filet & Green Papaya Salad. The filet was very thin and cooked well, yet I can't see myself fully enjoying it w/o the green chili the sauce that came on the side (make sure you dip into this one). The green papaya salad was def a hit for me. The papaya is shredded so finely that it appears to be noodle-like. It's very summer-like, while having a definite spice to the chili dressing its soaked in. 

Loved their homemade Thai Iced Tea as well (they prepared it there I noticed, as the cream was still separated when brought out), and want to come back in the future to try one of their hot pot soups.

Great recommendation from my coworker!"}
{"text":"I don't have anything bad to say.  Everything was great from the amazing food to the fantastic service."}
{"text":"Ok, I had tried this place a month or so ago at lunch and was unimpressed, but the other day a friend said she wanted it for dinner.  I obliged.  I was blown away by the Panang curry.  Rich, thick, spicy.  We had it for take out and it survived the trip home fine.  I now need to go back and try some other dishes just to make sure it wasn't just a freak occurrence."}
{"text":"Thai food is one of my favorite Asian cuisines.  The only flaw of this place was the wait time.  Food was delicious and service was friendly.

We came on a Monday so it wasn't too busy.  I had the vegetarian soup and the chicken Pad Thai made Thai HOT.  I really like the flavor of Thai hot dishes.  I'm really a fan of this place so I would really recommend it.  

Vegetarian friendly so it's great for everyone.  The bathroom was clean so that's Always good in my book.  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I was surprised at how good this place was. A friend and I went on a whim and the crowd inside was a lot older (60's-70's) and mostly just drinking. We ordered the Tom Kai Gai and I have to say it was the best I've ever had in Arizona. It was spicy but extremely flavorful the consistency of the rice was gloriously sticky.We also tried the hot teas I ordered the Gunpowder Temple of Heaven and she got the Lemon Souffle` and both were beautifully prepared and flavored. The Pad Thai and Panang were both spiced to perfection and the service was great and our waitress was so friendly and helpful I wanted to come back the very next day. They also work with you on how spicy you want your dishes so if you prefer an extra kick just ask but I'd recommend trying the dishes how they prepare them first since I like spice and thought they did a great job of making the dishes spicy but not to the point where the spice overpowers the dish."}
{"text":"This place will satisfy a craving for Thai food, but the aesthetics and practicality of the menu is poorly put together. 

I don't doubt that the service is usually better too, but it was clear they were short-staffed for whatever reason the night I went, so the it took longer to order than I would have liked.

I ordered the Kimow, which is a dish I have been looking for on the menus of various Thai restaurants in AZ, but have never been able to find. Needless to say, I was excited! Alas, at the arrival of my food, I was disappointed. It was a small portion for paying 10 dollars, but I will say it was tasty. 

It is starting to get hot now and the evening's cold air was starting to set in, so we sat outside, which was nice. Inside looked clean and the booths are rather private, which is neat. 

My biggest complaint was the layout of the menu itself. This may sound kind of stuck up, but it really made a difference to me. It is kind of scattered looking and the selection, as it is presented, appears small. Plus, the menu doesn't obviously inform the customer that all their specialties and items that say they're made with this or that meat, can actually be replaced with another meat or tofu (if you're vegan or vegetarian like me). 

Needless to say, I always value trying new restaurants, especially of my favorite cuisine. Wild Thaiger, unfortunately, probably won't be one of those places I insist on going to when I go to Phx though. Like I said, it'll satisfy, but it pretty mediocre."}
{"text":"Good food for lunch during the week.

Thaiger doesn't have authentic-tasting Thai (or is that it doesn't taste like Americanized Thai food places in other cities? This is getting confusing). That said, it has a nice, short, and consistent lunch menu. The peanut chicken is great, as is the pad thai (doesn't taste like normal pad thai, but it's good: chicken, tofu, and shrimp, with lots of peanuts).

But I think a different chef comes in for dinner and weekends, because the dishes are remarkably different. I don't understand what's going on.

In other words, come for lunch."}
{"text":"It's taken me many months to get around to writing this but I can't seem to stop thinking about it...so I'm compelled make this known by ALL who will read it. This restaurant to had decent Thai food and the service was just ok. That would have been fine had the waiter not taken the liberty of changing the amount of the tip I indicated on my Visa receipt. When I reviewed my statement online and discovered he had done that, I printed the statement and took it and the receipt (as proof) back to the restaurant to explain what happened to the manager. The manager refunded my entire tip in cash. Some would say that should have solved it, but for some reason the manager's reaction to the incident wasn't what I had hoped for. It felt more like he wanted me to simply go away with cash rather than regain my confidence as a customer. I went with what it felt like. Haven't been back and will likely NEVER return."}
{"text":"The food is super tasty, the decor is nice, but the service could be improved upon. 

My husband and I try to stop here if we're in the area because the food is so delicious and elegantly served. The pad Thai and curries are tasty as is the Thai iced tea (creamy sweet tea with ice). I usually order the yellow curry with chicken. 

Lunch hour is very busy so you might get stuck waiting for your server. 

Once we went after the lunch-hour rush, but still ended up with sub par service because the staff was eating their lunch. 

Despite the sometimes slow service, we come back because of the quality and taste of the food."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch for pickup. It was ready when I got there, the place is clean, cool and refreshing. The food was SO FLAVORFUL!!!! No soggy bland phad thai here! The SO GOOD. :) I will DEFINITLY come here again."}
{"text":"Place was good. Long wait during lunch hours. Sometimes you are not attended to at all by the workers there."}
{"text":"ooooh soooo delish
Great lunch specials, small but outdoor patio option and great ambiance with food that continues to bring me back"}
{"text":"I've been eating at The Wild Thaiger at least once a week for the last 3 years..Hands down this is the best thai food I have ever had! I have never been dissapointed by anything I've eaten here. The staff and owner are always friendly and attentive and the prices are reasonable. I would probably eat here every night of the week if I had the chance.

All of the appetizers are delish but the dragon eggs are probably my favorite, tasty dumplings with a tangy sauce topped with jalapeno rounds, so good! Their crab crisps are the best you will ever have! My favorite dish of the moment is the Rama of the jungle. Delicious melt in your mouth beef skewers with flavorful rice fritters and spicy green papaya salad YUM! All of their curries are amazing and so is thier peanut sauce. There is honestly nothing here I wouldn't recommend, I even like their tofu dishes, and normally I won't eat tofu. Oh and don't forget dessert, awesome cheesecakes and coconut ice cream, even a delicious chocolate cake.  

If you love fresh, mouth-watering thai food, check this place out, I'm sure you will enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good foods. And nice waitress.
I'm a visitor from LA.  And I always want Thai FOod!!! That's why I found this restaurant 

I ordered...

-Pad kra prow Kai : real taste of thai*
-Sa tey : Full flavor
-Tom Kha Kai : So rich and too sweet for me. But my bf love it (I'm. Thai)
-Pad c aew : More than ok but not great!"}
{"text":"Updating to give five stars. We've eaten here twice more since and the food is consistently amazing. My boyfriend got the Temple of Fire today and holy cow, it was so good. Very spicy, but that was to be expected. We've tried about six dishes so far and each has been something I'd recommend."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed. The food was way over priced. The quality of the food was okay. The rice wasn't fresh. The fresh rolls tasted old. The Thai tea was good. But over all I'll most likely not go here again."}
{"text":"Fresh food, reasonable prices.
Attractive and attentive staff.
Broad range on the menu.
No complete sentences.
You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pumpkin curry burned my face off! It was tasty but wow. Could have used a warning. Food is a bit over done in terms of presentation and the wait can be deadly."}
{"text":"Had lunch today. Chicken curry had more potato filling and that was disappointing. Restaurant is OK, not 5 star"}
{"text":"A simple spot to enjoy good quality Thai food here in Central Phoenix.  True, the decor is kind of low key and the building kind of plain-jane...but the staff is always very friendly, sweet and attentive, and the food just plain delish.   My personal favorite is the Tom Ka Gai hot pot with Shrimp.  Great flavors and plenty big enough for two to share.  The patio is nice and usually less crowded than the inside of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Been here twice and each time ended up having to make a rush trip to the bathroom after. The first time the shrimp came out uncooked, I sent it back and it seemed fine. Barely made it out of the restaurant before I had to rush to the restroom. The second time around, I had the same issue except also 24 hours of stomach cramps. A few other issues with service but minor compared to routine food poisoning."}
{"text":"I had lunch here 3 days ago and ordered yellow curry. It was very good and pretty spicy which I really enjoyed. 

The curry was so good I went back tonight and ordered it again. What I got had to be the blandest yellow curry I have ever had. The curry really needed salt and it had no heat whatsoever. Very disappointing. 

I realize any resturant can have an off night so I will try them again in hopes of getting what I got days before."}
{"text":"Here in Phoenix from out of town and looking for a good place to eat dinner. I happened upon Wild Thaiger. Great food and cocktails. Good value. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Slow service.  It would be 5 stars if the server was more attentive.  I arrived and waited at the hostess stand, beside the sign that read, wait to be seated!  Maybe waited 5 minutes or more.  The restaurant was mostly empty.  Only two other tables.  One server sitting at the bar eating.  One server working the two tables.  No hostess.  Sat down outside.  Nice patio.  But patio is an excuse I guess for server to disappear for 10 or more minutes at a time.  Whoosh...gone...not to be seen a gain for a long while.  Hmmm.  Drink order?  Appetizer? More water?  Improve this service and it could be 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great food, great restaurant setting. My favorite is the Thai tea but I found a hair in the Thai tea cup. I would've given a 4 star but the hair took it down. I don't see their employees wearing hair nets in the kitchen, maybe they should."}
{"text":"Went here for date night and the food was awesome!! We got the spring rolls 2 ways: chicken and veggie. The dipping sauce was delish! Then we had the hot pot soup with coconut and lime broth. It was such a neat presentation. Then we ordered the Thai basil and the pad Thai. Both dishes were great. I would defiantly be back!! Also it was rated by food networks drivers dine-ins and dives!!! 5 stars people!!!"}
{"text":"i've had a few dishes here...the veggie curries hit the spot for me...but the one dish that sticks out in my memory is the seafood panang. even though i am put off by the textures of  some sea creatures (especially squid and mussels), i love this dish. the sauce is savory, spicy, sweet, and rich. the assortment of seafood in this panang consists of salmon, scallops, mussels, and squid.  the salmon pairs quite well with panang sauce, as do the tender scallops. the mussels taste wonderful in this dish despite their graphic texture...the squid is rubbery and i can't recall a time when i've not eaten rubbery squid. is there a way to make its texture more palatable?...despite the squid, i probably order wild thaiger's seafood panang once a month when i can afford to do so and when i am craving a protein rich meal. 

the veggie spring rolls here are okay, but not amazing. the thai iced tea is standard, which is good. the tom yum (or was it tom kah?) soup was unique as it had a sharper flavor than i'm used to--more spices seemed to be used, and it tasted fresher than some of the thai soup i've had in other thai places. 

overall, i have to say i love this restaurant when i'm in the mood for thai."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the service impeccable. Very attentive and knowledgeable server. Appetizers were amazing. Loved the cucumber based side sauce for the satay!"}
{"text":"I would have given this place a 5 star rating, but I had to take a star away for the lack of service. We waited approximately 15 minutes just for water. The food here is really good and has great flavor. If you know good Thai food this is the place for you. I will come back again, but will go with the take out option instead."}
{"text":"I am wavering between three and four stars.  The food here is good, the drink menu is extensive (which is always a must for me), and the scene was pretty good.... 
I just moved from San Francisco, where the Thai food is cheap and amazing, very authentic, and spicy.  So, in comparison, this is just okay.  They didn't have a lot of curries on the menu, and the dishes were HUGE.  I prefer to pay a little less, and have a good amount of food.  I guess that if you were eating \"family style\" it might be more appropriate.  I think that I would go back and give it another chance."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner on the patio - I had the Pad Cha Seafood dish rated \"Thai hot\" - the so-called hottest dish on the menu.  The person I was with ordered the ginger fish - mediocre at best, although it looked great with a variety of vegetables and pineapple.  I felt the dishes looked better than they actually tasted.  The seafood (mussels, calamari, salmon, shrimp) in my dish was very fresh but it wasn't Thai hot at all.  The ambiance of their patio was enjoyable and the Thai iced tea was very tasty although a little too sweet towards the end.  Overall, I will probably give this restaurant another try in the future but I wasn't very impressed with the taste of the food."}
{"text":"I had a surprising lunch at the Thaiger.  Received a royal welcome from a singularly beautiful Thai woman, sit where you want, move chairs to be more comfortable, we are so glad you are here etc etc.  Then nothing.

Maybe it was our fault as we chose outside on a cloudy cool day.  After no response, I went in ordered food.  Food was delivered 45 minutes later.  Didn't have a complete place setting and they never returned so I trudge back inside and so it went.

Then adding insult to injury the food was bland when it arrived.  Why ask about spice levels?  Another trip to the bar for some peppers.  They gave me chopped serrano peppers so I can only conclude the kitchen was not attentive to our choices.

We chose WT based on Yelp reviews and have to say it looked like they would know Thai food and maybe on a different day the experience would be better.   However, on our visit, we were treated as intrusions instead of guests and are not likely to be back.  Not worth the time or money solid 2 stars.

{"text":"I suppose you shouldn't judge a restaurant based on a lunch rush experience, but such is what I have to work with and I doubt I will be back. Less because the \"15 minute\" wait took an hour, more because the food is too bland to suit me.

Thai food is spicy. Notoriously so - or at least it should be. I was excited that they would prepare their Pad Thai (a dish that serves as a very good baseline to judge everything else served in these places) \"Thai hot,\" despite it not having the associated chili icon next to it on the menu indicating that this was an available option. I love Pad Thai. I love it hot! Bring it on!

Well, there were chilis on the plate that were not on my companion's, so it certainly looked like they tried - but there was just no heat here, man. You don't have to make me sweat my balls off but come on - don't call this Thai hot! It was actually delicious but \"tasty\" Thai food without any noticeable spice is not what I call Thai food. It's Asian-American food and I can get that for way cheaper than this. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, they cater to the white bread Central corridor. Those guys consider Macayo's to be authentic Mexican.

For my Thai jones, I'm sticking with Siam Thai."}
{"text":"I've been there twice and I have been happy both times.
The hardest thing to convey to the waitress is that YES, I do want it Thai hot.
Other than that and a small dining area (our \"cold\" winter nights are still doable on the patio, though), the experience is quality. Good food, well presented. Even my vegetarian friends were happy."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Service was great and food was even better. The presentation of the food was outstanding. Guy from diners drive ins and dives food network show did this place justice. If you are visiting Phoenix you must stop in and eat. 

Peace and love"}
{"text":"Wild Thaiger is hands down the best Thai food in the whole valley. I've been coming here since 2004 and it has been consistently amazing since the beginning. They have my favorite spring rolls (usually I get veggie), and that's out of any Asian restaurant I've been to, Thai, Chinese, Cambodian, whatever. Their curries are on point, not soupy like most places. I usually get the beef waterfall salad but everything I've gotten here has been great. It is so, so good!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food! I personally like spicy food and for me the green curry beef had just the right amount of spice and great taste even the tea was delicious. When I am on the area I gladly have lunch there again."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to stop by and get take out since we had been wanting to try it out. They were very busy on a Saturday night which was to be expected. They asked us if it was okay to wait 30 minutes for take out and we were fine since they were busy and we didn't call before arriving.!As far as the customer service the woman was friendly  until we declined to purchase drinks while we waited. We ended up waiting an hour before our order was ready. Which is pretty ridiculous. During the hour we waited we were not offered water or even acknowledged by the waitress to let us know how much longer until our food was ready. We ordered the pad Thai it was pretty decent. I enjoyed the food it wasn't great. We will probably give them another try but order ahead of time."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been frequenting Wild Thaiger for a few years. We have done both dine in and take out. Usually with a great experience. However in the last few months the service has deteriorated. Long wait times for a server to pay any attention to you making every meal feel long and drawn out. On our most recent visit this evening it took forever to be acknowledged when we walked in. After we were sat it took another 10 minutes before our server came over. Other than the slow service the food runner/ bus girl with a bad attitude had her pants riding so low that at first we could see her butt crack, later she was flaunting her thong. I'm pretty sure if I wanted a strip tease I would have gone to bandaids down the street, not wild Thaiger."}
{"text":"Wild Thaiger used to be my go to place for Thai food. The Pad Thai is decent (not the best I have ever had... but it is the best I have found in Phoenix). Be warned however that you will not be able to order a carryout if they are busy! I called to order a carryout tonight but was told that they could not take my order because there was an hour wait for a table in the restaurant. I have never heard of a restaurant not taking a to go order because of an in house wait. I have never eaten in the restaurant and in the past I have always been able to order to go without a problem. I will likely no longer patronize this establishment."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night and there were plenty of tables available. After a 20 minute wait we were finally seated in one of the many open tables throughout the restaurant. Seems like they were trying to not overwhelm the kitchen and were pretty short staffed. 

Our drink order took extremely long and when it arrived it brought obviously skunky beer. The tea was fruity and delicious. 

Dragon Eggs were very dense and we couldn't detect any crab, but the sauce made it delicious. Can't complain about the Chicken Pad Thai because it was great. 

Overall, the food was mostly good and the service was horrendous enough to not to go back. We will be looking for our Thai food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Sucks. Very bland Americanized \"thai\". My food had HAIR in IT. Presentation is nice. Cocktails are ok. Food is ultra bland and nothing like real thai food ala thai town los angeles. Boring over priced. I had a \"ginger\" fish. That was ultra fried no flavor. Where's the ginger? Tasted like fast food fish. Literally topped and seasoned with nothing. Pad thai ultra bland even though we got spicy.  Wheres the fried egg and shallots that pad thai is supposed to have? And the shrimp tasted frozen and over done. Lack luster. Tasted like microwave frozen pad thai. But it was pretty. That was its selling pointing. Never again. 70+ for meal that tasted like 10. Ultra disappointed. Had i never had an authentic thai dish i might think this place was interested. Considering the low quality of food and the ultra wait.  Not worth your money. Find a thai place that actually caters to thai people. Lame. Bland. Ultra disappointing. Never again. My companion from the east coast was also ultra disappointed. He had never had such poor bland thai food. And both of us loooove thai food. So let down to say the least. :/"}
{"text":"I've only been to the Wild Thaiger once, but I enjoyed the food and would go again. I went with two friends and we all enjoyed our meals. The vegetarian selection on the menu is limited, but what is available is delicious. The service is friendly and relatively quick (it was busy when we were there). Great iced green tea!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here. Saw the place on Triple D and that's what brought me in. Sometimes having them in wrecks a place. Not here. Food and service was great. Had the Dragon Eggs and the Beef Waterfall salad. Bother we're delicious.  The salad want traditional Thai but a modern interpretation and it worked. 

Matty approved!"}
{"text":"When back twice and the service was excellent both times and the pad thai is still pretty tasty, but still too much chicken in it."}
{"text":"Yellow curry with chicken:  I dream about this!
Peanut chicken:  fabulous, with more flavor than is imaginable.
Basil chicken:  I think the official name is something else but this is incredibly, memorably good.

Lunch specials are wonderful, but I'm usually there for dinner.  Great service and consistently good Thai food.  Of all the Thai restaurants in town (and I like many of them), this is my FAVE"}
{"text":"Quick service, great food at a very reasonable price. Great place for a lunch break from work. Also have a nice patio to eat on."}
{"text":"Wow, just realized my reviews were never finished... So, this is from a year ago at Thanksgiving.  Haven't been back, but would definitely try it again.
*************
We just returned from a delish meal at Wild Thaiger, after reading all the great reviews.  I'm happy to say it didn't disappoint!  We had appetizers as well as dinner, and everything was sooooooooo tasty!  The presentation was pleasing, the portions outrageously large, and the service exceptional.  Granted, we did have the place pretty much to ourselves (being the day before Thanksgiving...).  Still, it was a great experience.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I feel like 3 stars is generous. 
The service is horrible- just awful. We got there when they were really busy, and so accepted the 30 minute wait easily. We asked to sit outside (plenty of tables). After 45 minutes, they tell us they have a table inside for us. We remind them we wanted outside- another 15 minutes to wait. By now the place was not budy-- maybe like five other tables. 
Once we are at the table, it takes 20 minutes to get water served. The waiter got two drink orders wrong. 

We waited. And waited. No explanation, no apology.
After AN HOUR sitting at the table, our food is finally delivered. My vegetarian meal had meat in it. Two of the meals had no serving usensils. 

To top it all off, the food was just okay. I've had worse, but definitely not worth the 2.5 hours."}
{"text":"THAI ICED TEA WITH BOBA!!!!!!!

First time going was last Thursday. Food, atmosphere, and service were all excellent. 
I haven't had too much experience with Thai food, but we thought their Pad Thai, and Red Curry dish (vegetarian) was very good.
The owner, Ola, is a very nice, pleasant, and humble person.

Another shout out for their Thai Iced Tea WITH boba! I've been craving this ever since!!
We also had their homemade mango cheesecake. It was amazing especially with the mango sauce drizzled on top."}
{"text":"I have been craving Wild Thaiger for a year now (last time I was in town they were closed). The flavors are perfectly blended, the food is artistic, and the food choices are unlike that I've seen at two other Thai restaurants I've eaten at recently. Their Thai Iced Tea has to be some of the best I've tasted thus far. Its typically quiet which was perfect for girl's day out and chatting."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic! I left a previous review from my first visit a few months ago and it was 5 stars, and after going there again last night it's still 5 stars and I wish I could give them 10 stars! The service is great and the food is amazing! The Thai tea is a must!"}
{"text":"While I am still on the hunt for my favorite Thai place in the valley, Wild Thaiger is on the top of my list so far. I went there first 4 years ago on mothers day. The service was  Green Papaya salad is fresh, full of flavor and has several large flavorful shrimp. Yum. My other favorites are Holy Basil and Pad Thai. Always consistent and delicious. They offer a nice kids dish with chicken and a plum sauce that is very simple and good. and I love their iced green tea!"}
{"text":"Wow... Loved this place.  When I walked in and saw the menu, I didn't know what to get.  I've had some great Thai food in California so I was craving something good.

I really wanted a shrimp entree, but they only had seafood entrees.  I asked our waiter, Nathan, who was very pleasant, and he had a great suggestion.  He was able to customize a dish for me that I loved.  Fried shrimp with yellow curry, Thai vegetables, and jasmine rice.  He called it Crispy SH M.K.  No idea what that means but when I return that's how I'm supposed to order it.  The vegetables consisted of eggplant, Thai pumpkin, and green beans.  It was spicy, but I loved it.

For an appetizer, we had the satay sampler with shrimp, beef, and chicken. The satay sauce was delicious.  And, of course, a glass of Thai iced tea.

Prices were very reasonable and the portions were large - about $45 for two entrees, drinks, and an appetizer.  Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"This place has been my favorite for many years. Excellent service, food, and atmosphere. 

I have ate at many Thai restaurants both in the Valley and in CA. This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"This is a review that has been delayed for awhile.

I am from LA in California & let me say that I tried a lot of Thai food due to vast Thai restaurants available in LA. This restaurant by far have the best Thai food I have ever had."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place more stars but there are some factors that prevent that. Went to have dinner with my bestie from HS. Both of us had this place in the \"To Do\" list. The wait when we got there was normal but there's no real waiting area. The hostess said we can wait at the bar but there was no bartender. That was a little weird. 

There's an open kitchen which I enjoy. Watching them prepare all the dishes made me want to try everything that came out of it. 

Waitress came to the table quickly to take drink orders. She didn't offer or suggest appetizers. And once we ordered our food it took a long time for it to come out. Normally I don't make a big deal out of it but the place is very small and they weren't busy. 

God was delicious though. Very flavorful and smelled great. I got the Chicken Curry. My friend got the Temple of Fire and we shared Tropical rice with chicken and beef. Im not big on spice and the Temple of Fire is pretty dam spicy. It looked so good I had to try it and I was pissed I did."}
{"text":"The food was okay and the atmosphere was nice. Unfortunately the service was absolutely appalling. It took 30 minutes just for the waitress to take our drink order and another 30 for her to take our food order. She took even longer to collect the bill and run our card. We could see her chatting behind the counter with another employee. My boyfriend had to walk up to the counter to ask her to run our card as we had been waiting for so long. Considering there was only one other table in the whole restaurant this was ridiculous. Extremely disappointed with my experience and I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Pros: food is pretty good.

Cons:  they rarely pick up the phone for to go orders. The one order we were able to place (after several tries) was messed up and we had to wait for them to fix it.  

Terrible service, decent food.  You decide which is more important.  For me, there are plenty of better thai places in the area."}
{"text":"This is a tough review to make.  I've heard nothing but great things about this place,  and the moment we walked in we were instantly turned off by the hostess.  We were asked if we would like to sit outside (mind you its 50 outside) and when we said no she said that they do not have anything else available.  I looked around and saw 4 tables open a couple with a \"section closed\" sign on them.  She then asked if you want to sit inside there is a wait.  I asked how long she said 15 min,  I said no problem.  She said if we want we can wait at the bar.  We went to the bar to find 2 half full drinks and employee clothing and rubber gloves laying on the seats so we sat at a high top.   Literally 3 min later the hostess comes up and says do you guys just want to sit here and eat?  Again I said no we would like a table,  so she went and got menus right away took off one of the \"section closed\"signs in a booth and sat us.   

I could keep writing about the extremely poor service that nearly made us walk out but I will save you all time.   At the end of it all the food was amazing and is the only thing that kept us there.  

The corn fritters were great, tofu with peanut sauce was amazing,  the satay sampler was my favorite,  and the pad Thai was ok.  

I would definitely eat the food again,  but maybe next time I'll do take out.  I do not think I will ever attend the restaurant again"}
{"text":"The Pad Thai Tofu with Vegetables was so delicious and generous in portion size. I am so glad my husband and I decided to eat here. After trying many other Thai restaurants in the area it's nice to find one that knows how to actually make the dish. Awesome food, terrific service and a overall wonderfully satisfying experience!"}
{"text":"Not a HUGE fan of Thai but when you're invited to a free lunch, ya go! Atmosphere was chill with a good vibe but the concrete floors, wood and plaster walls make it a challenge to have a normal business convo much less an intimate chat. However, the food is delicious, well-seasoned and pretty quick for a lunch offering. The owner is very friendly and you can tell he takes great pride in his eatery...Wild Thaiger is good eats!!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food!  One dish was too spicy. They immediately took it back and fixed it. The Tom Ga Kai was very good. They have this rated with '$$' but the quality exceeded the price!"}
{"text":"Omg... the waitress was so rude and illmannered. Food no complaints. We signed the check and expected to put cash in for the tip. The waitress expected us to add the tip into the bill and expected more tip from us. It was an upfront shameless demand that we should pay more or should not be coming to the restaurant to be seated. Never ever visiting this restaurant where the service are so shameless in asking a customer for more tip. When we told her that we wont be returning back to the restaurant '' the waitress told us ''thank you please dont''. Came in on 12/12 for lunch."}
{"text":"Great food and the service is some of the best! We ordered the papaya salad and the crab island as starters and it was on point! 

The papaya salad was not too spicy, but enough where it's still very refreshing. 

The crab is like a chilled crab dip with avocado on a chip. Good savory appetizer that is great to share, & comes with 4 total. 

The Tom Yum Goong was amazing and we were able to share it amongst everyone. Not even a drop of soup was left! 

Besides the food, the service is really outstanding and even the owner came out to see how we were doing. If you are looking for a really great asian restaurant and you can handle just a bit of spice make it a mission to come to this place! The staff is very welcoming and knowledgeable about the menu to help find the perfect dish for you."}
{"text":"I have a favorite Thai place near my home but I wanted to venture out. What a great find in W.T!! I had the 24k which was delicious but very HOT! So I changed plates with my Sister who had gotten the satay. My mouth burned for a while but the Thai tea calmed it down some. They cannot change the heat level of the 24k, which was disappointing but understandable. My daughter got the curry chicken, it was lovely! 
We were so full that we passed up the sticky rice with Mango. So I guess we have to go back. Fine with me!!"}
{"text":"I have only gone for lunch. The chicken Pad Thai is good. The sweet candy shrimp is good, but pricey. The staff seems to be in a hurry and give you a quick hi and a smile. They don't seem to be very attentive. You may be seated right away, but it will take awhile to be waited on and receive your food or asked if there is anything you need. The place is always hot and uncomfortable. Unfortunately, the food is good enough and is conveniently located to work, that the probability of me returning is pretty high. The place can get crowded during lunch which is understandable being in central Phoenix."}
{"text":"Wild Thaiger was very cozy and inviting. This was my first time eating Thai food so I was looking to have a great experience unfortunately the service or lack there of almost ruined it for me. They were not very busy but it took about 10 minutes for the hostess to seat us. The server took another 15 minutes to take our drink order. The Thai iced tea was really different but very good. We ordered some chicken egg rolls and when they finally came or they were amazing! Our main dishes took forever to come out and it was just ok. I think I like Thai food.but I will not be returning here."}
{"text":"Because of a convenient location, my go to Thai restaurant is Thai Basil.  However, I was able to try Wild Thaiger since I was in the area earlier this week.  Very, very flavorful Thai food.  I thought it was excellent and yummy.  It was hard to compete against my standard option of Thai Basil, but lately the flavors at Thai Basil haven't been as great as it used to be (must be new cooks?).  

Anyways, if you are ever in the Phoenix downtown area, definitely hit up this spot.  Great thai lunch for reasonable prices.  I was able to have leftovers for lunch the next day.  And their thai iced tea was potent, but very, very delish."}
{"text":"OH-MY-GOD! So good! had their chicken curry, and one of those big soups! Was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Bland, blech, barf. 

That's pretty much how I feel about Wild Thaiger. The food here is the farthest thing from authentic as it could get without venturing into Lean Cuisine territory. I suppose, though, it was the closest us downtowners had to real Thai, until Thai Hut and Thai Elephant moved in. (You are on notice, Wild Thaiger!) 

I think I gave it a fair shake. I ate here a total of four times, with different people and different food. I was not impressed once. In fact, I was pretty disgusted twice to find a long black hair weaving itself through my molded mound of rice. 

No spice. No life. No business from me."}
{"text":"Yet another phenomenal meal. Had the Dragon Eggz which were tangy as ever. Also tried the Turtle Island Crab, which is literally a deconstructed won ton. Just brilliant. And the perfect thing to have during the awful Phoenix summer!

For dinner I ordered the Temple of Fire, and they weren't joking. It would be nice if they wouldn't pound the chicken flat as a pancake, though! Cook the whole thing and cut it up, instead! Pounding a chicken flat makes it tough. 

The service was stellar as always. Our server was cheerful, and on point."}
{"text":"I love Wild Thaiger.  I only gave it 4 stars because the service can be hit or miss.  Lately it has been a great experience (yay).  I love their hot and sour chicken soup and their Tofu Towers (awesome).  Another favorite of mine is their yellow curry tofu lunch special.  Give it a try and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! I love when I find small business gems like this that are making delicious food. The staff is very nice and everything was so good!"}
{"text":"I heard of Wild Thaiger from diners, drive-ins, and dives and I am a huge Thai food fan, so was pleased to see a restaurant with such great reviews! I went on a Saturday night around 8:00 and only had about a 15 minute wait. We ordered the steamed dragon eggs as an appetizer and loved them! The cilantro and jalapeño slice on top really took it to another level worth the sweetness of the sauce. Then my husband and I shared the Kimow noodle plate. It was delicious, but I would ask them to add a little more heat next time. It was supposed to be slightly spicy, but didn't have much heat to it. Other Han that the plate was delicious and perfect to split with an appetizer! We will definitely be going back to try the coconut ice cream and hot pots."}
{"text":"Eeeeee. Long yet important message to follow!!

If I was blind and If this place gave me the ability to see again.... Eeeeeehhhh I still wouldn't go back.

The first time I went, a few years back it was good. Good food! Then got take out and yeah, just well cooked good food. Nothing to write home about but still good. 

This time... Wild tiger turned into wild sloth. Arguably just as cool in animal comparison but the tiger could, if he so chose to, rip apart the sloth with vigor. 

The hostess was hard to find and inattentive. Se really wasn't present or rememberable. We sat down and ordered. Waters came out. Then our app. It was some roll thingy. It tasted like frozen shrimp wrapped in rice paper for 9 bux. Oh oh oh it tasted like the rolls you get at the sushi place in Safeway. Yea no thanks. Plus the waiter seemed to disappear. A while later the food was delivered. Hhmm. Pad Thai you say? Uh nope! Well if you call over cooked noodles shoved under a huge pile of cabbage pad Thai the yeaaa.. I guess. 
Curry you say.... Hmmm nope just over spiced over cooked and tasteless except for the over spice thing.., which is just down right confusing. 

The waiter never came back to check on us. My lady dropped her eating utensil on the ground and I went inside to get another. Standing at the empty hostess station looking around....looking....still looking....oh oh hey  hostess can I have a.. She cuts me off. \"I'll be back\" denied!!!! By the drive by host from a terminator movie. 
Well waiting still. Find someone. Utensils. Cool. Thanks. Sorry to be a bother as a paying customer.   
Then I sit back down. Take a few bites and realize everything tastes the same. Cold, over cooked and over spiced. 
So in effort to try to salvage this meal I try to ask for some limes. Guess what... Shocker..... It took me getting up to find someone. Cool got em. Cool, great, not real limes. Just little ones, like the ones you use for Mexican food!! Wtf!!! 

Anyways. Forcing it down cuz I'm sick of the search party of two game that they have thrust upon us, the waiter still never came back. The lady bussing the tables cleared our stuff except for the untouched pad Thai. We actually tipped the bus lady she was nice and a very hard worker.

Still
Wait
Ing

Oh wait I forgot the rules of the game.... I got up to search for the check. Yeaaaa! At what point do I win? And really what could the prize be?   Oh nothing. I guess you could say I win by not ever having to go back there. 

Sad really. Was a good place. I understand running a place like this has challenges but no care was shown from beginning to end about the customer experience. Oh well except for the bus lady she was cool.... Maybe she should own the place? Winning! 

And I'm out!"}
{"text":"Wild Thaiger was exactly what I needed today!  The Ginger Chicken lunch with a very tasty spring roll made me feel nourished and healthy in the best way.  My two companions had never eaten Thai food, and both declared it delicious.  I need to go back to try the Chicken Pad Thai that my friend liked.   My only suggestion is I needed to be given a spoon so I could enjoy every drop of my ginger sauce.  The perfect mango cheesecake I ordered inspired my friends to get their own slice.  The service was excellent especially since she helped my friends get a proper introduction to Thai food.  Parking behind the restaurant was available at lunchtime.  The bill for the three of us was less than $35.  I wish I lived closer as I need to try more on menu."}
{"text":"Good service but the food was only okay.  We tried a variety of things and none were awesome."}
{"text":"Finally, I had a chance to try the Pad Thai. This is the best I've ever had: loaded with lots of sauce, so very peanutty, sweet and salty at the same time. And it had tons of fresh bean sprouts, cabbage, and cilantro that is great when mixed in with the hot noodles. I will definitely order this dish again, but just wished that there were more than just 2 shrimp in it."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service, very friendly staff. 

Have dined here many times and have never been disappointed. The corn fritter appetizer is a real treat and should not be missed. 

The food is just a notch below the Siam Orchid in Gilbert, but very good nonetheless."}
{"text":"It was Friday night and fairly busy, so the service was understandably a little slow, but the two stars are for the food. I ordered the pad see ew (drunken noodles) with tofu, which is my go-to Thai dish. It was super greasy, to the point of being almost inedible. I was very hungry, so I ate enough to stave off my hunger, but did not finish it or even consider eating the leftovers. Won't be back."}
{"text":"The place was packed with people which is always a good sign; though there were many people my party of 8 was still seated quickly. Very friendly and attentive wait staff; nice ambience, great food!  I recommend the spicy chicken pad Thai; a tasty appetizer is the dragon pork w/jalapeño; when visiting Phoenix again I will definitely be stopping by for another fantastic Thai dinner."}
{"text":"Superb service, cute waitresses, and excellent green curry earn this moderately upscale Thai resto 4 stars from me."}
{"text":"Ive only been here once for dinner but I go alot for lunch, I work in the area. Its always fast, sometimes gets a little busy but Ive always been able to eat and get back to work in an hour. I usually get the yellow curry or pad thai. Its good food. Not spectacular thai by any means."}
{"text":"i was looking forward to a papaya salad when i walked into this place and was sorely disappointed. i didn't get sick or anything, it was just meh."}
{"text":"The food is very very good! The RIBS though...delicious, tender, sweet and just so so so good! A must try place!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from the Pacific Northwest, so I'm really picky about Asian food.  Wild Thaiger is fantastic, mostly authentic, Thai food.  For the less adventurous, the pad thai is delicious and unlike what you get at most Thai restaurants in the valley.  For those with a more adventurous palate, the Pad Cha seafood dish is spectacular.  Be careful if you order Thai hot..they mean business here.  The desserts are also fantastic.  For the best service, check it out for lunch on a weekday.  Service can be a little slow for dinner, but still good."}
{"text":"Solid Thai food, especially the Penang Beef.  They also had some good sangria.  Only complaint is the rice - it's always over-cooked."}
{"text":"Service was terrible! We drove 2 hours from Sedona to eat here. Total of 21 people together. The first 10 people arrived and were not seated and was told that all the parties needed to be present.  Waited 45-60 mins standing outside until the rest of the group arrived. Finally when the rest of the group arrived the Mngr then said we have to wait a lot longer and needed to be seated by groups, \"broken up\" since there were too many of us. There were only few people inside. The kitchen could not handle the large numbers all at one time per mngr, though there were enough empty tables for all of us. It did not make any sense why we cannot order our food  while waiting for the rest of the group to arrived. Once we're all there, She will not seat us because  our group was \" too large\"! Where is the LOGIC here? We ended up leaving and discovered CheryBlossomsCafe not too far from this place which was Awesome! Combination of Japanese/Thai&Korean food.All 21 of us enjoyed the food @ CherryBlossomsCafe and will NEVER go back nor recommend Wild Thaiger!"}
{"text":"Hit and miss, these days. 3 stars on the food these days, every other category they do great.

They used to be a solid 5 star Thai source back when they opened, but now about half the food is really really good and the other half is not really good. Their Pad Thai used to be the best ever by a fair bit, now it is just sweet and doesn't even have peanuts on it (last couple of trips at least). The barbecue was OK, but the green chile dipping sauce it came with was exceptional.

Still AWESOME - - Beef Panang, Pad Kee Mau (spicy coconut milk chicken soup). All their curries have been awesome to my memory. I used to take joy in trying new things here, now I am more cautious.

I hear there is a Scottsdale location now, but I think I will stick with the original."}
{"text":"I always eat here, since A) the food is great, B) it's super close, and C) the wait staff is really friendly.  I've never had bad service here, and I come all the time.  Although, maybe that's why I get good service, because I come all the time. :)  I must admit, though, I only rotate through maybe four dishes on the menu.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it."}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience. The service was superb and the food delicious!  The curry had the best flavor of any I've had. The pork skewers were so tender and uniquely seasoned. The dragon eggz were so tasty!  Finished with the mango cheesecake. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night. The wait was reasonable, at least from an east coast point of view, 18 min, but I heard a few impatient comments from those around me. regional standards must apply. Table service was a bit slow, and she forgot to bring the appetizers that she had herself recommended. I reminded her after our entrees appeared, so they comp'd them reasonable. The Salmon was overcooked and dry, but the chicken dish was good. Seasoning seemed a bit light, the other flavors need to come through the heat. Drink refills were greatly delayed and resulted in lost sales for them and frustration for us.
Over all, good food at an elevated price with moderate service. I would go back, but at off peak times to see if it is just volume which stresses the team there."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  The papaya salad was fantastic.  I ordered a Chicken Pad Thai which was so delicious.  And my co-worker ordered the 24k green curry which was super tasty with the right amount of sweetness and spice.  Definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. The lettuce wraps had a strong chicken flavor but nothing else, no spiciness, no species, no nothing.

I ordered something called like peanut passion (I love peanut curry and peanut sauce) and I ordered it with soft tofu instead of chicken (I thought I would grow feathers if I had more chicken).

The flavor was OK but I already forgot it.

What I liked the most, they have parking, they have a great patio (I guess October through March would be a nice place to be) and the Arnold Palmer with the green tea.

The prices are fair.

My verdict: Good for a quick bite if you're in the area and don't know what to eat."}
{"text":"Went to Wild Thaiger for the first time last night and enjoyed every aspect.  Had the Wild Wrap and Dragon Eggs for appetizers.  Both had a really good bite to them without losing all of the different flavors in the dish.  That is something that gets lost at many Thai places, everything is so hot you lose the flavor.  Two of us had the Beef Panang for dinner and our friend had the Salmon dish.  All were prepared very well.  The beef panang was a little different than I have had at many places here in town.  More curry & creamy coconut milk than the light broth based panang we have settled for at other places.  It was by far the best panang we have in Phoenix to date.  The beef was fork tender and the sauce flavor was over the top.  

The restaurant is very cozy and energetic.  It was 7:30 on a Thursday night and the inside was full, with only 1 table on the patio brave enough to weather the 100 degree heat.  Server was very friendly and attentive.  NA beverages were always kept full and she was all over refilling our glasses from the bottle of wine that had been ordered.  Big bonus points for the kitchen design.  It will not blow you away with tons of polished stainless steel and creative wall decor, but it is an open exhibition kitchen with about 10-12 seats at the bar that look in on the action.  Extremely rare to find in a Thai concept.  Love knowing who is cooking your food and that the kitchen is well kept.  We will definitely be back as this will be our new home for Thai in the valley."}
{"text":"Having just moved apartments and being too lazy to take my dishes out of a box which was stacked under 6 more boxes (hey, I'm tired), I decided to head out for the the late afternoon/evening to explore the 'hood and end with a good bite to eat. Sure, I moved less than a mile from where I used to live, but anyway...

After running around doing a bunch of stuff, I thought about grabbing some Thai food. I've driven by Wild Thaiger a number of times but hadn't eaten there yet. So, today was the day.

Given that I was dining solo tonight, I brought a book to read. I went in and the place was packed. I told the hostess I'd rather sit outside on the patio since it was more quiet. So I sat around and waited for a while as I was listening to, well, Arabic pop music wafting through the speakers (don't get me wrong, I like Arabic music a lot, but at a Thai restaurant?). 5 minutes later the hostess came back out with my water. But it was10 minutes after that which my server finally showed up. Strike number one.

I ordered the Wild Wrap (spicy diced chicken that you eat by rolling it up in cabbage leaves) and the Holy Basil Chicken. About 15 minutes later the appetizer came. The server then promptly left without giving me any napkin or other utensils. Strike two. 

I walked back inside and flagged down a different waitress to ask for napkins. She looked at me funny. I told her, \"Hey, the other guy didn't give me any napkins, what can you do?\" 

So I ate the Wild Wrap. Not so great. I've had much better elsewhere (namely San Francisco). Still edible, but I wasn't really enjoying it. 10 minutes later the waiter came with the holy basil chicken. 

\"You don't have any utensils?\"

\"No, you didn't give me any.\"

\"Oh.\"

So instead of the paper napkin the other waitress gave me, I finally get a cloth napkin with a fork and knife. I'm now sitting hoping the dish is going to be worth all this waiting and extraneous trouble.

It wasn't. 

The sauce was alright, I guess, but the chicken pieces were dry and I'd give the whole dish just 3 stars. Throughout this entire time no one came outside once to check on how I was doing or to refill my water. I was beginning to get bad flashbacks to my Autumn Court experience. Strike three. Wild Thaiger was out.

5 minutes after I finished the waitress came out to refill my water (um, I'm done) and told me she'd go get my check. No \"Would you like dessert?\" because apparently single guys with books don't eat dessert. The waiter comes out 5 minutes later with the bill and gives a super friendly thank you. Uh, thanks for being nice and all now, but this is the first time I've seen you since you put the plate on my table. 

I don't know if because I brought a book with me that these people summed up that \"he must be a lousy tipper so we don't need to pay much attention to him.\" WRONG. I'm a great tipper if and when I get good service. For whichever reason I was ignored, though, my tip's going to reflect that.

As is my Yelp review. 

SUMMARY: Food was ok. Not all too special. I've had better Thai food with a lot more choices on the menu at other restaurants in the Phoenix metro. Regardless of the food, the service wasn't a winner. Maybe I should wear an Armani suit next time around."}
{"text":"I have had some good digestive experiences here. 

Also, I have kin who works here... so that's another incentive for you to step in."}
{"text":"I love Thai Food! I could eat it every day and never get tired of it! I have this week been giving several a try to do reviews on them.
The Wild Thaiger is still my Number one Favorite.
The food is divine here. It is always fresh, they cook it when you come in. It is never pre made. Even when they are busy ,the customer service is very good.
I love every thing I have ever tried here. Fresh and Delicious, and it smells wonderful inside. With all the lovely spices and such.
Parking is in the back, and if you cannot find it, it is right next door to Durant's. Another great place. But, that is another story."}
{"text":"Eat the beef Panama or the sesame chicken (Wednesday specual) Good prices, made piping hot, and the waitresses are all super friendly"}
{"text":"Wild Thaiger celebrated its 10th year anniversary this weekend!  This is a neighborhood restaurarnt with first class food.  The chef and owner consistently refreshes the menu to great delight!  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We had our first experience on a Friday night about 6:30. The servers were pleasant.  Wild Thaiger has a nice patio dining facing Central, but it was a little too hot and they didn't have a misting system. The inside was clean with a combo bar and open kitchen. 

We started with the Freshie Rolls with warm Peanut Sauce and Lychee Martini. Nice, but not the best in town (Pure Sushi Bar has a to die for Lychee Lemon Drop).  

The entrees are huge and could easily be shared. We had the Kimow - hot and spicy clear noodles, chicken, broccoli, snow peas, sweet onion, Thai chili, garlic and sweet Thai Basil - Delicious!

To be fair, Thai is not one of my favorites, but we love to support local restaurants and this came highly recommended. Glad we tried it. 

And for those of you who like it HOT and SPICY - Wild Thaiger has you covered."}
{"text":"A year ago I wrote about our attempt to have dinner at the Wild Thaiger and the terrible experience we had with the hostess--We decided to try again--and what a difference!!! We were greeted warmly--even tho it was packed we were given our choice of available seating--very gracious hostess and wait staff. The food was fabulous--it was very loud but the atmosphere is congenial--. We love it and will go back soon to try different dishes..."}
{"text":"As someone who LOVES Thai food, I can really appreciate a good Pad Thai, and Wild Thaiger's is my favorite hands down!

Just like the menu says, their Pad Thai has a plethora of intense flavors, to the point where every bite is unique.  If you love Pad Thai and haven't tried Wild Thaiger's, you need to.  If you don't love Pad Thai, it's probably because you haven't tried Wild Thaiger's.  :)  Seriously, this is one of the best dishes I've found in Phoenix.

Their other dishes are consistently good as well.  I love Chicken Satay, but most places only offer it as an appetizer, with a few skimpy chicken strips.  Wild Thaiger, on the other hand, has a filling Peanut Chicken lunch, as well as a Peanut Passion dinner, both drenched in their delicious peanut sauce.  Their curries are very flavorful and make for a superb and hearty dinner, but if you're going for lunch, you may want to consider Thai Basil up the road as their curry lunch combo includes a salad and other extras.

Their Thai Tea is strong yet creamy, just like it should be, and you can even add boba to it.  A must if you're eating anything spicy.

The service is very professional and timely.  The atmosphere is pretty classy, in fact, it's probably the nicest-looking Thai restaurant I've been to.  It's also the only Thai restaurant I can think of with a patio.  All in all, it has a very welcoming atmosphere.  I would feel just as comfortable here in a suit as I would a T-shirt and jeans.  It's a great place for dates, business lunches, or just some great take-out.  You might spend a tad bit more here than at some other nearby joints, but the quality more than makes up for it, I would say the prices are spot-on.

One day I'll learn how to write a review that's short and sweet, but I kept thinking of good things to say about this place.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I went here when I was feeling a little under the weather and got the Super Soup. It was amazing! I got it spicy and it was most def really spicy! It was such a huge soup for 9$. I had one of my friends spring rolls which were one of the best I have ever eaten! I think its one of the best Thai places in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a place in Phoenix that was on DDD that completely blew my mind, and this place surely didn't wow me at all.  So my brother and I were in the area and wanted some good dinner.  We never been to this place, but heard about it in the past on DDD.  So we wanted to give this place a try and came in on a Thursday night.  I have seen some reviews in the past about the bad customer service and on this night it was no different.  It was pretty busy and I noticed they only had two waitress, a bus boy and hostess that tried to accommodate the entire place.  They were hustling and tried their best, but clearly they were overwhelmed.  I didn't know if someone call in or what, but two waitresses covering inside and outside seemed to be a pretty tough task. 

The food, cause that's what it's all about right?  Nothing really blew me away, honestly I have been to many places just as good, Sala Thai, Reign of Thai, and Thai Basil.  We ordered the Papaya salad, Pad Sie-ew, and full rack of Thaiger ribs.  The Papaya salad was small, but it was fresh and flavorful.  The Pad Sie-ew was ok, tasted like a Chinese style chow fun with vegetables.  The ribs I really wasn't a fan of.  They were braised and were completely falling off the bone.  I'm not a huge fan of that.  I think ribs should have a little bit and should hold up when you're eating it.  I took a bite of the rib and all the meat fell off.  Maybe cause I like ribs smoked, I just wasn't a fan.

Overall this place was just average.  Nothing special.  I know they were probably a little understaffed, but we never got our water or drinks refilled.  No one ever came by to check on us and we considered getting dessert, but it wasn't offered.  The food would have to been great for me to come back again.  Not a fan, probably will stick to the joints up north then venture down here again.

Maybe it was a off night, but a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Food was alright. Service was the worst I have ever experienced. I took almost two hours for us to receive our food. I haven't and will not go back. THAI HUT IS MUCH BETTER/CHEAPER/BETTER SERVICE!!"}
{"text":"BEST Thai food! They must teleport the food from Thailand because the meals here are amazing. The yellow curry chicken and pad Thai are full flavored meals needing no condiments added. The service is great but get there before the lunch rush as this place is full by noon."}
{"text":"Triple D location.  This Resturant got me interested via Guy Fiery. So let's go. Small separated building in the business corridor of Phoenix.  Small but comfortable inside, no tv's. Not too loud. The first course we're the dragon eggs, crunchy.  These were very good. Next course for me was the spicy basil chicken, the entrees were the ribs and the stay skewers. I must say everything was fabulous. Well worth the trip to get there. It is a must eat and a have to return to."}
{"text":"This place is so worth the stars, the drive, the good word from triple D's...whatever excuse you need to make to get here DO IT!

We enjoyed outdoor seating on the patio with the heaters and intimate lighting when we stopped in. We were serviced right away and found the service to continue at a high end all the way through.

I had the red curry chicken dish, I forget what the purple crisps were but in any case they were delicious, the portion was so much that I got two meals out of it. The curry was fantastic with just a slight kick and packed with flavor.

YUM"}
{"text":"I was so happy to see that they have yellow curry-- and even more pleasantly surprised that it had a really authentic flavor, as someone who is used to Southeast Asian yellow curries rather than the more typical red or green! It was not too spicy but nowhere near bland. So so satisfying.

The Peanut Chicken is also excellent. Tender chicken drenched in peanut sauce, you can't really go wrong here.

As for noodle dishes, the Pad Thai is of course a go-to for most people. Whether you want to stick with the classic or go the road less traveled, you won't be disappointed here. The Pad Thai is heaping with veggies and meat, and is extremely flavorful.

Exercise caution when ordering something spicy, because the levels of spicy can significantly vary by day! Also, one star off for the spotty/slow service at both the Phoenix and Scottsdale locations, but other than tha, really worth the stop!"}
{"text":"Definite best place for Thai in Phoenix. They may have a few beat but not my most favorite. They have some nice dishes here very unique and Steven Seagals picture in the back is classic :) 

I'm into more staple Thai food like coconut curries, Phad Thai, maybe a few other stir fry dishes but I always start with the staple item when trying new Thai places. This place has many unique dishes so try them all :)"}
{"text":"To wait is one thing. To wait an hour before an appetizer even arrives at the table for two of us is crazy. The busboy came by to ask how our dinner was and our appetizer had not even come out. He said something to one of the waitresses possibly even the owner and she yelled at him. Food is good but experience was not. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Great food, but they don't answer the phone very often. If you can get through, they have amazing yellow curry and corn fritters."}
{"text":"Oh Wild Thaiger, how I do love thee! Actually, to be more specific, how I do love pad thai. 

I hadn't been to Wild Thaiger in a while because I hate navigating around Central Avenue these days, but it was my co-worker's birthday and she wanted Wild Thaiger. I'm so so glad we went there, and I was double happy this afternoon when I ate my leftovers for lunch. The best thing about the pad thai at Wild Thaiger (besides that it is so good) is that there is so much I always have lunch the next day ( which is just lovely). 

A note for those south of McDowell trying to get to Wild Thaiger: Drive up 3rd Street and turn left on Roanoke. You'll dead end into a strip mall parking lot. Park there and walk a few steps south to Wild Thaiger. Viola! 

I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 because I ordered a Coke and it tasted funny ... like way too soda-watery. When I told the waitress, she sort of shrugged and said, \"A lot of people say that.\" Yeah .... I had to ask, \"So, can I get something different please?\"

But my pathetic Coca Cola aside, it was a great lunch, and she even brought my co-worker toasted coconut ice cream in a coconut dish with a candle. How sweet!"}
{"text":"Amazing! We shared the Pad Thai, Holy Basil Chicken, the Papaya Salad, and Super Soup.  Thai hot is legit!"}
{"text":"Yummmm awesome thai food. Tried the pad see ew, pad thai, spring rolls, and red curry. All fantastic! Also loved the thai beers. We sat outside on the patio (no wait), which was way too hot, but that was our own fault...thank you Phoenix summers."}
{"text":"Visiting friends in the area and they had been meaning to try this place. I'm glad we were there! All of us agreed that it was a great experience - he's a chef so that is high praise! No complaints on anything we had. 

Wonderful food - creative, great flavors, artful presentation. 
Helpful waitstaff - with a shellfish allergy, navigating a Thai menu can be a challenge. She was knowledgeable and guided me to what I could have, what they could change, and what I couldn't have so I didn't have to worry about munching off of someone else's plate. 
Nice decor - tasteful, clean, well kept up.

Only suggestion would be for them to clean up the back door of the restaurant where the boxes / trash go as it is where their parking lot is and doesn't give a good first impression.

We had:
Satay Sampler - moist chicken, nicely done beef, and they put the prawns on the side. Peanut sauce was good - not peanut-buttery like some. 
Tom Ka Gai - so good, we took the leftover liquid home to use later.
Super Natural Salad - fresh, flavorful, and a large portion that 2 could easily share (we spread it around to 4)
Mi Dang - pork was amazing!
Holy Basil Chicken - I couldn't have this, but the chef loved it!
Chicken Curry - the benchmark of a good Thai place and this one passed with flying colors. 

Probably won't be back in the area for a few years, but will definitely make a stop when we are."}
{"text":"I used to go here once every two weeks for lunch with my coworkers.

It's extremely delicious Thai food, if slightly difficult to get a table if you are a group of 8 or more (understandable...) Pad thai + curries are excellent. Ambiance = extrememly fun. Hot sauce and peppers = extrememly available.

The drinks here are HIGHLY recommended. Lychee + Gin Martinis. YES YES YES YES YES. I'm not sure why I havent started making this at home. 

I had my union going away party here on the patio. So awesome in the fall and winter!

Oh also the staff is awesome. Not only are the waitresses EXTREMELY attractive but also very nice and always remembered our big gang of fools."}
{"text":"The more I think about our experience at this restaurant last night the fewer stars I'm able to apply. We arrived on time and had to wait for our table. Not that big of a deal except for our table sat empty for 15 to 20 minutes before they actually sat us at the table and the restaurant was not full. When they sat us, it was a good 15 minutes before anyone came over to us. It took us another 20 minutes to get water and once they finally took our order 3 appetizers came out along with the first person's dinner. There are 8 of us total and over the course of the next 15 minutes a dinner here and a dinner there came out. The 8th dinner came out when the rest of us were completely done. Our server thought the way to handle this was bt cracking jokes and buying a drink for that a person, not taking care of his dinner. Poorly handled from start to finish. And on top of it all the food was meh at best.  My first visit will definitely be my last and I won't recommend to the place to anyone ever. Too bad, because I've heard good things about this place. And for the record I post positive reviews regularly and negative reviews rarely."}
{"text":"Good spot if you're craving Thai! We started with the dragon eggz (half steamed, half fried) which were amazing! Then I ordered the Tom Ka Gai soup. Very flavorful and big enough to share! My boyfriend ordered the Beef Panang and the Chicken Pad Thai. Both were also very good. 
Only item that was a disappointment was the Thai Iced Tea. It was extremely sweet. I love Thai Iced Tea, but this was so sweet I unfortunately had to send it back. Not worth getting. Overall, very casual atmosphere with great prices and service!"}
{"text":"YUM! YUM! YUM!

We visited Wild Thaiger for my wife's birthday after she saw it featured on a TV program. Really yummy food that was presented well too. The wine list was a little obscure (we're sort of wine snobs!!) with no recognizable brands. However, my wife chose a Chilean Chardonnay and it was great.

Parking was a breeze with plenty of space behind the restaurant (that was free).

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"4.5 or maybe 4.6

Finally got to try Wild Thaiger. By what I have read and now I interpreted the menu, I thought it was just fancy schmancy version of my fave Thai dishes. Since I'm not one to mess with classics, I didn't know how I'd like this spot. Wifey told me that tonight was the Thai New Year and they were going to have live music and dancers, so I figured uck it why not. What an awesome meal.

We started with the veggie sampler ($12.95) as our appetizer and a big ole $5 Thai beer. The sampler had the corn fritters, veggie egg rolls and tofu in peanut sauce. The corn fritters were other worldly, totally killer, I really enjoyed the tofu and the veggie rolls. What a great way to open up the meal.

For our meals, we split the Seafood Panang which was shrimp, scallops, mussels, calamari and salmon in a spicy red coconut sauce. The ONLY part I didn't totally love was the calamari, it was waaaay chewy. Every other part was perfect. The shrimp were sweet and succulent, the scallops cooked to utter perfection, the mussels were done the was they're supposed to be not chewy, tender) and the salmon was something to slap my mama over. 

The other dish we had to split was the Merry Mu (grilled pork served with coconut rice and carrot \"relish\"). The pork was perfectly seasoned sliced large pork pieces, the coconut rice was a sticky ball of semi sweet rice (not my bag, but I think some people would like it) and the carrot relish was more like a sweet carrot salad. It did come with this really peculiar (in a good way) green salty/bitter sauce that I kept going back to. I realized a piece of the pork, with some of the sweet carrot salad and the sauce had the total package. Wow. 

We ended the meal with a stiff cocktail (I had this cosmo thing with sake, cranberry and lime juice that I had them serve me in a regular cup instead of the martini glass so I didn't look like a nancy) and wifey had a big ole slice of chocolate cake. Triple decker and all.

We ended up leaving around 720 or so, and the music was SUPPOSED to start at 7 but we didn't get to see it. Nevertheless, it was an awesome meal and I'm super stoked to have that cool Thai spot within walking/stumbling distance to the casa."}
{"text":"This place seems like it is past it's prime.  Cool small building in midtown, pretty cool inside.  However, the servers are slow.  I had a take-out order and I was instructed to sit at the bar and wait.  They took a good 10 minutes before even coming over to see what my name was.  They were pretty much dead that Sunday evening.

I ordered a basil chicken noodle dish and the pad Thai chicken.  They were both just ok.  We asked for the pad Thai to be extra spicy and all they did was dump on dried chilies at the end.  A huge mound of them.

Since Thai Elephant is closed on Sundays downtown, I might end up going back if I don't want to make a drive further, but most likely, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Food is average and tasty enough but way not worth to wait for 30 mins for the two entrees at a 50% full restaurant. Not only waited for 15 mins for table while there were lots of empty tables in the restaurant, after ordering, waited for another 30 mins before the food come. Cannot imagine how long the wait will be if it is rush hours. Compared to California, the volume is much less. Price is about the same. So for a family of three, you do need to order three dishes. 

Thai tea is extremely sweet.

Services is so slow that we are afraid to order dessert as we don't wait for another half an hour for it."}
{"text":"Quality and attentiveness of service took a nose dive. I can no longer go here during my lunch break because they're not often able to get me in and out of there in less than 1 hour.. One visit I waited 20 minutes just to be greeted at my table, another time our food took an hour just to come out of the kitchen. Today was my third try to see if the amount of servers/wait time had improved.. it hadn't. I had to have a hostess take our order just to prevent being 30 minutes late back to work (again)"}
{"text":"My husband and I moved away years ago but when ever we are in town we eat here. Wild Thaiger has remained almost exactly the same ( please change your pad Thai back, it was way better when you got all 3 proteins instead of a choice). In SF this place would be 3 or 4 times the price and not have the patio seating. My favorite dish is the beef panang. The curry is thick and not at all watery like you get at other places. I also love the spice. Definitely get the jasmine iced tea to cool your pallet. Their lunch specials are also an amazing value. Always choose the soup. It's so good! I wish they would take down the Guy poster but I guess that's a big deal in AZ. In SF he's is Known as a racist homophobe."}
{"text":"We arrived at Wild Thaiger on a Friday night at 5:45. The restaurant was busy but there were 3 empty tables and one group of 3 before us that was waiting in the outside patio area. The hostess was nowhere to be seen. About 5 minutes later, she shows up and takes down our names and tells us it will be about 10 minutes for a table for two. We're fine with that so we agree to wait inside the restaurant as it was pretty cold outside. Ten minutes pass. The group of 3 before us is still waiting and the 3 empty tables are still empty. In the meantime, about 5 other groups of people have come in after us and put their names down for tables. The hostess disappears again at 6pm. I noticed this because I looked at my phone and the 10 minute wait was now 15 and the group before us still had not been seated. About 5 minutes later, the hostess comes back to seat the group of 3 and disappears again. Two couples come into the the restaurant and after waiting 5 minutes at the hostess station, one of the couples walks to the back, hoping to get someone's attention so they  can put their name down for a table. We watched them stand there for 5 minutes and then walk out of the restaurant. 6:15. No sign of the hostess. Other people have arrived and walked out as well. We see the hostess clear a table and then bring to go boxes to a table and walk right by us. She doesn't make eye contact, she doesn't apologize, she doesn't tell us it will be just a few minutes. In fact, she scurries away so quickly, she doesn't hear us when we say \"Excuse me, miss?\" to get her attention to find out how much longer it will be. Most of the people who were in the restaurant when we arrived are now finishing their meals. It's 6:25 and the hostess has been away from her station for 25 minutes. Our 10 minute wait was 40 standing up without so much as an apology or offer of water or a drink while we waited. We decided to leave and as we walked out, wished the 6 groups of people behind us \"good luck\". Maybe they'd get one of the still empty tables. 

The front of the house is EVERYTHING in the restaurant world. That girl probably just cost the restaurant thousands in future business. I've heard great things about the food but I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Lackluster in presentation and flavor. Restaurant could use a good scrub and the vibe, a pick me up. My glass was dingy and we had to wait a while even on an empty weeknight. Skip."}
{"text":"I went back to Wild Thaiger for lunch today. I ordered Chicken  Pad Thai. It was mediocre and the service was bad. Waitress never asked us how the food was or how we are doing. When I asked her for chopsticks, she just walked away. I had to flag her down for our check. We arrived at the restaurant at 11:15 so it wasn't really busy."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is garbage. I would recommend going during less busy times. Even then, wait time might still be a problem."}
{"text":"Its a pain to place order in this restaurant. First of all, their service is very slow, it takes forever for the server to notice u and take your order. When the server finally comes to your table, its a struggle to make them understand what you want to eat, the restaurant would benefit from hiring servers who can communicate in English. After a long day at work, you dont want to spend 20 mins to help the serer understand your order. Also, they offer little room to customize your order as compared to other Thai restaurants. You can't customize how spicy u want your curry or if you want less veggies and more sauce in your curry or of you dont want chicken on your noodle, no other Thai restaurant has this problem to my knowledge.... I have been sitting here for for 20 mins now and the server hasn't served us water yet. They would do well to make the customer feel a little more welcoming."}
{"text":"The food was good but for six people they have a 18% mandatory tip but it is really a 20% tip that is added. We had to tell them that you do not charge a tip on the sales tax but on the sub total of the bill. Never saw a 18% for six people in my entire life. A tip should not be mandatory! The service was fairly decent."}
{"text":"Been there. Done that. It was ok. Lunch specials for all: two chicken pad Thai and two vegetarian pad Thai. All said theirs was ok.  Good size portions. Reasonably priced. Busy. Clean. Service was not the bested others have said. Another DDD (Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives) restaurant. We are finding hit and misses, Guy."}
{"text":"Husband and I decided to try this place out based on the great Yelp reviews and it did not disappoint!  We ordered takeout, and weren't too adventures.  I ordered the Beef Panang and husband ordered a peanut chicken dish.  Both were delicious, the chicken was moist and flavorful, and the Panang had just the right amount of spice.  One of my main complaints with the local Thai eateries is that they generally do not provide much spicy kick, but Wild Thaiger knows how to pack the punch.  Definitely do not order the spicy dishes if you can't take the heat."}
{"text":"I really like the service and food.  The atmosphere is really nice as well.  My only issue was that there is a fish tank there and i saw the wait staff cleaning it and sticking their hands in it.  I hope they washed their hands up to their elbows after words!  Fish tanks are nasty!!"}
{"text":"Most of my reviews for Asian restaurants in Phoenix begin with something like, \"it's good...for the area,\" but this place is just plain good. I'm a pretty serious Thai food snob and--even when I lived in Chicago--I only frequented a handful of Thai places.
That being said, I'm definitely going to be a repeat customer at Wild Thaiger.

My husband and I gave it a try for Dining out for Life when our first choice had a long wait. I've never been so happy I couldn't get a table somewhere. 

We sat outside on their patio which I would recommend to anyone. It's open yet cozy and comfortably cool. 

For our appetizer, we had the seafood pancake. I've never had anything like it but the description sounded too good to pass up. It's a crispy pancake full of sprouts, scallions, shrimp, mussels and squid. It was delicious and really unique. 

For dinner, I ordered the Decha Boar. The description listed it as being perfect for the \"true Thai foodie.\" With a description like that, I had to order it. The dish was spicy and flavorful. I'd caution anyone not familiar with Thai food that it might be a bit too spicy for you even if you like spicy foods. Different chiles effect people differently. My husband ordered the Ginger Fish. The sauce on the fish was like liquid crack. I could've taken a bath in it. Long story short: it was SO good. 

I'll definitely be back to try some of their other menu items. They have a smaller menu compared to most Thai places and I believe this allows them to focus on perfecting a few dishes instead of doing lots of mediocre things with Thai flavors. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"The meals at this restaurant are not your regular Thai dishes. They are elevated with beautiful presentation and delicious flavors that tantalize your taste buds.
The shrimp was cooked to perfection with a spicy and tangy noodles. The hand wrapped shrimp rolls were the best I ever had and the peanut sauce was outstanding.
The entire staff at this restaurant were female....never seen that before.
I highly recommend this place for a romantic dinner or just a night out with friends. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love peanut sauce and have had it at other restaurants.  I ordered their Chicken with Peanut Sauce thinking it would be great. Ewww!  It had a apple sauce consistency and tasted like a mixture of a lightly sweetened sauce and something that made my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth.  It was probably the worst dish I have ever had....ever.   I couldn't even eat it.  My dining companions were equally dissatisfied with their meals.  Their dishes did not have good flavor (or any flavor at all).  The service was mediocre at best.  I will never return."}
{"text":"The significant other and I came here after craving Thai. I had the forbidden rice with mahi mahi - he had curry of some sort. Both were delicious, and the fish was perfectly cooked. I greatly enjoyed this place and will be back soon. Yum!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner after seeing it featured in Triple D. Nice service, tasty food. Liked the Dragon`s Eggs. Reasonable prices. I would visit more often if it was closer to where I live,"}
{"text":"Note: trendy Thai food

This is a sweet Lil gym downtown. Great staff. We were greeted immediately, sat immediately, and served cheerfully, (thank you Nathan!) Was offer my choice of Scotch, (who would of thought, right?) Ordered a Panang with Shrimp and was surprised how beautiful the presentation was! Curry was thicker than I expected, which was a really good thing. Music was modern pop which was pleasantly surprising. I was wonderfully impressed and would recommend anyone here for anything from a lunch to a first date, (as long as they like spicy food.)"}
{"text":"Giving this place a 4 star only because the service was bad. Upon arriving my friend and I stood at the door for a solid 5 minutes. 4 different servers walked by us and we weren't greeted or acknowledged by any of them. I then stopped one of them and asked how long the wait would be. She then asked us to follow her to a table outside. 

Our server was friendly but not as attentive as we'd hoped for. 
Food was GREAT!! For starters we had chicken spring rolls. Really fresh and flavorful. Probably the best Thai food I've had, honestly. 
I also ordered a Thai tea and the chicken pad Thai. I will definitely be back for the food but not for the service."}
{"text":"I can only say that it was amazing!  I am a fan, and the service was really great.  I recommend trying this place if you like authentic Thai food.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The food is good. Definitely above average. But the service is so bad that it hardly makes up for it. If I got my food within AN HOUR AND A HALF of sitting down I would be satisfied, but the wait was ridiculous."}
{"text":"The Thai food is awesome!  I highly recommend the Fresh Rolls! When they first hit your lips, its so good."}
{"text":"Their pad thai was great, service was quick.  Crowded dinner service didn't allow for a lot of wiggle room, as the seats are pretty close inside."}

Unsanitary Conditions
**************************
last time we ate at this \"establishment\" a cock roach crawled across the bar.  When we told the owner we were told that a shipment of produce was infected by roaches. No offer to refund the meal was offered. We delivered an email of disapproval to the owner upon which she responded with refunding the meal.

today when we returned for the first time since that unfortunate incident the owner informed us we were no longer welcome in her establishment. 

It seems a roach infestation had lowered her Maricopa Health department score - which somehow was our fault for indicating to her that there was a problem.

very disappointing.  This is a restaurant i've enjoyed for years and years but will never dine at again."}
{"text":"Some dishes here are excellent. Some are not. Pad See Ew is one of my regular favorites, and I've never had one I disliked until trying it at Wild Thaiger. It had all the wrong flavors, and just didn't deliver what every other Pad See Ew I've had delivered. I'm fine with variation, but this was just a bust. 

Some of the more unusual dishes, on the other hand, are very tasty. Holy Basil Chicken is delicious if you order it to eat at the restaurant. However, if you order it to go, it will be badly overcooked by the time you get it home. I wish they took that into account when preparing it. Most Asian takeout does not seem to have this problem. 

I have many friends who think this is the best Thai in Phoenix. I hope they are wrong. So far, I haven't found better though."}
{"text":"Exactly and friendly service. This was my first time trying thai food. I ordered the chicken pad Thai it was very very delicious. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Food was less than expected based on my friends rave reviews. Disappointed! Pad Thai and Basil Chicken both very dry."}
{"text":"Had the Dragon Eggz..... nice taste. Had them crispy. I would order again.  Had the chicken pad thai. Great flavor, but not my flavor profile. Also ordered satay that was very, very tasty."}
{"text":"I am hopping mad.  Ordered take out at 7:15 and was told to give them 35 minutes.  Showed up after 45 minutes and was told it would be ANOTHER 40 minutes because they had to take care of customers in the restaurant first.  WHAT?  You can't take care of takeout and dining customers?  WHAT?  You don't bother to call the customer to tell her you aren't going to get the food done?  This is outrageous.  They didn't even offer an apology or some sort of concession.  Acted like it was normal!!!  Wild Thaiger is off my list forever.  Customer service at it's WORST!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre. There are two better thai options in the downtown area... Thai Elephant and Thai E San. Wild Thaiger had mediocre curry ( i have tried to enjoy dinner there two times,  and horrible, slow service. 

Check out the places I mention above."}
{"text":"Not a fan- poor service, marginal food.  I left barely eating the dish.  Not worth taking anything home."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for great Thai food. They let us in right when they closed and didn't skimp on the service. The waitress was the most energetic we've had and made perfect recommendations. The ribs are a must try, perfect spices and fall of the bone meat . The 24k vegetarian curry has the best presentation I've seen at a Thai restaurant and is filed with tasteful spices. There coconut rice is also a must try. Would recommend"}
{"text":"Only get to dine at the Thaiger a few times a year and it is always a real treat. I have tried a lot of the menu items and even though they are all amazing in their own right, I always come back to the Seafood Panang and the Thai Ribs. They have a creative cocktail list and amazing made from scratch deserts. Best Thai food in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We definitely weren't the easiest group, and I really appreciated the great service that we had last night.  Our party arrived noisily- 3 adults and 4 rather rambunctious kids. We asked to sit on their lovely, heated patio, but quickly realized that the kids were not going to be agreeable for a nice meal... so we opted to place an order to go. My son and I shared the yellow chicken curry and pad Thai. Both were fresh and flavorful with just the right amount of heat. You know it is good when a seven-year old asks for a third helping! I only wish there had been more rice... I have leftover curry to eat and we finished the rice last night! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Ordered the yellow curry chicken and some spring rolls for lunch through Postmates. The curry was perfectly spicy, the rice sticky and cooked right. The potatoes in the curry were just slightly undercooked in the middle, but the other veggies and chicken were fantastic. Spring rolls were crispy because they poked holes in the styrofoam containers to keep them from getting too steamy, amazing! Will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Most delicious Thai I've ever had. Be prepared to wait but it's well worth the wait. 

Just like everybody else, I discovered this restaurant after watching diners drive-ins and dives on the food network so my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try. 

We waited about 30 minutes for a table. Contrary to other reviews the waitstaff was quite friendly and had no problems taking our order quickly. We ordered a bunch of different things to try it all out. 

I LOOOOVED the Tom Ka (best I've ever had and I am/was loyal to Thai Rama)!!! For appetizer we had the Dragon Eggs- we preferred them steamed but tried both. We also enjoyed the yellow curry, spicy and delicious, as well as the Pad Thai with shrimp. All were amazing. I had the Milk Boba to drink and that was coconutty, sweet, and yummy! 

A little more pricy than we usually pay for Thai but the flavor profiles were bomb. We will be back. Soon we hope."}
{"text":"It seems like every time we come here there's a line. They lie about the wait just to keep you there. And when you actually sit down they make you wait another hour for your appetizer. Their food is okay because it's not awesome and is certainly not worth an hour wait."}
{"text":"This place was my very first Thai experience 5 years ago and it was delicious! We had one of the curries and it was the perfect balance of flavors. This place is what turned me on to Thai food being my favorite food. The restaurant itself is nice and their Thai iced tea was yummy. I wish the hours were better though."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times and almost always get the Pad Thai and always leave stuffed and happy.  I like Thaiger because I feel very appropriate drinking wine with my Thai food because of the swanky interior of the place.  I especially love the open air patio where I took my mom to dinner when she came to visit.  Some say this place doesn't have the best Thai food in the Valley and with so many options I would not be surprised if there is a superior Thai place somewhere.  However, in terms of classy Thai in Phoenix, you can't beat Wild Thaiger.  Also, I love the pun in the name.  There, I said it."}
{"text":"Delicious food, and a beautiful presentation. I had something that was called ginger chicken I think. Sorry, I can't remember but it was amazing! And the brown rice with some of the best race I've ever had."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Arizona hands down! Every single thing is delicious! I had the beef panang, Dragon eggs, pad Thai, hot basil, and there sangrias are a great compliment! I can't wait till I can go there again!"}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place. Hot pots are to die for and Panang is so delicious. The people that work there are dedicated and the alcoholic verve rages are delicious."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place in Phoenix. The food is top notch, portions are large and the prices are AMAZING! You can have a full meal with leftovers for under $10 bucks. They let us sit outside with our pup and every time we eat here everyone at our table loves their dishes. What more can you ask for? I like taking a stroll into the dark inside and looking at the photos of the famous people that have been here in the past, Steven Seagal and Guy Fieri included. Thinking about this place makes me hungry...."}
{"text":"Dragon Eggs Crunchy and Temple of Fire could be my new favorite Thai dishes. I'm still blown away by the amazing spiciness of my Chicken and Rice Temple of fire. Most places always give you a tamer version of a Thai dish but this one was quite the lip buzzer.

I was sweating through every delicious bite. Thankfully I ordered a combination of Soy Milk and Coconut water with Tapioca balls to complement my meal and Oh Wow, it was much better than you would think.

The inside area was far to dim and cramped for my taste. The thing that bothered me too much was the hard clashing of utensils, chatter, and the kitchen that made it an acoustic nightmare. I recommend sound baffling. It was really painful for me, and I don't even have sensitive hearing. I sat outside and on a cool April evening it was perfect. Besides my cosmetic opinions the food here was stellar. Among the best Thai food experiences I have had and will be coming back. Preferably when the outside area is available."}
{"text":"The panang and chicken curry are delicious. The dragon eggs are original and I like their green tea. Unfortunately the service is really lacking. We were here on a non busy night and the table service was very slow. It was disappointing especially for a restaurant that made diners drive-ins and dives."}
{"text":"I met someone here for dinner one night... They have the best Pad See Ue (sp?) that I have ever tasted. They sprinkle fried garlic over it and I love the burst of garlic every time I bite into one. Service was decent and the wait staff was very attentive. We had papaya salad, beef salad, chicken and beef satay and green curry. Everything was delicious. I live in the very northern parts of Phoenix but do not mind the drive. It is worth it."}
{"text":"Recently went back with a party of 10 for a bday celebration.
It was my pick, and I did consider how a party of ten could be a disaster in a small-ish, \"we're just a hole-in-the-wall that happens to be really popular\" place like WT. And sure enough, we arrive and wait in the tiny entry way for at least 10 min before being approached by anyone. In that time, a friend who had arrived early and staked out at the bar informed me that as soon as she sat down, she was told that she couldn't order food because the kitchen was temporarily shut down because they were too busy. At the time we arrived it was maybe 30 percent full, and she assured me that that had happened 30-40 minutes ago, so they should be back on track by now. 
The host finally showed up and said she could seat us, but it would be a while before the server would take our order bc they were \"recovering.\" Well, that's better than 10 people blocking an entryway, so I'm not sure why she seemed hesitant to seat us, even if we had to wait for a server. She assured us that we could order drinks from our table until the kitchen was \"ready.\"
It was only downhill from there. Thankfully, we were a jovial bunch - under any other circumstances this experience would have been disastrous. 15 min to get drink orders, another 15 to get the drinks. Another 20 min later he took our food orders. 30 min later they started coming out, sort of. Seven entrees came out, staggered over a period of five minutes. But three entrees - all pad thai - didn't arrive until at least 10 min later, when everyone else was finished. I understand not everyone can get food at exactly the same time with a party of 10, but they didn't even come close, and at the time we made our food orders it was at least an hour if not more after their alleged huge rush that shut down the kitchen. 
I got the peanut chicken - grilled chicken with peanut sauce, rice and grilled veggies. The sauce was too citrus-y for a peanut sauce and too thick (funny that I complained in my first review that my curry was too thin). Chicken underneath was completely flavorless and was dry and veggies were scant. Good thing it was only $10. Didn't get details from anyone else except the BF, who got the Kao Pad Jay, and kept saying over \"I'm so glad I got this!\"
All these issues seemed to be circumstantial (except the chicken dish), but, then again, how long has WT been a restaurant? Come on, I'm sure they've dealt with many a Saturday night rush and someone (ahem, manager??) should have at least come out to explain/apologize for their issues. Don't think I'll go back to dine in - ever."}
{"text":"One word: phenomenal. 

Amazing presentation,  amazing execution, well portioned. Everything on your plate was seasoned and served a purpose to the experience of the dish

Truly a special place and worth the drive from anywhere."}
{"text":"Probably the best Thai food I have had in a while. The ambience was excellent for being in downtown Phoenix and the assortment of foods yummy!

Tried the corn fritters -- interesting dish with a sweet hint to it.  The spicy fried egg from the secret menu was capturing to admire -- but tasted okay -- too sweet for me.

As per recommendations from others I ordered the veg pad Thai and veg temple of fire fried rice.  Rice was delicious and pad Thai held up to its rating. All pad Thai lovers will appreciate its taste. I'm not a pad Thai person.

All in all good food and good experience!"}
{"text":"The food was good, I had the tropical fried rice, and my other half had the new candy shrimp that was good too. Glad we came in when when we did not even 10 Minutes later they were packed. They staff are friendly and the food arrived quickly. Both dishes were very flavorful and great portions.  Will be back soon. They are short on indoor seating, but do have a nice covered patio to make up the difference."}
{"text":"Although I am sure the food would have been delicious, we decided not to wait the half hour. This half hour wait did not make any sense given there were many open tables. We were only two people and when we walked in there were two two-tops available and when we left 20 minutes later, one two-top was still available. This is extremely inefficient and resulted in lost business."}
{"text":"I eat here often since it is close by to my office. It is decent Thai for the area. It is always busy and the waitresses there sometimes look reallyyyyy angry but they are realllly nice. Don't let them scare you away! Their pad thai is the best I've had in awhile. If you are living cautiously I'd get that first."}
{"text":"Rarrrrr!  That was my thought when I ate at Wild Thaiger. Yeah, okay, so that is a totally cheesy line, but I can't help it, their food is rarrr-licious. 

My first visit was a few weeks ago and was for take out.  My friend and I looked over their menu, and although I'm not a huge connoisseur of Thai food, the menu was chock full of yumminess. I decided on the Chicken Curry lunch special. It wasn't too spicy, just the right amount of kick for me.  And, it was very flavorful and extremely filling.  I desperately wanted to finished it all, but my tummy was at full capacity from the rich curry sauce.

I can't wait to go back to Wild Thaiger and try more from their menu. Their prices are decent, and they've got a lot of great menu items to choose from. It seems like it would be a great place for dinner and, when the weather is nice, to sit outside on the front patio. I definitely can't wait to have more Rarrrr moments at Wild Thaiger!"}
{"text":"We were super excited to try this place because I had heard so many good things. We arrived at noon however, and they were already out of the Dragon Eggz, the main thing that we were coming to try. My boyfriend ordered Pad Thai, definitely the best that we have found in Phoenix. I got boar and found the lime to be so overwhelming that I couldn't eat it. I wrote that off to cultural tastes but I definitely won't be ordering that again."}
{"text":"Had been looking forward to going to this restaurant....we were not disappointed!!! The ribs are the best, curry was delish, pad Thai was wonderful, and we could've eaten soooo much more of their satay appetizer (peanut sauce is one of the tastiest we've had)!! Can't wait to go back to Arizona at Christmastime and take our friends!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time after a friend invited me and recommended this place. For the price you pay, this is pretty good Thai food. I had the Curry Chicken with a spring Roll and since I did not know the place I figured I can't go wrong with a pretty standard dish. It did not disappoint, it was spicy but not too much to burn my tongue and the dish size was just right for a full Lunch. I rounded it up with a sweet Thai Iced tea which is my favorite. The waitress was very nice, fast and courteous. I definitely can recommend this place and I am sure that I will be back at some point."}
{"text":"What is up with crappy customer service in this town?!?  I am giving this place 1 star based on the fact that my dinner companion and I couldn't eat more than 1 bite of the Mahi curry dish because it was so hot.  Don't get me wrong, I love spice, we have a multitude of hot sauces, chili paste and spicy oils in our home collection.  My companion loves, loves, loves things spicy, but when we both take a bite and can't actually taste any flavors of the dish, just burning lava, well it is simply to hot.  When we called our server over to let him know that the dish was way to hot to be palatable he asked if we wanted it boxed up.  Um no, please just take it away.  He didn't even ask if we wanted something different.
Here is the kicker, when he brought our check the dish was still on it.  I called him over and asked for him to remove it for the obvious reason that we sent it back.  His response, \"Ohhh sorry!  It does say spicy on the menu.\"  I couldn't believe it.  I got charged $14.95 for a dish we couldn't even eat.  Totally lame.  A manager didn't even come over to try to smooth this issue out.  I left nothing for the tip considering they were ok to rip me off.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Now, I'm not an expert on thai cuisine. I'm not an expert on anything really.  But I know what I like.  In this instance, I like this place.

Wild Thaiger is located a few blocks north of the Heard Museum.  As such, it's wonderfully convenient to go here for a bite then wander down to see some American Indian history and artwork.  This was exactly what brought me there last night.

I was seated immediately upon arrival.  The server cheerily came over and, when my first beer selection was out, suggested a few options that I might also enjoy.  I like getting suggestions on food and drink from people who obviously have some knowledge and care about the subject.  I was not disappointed.  The Thai beer I had was wonderful.  Unsurprisingly, much better than the standard American swill.

Being that this was my first time here, I had to order something from the house specials section.  I decided on the Jungle Love (insert 70s funk music here).  A dish of primarily \"exotic\" vegetables and thin sliced wild boar in a very spicy red broth.  It was superb.  The boar, which I'd never had before, was not the core of the dish but still quite flavorful.  It added a great contrast to the mass of vegetables in the pot.  I'll be honest, I'm not sure half of what I ate in there, but it was all good.  Good, and spicy.  Not the immediate burn you get from some hot food, but the seething heat that only makes you sweat and your lips burn when you're more than half done.  It was exquisite."}
{"text":"Writing this review after my second experience. The first time I had Wild Thaiger I went and ate there with a friend, the Dragon Balls are absolutely delicious, pad see ew was good but the extra charge for 3 medium shrimp was a little lame. Service was LESS THAN which was a bummer because the Owner/Chef was making rounds, with what seemed like regulars and she seemed super friendly and awesome. However, all the other servers looked like they truly hated their jobs, bummer. 

I'm writing this as I am eating Dragon Balls from my couch at home. I had Wild Thaiger delivered via Postmates just now and I'm pretty bummed out. The Dragon Balls are great, can't say nothing bad about those! However, my pad see ew has absolutely no flavor, very, scary, bland. I have fish sauce here at home so I've covered it enough to have some flavor so far. I also did not have an option to choose the shrimp as my \"meat\" but I noted I would prefer it but thought it was weird that I could not get it togo? I received pork and it is bland and dry, not the least bit salted. Also, don't order the Beef Broccoli thinking it's the Chinese style Beef Broccoli, I didn't take the star off for the Beef Broccoli because, I'm aware this is a Thai restaurant, I'm Thai myself, but most Thai restaurants I have gone to serves beef broccoli chinese style, it's also very bland as well. 

I'm really bummed out as I hesitated on which Thai place to order from near me and the first time it was good but this time around it's like a complete 180, the food really hurt my feelings lol, but seriously. I'm not one to complain but I'm contemplating calling to let the restaurant know because I don't feel like the $40 was worth anything I got. Really hope I can have this resolved in some way because I'm soo willing to try Wild Thaiger again to try different things and forever get Dragon Balls. I don't know tho =(((((((((((((((((("}
{"text":"Always a great place for Thai food. Had my go to Chicken pad Thai. Usually I like to save some for lunch the next day but it was just so good, I had to finish it. My girlfriend had the shrimp pad Thai and they are always very generous with shrimp. Unlike some place where you get like 3 pieces. A comeback place for sure."}
{"text":"Good Pad Thai. Cold Singha beer. I order the same stuff every Thai restaurant. Coconut Ice Cream is good...ate at the bar....they let me have the remote to the TV too....perfect."}
{"text":"Diners, drive ins and dives listed this place as a MUST try do we did. k so first off let me explain why they didn't receive a 5 star. We came at 8pm on a Fri night and it wasn't too busy for a mom n pop spot. The lighting was HORRIBLE. I understand u want to set the mood outside but if customers tell you more than once that they can't read the menus then something needs to change. They lite a candle but it gave little to no help. We had to use our phones. Another thing we noticed is that the food took SSSOOOO long to come out! Also, by the time the food came out (3 plates at first and then another 10 minutes later) the food was luke warm. It seemed like they had plates ready but waited for the others to come out which made the rest of the food barely warm. 

Ok on the upside, the presentation of the food was great! We ordered beef pad Thai, tropical chicken fried rice, yellow chicken curry and peanut chicken plate. They were all very good, but the temperature of the food down played it. It all tastes great. We were so Hungry after our softball tourney that we didn't want to send it back since it took so long in the first place. 

Overall it's pretty good Thai food. Service was good as well. We Had a hard time understanding our waitress but we made it thru. If you're a local come try it."}
{"text":"Soups are wowzy spicy and the presentation is cool.  Pad Thai is as good as it gets.  Also the the Dragon appetizer."}
{"text":"Best panang curry and spicy noodles! The service was great; we came 30 minutes before closing time and they were very accommodating."}
{"text":"Got an order to go and it wasn't bad but it was just a basic meal.  Got the Freshie Roll and Green Curry with extra vegetables.  The green curry did have a good spice to it, but that was pretty much the only thing that stood out for the dish.  The Freshie Roll was very good and the peanut sauce was great!  

I had seen all the reviews about service being slow, which is why I opted to order to go.  The order was placed and filled and I was back in the car within less than 15 minutes."}
{"text":"totally yummy food!  I love their appitizer veggie sampler, and their desserts are good too.  I recommend the thai custard."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant.  It was a 30 minute drive from Laveen, as all are the Thai places in the area.  I ordered two of my staples (Tom ka Gai soup and Green Curry) and tried a new dish (for me), Holy Basil.  I got everything takeout.

I'll start with the Holy Basil.  It was very good.  A nice balance of Thai flavors, and I thought it was quite similar to an Ayam Basil dish I used to get at a Malaysian place in Mt. View, CA.  My only complaint was that the chicken was big, thick chunks, like a fajita-style.  I expect delicate, tender meats at a high end Thai place.

I opened my green curry and said: \"WHERE'S THE SAUCE\"?  I am VERY upset at the lack of sauce.  There was so little I can't comment on the flavor of the curry.  And, they had 2 different types of green beans in there:  chinese long beans, and American green beans.  The larger Amercian green beans weren't cooked.  That sucked.  The beef was tender enough but the peices were too big.  The one redeeming part of this dish was the fact that they had eggplant in it.  There is something about eggplant in green curry....

The Tom Ka Gai soup was  fantastic.  My only complaint would be the chicken, which again, was large fajita-style slices.   Doesn't make sense to me.

While I was waiting at the bar for my order, I remember looking into the kitchen and wondering how they could possibly prepare everything on the menu in that tiny space.  Now, I think I know:  I suspect they prep all of their meats ahead of time and use the same size/shape/cuts for each dish to save time.  This results in a fajita-style cut of chicken that leaves me less than thrilled.

Overall, the menu is brief and the food is good, but I don't think it's worth a long drive.  I don't expect to return when I could make the same drive to get to Swadee, which was just fabulous.  I gave this place a 3/5 because the Tom Ka Gai soup and Holy Basil were VERY good.  I am however disappointed in the green curry, the  cuts of meat, and by the way they completely ignored my request for Thai spicy; everything was rather mild in my opinion."}
{"text":"First visit early dinner. Chicken spring rolls, super soup with shrimp and chicken, pad thai chicken, coconut ice cream, malbec wine. Everything delicious and fresh.  We stuck to basic dishes for our first visit.  I will definitely adventure next visit.  The soup had lots of vegetables cabbage,  carrots,  zucchini,  cauliflower,  peas.  The pad thai noodles were tasty  with raw cabbage,  carrots,  green onion,  bean sprouts,  and peanuts on the side."}
{"text":"This was my first and last experience at Wild Thaiger and I will not be going back. Ever. The service was unacceptable. From the moment my friend and I entered the restaurant the experience was bad. In hindsight, I should have walked out after our issues with the hostess. She repeatedly asked us where we would like to sit, or how many people were in our party, and then she would walk away while we answered or disregard that we had answered her at all. It was like she was incapable of absorbing information. We finally got seated. The table behind us very loudly cancelled their order paid for their drinks and left stating that the service taking too long. The writing was on the wall. At first, I felt like those people were incredibly rude, but now I wish that I had left too rather than enduring a total lack of service. 
It took a long time for us to get water or our drinks. We ordered an appetizer at the same time as our drinks, the appetizer took 45 minutes to arrive, the waiter forgot that we had ordered anything at all, came back to the table to confirm the appetizer TWICE and still brought us the wrong item and then had the nerve to charge us for it! I asked for menu suggestions, the waiter just stared at me blankly. I asked if I could have steamed rice rather than fried, he said that was impossible to change. Impossible. Eventually our entrees came, I ordered soup, it wasn't good. He brought out a teacup for me to use as my soup bowl. It was almost impossible to manage. Then our check came, he overcharged us. I didn't dispute anything because I just wanted to leave. I paid in cash, he shorted me five dollars. I called that his tip, and left. 
The restaurant was not busy, it was typical for a Wednesday night. There is no excuse for their wait times or rudeness. I found the menu to be limiting, and the items lacked enough description. I will never go back. I have no idea how it had such good reviews."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of spicy food and this stuff knocked my socks off. If you aren't as adventurous with your spices (or just don't want your tongue to die) simply ask them to make it mild. 

All in all super yummy, will def be back. Oh and you have to try the thai iced tea. Its mental how good it is.

I gave it 3 stars because I don't want to throw around stars and save them for those rare AWESOME moments when food knocks my socks off :D

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"One my favorite Thai restaurants. The Peanut Passion chicken, the Pad Thai, Kimow, Pad Cha Seafood, and everything else I've ever eaten here has been nothing short of delicious. Generous portion sizes, reasonable prices, and a warm and pleasant atmosphere. Highly recommended.

The fried coconut banana with coconut ice cream is an amazing dessert!"}
{"text":"For serious my absolute favorite place for Pad Thai.. just when I thought it couldn't get any better.. holy hell. I had to ask the name of the cook.. I believe she said Minor. Holy.. the peanut sauce was beyond amazing. The peanut is distinct and vibrant, with just the right hint of chili powder to enhance the already harmonious flavours.. out of this world."}
{"text":"Great place and fantastic location for a quick business lunch in the trendy downtown core.  Prices are reasonable, service is friendly, portion size is generous, and the place is decorated tastefully inside with dark wood tones; the patio area is lovely with lots of seating and misters to help hydrate diners in the summer heat.  I have only visited a couple of times for lunch, so cannot comment on dinner service, but both of my lunch visits were delightful.  I had the tofu veggie panang on visit #1 and the tofu veggie yellow curry on visit #2 (I am trying to eat less meat for those who are wondering why I did not partake in the carnivorous options).  Loved both the red chili sauce (panang) and the yellow curry sauce; both were spicy enough with great flavour and came with your choice of soup or spring roll (I opted for the spring roll both times -- YUM!).  Lunch prices range from $8-10.  Go and visit the Thaiger!"}
{"text":"The service is on great. The food is just okay. Nothing the blew me away and the prices are above average. I would stick to mom and pop shop for thai food when i am in the area. It was crowded but a lot of the hype comes from iGuy Fieri."}
{"text":"\"Totally a fan\"

We happened upon this place in search of a new place to have dinner as a team. Between the corn fritters, pad thai, spring rolls with chicken, and a few other tasty items, there is something for everyone! I love watching the chef(s) in this small open kitchen. He literally takes out every bad noodle to ensure perfection for each plate. What does this translate to -- really slow service on your entrees but goodness when received.

We've been back at least 3 times in 3 weeks. That says a lot. Just be patient with your food and overall service (-1 star)."}
{"text":"To start,  there were 6 open tables inside where we wanted to be seated.  After 6 apologies and 20 minutes later we were seated.  That was the only bad part of our experience.  The food,  we ordered the crispy Dragon Eggs.  Oh they were so good. I ordered the pork skewers and my wife ordered the chicken Sei Ew with vegetables.  Again, they were awesome. The waiter,  excellent!  Very attentive and enjoyable. We sat at the high table where there is a painted face of a tiger that was made to look like Guy. Next to it was 'Guy Ate Here'.  Next to that was his signature and date, 12/14.
Awesome restaurant!  You have to go there!"}
{"text":"Finally got to eat at this place after driving by so many times.  It was great - great food, great set up, great vibe, great servers, everything was just great.  Went for lunch and got 2 great meals off the lunch menu and our total bill was $20...can't beat that.  The iced tea was a little different but in a good way - I think it was a green tea iced tea.  Very impressed, will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I haven't been in a while but I remember being impressed.  Nice ambiance, especially for a Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Food has gotten better over the last few months but their service sucks. They don't answer their phone during lunch. I called about 25 times in the last half an hour. The message states only to call back.

If you make changes to this issue, I'll change my rating because your food is better than one star and I'd like to give you more but I can only be so patient for lunch when I have half an hour to spend ordering, waiting, retrieving, and eating."}
{"text":"Good food. Friendly service. Love the dim lighting and aquarium.  I've gone there as a group and even with one other person"}
{"text":"Thai Iced Tea, Pad-Thai & Chicken Satay.  A trifecta of flavor goodness.  A great place to go for lunch because its right in the heart of downtown Phoenix.  Yay!"}
{"text":"I recently frequented Wild Thaiger on a whim... based mostly on other Yelp reviews and convenience of location. I was VERY pleasantly surprised. 
Although the exterior of the building isn't very nice, the patio seating was perfect for this spring day with protection from the sun, a casual ambiance and attentive wait staff. 
The menu is pretty typical, although they indicate Gluten Free items, which is very rare for Thai restaurants! This is super cool and much appreciated as it's more difficult for me to intuit ingredients in \"ethnic\" cooking. 
The vegetarian Tom Ka was brilliant and our curry dish was one of my husband's favorites ever. We didn't try any other menu items. 
I didn't experience the scene inside- we were dining on a weekday for lunch, so I can't speak to that. 
All in all, a great experience."}
{"text":"Lunch here today.  Pad Thai taste better than any I EVER had before though portion was small.  The ribs where out of sight....wow.....get the ribs and two people only need a half rack."}
{"text":"Some friends of mine took me to the Wild Thaiger for my birthday.  I can't think of a better place to have my birthday dinner. This place is fantastic!  The food was great and served with true elegance but in a casual setting. Even though it was a weekend evening and the place was absolutely packed, the service was great.  We were told right from the start that there would be at least a 20 minute wait and they were dead on in their estimate.  No problem at all.  I don't mind waiting if I'm told the wait time and it is accurate. 

The atmosphere is relaxing, intimate and the decor is not over done as are so many Thai restaurants.  Can you say clean?  Even on such a busy night they kept the place almost spotless, even the bathrooms.  The kitchen is open to the dinning area and you can see how well managed and organized every thing is.  The kitchen staff looked like a well oiled machine in action.

The Food and Drinks:
Well to start off, we didn't order any adult beverages this evening as we were going out to a local night club after dinner for our fill of libations. Instead I ordered the Iced green tea which was brewed to perfection!  I don't remember what everyone else had but I know one member of our party got the Thai Iced tea and said it was fantastic.

Appetizers:
We ordered a bunch of appetizers for the table.

Dragon Eggs - These pork and crab stuffed dumplings were tender, tasty and served with a mild-tangy dipping sauce.

Satay Sampler - Shrimp, beef and chicken skewers marinated in a tasty coconut curry and served with peanut sauce and cucumber chutney. Loved it!

Wild wrap - Spicy chopped chicken with a mint-lime sauce served with cabbage leaves. This tasted so fresh. Yes, spicy but very refreshing at the same time.

Veggie Spring Rolls - Tender and crispy rolls stuffed with fresh veggies, cellophane noodles and served with a great plum sauce. They really were tender yet crisp, hot, tasty and the veggies tasted so fresh you would think they had a garden out back. I looked for it but found nothing but parking lot.

Hot Pot:
We also shared a Tom Yum Goong hot pot. The soup was nice and spicy, the shrimp was tender, the mushrooms had a rich earthy flavor and the lemongrass infused a wonderful aromatic hue to the soup.

Main Course:
I had the Ginger Fish. This is a breaded piece of salmon topped with mushrooms, onions, carrots and pineapple with a ginger sauce along with fresh sauteed veggies and rice. The presentation was first-class and portion size was very generous . In fact, I ended up taking about half of it home.  Trust me, it was so delicious that I really wanted to finish the whole dish but after all the appetizers and soup I thought I might explode if I didn't stop eating!

Once again, I cant remember what everyone else had but there were no complaints at all.

Desert:
OMG the Lemon Ginger Cheesecake is to die for!  Enough said. Period!

Will I go back?
I wish I lived in their back room so I could eat every meal there.

Hats off to The Wild Thaiger.
The best Thai food I have found anywhere in Arizona."}
{"text":"Food is great. I've been a loyal customer for about 15 years. But service has just been terrible.  Server seemed to be unpleasant and in a rush. Definitely won't be coming back anytime."}
{"text":"Pad Thai & Springs rolls are pretty tasty! I can't say I was blown away, but it was definitely good. I order one single Spring Roll, and I guess they accidentally made it a full order (4 Spring Rolls)... Well they went ahead and just gave them to me for the price of one. Pretty sweet! It's the little things..."}
{"text":"The first day of fall and dinner outside on the patio in downtown Phoenix sounds perfect for Friday evening. I saw this place on Diner, Drive-in, and Dive show on the food network, and could not wait to try it. I knew I had to get the Dragon Eggs, which did not disappoint at all! I got them half steam/fried! Yum! My guest and I decided to enjoy Ribs... oh boy! Ribs were tender and falling off the bones and so sweet with touch of spice. We finished off dinner with mango sticky rice...Everything was mouth watering and delicious."}
{"text":"Being a bit of a Thai fan, I had driven by Wild Thaiger a number of times only to find it next to impossible to get reliable access due to all the light rail construction (I suspect my frustration and quitter mentality was pretty commonplace during the construction).  Now that the rail is almost up and running and getting to Wild Thaiger isn't such a chore, I went with a group of 6 to try this place out.

When you walk in you immediately notice how dark it is as the lighting given off by candles and the kitchen in the back.  I've been to plenty of restaurants that do this to set the mood of the place so I don't mind candlelight.  However, this place was almost pitch black at times to where I couldn't see my dish so they could improve on the lighting a little bit.  The booths are small and set up very nice if you're just out on a date with your special someone.

The menu selection isn't vast but has all the usual suspects (curries, noodles, tofu dishes, etc.).  I had the chicken and potato dish with yellow curry with some cucumber and pepper veggies on the side.  While the presentation was very nice, the dish itself was just okay.  Almost everyone in the group I was with also had a currie dish and agreed the presentation was more impressive than the taste itself.  The one gal who got a noodle dish however said hers was terrific.

Most of us got dessert to finish things off.  I got a slice of the mango cheesecake (very tasty).  Another person got the lemon ginger cheesecake and was very happy.  Everyone else got slices of the chocolate cake (which were HUGE by the way).

They also have drink specials on Monday and Wednesdays.  We went on Wednesday for $4 wine glass night.  I was gung ho to try a sip of the red Thai wine, but strangely the waiter strongly recommended against it.  I has a Shiraz instead which was fine.  Most everyone else got a white wine.

Overall, the service was a little bit slow (especially getting us our check), but it was adequate.  The waiter was knowledgable about the nuances of each dish (which was good because two people in our group never had Thai food before).  Amazingly, when we originally sat down, the restaurant was just about dead.  But after 8:30pm the place was packed!  Not sure if this is normal, but seems like alot of the folks who live in and around the downtown area needed a late Thai fix.

Bottomline, good, but I've had better.  I commend Wild Thaiger and their people for surviving the onslaught of light rail construction that no doubt crippled their business.  Based on what we've seen, this place had a pretty solid local following so clearly they've done something right.  This place is okay if you're looking to go out with a group, but I'd probably enjoy this place more if it was just me and my girlfriend."}
{"text":"This place can never go wrong with food and hospitality . Great staff and good energy !!"}
{"text":"Visited during a weekday lunchtime.  I was enticed by their description on google, \"sleek and contemporary\".  Was very disappointed upon entering. They would need a major renovation before calling themselves sleek and contemporary!!  I ordered the Pad Thai which was only mediocre at best.  I don't believe they made the chicken to order as it was very chewy and tough, like it was reheated in the microwave. The service was pretty good, not a long wait for seating or service.  I was so excited to find a new Thai restaurant that I could take my hubby to but I will have to say I will not be returning."}
{"text":"A friend saw this restaurant on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives and told me to try it out.
We went tonight as it is 3 blocks for our condo.
530 dinner and the restaurant was empty. Cute patio but too hot and they weren't seating outdoors. Plenty of parking in the back. Interior is a little dark but nicely done with a small made up bar if you need to come alone.

Guy Fieri recommends the Dragon Eggz : (dumplings) and we got one order split half fried and half steamed. The sauce is phenomenal. Loved the skillet plating and extra jalapeños.
I am a sucker for Papaya Salad if done properly: The flavor was on point and they didn't put ground peanuts on theirs which is a plus for me. Definitely forgot to ask for Thai hot as there was no heat at all. Maybe they underestimated me cause my hubby is white.
Beef panang curry: very tender beef like other reviews state. Flavor of the curry was very different than the norm. Much lighter in texture too and didn't have vegetables. 
Pad Thai with chicken: hubby said it was decent but nothing to write home about.
I very much dislike coconut but how could I not try the famous coconut ice cream? We ordered the fried banana with coconut ice cream and they battered the banana in shaved coconut too. More for hubby! The ice cream flavor and texture was good.
Server was excellent and I loved her accent. 
The entire restaurant was full by the time we left and people were waiting outside.
Will be back to try the hot pot.
Good, but not anywhere near the top for Thai food."}
{"text":"First time at Wild Thaiger. Had lunch on a Saturday early afternoon with my wife and daughter. 
It was 95 degrees but the patio was pleasant. We ordered Thai iced teas, which took a while to arrive. I don't think our waiter thought the patio was pleasant. 

My wife ordered the GF Pad Thai, our daughter ordered the Tofu Curry and I got Dragon Eggs and Phuket Fantasea. Lunch arrived after 25 minutes, a bit long for lunch. 

The Pad Thai was good. All the elements were served apart from each other, so you could mix ingredients as you wish - nice touch. The Curry and Fantasea were both good as well. 

The prices were fairly steep though. My Dragon Eggs (dumplings) were $9 and the Phuket Fantasea was $18. All-in-all, the bill was $60+ plus tip. That's a pricey lunch, even for Thai food. 

I may try it again, going with less expensive dishes and hope for better service."}
{"text":"I've stopped here a few times over the years for lunch and it has always been good. The ginger chicken is delicious, as is the pad Thai. The spring rolls are just ok but maybe I got an \"off\"'batch since everyone else seems to think they are great. The service is decent and you can generally get in and out in an hour so it's a good lunch option if you work in the area.
The lunch menu prices are fair at about $8 an entree."}
{"text":"It's easy to forget how a great hostess sets the tone for a meal...sadly, it seems this hostess did too as she tried to meet her needs, not the customers...too late now...taking the food to go... After multiple requests for a darker area were pretty much unaccommodated... Hopefully the food is worth the hassle."}
{"text":"The food is really good but the chef tops it with a good presentation witch makes your meal that more delightful. Thank you wild thaiger team, you are always so friendly and  truly take care of your regulars."}
{"text":"After an intense therapy session, I came to Wild Thaiger to debrief. 

They have lunch specials and bottomless french-pressed tea. The organic green tea is my favorite. Everything was very delicious and refreshing. The patio is the style of restaurants on Washington Ave, Miami Beach.

My 'Thai Spicy' green curry beef came out artistically and I took a picture. I saw other people taking pics of their food, as well. Who doesn't want to eat beauty?

The soup was fantastic. I doctored it up with mad jalapenos and dry red chili paste. My nose was snotting down my face.. 

Cultural note to the haters:
Thai people eat cockroaches as an after bar street fare. Jebus ppl! 
It's better than a bacon wrapped hot dog out the side of a utility van."}
{"text":"Busy lunch spot. The place had a heavy bar scent. 
Green papaya salad did not have the refreshing sour crispness that I love and crave. It was over the top in spiciness though. It had small chunks of pickled chili peppers through out. Heavy handed with dressing that was missing peanuts  and not enough lime. 
There was an up charge of 3 dollars to swap out regular soy sauce for tamari. 
 The restrooms were clean. 
Would not return."}
{"text":"...we stopped in for lunch on a Friday at 11:30 AM while visiting from Tucson to see a Lana Del Rey/Courtney Love concert.  The front desk clerk at the hotel we were staying at recommended this place highly.  She was from Seattle and said she understood good Thai food. We trusted her and showed up promptly at 11:30.  By noon there was a line out the door and around the corner.  The staff was friendly and efficient and the owner/manager was directing the action which gave the whole experience a sense of organizational calm.  Anticipation was high and we were not disappointed.  The food was awesome!  The spring rolls were light, fresh, crisp and the wrap was flaky delicate pastry like.  The curry chicken was spiced just right and delicious. The Thai egg flower soup was perfect and had a definite kick to it.  The coconut ice cream was delicious fresh and homemade.  Absolutely the best Thai food I have had since moving from Portland, Oregon to Tucson in 2007.  I will definitely be hitting this place up again next time I am in Phoenix.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Not what I was expecting for Thai food. It was mediocre. The service just made the food taste bad. My friend and I arrived, had to wait for the server to seat is the waiter some more for her to take our order. Food did come out quickly but we never saw he after that. She never checked up on us to see how the food was. We had to flag her down to ask for a high chair for my friends baby and find her to get our check. Not the hype I was looking forward to."}
{"text":"Food was decent but very Americanized.  Neat place to hang out, but not the best for legit Thai food."}
{"text":"There may be equals but not better restaurants than the Wild Thaiger. (Have no idea what a Thaiger is...is there a tame one?)  Anyway, went there today for lunch for thefirst time and was super impressed.  Service by a drop dead georgeous Thai waitress was excellent.  Food was superb...don't see how it could have been better.  Wife had chicke curry which was excellent.  I had pad tai which could not have been better.  Food came immediately.  Steaming hot.  Lovely!!
Hardest part of visit was finding the parking lot.  Once you know where it is, you'll always know.  I parked on right side of the building.  Fortunately there's a sign saying it's on othe other side.  From then on.....a piece of cake.
I'm no stranger to Thai food and Wild Thaiger is one of the best."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmmmm!  I came here with a group for a birthday celebration, and the weather was just perfect for patio seating.  We started off with some Thai beers, trying out a couple of recommendations, and a variety of starters.  That was the easy part, picking something to eat was a terribly hard decision, everything looked amazing.  

Lucky for us, with 5 people, everyone picked something different.  I had the best Beef Panang EVAR!  The mix of curry and coconut was perfect....all the flavor, and the heat came, but after you tasted it on every inch of your tongue.  The jasmine rice was the perfect base for the sauce, and the beef was perfectly cooked.

I love curry and spice, but I want to taste the food too, and they gave me all of the heat and all of the flavor.  For my mom, who can't eat spicy stuff, they had enough options, and she was thrilled to get something that tasted great.

Most of the people we were with have been to Thailand, and they all agreed that this was very authentic.

They even brought out a nice traditional, homemade ice cream dessert for the birthday boy - which we all shared.

Everything I tried, I liked and I really need to go back and try more of their menu...I think I could go frequently and not get bored!  I just wish it could hit them up on my lunch.

They are also right off the light rail line, which makes it much easier for a Chandler girl to get to - no worries about traffic or parking."}
{"text":"First time visiting today. We went at lunchtime and ordered pad Thai and beef broccoli.  It was busy and the food took awhile to arrive.  Both the food and service was ok.  I've had much better beef and broccoli - meet was overcooked and flavorless.  There are so many good reviews and it's a DDD stop so we may give it one more try...."}
{"text":"Super Soup, best winter takeout, enough for 2 meals, love it! I always feel better after Super Soup"}
{"text":"This place is all about the food. Atmosphere is \"eh...\" service is ok...but the despite the wait - the food is exceptional! 100% worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Disappointing to say the least!  We came in years ago when it first opened and now I remember why we haven't been back...the food is just not good.  We both ordered the pad see ew - little to no flavor and the pork was tough.  Sorry, but we won't make the same mistake again for a third time!"}
{"text":"Great place to visit. Food is always fresh and great tasting.  When the first opened, they had a Peanut Salmon dish that was amazing.  Though they don't have it any longer, others great.  Pad Thai, Peanut Chicken (good substitute), beef and broccoli, so many to discuss."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of Thai food, mainly because I have not been exposed to enough of it...but I CRAVE the Beef Panang from Wild Thaiger!  I have had it twice along with the Pad Thai and Kimowi (sp?).  The iced green tea was refreshing and wished I had saved room for the lemon ginger cheesecake.  
I have tried dining in and take out both (dinner only), and the only reason I don't go 5 stars is the very slow (but friendly) service.  Plan to wait at least 5 minutes to be greeted by your server and once the food is finally served...your on your own."}
{"text":"The food was fine but the service was atrocious.  We went for an early dinner before a game and only a few tables were occupied.  Nonetheless, after asking for a few minutes to look over the menu, our waiter disappeared and never came back.  We flagged down another employee who got the waiter.  After we got the food, he checked on us once and disappeared.  We never saw him again.  A young woman brought the check after we flagged down yet another employee and asked.  Really, where were all the servers?  

It was also disappointing to me that the bill was not clear.  On one side was 4 * $6.50 for drinks but no drink total anywhere.  On the other side was our two entrees, each with a price, and then a grand total.  I like to check the bill so I calculated it and it was right, but why not list all the items ordered, then tax, then a total?  

We were late for our game."}
{"text":"I have been going crazy on trying all the well rated thai restaurants around the valley.  Thai food is my new favorite.

I was really excited to try this place with my husband on Saturday.  I really enjoyed the opportunity to eat outside on such a beautiful day.

I was grossed out a bit on how dirty it was (the grime on the plastic curtains around the porch), the dust on the fans, ect.  I do realize I was eating outside in the desert though so I tried to let it go.

The service was pretty bad.  We had to ask for ice tea refills.  We had to ask for additional sweetner packets.  We were told they didn't have rice to serve our meal with so we would get rice noodles.  This was told to us in a very straight forward mannner with no apologetic tone at all.  No rice at a thai restaurant?!?!  How do you run out of something so basic???

Anyway, the must have remedied the situation because we did indeed get rice with our meals.  My husband ordered the wild boar.  He thought it was just okay.  I had the eggplant and tofu.  I asked them to add some thai pumpkin to it.  It was SUPER YUMMY.  The bill was a bit expensive and I won't be running back.  

It took us over an hour to get our lunch!!  We didn't stay once we were done eating and spent almost 2 1/2 hours at the restaurant!!

Truth be told I think Thai Elephant or Papaya Thai are still my favorite thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Not the classiest place in Phoenix but, very good food and service. Their food is as close to real Thai that we have tasted anywhere in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious! I would highly recommend their thai green curry (has a nice spicy kick to it), and the pad thai is worth a try as well. Unfortunately, the service is incredibly, incredibly slow."}
{"text":"My favorite dishes include the green curry and fried catfish with red curry... Hands down the best in the city."}
{"text":"Over-priced, over-crowded designer Thai joint.

I've only been there once, and for lunch, but it was the kindof underwhelming experience that makes it not worth the trip back.

First off, if you come at lunch time, you have to deal with hoards of suits who come here for it's lush interior design to serve as the backdrop to their loud and uninteresting war stories. Next, you have to accept a very short and unimpressive lunch menu that has next to nothing that I usually get at a Thai restaurant. Finally, you have to sift through a very bland and unauthentic entree with excellent presentation.

I really should go back and try it again. But with the likes of Thai Hut now open, I don't know why I ever would unless I was forced through a work trip. Especially with how bland the food is for a Thai restaurant. I prefer Thai food that lights me up like a Christmas tree."}
{"text":"Really a 3.5 was the consensus between my husband and I...not really a 4 or a 3.  The cons- ambiance and size of curry entrees. The pro- flavor, I had the 24k and he had the beef.  Neither were very spicy (we love Thai hot) but the flavor very nice.
We agreed that in central phoenix we would suggest SaBai Modern in comparison."}
{"text":"My husband and I saw this place on DDD and thought we would give it a try. Service was great, food came out quickly. I would say the food is good, but not great. Chicken Pad Thai was bland and not spicy at all. Dragon eggs good, peanut Chicken good. My guess is this isn't the best Thai place in town."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night... its very good location with a nice patio. The food was fresh and was good. I only gave it 4 out of 5 just because I have tried Thai food twice now and really not impressed. Food not that favorable. I think I will be sticking with Chinese and Japanese."}
{"text":"Love this place for some decent Thai! Shrimp & Chicken Pad Thai is always good and never disappoints, the soups are great, I also really like their Beef Panang. Their desserts always sound good and they usually have something that involves mango, how I have escaped never trying one is beyond me. Their over all menu is a bit limited and is kept to the basics but what they do have is done well."}
{"text":"Pretty good food.  It is a small place so when you go do not go with the intention that it will be fast getting your food because it can be pretty slow at times."}
{"text":"it was the 3rd of July and all other Thai food restaurants were closed. we decided to try this place as it was nearby. I was in the mode for something new, I tried the De-cha boar.. it was delicious. if you're in the mood for something different and spicy I would defiantly recommend it.  the service was great."}
{"text":"Good food. Small inconvenient parking and entry.  Prices are higher than normal. Near $17 for Pat Se Eu with shrimp....for lunch??  Oh yes."}
{"text":"The food came out fast but COLD.   From the appetizer to main courses.   We ordered the half steam& half fried crab wontons,  papaya salad and skewed chicken but grilled sliced chicken was served w salad,  baby back ribs,  and yellow curry chicken.     We saw a chef in the kitchen but no sound of real cooking.   It appears that our orders were all precooked.   Very disappointed w the food!   We saw this restaurant featured on Guy last night  and thought we have found a new Thai spot.   We will never go back here to eat reheated food."}
{"text":"First time here and the service was terrible. We sat for over 10 minutes without anyone acknowledging us. We had to say something and the hostess took our order. The food was not good. There are better Thai restaurants in LA. Don't know why it was featured in DDD?? Will definitely not be coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The dragon eggs appetizer was great. We got the mix of steamed and crispy, but my buddy and I both agreed we preferred the crispy texture to the steamed. The sauce was tangy with some sweetness that was offset perfectly with the jalapeño slices.

As I do with a new Thai spot, I opted for the Pad Thai with chicken, my friend got the panang curry with a mix of beef and chicken. The Pad Thai was honestly one of the best I've ever had, and hands down the best in Phoenix. It was spicy, the noodles were sticky and delicious. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The presentation was impeccable,

The panang curry was not what either of us are used to as it was red opposed to the normal green, but it was super smooth, almost smoky and crazy flavorful. It wasn't clumpy and very creamy. The only downside was the $2 charge to sub brown rice for the traditional jasmine rice.

I would highly recommend Wild Thaiger to anyone town."}
{"text":"So, I had a bit of a surprise for lunch today. I just landed in Phoenix, I was looking for a little something to eat. I saw that Wild Thaiger was listed on DDD and on Yelp. So I decided to give it a try. The food was, in short, very delicious. The wait staff were extremely friendly. I quite enjoyed a nice leisurely little lunch. It does take a bit of time. That's because I believe they make every dish from scratch fresh. At least, that's what it looks like in the kitchen. It was so busy. But, all in all, pretty worth it. I can't wait to come back and try more. I do recommend the Dragon eggz. Try them both ways, steamed and crispy. The cheesecake was scrumptious with a tropical twist of mango."}
{"text":"I love, love, love the food! We had the ribs pineapple fried rice with chicken pad Thai & a salad shrimp roll with peanut sauce.

The people that work there are super kind and really nice, service was excellent!"}
{"text":"This place was a favorite spot of mine whenever me and my coworkers needed a good Thai meal.  Centrally located, parking always available, and the atmosphere is so relaxed.  I tend to go straight for the Pad Thai (which is a great choice here - you will not be able to eat the entire thing in one sitting, even the lunch portion), but everything else I get I enjoy as well.  The one thing that I would watch out for is time constraint.  My coworkers and I used to work right by the restaurant and were a little more flexible with our lunch hour.  However, sometimes I did have to wait a little longer than I felt I should for my food (although they may have just been very busy those few times).  All in all, a good grub spot!"}
{"text":"IF YOU CAN'T TAKE THE HEAT... 
Don't expect customer service! Don't expect them to answer the phone if they're busy during normal Business hours. They won't! And they won't apologize for it either! 

I, along with my co-workers wanted to place over 9 food orders for pick up. After several attempts to call and place our order, Wild Thaiger never picked up their phone. So I drove a few miles to place the order in person only to be told that there was a TWO-HOUR take out waiting time! I wish someone would have picked up the phone at Wild Thaiger instead of wasting my gas and time. 

JUST A LITTLE ADVICE Wild Thaiger, ALL your phone-in customer orders deserve the same respect and assistance as your dine-in customers! If you can't handle the heat, then get out of the kitchen! 

My office and I will be taking our business to Thai Hut and Thai Basil!! Maybe that'll help alleviate some of your stress, Wild Thaiger."}
{"text":"After Mexican food Thai the the most numerous type of food in the down town area. With this stiff competition offerings need to be unique.

While Thaiger is on the higher end of the down town Thai spectrum in both prices and presentation.  Most dishes are 7.95 with soup OR spring roll but not both. The vegetarian dishes are 8.95 and some of the noodle ones are closer to $10.

Service was fairly slow, less than ideal at lunch hour and surprising as they were not very busy. Another negative note is the open kitchen. I was able to see one cook use the microwave on something. Microwaves and gourmet never mix.

I had the Veggie Kiewan 8.95 with a spring roll. The spring roll was nothing special. The green curry was quite rich and thick one of the richest in town. The vegies were good as was the tofu this is all topped with a beet garnish. Overall it was a good dish.

My co workers opted for the soup. It was a curry soup with chicken in it. They said it was just ok.

Due to the slower service, microwaves and higher prices I gave it 3 vs 4 stars. If you want to impress a client for a lunch this is the thai place to go to."}
{"text":"Fantastic thai food. It took a while for our service and my thai basil was a bit salty but it still tasted really good and great service.. Its hard to find a good thai place and i like this place very well so far"}
{"text":"great drinks- curry is amazing- coconut rice is a must!!!!!!!! love the location wished they had more of a thai atmosphere as far as music goes and longer happy hour"}
{"text":"Not the best Thai food. I initially visited this place because it was on Triple D. We tried 3 different dishes
their pineapple fried rice, spicy pad thai, dumplings and  and none were extraordinary mind blowing. Their Milk Boba was average. They have a boba drink made with coconut milk and almond milk. That was probably my favorite part. The parking is a little sketchy, it's behind the building. 

This place is in downtown Phoenix and this area looks like a ghost town on the weekends."}
{"text":"We had been looking forward to trying the Wild Thaiger for months, so I was so glad we finally made it here!

Location: great, if you know what's good for you. Downtown Phoenix has amazing restaurants, and this one is conveniently off Central, south of Thomas. 

Service: mixed. The hostess let us choose a seat on the patio and was very friendly. Dinner service was not very friendly and pretty short, not totally uncommon at Asian food restaurants, but this was pretty curt. Patio service was very sporadic and we frequently found ourselves needing water or other items and there were no servers in site for ten minutes.

Food: we started with the Satay platter, which came with two chicken and beef skewers, and two pieces of shrimp. The temperature wasn't hot enough when it was served and the peanut sauce was heavy, but the overall taste was fine.

Dinner entrees were the chicken pad Thai and gai katchu. The pad Thai was just delicious, served in a huge portion with crisp sprouts and boys of peanuts. It could have used just a tad bit more heat, but hey, I live on the wild side. 
The Gai Katchu was just as good, and we ordered it hot. It was definitely spicy, but had great flavor. Could have used more chicken.

Overall: The food was delicious for the most part, but we couldn't ignore the sub-par service."}
{"text":"I was eager to come back for the pad thai. I review this place ten months ago and was impressed with their pad thai with chicken and shrimp. It seem the pricing has change this time, for shrimp, it is now $3 extra. alright, that's fine. when the dish came out, I was so disappointed. I didn't even see any shrimps and when I did find them, there was only 2!!! $3 extra for two shrimps! the presentation of the dish and taste was not the same and portion was smaller. did they have new chef or new owner? will not come back to this place"}
{"text":"Read the reviews ... and agree with most of what I have seen - food is great - service is slow - but - not painfully slow for us.  We were seated right away and received our drinks.  Food was a little slow - but they had a LARGE table - I'm sure that stressed their resources a bit.  We used the time to catch up - so all is good.   I'd much rather receive fresh, hot, tasty food than something thrown together in a hurry just to meet a speed need.  You can tell by watching the kitchen that each dish is cooked to order.  

Two of us ordered the Pad Thai, one a beef salad, and the other a peanut chicken dish.  EVERYONE was pleased with their selection.  I like mine a little spicier - and the condiment jars provided just what I wanted.  We also shared the Island Crab appetizer - and ordered a second!  

Just like Arnold... I'll be back!"}
{"text":"By far, one of, if not the best Thai Restaurant in Phoenix, Arizona. We tried all their popular dishes and every one of them wowed us. We tried other Thai restaurant in the area and none of them compare mostly just disappointments. So, if your in Phoenix and your looking for Thai cusinie this is the place to experience local ingredients with a Thai style!"}
{"text":"As a traveler of the world, I actually have been to Thailand and have tasted the local cuisine. Nothing compared BUT Thaiger Thai has it pretty close. However, I prefer my tofu steamed not fried and more spicy. I'm not an American  ( no offense to Americans out there but you guys mostly can't handle spicy food). I can handle my spice. Sadly thaiger did not out enough on. It was like putting on black pepper. Next time I will request lots of soice because the combination of flavors they use is exquisite. This place could do better and has so much potential to live up to...your competition is Ewa's in Flagstaff"}
{"text":"The Thai Food I tried was unique and different than from other Thai Places I've been too including the sister restaurant The Little Thaiger. 

We sat on the comfortable covered patio.

I tried the crispy spicy Corn Fritters. They were a little sweet, a little spicy and seemed very light in texture almost like eating a rice cake. The cucumber chutney was light and refreshing and went well with the corn fritters. I thought the fritters were very unique and never had anything like them before.

I enjoyed the 24K, it was really delicious Thai Pumpkin, Two kinds of eggplant including Thai, fresh green beans in spicy green curry. I added chicken to the dish and it was prepared well. I thought this dish was delicious but would have been much better if they just added a little fresh basil. 

My husband really enjoyed the Sliced WILD BOAR in HOT red chili sauce. 

Service was very good. We had two servers that both checked on us several times and also offered refills before we even needed them.

Tasty food but I would ask for some fresh basil next time.

3.75 stars"}
{"text":"I dined at Wild Thaiger last night with two other people. We were seated on the patio right away. We ordered three dishes and a couple of drinks. The food was great. The flavors and spice level were more authentic than a lot of Thai restaurants I have dined at. 

The four stars I am giving is for the food. Unfortunately, our service wasn't great. The server was very impatient and wanted us to order right away. My drink took about 10min as well. Thankfully the food was the redeeming factor."}
{"text":"The food here is average at best.  I am a little concerned with the overall cleanliness of the kitchen.  It is very small yet they cut flowers and do other non food related things in the same area your food is being cooked in.  I have had to sit at the bar and wait for a table.  I noticed how small the kitchen is and how they do not clean up immediately after themselves.  Some dishes are really good while others are really bad.  Any substitutions and there is a charge.  Not very friendly at all when you can charge someone $2 for peanut sauce with their meal or $1 to add onions or remove bellpeppers.  It is just a real hit or miss here."}
{"text":"Wild Thaiger was a convenient choice for quick and easy take out on a Thursday night I had no interest in cooking.  The menu is somewhat limited in my opinion - no masaman or choo chee curries and no crispy duck, which are my favorite Thai staples .  So I got an order of beef panang, an order of pad thai, and was intrigued by the dragon eggs app.

The dragon eggs were atrocious.  But the pad thai and beef panang were both good.  Not great, not mind blowing, but not horrible.  And for around $10 each they were pretty good sized portions.  I could see myself ordering take out again or actually dining in for a casual meal."}
{"text":"Ona, where are you? Why aren't you tasting the food that your cooks are putting out? Please taste your food!

I love this place and have always loved the food, until last night. We ordered four dishes for take-out and none of them tasted good. They were all bland and the pad thai would be an embarrassment to any self-respecting fan of Thai food. Ona, the owner, was on hand, but I'm surprise she would allow such low quality to ever make it to the customer.

Pad Thai was terrible... very salty, not sweet at all. I ordered mine with fried tofu, there was not one single piece of tofu anywhere in the dish. I twas a vegetarian dish and came with two small pieces of cauliflower and that was it. I couldn't believe my eyes.

I love this place so much I bring all of my out-of-town friends here to eat. When I served this food to my foodie friends yesterday, I was embarrassed and had to apologize profusely. I don't know what was going on behind the scenes yesterday, but someone wasn't doing their job in the kitchen.

Two stars today for a very poor meal last night. Hopefully it will improve and I will be able to give them four stars."}
{"text":"Second time here.  Not disappointed.  Simply delicious.  Had the veggie pad thai.  Tofu was flavorless but the rest of the dish was amazing.  Husband has chicken pad thai...superb."}
{"text":"We went for a quick lunch while I was on my lunch break. Two of us ate like kings for like $20 with their amazing Lunch Specials. I got the Peanut Chicken and my friend got one of the Beef dishes. Plating and presentation were excellent on top of that, making us feel like we really got our money's worth. Also, the soup of the day was AMAZING! It was like a Chicken Mushroom Coconut soup. Highly recommend, would go back any day."}
{"text":"Best thai food in town possibly... like many before me have said the spice is just right, the temple if fire lives up to its name and I love it. 24k while not worth it's weight in gold (seen those gold prices ?)  definitely is my favorite dish on the menu 

The one at minus is simply because the service has been spotty at best and I had one item which I thankfully forgot about which wasn't anything at all. In fact I didn't want to go back till thai Rama had that can plow in and we were at a loss. I'm most definitely glad I did go back and having said that I will keep going back . 
 
Oh and btw that mango cheese cake is the truth. That is legit and I wonder how I went through life not hiking to mix up my fav 2 things mangoes and cheese ! 

Perhaps if they fix up their service I will up it to five stars until then it's a 4.5 place"}
{"text":"I was hoping to try the food here before I left the city. Unfortunately, I was turned away at the door, even with empty tables in sight. The hostess informed our party that the restaurant was short staffed and we would have a ten minute wait. No problem. We are patient. With no other patrons waiting to be seated, we requested to sit at a table and would have no concerns about waiting for service while we rested our legs and chatted. We were refused.

In 103 degree heat, we were refused. They were unwilling to allow us to sit inside at an empty table to wait! We questioned this action and the hostess turned to the kitchen, then looked back and said she was not allowed to let us inside.

We were left with the option of standing in the heat while tables remained empty inside, or we could find a place that was willing to accommodate our party. We chose the latter. 

I'm sorry that I will never have the opportunity to review the food here. Even more, I am disappointed that the staff behavior was so appalling. The only interaction with the restaurant that I have to review- a refusal to allow us to sit at an empty table."}
{"text":"Everything was fine, just fine. Service was good, the food was good. The only reason this is a lower rating is because it did not blow me away, but I would likely eat here again."}
{"text":"We had put off going here for quite some time because we feared it would be like most Thai places in Phoenix a disappointment).....but, when we finally went were were pleasantly surprised!  The food was well prepared and there was a nice variety of items on the menu.  They even had my favorite desert, the mango and sticky rice.  We will definitely be going here again!!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible but the seating is an issue as is the hostess. When someone walks into your establishment the first thing you should do is greet them not carry on an internal conversation.   When we asked if we could wait at the bar we were told NO because someone waiting may want to sit there. Hmmm when there are 2 seats at the bar I don't think a party of 3/4 or 5 is going to manage that. Then we were told to wait out in the patio where space heaters exist but not turned in. The patio could definitely be used for serving...lost revenue and no one sitting at the bar....more lost revenue."}
{"text":"Fritter me timbers.... 

I mean, corn fritters. 

Not that this one little review makes any difference, but if you go, get the corn fritters. 

This was my second time at Wild Thaiger and how that delicious app eluded me the first time, I will never know. 

Not the biggest fan of their Pad Thai, but that's okay. There are many other very delicious options... And corn fritters."}
{"text":"Great place and loved their panang beef curry. I haven't had such a flavorful panang curry in a long time!  Might go back again this week while I am still in town!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal at this restaurant. If it were in Tucson I would get take out here regularly. I ordered the usual suspects panang curry and pad se-eiw. The flat noodles had a nice savory garlic sauce that had the right amount of sweetness. The panang curry had just the right amount of richness. The one thing I did not like was that they put the rice in the panang curry. I like my rice on the side, I don't like it drenched in the sauce before it even gets to the table."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a number of Thai restaurants in the Phoenix area, and this definitely is in the top 3.  The food is great as was the service and it has a cozy patio if you enjoy eating outside or are a smoker.  The price was also reasonable.   They do serve alcohol, although I'm not sure if it was full bar or beer/wine service only."}
{"text":"Many great dishes but the stand out for me: the freshie rolls! The best gluten-free spring rolls in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Service sucks but the food is so worth it we have been coming here for years!!!! It's awesome and the best Thai food we have found. I just wish they accepted reservations."}
{"text":"Service blows.  Got here a few minutes past the lunch hour and tried to order the lunch special.  The server was rude and denied my request referring me to the dinner menu which was several dollars more and did not come with soup or spring roll.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I was so excited to eat here after watching the food channel and then very disappointed when we came here. Don't get me wrong the staff was friendly and the atmosphere was nice. We chose to eat outside because it was beautiful. We ordered the pork hash and it was delicious. I got a chicken fried rice. I was disappointed in the selection for that and other items. We got the ribs. That was awesome. Mango cheesecake is a cheesecake with mango on top of it. I guess I was expected it to be cooked into it. 

Overall the food is mediocre nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"First off, love Wild Thaiger, food is excellent, service is by in large prompt, courteous, and a relaxed atmosphere. 

However, I had a bad experience, where I witnessed a cockroach walking across the bar in front of me. I voiced my concern to Ola, she couldn't find it. But apologized. I was dissatisfied with this response and wrote her an email expressing my concerns. This is her appropriate, professional abbreviated response.

\"As a regular you know we have an \"A\" rating because we don't have a pest problem.  I will be glad to share the pest inspection reports and monthly service schedule for the last eight years which we have been in business.  It would be a perfect world if I could afford to have enough staff to open all of our boxes in the parking lot and stock all of our products individually to ensure that unwanted pests do not enter our doors. Of course we have discontinued purchasing product from the supplier and they are aware of the problem.\"

She refunded my money, and we're satisfied, moved on. 

I show up today with my party---and she pulls me out of the restaurant, tells me that \"i'm not supporting her business\" and that a few days after my email she gets an inspection from the Maricopa County Health Department, and they gave her a \"B\" rating. She proceeds to accuse me of calling them, and blaming me for her low grade. I inform her that I dealt with her straight, communicated directly with her, and I considered it resolved. At this point she tells me she won't serve me anymore after being a customer for about seven years.

Having never dealt with the Maricopa Environmental Services, I'm not really aware with how they schedule their inspections but clearly it was a coincidence that it occurred 6 days later. I guess Ola never thought perhaps it was a different customer, or in fact that maybe it was scheduled every 3 months?

At any rate her reaction to customer feedback is not only unprofessional but just makes bad business sense. 

Poor decision Ola, I'm really surprised your sanitation problem, and failing an inspection is blamed on your customers."}
{"text":"Ate there recently and the service was very poor: it took 20 minutes to get even a glass of water; others who were seated after us had orders taken before us; and then the food took a long time as well. Choose a different restaurant."}
{"text":"I want to give Wild Thaiger a 5 star because I really love their Pad Thai and spicy fried rice. Seriously, probably best Pad Thai I've ever had. However, there are a few downfalls. The dragon eggs that every one and their mothers seem to rave about were actually very underwhelming. Also, the crab appetizer isn't very good either. You can tell that it's just crab from a can which I'm not down for. Their desserts and drinks are nothing to brag about either. 

We tried their yellow curry one time too when my wife and I went to dinner with our friends and the yellow curry was pretty delish! Also, they have a very confusing seating system where they will have tables available but they won't sit you yet until the kitchen can catch up with the orders. This is kinda strange but at the same time at least that means that they are making all the food fresh. If your looking for some good Thai food in central Phoenix you gotta hit this place up."}
{"text":"Family birthday dinner.  Everyone loved their food.  Not very much for vegetarians... very little in fact.  Otherwise, nice experience again."}
{"text":"Came here for  lunch today with the family after a morning hike,  good food, hit the spot! I had the chicken pad thai with a spring roll and a nice cold Kirin Light beer. Took about 30 mins or so for our food to come out, so don't come here if your looking to have a quick lunch. Sit outside on the patio, relax and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is incredible. I have been coming here for two years. The food was ok sometimes.  They always messed up the order. I felt always being treated bad and had to wait for my order or food for 30-40 min even when I call ahead. 

So tonight I waited for 30 min the waitress never came and then I went to her she said she was told the manager said not to serve me and she should be afraid of my kind of people. I'm middle eastern and brownish. 

I was so hurt the waitress With the blue hair laughed and said the manager can serve anyone they like. The other waitress made a mistake and showed me a note on with my name on it stating not to serve me or my people !!

what they don't know is I order for my staff once or twice a week over 200$ but I always have someone else pick it up. NEVER AGAIN 


VERY HURTFUL  

RACISM IS ALIVE AND WELL IN 2018. 

Very sad. I will not ever support this establishment and I hope you  don't either. 

Racist people come in all shape and ethnicities. DO NOT EAT THERE. 

I'm attaching a picture that was taped on the wall not serve me."}
{"text":"I went Sunday night February 18, 2018 with friends for dinner.  We asked the server for a description of various dishes,  At best, we got one-word descriptions.  She clearly was not interested in helping us.  We had no drink refills the entire meal.  Upon getting ready to pay and leave the server disappeared for at least 15 minutes with our credit cards.  Now  I am going to have to put a fraud alert on my credit card because   who only knows what she was doing with my credit card.  We asked to speak to a manager which took another 15 minutes.  We finally got someone named Dave, who was indifferent  about our complaints. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Just came across this restra while searching for some good thai food. The veggie sampler whetted my apetite  awesum loved it nd feeling bit high after having saki cosmo; the tofu tower doesn't tower up my expectations. Now finally heading towards main course,..dnt knw hw  they make it but their curry is alwys awesum"}
{"text":"I have only been here once, but what I ate was awesome! I love that it's right off the light rail too. We did a \"rail day\" not too far back where we just jumped on the rail and tweeted as we went. Following recommendations from fellow twitter users we stopped here for lunch and ended up at the heard museum (also right off the rail). All in all a really great day. Good food, good people and a little culture. Gotta recommend all of it!

If you're riding the rail and are in the mood for some thai, this is the place! :)"}
{"text":"So surprised that this place wasn't more expensive and that we didn't have to wait for a table. Delish!!"}
{"text":"I'm here to review MY experience and THE FOOD.
Came here during a week night. 
Found parking.
No waiting.
Courteous host.
Fast service.
Good food -temperature, flavor, presentation, portion size, price-.

I'm definitely recommending this place and the food. Will be back my next trip to AZ. I had: dragon eggs (crispy), curry chicken and coconut rice. All good."}
{"text":"Delicious thai food.  I tried the tom yum soup which was very flavorful and delicious but a touch on the salty side.  The pad thai noodles were also awesomely chewy and came with tons of mix-ins on the side like peanuts, cabbage, bean sprouts, beets, and cilantro.  A bit too much sauce was on the noodles today, but adding the veggies really helped.  Next time I'm hoping to try the durian ice cream as well ;p"}
{"text":"I did not even know this place was on DDD before I tried it today! I have not had much experience with Thai food before, but I did enjoy trying this place out. I sat outside and it was nice, not too crowded on a Wednesday night.
Our orders were taken pretty quickly, I can't remember the name of the dish I ordered, but it was tofu and vegetables in a coconut broth. Was served in a metal bowl that had a flame in the middle which was pretty crazy. Was a little bit difficult for me to ladle the soup from the metal thing into the bowl without making a huge mess. But it went ok! The food was delicious. It was not spicy at all though. Also there were a few slices of what looked like potato in there, and it wasn't potato. It was sliced ginger, and eating that big of a hunk of ginger is not really a pleasant experience. Otherwise, I enjoyed it! Was not too expensive, I'm sure it would be a great place to come for lunch too."}
{"text":"Tacky looking establishment and terrible service. Is this place a joke? There are better places nearby. And don't bother calling g for takeout - they act like they can't understand because they're \"so busy.\" Place looks kinda unpopular to me since I had to walk in to order food. Ugh this place is the worst."}
{"text":"I came here because of Guy. The Dragon's Eggs were great. I also ordered the chicken Pad Thai and I liked the noodles better than the meat. I would come back."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Survivor - Eye of the Tiger)

Risin' up, back on the street
Did my time at work, took my chances
Went the distance
Now I'm back from my meetings
Just a man and his hunger for some Thai

So many times, it happens too fast
You trade your passion for quick bite
Don't lose your taste on the heat of the spice
You must fight just to keep them alive

It's the food of the Wild Thaiger
It's the scent of the spice
Risin' up to the challenge
Of our belly
And the Yelper known for his song
Orders his plate always right
And he's reviewing with his
Eye on the Wild Thaiger


Wild Thaiger is locally own family restaurant located around the downtown area of Phoenix.  Chef and owner Olashawn Hasadinratana-Weaver brings the traditional flare of Thai food to modern day Phoenix.  Wild Thaiger has had many TV personalities visit the place, but also celebrities that come by PHX.  I know because of the pictures posted in the back wall - haha!  Decorated with traditional Thai art; Wild Thaiger tries to emulate that Thailand feel along with your cuisine.  

I've been here several times once for dinner and once for Happy Hour.  I'm a big fan of the fried noodles mainly Pad See Ew - Stir-fried fat noodles with your choice of protein; chicken, beef, or pork; and of course vegetables.  Seems pretty simple, but this dish packs a punch of aroma and spice.  It's usually fried in a garlic sauce and the amount of heat is based on how much you can handle.  I can't do the Thai spice I'll admit so I always do the medium.  In any case, Wild Thaiger deliveries with the Pad See Ew along with their traditional Pad Thai dish.  Another stir-fried noodle, but this one is with the skinny noodles and it's much sweeter.

Overall, I would come here for Happy Hour because they have 1/2 off appetizers.  Their selection of Thai beer is always interesting something I think you need to try for you beer connoisseurs out there.  Service is always tops and the kitchen which is open for your viewing is spotless - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went there with a group I'm in.   I had been there before and wasn't all that impressed, but it has been a few years so I thought I'd give it another shot.   I had the yellow chicken curry.   It was okay.   They add some kind of thickener to the sauce, which I don't like it when thai restaurants do that.    Just let the sauce stand on its own.   You don't need to thicken it.   Thankfully, the chicken was not boiled, which is what I had in another Asian restaurant I reviewed.   Ughhh!!  Gross!!   I think twice is enough to try it out, no matter how many years in between."}
{"text":"Great, authentic Thai food in the heart of Phoenix. They are always packed which is a true testament to their food! The service is always exceptional as well. The only downside is DDD was just there last week so expect a much longer wait once the episode airs!"}
{"text":"This is a review by a vegetarian.

Also, a review by a single strait main. This may have influenced the star rating and tip because the server was , um, worth a star.

Had the veggie platter. I do appreciate veggie icons on menus to help me scan.

The corn cakes were crispy and not greasy. Though I thought that was an indonesian dish, not thai. Not complaining just trying to figure things out. Ditto goodness on the veggie spring rolls and spicy dipping sauce. Tofu skewers themselves were good but I can and do make a better peanut sauce than that. Just use the spicy sauce for everything on the place.

So that's 3 stars for food and decent price and 1 star for server fantasies + large clean bathroom + convenient parking in the back.

Bonus hygiene: saw cats milling around the rear door of the NEXT restaurant over. So that place lures all the varmints assuring cleanliness at Wild Thaiger."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for dessert one day and were in a hurry. They sat us right away (they were slammed 5 minutes to close!) made our dessert, cashed us out in under 10 minutes. And it was delicious! Mango with sweet rice is my favorite!"}
{"text":"My brother recommended this spot and I'm so happy to have found a delicious Thai spot in AZ for future visits. Beautiful restaurant I would love to dine in next time.  We placed a takeout order during a recent visit. The young lady who helped us was so sweet and super helpful. She even accomodated a special request in making a pad woon sen for us even though it was not on their menu specifically. Fried rice, panang, Pad Thai,  Thai Tea, everything we tried was delicious! If you are new to Thai flavors, this place is great!!  We requested not too spicy and the flavors were just perfect. When I saw that they were featured on Guy Fieri's Diners Driveins and Dives from The Food Network, that made me even more excited to try this place.  I hope to find their episode sometime to watch it. Amazing customer service and a beautiful space to dine inside and outside. Look forward to returning!!!  Ample parking in a private lot behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"Food always great!!  One of the BEST!  But the interior remodel is aweful. The fish tank is such a bad statement. Makes the place look cheap and looks more like other crappy Thai restaurants. Poor choice in a remodel. 86 the fish tank."}
{"text":"Overrated. Service was slow, food was mediocre and a bit pricey for the service/food you get. I had satay chicken and the meat was dry and the sauce was crumbly. Then I ordered the pad-see-ew and it was super salty."}
{"text":"Wifey and I hit the Wild Thaiger up after a trip to the Phx Museum of Art. great choice. Friendly service and modern decor. The food was excellent. Phoenix is lucky to have this place."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my friend. 

We got the dragon eggs for appetizers which were very similar in look and taste to Chinese dim sum Siu Mais. The appetizers came out a few minutes after we ordered them. They had jalapeno slices on top though in what appears to be soy sauce. We also ordered thai teas and I ordered an additional watermelon mojito. They were pretty good. The thai teas were good and not as sugary as what I usually get whenever I have a thai tea that has been drenched in creamer. The watermelon mojito was poured a little heavy which, is usually how I have my liquor and had chunks of watermelon in it. Very good. Then my order or chicken pad thai came after I downed my watermelon mojito. 

The time between finishing the appetizers and mojito to when my food arrived was about 7 minutes during lunch time rush...actually pretty good since they were about full inside the restaurant. I'm pretty sure nobody wanted to sit outside in 107 degree weather. Pad thai was delicious but not spicy. It is on the menu as one pepper rating or medium spicy. I usually get thai hot but was pretty hung over from heavy drinking into the morning so I figured getting thai hot was probably not a good idea. 

Over all, a very good experience. Service was fast. Food was delicious and waitress was attentive. Pricing isn't bad but not like super cheap. I would come here again. Parking is decent and in back of the restaurant. I would imagine that during lunch time that parking might be tough to find since you technically can't park in the lot to the left of the restaurant...technically, lol."}
{"text":"The Veggie Spring Rolls were really good!  Our entrees were also delicious & our service was very good.  This is for sure my new spot for Thai food in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Excellent!

I grew up on Malee's on Main which I think is the best. Living in Tempe & Scottsdale for years...

Having moved to the central corridor I discovered Wild Thaiger. 
As good if not better! Bomb!

Was able to chat with the owner last visit. Love that! She's charming!

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This cute place is located in downtown Phoenix slightly north of the Heard Museum. It's on Central, easily access via light rail. There is private parking but it's right next to a public lot and can be confusing. Beware to avoid parking in the public parking lot since it requires payment. 

The restaurant itself has Asian inspired interior and appeared to be well maintained. They have a shady, quaint outdoor patio with normal table seating and also lounge seating. They have full table service for both indoor and out. 

Customer service was mixed. One of our servers was a little short and wasn't helpful with the menu. Another one of our servers was very kind and attentive. The food was prepared very quickly so wait was minimal. The food itself was average. I enjoyed the flavors and thought the dishes were presented well. However, the flavor was average and the curry was served on a dish, which I think is mildly annoying since it's a bunch of fluid spread over a large surface area. The items come with a default spicy level but can be changed to cater your taste."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. A friend brought me here when I was visiting from out of town and I was really impressed. This may be my new favorite Thai food place. They have a ton of creative options on the menu that look delicious. When I told the waiter I was a vegetarian, he said that they could make 90% of things vegetarian. I asked whether that included using beef broth and fish sauce and he clarified that they use vegetarian broth and a veggie substitute for the fish sauce for all of the veggie dishes. Amazing! I got a delicious noodle dish that I'm now craving again. My friend got peanut chicken and sticky rice with mango, both of which looked delicious. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We went here bc it was on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives! Yum!! Tried the pork skewers and the spicy seafood fantasy dish. Really, really good. The jasmine coconut rice is delicious:-)"}
{"text":"I Was really impressed with the service and the food. Papaya salad... Yes please. I took an extra order home with me. Their coconut ice cream was amazing too!
Parking was a little shady, however that's what DT phoenix offers for parking. greeted with a smile at the door and everything was very organized. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a Thai restaurant to replace the legends in Portland and this is the closest replacement I've found. Overall I was pretty impressed in the food. Their version of spicy wasn't very spicy but they had bowls of dried pepper powder to help me adjust the temperature to my liking. I will be visiting again."}
{"text":"I actually want to get this place zero stars but that is not an option. I went here with my family my aunt and uncle words are from out-of-town and I had suggested this place because I have had the food there before and it was very good. We got to the restaurant at a decent time on a Monday night there was three other tables, we asked to down in one of the empty booths but she told us that we could not. That we had to wait. . We looked around and couldn't figure out why it was a 25 minute wait. We said okay we would like to sit down the bar and have a drink my uncle and aunt enjoy a nice glass of wine. The waitress who was very rude, told us that if we sat down at the bar to have a glass of wine that we cannot sit at a table. We looked to her completely confused she said that we could not dirty two areas of the restaurant. I couldn't believe what I was hearing! We said okay and could we sit at a table, that we will stay at for dinner,  we will understand if they couldn't get to us for the 25 minutes we can still sit and have a drink, she said no we have to stand there or sit on the bench waiting for a table for the 25 minutes or we cannot eat there!!!!  We left the restaurant and I will never return. I have now read the reviews how the service has sank. It's sad because it was a very enjoyable place at one time. Big fat F for this place."}
{"text":"Great choice for lunch in Phoenix! I ordered the Pad Thai which was the perfect amount of spice. I've never finished an entire plate at a Thai restaurant, but I did here. The portion was decent but not gigantic like other restaurants in the area. 

Everyone's food looked fabulous at our table, I can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"I have only been to Wild Thaiger a few times and have eaten food they catered for a private buffet dinner at the restaurant most of those times. The Pad Thai is a favorite of mine. I love their Iced Thai Tea. The atmosphere is nice, the service is top notch and the food is constantly good. They also have a full bar with happy hour."}
{"text":"Went there on a first friday night, they were slammed but the waitress was still very attentive.  We ordered pad thai, tom ka gai and sticky rice, all three were delicious!  Great patio too."}
{"text":"DDD gave this place rave reviews.  It was crowded.  No doubt because of DDD.  The item Guy loved was \"no available\" when we were there.  I would have left if I had been alone, but it was girls lunch so we all ordered something different to taste each other's food.  100% disappointment all around.  The staff was rude and inattentive.  They were busy.  But I've worked in restaurants, staff should be nicer when they are busy because we waited forever for our drinks...then our food...then her food...then her food...then chopsticks... you get the idea. One of us was almost done before mine even arrived at the table. This is Emperors New Clothes for sure.  I just want all of you to know the Emperor is naked and all the food we tasted was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Kind of regret going here. Female servers had major attitude. They all look related. Food was good but entree portion was super small and overpriced. Won't be coming back. Sorry."}
{"text":"Been here twice.  Loved it both times!  Actually today, my brother mentioned he has been there for dinner and wants to take us there to try it.  We beat him to this place.  Now, we just need to pick a date for dinner.  I can not wait!!!"}
{"text":"In the land where many of the Thai restaurants simply rotate proteins, carbs and a standard vegetable medley, Wild Thaiger dishes out more authentic versions of traditional Thai specialties.  I'm a huge fan, especially given that it's proof in and of itself that Thai food is more than just a combo plate - it's an explosion of flavors amalgamated into unique and colorful profiles and textures.  It's an adventure.

Wild Thaiger offers some of my favorites that are not to be found at Thai Basil (so mediocre) and Thai Elephant (good but standard) - Dragon's Eggs are a spin on Kanom Jeeb, thai pork and crab dumplings similar to shu mai, graced with a spicy slice of raw jalapeno on top.  Decha Boar celebrates the not often served wild boar in a peppery sauce of basil and telicherry peppercorns.  They understand that pepper can be flavorful in addition to hot, and there's a whole taste profile there just waiting for you to explore.  Best of all, the presentation on the dishes is a work of art - ribbons of carrots and beets as edible garnishes remind you of what a treat it should be to dine out.

If you are looking for standard Thai, without flair or panache, I could see how this might be seen as too expensive.  But for my money, I'd rather blow my tastebuds out of the park with a mindful chef who prepares her curries and sauces with finesse and grace.  Yum to the freakin' yum."}
{"text":"We visited (party of 3) on June 23rd.  Arrived at 5:50 p.m. and were immediately sat (inside - too hot to bed outside).  

Pro's:  the presentation of the food was amazing!  Presentation was only outdone by the taste - all entree's were very delicious.  I had the Gai Katchu and honestly wanted to lick the plate clean to get the remainder of the sauce!  We split a hefty slice of the Mango Cheesecake - it was simply yummy!  The staff were very friendly and made wonderful recommendations.

Con's:  it was a little dark and as time went by, all the inside seating was full and the noise level was too high to have a normal conversation - we almost had to yell at each other in order to be heard.  As others have noted, there was simply not enough staff considering the number of guests.  We ordered our drinks at 6:00 p.m. - delivered at 6:20 p.m.  When delivered, we placed both our appetizer (house salad) and entree orders.  The salads arrived at 6:40 p.m. with out entrees arriving at 6:55 p.m.  The staff was very friendly - just need more staff!  

Looking forward to returning - and even if there is a long wait - at least I know the food will be delicious and make it worth the wait."}
{"text":"I am visiting Phoenix and found this gem. The pad thai is one of the best I have in years! Will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Pretty good but not tons of veggie-based options.  

Parking: Though it does not seem like it, there are plenty of parking spots when you drive towards the back of the restaurant. That said, if it got super busy, I do not know where folks would park. 

Service: It's OK...it varies depending on when I've gone.  That said, if you want to linger and chat, the servers do not hover or make you feel like you should leave, which is nice. 

Seating: Booths/tables, bar, and outdoor patio. The outdoor patio is nice but can be noisy with passing traffic, and the light rail passes often with its bells. 

Food: I do not eat meat, so that poses limitations for my intakes.  That said, I chose a dish that had eggplant (I dislike eggplant), and they were able to add whatever veggies I requested.  The dish also contained pumpkin, which was not very good, but the broccoli and other veggies were tasty.   I have been here before and ordered the Tom Yum soup, which is often my testing point of a Thai restaurant. It's quite good and extra spicy.   My date ordered some meat-based dish. He seemed to enjoy it.  

I have ordered appetizers here before and enjoy the fresh rolls and corn fritters.   The corn fritters are super greasy, though. 

The cost seems rather decent for a restaurant of this caliber."}
{"text":"Went to Wild Thaiger two nights ago, I have been before, but my girlfriend had not. I love Thaiger so I wanted to share the tastiness. I figured I would write a review since I have not yet.

Wild Thaiger is in the heart of uptown Phoenix. Central and Thomas area. Cool little restaurant with a nice atmosphere inside.

Food is great and very fresh. I like that you can see the entire kitchen from most of the tables in the restaurant. They have nothing to hide. Prices are pretty standard at between 8.95-14.95 for dinner entrees. 

Great food and wonderful service. Nice change from other Thai restaurants in Tempe, Chandler, Mesa, etc."}
{"text":"I've gotta say, not super impressed. The spot is cute and the food is ok. I got the chicken pad Thai and spring rolls. Spring rolls were kind of soggy. The pad Thai was good though. Really flavorful. Could have done without all the cilantro and garnishment. I prefer Thai Basil."}
{"text":"We spent 20 minutes here tonight waiting to be sat only to walk out...

We were told it would be about 15 mins. We waited patiently at the hostess stand, while a seemingly harried and unorganized staff ran around between the indoor and outdoor spaces. Various tables were empty and not being bussed, and another table was actually cleaned and ready. No clue what was going on...there was no one at the hostess stand, no apparent 'leader' to be seen. 

Hoping it was just an off night...when I return to give them a second chance I still update my review"}
{"text":"Dragon balls-deep fried shumai type appetizer. The solid pork shrimp filling reminded me of a super mashed meat formed into a ball. I didn't see what everyone thought was so special. 

Tilapia with green curry- 5 stars. Excellent pieces of tilapia, crisp not super greasy crust. Intricate curry ingredients but not sure if the green curry paste was home made, I think it's the canned variety.

Dessert pancake/roti- 1 star, frozen Malaysian parathas which were undercooked and doughy. I was disappointed as this dessert is rare to come by at Thai restaurants in the US"}
{"text":"The white chocolate raspberry cheesecake is a masterpiece.  Yes, this Thai restaurant has the best cheese cake I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  We went here to try something different and I'm glad we did.  It is kinda far for us but it was well worth it.  Cute place, has a nice outdoor patio, small inside but that doesn't bother us.  I'm just glad it wasn't super busy.  We went on a Saturday night and we were sat right away.  Ordered a few drinks and it did take some time to get them but that's ok.  The employees were all busy and doing their job.  We ordered the Dragon Eggs for an app and did half steamed/half fried and they were AWESOME.  I would definitely recommend them.  For dinner I had Mu Yang, which was INCREDIBLE.  The sticky rice, OH MY, I wish I could have some with every dinner.  My boyfriend ordered the ribs and he loved them.  I tried them myself and I thought they were super tasty.  Everything we ordered had so much flavor, which is huge in our book.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This truly is a jewel from the east. The food is exceptional and fair priced. The Thai tea is to die for and the chicken do good. Parking is a bit tricky but the place is good. If you're looking for authentic Thai food then this is the place to go. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend.  Shrimp Pad Thai was the best. Would love to try the Mango Cheesecake next time."}
{"text":"Wow! 
This restaurant is fabulous!  The food is very authentic and savory.  With a huge menu selection and warm sweet smiles this now a favorite place to dine. 
I like spice and fresh ingredients and I was totally in love with every bite. 
Thai flavored are among the most complex and delightful in the world and this place delivers a rich and satisfying meal. Portions are big and presentation perfection.  Service is fast and friendly. 
Feels and tastes like being in a gourmet restaurant in Thailand.  
Love Love Love it!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to the Thaiger. Service was terrible. I won't get into that the biggest disappointment was the amount of microwave use. Nothing was really fresh. The waitress had to cash me out with her wallet. To bad."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and I must say that the customer service and food are inconsistent.  One time I had the pad-se-eew and panang, which was good.  The service was great.  Then there was another time I came and the service was lacking.  We weren't even acknowledged for quite some time.  I ordered the pad-se-eew and all I can taste is crunchy garlic bits.  It was horrible.  I took it back and they replaced it.  I also strongly advise to not order the thai iced tea."}
{"text":"Food was very good but the service was slow. Even though our server was nice, it took too long for our food too come out."}
{"text":"We followed Guy's record momentarily on the food at it was great. Would recommend the Dragon Eggs, steamed and fried. Was not expecting to love the papaya salad but it was excellent also. Pad Thai was ok, Thai ribs were very tender and the chicken on the sticks was great. Would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"I have been to the Wild Thaiger several times and I decided I should write a review because it is such a great restaurant. I went for lunch this time and the service was great. Although it was slightly loud, the food more than made up for it. Started out with lettuce wraps and ended with pad Thai. It was amazing! Very tasty :)"}
{"text":"Still my favorite Pad Thai in Arizona.  I normally just get pad thai from any thai place I visit but my friends got me to try the beef panang and it is really excellent.  I love this place.  The wait for your food can be long at lunch but its worth it."}
{"text":"This was the first Thai food I had since my trip to Thailand and it was very good.  I liked that they have Thai servers, it made the food more authentic.  It can get very busy and loud especially at lunch time.  

I would recommend the Thai Tea, all beer they have is tasty, and everything i've ordered food wise was delicious."}
{"text":"Like any small restraunt it pays to go at the right time. I personally love The Wild Thaiger, their food tastes authentic and is equally delicious. Love their variety of Asian Beer served in Frosted Glass. But it is true I have waited a long time for service once, lucky me and my partner weren't in a hurry. Wait staff can be nice just depends who it is. Try there Mango Schnaps drink--wowee--Time will fly in a jiffy then."}
{"text":"The food was good, but  maybe we should have left when they could not describe any of the menu items to us, may been a language barrier but even so they need to know how to explain to a customer what they're ordering. We have been here before service and food was very good. This was a Saturday night not overly busy there at 5 o'clock the service was nonexistent No refills on coffee, iced tea, water asked for them never got them and then to kick it all off they took a credit card and were  gone for 15 minutes. When we tried to talk to the manager about it he was lackadaisical and didn't seem to care about any of it he said well what do you want me to do did not offer to talk to his waitstaff did not offer anything it took him more then 10 minutes we asked if we were going to get to the talk to the manager and she said well he's busy and I said well if he's too busy to come and speak with us I mean I can go ahead and post a review on yelp and other places without talking to him. He finally did come up by his lackadaisical attitude in the customer service field was beyond my anything I have experienced in a long time and phone calls will be made tomorrow."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. It was the fact that we stood there for twenty minutes and no one, literally, no one acknowledged our presence. We sat ourselves in a reserved table, and they told us they were short a cook and that was the reasoning behind the reservation signs. I would have rather been seated, had them explain the lack in staff and just waited longer for my food. This situation could have been handled in a more tactful manner. I will try again, hopefully I can give it five stars next time."}
{"text":"I came in right when they opened. There was quite a line before they opened, and even once we got in it took a bit for us to get any sort of service. 

I ordered the Gaprao Gai. They really don't mess around with their heat level. Be careful! The dish itself was very tasty, and once the lunch rush calmed down service was wonderful (and constant enough to get my water filled up often).

All in all, tasty food, good service. If you are in the area it is worth a shot. Otherwise there are better Thai places around the valley (Chanpen comes to mind...)."}
{"text":"We waited 45 minutes for our food. I asked how much longer it would take and was told up to 10 more minutes. I asked if the management would give us a discount for the wait. I saw our very friendly waitress approach her manager who was clearly annoyed by the question  (we made eye contact more than once). The waitress came back and said she was really sorry but they can't do anything about the wait because everyone else is waiting too. So we canceled our order, and they made us pay for the tea we drank!
Now I know it wasn't much but when I've had a problem like this at other restaurants, the manager always comes over to the table and hears the grievance personally. The wait staff was great but the management was sloppy and hands off.
So we drove all the way to Siam Thai (which was pretty busy) and had an excellent meal which was served promptly."}
{"text":"I would never imagine a dine-out could turn into a torment. But I experienced it at Wilder Thaiger. Mind the skinny young Asian waitress."}
{"text":"Decided to visit this place because a friend of mine just started working here, Kristin, she alone is worth a visit to this place. Kristin has such an upbeat personality and a beautiful smile, make sure you ask her when you go and tell her Amber sent ya !!

The restaurant has a huge patio facing Central Ave and the inside is decorated very tastefully. They have a nice selection of wines, specialty cocktails, and beer ( mostly Asian imports ). 

My husband and I ordered :

The Temple of the Thaiger- delicious and described as a party in your mouth, and it was. Perfectly seasoned chicken layered on fried won tons.

Satay Sampler- This was shrimp, chicken, and beef covered in a peanut sauce and was very yummy.

Freshie Rolls- we had the chicken and the veggie and both were soooooo good, this is a must try !

Jasmine rice- steamed to perfection.

All food is made to order and is fresh and delicious. This is a family owned and operated business with Thai born chefs that really know what they're doing. It is a little pricey for Thai food, but the quality and flavor make it worth it. They also have several lunch specials for $7.95 from 11-2 Monday thru Friday."}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended by our friends and we were hoping to also like it. First off, I called and asked if I could bring a small birthday cake for my husband's birthday. The lady on the phone said it was not an issue. We got there and it was packed on a Friday night. The hostess said it would be 20 minutes for a table. Literally two seconds later, there was a four person table cleared. I asked for the table and she got someone to clean it for us. The place was busy and noisy.  The menu was limited and average priced for most items. I craved noodles so ordered the Pad-Seiw. The noodles were alright. Somehow seems like there should be basil in the dish and not a bunch of cauliflower. The hubby had the bbq chicken with coconut rice.  Later our server later came back to tell us that they were going to charge us 5 dollars for bringing our own cake. Nice how that was not mentioned on the phone or when she first took the cake to the fridge for us.  So sadly we will not be returning. Thai Rama has much better food and service."}
{"text":"I'm truly disgusted by the service of this restaurant.  I came in with my family (Mom and Dad) and they said 10 minute wait, we said okay, we notice that they were short with their staff so we waited patiently till we were seated at a table, but that 10 minutes turned into a 30min wait. So the hostess sat us at a table saying how there may be awhile wait, after seeing 2 servers walk by us like we didn't exist, the hostess later seated another table which were 4 Caucasian customers, we were still patiently waited for around another 30min, when those 4 sat down an Asian waiter quickly came to take their order, I got the waiters attention and said excuse me, we came here first. And she made up an excuse saying how \"Oh we wait on different tables probably your waiter is busy\" I knew this was an excuse, I was so disgusted. So we told the hostess that this waiter is waiting on a table after us, and she said oh well we said there would probably be a long wait, and the hostess had the audacity to say \"Oh but they serve the people who come before\" and I said, we were before them, we been waiting 30min at this table and you know this because you sat us at our table\" she said it depends. So in the end we left the restaurant hungry and went to a much better restaurant which served us very well, called Rice Paper."}
{"text":"Oh, Gaprao Gai, how I love thee.  Nom."}
{"text":"Good God.   Really?  If I lived here I would eat there once every week.   I got the green papaya salad with tamarind sauce to start.  I have had this in other places but they can't hold a candle to these guys.  My entrée was the Peanut Passion.   Thin sliced, perfectly cooked chicken with a nice peanut sauce on a bed of fresh cooked veggies with a nice amount of white rice.... I just ate and my mouth is watering.

The knocks?  The dirty martini was poorly constructed and the bar top was a bit dirty.   I would not take a star off though because this is 6 star on a 5 star scale.   Do yourself a favor and eat here not corduroy"}
{"text":"You wouldn't expect it, but the ribs here are amazing.  The fried tofu is great, the sauce they have is sweet and sour, but a nice bitter note to cut it off(for another bite).  I really love spicy food, so I enjoy being able to just get the spiciest versions of their dishes."}
{"text":"The food last Friday was terrific. Local friends took us. I like Thai but am not well versed. I tried the Gai Katchu and cleaned my plate. I asked them to bump it up to 2 chiles and it gave just enough heat w/out burning later on. I also tried the Thai iced tea as recommended by our friends. It is sweet, but not too much, and fantastic. Service average +."}
{"text":"Definitely not your regular Thai place...lots of unique dishes and beautiful presentation.  Good food, friendly wait staff, cozy interior, and nice patio.  Perhaps it's the trendy-ness of the restaurant or the presence of a little one attached to me but I don't find myself saying \"Let's go to Wild Thaiger\" that often anymore.  Definitely more of a trendy \"date night\" romantic spot than a kid-friendly casual place!"}
{"text":"This is tasty Thai in the heart of downtown Pheonix. However, it's not very spicy!! And they were reluctant to give us the good stuff ie. chopped Thai chilis in fish sauce. But when we turned up the heat it was much better. You must try the 24K pumpkin curry which has a very rich and flavorful sauce. Drink the coconut cove cocktail if you love coconut water - it's SO refreshing if your sitting on the hot patio. Also, the pad Thai is a bit sweet so ask for limes to squeeze into it. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Visiting from San Diego and this place didn't disappoint. Fresh ingredients, great portions for the price. Excellent customer service. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"We went here for a second time with all 3 of our kids last night and it was a big hit. The first time was with just our daughter who was around 1 at the time. It was a pleasant experience with good service. Last night we brought my 9 year old step daughter who is the pickiest eater I have ever seen. She ordered a noodle dish with sweet soy sauce (she tried to get it without soy sauce but the waitress convinced us it would have no flavor). When it came she made a face but then tried it and loved it! I also had some and was very impressed. It had a lot of fresh veggies and a generous amount of chicken. The veggie spring rolls were also a hit with her and my now 2.5 year old and 9 month old. It was kid friendly. The Tom Kah soup was delicious (my fiancé's favorite!) and we split the ribs which fell of the bone and were so tender. The kids fried chicken meal was generous and both kids loved it. The vegetables were all fresh. And the waitress was sweet. We will come back!"}
{"text":"It's hard to go wrong with Thai food. So we deviated from our regular spot to check this place out. 

The food was okay, we got a couple staple items (regular chicken curry, and chicken and mushroom coconut soup) the curry was good, but lacked spice. The soup had a little more heat , but still not enough and lacked flavor honestly. 

The service was slow, but not too bad. They were certainly polite. 

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either."}
{"text":"I love this placetry the coconut drink .nice atmosphere and food is great . Would recommend this place for sure"}
{"text":"I ordered the Beef Panang... Yum! Now you might be thinking it's really hard to mess up a staple Thai dish but you can. It was very delicious and the beef was very tender. Most places you go the beef is dry and overcooked. The only complaint I had was that I wish it was a bit spicer. But that's easily fixable. I would definitely come back and try the other dishes."}
{"text":"I have to go with a solid 4 stars on this one because even if the food is not spicy enough for you, there are so many other reasons to love it.

The atmosphere is great.  I like everything from the tables and booths to the patio.  It is easy to hang out and have a good meal with friends, or to tuck yourself away in a corner...

The service has always been top notch for me.  I have been there when I was in a hurry, and I was able to eat and run without having to beg for service.  I also have had long leisurely dinners and was always happy with the attentive, but not pushy service.

I LOVE their pad thai.  It's a little different from the other places I have gone, in a good way.

I'm only sorry they have had such a time with the construction outside their door.  a nice place doesn't deserve that hassle."}
{"text":"Honest private business, honest price, superb food!! Second time here. No disappointment!"}
{"text":"The food is ok.  The much promoted Dragon eggs are nothing more than a Chinese siu mai (deep fried or steamed) with a jalapeño on top of it.  All the dishes we ordered, standard...have really no spice level or flavor in the meat.  The service is ok. I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here, to me this was a miss even if Guy Fieri featured on Triple D."}
{"text":"Flavorful dishes and Martini Mondays!  That makes me f-cking estatic!  The Thai waitress is not that friendly, but loved my Vietnamese friend and treated us well so I was happy."}
{"text":"OK, I didn't want to go here because the name sounded like \"wild thingy\", which sounds like bad porn movie.  Also, looked pretty sketch from the outside, but I have learned that is pretty common in Phoenix.  My Thai craving kicked in and I had to have some \"thingy.\"

It was packed inside for a weekday night, which is a good sign.  My tom yum soup and spicy basil chicken were right on the mark.  I think this would be a great carry out place and from all the sacks lined up, I guess everyone else likes to eat \"thingy\" too!"}
{"text":"I had a take-out order of tofu veggie pad thai. I have to say it's not right for me. Way too sweet. I understand that every Thai restaurant makes pad thai differently, but I think that it should still have at the very least a primary soy sauce taste with a hint of tamarind sour. I may come back to try something different."}
{"text":"The best Thai in the Phoenix...  This place could hang with the best in the country.  Highly recommend the salad rolls and boat."}
{"text":"This is a nice little place with a great atmosphere and a really welcoming interior.  Decorations are great.  As you're traveling North on Central, you have to pass the restaurant and then take a quick right-hand turn into their parking area.  If you park in the lot South of the location you'll get towed.

Food was fantastic.  It was really, really fantastic.  Everything was fresh and natural.  they have quite a few gluten-free items as well, which was great to see.  Spring rolls were delicious.  Gluten-free Chicken Pad Thai was top-notch.  Chicken curry was downright delicious.  Price was right, and we did not leave hungry!

Their service was what knocked them down to 4 stars.  Reading the other reviews, I have to agree with what has been said before.  Place was empty at 11:30 AM on a Saturday and the service was SLOW and kind of \"space case.\"  The young lady who served us looked like a manga cartoon, to include hair and makeup, and if that is fashionable, that is great (I guess) but she sort of pulled an attitude with the gent who was also working that day.  Not sure if he was a server, but he was certainly stepping in because she wasn't up to par.  When he mentioned a concern from another table, she got a little snotty with him in front of us and several other customers.

If we're in the area we'll certainly stop by again.  Food was delicious, and NOT HOT AT ALL, which was great for us.  I understand that if you really want them to \"bring the heat\" all you have to do is ask, but our super-sensitive stomachs were MORE than pleased with the \"base-level\" spice.  We'll make sure to attend during a slow time, however, because if the service was that slow with only a few people in attendance I can't imagine how it is when the place is packed."}
{"text":"Went there for Valentines day and got the Wild Boar. Good stuff! We were about 20 minutes late for our reservation, but they still took care of us hassle free even though they were busy. It's nice, clean and professional with great food at a nice price. Have not been disappointed after a sufficient number of visits."}
{"text":"Closes restaurant to one of my favorites in Las Vegas \"Archies Thai\" that I have been able to find in Phoenix.  Panga curry is top notch.."}
{"text":"Amazing everything. The crab wontons were  delicious. Everything was homemade and tasted great."}
{"text":"Definitely has some menu items that you can't get anywhere else. The atmosphere is a bit weird, but pretty solid Thai food. 

I would have given it 3 stars, but they have a beer called PHUKET. I laughed my a$$ off at that. 

\"Cry two tears in a bucket, Phuket\"!"}
{"text":"Tropical Fried Rice -- Amazing! They can substitute the chicken with Tofu which is perfect for us vegetarians, and the rice is just so addictive. You can't stop eating it. They don't overdo it or overcook the vegetables, and it's a perfectly balanced meal. I love everything about this place.

The owner, additionally, is very nice and very modest. You can barely tell that he runs one of the best thai places in downtown phoenix. Hands down, my favorite dinner option in central phx. You will come here and be impressed."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I accidentally found this place and it was the best accident ever! The Pad Thai and Chicken Curry was absolutely amazing and the Dragon eggs were delicious! Definitely Going back!"}
{"text":"We found this place through watching triple Ds. Since we were on a road trip and driving through Phoenix on 10/16/2017, we thought we would stop and try it. This was the best Thai food I've eaten so far. We brought some family with us and they loved the food also and said they would be back. The service was very good and very friendly and helpful. I wish this place was closer to where I live in Texas."}
{"text":"This place has been bookmarked for years and my friends and I met here for lunch today. I was excited to order one of their vegetarian lunch specials (of which there are 4). We arrived and were promptly seated and when our waitress asked for our drink choices, we also gave our orders (tofu veggie panang, beef panang, and tofu pad thai). It took about 20 minutes for our dishes to come out, since we arrived at noon and it was already busy. There were still a few empty tables and there is plenty of outdoor seating, which would be nice when the weather gets cooler. Everything looked great and it tasted even better. I loved my dish, the tofu panang. It was spicy enough and I liked the veggies and the sauce. The spring roll was tasty and it was a filling dish overall. 

Our waters were filled often and service was good. I would go back and try other items on their menu. I usually order pad thai whenever I visit a Thai restaurant and I'm so glad I tried something else this time because it was delicious."}
{"text":"Pad Thai here is the best. I usually did take out and the pad Thai still tasted good when I had it at home."}
{"text":"DDD Destination. 

Best Pad See Ew Ive had. It seems that they really pace seating so that the chef isn't overwhelmed."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place!   I rarely eat meat/picky with meat I eat  but the chicken here is always perfect! So delicious, friendly staff and great location!"}
{"text":"Super good Thai food !! Once you come here you'll never go to Pei Wei again ! Smells DELISH upon walking in , friendly service , clean modern atmosphere .. Decent prices , food is fresh and Taste amazing ! We had the Chicken pad Tai , Mu Yang (the guy Fieri item ) and a couple drinks , highly recommend the leeche martini. Can't wait to come back to try something new :)"}
{"text":"I love the restaurant's billboard out front - tiger eyes peering at you, an invitation to try cuisine from faraway lands. This is what brought my husband and myself in. The parking lot is rather small, we were lucky it wasn't too busy. I can imagine it would be difficult to find parking if it was a busy night. 

When you first enter, you have the option of dining inside (to your left) or outside on the covered patio (right). We decided to sit outside since it was such a lovely evening. I ordered an iced Thai coffee - which was delicious. For an appetizer, my husband ordered the Dragon Eggz - dumplings with pork. These came out promptly and were tasty. For dinner, I ordered the Ginger Fish - breaded salmon with mushrooms, pineapple, onions, etc in a ginger sauce. Big mistake. The salmon was more breading than fish and was swimming in the sauce - which I didn't particularly care for. It was a disappointment, but I'd like to come back and try something different since so many other Yelpers seem to enjoy this restaurant."}
{"text":"Really great Thai. The menu was diverse, creative, while also maintaining traditional plates. I very much enjoyed eating here and can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Mouthwatering food.

I have been here a few times, as it is walking distance from my office. 

The first time I ordered the vegetarian panang curry. Delicious and spicy. My only issue is I was sweating profusely on the walk back to the office. 

The last couple times I ordered the veggie pad thai. So scrumptious! They plate it beautifully. They use a good variety of fresh veggies... not just the standard broccoli and carrots. Lots of zucchini and cauliflower. Yum. The sauce has a lot of fresh garlic. It is so delectable. May be the best pad thai I have had in Phoenix.

Service is prompt and friendly. For lunch I am in and out under 40 minutes. They keep the fresh iced tea flowing...

I can't help but growl when co-workers ask me where I ate for lunch. \"Wild Thaiger... rowl!\""}
{"text":"The food was amazing,  got the hot pot with coconut sticky rice..omg. Dragon eggs were as delicious as promised and the fresh rolls were terrific."}
{"text":"The lunch menu is perfect. They are fast for a sit down restaurant and very helpful. I love the pad thai. My daughter loves that they make octopus hot dogs. I have never eaten here besides for lunch but I think it would be a good place to stop as well."}
{"text":"The food was honestly 4-star worthy, SO tasty. 

BUT because they accidently glutenated me, I'm going to give it a bummer three-stars. I asked the waitress if anything was gluten free and she said, \"the pad thai. all the people ask for it. it's safer\". I knew after the word \"safer\" I was in for a real treat. The pad thai was amazing, but then after feeling strange, I called back and asked probing questions about what was in it. I argued with the woman over fish paste, and she said the fish paste had wheat in it...and it was in the pad thai, yet the pad thai was gluten free? EEK. If you're a celiac, be careful and just go through the ingredients of what you want to order. 

The hot tea was amazing, and they offer the honey sugar packets - great! 

If you're not gluten-free - FOR SURE GO HERE FOR THAI! It's amazing. If you are, just be very very careful!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Thai food and I am proud to say I am now a believer!  Showed up at 8:30 on a Tuesday night, the hours said they closed at 9:00 so I was a little worried they wouldn't be very happy with us but we were greeted with a smile and taken to a table.  It took a little bit longer than normal for our waitress to come take our order but she was especially friendly so it wasn't too bad.  We ordered the Turtle Island Crab appetizer, I got the Beef Mangone (I didn't want something too crazy on my first adventure with Thai food!) and my friend ordered the Pad Cha Seafood.

The Turtle Island Crab was amazing!  My only issue with it is that I wanted more!  The wonton crackers were perfectly crispy, the crab and avocado blended together great and the dipping sauce that it came with was sweet with just a little kick.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it again!  My Beef Mangone was equally as impressive when it came out.  The presentation itself was beautiful and once I dug in, the flavor didn't disappoint either.  The beef was tender, the sauce had a bit of a kick but nothing crazy and the veggies were cooked perfectly and complemented the meat nicely.  I was nervous to try my friend's Pad Cha Seafood because it had been rated 3 peppers which equates to \"Thai Hot\" but I was glad I got the courage to do so because it was delicious too!  Everything was again cooked perfectly and the sauce was pretty hot but not unbearable.  I can't wait to go again and find something else to try!"}
{"text":"By far the best Chicken Pad Thai I've ever had. Very inexpensive compared to other places I've been when I've noticed this tends to be a more expensive city/area than even Austin. The spring rolls were average, but I'm more a fan of traditional Chinese style rolls."}
{"text":"My daughter and I enjoyed the Satay Sampler, Super Soup and Pad Thai noodles.  All delicious, great atmosphere, we were very satisfied."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. The prices are fair, (this is one of the fancier Thai restaurants I've been to) the thai tea is extra great, the people who work there are really friendly, so all around we're happy to go to this restaurant. The one star I knocked off is because sometimes you have to wait for your server to come around, but it's definitely not so bad you want to leave. They have a lot of customers which goes to show it's a good place to eat :)"}
{"text":"Food: 4.5 stars.  Service: 2.5 stars.  Excellent food, decor and presentation.  Seafood panang curry includes jumbo shrimp, oysters, scallops and squid; it does not come with enough rice though for the curry.  Mediocre service.  I really want to give this place 4-5 stars, but the long wait (even on a busy Saturday night) ruins the whole dining experience for hungry people.  We had to wait 45min for our seafood panang curry and pad thai while the table next to us that seated 10min after us got their appetizer, soup and main dish before us.  One waiter seemed to be doing everything from being in the kitchen to serving food to asking how things are and working the cash register (he was awesome!).  Hostess at the front door did not have any personality at all, and didn't say anything or come by throughout the night.  Another waiter only came by once to fill our water, and that was when we were almost done with our meal."}
{"text":"This place is great . Good food BUT SERVICE IS BAD.. Takes too long to get food and not enough staff to take care of customer. They need to hire a hostess and a busser to make things easier. Been there 3 times and food always great but service ALWAYS slow. And on the menu lunch are $7.95 but you are billed $9.95. Go figure. Any please fix it."}
{"text":"Really great taste and value for lunch special! I got the Yellow Curry Chicken with spring roll for $7.95. It was really yummy and not too hot. We sat on the patio on a very pleasant afternoon. Nice server."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this resturant after seeing it on Food Network....wait was about 30 minutes, dragon eggs were excellent. I've had better chicken pad thai, ribs were very tender and flavorful, the peanut chicken was nothing special. The staff was friendly and the chef was very personable, however, I wouldn't consider going back."}
{"text":"Started off with chicken spring rolls which were presently very well. They were light and crispy and came with a sweet sauce that paired excellently.

I ordered the Gia Katchu. It was a very tasty dish. The sweet sauce with onions and peppers made a good combo. However, the chicken had to be frozen and breaded somewhere else based on the look of them. I was disappointed about that. 

My girlfriend ordered the Holy Basil Chicken. It was a bit spicy for my taste, but she enjoyed it. The chicken was seasoned nicely and was topped with some items I did not recognize.

Overall, great presentation and pricing with this restaurant. We will visit again. Highly recommended for Thai food lovers."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and was pretty disappointed with the food. We went here because it was convenient but I wish we went to more places.

We got the Chicken Curry and Pad Thai. The curry was good but it was for the price, it wasn't worth it; I've had better. 

The Pad Thai was pretty bland. 

I am sure that there are other and better Thai places in Phoenix. I don't know for sure because I was on there for a few days, but I highly suggest going somewhere else."}
{"text":"LOVED this place! I had the beef Penang curry. It was spicy enough the regular way but you can adjust the heat as desired. I had to take home half because the portion was so large; a great deal for around $10! Our server was friendly and attentive and the atmosphere was cozy and clean. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I have loved this place since I first started coming here in 2008. Definitely the best Thai I have had in town and I will travel from the north valley for this  restaurant. Everyone I have taken here loves it. Pad Thai is delicious with chicken and shrimp. Curries are divine. Hubby loves their beef dishes. Soups are amazing. Love the corn fritters appetizer. Definitely a treat and different. Have not had a dish here that I did not like. Mango cheesecake is a must. Love this place. The outdoor seating is precious even though smack dab in central phx"}
{"text":"We have been here several times, and it has been fantastic every time.

The wait staff always remembers us, and is very friendly. The service is always great.

They keep the place clean as well, and that is a major plus.

The food has always been very, very good. Flavorful, and well priced.

I always order the Merry-Mu, which is a very good pork dish. I have also recently become a fan of the Fillet, as it is better than most steaks I have eaten that were three times the price at other places.

The Coconut sticky rice could be a meal all by itself, it is that good - and I am not a rice fan. Even the garnish/filler food is loaded with flavor.

The Mango Cheesecake is my favorite cheesecake desert of any place I have eaten, it is amazing.

I think this is one of the best places to eat in Phoenix, and it is worth the wait, the drive, and the money."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner. 

The sign says please wait to be seated.

So I waited, and waited, and waited some more. 

Employees walking by the hostess station. No greeting, or anything.

So I left and went to Thai Basil."}
{"text":"The food and service were quite good. I had never had white papaya before and could have sworn I was eating jicama and learned a new favorite fruit. They were generous to serve the ice separate from the ice coffee so I could add as little ice as I liked. 
I was disappointed that I couldn't sit on the outdoor patio since the heat index was 104°"}
{"text":"While Thaiger is my favorite lunch time Thai place. It's super close to my work. The lunch specials are well priced. I can call it in and take out. For the most part they are pretty consistent. From the outside you'd never guess that the inside was actually classy looking. Dimly lit with very dark furniture. Inside has an upscale feel though the outside looks pretty busted.

My two favorite lunch time orders are yellow chicken curry and pad Thai. Followed closely by the beef panang. And while I've had better, the convenience of this place can't be beat. The staff is always friendly on the phone and in person.

Cheers for Thai Fridays!"}
{"text":"Best chicken pad thai that I have ever eaten. I ordered it Thai hot and it came as hot as advertised, few places will make it that hot. The meal presents well, accompanied with shredded cabbage and beets."}
{"text":"Went to lunch at the Wild Thaiger yesterday after having no luck ordering to-go a couple weeks ago.  We sat outside on the covered patio, which was pretty busy.  Our server was prompt and pleasant.  

The food: I ordered chicken with peanut sauce and Jasmine rice.  The sauce was very flavorful, but no heat at all.  I'm used to peanut sauce with just a bit of heat and was mildly disappointed with this dish.  My friend ordered the Pad Thai and it was good, but again not much heat.  Now our server did not ask us about stars or heat at all.  If I were to go back I would order the Pad Thai with a side of peanut sauce and add more heat.

All in all, an affordable lunch, good service, and decent Thai food.  I would like to go back in the evening to check out the inside as I never set foot in it.  Maybe try another dish too.

Phoenix Yelpers- any other awesome Thai places to try??"}
{"text":"We saw a Guy Fieri endorsement on the door so we figured it was a safe bet. 

We both ordered the chicken Pad Thai with some spring roll appetizers.  Great tasting food. Very large portions. Only issue was was ordered medium spice based on the waitress suggestions and it could have been much hotter. Not really spicy at all. 

We sat inside, but they have a very large outdoor eating area as well. 

4 Bud for $9 was a great deal as well."}
{"text":"The service was great, our waitress was attentive, friendly and new the menu.
The food was everything Guy said it is.....awesome!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food I have ever had! I love how they made my pad Thai vegan! Very nice staff as well!! Will be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"3/5/10
My second attempt to dine here, as it was so busy the first time (and so noisy!), that I had to leave.  (It was during lunch hours, and I don't like to wait.)  Arrived a few minutes shy of the end of lunch, so I was able to dine in peace.  Ordered the tofu green curry and the fried banana and coconut ice cream for dessert.  I found the portion of the entree to be very skimpy for the price, and I've had much tastier, and creamier, curry sauce elsewhere (Tottie's, Thai Elephant, even Yupha's!).  Need I say more?  Seriously, WT's green curry tastes about the same as Thai Hut's, but at a portion that's about half (or less) of what I could get at TH, or any of the other places I've visited, but I suppose the \"atmosphere\" is what I'm paying for here?  That said, I must admit that the fried banana dessert was delicious!  Loved the toasted coconut on top (well, on top of the bananas, but under the syrup toppings, coconut ice cream, whipped topping, and maraschino cherry!).  On my next visit, when I'm craving for something sweet, I will ask to have the syrup toppings, whipped cream, and cherry omitted.  The dish is perfect w/out them."}
{"text":"This was my girlfriends first Thai experience and she has been won over!  I owe a bit of thanks to DDD for this as we do like to try the places we see not only on that show, but others.  

We started with what DDD raved about; the Dragon's Egg's were out of the park outstanding!  Just perfect with the slice of jalapeno.  The waitress was spot on with her suggestions and the Peanut Passion was a good place to start for my girlfriend.  I sampled her dish and the peanut sauce was exactly what I expected, not too salty and a bit sweet.  The carrots were a bit off, however.  I had the Phuket Fantasea.  You could season with spice to your own palate which, I was courteous and let my girlfriend have a go before I spiced it up.  

The wait was a bit long, but reading some of the other comments, it's to be expected.  Not to mention, they were fairly busy for a Sunday evening!  All in all, outstanding and next spring training, we will no doubt be making a return!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me here for Valentine's day dinner and I honestly feel in love! The curry was perfect not too spicy."}
{"text":"Although I was aware of the ratings beforehand, this place was recommended by staff members at the hotel we were staying at-- as well as Triple D. So what the heck, we gave it a shot.

There was two other parties in the restaurant when we arrived for lunch on a Saturday, and by the time we ordered another 4 parties had arrived.

Right off the bat our waitress seemed impatient and not very friendly, which isn't a good start to anyone's experience. I didn't see anyone else on the floor so she must've been the only one waiting on the tables.

We started off with some veggie and chicken rolls-- which were nothing memorable. My dish was the pad Thai which again, nothing that id recommend or come back for. It lacked in flavor, and had some sort of dry pepper flakes on it which I've never had before whenever ordering this familiar dish. 

The other two dishes that were ordered at my table were decent in flavor but nothing special. 

At least the ice tea was pleasant!

I've come to assume the hype is all from Triple D, otherwise... I just don't get it?"}
{"text":"What a great little Thai place in Central Phoenix. Great lunch specials Mon-Fri. (Not as great on the weekends.) I like that that Pad Thai comes with chicken, tofu and shrimp all in one dish for one price. I prefer a bit spicier, maybe I should have asked for that. The plate was piled high with noodles, green onions, peeled beets and carrots. I took a book, sat by myself and had a great afternoon. 

Prompt, friendly service. They kept my water full, that's all I require to leave a great tip. 

Lots of choices on the menu, lots of drink specials. Parking in the back, or take the light rail. This is a great place."}
{"text":"Awful experience. Arrive at 11:55 today. Seated at 12:00. 15 minutes later we had to get up and ask for a drink and for someone to take the order. We never saw a server again. At least not at our table. The people next to us got decent service. It seemed like the new their server. We finally had to leave. When we told the hostess on the way out. It was just, \"ok\" like that was a normal occur again. Never again."}
{"text":"Tried Wild Thaiger last night. Great spot , had to try it after watching Diners, Drive ins & Dives. Didn't realize where it was & the location is so accessible & right next to Durants.  Started off with the DDD recommended dragon eggs . We tried them half crispy half steamed ... delicious! WE then had the Phad Thai to split and we both liked it . I would describe the ambiance as eclectic & fun . There was a very large office gathering so, the noise level was a little louder due to that, but we will be back. Cute little date spot."}
{"text":"Probably the best chicken pad thai I've ever had. I love thai food! But this is the first place I've experienced the pad thai spicy...and might I say, it is amazing! The house salad was pretty good for a salad. The mango with sticky rice hit the spot...and fulfilled my dessert craving. If I'm ever in town again, I'm definitely coming back here!!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome and the decor is great.  I've eaten here a few times and never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I just finished eating at this place I came because off that show, the triple D. Mind you the food was amazing but the service sucks!!!!!!! I think because of the show she is getting more business than usually, my opinion she needs to hire more staff! I came from California just to try her food and I was skipped twice to be seated and then 3 times to be waited on! I had to ask to be waited on! Not ok!"}
{"text":"Went out here for a friend's birthday party the other week.  They were wonderful in accommodating the large party of 20 people that we had even though they don't have the largest of space.  The food was wonderful.  Typically, not too spicy for those with heat-wary tongues, but for the true spice nuts, they have dishes that will make your eyes water. The Dragon Eggs and Vegetable and Spring rolls were amazing.  For an entree, I highly recommend the Tropical Fried Rice, Kimow, and Phuket Fantasea.  Service can be slow at times, but the wait is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, but we were a bit neglected on a slow Saturday night with the service. It might have been no dedicated hostess to greet and more of the attention was on waiting tables outside. There were only three couples inside including us. The food took awhile to come out and wife had sand in her broccoli for her entree. I would come back probably for a lunch instead of dinner to give it another chance."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Great food, sometimes very busy at odd hours(right near closing!) but worth the wait."}
{"text":"I was stuck in Phoenix for the night and needed to find some dinner.  I walked down the street from hotel room and headed towards a highly rated steakhouse.  But, when I saw the prices and weighed my hunger - I thought better about it.  Next door, I found Wild Thaiger which was also highly rated and seemed like a better choice.  I was right!!  I sat down at the bar and was quickly helped by the friendly waitress.  I flipped through the menu and saw all the usual Thai fare - but one specialty stuck out to me...  a spicy wild boar dish.  I was in and the waitress double checked to be sure I was aware about the spiciness of the dish.  Armed with a beer and water, I dove in for a fantastic feast.  I didn't notice the sliced thai chilies that adorned the dish until I really dug in.  Phew!!  It was spicy and it was delicious!!!  The wild boar appeared and tasted like tender slices of pork.  The sauce was flavorful and the chilies gave it a great kick.  The Thai girls in the kitchen were pleasantly surprised to see me finish the plate without suffering too much.  In fact, I LOVED it.  

I don't really spend much time in Phoenix, but I will revisit Wild Thaiger if I am near by."}
{"text":"Always the best service good....don't miss mango cheese cake favorite pad cha seafood...."}
{"text":"Im not sure why this place was featured on Diners, Dives and Drive-ins. Its not that great.  The chicken pad thai is pretty decent, but I have had better.  My second trip here was not great at all.  Came in and it wasn't crammed packed like the first time, so that was nice but the service was horrible.  My friend and I sat and waited as we watched the tables clear out one by one and no food came out.  I had to flag the waitress down twice before she would even respond as to why we had been waiting for 1/2 hour at this point for our food. It was a piss poor excuse and they weren't that apologetic.  We finally got our food  45 minutes into my hour lunch and it wasn't as good as the first time.  Pad thai was barely warm enough to eat.  If you want chili paste brought to your table.... an additional .50 cents.  WTF?  There prices are high enough to compensate the making of chili paste dry or wet.  I don't know if I will come back here.  I would rather drive down the road a few miles and go somewhere else.  Sadly."}
{"text":"Great food.  Poor service.  Waitress was rude and avoided my inquire of service. I had to wait 20 minutes to get food."}
{"text":"I am so glad I didn't let the 3.5 stars keep us from coming to Wild Thaiger for dinner. I have never had Thai before and I loved it! We got the hot pot soup first to share because it looked interesting, and oh my goodness it was fantastic. I couldn't get enough. The coconut mixed with the lemon, basil, parsley, spice... YUM! We also got gluten free pad Thai and Mi Dang. Both were amazing. The service was also exceptional. All the servers were so nice and helpful.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My second visit, first on an incredibly busy New Years Day dinner service, and I must say that was a much better experience than this lunch. It was not very busy and the best attention we received was from the sweet beverage server. I attempted to order from her and she needed to get our server, wish we could have kept the first one. Alex seemed put off by us and hardly wanted to engage our questions about the menu after putting in our starter. Took an additional fifteen minutes or more before we requested her return so we could place or entree order. Starter: Dragon eggs, 6 fried dumplings filed with pork and crab, $10, I was so hungry at this point and they were a nice start. They did taste like chicken meat balls though with a sweet hoison. I ordered beef panang and was surprise that there were absolutely no vegetables in my dish, I order curries often. The portion was large and I'll dress up the rest with veggies at home but I will now be returning to Wild Thaiger. The beverage server should move to a nicer place that will recognize her genuine nature and potential talents."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great Thai food and has been one of my favorite spots in Phoenix for years!"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Wild Thaiger.  It's location is great, right off the light rail on Central in Midtown.  On my quests for eating in some of my favorite places before I leave Phoenix, I met a good friend for dinner here last night. The food was wonderful as always, but one think last night stuck out.  When we arrived, we waited at the hostess station for probable 3 minutes before we were greeted.  Very odd.  Then when we were seated, another 4 minutes later before someone came over to take our drink order. A person who wasn't even our server.  Now when our server did come over, he was very attentive for the rest of the evening and the service was excellent. 

We started with the Freshie Rolls. YUM.  These fresh \"Vietnamese type\" rolls were so yummy and for sure stand up to their name \"fresh\".   They came with a wonderful spicy peanut sauce.  I had the Pad Thai.  Thin rice noodles prepared with chicken, shrimp, and tofu topped with fresh sprouts, and crushed peanuts.  As always it was delicious and plentiful.
If you're in the area and want great Thai, give them a try."}
{"text":"Food has gotten so much better. the vegetarian 24K rocks my world with Thai pumpkin, eggplant, veggies in spicy green curry. get it hot!!! delicious. service is fast and friendly too."}
{"text":"Good was great. A little busy but was seated quickly. Def a good place to stop for a date."}
{"text":"Always happy with the food and service. The only HIV infected rodent I saw was the couple who complained about everything.  Im sure we have all sat next to them before!  Nice restaurant, happy its in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"The food was okay. I felt like the dishes we had didn't have enough flavor. Tastes kind of bland. Thai food should be strong with flavor and I didn't get that. However the customer service was great."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now and everything I've had has been fantastic as well as the service. The dragon eggz and the crab wontons are two of my favorite appetizers anywhere. The fried banana with coconut ice cream is friggin yummy. Still workin my way through the entrees but I haven't had a bad one yet!!!"}
{"text":"Food is very tasty but the main drawback is, they take so much time to get our order ready. We almost waited like 30 mins to get our food served but apart from that, worth the money you pay. Its a bit expensive but its fine. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"It was my first time experience here. I ordered chai tea and it was great. Then I ordered tom yam goong. The flavor of fish sauce was quite strong. I tasted salty overcome the tamarind. 
I ordered curry and that one the decent one for my taste. Little bit spicy which is I like. The decor was nice, I felt comfortable. The service was fast and great waiter. There is a board sign for cellphone user ..lol...
They have Indonesian coffee which I should try next time. 
The private parking lot was in the back of the building.
I might go back to try something else next time."}
{"text":"I actually like this place. I find the mood to be nice and the lighting just right. The food is well prepared and the alcoholic drinks are fantastic. Martinis! My one complaint....they need to add some more vegetarian dishes.  I find myself ordering this great appetizer every time I go there because it's the only thing with tofu on it. Anyways, it's a great place for a date :)"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food at this restaurant. Our disappointment is in how the wait staff was directed to assist the customer. It seems that the wait staff have a variety of jobs other than taking care of the patron. This caused our food to be delayed. It also caused our bill to be delayed. We never were quite sure who our waitress was. It is some of the best Thai food we've had but the service is disappointing."}
{"text":"Pretty good thai food. I have been here twice and enjoyed the curry dishes very much. Great quality food and perfectly prepared. Service is always prompt and friendly - great place for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Great Thai food!  The grapao gai is my favorite, the green curry is great too, as well as the soups. The downsides are that there is usually a wait to be seated and the service is a little slow (for lunch)."}
{"text":"Sat outside on a midweek evening.  Very nice atmosphere and outdoor space even though it's on the road, it's done well.  Only two or three occupied tables, but attentive service.  Very good bar drinks.

Food was ok, but perhaps New York City Thai food has us spoiled.  We ordered Dragon Eggz dumplings, not outstanding.  Pad See Ew and Peanut Passion was fine, not extraordinary.

I would try other area restaurants before returning here, but would not be opposed to returning especially for the service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends. Food is decent, except one of my friends got a soup that didn't taste right (might have given her the wrong order?). Although I'd like to give this place another shot, the service will definitely be keeping me away. It wasn't busy at all, but our server was not very attentive. Maybe if I'm desperate for Thai when I'm downtown, I'll give it another shot."}
{"text":"I've been there about 5 times and all those times have been horrible. I shouldn't have to wait about 5 minutes to get their attention on a drink to go. All I wanted was a Thai tea. When I actually sat down and ate, the service took awhile before they got to me too. Food was good, but I've had better. This place needs to either hire more people or organize themselves better."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place (except the location because it's too far from me). I've eaten at many Thai restaurants but Im yet to find one that is better than Wild Thaiger. The food is fabulous, packed with flavor and a very hearty portion."}
{"text":"Almost every time I have come in this place, they have been so busy. Their food speaks for itself. Having to eat gluten free their pad Thai and gf chicken curry, I am never sick after eating here and always am full. They have perfect sharing portions for much of their foods and I hope you'll give them a shot. I will be back and may see you there sometime!"}
{"text":"Well...mixed bag!

Went with a buddy on a Wednesday night and the place seemed to be hopping...maybe a bit too busy as the service was pretty bad.  We were seated right away, but waited 15 minutes for a waiter.  Appetizer arrived fairly promptly, but there was nearly a 30 minute wait after the appetizer was cleared for main courses to arrive.  

We had the Vegie Sampler as an appetizer and it was incredibly delicious - I'd go back just to order that dish!  Crispy/crunchy corn fritters, big chunks of seared tofu (which sounds sort of nasty to a meat-eater like me but was incredible!) with peanut sauce, and crispy fried vegie rolls.  This dish was the only real winner - and was way over the top with flavor!

My buddy had a tofu/vegie dish - I wish I knew what it was exactly - but on the menu it had a single pepper on it.  He ate half of it and was beading with sweat, so beware that even a \"medium heat\" dish can get pretty hot.  I asked for a vegie/chicken dish - something \"healthy\" and was told about a dish with a soy and garlic sauce.  The chicken and vegies were fairly good (a bit heavy on the cauliflower maybe) but the sauce just tasted \"off\" - not like soy/garlic at all and was odd enough that I didn't finish the dish either.  It wasn't flavorful - it didn't taste like I'd had it described - and it didn't compliment the rest of the dish.   Both of our issues with main courses are probably more personal preferences but there's also room for improvement maybe in how the dishes were described to us.

I had a ginger martini and my buddy had a very tall mai tai ($6 - which was a good deal for the large glas!).

So...hit and miss...but I will try it again."}
{"text":"I recently discovered that I am gluten intolerant. What distressed me most was the thought of not having savory, delicious Thai food again. After a quick Yelp search I found Wild Thaiger who has a decent vegetarian and gluten free menu. 

I ordered the yellow curry with tofu, veggies and brown rice. OMG!!!! It was sooooo good. It cost extra to substitute white rice with brown. Not sure why it's an extra cost but whatever. I ordered it from the list of lunch specials. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because their lack of vegetarian soup options. The lunch specials include soup and egg roll. Well, there should be a non meat based soup for your vegan and vegetarian customers. That being said, I will most certainly return and get the exact same meal!!"}
{"text":"The Wild Thaiger is the best kept Thai restaurant secret on North Central Avenue.  My first culinary experience at Thaiger was several months ago with co-workers. My omnipresent dinner companion Marcial and I, have been habitual customers since.

Office employees flock to Wild Thaiger during the week for lunch and bring a few close friends or relatives back at night or on the weekend to share their secret.  The restaurant atmosphere is very friendly and unpretentious.  

The food is where the adventure begins. For a flaming start, Tom Yum Goong is a must of any visit to Wild Thaiger.  The soup is a concert of spicy hot lemony flavors that leave you wanting more.  Don't fret, you can always order more to go.
Dragon's Eggs are paramount on our list of favorite's starters These Dumplings are stuffed with pork and crab, wrapped in tender wrapping, nestled in fresh vegetables and comes with a seasoned dipping sauce. 

The Lunch and dinner menu is delectable and you will want to try a new dish on each visit.

Order hint: Each plate is made to your specification.  If you want \"more curry\", \"spicier\" or \"hotter\" you only need to ask. 

Desert Hint: The Coconut Ice Cream is made onsite: It is delicious and contagious.

Drink hints: A nice compliment to the food is a glass of Chardonnay or you can try the sweet Thai Iced Tea. 

It is very common for the Olashawn (owner and head chief) to leave the open kitchen to seat, greet, and serve her guests.  She is the heart of The Wild Thaiger.  As Marcial and I leave and thank her for another wonderful meal, her gracious smile, hands clasps and graceful bow, keeps us coming back.

Note:  METRO Lightrail construction has impacted this restaurant and you need to follow construction signs carefully to navigate the street and driveway to Wild Thaiger.  Drive slow, this Tiger is worth hunting in the concrete jungle."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is good. Food is alright. Staff could be more attentive. Prices are a bit high."}
{"text":"Pretty nice setting, nice waitresses, *really* good food, and the price is right. I easily could have expected lunch to cost twice as much; $8 for a Chicken Curry plate for lunch, I'm sold."}
{"text":"As Thai food goes it was solid. I took my family for a night out service was quick the food was good. I was a little bummed that they ran out of ribs. But the Beef Panang I had was on point. I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Called in another order earlier this week. It was ready when I got there. As always, the food was amazing. I'm still trying to figure out how they have beef of such incredible quality. They cook it perfectly. Just awesome. One nitpick- dinner costs more than lunch but you don't get a spring roll with it? Come onnnnn! Just throw one in the bag. I won't tell!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with a friend. Decent sized patio. Ate inside. Decor was nice. 

Tom Yum soup was ok. 2.5/5. Didn't have the depth of flavor that I was hoping for. 

Tofu Panang, on the other hand, was fantastic. 5/5. Bold and well-balanced flavors. Great heat to it. 

Service wasn't friendly. She seemed rushed and bothered. But she was very efficient, so that was cool at least."}
{"text":"This is my go to place near work for some Pad Thai.  I am a huge fan of their Veggie Pad Thai or their Pad Thai in general.  Always a fan when craving Thai.  Their Thai Ice Tea is also delish!"}
{"text":"I've been on a big-time Thai curry kick lately. For the past couple months, I've gone on a food crusade to find the best curry in Phoenix. The big winner (drum roll...): Wild Thaiger. I had the yellow curry with vegetables and tofu from the lunch menu. The tofu and vegetables were perfectly cooked and the curry base was full of flavor. It says a lot that Wild Thaiger was one of the first Thai places I tried during my journey, and it managed to stay at the top of my list throughout. Next time you're in the central Phoenix area and in need of a curry fix, give this place a try."}
{"text":"I LalaLOVE this place!! I've been on this crazy Thai kick for a long while now and after trying so many places that were decent but not too amazing, I found this place! THIS IS MY THAI SPOT now! 

My friend and I decided to go here for lunch and it was pretty busy. But we were seated quickly and ready to order. We got the spring rolls (1 came with the lunch menu item) which were so delicious and crispy. For our entrees, we got the pad thai and the red curry. Both dishes were amazing. But the pad thai was our favorite, which is a big deal to us since I don't really like pad thai that much. The curry was a little spicy but it was so creamy and flavorful. The veggies were perfectly cooked and the tofu wasn't soggy. The pad thai was loaded with veggies and again the tofu was not soggy. It was such a great dish. 

Service was good. Our waitress was sweet and prompt. 
The food is inexpensive for the quality.

We can't wait to come back. 

Oh and I love the name of this place. \"The wild THAIger.\" Rawr! So clever."}
{"text":"Food was good but soup wasn't hot.  Service was incredibly slow even though no one was in the restaurant but a couple other two tops.  I'd come back but try a different server next time."}
{"text":"I came here on a yelp review for the area and really didn't know what to expect since a lot of people mentioned long waits.  I came on a Sunday at 3 pm and had the whole place to myself. Sat inside waitress's super nice and gave me some food tips I ended up ordering yellow curry chicken and thai iced tea I missed the lunch menu ended at 2 but all in all food was good curry was a little thicker than usual but meat was tender and veggies perfect. Entree was around $10 and tea $3 I also ordered basil chicken as suggested for my lunch tomorrow (beats airplane food) I walked from downtown Phoenix close to ASU about 2 mile walk but yes I would come again when in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Sweet and sour soup was yummy. But the pad Thai was disgusting. The curry did not have enough sauce."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food! A must-visit place form those who love Asian food. Food is superb. Service is excellent, and the prices are VERY reasonable. Hope they open more locations in the valley!"}
{"text":"We were craving Thai food and we saw that this place was on Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives so we were excited to give it a try. It was a busy Thursday night dinner and the floor was extremely understaffed -- the hostesses were cleaning/rearranging tables and delivering check to customers in between seating people. Granted, the place is small, but there were only two other actual servers taking orders and running the entire floor. This was just the beginning of a sadly disappointing night here.

We ordered the fresh rolls for an appetizer, chicken pad Thai and the Thaiger Ribs with Thai tea. The fresh rolls came out quickly and while I thought it was a generous serving size for an appetizer and for the price, the fresh rolls were bland. The side sauce that came with it was overdone and was outside the traditional peanut sauce that usually comes with it. The rest of our food came 25 mins after our appetizer came out, which we thought was a little long but we waited patiently anyway. This pad Thai was very much forgettable -- in fact, it lacked flavor. It came in a huge, beautifully presented plate but there was nothing more to it. The Thaiger ribs were overdone to the point that the meat was tough and hard to chew. Again, the side sauce that came with it was unfitting and did not complement the BBQ sauce of the ribs.

We didn't finish our meals and were very disappointed. We had to get the staff's attention so we could get our checks and leave, which still added another 10-15 mins. The only reason I'm not giving this place a one star is because the few staff that we encountered on the floor were great even if they were under extreme stress. I probably would not come back here again."}
{"text":"We started with the jasmine iced tea.  Very refreshing and I didn't even add sugar to it.  A couple starters. Lab Gal and Dragon Eggz. The Eggz were amazing. Keep in mind all the food brought to our table was presented as you would see in magazines. Works of art on plates. I ordered a Papua salad. Whoooweee spicey just like I like it. I had the chicken and yellow curry. Gawd it was sooo good. My fiancé opted for the wild boar dish. BC we were pretty sure they were true to the 3 pepper heat index he asked if they'd do a not so spicey version. he was thrilled with his plate. He said my 1 pepper index salad was spicier.... Portions are large and I felt that prices were more than fair. Seating on the inside is limited and very classy. We showed up around 630ish on Friday (night before Valentine's Day) and the place quickly filled up after that. Outside seating looked like a lot of fun and they have heaters out there too. If given a choice, I would have chosen out there. Although not a black tie place, people were dressed from way below casual to dresses. Service took a little bit, but very well worth the wait. The staff were very nice and informative. When we come back next year, we will be having dinner here again."}
{"text":"I just experienced the best Pad Thai of my life! The Wild Thaiger has a relaxed atmosphere, is a great place to go out with friends, and the prices are awesome!"}
{"text":"Great food and generally good service. Lunch time can turn into a loong wait, but it's always worth it. Green Curry, mmmmmmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"Good Thai food is hard to find.

You've found it here!

I went here for lunch today and was blown away. I feel like I've been to so many places around the valley and just haven't found one that I like. I found this place on a whim and decided to try it out. I'm vegan so it's hard for me to find places where I can eat anything. This place had multiple options and everything I tasted was good. I had the Tofu Veggie Pansang. It was delightfully spicy and the tofu was cooked perfectly. My friend had the pad thai and was equally as impressed.

They had good lunch specials and delicious Iced Tea.

I will be going back here again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here. The Ribs were amazing, they fell right off the bone and the sauce was very flavorful! Everyone in our party enjoyed their food! Great experience."}
{"text":"When it comes to Thai food I have definitely had my share of experiences. The only experience I have yet to experience is actually eating in Thailand. I've had Thai food around many places in the U.S. Such San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Chicago. I also had Thai in China. 

That being said eating here tonight has By far reached and exceeds beyond my expectation. I was joined with my friend who is Laos. Laos being neighbors of Thailand, the food is just about the same with of slight differences. After a 20min wait on First Friday, we waited another 15-20 mins per each dish. We ordered 3. The first dish was spring rolls. Let me tell you I have had my share of spring rolls with peanut sauce. I thought I would experience just any other experience I've had, which is average. I mean it's spring rolls. The first bite with the peanut sauce was the most delicious bite I have ever had. I could of just ordered spring rolls and I would of been more than satisfied. My friend mentioned that the sauce was authentic sauce it was not your typical restaurant sauce. My friend felt like a she tasted a piece of home."}
{"text":"We found our local Thai! Have only picked up orders to go, but the food is delicious and the service is great. The restaurant is really cute with a great outdoor area."}
{"text":"I order take out from here fairly regularly, they're always prompt and delicious. The coconut curry and the pad see ewe are awesome. I'm not sure if they have lunch specials so it can be a bit more expensive for a quick lunch but the quality is evident and totally worth the extra two or three dollars you spend instead of going somewhere not nearly as good. You can tell their meats are quality and not just hidden under a load of spices. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad, just wish their thai hot was actually hot. Excuse the criticism but this thai restaurant is definitely watered down in terms of authenticity."}
{"text":"I had the yellow curry chicken for lunch.  Excellent curry flavor, just the right size for a mildly spiced lunch.  The dish is curry with chicken and potatoes in the broth and large helping of rice in the middle.  I would definitely order the dish again."}
{"text":"Holy grail of Thai food in Phoenix. Guy Fieri approved. Get ready to take a ride to Flavortown.

They are a little on the slow side but it's nothing to lessen the 5 star rating or prevent me from ever coming back. The waiters are always extremely nice which makes up for it too. 

I always get the yellow curry with tofu and veggies and it's just to die for. It's creamy, rich, and plated beautifully. We always order 2 of the Satay Sampler, one with the works and one with only chicken. I personally think the works is the best way to go. The chicken, beef, and shrimp all pair perfectly with the peanut sauce, I can't even decide which meat is best. We also ordered a Tom Ka Gai to share and it was A+++. Lastly, we ordered a Milk Tea. I'm a sucker for boba and their boba was good. Good not great. The milk tea tasted like cereal milk, which was strange, but not unappetizing."}
{"text":"Of course I had to try this Gem in downtown Phoenix because it was on triple DDD. Let's just say I will be back for the dragon eggs they were so good!!!! The Padtai was some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Best Thai Restaurant in AZ.  And I include in that statement the entire experience.  Great food, nice unique wine list, interesting cocktails.  Panang and Urban Riesling done and done."}
{"text":"So, this place was my absolute favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix until today. The service was pretty slow for only having me, my friend, and another costumer in the restaurant. The food was cold when is was brought out to us -with no radishes like they usually put on them, and those make the dish!- My friend ordered medium hot, and she got no spice. She didn't even eat it! Plus the spring roll I ordered wasn't the usual one they serve, it was small and gross AND my friend didn't even get the sticky rice she ordered, the waitress still tried to charge us for it. Needless to say, they have let me down :("}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. The berry green tea is excellent and their lunch specials are very reasonable. I had something with eggplant and beef in it and my wife had the ginger chicken. Fast service and great prices for the quality of food you get!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for awhile ever since I saw it on diner,drive in and dives.. they have couple of ur usual menu items u will find in any other Thai restaurants like pad Thai, different types of curry and etc.. my friend and I ordered the \"dragon eggs\" which are dumplings u can either have it steamed or crispy or half and half.. and the chicken egg rolls .. then I ordered the spicy boat dish which was pretty good.. never seen it anywhere else and my friend ordered a chicken dish.. we both enjoyed our meals.. this place is small, I suggest coming early before any lunch or dinner rush because it does get crowded pretty fast.. they have their own private parking lot in the back.."}
{"text":"Bland and uninspired. The girls don't know the menu items and ingredients. I've lived in Thailand and street food there is better."}
{"text":"Good food and service. If the food is listed as spicy it is. Papaya salad was excellent as was the jasmine tea. Service was perfect."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place in a fun area of town.  Unfortunately, the service was slow and the food was low quality for the price.  Fish was overcooked and dumplings mediocre.  Not a place I would go back to since there are so many good options out there."}
{"text":"One night we decided to look for a good thai restaurant in CenPho, and upon some searching and previous good reviews, we chose to try the Wild Thaiger. We started the meal off with the corn fritters. They were crispy and delicious and had a yummy cucumber chutney with them. For my entree, I had the Tofu Mangone and it was awesome. I love spice, and not just a little, I like a lot, and my dish certainly turned up the heat. We finished the meal with the blueberry kaffir lime cheesecake. It was creamy, cool, and a wonderful way to end a meal. I'm so happy to have found a good thai place!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth a visit.  Good food and good service.  The dumpling and corn fritter apppetizers were fantastic.  As well as the fried rice.  I've had better pad thai before but it was still good!"}
{"text":"My sister and I met here for a pre-game dinner before the Diamondbacks game.  I arrived before she did, so I sat in one of the couches on the patio.  I was approached a couple of times by waitresses during this time, but told them I was just waiting for someone.  When my sister arrived, we went to the hostess stand to request a table.  There was one couple ahead of us, then two or three other couples arrived and crowded the hostess stand as we waited for someone... ANYONE... to seat us.  There is a tall room divider that separates the hostess area from the service area/bar/kitchen, so nobody knew we were there.  This should probably be addressed to avoid a crowd in an already small waiting area.  Once we were seated, our waitress took great care of us, and was happy to suggest drinks and food items.  We ordered the Dragon Eggz (prepared both steamed and fried), the Satay Sampler, and the Lahb Gai.  We loved the first two items, but the third wasn't exactly our piece of cake, although it was prepared nicely.  Using cabbage in the capacity of a lettuce roll was a little awkward.  All in all, we were both very pleased with our meal.  Had we not already been full (and in a rush) we would have ordered the coconut ice cream, which other Yelpers seem to sing the praises of.  I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Busy at lunch, but this place is awesome.  Great selection but could do better on the service and speed during lunch hour. 

Dragon Eggs for appetizer was good. 
I had the catfish with a 1 pepper spice level and it was awesome.
Sister said it was the best fried rice she's had in a long time. 

Check it out but go on off hours."}
{"text":"The food was ok, service slow even though it wasn't crowded when we first got there - it did however get very busy 30 mins after, around noon.
The only thing I really liked about this place was the unsweetened iced green tea. 
I got the chicken pad Thai which was ok - decent price at $8.95 but if you want a spring roll it's another $1.50, and soup another $1.50. The soup of the day was egg drop soup and it was really gross - bad after taste like dirt, so didn't end up eating it. 
I know it's a lunch rush but the wait staff wasn't attentive and took the food so long to come out, especially comparing it to other Thai places in the area. 
I doubt I'll come back."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, good service but food was okay.

I'm not a huge Thai fan and am not an expert by any stretch. I have a few favorites and prefer flavor over spice/heat. The two dishes I had at Wild Thaiger were lacking in flavor. They had awesome aromas, but fell flat on the palate. The chicken in both dishes was rubbery and overcooked.

However, this was a cute restaurant and the service was good. The patio was nice."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here. I came for a celebratory dinner. The service was very poor, our food came out in different order. It was over priced and came out cold for the amount food you get."}
{"text":"The Wild Thaiger is one of my new favorite places.  Every dish I've tried as been excellent.  They accomodated with some grace a friend with food allergies and were polite -- too polite -- in serving me as I (unknowingly) arrived just at closing.  The peanut sauce on the satay is amazing.  Pad Thai is a standby at a Thai place, but it definitely does not disappoint here.  The beef curry was excellent.  The ginger fish dish less remarkable but still good.  Coconut ice cream dessert is good for putting out the fire.  Good place to go after an Art or Heard museum visit."}
{"text":"Delicious. Came here for lunch instead of going to our usual Thai Basil. The only complaint I have is that the food took forever. I went around 11 am with my coworker and it seemed like another family that came in 15 minutes after us got their food before we did. The food was good, but I wish the egg roll wasn't extra."}
{"text":"Usually when my friends go on and on about how they love a restaurant, I can't wait to get in and try the food. Our tastes are often a match. 

The first concern I had from the beginning was the fact that there was only one person of Thai descent working and she was slinging the stuff they were selling. 

We open the menu to find reasonably priced fare (a soft spot for my wallet). Many of the dishes you would be accustomed to finding in any Thai restaurant could also be found on the menu here. Since it was my first visit to this establishment, I decided to go safe and ordered the Pad See Iew with Chicken. Once it arrived, I was pleased with the presentation. But in my many years of eating I have learned, just because it look good fo show don't mean it goin' da taste good!! To be fair it wasn't horrible... but I certainly have had better. 

The waitress could have been quite a bit more attentive. Something just seemed a little off about her? I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was that was off... but if I do, I'll let you know. Perhaps one thing could have been the fact that a table of 8 came into her section about 15 minutes after we arrived and we seemed to have been just forgotten. 

To sum it up folks... if you are in the area and you want a REAL Thai dish with plenty of kick hit up Thai Hut on McDowell and 1st St. Amazing food served by the people that invented the stuff, and prompt extremely attentive service."}
{"text":"Great food , i ordered To go and was told 20 min , waited about 25 . Food was GREAT!! Nice restaurant , set up was nice . I definitely will be coming back to eat here!!"}
{"text":"We went back here this past Saturday night with a friend from out of town and liked it just as much as we did when we tried it a few months ago. My Cosmopolitan was just as big and tasty as it was last time, and the service was still attentive and friendly. My friend is a pescetarian/flexitarian (doesn't eat meat except for fish), and we were really pleased to find that all of the dishes we ordered that we usually get with meat were still absolutely delicious. Specifically, the Pad See Ew (which we usually get with chicken or beef) was still savory with just the fried tofu and perhaps even more amazing, the Mussaman curry (which usually comes with a deliciously braised beef) was still really flavorful and was complimented nicely by the tofu. Even after trying a decent number of other Thai places in Phoenix, we like Wild Thaiger for the full bar, consistently good flavors, great service, and fun atmosphere, and we will definitely continue to come here often."}
{"text":"We went in just before the lunch rush. We sat down and our drink orders were taken. It took another 15 minutes for our food order to be taken. I will say that in that 15 minutes the lunch rush came in, so we understood. However, there was not apology or acknowledgment of our extended wait. We saw several of the parties that came in after us served before we received our food. About 25 minutes after our order was taken we received our food. Just as we saw two parties who came in after us headed out the door.  We were finally asked how the food was by an employee (not our waitress) and after telling him about our experience. We were told the full kitchen staff was working, but the wait staff was short. He said he did not know why it took so long for us to be served.  Our main problem was the lack  of apology or acknowledgment.  I really wish I had a pen so I could tell them that the two dollar tip that was left was not an indicator of how cheap I was, but how bad the service was. 

As for the food, i was good, but not amazing. It definitely was not good enough for me to forgive the faults and try this place again."}
{"text":"Worse service i ever had, got a hangover between drinks because it took so long, food was ok, but they have to get yheir shit together or they'll be gone!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service was so rude. I work in the industry so I have never written a bad review before. I tried to call in a Togo order and apparently when busy they do not tend to the phone ... ok I get dine in customers should be a priority. However if I make the effort to drive down to place an order I should be at least get acknowledge. I placed a Togo order and then sat down to wait... I was never offered a drink and when I asked if I could get a cocktail while I wanted I was ignored by the first waitress. The second asked if I need a menu for a drink... I said no I know what I would like ... she walk off.  Then the hostess came over and asked if I wanted a drink... we r going on 10 minutes now... I said I would have love to have a drink but now I'm sure my food will be ready any minute.. hostess was apologetic.. however when I tried to ask for a manager apparently she did not know who that was. Spoke to the waitress with the blue hair one more time to ask a question regarding Togo orders in the future... and explained that I would have liked to have a drink while I had waited ... and apparently she was to busy to to be bothered and told me as much ...  I am so sorry I inconvenienced this establishment and tried spend my money there."}
{"text":"I was at your grand opening, I was there after, and I'm not there anymore. 

Wild Thaiger was never a great option for Thai in the valley. There aren't really any terrible aspects about the restaurant, it's just that nothing really makes you say \"wow! this is good.\"

My last visit was with a friend who doesn't get out much, his wife likes good ol' steak and potatoes, so I thought I'd take him somewhere he couldn't go otherwise. Bad choice. We ordered the peanut chicken and it tasted more like peanut butter chicken. It was overpowering, and also one of the first times I have ever sent a dish back and asked for something else. Of course the service is good, they never have anything better to do."}
{"text":"Spring rolls and chicken pad Thai were absolutely amazing. The spring rolls were super fresh and the flavor profile was quite complex.Discovered this place from watching Diners, Drive one and Dives, and we were not disappointed. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"If you can get past the goofy name, the food is pleasing in every way. How the staff behind the line can pump out delicious dishes like the best pad thai I've ever had, present each plate in something resembling high art, and not explode despite a fast-food pace is beyond my meager understanding. It's an Eastern thing, dude.

Also amazing: The female wait staff. Just go. You'll see what I mean. Yeah. Incredible.

Anyway, a good place to remember on North Central."}
{"text":"I've been there twice for lunch during the week.  Food was very good both times.  One of the times, I went they took a long time to bring us the check.  Otherwise, it was very good and I intend on going there more regularly."}
{"text":"Had lunch here last year, I was presently surprised! The building is unique, the location sublime, and the cuisine is way above average. I am big on the yellow chicken curry - Yum!

Had dinner here recently, I was somewhat surprised that it was not the same tremendous experience I had remembered at lunch so long ago. Perhaps they are slipping, or more likely I am :)"}
{"text":"This is absolutely The best Thai restaurant anywhere!  I have had  these culinary  masterpieces since they first opened and can never get tired of all the  delicious  flavors  each dish has. From the  appetizers  ( Dragon Eggs) to the specialty dishes ( Pineapple Prawns) to the unbelievable desserts ( Lemon Ginger Cheasecake)  You  could NOT be disappointed ! Ola takes great pride in all her creations and  is usually always there  right along side  her gifted  team.  I could not end this review  without  giving  kudos to the talented wait staff  who are all  great but  I gotta give a special shout out to M & A  !"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this place out and left feeling very disappointed. I had the Pad Se-Eiw which was very bland. I had to drench it in soy sauce and seasoning for it to have any flavor. My friend has the Kimow and said he liked it, but not spicy as listed. I would say go ahead and skip this place as there are many better Thai restaurants in the Valley."}
{"text":"I've been going here for two years. The service is always pleasant and the food is consistently good!"}
{"text":"This is about my 1st time here:

PROS:
-Delicious Pad Thai & Panang Curry.
-They have indoor & outdoor seating.
-One of the male servers was very friendly & refilled our waters constantly.

CONS:
-Menu is kind of confusing.
-When it got busier later in the night, it took a long time for my table to get our split checks.
-Their drinks are expensive.
-This Thai restaurant is on the more pricier side.
-It's small inside. The American parties like to talk very loud."}
{"text":"Really, really yummy Thai food. And good service. All five of us selected different meals and every single one was a hit. My only suggestion would have been for maybe a cup of ice cream for the birthday girl. But, overall, a really fine experience. Not a five star location or venue, but really, ya gotta rate the food and service. Nicely done! It's the AYE of the Thaiger!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times, but have to admit it gets rougher each time.  First off just be prepared to wait at lunch or get there a bit early, I don't fault them for that, it comes with the location.  The service though, rush or not, has gotten progressively worse each time.  Food is quite good, and I have not had any issues with how spicy, or not, the dishes I have tried here have been.  I used to consider this a front runner in this part of town for Thai, but I think it is more on par with Hut and Elephant now."}
{"text":"Long wait but nice vibe.  Bartender was friendly and helpful.  Food presentation was superb but lacked in flavor."}
{"text":"Seriously the BEST Pad Thai I have ever had!  It was so fresh and had awesome veggies in it! I even tried my sons Curry and the chicken fried rice! Impressive! 
I can not wait to to go back! I was bummed it took so long but then I realized it was worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix.  Had a Thai food craving.  What a gem this was to find!  Great food!  Lovely setting."}
{"text":"A popular Thai restaurant conveniently located in downtown Phoenix. Crowded at lunch, but the service was still quite good. The food is okay, nothing spectacular but nothing to send back either. We ate on the patio and enjoyed the misters. Inside it was too crowded and noisy for us. This is the kind of place to which I would return if somebody wished us to go there, but I don't think I'd even suggest it as our destination."}
{"text":"The Thai food here is relatively Americanized, but hey, it tastes great regardless. The portions are large and they offer a wide variety of dishes. One unique feature to Wild Thaiger is that in addition to being a Thai restaurant, it's a Thai bar as well. They offer many Asian beers and Indochina-themed cocktails. They have seating indoors and out with a patio view of Central Avenue. The restaurant can be a bit easy to miss, especially for those used to Phoenix' usual parking-in-front cityscape, as it is in an older part of the city with the parking lot through an alley, behind the building. The food is delicious and the drinks are really good."}
{"text":"\"Thai\" offers so many great pun opportunities for naming a restaurant, and it's great to see an establishment take advantage of it. Wild Thaiger is a top 5 use of \"Thai\" in a pun for a restaurant.

Other contenders:

\"Thaired Elephant\" - for a slow paced dining experience that you will remember
\"Thai-Died\" - for a restaurant inherited by hippies
\"My Thaip of Food\" - to cast a wide net
\"Thair Cuts\" - to draw in confused people who want to get their hair cut but might buy Thai food if you get them in the restaurant

\"Wild Thaiger\" is a pretty good name for this place though. It serves Thai food, which is pretty important for a restaurant to do if it's going to have \"Thai\" in its name. No feral waitresses or staff appeared during our visit, which led me to believe the \"Wild\" element is probably just stylistic.

So 5 stars.

Good for: people who appreciate puns in restaurant names.
Bad for: people who want to see wild animals. I would recommend a zoo for that."}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended to us. So we thought we would give it a try..

I ordered the vegetable hot pot, which was a big portion it was steaming in a pot with a flame. It stayed lit the whole time and kept the soup nice and hot..

Other places the flame goes out and the soup ends up being cold.

We would come here more often, but we are not on that side of town much.

If you love Thai food, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Terrible service! Waited 40 min for a cold dinner. Poor table service! Will not return! Get some good help and great servers like Switch!! Read your Yelp reviews!"}
{"text":"I'm kind of biased as I love their peanut chicken and have for years. I haven't tried much else from their menu except the soup (which was also d'lish). My girlfriend tells me that their curry chicken is among the best she has ever had. I'll take her word for it as I hate curry."}
{"text":"A great little gem downtown for tasty Thai food..I love the Beef Panang and they used to have these wonderful \"Freshie Rolls\" that I would think about on a daily basis, but they took them away!! Plllease bring them back! I also love the coconut ice cream. 

Service can be a little spotty and that is my only trouble with this great family owned restaurant."}
{"text":"Since enjoying authentic Thai food in Bangkok and particularly at the Oriental Hotel 20 years ago, I have waited for the day that a Thai restaurant somewhere else approached the delicate blend of flavors of those first tastes. It happened at Wild Thaiger. The soup and the curry were wild and wonderful, and this weekend we were dismayed to find out that we couldn't get take-out before 5pm, but we will be back soon. Big portions. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The tom kra gai was delicious but I really wasn't very impressed with the basil chicken dish mainly because the chicken was so dry. I ordered thai hot for both and they just put the chilis on top of the chicken so it wasn't spicy.. Like at all. The service was really fast even though we sat outside during lunch rush and she was so friendly!!!"}
{"text":"My friends were wanting Thai food and I suggested we go to Wild Thaiger, since it's so good. So we walk in, it's not very busy. Several open tables. The hostess says to wait and runs into the kitchen to talk to a woman putting take out food into bags, she slowly comes back and says \"we're understaffed and it will be about 10min before a waiter can get to us\". I said that's fine, and asked can we just go sit at the empty table of four then and we'll wait. She looked at me like I said something foreign and refused and said no. I said we can't be seated at the empty table for our party? At this point I'm getting mad and say to her I don't understand why you're refusing to seat us and can wait but you want us to stand in front of the hostess desk. I said never mind, we're leaving, never have been refused to be seated before. She didn't answer, gave me a dirty look and we walked out. I've never experienced anything like that. It's not my fault your understaffed on a weekend, you could have easily seated us with no problem. Absolute horrendous customer service. I've been to your place many times and will not be returning after that."}
{"text":"There is nothing here, not the food, not the service, not the \"ambiance\", that's worth the inexplicable and inexcusable wait for food to be delivered when the place is half empty to begin with.  I'm done."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Thai place. I love the food here. Usually, my husband and I split the Tom-Ka-Jah (I think thats how its spelled), aka, the coconut soup. Very, very delicious. We have had Thai food all over Phoenix, and this is definitely one of the best. We also really enjoy the Pad Woon Sen, which is the clear noodle dish. Very, very tasty."}
{"text":"Great delicious food with good service here. The only thing is that if you are here and they are busy it might take you awhile to get fed. The kitchen is small...... Drinks are awesome and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"UPDATE 5/19/2008

Finally. Me and the Thaiger are purring like happy kittens. I've discovered their yellow curry at lunch and it is dee lish! Prices are insanely low, tho the lunch menu is limited. Service is upbeat and more polished. Now, a purrrrfect place for me to lunch!!! Hello Kitty!!!!

I think Hello Kitty is wildier than this cat. 
Veggie tempura. I've had crispier wafers from a priest. 

Pad Thai. Wouldn't say it was bad, but, hmmm, what's the word I'm thinking of, oh, I know BLAND! I've had tastier wafers from a priest. 

I love the chef. Very approachable and like, totally, super nice.

 Wait staff, on the two occasions I've been there, were a little inactive. I've had more action from a priest. 

I'll go again. Try new things. But only after I do the Rosary."}
{"text":"Good place but not the best I've had. I'm going to list what we ate in the order of our favorites, Lahb, freshie rolls, papaya salad and dragon eggz. The lahb was really good and I never had it with mint leaves (i'm stealing that btw). I wish they served it with lettuce instead of cabbage, should have asked. The freshie rolls and papaya salad were what I expected and tasted good. 
We were actually disappointed with the dragon eggz. If there was shrimp and crab in there I would have never known. Just tasted like a pork meatball in a wrapper. It was really dense too like they mixed it and shaped it too much. 
Service was excellent and the place was clean and looked nice. If I were in the area and wanted Thai food I would go back, but I wouldn't go out of my way, and I wouldn't go just for the dragon eggz."}
{"text":"I'll admit to occasional skepticism of DDD featured restaurants, but I've dined here pre and post DDD, so its not a factor in this review. In fact, I'd much rather drop into the Wild Thaiger (love the name) than its more illustrious and aging neighbor Durant's. 

We sampled a couple of soups and peanut chicken on our latest visit and, as usual, loved all the selections. We arrived for dinner a bit early on a weeknight and had no wait. Service was prompt and courteous. Menu pricing is reasonable for the quality and location. The kitchen is open concept (sorry, I'm mixing up DDD with Home Hunters) and visible to the curious if you like seeing your food prepared. And the décor is part tiger, part Thai. 

There are a lot of excellent Thai spots in the Valley, making it a very competitive category in which to earn a five star review. Wild Thaiger is very close. It's also just a bit different from the norm. We always do soup at the Thaiger, not our norm. If you have a passion for Thai cuisine, definitely give Wild Thaiger a try. I wish it was located a bit closer to where I live so that I could more easily frequent it and ponder an upgrade to five stars."}
{"text":"I've been here about a dozen times now and I have never written a review.... but I could write a super review for each of those times.  Tonight I was on my own so I got galee gai and sticky rice to go.  The galee gai is a spicy yellow curry - similar to masaman curry but spicier.  Now, I am a total wimp and this is always spicier than I really can handle but it is so good I deal with it!  I put it on rice and drink a lot of tea :-)  The sticky rice is coconut sweet and, well, sticky.  I have ordered sticky rice at other places and it never compares to Wild Thaiger.  I am happy to have leftovers for lunch tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place. Went here last night with my family after seeing it the day before on DDD. Great food and a great atmosphere.

We started off our meal with the Dragon Eggz. They come either steamed or fried, we did 1/2 and 1/2 so that we could try both textures. Would definitely suggest doing that again.

We ordered the Seafood Panang, which was good for two people to share.

Other members in our party ordered the Mu Yang (the sauce is amazing), Galee Gai and the Holy Basil Chicken.

After everything the wait staff brought us the More Mango Cheesecake which was complete sin in every bite.

We all left the restaurant full and with nothing but good things to say.


*CAVEAT*
The only thing I would forewarn is that the wait is a little long and service is at times a little bit slow. That's what kept this from getting that elusive 5th star."}
{"text":"Craving Thai, I wasn't willing to drive all the way up to Siam Thai, on 51st Ave and Northern, to get my fix and I had yet to try the Thai my own neighborhood had to offer. Deciding on Wild Thaiger, I chose to save Thai Hut for another time. 

They offer ample parking behind the restaurant and patio dining if you so choose. Seeing no one out on the patio (yea it was warm out but not that uncomfortable), I entered the restaurant and was greeting and seated quickly, choosing a spot at the bar. 

Thai iced tea in hand I reviewed the menu. Hummm, ok pretty standard menu, but being a fan of curries I noted my choices were limited. I guess I could have had them sub the beef for chicken in the dishes but I wasn't feeling up for the hassle. 
After a process that seemed like forever, I decided to start off with the Tofu Towers Appetizer and settled on the Green Curry with beef. 

The tofu towers were well presented with a cucumber \"chutney\" / salad that was fresh with a vinegarette that still didn't do much for the tofu. [The same cucumber salad vinegarette at Siam Thai is more clean and crisp.] While green curry's are not generally my favorite (I often find them bland and less flavorful than a red), the beef green curry was tasty. The heat was one that built up slowly as you ate but was never overwhelming to the overall dish. The jasmine rice was cooked perfectly. 

While overall I can't complain, I can say I have had better but it is a worthy option when seeking a quick Thai fix. Still craving a good curry I guess I know what I will be making at home this weekend. Or maybe I will try Thai Hut."}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand all the raves about this place.  I saw it reviewed on PBS last Sunday and thought I'd give it a try.  It was pretty Meh for me.  Certainly not worth the drive across town.  I ordered the Tom Ka Gai and their basil chicken.  The chicken in both were like shoe leather--so tough I had to pull out the chunks of chicken and cut saw them with my knife.  While the seasoning was pretty good in the soup it was very very thin and watery and there was a TON of strips of lemon grass in it that I had to try and pull out---like I had a total pile of lemon grass on a napkin when I was finished.  The  basil chicken was not much better.  Watery sauce and minimal flavoring.  

I lived in Bangkok for two years.  Honestly, the best food there is from street vendors.  This place was far from good Thai food."}
{"text":"Galee gai is the cure-all for allergies, the flu or a hangover. Trust me, I know hangovers.
The waitresses are all amazing and beautiful and nice.
Friday and Saturday nights usually yield an awkward wait (who was really here first?).
I have never had a bad meal or experience here."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and each time was amazing! 
The pad Thai is worth writing home about and the temple of fire has just the right amount if spice.

Not only is the food, good it is also consistent. The service is friendly and never keeps you waiting too long!"}
{"text":"Authentic Thai restaurant with specialty dishes that are truly unique. I love this place because I can bring friends and family knowing they have basic dishes to adventurous ones. Service can be spotty when it's busy but the food makes it worth it."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken pad Thai. Fresh ingredients, perfect mixture of noodles, meat, and veggies (for me, but my son would have liked more meat). I asked for spicier the 2nd time I ate it and they brought out some type of spicy sauce to add. I was disappointed because I like my spice cooked in. Perhaps they didn't trust me that I would eat it spicier? I made a ginger garlic chicken stir fry this week and I sliced 5 large jalapeños in it and it was fine. I'm okay with a little more spice."}
{"text":"Man oh man wow this is some of the best Thai food I've ever had not much to say as I need to be carried out of here due to my food coma enjoy the pics."}
{"text":"This was my second time coming to this resturant and my husband's first,  and it will most certainly not be our last! We were quickly seated and drinks were promptly served. There was a short wait on our food, but it was great and well worth the wait. We ordered chicken spring rolls, chicken curry, chicken pad thai, and 2 drinks.  Our total came out to $32.22, not bad at all. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great food but service is just, meh.  Had to refill my own water twice.  Too bad this place has potential to be great but employees don't seem to care."}
{"text":"Showed up at 8:10 pm on a Saturday night. There were three larger parties (about 8 people each) seated; otherwise the place was mostly empty. Two waitresses ignored us, one cleaning a table that was obviously not needed. 

After waiting for about five minutes, I asked one of the waitresses about being seated. She said she would get a hostess. 

The hostess comes out and explained that we wouldn't be seated for about 30 minutes because of the large party that just arrived. Because the restaurant was about 70% empty and they wouldn't seat us, we left. 

I realize that this restaurant was featured on the Food Network so I'm assuming the food is great; however, if a hostess doesn't seat guests in a nearly-empty restaurant, I also assume they don't want to serve us."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I haven't reviewed this place! I have been here a handful of times and each time it has been consistently good. My favorite item is the 24 K curry, which is a spicy green curry that features some delicious veggies (japanese eggplant that is melt in your mouth (probably the best eggplant I've ever had... I don't typically like eggplant), squash, and green beans). I usually add chicken and have more than enough food for two meals. Wild Thaiger has decent specials on some nights of the week for drinks (Mondays feature 5$ martinis). My only complaint about the Thaiger is that, unlike other Thai restaurants, they do not allow you to choose your spiciness level. I understand that some dishes may be better spicy or mild, but I would like to have the option available. I would say that Wild Thaiger is the best Thai food I have had in the downtown area and would recommend it."}
{"text":"December - You might need to be patient with the new cook. The service, recipes, and patio are still 5-Star, but some of the dishes are a little shaky. Wild Thaiger has always been spot-on with their staff, so I'm certain he'll be amazing in no time."}
{"text":"Two Words. Holy Basil !!!
p.s  thai spicy..."}
{"text":"This was amazing. We saw it on diners, drive-ins and dives and had to go try it out. It did not disappoint"}
{"text":"Wow! This restaurant was on our list of go-to's from being on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. We were not disappointed whatsoever :) We got steamed dragon eggz, shrimp pad thai, and pad sei-ew. All three were absolutely amazing, we're definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has great pad Thai as well as other dishes to offer. It has a good heart missand I like going to actually sit and eat there. It's a little bit pricey but not too bad and it's in a good location."}
{"text":"Food:  the Tom Yum Goog soup (with shrimp and chicken) is a food score 10 - a Phoenix, AZ best dish."}
{"text":"Wow what a great flavor for the dishes we had it was nearly impossible to stop eating even after our belly was completely full. The waiter was really great as well knew the food and had been there since the place opened. He gave is great recommendations all super delish. It was a really positive experience we will go back!"}
{"text":"Every time I've been to Wild Thaiger the food has been amazing, and last night was no different. My friend and I went to check out the \"Wine Down Wednesday\" special, which means you can get any international wines for only $5 per glass (this is a great deal as they have some pretty awesome wines). 

As for food last night, we shared an app and entree. We started with the Island Crab, which is a crispy shell with crab meat on top - like a deconstructed wonton type of thing, only better! I love the fact that you can see and taste huge delicious chunks of crab, instead of the typical 95% cream cheese filling in most crab wontons. Awesome. For our 'entree' we had a special for the evening that was Thai Sausage and vegetables. It was yummy, and I was even afraid to 'dive in' because the presentation was gorgeous! 

In previous experiences here I've had Pad Thai, Holy Basil Chicken, Peanut Passion and Beef Mangone. All of them were awesome, beautifully presented and my personal favorite... tasted FRESH! I love that every time I've been here the food has been consistently awesome. Fresh flavors, enough spice to taste (you can pick your level on most items), great flavor combos without going overboard - I like that you can taste all the different ingredients instead of having them masked by one or two overpowering flavors. 

Last night I had the privilege of meeting the owner, Olashawn. She's an awesome woman with a passion for what she does, and one of the most down-to-earth people I've ever met. If you go in, make sure to give her a wave, you'll see her behind the counter and behind the line, cooking and working just as hard if not harder then everyone else."}
{"text":"Really surprised to hear of the Sanitation issue in November... but more the way that person was treated, if that's how it went down.  Will be cautious, but will still go.  GREAT lunch... a bit slow sometimes, but if you have 45 min or so, it's fabulous.  REALLY good vegetarian panang... YUM."}
{"text":"I love going to Thaiger! The food is always great; I have never been disappointed. It's also in a cool location and has a very unique atmosphere on the inside. Best Thai food in Phoenix in my opinion."}
{"text":"Had the papaya salad and the Pad Thai. Both were very good. Plus the portions are the right size so I was full without having leftovers...."}
{"text":"I used to really like the place, but lately the food has been just okay. and the curries have been a little on the watery side. I am particularly unhappy that Wild Thaier now makes things hot by merely sprinkling dried chili flakes over the entire dish, rather than cooked with the dish. Still, the food is not bad and it's a good lunch."}
{"text":"Let me say that this is by far the best Thai food I have had in Phoenix. The atmosphere is great very friendly staff we were seated right away and made to feel right at home. I had the strawberry Champagne Martini it was very well made. I must say this place is great for a first date anniversary or valentines the owner is wonderful I recommend this place as a romantic spot for a couple. I will continue to go back as long as they are opened."}
{"text":"I saw this in Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives and I had to try it.  I really enjoyed the food! It's probably the best Thai I've had since I moved to Phoenix.  I happened to go with some friends, one of whom ran her own Thai restaurant. She agreed the food was excellent. We had to ask for the spice rack which was fine. And then she doctored our pad see-ew with jalapeño vinegar and spices which was delicious. The dragon eggs in particular were fabulous. The satay, basil chicken, panang curry, and mango sticky rice were great as well. The only item we didn't enjoy was the Papaya salad which was missing fish sauce. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is definitely a place you want to come to to eat some dishes with vibrant flavors. The dishes we ordered had great flavors and had the right amount of spice. Expect to wait for about 15-20 minutes to be seated, we went on a Sunday night and it felt like we had to wait forever! I would make reservations before coming here."}
{"text":"My 2nd time here, last time was part of a big group, this time was much better! Able to relax and enjoy it! Had kimow chicken and must warn, it hot! But I like my Thai food hot!! My date ,he had the beef panang(red curry beef) also had Thai iced tea for drinks, definitely needed something cold and refreshing!! and for dessert, omg! Had lemon ginger cheescake, was fantastic!!  Love this place and plan to return!!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here last night and was disappointed.  The portion size for the chicken curry was very small and I asked to add extra vegetables to the curry (bc otherwise it only comes with potatoes and onions) and didn't see that they had added any.  The amount of rice they provided with the curry was also teeny tiny.  On top of that, a takeout order takes 35 minutes (I ordered at 5:20 pm, not a peak time).  Also they were out of mango for their sticky rice and didn't have any alternatives like custard or anything to serve with the sticky rice.  Meh, never ordering takeout from here again."}
{"text":"Fantastic, got a Hot Soup Tom gun going I believe, very tasty, ended with some fantastic Thai ice coffee and average coconut ice cream, ask for Fawn, she is very attentative and sweet"}
{"text":"Solid Thai food.  The food was spicier than I'm used to, and the options included oddities such as Catfish Prigking (super spicy Catfish that I had to chase with tons of Sangria) and the 24K curry (absolutely delicious but still burn-on-both-ends hot).  My friend had Pad Cha Seafood, which also burned beautifully.  I'm guessing this is what Thai food is really like in Thailand (minus the large amounts of seafood), though, so I'll stop complaining.  I'm a spice whimp.

The place is a little expensive and the portions are a little small, but I think the $4 Sangria more than made up for that.

All in all, would totally return."}
{"text":"It was Guy that sparked my interest in this place with Triple D then the moment the fried dragon eggs touched my taste buds I had no choice but to become a lifetime member of the Wild Thaiger fan club. My stomach is growling just thinking about their insanely delicious food. From the Penang Curry to the Papaya Salad its the best Thai I've ever had and I've had a lot of Thai food. On rare occasions I can't remember if the staff was any good or not because I'm so into the food, this is one of those places. I can't say enough about the food here, I might add that the presentation is rather good as well. 

5 Star without hesitation."}
{"text":"I've had better.  

 My wife and I were very excited to try this place based on reviews. The staff was very nice, but a little slow it seemed. 

Our food took a very long time to come out to us, and one of the appetizers showed  up along with the entrees.

I was pumped to try the Decha Boar, not only because it was boar, but it was listed as being \"Thai Spicy\". Everything is presented nicely, but nice presentation doesn't make up for taste. When my entree came out, the meat was very dry, and it was about as spicy as canned Rosarita spicy refried beans, which means it wasn't.  My wife told me that her Seafood Panang was relatively bland.  The best things we had that night were the appetizers, which were seafood pancake and dragon eggs.  We may go back one day, but it will be way off in the future.  

If you want good Thai food that will satisfy without all the overdone presentation, just go to Sala Thai."}
{"text":"Had the Chicken Lettuce Wraps -- that was Great! (Wanted more but had to stop myself)

Panag was good, others tried Pad Thai. Overall food quality was good, service was pleasant and quick. Great spot for dinner after work. The price was on point too."}
{"text":"I dunno...  the rest of the people at my table all had the Pad Thai, and all of them said it was excellent.  I had the seafood panang curry and thought that it was kind of dull and flavorless...  I really didn't like the presentation where I had to kind of help the rice find it's way to the curry and the seafood on the dish.  It looked fantastic, but when you aren't provided a spoon to do any pouring, it becomes a little awkward.

The service was great.  The iced tea was weird.  No WiFi...  Eh...  I've had better, but this restaurant was very convenient..."}
{"text":"Not very spicy, which is a negative for a thai place, but excellent in every other way. Great flavors, well-prepared, great service, good outdoor seating with misters."}
{"text":"Weak 4. Very pretty restaurant, nice staff and ample parking space behind the restaurant. The sake cosmo is really good. The freshie rolls are excellent - I love the chicken and shrimp combo, the fresh mint, and the delicious peanut sauce. I thought the Kao Pad Jay was really good - the tofu was cooked well, and the rice was really rich and delicious. The vegetables in the dish were room temperature and cooler relative to the rice, so I'm wondering if they used frozen veggies rather than fresh (or maybe a combo). Good, but not sure I would get it again. The pad thai was yummy and beautifully plated. I can see myself coming back."}
{"text":"Ample parking in back, but spaces are narrow.
Food is delicious.
Prices are a bit higher on average for Thai places I've been to around town."}
{"text":"This place is really our favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix area by far. The corn fritter appetizer is so yummy and I love their pad thai, which I usually get vegetarian with tofu. I have not had any veggie pad thai that is better anywhere else!  Wish it were closer to us, we'd go a lot more often if it was."}
{"text":"Love the accommodating menu and atmosphere.. I can't wait to go back, I'm already craving their chicken basil.. umm umm good!!"}
{"text":"Great Satay and pretty good Pad Thai!

What really got me though was how much Guy Fieri I saw.... as if he didn't already haunt all of our dreams already!

As I dined on my chicken pad Thai noodles slowly turned into his frosted tips and that's all I could think about. 

Overall Wild Thai was a good experience but, even a little bit of Guy Fieri is A LOT."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and was decently impressed with this place. Had the green curry which wasn't Thai hot like I had asked but still somewhat spicy. Was disappointed that they did not bring/have fish sauce with Thai chili peppers to add some more salty spiciness to the curry. Impressed that there was not a selection of meats for each of the curries, they are specific to each and was cooked excellently and especially tender. Looking forward to trying some more traditional Thai dishes from here again."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Wild Thaiger since 2006!! This is some of the most scrumptious thai food i have had hands down in the Phoenix area.  You HAVE to have the thai iced tea, peanut chicken, and the veggie rolls...yummmm.

The only negative is I recently went there on the weekend and the service was HORRIBLY slow because they only had one server for the whole restaurant, although small.  Im not sure if this was just an unusual day or what because during the week they are speedy.

Love this place!"}
{"text":"I went to wild Thaiger for dinner with three friends and although the service was good in a clean environment, the food was disappointing. The flavors and preparation is just not authentic. I am reviewing the food with the background of having traveled to Thailand and having lived most of my life in larger culturally diverse cities (NY, Chicago, DC) with close authentic thai food. Here are some critiques:

Pad Kee Mao - My favorite noodle dish of all time is supposed to be prepared with thick rice noodles sauteed to a variety of textures, and infused with a dizzying array of spice. Instead, the dish here is made with thin vermacilli noodles and tasted like a lump of wet ricey dough. I even explicitly asked for it to be extra spicy, but there was barely any.

Pad thai - This basic Thai staple was presented as a soggy clump of noodles with a watery sauce pooling at the bottom of the plate. The worse part was that despite all of that sauce, it was tasteless except for the peanuts sprinkled on top. There was no hint of tamarind or fish sauce or chili. Disgrace.

Tom Yum (chicken) - Again, what we received was a flavorless broth. There was no taste of lemongrass, no curry, and the chicken was dry.

Needless to say, this was very disappointing. For a large restaurant in a prominent location, the food served up here was worse than some of the shacks I've eaten out of in other cities.

Two stars for service and cleanliness alone, none for food."}
{"text":"Only because I can't give them 0 stars. They really need to get it together. Supposedly they do not take reservations, but they were unable to seat us. This would be fine if they didn't have 5 empty \"reserved\" tables. (In fact, we were told there was no where to even wait and when we tried to order a beer at the bar, we were told that someone might be able to get it in 5-10 minutes. After 15 minutes we gave up and went outside without so much as a water.) The hostess let us know several times that they were understaffed, but with only 12 tables and 4 waitstaff it shouldn't have been an issue.  40 minute of standing around and they finally pulled together two open tables and sat our \"large party\" of 5. They then proceeded to tell us that it would \"be a while\" until someone would be out to take our order, and no they wouldn't be able to take our drink orders now. Then, we had to watch while our server took orders from a party of 13 who weren't even completely seated yet! At this point, we took the hint and headed over to the Phoenix Public Market Cafe!! I don't care if they are featured on every food network show, until they figure out how to run a restaurant (and lose the attitude) we won't be back!"}
{"text":"We came here in between the shows of Angels in America at Phoenix Theatre.  Although not large they were able to get us seated very quickly.  The rest if the service was not very fast or attentive but once the food arrives it didn't matter.  My hubby got yellow curry which he though very good and the presentation with cabbage curls was lovely.  I had the Island Fried Rice and it was a perfect portion of rice with fruit, veggies and rice.  In addition the presentation for this was beautiful.  The drinks were good and we had the wonderful cocnut ice cream which on that hot summer day tasted and felt so very good.  The food is wonderful here and the decor is very nice as well.  The cook mingled in the small restaurant which was nice.   There was a long by the time we left.  Had the service been better they might have got 5 stars."}
{"text":"Living in Chandler I never would have found this place unless I had to meet a friend who was in town staying near by.  I read many reviews and even with many complaining about the service, we gave it a try.

First upon arriving I was met by a friendly hostess, who offered to get me a beer while I waited for my friend.  When I went to pay she said don't worry, it will be added on your bill. Now I like that in a place!

When seated our server (huge smile) immediatley was there offering all of us more drinks, so far I find nothing like those that have complained.

Since it was a Friday during lent my friend could not have meat so we ordered with our drinks the veg sampler app.  It came and was fantastic and most suprisingly light.  I ordered as a main the seafood panang and it was so good.  The panang sauce had great flavor with a  nice touch of heat on the backside.  None of it remained.  My friend ordrered the mango shrimp and ate every bite of that.

Finally anyone who does not have mango and sticky rice at a Thai joint is nuts in my opinion so of course we ordered that.  Just delicious!  

So this place is legit, good service and good food.  I would if I could give it 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"I like this place. Although it gets really busy around noon. My favorite dish is gapraogui. I love how the kitchen is visable, while you are dining, and you dont smell like the kitchen when you leave. I mostly go for the food, its not a place I would hang out there with people and drink."}
{"text":"OK I loved Wild Thaiger before, but the recent changes to the menu are PHENOMENAL!!! The corn fritters are like crispy crunchy clouds of YUM!!  I love that they WILL custom spice anything. And the coconut water adult beverage is absolutely SCRUMPTIOUS 
The service is good, not Great, but not in any way bad. This is a FAVORITE"}
{"text":"Good flavor but the ribs were like room temperature. The dragon balls are worth the drive !!!!!"}
{"text":"We were visiting the Heard museum and we decided to stop in for lunch, it was during the week, it was a great meal. We split the chicken pad thai and had some spring rolls. Great service and the place was busy, which is always a plus in my eyes. I would love to come and check out this place for happy hour, I have a feeling it would be a good time. I'll be back the next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My friend Ric told me about this place, although he had never been there. Upon walking through the door, you are greeted by a life-size poster of Guy Fierri (?) and apparently this place made it to Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, one of my favorite shows and I missed this episode! Who has time for TV anyway? I enjoyed the swanky upscale interior design but this also led me to conclude that it would be a pricy experience. I was right. As it is hard to put a price on a great experience, the food was SOOOO good that I would have gladly paid double! I brought my folks with me a couple weeks after my first visit - they loved it too. Among the dishes we enjoyed: Spring rolls (pictured), the specialty Holy Basil Chicken (Thai green chili, Garlic, and Aromatic Basil $11.95), the Tom Ka Gai soup (Traditional spices, chicken, mushrooms, coconut soup) $9.95 ... and, of course, the Thai Iced Tea. On my next visit I want to try the Volcano Wraps (Insane chicken wraps with lemongrass, ginger, and thai chilies. Hot! $7.95), and also the Tom Yum Goong soup (Hot and spicy shrimp with mushrooms and tomatoes - $13.95) and finally, the Mi Dang Dang (Red BBQ pork, Soba noodles, sweet sauce, sprouts, Hard boiled egg - $10.95) but hey, that's on my next visit. Mouth is watering now. The food tastes BETTER than the photos look on their website, which is a mind-blowing paradox. Believe the hype this time, you'll see - just go. This is one of the best restaurants in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic. Dragon eggs and Basil chicken my faves. Had at least 10 different items off the menu and enjoyed if family style. Great service and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is some of the best Thai food I have ever eaten. We got a hot pot that was delicious and chicken pad Thai. We will definitely be back. Forgot to take pictures we were too excited to eat"}
{"text":"Great service and okay food. I ordered 5-Spicy level ( where 4 is Thai hot) and the food came out tasting sweet. I love La's Thai on McDowell and Hayden much better"}
{"text":"Years past, Wild Thaiger was a moribund place serving bland, forgettable fare so I barely recognized it when our party of six stopped in last night for my mom's birthday. 

White tablecloth, good cutlery, big wine glasses, open kitchen, spicy dishes presented with flair - I'm impressed! I had beef Kiewan, a delicious green curry that packed solid (American-gauge) heat. The corn fritters are crunchy and good, served with jalapenos and cucumber. The coconut milk-based soup with chicken was a hit around the table. Pork, beef, ribs, vegetarian, salmon - everything got a solid thumbs up. 

Good drinks. Our server was first rate and unusually sweet. Maybe it's not cutting edge Scottsdale, but Wild Thaiger serves up tongue tingling food at fair prices in an attractive interior space.  They've stepped up, and if you're in the neighborhood, you should too."}
