{"text":"Pizza is Not that great. The service is excellent everyone is nice and helpful. If you are from the states, you will not like the pizza it's different taste. Try the coconut pie it was delicious!"}
{"text":"It won best pizza in the the city! I recommend to go there if you are looking for a great pizza to enjoy.. I went there for a first date once and we ordered a pizza and when they brought it to us they wrote lovers with the sauce on the pan next to are pizza. There breakfast is also good there. The best thing about that place I would have to say isn't the pizza it is the staff. They treat you and talk to you as if you were family they will always ask how is your family etc. ....love Louis pizza"}
{"text":"Excellent establishment, friendly staff, I  always recommend this place, the food is fantastic it's been a family tradition for years"}
{"text":"Hi there, my name is Riley Brockington and i just love Louis Pizza. If yiu dont like it, there must be somethin wrong with you.
Kind regards

{"text":"The restaurant itself is not much to look at but it has amazing food.
The staff is always friendly.
The pizza is great!  The toppings & portions are generous."}
{"text":"Great pizza. I hear everything on the menu is awesome, but I always stick with the bacon pizza! Delish!!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza crust I have ever had. Light and fluffy but still filling. Amazing! The staff is super friendly and even when they are busy still get your food out fast!!"}
{"text":"Gosh I've not had a pizza with such generous toppings before! Love it! Cozy and warm."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place cause people said it was great but it ended up making my family sick."}
{"text":"Louis' is one of those restaurants in Ottawa that has a bit of a cult status with residents, but its existence isn't usually known by visitors or newcomers. If you asked many residents in a poll what the best pizza place is, many of them would say Louis'. I don't necessarily agree (Colonnade all the way!), but it's definitely up there on my list. 

Their pizza is delicious, simple, extra cheesy and uniquely flavoured. I think they use nutmeg and/or cinnamon in their dough because it has a very mild spicy sweet flavour usually found in cinnamon buns in stronger doses. 

The shop looks more like an old diner than a pizzeria; they even have a jukebox, which just adds to the flavour of this establishment. The servers are very down to earth and they often seem to know a significant chunk of customers in the room, since Louis' definitely has its share of regulars.

Also, if you're lame like me, go to the bowling alley behind Louis' for a fun  evening with friends."}
{"text":"Always amazing service with a smile, delicious food... 
And good family atmosphere ! 
A+++ pizza! Best in town and that's a fact"}
{"text":"Louis is a family run restaurant with excellent food, reasonable prices and friendly service.  Breakfasts are as good as it gets and, in this reviewer's opinion, they make the best pizza in town.

The decor and furnishings are old and worn, but that somehow contributes to the charm.  There are plenty of regulars and blue-collar clientele.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is my favourite pizza in Ottawa. Period.
Their pizzas are unique as mentioned in Amanda D.'s review. 
The crust is yellow and not the usual white/tan colour of most pizzas.
(lots of egg yolks?) 
Louis' pizzas are VERY thick and heavy and the complete polar opposite of a thin crust wood oven type pizza. They use good quality ingredients (the bacon is REAL bacon and not bits of simulated bacon and the ham is actual pieces of sliced ham etc.)
The cheese is tasty, stretchy and not too greasy.
The sauce has a nice tomato flavour but also a nice spicy/sweet taste. (cinnamon? nutmeg?) Not very basil or oregano flavoured like some pizza joints.
This is obviously homemade sauce and not the generic canned variety.
One important note is that Louis' DO NOT DELIVER, it's TAKE OUT or DINE IN ONLY.
I once asked them why they don't deliver and I was simply told they are just too busy to deliver.

To me this place defines Ottawa style pizza and exudes a no nonsense family run business commited to making  good food and long time customers for the past 25-30 years. (It even has 25-30 year old orange vinyl seating and wood paneling to prove it. HA HA!)

Louis is a must try for anyone looking for a good pizza, the best in town in my opinion.
I've also been told they make a pretty darn good breakfast for cheap."}
{"text":"Delivers exactly as expected, every time.

Mainly I'd come here for the ambiance (or lack thereof.)  It definitely has an identity all its own.  

The pizza isn't great; isn't bad either: humungous, greasy, thick-crust.  The coconut cream pie is great except for the crust which basically seems to be a solid piece of lard.

I say all this lovingly and highly recommend this place for a casual fun time."}
{"text":"Yes the the place looks dated but the history is long and the owner is a legend. I had the Louis to go when I visited 10 mins. before closing. The owner didn't mind that he had to stay open an extra 15 mins to bake the pizza.  The pizza was great.

He welcomes everyone with open arms and is one of the nicest people."}
{"text":"Louis is another Ottawa pizza favourite.  It's been around for a long time and sits inside a house outside a bowling alley.  This place is similar style pizza to Newport, Gabriel's and Lorenzo's.  It's the thick crust style pizza in town but they do cook their crust all the way through.  

The place doesn't have the nostalgia that Newport does.  The pizza uses some solid ingredients and the flavours are alright but this thicker crust pizza just isn't my thing.  It's a bit to doughy in the middle.  

However if you enjoy this type of pizza I do prefer it to Gabriel's and Newport."}
{"text":"I'm a little afraid to let this cat out of the bag because I may have to wait longer for pizza from this point forward! If you have been raised on Mom & Pop neighbourghood pizzerias and miss the old fashion thick crust made with really great ingerdients, then you will fall in love with Louis. Ohhhh that dough! I am smittened by it! I would say I am very attracted to pizzas in general; I love the many styles of pizza: thin crust, wood burning, deep dish, flatbreads, you name it with the exception of chain pizzeria and frozen grocery store pizzas, which I avoid at any cost. Louis' pizzeria does pizza extremely well and I would even venture that it is one of the best traditional \"Ottawa\" P-pie I've had in recent years (not that I have been to all the Mom & Pop shops in the city YET hahaha). If you manage to eat in at Louis, you will be transported to another era: I mean this place is a total \"throwback Thursday\" everyday. That alone is worth a visit. Louis offers a full diner menu: the cream pies are decadent and I hear the rest of the menu is pretty decent too. As for me, I've only had pizza because when a craving hits, nothing else will do but a Louis Special!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite pizza place in ottawa it's family owned and the Saab family are simply amazing!
The pizza sauce is homemade the crust is crispy but never over Cooked toppings are generous the cheese (omg the cheese) everything is perfect u can't get a better pizza in the city I'm very well traveled and I haven't found a place that is as good as Louis pizza it's a must try for pizza lovers they also have tons of other home style food options on their menu."}
{"text":"Never been here before came in after bowling did not expect the kind of classic pizzeria pizza with old school atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"Highly recommend; the large  Meat Lover pizza is all very good, great portions of meats and cheese, including the thick crust is a delight to finish off. The coconut cream pie, was made fresh, served in a big slice, is most delicious the best I've ever had. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"What a gem! Absolutely great food served by wonderful people that make sure you are enjoying your meal. We had a huge poutine and large pizza that they customized to our family's taste. Nice touch! Had to try the amazing looking homemade coconut cream pie. Was awesome."}
{"text":"Voici un restaurant où on a le soucis de faire plaisir aux clients! Le patron, Louis m'a péparé une délicieuse pizza en forme de coeur avec le mot \"Bienvenue\" sur la plaque. Comment être mieux accueillie que ça! Une pizzeria aux prix abordables qui existe depuis de nombreuses années et qui conserve sa clientèle tout aussi longtemps."}
{"text":"Nous étions à la recherche d'un brunch du dimanche mais nous sommes tombés sur la pizza de chez Louis.  Laissez moi vous dire qu'on n'a pas été déçu!

Le resto est de style \"diner\" des années 60s, et même  mes parents disent se rappeler d'y avoir été des années passé (probablement durant les années 60) et me disaient qu'ils ont gardé le même style.  C'est bien entretenu et j'adore tout les souvenirs provenant de l'histoire du restaurant sur les murs.

Attention, je vous préviens la pizza est trop bonne!"}
{"text":"My husband was introduced to Louis' by a co-worker and since we were in the area visiting family, we decided to go in for lunch. 


Immediately upon entering, I notice the mass amount of pictures and other things on the wall which gave me a vibe that this place was a place that is well loved. The staff was very friendly. 

We ordered a medium Louis' Special with extra cheese to split. When it came out, it was in the shape of a heart. We hadn't asked for that but they did it special for us, which was really sweet. There were mushrooms around the edges on toothpicks as well as a little Canada flag, which was very unique. 


From the first bite, I was hooked. The crust was amazing. Very moist and while it was thick, it wasn't overly so. I didn't find it as greasy as most pizza. The toppings were nice and fresh. You can tell they put pride into their food. 


It's a family run business that treats their customers as an extension of that family and really, how could you ask for better?"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and coconut pie!!!! We had dinner there and it felt like sitting at ones family table. The service was incredible friendly and efficient. The restaurant is cozy and unique.  This place hands down has the best pizza in Ottawa."}
{"text":"Family owned authentic friendly place! Known for their big cheesy pizzas but most of everything else on the menu is delicious! Fish and chip/spagetti/veal parmesan, all so good! Fills up fast on most nights!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but if this is the best pizza in Ottawa the rest of the pizza places in town must be awful. I want to like this place and I'm hoping some of the other menu items are better than the pizza."}
{"text":"So we hadn't been to Louie's in quite a while but last night we were looking for somewhere to eat and decided to drop in. We ordered the Louie's Special and again we decided that it is still the best pizza in Ottawa. Going to this restaurant is like coming home and being greeted by family. The waitress was excellent and checked up on us frequently. The cashier was also really friendly. We plan to come back often. If your are looking for real great thick crust pizza this is the place to go."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious! And they made me a heart shaped pizza on my birthday. I see other reviewers had their names spelled out in pizza dough, and now I'm trying to not seem ungrateful for my heart-pizza.

This is an endearing divey place. If Louis' had a theme song, it would for sure be sung by the Eagles. It's the kind of pizza place where you can also buy lottery tickets.

The service is friendly and fast, and everyone is just the nicest.

I've got nothing but the greatest things to say about Louis'!"}
{"text":"Best pizza place in the region! Excellent variety in the menu, great prices, the service is good also, never been disappointed. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for great pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza here is possibly the best food I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"This is simply amazing pizza.  I am visiting from California and just stopped in.  The pizza was excellently made.  The crust was thick and flaky.  I couldn't finish even a small despite how good it was.  I took the rest home and warmed it up later.  It was still good.  It passed the test and I wish I could go back more often."}
{"text":"The vibe in this place is unreal. It's the definition of a local institution: the walls are haphazardly decorated with old photos and pictures of multiple generations of the Ottawa Senators, local politicians, historic landmarks and various other accumulated odds and ends. The menu seems to be typical diner fare but the real gem here is the pizza, and the drawings on the walls attest that it is quite possibly Ottawa's best, if not the world's (at least according to one crayon-scrawled piece of art on the walls). 

I got a small pepperoni for myself and the pan it came on had \"welcome\" written on it in pizza sauce. I guess it's that obvious that I'm a first timer (oh wait it says that on my neighbours pizza too, I guess it's just a thing they do -  nice touch). The pizza was otherworldly. It wasn't until it touched my lips that I realized this is what I have been searching for in this city for my entire life. The crust was buttery, thick and crispy on the bottom but perfectly doughy underneath the sauce providing multiple textures per bite. The sauce had a really interesting note, maybe cinnamon? Not sure but it is unique, both savoury and sweet without leaning too far in either direction. The cheese to sauce to crust ratio was perfection and every bite left a trail of cheese between my teeth and the slice, I felt like a ninja turtle. 

Do yourself a favour and don't order pizza pizza tonight. Take a trip to the weird world of Louis' Pizza in Vanier. You won't be disappointed. 


Cowabunga, dudes."}
{"text":"Loved my visit to Louis Pizza.   Here's why:
1) Wonderful staff - everyone is smiling and happy.  The staff know the regulars and treat  newcomers (us) just as well as their regulars.  Very genuine. 
2) Character of the place - inside and outside.  It's an old business (45 years I believe, as I write this review) and they don't try to hide it.  The walls are covered with memorabilia - including art work from customers, newspaper articles and photos.  Very fun.  The booths might be original.  It's a bit of a time warp.
3) Pizza was great.  We had the Louis' Special on thin crust.  Loved it. Their cheese is a bit different from everyone else's.   I'm guessing they use more than just mozzarella in their cheese blend - very tasty.

I recommend eating in at least once to understand more about where your pizza is coming from.  And oh, by the way, they do serve more than just pizza - but it's what they are famous for in Ottawa.

During our visit, there was a sign posted all over the place to the effect that they would be closed on a specific date for their daughter's wedding, and it offered apologies. It was so simply worded and embodied their customer service attitude.  Possibly one of the biggest days of their family's lives and they were concerned about the impact on their customers.   They are truly a part of the community in which they exist.  It's very cool. 

Really enjoyed my visit.  While they style of pizza might not be to everyone's taste (and that's ok), I think it's worth exploring.

Would I return:  Yes
Would I recommend:  Yes"}
{"text":"Tried their banana cream pie for the first time and OMG! Its amazing! The steak sub is a must have and the poutine is tasty"}
{"text":"This review is about Louis breakfast and its coconut cream pie.  While having never had the pleasure of a Louis pizza, and judging from other reviews, it is a pleasure, breakfast at Louis is not too shabby either.  Served fast, with dee-licious homefries, the ambiance of this neighbourhood joint is well worth your time and dough.

On a whim during our visit, I noticed some mile high coconut cream pies, and could not resist taking a slice home for takeout.  Mmm mmmm good.  Well worth the price.

Will have to go back for pizza some day."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in town. I've been going there since I was a child and now I bring my kids there. This restaurant is one of Ottawa's hidden treasures. No one is this city can come close to there great crust and fresh ingredients.

Only down side is the place has never been remodeled. So it still looks like the place I went to as a boy.

A must go !"}
{"text":"In researching restaurants near McArthur Lanes for a belated New Year's work social, a colleague suggested we try out Louis' Pizza. We have a few members on our team who have dietary restrictions due to allergies, religious beliefs, and a few picky eaters, so we wanted to be able to accommodate the whole team, as well as everyone's budgets. Louis' is about $10-12 per small pizza. Louis' is a mom-and-pop, family restaurant type of place, with photos and children's drawings all over the walls, and booth seating. We were a group of 13 people and could only fit a maximum of six people per booth, but we all had our winter coats and spread out across three tables for more comfort.

Most of us ordered our own or decided on a few popular kinds to share. A small pizza is more than enough, so many of us left with leftovers, and some with entire pizzas for dinner. I ordered a small Louis' Special, with pepperoni, bacon, mushrooms, green peppers, and green olives. I was really craving a Hawaiian but still wanted the special, so I just added pineapple as well.

Because our group was large and the place was packed, it took us a little while to receive our orders, maybe about 15 minutes or so, but then again, we were starving when we walked in, so perhaps we were just impatient from the hunger. I'm not sure if they were having some special promotion or if it's always like this, but all of us who ordered small pizzas received them in a heart shape! The crust is regularly thick, which I generally don't prefer, but it was fresh and both crispy on the outside and soft on the inside - delicious. They can do a thin crust, but you have to ask. There were a ton of toppings on top and underneath the cheese, and even little mushroom halves stuck with a toothpick on each slice. No extra cheese needed, which I also typically order. Regardless of our individual preferences, we all left extremely full and satisfied.

There is a section off to the side that looked like a mini grocery/convenience store, but I mostly noticed the fridge full of pies that had a ridiculous amount of whipped cream on top. I was so full that I just couldn't have another bite, but I would love to go back and try a slice of pie."}
{"text":"There isn't a lot to say that hasn't already been said, however I want to add my vote for this being the best pizza in town. This isn't your thin crust, extra ordinary topping selection type of pizza, but on Saturday mornings when we had a few too many drinks the night before the only debate is which of us goes to Louis' to pick up the pie."}
{"text":"Undoubtably if you know Pizza in Ottawa you Know Louis'.  Recently while out of town with a bunch of people from across the Ottawa/Gatineau region we were sharing some quite good pizza together in a hotel room.  When the discussion of \"Best Pizza in Ottawa\" came up various names came up.  But when someone mentioned Louis'.  There was a dawning of consciousness and  almost everyone agreed that Lois' makes a fabulous pizza.

They don't fancy it up.  They don't have to.  But I can confirm that the secret is in the crust.  My wife NEVER finishes her crust.  But when I brought home Lois' this past weekend she ate the crust and complimented on how good it was."}
{"text":"Family orientated restaurant. Has won many awards for their pizzas. I have been going to Louis pizza since 1997 and every time its the same amazing taste. They have not changed their recipe I don't think. I love their dough, sauce and toppings. I have not had much of their menu because when I go there its for a good pizza. The restaurant itself is very small but cozy still. They have their famous jukebox that they play if its your birthday too along with a happy birthday Pizza...sometimes they will even surprise you with a heart shaped pizza. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Gotta disagree here. We came to Louis' via reco's by Yelp and our airbnb host, decided to go for pizza - we never eat pizza; carbs and fat and all. The interior is all booths, walls decorated with schoolkids' drawings, read: local, home crowd. We ordered a medium pizza, half ham and pineapple, half pepperoni with mushrooms and olives. Soft crust - their specialty. 
The pizza presented to us was unrecognizable- to us Americans anyway. Instead of crust-tomato sauce-cheese-toppings, this was crust-sauce-toppings-cheese. Instead of crisp pepperoni and olives on top, this was covered with a thick white moosh of cheese, the toppings buried inside. So the pepperoni was soft and floppy like Bologna in a sandwich. Likewise, the crust was too soft, maybe undercooked also. 
Maybe they do pizza different in Canada, hence the rave reviews. But we ate only half, took the other half home, and threw it out next day: it didn't improve overnite. 
The service was friendly and earnest and helpful. But to our tastes, the pizza was dreadful, the homemade blueberry pie a la mode only fair. The 1 star is for the service. Sorry."}
{"text":"Stop looking for better pizza! This is by far the best pizza in Ottawa, and what really sets them apart is their crust. I believe it's got some cornmeal in it and it adds so much flavour and deliciousness.

Don't be turned away from the decor, it hasn't been updated since it opened, but it adds to the charm of the place, and certainly doesn't take away from the taste of their menu. 

If you saved room for dessert, check out those cream pies in the display in the corner! Amazing!"}
{"text":"First time in this restaurant while in Ottawa for the weekend. I had the meat lovers pizza. Really good. Lots of gooey cheese, crisp bacon, ham, sausage and pepperoni. Crust is thick and tasty. Cooked just right. The Missus had a cheeseburger and fries. Also delicious.

Dessert was coconut cream pie made here and lemon meringue. Awesome.

Place was packed. Short wait. Well worth it.

Staff very attentive. Very busy. Friendly.

Another place to come back to."}
{"text":"Great place for affordable sit down to eat pizza. I've been going here for at least 10 years now. The decor is a bit of an 80's like diner but it adds a touch of personality. Mainly order just the pizza as that's what they're mostly known for. The thick crust and loads of toppings will make you drool. 

We will usually split a medium pizza and the price is just right. The usual staff are fun and friendly if you get to know them otherwise to an outsider they may seem like they're angry. This is a great hidden gem for those looking to get a good pizza in Ottawa."}
{"text":"I tried this pizza for the first time today.

The pros:
- Lots of cheese (on top of all the other toppings)
- Delicious, thick, crisp crust
- Lots of toppings (meats, veggies, etc)

The cons:
- The restaurant is nothing special; quite out-dated interior and doesn't catch your eye from the street
- Prices are a bit on the high side. Commenters below say this pizza is comparable to Milano's and Gabriel's, but those restaurants offer cheaper and better pizzas in my opinion
- There is a taste of cinnamon and curry in the tomato sauce. It's not very strong, but it's sweet enough that it resonates throughout every bite in every slice of pizza. This didn't seem to change between either the meat lover or the Hawaiian slices, and it was definitely coming from the sauce. Unfortunately this taste ruined the pizza for me, and outweighed the pros above."}
