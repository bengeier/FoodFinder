{"text":"45 minute wait for 2 items is ridiculous regardless of quality of food. Only five other cars in lot at time."}
{"text":"After hearing multiple locals say how great it was, I had to try it for myself! And I am SOOO glad I did! I was born and raised down south and this BBQ reminds me of home! Huge portions and greattt flavor! The owner was so very nice and personally took care of us! She even  let me try samples of the different sauces before we ordered. Very clean and friendly atmosphere, definitely the place to go if you're driving through or even a local! Thanks so much, you guys are awesome!"}
{"text":"I agree with every other good review. Easily the best BBQ in the Pittsburgh area. Not only is the service great but the food is spectacular and the portions are HUGE, literally. The prices can't be beat and I will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Really good food.  They cook their food over an indoor wood fed fire pit.  You get food that tastes like it came off of a campfire.  I've had hot dogs and lots of other things done over the fire.  I live less than half a mile away and the smells of the food cooking are awesome.  They make their own sauces which are out of this world.  The wait time can be a little long.  But it's worth it."}
{"text":"Food was not only good,but OMG the portions are huge!!!! The only thing that keeps me from giving 5 stars is the 10 min wait for them to run the credit card. Apparently, they have to share the main phone line with the credit card machine."}
{"text":"Yes, portions are huge. The ribs are country ribs and tough. Pulled pork has absolutely no flavor! It left a bad  aftertaste! Horrible sauces, tomato based."}
{"text":"There was absolutely no flavor to the food at all.  The meat tasted like it was boiled and had no seasoning whatsoever.  The reviews for this place were so great so we ordered a full rack of ribs, wings, and a porkchop.  We got takeout and when we got home, we were so disappointed.  Some of the ribs were tender and some were too hard to cut with a knife.  The sauce tasted like spicy ketchup...I don't get how other reviewers like it.  The wings and porkchop were cooked decently but again, no flavor at all.  Save your $40 and spend $12 on Giant Eagle Ribs instead. Sad, but true."}
{"text":"All time favorite BBQ. The sauce is so different and amazing. Sweet and tangy is to die for! My husband and I love coming here, and have tried just about everything, and it makes it so hard to choose what to get. Whether it's eating in, or take out we've always had a great experience. Our toddler son even loves it too. Cannot pass up the delicious cole slaw with dinner, and the fresh cut cheese fries. Now, every time my parents come for dinner we know what we're getting. Cannot wait for the next time we order!"}
{"text":"Had a delicious sampler with a chop and hot sausage,fries and slaw. Everything was suberb. Your sweet and spicy sauce is delicious. Lick the Styrofoam from all sides. New customer, a definite again."}
{"text":"Portions are ginormous. Plenty of meat on the chops. Not impressed with the ribs although they are huge. Wife said the pulled pork was \"alright\". BBQ sauce is tomato based, which we did not like. Fourth St BBQ is still my favorite in the Mon Valley!"}
{"text":"Is this place ever open? I Thought the 3rd time would be the charm. I made a 35 minute trip out to the Monongahela area today specifically to try the Rib Cage. Website and Facebook both said that starting 2/15 they would be open at 11 am. Well 2 PM and the doors were locked. Tried calling as well but no answer even though a car was in the lot and TV was on. Hard to give a fair review of the food if you never seem to be open. Sure do miss the days of Jeromes BBQ! Over to 4th Street I shall go next time I am in the area.  Sorry guys!"}
{"text":"If you don't like BBQ sauce that has a tomato paste base, then you will not like the BBQ here. It makes everything taste like its covered in slightly doctored up pizza sauce. Not a fan. I would easily give this place a  4, even 5 star review if they changed or just offered a different style of sauce."}
