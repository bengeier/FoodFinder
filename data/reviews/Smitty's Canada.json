{"text":"Very disappointing...  I had the Roast Beef Dip, they say it is piled high. Not even close, i am assuming that i got between 3 - 4 ounces of meat. I had more bun than i did beef. The amount of string fries were very disappointing also.  I most say the staff is very friendly.  In closing the value for this meal is not there."}
{"text":"Went here to the pub area for wing night!  The wings were decent! Service was very good!  The beer is cheap so in all its a typical smittys pub area with vlts, cheap beer and wings"}
{"text":"After waiting 15 minutes to be sat in the restaurant that was half full, we waited another 20 minutes for a server to come to our table with no luck. Walked out and went to Ricky's instead.  Difficult to taste the food when the front of house is useless."}
{"text":"I've eaten here for breakfast (often) and dinner (once).  What I can say?  Going for early breakfast is decent though not outstanding.  There's an early breakfast special (if you eat before 9am) that's worth the odd occasional trip.  But, it's dated, and regardless of which Smitty's I've been to, always seems to be a dark place that's been trapped in the 70's.  Phil's has that same feeling, but they have great big windows that let's in the light, and that difference in light can make all the difference.  Cool huge fishtank though that's worth a giggle for the kids.  As for dinner.... well... I'll just say that it was ok.  Yes, they do serve home style standards like meatloaf, burgers and the like, but again it really wasn't particularly inspired. Pricing if decent though, but again, the atmosphere really needs some sprucing up if they want to get a younger under 50 crowd.   If you're looking for home-style cooking with a kick, Diner Deluxe or Dairy Lane would be a better choice."}
