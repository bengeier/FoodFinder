{"text":"Really enjoyed -- fantastic wine recommended by server. By now this type of restaurant is not a new concept, but they pull it off well. Fun and delicious food with creative flavours. Got right in to sit at the bar without reservation at 7pm."}
{"text":"What an incredible experience! A few members of our wine sales team dined at farm for a little Christmas celebration. Service was outstanding, can't remember the young ladies name but she was absolutely brilliant and charming and took excellent care of our table. Food was equally as outstanding. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Terrible service last night. All employees including that Big manager were horse playing. Ignoring to take our drink and food order. This place is going down hill. We got up and left. We will not be coming back!"}
{"text":"I am very confused by the other reviewers of this restaurant. They must be employees of the Friday's located in this casino, employees of other nearby cafes and coffee shops, and are worried about the competition, or they are people who have no clue about what a coffee shop/cafe is. Let's be clear, this is a coffee shop/cafe and an excellent one! They have Burgers; a Petty Melt, Reuben, Club Sandwich, French Dip (Prime Rib Dip on their menu), Meatloaf, Fried Chicken, Country Fried Steak, Turkey Dinner, Liver and Onions and all the other usual suspects found on a coffee shop/cafe menu. They even have a \"proper\" chili cheese burger served open faced, which back in the day was only served open faced by every diner, cafe and coffee shop and called a \"Chili Size\". The food is very good, much better than any Denny's, IHOP or other cafe/coffee shop in the area. The prices are ridiculously low for a sit down coffee shop/cafe in this day and age, especially when you consider it is located inside a casino! When was the last time you saw a Deli Half Pound Sandwich, made with your choice of deli meat and bread, for $8 on a menu?  Until this restaurant opened I had to buy a whole corned beef, cook it myself, buy a whole bottle of Thousand Island dressing, a can of sauerkraut and purchase some Swiss cheese from the deli counter at my local grocery store to make a Reuben Sandwich as good as the one they make!  They have recently started serving breakfast 24 hours a day! A brilliant move! We have breakfast for dinner every Thursday night and at these low prices and extensive breakfast menu choices, we will be there on many Thursday nights.  This restaurant gets five stars from for being a perfect cafe/coffee shop. The only small complaint I have is that it is much too bright in the dining room. Will somebody please replace all those lights with lower watt bulbs or invest in some dimmer switches - LOL!"}
{"text":"We ordered the duck crostini appy, eggplant with mushrooms, and mac and cheese. All were extremely salty. They were kind enough to redo the eggplant which turned out fine, but not really tasty.  The service was attentive but waitress seemed frustrated that we said the food was salty. They took the eggplant off the bill; it was really nice. But after we paid she threw the receipt back on the counter; seemingly discontented.  We sat at the bar and looked at the chefs prepare other dishes which looked good, but we didn't want order anything else."}
{"text":"Great place, sad to see it close. The charcuterie plate was a lot of fun, and fortunately the cheese shop is still open. Still hoping Janice Beaton opens up another restaurant once the economy recovers."}
{"text":"Great place to go for breakfast, I've eaten here 5 or 6 times since June 2014, the food is always delicious.  I have tried French Toast with chocolate chips and banana, very fresh and delish; breakfast burrito, pancakes, Swiss and mushroom omelette and always with coffee and milk. The breakfast has always been good.  The service here is 50/50, I've gotten waited on by people who don't pay attention to my table and by a couple who have done a wonderful job waiting on me.  So, in conclusion, if you want a diner atmosphere with diner food, this is it! The service should be better since it is inside Aliante Hotel and casino......  I will eat here again though.  And the prices aren't terrible, they are reasonable."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday tonight and it was an amazing meal with my boyfriend!   Started with a Charcuterie board - got a soft and a hard cheese, and a wild boar pate thing. They were each paired with a little delicious extra item (onions, marinated apples, and jam) and it was GREAT!! So tasty.   We both had the special - a Bison short rib with scalloped potatoes, kale, and carrots. The meat was incredibly tender! My boyfriend usually dislikes any form of creamy potato but he liked these! The veggies were cooked perfectly.   For dessert we had the Peanut Butter Pot de Creme and the Macarons - all to die for!   The service was perfect. Really pleased :)"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. I come here weekly and the food is excellent. All fresh produce from local farms when available. I have eaten breakfest lunch and dinner here and can tell you it is above and beyond for the waitresses."}
{"text":"Some delicious dishes, but a warning about this place - it's very easy to walk away spending a little too much money for an unsatisfying meal.  Some entrees are quite small - not quite tapas sized, but smaller than typical. And maybe best avoid the tiny portions of the cheese and charcuterie board until you get familiar with the menu.  Order the right entree off the chalkboard, however, and a salad, and you'll find the food is pretty amazing."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago. So is my extended family. So we're used to good food, I suppose. We are also pretty sensitive to the value of a meal, my wife and I being new parents who don't get to get out much lately. Like, we want it to be WORTH IT when we lay down the cash and--more valuable to us--time to go out.  We ate at FARM last week (we were on vacation.)  Consensus is that FARM produced one of the best meals any of us has had. Especially considering the price.  I had sous-vide beef and it was so tender and flavorful that had to fight my toddler for every last bite. Giving her an initial taste was my fault. I learned my lesson.  We all fought over the cheese plate, too.  Three of us had desserts-- lavender panna-cotta, chocolate-peanut-butter pot-de-creme, and free-form cheesecake.. They immediately went to 1,2,and 3 on the leaderboard for desserts we have had in our lifetime.  Read this as if I took one half-star off for flighty wait staff.  Food, though, was incomparable. Really."}
{"text":"I've been to Farm before,....' at least a couple of times. 'Always good. Yesterday I arrived alone. 'Nice Malbec & I chose the crispy duck. Two yummy sized pieces on top of a slivered slaw with peanut sauce. 'Wonderful Chinese spices with the duck. 'The dark meat, succulent, not dry. I tried not to eat fast however it was so satisfying. 'Not cheap. $24. for the smaller new entree. I decided to have a French blue cheese for desert. It came with dried apricot and figs with a spray of honey. I was offered a half glass of wine. 'So nice as I was driving. The whole meal including the fragrant coffee at the end was  exquisite. 'Not inexpensive, 'with tip about $62. I came about 5:30PM, a nice time to arrive as the dinner crowd hasn't quite filled up the small restaurant. It was a sunny day, I enjoyed the slowly moving away sun from my window seat. The waitress was very nice. I will be back, 'again & again. Tuesday is always an awesome day to come because you get 3 courses for $30.  Monday is \"uncorked Monday\" & Wed. is Flight nite."}
{"text":"This food was horrible. Fancy cafe and horrible food to go with it. Waitress didn't even ask why I don't like my food but just said ok and left. This restaurant appears to be nice from outside but food and ingredients are very generic. Usually aliante is a good place so don't know why this cafe is so bad. Guess we will find somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, and I ordered the country fried steak & eggs off of their breakfast menu. The breading practically slid off of the steak, so a bit tough to cut through. And the potatoes were really greasy, but it was a filling plate, overall just too greasy for me. My friend got the country skillet, and that tasted a bit more comforting. My other friend got chicken & waffles and that was a nice combo (getting it next time). And my other friend got meatloaf, on the dry side, but not terrible. Just a reasonably priced food spot, any time of the day or night."}
{"text":"WARNING- if you are looking for a fresh and delicious meal, don't go to Farm. I'd give it 0 stars if I could. It was a disaster. We ordered the Belgium waffle with a side of bacon. Waffle was served with hard butter in those packets but the waffle wasn't hot enough to melt it. The bacon was way cold so I only ate a bit of that. My daughter ordered the eggs Benedict which came with country potatoes. The poached eggs were over cooked and the potatoes were the ones you buy from the freezer section of the grocery store.  If that wasn't bad enough, the service was even worse.  We got the food dropped off and then the next time we saw the waitress, it was to drop off the check.  No question of how the food was or anything.  She did have enough time to be laughing loudly with the other staff in the back though.  oh and by the way, they only had two other tables when we arrived and they were finishing up. Her loss because after all that I couldn't justify a tip. I'll never go back and predict they close up shop in the near future."}
{"text":"It was early dinner time when I visited.  Not very busy.  The server was very nice and attentive. But I was disappointed in the food.  I ordered the Ruben sandwich. The server came back and they had no rye bread.  I agreed sour dough would be fine. Corned Beef was good but the saurkraut had no flavor at all.  Disappointing overall."}
{"text":"This place is a complete farce. We had breakfast here and ordered the skillet w/ seasonal vegetables. When the dish arrived w/o any of the \"Farm Vegetables\" listed on the chalk board in the restaurant lobby, I asked what was going on. The answer:  \"That fresh vegetable list hasn't been changed in so long.\" The place is a complete fake. You're better off going to Denny's. At least they are honest about the crap food they serve."}
{"text":"This place is simply delicious! This is the kind of place where you could order anything and feel confident in the fact that it will be delicious. The servers were all very attentive and friendly and it was amazing to actually see my food being made!  I will most definately be going back."}
{"text":"Great cheese and deli meet plates. Really fun for lunch. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Great menu, friendly staff, plus the food is fresh and local which I love! I came here late night hungry for a beer and good food and was not disappointed! They have a great selection, I got the philly chz steak and a stella artois, thanks farm for satisfying my late night munchies!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and well prepared, creative food - everything I look for in a restaurant and at very reasonable prices for the quality. I took a good friend for a belated birthday dinner and we were both glad for the decision to try Farm. We shared a generous portion of a kale salad which was perfectly dressed. My friend had the crispy duck for her entree; it was the right combination of spicy and sweet. The duck itself was moist and tender. I had the special of the evening which was braised short ribs with quinoa. The ribs were perfectly cooked but I found the seasoning a little bland and one dimensional, which is the reason for only giving the restaurant 4 stars rather than 5. The service warrants its own compliment. Kudos to management and staff for providing a lovely evening from start to finish."}
{"text":"In town for business and tonight we decided to splurge a bit. This place is the real deal. Locally sourced and most things are made in-house. Farm reminds me of some haute cuisine found in Montreal or Vancouver. Definitely coming back next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Closed on a Monday night at 9:30pm. How can a 24/7 diner be closed so early? I understand that all restaurants have to clean their kitchen but still during dinner time? And the sign in front of the restaurant directed people to the Starbucks for food and beverages? Not exactly square meals at their suggested substitute."}
{"text":"Perfect! From the phone call when Mark helped me with a reservation, then Crista and Jill greeted us at entry, and Ryan served us in the Cheese Room: fantastic personnel and GREAT food and service. We couldn't make our reserved time slot due to husband's delayed flight but no matter: Crista and Jill treated us with such courtesy and empathy. Food was fantastic: we shared Mac n cheese, olives, pickerel fish, beets, and chai carrot cake. Fresh, tasty, beautifully prepared and plated. Our waiter Ryan could not have been more attentive, better at advising, and serving with a smile. If we lived here, FARM would be our favorite restaurant! Lovely! Please do this in Austin!"}
{"text":"I went for a late night breakfast with the Missus. I was greeted promptly by the servers up front, and seated immediately.   We were both a little taken back by the level of service. Even the manager stopped by for a quality check/visit during our meal.   We both thought our meals were quite good, and better than expected of a cafe in a local casino.   I'd recommend and would visit again."}
{"text":"We ended up at Farm after discovering the vegetarian place down the street was closed on Mondays. I'm Pescetarian(veg+fish). The menu at Farm seemed small, and they had limited options for me, but we went in anyway. My boyfriend, excited that he had escaped the vegetarian restaurant promptly ordered steak. I ordered the market salad and the Mac & Cheese. The salad with kale, feta, cranberries and pickled onion was really fresh and tasty and the Mac & Cheese was so rich and beyond amazing. We were less impressed with the steak however. It was a bit overcooked and tough. He enjoyed the accompanying vegetables more than the steak. Serves him right for complaining about having to eat vegetarian! Next time we'll take advantage of free corkage on Mondays."}
{"text":"Since Boyd Gaming took over the Farm has been awful on its table service. Twice this week seated and waited waited and waited.  Couple across the way got up to leave also.  Too bad food is pretty good if and when you get it."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Farm has the full package - great atmosphere, creative dishes and some of the best food I've had in Calgary. They also have a prime lcoation on 17th. I've had the soup, the mac and cheese (which is a crowd pleaser), and various daily specials- all were wonderful and creative culinary treats. I would also recommend to try out their wine pairings suggestions as I have been pleasantly surprised. The only downside is that they close for a few hours between lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I've been to Farm a few times, and hesitated writing this review, as I was waiting for the post-coital food bliss to wear off.  It hasn't. I'm still a fan.  The food... oh, the food. I could sing the praises of Nobel Farms duck breast with polenta, or the crispy perfection of the pork belly. And the pickles! MY GOD, THE PICKLES. I have dreams about those pickles.  I like the charcuterie, but I have to agree with Claire G - why aren't there more Canadian cheeses on the list? As well as on the wine list? Canada produces some fabulous wines, and with a place that tries to keep a local presence with it's food, you would think that would extend to the cheese and the wine? Minus one star for that.  I've always had consistently great service here, and the last server I had was a knowledgeable little pixie of a woman who knew her wine, and let us try a few different kinds before we went with her recommendations (like I said, she knew her wine!).   Farm never fails to please my tastebuds or my tummy, and I think another visit is long overdue!"}
{"text":"During a family reunion, we were suffering time zone issues and I was dying for breakfast at 3 in the afternoon. The Farm in Aliante was a perfect answer. The place is clean, bright and smelled like bacon - what more could one want in a breakfast joint? I had the Farm Skillet, two eggs on a hot skillet of fresh vegetables. Some of the produce is sourced from the local farm featured in the luscious, glossy photos of fruits and vegetables that adorn the walls. It was exactly what my tummy was craving. I would go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I love this hidden gem inside the Aliante casino! The food was amazing and everything was reasonably priced. I felt that they didn't skimp out on adding more ingredients to a dish to make it that much better. Their cheddar and bacon omelette is my favorite! There is plenty of bacon and cheese (I would say there is more bacon than egg). Then there is their pancake which is also amazing. I have been here a few times and have never been disappointed by the quality of the food. I just wish it was closer to my house!"}
{"text":"I had the soup and sandwich for lunch the other day, the soup was definitely a stand out. It was the daily special, turnip something. I know it doesn't sound great but trust me, it was. The atmosphere is so cozy and comfortable, I was having flashbacks of sitting in my grandma's kitchen where I used to go home to lunch from school everyday. The only thing I don't love is the parking but on 17Ave that's to be expected."}
{"text":"I've been to Farm twice and I'd love to go back again! From the food, to the service, to the design, this restaurant is unique and worthy of special note.   The restaurant was decorated in a vintage design with delicate teacups on the tables used for candleholders, lovely flowered wallpaper, and small crystal chandeliers. The restaurant was cozy so I'd suggest making a reservation.   The service was excellent and the very knowledgeable waitresses were helpful in suggesting meal choices depending the local products in season. This of course is a special feature of Farm, as the food is raised and grown on farms around Calgary.   I have tried the chicken, the trout, the duck and the mac and cheese. They were all delicious!  The charcuterie and cheese selection was a delicious way to start our meal. Meal-goers may select a variety of cheese and meats and then pair each selection with carefully matched accompaniments.    My personal favorite part of the meal was dessert. The chai carrot cake was very tasty and a creative alternative to regular carrot cake. The chai flavour was not overpowering and the vanilla bean goat cheese icing was absolutely delicious. The oven-fresh cookies are also AMAZING! Everybody devoured these warm from the oven chocolate chip cookies. They were almost better than my grandma's.   I plan on visiting Farm again for one of their event nights, like free corkage Monday or weekend brunch. But really, I don't need a special reason to visit this yummy restaurant."}
{"text":"Service was good. Food is no different than IHOP or Dennys. The salads are huge and tasty. On the teriyaki chicken with sauce on the side, the chicken was too dry to finish. It is 24 hours though which is a plus for the late night folks and need to fill their bellies.  Tried this place once but I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"Excellent variety of dishes, and especially cheeses.  I had a good lamb dish which was a tad dry but tasty.  i'll be back again with a group of 4-6 to sample a variety of dishes."}
{"text":"Now that I have experienced Farm, I will not eat anywhere else in Calgary. Great service,  foodgasmic flavour, comfortable environment.  Sat at the bar which is the best spot in the house for one or two people.  I wish I could give it more than five stars!!!"}
{"text":"We love this casino and just ate at the Farm.  The food is horrible.  The french fries looked like they came from the local high school and the burger looked like old meat loaf.   My wife took one bite and asked me to taste the burger; it was the most awful bite of any piece of meat I have ever tasted.  I think it was left over buffet meat that was given a cup of salt.      I am a horrible cook, but at least my burgers look like a hamburger patty.   The staff is awesome, but the quality of the food is real bad.   Either the chef is given bad product or he/she is really clueless.   I guess if you visit the Farm try the breakfast menu, it is hard to mess up an egg.   Bring some Tums if you order off the dinner menu."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant to be pretty average, if not a little boring. I got the rabbit gnocchi and a side of seasonal vegetables (parsnips). The meal was decent overall besides the two bones from the rabbit I had to pick out of my teeth. It was an interesting place but I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at some of the other reviews. I ordered scrambled eggs that were cooked perfect, cornbeef hash and potatoes. My daughter had pancakes and an English muffin. The service was decent but I could see it lacking if it were to get busy. I will return for another meal."}
{"text":"This place is our favourite. Great food and perfect service! I am sure, that we will visit Farm again! :)"}
{"text":"OK I'll just say it - I'm in Love. I could eat here everyday, all day, 365, 24/7.  It's the best place I've been for lunch in a mighty long time. The charcuterie, the salad, the cider and oh yes - the wonderfully sinful peanut butter pot eau creme - and yes it was -  I ate the whole damn thing outstanding. After three hours and as many pots of coffee I regretfully said adieu.   So why only the 4 stars? Well there's just one thing that got in the way of a truly heavenly experience- $12 for a pot of coffee - french press coffee - not even fancy coffee. FARM you know this is Canada right?  I've had cheaper coffee in Paris. So what up with break the bank coffee? It's very hard for girls to talk over a glass of water. Think about it.  But I'll be back and soon and often."}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about the place. My parents always stay here when visiting and will get break fast here each day. The food is certainly better than IHOP or Denny's but has the same casual feel. I was very surprised by the quality, attentive service honestly.   My father loves the fried shrimp, wife loves the fish and chips and I've had the above average philly cheese steak and quite good t bone. The steak was a little tough but cooked perfectly to my request. Yeah -- definitely not a Denny's. And an often overlooked item that really adds to the meal....their French fries seem fresh and seasoned well - great flavor.  Oh and the cookies? Listen to everyone else. They are awesome, and better than the $7 offerings I've had at some places in town."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, short but delicious menu. Great service and free corkage on Mondays. What's not to love!!"}
{"text":"Farm is the new restaurant opened by Janice Beaton, of cheese shop fame.  Farm has a very limited menu with excellent mac n cheese, grilled cheese and other items.  The best part, however, is the cheese/meat/condiment tasting.  You choose several items (meats or cheeses) from the \"cutting board\" menu and they bring them out with condiments to go with them.  They also have an excellent sommelier to recommend wines to go with.  Farm has the additional distinction of being reasonably priced, a rarity among new Calgary restaurants."}
{"text":"- Wowie - After a follow-up review of a surprisingly bad experience I had at Farm, Angie from Farm sent a comment to clarify a few things (and I'll assume it's on here somewhere... and if not, it does very correctly point out that the $100/person I referenced was for 5 tasting courses of green salad, meat and cheese plate, crustini and spreads, Mac&Cheese and cookies for (according to Angie) $35/person (I thought the food part was more like $45/person but I'll defer on this point... cuddos to Angie for responding (although it would have been better to have seen this level of service during my event...).  I'll stand by my review on that particular experience and my direct response to her is included below  ______________________  Angie,   Don't get me wrong, I actually still am a fan of Farm (kinda). The food was good and sure, there was wine and gratuity and tax and everything else that goes into $100/person. Service though (for whatever reason... and as a patron entertaining clients I frankly don't care what the reason might have been) was horribly slow and inattentive (which, in the context, surprised me and embarrassed me with my clients). I still like your restaurant and your concept but you've lost my trust and I will think very hard before I host something important at Farm or provide any recommendation to my colleagues or others (at least in the context of anything approaching a larger group)."}
{"text":"FARM is where the PANCAKE HOUSE used to be located. I love Aliante and having a 24hr coffee shop is a very nice addition. I had the country fried steak and eggs and it was delicious. Their menu is diverse and priced just right. The service was awesome, very attentive servers. The decor is a little plain but it is nice and clean. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was very happy with the country fried steak I had this morning for breakfast.  They have a special way of cooking scrambled eggs that makes them very smooth and fluffy, I loved it!  The whole meal was very well prepared and I look forward to returning on a regular basis.  I saw some steaks come out to an adjoining table and they were huge and the people raved about them, so that's next!  My only complaint was the service seemed a little slow but all the wait staff kept asking how I was doing, they were trying very hard but it seemed like a place that had just opened and everyone was trying to find they footing.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have a very intimate relationship with food and I explore resteraunts all over BC and AB and this is by far one the best places I've eaten! I'm there at least 3-4 times a month. They have a chabby chique charm (so you can go in dressed casually or you can dress up). It's a small venue but intimate and the food is fantastic - very flavorful."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place. Loved. It is everything that food and service are supposed to be.  We were part of a group of 8 that tried out Farm on a Saturday night for dinner. The place was busy with a combination of walk ins and people with reservations (as the night went on it looked like it was difficult to get a table without a reservation).  Our server was fantastic-she was more than a server. She knew the menu inside and out and spoke passionately about the cooking techniques, the ingredients and her personal favourites. She took time to make sure she answered any questions (we had a lot) and never made us feel as high maintenance as I am sure we were being. It was clear she was as in love with the food as I was about to become.  My partner and I spilit a 3 itm cheese board to start while another portion of our group had the 5 item board (meats and cheese). Our cheese and their pairings (walnuts, picked cheeries/onions) were amazing. I'm a bit of a cheese lover- (I have two casts who are named after cheeses) and this did not disappoint. The prices weren't cheap but I think they were worth the quality of the cheese presented.  Our party had a range of entree items from the mac and cheese (to die for), the flat iron steak (OMG so good) to crispy pork (OMG so good) to trout. Their menus are seasonal based on local (or near local) ingredients so it will shift from time to time. They also had a \"Quebec week\" theme going on so one of our group had homemade tortiere. It looked delicious. The prices were reasonable as were the portions.  We still had a little room for dessert (well some of us did). I am not really a dessert person but wow. I had a special featured dessert (bread pudding with a maple crispy bacon topping) and my boyfriend had a peanut butter and chocolate dessert that was to die for. The presentation was awesome.  I would definitely go back. It's not often you find a place with such great attention to detail, delicious food, reasonable prices and wonderful service."}
{"text":"I never post reviews. I work in a resort in the service industry and I know how difficult it is to serve the public but this was by far the worst experience I've ever had.  It was embarrassing for the establishment and I was shocked that this kind of service was even tolerated on any level within a property. We were a party of two, arrived at 11:30 am on a Thursday morning. It was not busy at all. I was told, along with another party of 5 that it would be a 15 min wait. We had no problems waiting but was confused being that there were very few other people in the dining room and ample seats available. Seemed as though there were plenty of servers and staff standing around as well. Once seated, it was another 15 min before our server appeared. We ordered drinks and food. An HOUR passed when our server finally came to say that the kitchen was slow. Still no food. Right before we were about to leave another server dropped our food off without a word. I had chicken tenders that were incredibly dry and turned to saw dust in my mouth. I could not even eat them. However, I was so hungry at that point that I only ate my fries. I couldn't get out of there fast enough. I just wanted this experience to be over! When asked how was everything at the register, I tried to respond with a sense of compassion, knowing things sometimes go wrong. I told her discreetly just a few of the issues we encountered. She just smirked and showed me where to sign my check. Totally disgusted with her lack of sincerity nor any attempt of any kind of an apology, I started to leave and noticed another member of the staff engaging with an elderly woman with a walker who was obviously hard of hearing. The woman was asking a question about the menu and the hostess was smug, belittling and abusive. This was so inappropriate and upsetting! We finally left feeling defeated and irritated after wasting two and a half hours of our time there. Don't even bother with this place! We won't be back."}
{"text":"So my friend and I last night sat down and waited 15 minutes before no one asked us if we needed anything. There was 3 servers and only 2 tables so they did not have an excuse of being to busy. We got up and left."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food, service and decor. The one warning I would give to anyone heading down is to make a reservation as they had very limited seating. Well worth the wait either way."}
{"text":"My first visit was an unplanned lunch and I hadn't known Janice Beaton had expanded into the restaurant business.  Had the daily soup and burger.  The soup was mushroom with bacon bits and I think beans.  Opted to add bacon to the burger as well.  Despite what others have said here the food is NOT overly salty. The soup was in a cup served with the burger plate. Smooth, flavourful, approaching careful homemade quality level.  The burger had a crusty fresh bun, a juicy medium cooked patty, lean but not at all dry, little bits of onion, bacon, shaved ham, strong melted cheese, big leafy fresh spinach, a homemade garlic pickle and a nice creamy vinaigrette.  I said it was the best burger I ever had and even now I still mean it.  So if you're one of those vegans or picky types that finds the sight and smell of meat traumatic, don't come here.  It's not for you.  But if you like hearty fare done with skill, in a place that is noisy, not silent like a monastery, you'll love it.  The only reason I didn't give five stars was I have to come back here a lot and try everything."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Was seated very quickly just after lunch rush hour.    I had the beef burger and my wife had the chicken burger.  FARM Burger Silver Sage beef, aged cheddar, butterleaf lettuce, onion jam, local tomatoes, back bacon and FARM sauce   The beef and bun were delicious.  The beef paddy was cooked perfectly. The meal should have been brought to the table as soon as it was finished in the kitchen.  It was not as hot as it should have been. The potato soup that came as a side was very tasty, however it was lukewarm.  It would have been much better if it had been hot.  The chicken burger with gluten free bun was also very tasty.  Weakest point in this meal was that both meals were not very hot.  Tasty though.  The staff needs to make sure that the meals get to the tables while it is still hot."}
{"text":"What a great concept of mostly local foods. There are few few nondairy no wheat meals to choose from."}
{"text":"I have been to Farm several times and have had a good experience each visit.  The food is great.  The menu is small, but there are enough options and the quality is excellent.  Farm has an excellent wine menu and the servers make great recommendations.  The ambiance in the restaurant is casual and comfortable and my husband and I generally sit at the bar.  Overall, it is a great restaurant.  I highly recommend making reservations in advance if you want to sit at a table."}
{"text":"Came here twice because were staying in the hotel. We will not be coming back. Service is slow because there's not enough staff apparently although the staff is pleasant. Yesterday and today I ordered the same thing, bagel and lox which comes with an egg (not on the menu). Yesterday I ordered just the egg whites, simple. But today the head chef Shawn tells our waitress to charge us $1 for the special order. Yesterday the cream cheese didn't come with my meal, had to ask for it and we had to ask three times for a to-go box. Hash browns were really salty."}
{"text":"I love pleasant surprises. Who knew, being the city dweller I am, that I would be so taken with a restaurant called Farm. Farm's approach to cuisine is progressive in that it melds some traditional favourites by using local suppliers. The results are fantastic, fun and uniquely Albertan.  For starters we had some great wine and cheese. We went with the La Ferme ($11/Glass) with followed by several cheeses (3 cheeses for $15) we asked our server to select based on the wine. Since I had such great company I'm afraid the actual names of the cheeses escapes me. I do know that the star of the trio was the dutch cheese the served to us with almonds. Very tasty, not too rich not too light!  For dinner we had the Sabblefish ($23) with the Wild Boar Porchetta ($23). Both were excellent in their own ways. The Sabblefish was good, but the squash mix below the fish is what I really remember. I felt it was a perfect base for a fall dish. The Porchetta was insanely excellent. I swear I could taste the character of the oven with every bite.   We finished with a flour-less chocolate cake topped with apples and whipped cream ($7). It was great, but I think the apples were a bit too much. The cake itself was perfect adding apples complicated the flavour slightly.   The service was excellent. The server was well versed in the food and was able to know which cheeses to choose to go with our wine.   I think Farm has become one of my favourite restaurants. It is pricey though. Were it not for the price, I'd be there every week.  27/30 Yelp 30 Day Challenge"}
{"text":"This places started out a little shaky. We had a waitress with major attitude when we got there. Everyone with me felt the vibe she was giving. We went ahead and ignored it and just hoped the food would overcome her. I ordered steak and eggs as the steak did not have much flavor. I found myself adding some salt and pepper once i was eating it. Surprisingly the waitress showed up while we were eating in a better mood. Not sure what the whole deal was to begin with. Regardless the food was mediocre, pricing is not bad but not sure if I'm willing to go back for bland steak and mediocre service."}
{"text":"7:09am quick seating us & immediate to order.  Great variety of breakfast skillets, create your own omelette, lox & opened 24/7.  Awesome thing about living in Vegas.  If you can't find a place for whatever time you're hungry, you can rest assure the casino will have one.  Great coffee.  I ordered two eggs over medium, wheat toast & turkey bacon.  Mom ordered the corn-beef hash w/ eggs over-medium.  Both excellent.  Service absolutely fantastic!  Thank you to the host, Lily, the girl who brought out food out, efficient chef & our server, Evelyn.  Thanks also for the military discount since dad is a retired veteran!"}
{"text":"Could've sworn I wrote a review about this place but anyways I'll start by saying this is one of my favorite local spots to come to! Staff is always friendly and helpful, it's always clean inside and the food is pretty good for the price! Good place for locals or tourists come check it out!"}
{"text":"Went back here and the portions were larger, the food was still great.  One of my favorites in Calgary."}
{"text":"Service: they were attentive and focused on us the entire time. Also, they did something I have never seen at a restaurant: they brought my daughter her food first. We have a one year old, and she was getting a bit fussy as we waiting for dinner. But, to our surprise, they brought her food out, served it, and said, \"we hope this keeps the little one happy. Your food will be out shortly.\" My kid started to happily eat her chicken while the wife's and I were able to continue out conversation.  It was a great surprise. Or service was equally impressive.   Food: Classic comfort food. Filling, messy, and just what we wanted. The wet fries were good, but filing for two people.   Atmosphere: some smoke seeped in from the casino floor, but it was not too noticeable. And it is really bright inside. White walls and bright lights. Ouch. Not that we aced too much, since we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I don't even want to put 1 star! The hostess sat us immediately,  no waiter or waitress ever came after 10 minutes. We left!"}
{"text":"A-ok for now. When I went it was almost empty in the place so we were seated right away. The sever came and though I appreciate her being friendly towards my daughter and humoring the Tinker Bell talk, I was secretly wishing they would wrap it up already because I was super hungry haha.   We all ordered sandwiches, turkey club w/fries, crispy chicken w/onion strings and a kid's grilled cheese w/fries. I only tasted the turkey club and it was very good (can't really mess up a turkey club, at least I hope not). My daughter took only one bite if her grilled cheese but she never eats in general because of how picky she is. My dad said he liked the crispy chicken and he loved that it came out hot.   They only thing that made me wonder....we were literally one of the three small groups of people sitting in there. If the place were busy I would understand why our server was hardly to be seen. She checked on us once right after we got our food (of course when my mouth is full) and then we didn't see her again until she FINALLY came with the check.   One small thing to add...She never offered us a refill on our drinks, what if I was dehydrated..."}
{"text":"I stopped into Farm on a whim.  I had an appointment downtown that ended early and was less than a block away.  Perfect!  I took a seat at the bar, which is perfect for solo dining.  My waitress was awesome.  Super knowledgable and friendly, she gave me a quick overview of the most popular items on the menu.  I decided to go with the veggie burger special with bleu cheese and a salad.  It was DIVINE.  Like the best veggie burger I have ever had....maybe the best burger I've ever had.  YUM!  All the parts were top notch and it came together wonderfully.    I will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Great experience. Had a special on for free range chicken pot pie. Followed that up with a 3 cheese plate (with accompaniments chosen by chefs for each). The bartender who served us was knowledgable and friendly. I wish I was into cheese more, but the overall experience was great."}
{"text":"This place has been recommended to me by a number of ppl. I travel solo to Calgary for work, and am always in search for a comfy place one person can have a decent meal. I ordered the 'chicken gritz' dish, which was phenomenal. Comes with 3 delicious sauces, mash, bourbon maple. Great ambiance where you're Able to watch the chefs at work."}
{"text":"The food here is great...except for late night. The only reason I'm giving 1 star. I was told that they couldn't honor a grilled cheese sandwich anymore for late night cooking because the chefs \"couldn't handle it because it wasn't on the menu.\" Seriously!? It's two pieces of bread with some cheese and tomato. Really?? Can't handle it? I've stopped eating here late night after gambling because of this. You used to have my business every week but ever since the \"manager said\" they can't do this anymore I refuse to order food from you. You've lost mine and my friends' business and won't get it back until you realize a grilled cheese sandwich isn't that difficult to make and should be on a late night menu or not refused to regulars."}
{"text":"I think I've been in the door at my place for 3 minutes. Came straight back from Farm. Correction; Farm and CHRISTA. OK, let's set the scene: It's April 16/2011 another stupefying, mid winter's day... yah, you read that right. An additional slap in the chops from Winter. The last two years we've had two seasons. Winter and the last week of August. Now, I've been to Farm on a number of occasions, and was always pleasantly surprised. EVERYTHING is so, beautifully presented, and it tastes like nobody's business. Today they just launched a new Brunch Menu. Tragically, they've decided to have someone well versed in Creative Writing  detail everything on the Menu. It reads like a New York Times Art Review. OK? So try to decide. Just try.  Enter: CHRISTA. Imagine Julia Roberts giving it 400% while working your table like U2 does Wembley Stadium.. Incredibly engaging, involving, attentive and friend-ly, friendly... friendly. She's a master at the art of l-i-s-t-e-n-i-n-g. You can get a meal anywhere you go, a meal like you get at FARM is a one in ten, but you load that with French Press Coffee and the single finest service I've ever had in my entire life, (*my lady-pal completely concurred), and they had to pull me out of there with a heavy lifter.  The food was superb and so enjoyable on such a dog-fornication day, we said no way, this just ain't gonna; end.... So? With a Rebel Yell? We cried Mo', Mo, MO-O-O! On to the Cheeses. Don't even ATTEMPT to navigate these. Just indicate some interest and allow Cap'n Christa to navigate you safely to shore. Christa? ORDER for us. Christa? Pick a wine! Keener than an Army Sharpshooter she kept knocking them down, one by one. All with pinpoint accuracy. 2 Hours later? We had NO choice but to head home in our two separate directions. How the Hell can you top that? We both tipped like fiends, walked out the door and started thinking, Geebuz.... what just happened in there?  Food: Exceptional Service: Always been a cut above until today. Christa elevated it from a meal into an EVENT. An EXPERIENCE. Gawd luv ya' girl. We're humbled."}
{"text":"This is a disgrace to yelp! Yelp snobbery at its finest! This is a good if not great casino cafe, and anyone who says otherwise is disingenuous. The food is delicious and prepared well, the use of local produce should be applauded! This is casual casino cheap cafe at its best, wth is with the 1 & 2 star garbage?"}
{"text":"I'm a local and I've been wanting to eat here for a while but I never made it to the table before we walked out.  The hostess was such a rude bitch and seemed like she had no idea what she was doing.  After waiting in line to be seated with several other parties also waiting, we watched her move aimlessly around a nearly empty restaurant for 10-15 minutes where she then decided to start bussing a table. As she emerged from the kitchen with a stack of menus in hand, and stomped over to the reception area and slammed down the menus on the counter.  She then shouted, \"Listen up!  There's going to be a wait!\"  One couple were talking to each other and Miss Congeniality shouts, \"EXCUSE ME!  I said there's going to be a wait!\" Everyone in line left except for the people that were next to be seated. Don't know how the food is but I will never know because I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Simply amazing. From the home made pickles and (truly great) home made ketchup to the mind blowing dinners and the ONLY Mac n' Cheeze I would ever order in a restaurant, this place never ceases to amaze me."}
{"text":"I like Farm and I'd go again. It's sort of like Salt in Vancouver but with more food options.   The thing that sucks about Farm is that the decor is a bit too girly. It's a nice place to go for lunch with the ladies on the weekend, or I'd go there with my mom. I'd never take a date there though. Salt in Vancouver is cooler in that regard, and seems to appeal to a broader cross section of individuals.   Maybe it's time for some redecoration? Loose the doilies."}
{"text":"The food is good. I had the ham steak breakfast. The ham steak was big! The prices are reasonable another plus, but the service is seriously lacking. If you don't mind bad service you can get a good meal."}
{"text":"I commend Katie at the Farm.  She is such a sweet waitress and is very personable and connected with her guests.  I hope Management will recognize Katie!  Well done and we will keep coming back as long as she's there!  This is our neighborhood hangout!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight for dinner. The service was completely horrible. The staff were completely disinterested in us and once the waiter took our order we never saw him again. The food was lifeless and my potato was a hockey puck. I do not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Pets over their human customers. Food is great! so great that we been back more than once, and I have recommended this place to numerous people. I work at a very well known Medical Company here in the valley, and see 100's of patients on a daily basis. I recommend people to this place all the time, and they actually go and love the food. However, after tonight I will not be returning to Farm. Two ladies walked in with two dogs. One in a stroller and one on a leash. These dogs were NOT service dogs, therefore should not have been in a food establishment. It was rude of the owners to think this was ok. Some people are highly allergic to dogs and would like very much to be able to go out for dinner without having to worry about having an allergic reaction. These dogs were not well behaved either. They were barking like crazy. The thing that really pissed me off, was that the manager walked by a few times, and did NOTHING about it. Remember, People bring in revenue, NOT dogs. You should do everything possible to make sure people are comfortable and taken care of at your place. In this economy places do not always last. If people feel uncomfortable, they will NOT return and will NOT recommend your place to anyone. I am so disappointed because this is one place in Vegas that has great food, and I  love their concept of using ingredients from local farms. Too bad they put pets above people."}
{"text":"Bad food and below average service.  Don't bother with this place.  We have been several times and it's getting worse not better."}
{"text":"Place looked appealing from the outside - Everyone was friendly - Service was fair - Food not the best - Seems like you get a lot of food but flavor was not there - Very Blah! - I'm not sure what to think about this place - May try it again but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"We had the \"price fixe\", three courses for $30, which this night included a salmon entree which was wonderfully cooked and delicious. Along with the glass of chardonnay recommended by the host it was a great meal. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Generally not a complainer but only giving 2 stars for the waitress who was very apologetic...as well as comping a meal.   Second time eating here first time was for dinner. .service was verrrry slow then.   The first experience I blew off.  Today though strike 2, we had an 11 am movie. We arrived a few min after 10 am plenty of time...we thought.   Waitress took our order in a timely fashion it was getting our meal that there was an issue.  My meal came first minus the potatoes...they corrected.   My husband's meal didn't show up until I was just about done eating.  He ordered a breakfast sandwich.  Not sure what was going on in the back but the sandwich finally came only after we said we had to leave in 5 min. My husband's sandwich literally looked tossed together.  The waitress mentioned she had to stand over the cook.  Then something about the cook not knowing how to cook eggs.  ??? Needless to say we won't be going back."}
{"text":"The food is decent.  I would never ever recommend This place. They have lots of servers but they are not organized. They don't even seem to know what tables they have. P"}
{"text":"meat + cheese + wine = awesome  it was quebec week when our party of 6 arrived at Farm on a friday night. coincidentally, 3 out of our 6, were from quebec... and so we had a great evening.  charcuterie platter - come on. who is going to say no when you pair up beautiful cuts of local and quebec meats (saucisson was great!!) with an assortment of wonderful cheeses. we ended up getting the \"cutting board\" which allowed us to mix and match 5 types of meats, and 5 types of cheeses for $50.   poutine - an homage to the belle province. dang. this was tasty.  wild boar braised shoulder - i didnt need a knife. nuff said.  this place is a sign that the taste buds of calgary are starting to change, and what a great change it is."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came for dinner on a Wednesday night. I'd been to Janice Beaton before and so I was excited to try Farm.   We picked five cheeses to start which was a great decision - generous portions (cheese plates can often be stingy) with great jam & sauce pairings. I had the special - bison short ribs - which came with the most delicious chèvre polenta I've ever had in my life. My boyfriend had the boar belly which had a nice Korean-style sauce. It was a bit salty for my taste but he loved it so what do I know! We also had a side of beats which were cooked with walnuts and (I think) sage.  For dessert my boyfriend had a piece of chai carrot cake which he loved. I was stuffed but ordered one  raspberry hibiscus macaron which was the perfect way to end the meal (only wafer thin, after all).   There was a wine flight on special (every Wednesday, apparently) which is always fun. Our server was attentive and fun - it was a slow night and we ended up chatting with him for a while about Game of Thrones. Great spot, we'll definitely be back! Oh, and a reservation a few days ahead is probably a good call."}
{"text":"The mains were rabbit and chicken.  The rabbit was extremely moist and tender with a beautiful flavour.  The chicken was ever so slightly overcooked but still really tasty.  The vegetables with both dishes are simply amazing.  All the ingredients clearly are super high quality and really fresh.  Service was outstanding considering how busy the restaurant was.  The waiter made a really good wine recommendation.  The only downside is that the noise level is extremely high."}
{"text":"Locally grown yummy food. The philly cheese steak sandwhich with a side of ranch is great. The tea is just right not to strong and not to weak. They are twenty four hours but wont server lunch stuff until after 6am.  The prices are great too."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, I was having one for those weeks where I just wanted to hide in my room and not face the myriad of people in my life because I was just plain tired and pissed off. But I was a grown up, and I had responsibilities, i.e. go to work, be responsible, etc. So I called my girlfriend and sweet-talked her into ditching her personal training plans at the gym so she could instead go have dinner with me 'at a nice quiet place so we can talk and relax'. I decided to try Farm, because a place with a name like that is not likely to be loud and ostentatious - two things I was not in the mood for.   When we arrived, we immediately took a liking to the place. It was small, quiet and conversational. The host took our coats (yay!) and told us there is only room at the bar. We didnt mind. Anyway, it was a Tuesday, so that meant a 3 course meal for $30 bucks. We indulged. Our first course was a tasty arugula salad with pecans and blue cheese. Our second course was a beef steak-type dish which was cooked perfectly. It was a small-ish portion, but we really liked it. Our dessert course was a homemade ooey-gooey raisin-cinnamon bun. It was pretty big too! We finished the entire thing and then couldnt believe how full we were! The entire meal was so good, and the entire time we talked, laughed and caught up.   Farm is the *perfect* place if you want to just relax and have a good conversation while being served great food. The service was great and unintrusive.    27/30"}
{"text":"My favorite place to have lunch. My one concern is that the chef made a meatloaf one day but hadn't noted on the  board that it was pork. I'm not a huge fan of pork aside from bacon. That aside, everything else I've had here is fantastic, the soup is made fresh daily and the mac and cheeze is to die for."}
{"text":"An unsuspecting favorite.  I've gone to many restaurants and cafes in casinos and this is by far the best.  I look forward to eating here rather than most places you settle for.  I highly recommend you try this place;  food portions, price and quality are all well worth it.  Personal favorites are the chicken tenders, chicken quesadilla and the Ruben sandwich."}
{"text":"This is just an average cafe. We ordered fish and chips, fried chicken and a Belgian waffle. Everything was just ok. Not bad; not good. I do commend them for serving up fresh, fried chicken and not pre-fried frozen Banquet chicken like a lot of other places in Vegas. The prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Pretty yummy food and excellent service. The croissant French toast was really good and the servings are huge!"}
{"text":"This place is probably the worst customer service I experienced. We sat down and 10 min. Later someone ask if we wanted something to drink. They were not even busy. Me and my wife ordered appetizers and we got the chicken wings when the waitress brought the appetizer we asked for small plates it never came. We finally got our main course and my wife ordered a steak medium they cooked it so well done my wife couldn't even cut it with a knife. I was afraid what might happen if we complained but my wife did anyway. The waitress seem to have a slight attitude. When the steak came back the waitress ask my wife to cut it to see if it was ok. We asked for napkins and it took awhile. Waitress took a long time to check if we needed drinks or anything."}
{"text":"We went on opening day. The service was slow and we had to wait for a long time for drink refills. The grilled tuna sand which was served on rye bread and the turkey dinner was served with no dressing or cranberries. I asked for the manager and was  that they would fix the sandwich but they were out of dressing and cranberries. I thought they would give me a discount of some kind, but they refused. I will not be back."}
{"text":"This is a diner located inside of the Aliante Casino in North Las Vegas. My wife and I went in on a Tuesday around 6PM and were seated immediately. The server was very nice, took our drink order, and service was spot on throughout the entire meal. No complaints at all.  The food is what one would expect from a diner and the prices are extremely reasonable. The restaurant is clean and inviting with a \"Rural Farm\" feel, which is in line with their brand.   I had the pot roast and it tasted like my mom used to make it- A little too heavy with the gravy mix, but the beef, potatoes, and vegies were cooked well and I enjoyed it. My wife had the Turkey sandwich with a side of potato salad and she said they were both really good.  All in all, Dinner for two for just over $20.00, I have no complaints and we will come back."}
{"text":"Horrible wait staff, food and experience. Rude waitress tossing silverware and cups on the table grunting and groaning and grudgingly taking our order. Then the food tasted awful including eggshells in my scrambled eggs that tasted AWFUL to begin with. I will never go back."}
{"text":"After reading in the paper that FARM had great mac and cheese I decided to go and try it for myself.  Got it to go, it was nothing special, but the portion sizing was good and it tasted good, maybe next time I'll try it fresh with the pork shoulder :) FARM smells wonderful though I have to say I love the smell of the restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife and I saw the $4.00 lunch specials. We went out of our way to go to there. We were seated immediately. We had a fantastic waiter. The lunch specials are tasty, although you will not be stuffed. I am giving ONE star because they charge you for EACH glass you drink of soda or tea, I consider this gouging in today's day and age."}
{"text":"Fish and chips was excellent. Crispy outside tender inside. 3.99 5oz burger was equally satisfying, very juicy burger."}
{"text":"Watching the cooks prepare the food in front of me while sitting at the bar made me never want to eat here again.  Watching the french toast being made, having the whipping cream fall over and watching a cook use her fingers to scoop it back up made me want to gag... and that dirty dish rag you are wiping your fingers on? Easiest way to spread bacteria, especially when touching meat *wiping* touching salad *wiping*   So, overall not impressed. The service was great even though it was busy, we were well taken care of, but I can't see myself ever going back after seeing them cook."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I found ourselves in 17th Avenue.   We were close by and they had good reviews, so we decided to stop in. The decor is minimalist but sufficient to make a warm, welcoming environment. The menu was small,  (always a good sign,)  but it included a couple vegetarian items.   My fiancé is a vegetarian, so this was critical.     She had been the Mac and cheese, and was certainly dazzled by it.   I  had a bite too, and I'm sure it's the best I've tasted.   She also got a vegetable side.   They were deliciously seasoned and arrived in a pesto sauce.   Haute cuisine, and I don't hesitate to call it such despite its reasonable price, should in all but the rarest circumstances be sauced under the feature.   When my chicken and grits arrived, it was both a visual and gustatory delicacy.   It was plated so well that I almost felt guilty eating it.. Almost.  The two sauces complimented everything on the plate perfectly.   The grits were hidden under a farm fresh slaw with what I think may have been a red wine vinegar.   This too was balanced incredibly well.   We could not pass up dessert here, having been blown away by how well executed their mains were.  We shared a half dozen oven fresh cookies, a peanut butter and chocolates pot de creme,  which my fiance loved, though she usually doesn't like peanut butter at all.  We also had a slice of carrot cake that Lord Brio saveron (sp? ) himself would have made if such existed in his time.   It tantalized or taste buds, and had a wonderful north feel.   It had ton of dimension too.   In a word,  fantastic!"}
{"text":"I found the food alright, but not great.  I came here for lunch and found the menu very limited. I had a sandwich and although the ingredients tasted very fresh I found my meal quite bland.  Not sure if I'll come here again anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times now for breakfast and lunch and I have to say I do like the food.  The prices are reasonable and the service is usually good.  My favorite is the bacon omelet with a side of chili.  I have also tried the French Dip sandwich and Pastrami sandwich both which were really good."}
{"text":"Can't recall how many times we have been here but we are always happy.  Quick and friendly service and good food."}
{"text":"Love the concept of this easy going community of growers working together. The servers are friendly, have great suggestions for the cheeses & charcuterie board and the pairing went so nicely together. For lunch we had the ooey gooey mac & cheese...YUM! Definitely go back and try the other menu items we didn't have time or room for, like dessert!!!"}
{"text":"Food is well prepapred and tasty. Service is good and attentive. Cocktails are delicious. Beer selection good as well."}
{"text":"The food here is hit and miss. Certain items are good but majority are bad, very very bad. I have been here many times due to the dining credits the casino gives out monthly.   The Good: pancakes are delicious, crispy chicken sandwich decent, grilled salmon is pretty good, breakfast skillets are ok, and cookies are awesome when fresh.  The bad: anything with grilled chicken over cooked and very dry, any type of grilled sandwich bread over cooked to the point where your upper mouth gets damaged with every bite, turkey has no flavor, any type of steak very low quality beef and way too chewy, omelettes are not soft and fluffy, country fried steak is just nasty.  That is just a few things that I could think of. I think the combination of poor quality ingredients and cooks that take no pride in what they do are what make this place so so bad. Besides the food the restaurant is very nice and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"My friends and I come here all the time after bingo.. You can't beat the $4 lunch special. You get a cup of soup and a half of a sandwich. The reason why I only gave 3 stars is because their time in getting you in and out is terrible. One time it took them over 30 mins to bring us our food. I also tried the eggs Benedict here once and it was terrible. The muffin was literally hard as a rock and the eggs were over poached. Their customer service is great and prices are great and that is why I gave it 3 stars and it's convenient and cheap is the reason why I always come back."}
{"text":"In North Las Vegas and need some late night grub? This place is a good option for that since they are a 24/7 café located inside the Aliante Hotel & Casino. I've only been here a few times, usually late at night after catching a movie, and there is never more than a few tables occupied simultaneously so no need to wait.   However, despite the lack of customers, the service is usually slow and lacking for some reason. Even the cashier isn't very efficient and on our last visit somehow messed up our check despite there being no other customers...our $17+ check became $44+ when our card was swiped...no idea how that mistake is even possible and she had no idea how to cancel/void the transaction.  The food is pretty decent though and on point with any other casino café in town, maybe even slightly better taste-wise. The food will just take a lot longer than other places so don't be in too much of a hurry when coming here. And always double-check your bill before signing if paying with a credit/debit card!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Very affordable. Great portion size. Their menu has a massive variety for everyone to enjoy. If you have an Aliante card, they give monthly dining vouchers. We had a $10 voucher and they accept them here. We had a great dinner and left feeling like we robbed the place! Even when we don't have a voucher, eating here is well worth it."}
{"text":"Buy a cookie!  Farm is basically like a Denny's or iHOP, which a smaller menu and some of the best cookies you'll ever eat in your life.  I frequent Aliante quite a bit, and when I'm tired of the food court options or TGIF's, I'll stop by farm. They have a $4 lunch special daily, which is enough to keep you going (minus the 6 chicken wing special). The food is nothing that you'd crave and write home about. Just basic diner cuisine.   The have a small selection of baked good that you can pop in and purchase. The first time I went in I was appalled by the fact that they only have one type of cookie, but then I tried it and it made total sense. The cookie is a chocolate chip, oatmeal, walnut cookie. It's soft, big and chewy, and you get a bit of each ingredient with every bite. It's one of the best cookies I've ever eaten. A must try.  Cookies - 4.5 stars. Everything else - 2 stars at best."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours. The only restaurant in the casino open 24 hours. Breakfast served all day. Large menu with many options. Frest local ingredients are used here. The prices are very reasonable. The service was very good and even the manager came to our table to check on us.   I had the Denver omelette. It was cooked well and had lots of veggies and ham. I also ordered the French toast. It was large enough to share. Included 8 pieces. It was good and curbed the craving. My boyfriend had the chicken noodle soup. It came out piping hot and smelled delicious. Two other people in our party had the chichen and waffles and egg breakfast. Everyone enjoyed their meal. The portions were just right. I was happy with the food and service here and can't wait to try more of their menu items."}
{"text":"Driving on 17 Av we decided to stop by farm to try their brunch. For your info :  1. It' s not really a brunch menu. There is only 5 brunch dish on the menu. The rest is the regular lunch menu. 2. They like the NO No. (no modification, no eggs cooked on the side, no expresso coffee, no latte,  etc. 3. On the positive points.They support local food. The food is good and the croque madame is really good with sunny side up egg on the top. But on the minus side the dishs are really really small. You need two dishs per person minimum.  So if you are not to angry but want to support local product and have tasty food stop by Farm.  G"}
{"text":"Excellent service and meals at this restaurant. Isabel is one of the best waitress at this place!"}
{"text":"I come here regularly. I usually get the steak and eggs and it's always good. They have fresh ingredients and healthy options. The coffee is some of the best I've had. The corned beef hash and breakfast burrito are also great. Just a heads up though don't get a pancake on the side they are huge, delicious, but huge."}
{"text":"I wish no stars were an option. Placed an order asked that the appetizer be brought out first. Never received it. 15 minutes later we were told that our food was about ready. 15 more minutes.....nothing! Our waitress came by once in a half hour. I asked to speak to the manager, and told her the situation. She did nothing but charge us for the drinks we ordered. Fair enough. We ended up going to panda express. And had food within 5 minutes of leaving the hell hole across the casino. I will not go back and I will ask others to do the same. This place should've never opened."}
{"text":"FARM, is an all around breakfast, lunch, and dinner spot for locals and visitors on the north side of the strip.   Jasmine was friendly, great, and patient with our party of three. I ordered the Croissant French Toast and was definitely a great experience :)"}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks ago while visiting a relative in the hospital. We had a long day and was hungry for some food. We didn't want to go to another buffet so we went here. In short, the food was good, reasonably price, portions are good size and service was spot-on considering we had a party of 10. If you are in North Las Vegas, not inclined to eating at a buffet and do not want to pay and arm & a leg for some good comfort food...eat here."}
{"text":"I expected a little more from this place because of the location.(used to be a original pancake house in it's location) everything was average not too far from a Denny's /IHOP.  When we first arrived I'm not sure if they were short staffed or something but the girl that rings people out was the one to seat us? but she wasn't clear about what the situation was.we were left standing there waiting unsure if it would be a few mins or if there were no tables. .anyway everything was just \"ok\" . .the one thing I did like was that the chicken for the \"chicken & waffles\" wasn't fried to the point where it was annoyingly hard,it was fried just right."}
{"text":"The staff here is super sweet and the pricing is fair, especially considering you're inside a hotel. The food is typical diner food: soups, salads, sandwiches, burgers, etc. The portions are great and everything was fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"This place is usually pretty good. Downside they are inconsistent. You could go there three times in a row and it's good next time it the worst. This is what happened to me. I went there with my family for Sunday breakfast a couple of months ago and the service was terrible and the food was stone cold. The waitress has a terrible attitude and I didn't give her a tip which I've only done once before which was at the Mexican restaurant. Whoever is in charge of the quality of the restaurants at The Aliante Casino needs to check on the quality control of ALL of their restaurants. I've had a bad experience at every single restaurant which I'm sure reflects right back onto the casino hotel."}
{"text":"You want Denny's quality, atmosphere, and flavor but a higher price.... here you go. Big disappointment in the food and Bloody Mary. But i went byv recommendation and didn't check yelp first.... it was a waste during my vacation."}
{"text":"Visited rather late at night (sometime between midnight and 2 am). Food was amazing. I got the BBQ burger which is topped with tasty onion strings. Portions were huge, too! Only reason I wouldn't give 5 stars is that while the servers were nice (I had more than one server check on me, cool stuff!), they did socialize and laugh very loudly at the host stand, which I found to be unprofessional. Also, when refilling drinks they use a pitcher instead of fresh from the fountain which kind of flattens the soda.  If I'm ever back at Aliante I'll eat there."}
{"text":"Service service service!! Damn good in every aspect! Food: delicious. Waiters: dependable. Hostess: friendly! I've been here a handful of times and haven't had a single issue! My personal favorite is the Ruben sandwich! And the hostess Brianna, is such a sweet girl!"}
{"text":"It would be close to a 5 if it was just about the food. The charcuterie, the mac & cheese, the trout and the sides were all excellent. Unfortunately, the food is only part of the experience.  We got off to a bad start right at the doorway. A Farm employee was standing outside as the four of us approached the entrance. He offered my daughter and I a friendly greeting and held open the door for us. Unbeknownst to me, as soon as my daughter and I entered he let go of the door and it slammed in my parents face. We gave him the benefit of the doubt that he did not see my Dad in the wheelchair?  Although I had let the restaurant know in our reservation of our special need, it took a little time to find a suitable seating situation. This seemed to irritate the \" door slam\" guy who turned out to be our server. I certainly got the sense that he was not thrilled to be serving a table that included \"old people\" or someone in a wheelchair. His interactions with us during our dining were perfunctory and it was impossible not to notice he gave far more attention to all the other tables that contained exclusively the younger demographic.   Major. Mistake. Our bill was easily twice the total of any other table around. We were ordering liquor, cutting boards, main courses and sides. The piece de resistance was when he presented the bill and handed me a pos machine without a word and disappeared forever. I printed out the 2 receipts and finally got bored with waiting and left the machine and merchant copy of the bill on the table and left.  Server, If you are an ageist, shame on you.  My parents are sophisticated, worldly, educated and dine out frequently at fine restaurants. They will never patronize your business again as good as your food is. You put a blemish on my daughter's birthday and for that I  will have a very long memory."}
{"text":"After spending time with my boyfriend and his parents at the table, we decided to get some food. We came in around 3-4 AM. Right before the breakfast hit! It was just my boyfriend and I. I'm glad that it's 24/7 because honestly that was the only thing it had going for it. We got seated. It's really old fashioned looking. I think it's a cute breakfast looking restaurant, but it could use some upgrades here and there.   The service was fine. The girls in the front looked really bored though, I felt a little bad. I don't understand why they were so over staffed for a graveyard shift. If they share all the work, it leaves them with nothing to do so you're paying for no reason. But I mean if they want to lose money, it's not my problem. I can't remember our servers name, but she was just adorable! She seemed happy to be there and she recommended what she thought was good!   I got the clam strips and potato skins for the appetizers! The potato skin was the best thing we tried. The clam felt like it was battered in only flour and it was way too rough to chew on. Took forever to get that down. It's a great thought, but horribly executed. I was really disappointed in it because I was looking forward to that. I got the country fried steak and eggs for dinner/breakfast (I should really fix my sleeping schedule.) The country fried steak was literally the worst I have ever had. EVER. It was so damn dry. You can tell it was frozen or reallly fake. Probably both. Terrible gravy too. Of all things, don't mess up the gravy. That's like having water as the broth for your bowl of ramen. You just don't do it. The gravy makes the entire dish better, but it was so bland I couldn't even tell that it was gravy. Seasoning does wonders to food. I'm really not even trying to over reach with it, but it really was the worst I've ever had. It tasted so fake and left a horrible taste and feeling in my mouth. My boyfriend tried it and spit it out.  My boyfriend got the ranch breakfast skillet. The sausage tasted poor in quality. A lot of business' fail to realize that it does take real money to buy better ingredients but you'll eventually make that money back. the ranchero sauce was the worst I've ever tried. I have no idea what it was, but it tasted watered down and tasted like it had wayyy too much cumin.  The only things we were able to finish were the potato skins. We couldn't finish anything else unfortunately. Normally, even if we don't like it, we're able to finish the plate. We both ate about half our plates but could't finish it. Kind of a huge bummer. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Three of my girlfriends and I went there for dinner on a Monday night (they have free corkage!) and had a great time! We ordered cheese and charcuterie to start. Everything came with a delicious pairing and we made quick work of it. Then we enjoyed a different main course each. I tried the rabbit (amazing) and also tasted the lamb on special. Everything was cooked to perfection. Of course we also got desert. The bacon chocolate was one of the best flavoured chocolates I have ever had. And the cheesecake was made with goats milk so it was lactose free! Bonus!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ugh. The food was served barely warm. Service was friendly, but very slow...hence the cold food?"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for a chance to try Farm for over a year and a half now. I get jealous very easily so when I hear people bragging about how much this place kicked ass without my own story to trade, I get grumpy. What? Did you expect me to lie!? For shame.  Their Mac and CHeese is a must. Apparenlty it's available in their cheese market next door. It's a must with the pork shoulder. Going without it just to save yourself $3? thats like buying a car without ABS breaks. DO YOU WANT TO DIE IN WINTER DRIVING CONDITIONS? The panko bread crust completes the dish, it really does. For decades I've invited myself over ot many households and always dug the spoon into the edges of the mac'n'cheese dish, hoping to get the cheesy salty crust. For years I've daydreamed of blowtorching my kraft dinner-spread over a flat backing pan, just to get the same effect.  Their charcuterrie selection is amazing. For 5, 15, 25, you can have a mix/n/match of cheeses and cured meats. We went with aged cheddar, brie, a pate. Here you can have all the bread you need to savour the rich taste of the cheese and meats, just make sure to make room for dessert.  Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 19/30"}
{"text":"Had the brunch, eggs Bennie, a Mac and cheese and a side of potatoes for the table  Mac was excellent as were the taties, eggs Bennie had a tomato spread, quite sweet and vinegar, had to wash it down with water, so strong could not tell if there was ham in there or not?  I suggest ordering the \"jam\" on the side   Excellent service!  Local ingredients"}
{"text":"Terrible food, terribly slow kitchen staff. Just a bad experience. Waited over half an hour for two sandwiches and some chicken tenders. When the food came, two plates were ok, mine was cold, dry and looked like leather. It was supposed to be a French dip with au jus, horseradish and fries. No horseradish, no fries on the plate. WHAT food runner brings you cold, dry, incomplete food? I ordered a replacement meal but that took almost another half hour and the other two people with me were finished. Mind you, there were only three other tables in the entire place.  I asked for it to go...but gave it away. The manager was pleasant and comped our check and said he was working on turning the place around. I sure hope so. I just don't know if I'll go back to see. Plus, it's a smelly place since its in a casino. Not like a strip casino with good circulation but a stinky, dingy casino where it smells more like funk. Just gross. Go anywhere else. Anywhere."}
{"text":"It's a shame that I am writing this because I really used to like this place but I am sadly disappointed. I came here the other night with a friend for dinner and I ordered a burger.. can't go wrong with a burger right? Well there must have been something terribly wrong with that burger or the chef because I got food poisoning. I've never gotten food poisoning at a restaurant or from a simple burger. It was two whole days of torture and today, day 3, I am barely recovering. Sorry Farm but I am never coming back again!"}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me so long to try this restaurant. The interior was very quaint and cozy - I especially like the chandelier and the large wooden table near the window. We ordered some cheeses and meats. We ended up getting the wrong item, but it was good and not worth the fuss of asking for what we originally wanted to order. The house special sandwich was melt in your mouth delicious - layers of warm tender meat and cheeses - the flavours worked well together. The salad was lovely - the lettuce tasted like it was just plucked out of a garden and that dressing was awesome. Server was attentive and took the time to explain every detail of the condiments as well as wine pairings. Nice rose.  This is going to be a regular stop for me."}
{"text":"Hit or miss. I avoid this place on the weekends. My first visit was on a Saturday. It was crazy. The food took forever yet managed to hit the table before our drinks. This last particular midweek visit was great. We ordered the chicken fingers and they were the size of baby arms. My club sandwich was nice. (It's a club sandwich, doesn't exactly blow up the old skirt) The fries were good. The waitress was very nice and brutally honest when we inquired about the pot pie (it had turned out to be salty that day.) I respect that. The portions were large and I felt I had gotten some really good value out of the visit, which is lacking in most restaurants in today's financial climate.  06/17  I dropped a couple of stars because they seem to have succumbed to the food service route. Frozen chicken fingers, bag lettuce etc. Part of the initial original charm was the home cooking vibe that seems to have since gone by the wayside."}
{"text":"We actually ate breakfast at 10am and revisited at 2 AM again. After gambling it was convenient to stumble across a 24/7 Resturant that was open. The croissant french toast with sausage was pretty good. Although, Nothing on the pancakes! If you're in-between the two, go with the pancakes. They are fluffy and mouth watering! The ranch skillet was also appetizing. My second A M visit choosing the chicken fingers was ok. It was more meat than breaded crust. Bad ratio, crusted batter to chicken meat - But it was still good."}
{"text":"Pretentious, overpriced, and not doing what it claims to be doing, this restaurant also misses the mark on successfully creating the atmosphere it intended. We went here a few months ago, particularly because of its reputation and that the place stressed LOCAL fare.  Is the food decent...yeah. Is it memorable...no.  Without the pretense and price I might have rated it a bit higher, but what killed it for me was the charcuterie. Not that it wasn't palatable, in fact it is a great idea, but do not let them select your accoutrements as they often miss at this as well. But, with a choice of something like 15 cheeses, the great Janice Beaton could only come up with one somewhat local offering??? Almost all the cheeses were European. What about Comox Brie? What about Quebec's Oka and MANY recent award winners? What about the recently recognized Sylvan Star in little old Red Deer? In fact there are thousands of cheeses produced in Canada, many of them exceptional, so if you want to showcase local products then search them out!  Also, the atmosphere was loud, tables are crammed in, and the decor is a little too much of a mish-mash...not developed enough for the price. Felt like just more than a cafeteria. If you want to do homey, farmhouse, there are many places that have done it successfully. In fact, we recently stopped at an organic, hippie coffee/lunch spot in Fernie that did this SO much better than farm. My husband and I both made the comment at the time that this little, unasuming, modest place had created the atmosphere that the great Farm had intended, but missed.  I would suggest that you just skip this place."}
{"text":"Alrighty, this review is going to be quick and gritty. It's a cafe in a casino....a cafe in a casino next to Sun City. The food is typical cafe food but because of their target market restricted low salt diet be prepared to add your own seasoning. Other than it being bland it's what you expect from a cafe in a casino. The place is located where the original pancake house was, I miss that place :-( 49er flap jacks....sigh....okay it's gone move on......  Let's talk about the saving grace of this cafe, the service!! Oh My G-O-S-H those employees should be cloned and sent across the valley!! I was debating on giving this place 4 stars just because the service was that good. My server Gurgen was great! He was attentive not just to me but my little girl. He caught me using Lily name and started calling her directly by her name the whole meal...that's the kind of stuff I love!   But good service only gets you so far, will I return? Maybe, I do have a little nugget and that place is super child friendly. Would I return without the nugget in tow? Nope"}
{"text":"I highly recommend the farm skillet. Eggs, potatoes, seasonal veggies from around town, so they say, all under $8. Hard to beat that! However I have to agree with some of the other posts on here, the service is not that great. It's sad but true because the food is so good me and my family have had it multiple times and never had any problems once our food is out. But the service definitely needs to be worked out. They should look at the yelp reviews and take a hint"}
{"text":"When I first arrived it was not very busy but by the time I left, it was crowded and very loud in there.  The service was friendly, but super slow. Took a long time to get a refills or to get  our order.  The decor is simple with pictures taken from local places which adds a nice flare.  I know to expect smoky smell when being in a casino, but it was pretty bad, even sitting toward the back of the place.  My party seemed to be happy with their various breakfast items that they ordered. Prices seemed right on.  Good that they try to buy local-  Not sure I will be back. I feel other places offer tastier food, no smoke smell, and quicker service."}
{"text":"don't eat here...bad service, under staffed, food is yucky shoron was our waitress, absolutely horrible , eat at friday's"}
{"text":"I too am very happy to see a coffee shop in Aliante Casino and yes it is overdue but again it appears as if the rush to open verse opening well is compromised.  For the wait, i found the coffee shop understaffed. Service was painfully slow and the waiters needed a bit more training. All good people who are trying hard but lack basic experience. I am sure in time they will get better. The manager should stay off his cell phone and pay more attention to his customers. Texting while he should be watching his coffee shop is not a very good sign when your customers are frustrated with bad service. Waiter did not know what the soup of the day was, coffee refills were slow if they showed up at all. Now the food. Cant screw up eggs but get off the simple path and my cheeseburger was overdone, bread was skimpy and crumbled easy as if it was a few days old. The pickle had no taste and the veggies appeared to have been left out for a few hours before they found my plate. Total time from ordering to plate arriving was 47 minutes. A new disappointing record that can only be broken by their sister restaurant, The Bistro where I waited over an hour for eggs benedict once. Had to stop going there too.  Bottom Line, Great idea, poorly executed. I really want to see this place succeed but is appears as if it needs professional help getting started. Staff and procedures are crossing each other and fumbling each time. Get rid of the  fancy clothe napkins for good basic paper ones, don't have the waiter do it all, take orders, fill drinks, clear off tables and be a cashier when you got four hostess standing around. Get back to basics, get rid of the cell phones!"}
{"text":"Every trip to Calgary includes a stop at Farm."}
{"text":"Hands down the best food I've had in Calgary. This places offers many excellent staples as well as a daily menu. In addition to the great food, Farm pairs their wines to match the food superbly!  This little spot also excels in terms of atmosphere and has a fully exposed kitchen."}
{"text":"It's great to contribute to local food suppliers, and delicious ;) The mac and cheese is so rich and decadent, as though the macaroni noodles were baked in fondue cheese. I remember eating here for the first time and how the dish was served with pickles...How did they know that mac & cheese with pickles was my fave?!   When I return to my original hometown of Calgary, I make a stop here with my sister and we share lunch. My family is also a fan of their steak, and cheese in general. Janice Beaton Cheese provides you guessed it, and wow is it ever something.   This is a small, pleasantly decorated space with rustic touches. In my experience the staff are friendly, and knowledgeable about the specifics of the origins of the local ingredients.   Great place to go with family or to catch up with a friend, because it's generally quiet so you will be able to hear each other speaking. Or just enjoy it solo, and really appreciate the food.   Farm serves local ingredients in an intimate yet urban setting... Love it!"}
{"text":"I was in town for business and thought I'd try some place I hadn't been before.  Farm completely exceeded my expectations.  I sat at the open kitchen and enjoyed watching the chefs work.  The waitress was great and walked me through their menu, specials, cheese/charcuterie options, and the wine flight (the special for Wednesday nights).    I tried the wine flight and had the special pickerel, peanut butter chocolate dessert, and a housemade chocolate truffle.  Surprisingly, the housemade truffle left a bit to be desired, but everything else was superb.  There were about 12 other things on the menu I wanted to try, so if I'm in town again, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"After reading the mixed reviews of this place I was hesitant to stay but I really wanted breakfast and my family and I were late coming down from the room so we stayed. I have to stay breakfast was pretty good and filling. I really appreciated how the manager on duty (Ben? Did not quite catch his name) went around checking in on the tables. I would say visit this place for breakfast food, but probably go somewhere else for dinner."}
{"text":"This is my favorite quick and inexpensive restaurant to eat at on this side of town.  I haven't tried much on the menu because I'm picky about some stuff, but everything I've had so far was delicious.  The food is always fresh and the service is always great.  The good thing about this place being in a casino is that it is open 24/7!  So yay for me when I get hungry at 11:00 at night and want something good to eat."}
{"text":"Excellent food; great service!!! My wife and I are regulars at the Cannery but decided to try Aliente's cafe, Farm. We were very impressed that they source produce from local farms and that the menu changes daily to reflect that. EVERYTHING was GREAT! We loved the food, the atmosphere and the service. Our server John was very polite and extremely good at making guests feel welcome and appreciated. The manager Rafael was also very friendly and appreciative of our comments. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"By far some of the worst food I've had out! I ordered the pot roast and it was so bad that I returned it. The meat was cut too big and was tough and chewy. There wasn't enough potatoes and I felt like it needed some rice. The overall taste of the dish wasn't good and I like pot roast!  The manager started to front me and was like you have to have your receipt even though the waitress who just helped me was there. She found the receipt in the bag which was good because I would hate to think what she would have said if she didn't find that receipt. I exchanged it for the chicken teriyaki and was given a cookie to make up for the price difference.   The teriyaki was terrible terrible terrible! I don't know why I ordered teriyaki from here but I figured they couldn't mess up rice chicken and veggies. Wrong! The chicken was all breast and had zero flavor. The sauce was too thin and tasted like nothing but sugar. The veggies had no butter, no salt and were barely cooked. They tasted like they were picked this morning and served raw. I was so disappointed I ate what I could then threw the rest away. I hate that I paid for this meal!  The only saving grace was the cookie. It was pretty good but not good enough to purchase.  Find somewhere else to eat!"}
{"text":"*CHEESY GOODNESS*  The home of the greatest Mac & Cheese in Calgary!  The interior was nicely design with urban cosy - meets New York chic. Personally I loved how the tables were positioned near each other in the openess that your connected with everyone. Farm is always bustling with people some ordering pick-up  while others hanging out to enjoy their meal. The chefs prepares your meal in the front area and the waiting time is anywhere from 15-40 minutes depending on how busy the location is or if your dish needs extra time cooking.  Located in the back of the Restaurant is a Deli that serves ever Legal Cheese Canada can offer, cured meats, olives and salads (most ingredients local).  It's classy yet humble setting is welcoming and entices you to come back. The service is always friendly... the only problems is I never go there as much as I'd wish!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight and it did not disappoint. Tuesdays are $35 3-course dinner nights. There was only one option so we ordered one of the prix-fix dinner courses and another main off the regular menu, plus the house pickles. This was just the perfect amount of food for us. We left in a delicious food coma but stopped just short of feeling uncomfortably ill. Great portion sizes. The salad was perfectly dressed - lots of flavour without being too filling. Both mains were great. Not too complicated but lots of great flavours that complimented each other perfectly. The dessert was one of the best either of us has ever had. Lots of unexpected flavours that surprised and impressed. It almost burned the tongue a little but in a rather pleasant way. Service was great. Food came very quickly and everyone was very friendly and attentive. Would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"We've never stopped at Aliante Casino before but they are convenient to the DMV on Decatur, so we decided to go there for lunch. After wandering around to see what the choices were outside of the food court, we chose \"Farm\". They have very good lunch specials for only $4. I had the chicken soup and a half sandwich. The soup was a small cup and it was better than average, although a bit salty, it was full of meat and noodles.  My half sandwich was corned beef on rye.  It was hand sliced and was a generous portion of meat. My companion had an omelette, with fried potatoes. He said it was pretty good.  The reason for only three stars was the waitress never brought any set-ups, napkins and utensils.  She was very nice and friendly, but needed to be asked. Then she only brought one and we had to ask for a second set-up.  The food was actually good, served hot and served quickly. I would go there again if I were in the area."}
{"text":"I had an amazing seasonal dish that was only on the menu that week.  It was all local, etc, piece of darkmeat.  I cant even explain all the details, I had to take notes from the chef, but didnt.  I was hungry and my friend wasn't, so we just sat at the kitchen, he had a cheese tasting platter and I had a meal of the dark chicken baked&fried with some amazing local greens.  It was fine dining at its best in a professional atmosphere.  I have never had a piece of dark chicken that tasted so phenomenal.  The menu always changes and sometimes things are never revisited, so this place is one of my all time high's.  This is the shit I live for."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast on Sunday morning before we left.  We both ordered skillets.  The service was great and the food tasted good.  The ingredients are local sourced: farm to table."}
{"text":"Recently made a visit for some breakfast to this establishment. I really enjoyed my French Toast that I ordered it was very good and I didn't have any issues.  The price is a fair value for the amount of food receive the only issues that I had was the exploding glasses that your drink is in but it adds a nice touch. At the end of our meal they even offered us drinks to go if we wanted. Awesome service!  The wait wasn't very long at all for breakfast we were seated almost immediately and the waitress was waiting for us at our table!"}
{"text":"Went late night to get a bite to eat, breakfast was okay, server seemed nice. The place is okay if nothing else is open, but during the day the service and food quality seem to be less then great."}
{"text":"Very nice cafe offering an eclectic menu and daily specials. Nice offerings 24/7 for whatever craving you may have, with special deals for Aliante card holders.  Fairly spacious, this is a nice place for bigger groups or people with young children/strollers!  I highly recommend the prime rib here, and the garlic toast is delicious. Hoping to make it to dessert next time."}
{"text":"Going to a casino for \"farm to table fresh food\" isn't what I typically seek out at, well, a casino. I'm looking for a bargain meal to satisfy my hunger at odd hours of the day. Breakfast served 24/7 hours, you say? I'm down.   However, I come here for the pancakes. Get out of my way, Denny's and IHOP. Farm is where I'll be when I need pancakes. For under 10 bucks I can get the buttermilk pancakes with chocolate chips cooked right in them instead of added as a topping. Did I mention that these cakes are bigger than your average-size Frisbee, and you get TWO? No joke, you'll be in a carb-induced coma, but it's worth every bite. Pro tip: Don't bother ordering the red velvet stack of flap jacks, which is Farm's daily special. It's just regular pancakes with added red food coloring to fool you into thinking you're going to get legit red velvets.   I have yet to try the other offerings on the menu. Truthfully, I probably won't try anything else. I'm sticking to what I know is all right."}
{"text":"Went to the Farm for dinner last night. We both ordered Country fried steak with gravy on the side.  When our dinners finally arrived, they both had gravy on the steak.  Sent them back, when they finally came back they were inedible.  I think they \"cleaned-up\" the original steak, reccoated and refried it.  The coating wasn't sticking well, when I cut the first bite, the coating fell off, the meat  was black, hard and greasy.  By the way it wasn't steak it was ground meat of some kind. No way was I going to eat that mess and pay for it.  Won't be back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The funny thing about this place is, I love going here by myself. Don't get me wrong, I love going with other people too.. it's just such an adorable, delicious little place to have breakfast or go on a date. The menu is always changing with fresh choices and it's always buzzing. It's very romantic yet perfect for a girls date! One of my favorite little joints in Calgary!"}
{"text":"I thought I'd already left a review for this place but I don't see it so here it goes again.  I checked out the Farm for dinner one night last summer when I was in town on a business trip. I had made a reservation online and they were expecting me when I arrived, asking me how my drive went, etc. Nice welcome.  The place was pretty busy and as a single, they sat me by the kitchen bar, which was fine by me - I loved watching the chefs prepare their dishes. Food was great - I had a crispy duck confit, and a side of mushrooms and fiddleheads - simple but well seasoned and delicious. You can tell they use fresh, high quality ingredients.   Service was great, the waitress was chatty and attentive and knowledgeable on the food and wine - they have a reasonable by the glass selection and suggestions were great! Price-wise, I think it is on the expensive side but not when you consider the quality of the food and the overall yumminess :) I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've known about Farm for some time but it's never really been on my radar.  Maybe because it seems a little less veggie friendly than I prefer.    We ended up here on a whim - I wanted a tubby dog but they were out of notdogs so I left and than ended with us sitting down at Farm.   All I can say is thank you to tubby dog for not managing your supply because Farm ended up being a real treat.    I had spicy mac and cheese and an order of seasonal veggies and holy smokes were they to die for.  I can't think of many instances where I would happily have made a meal from my side of season veggies but they were so delicious and could have easily ordered more and done just that.    The mac and cheese used excellent cheese selection and was heavenly spiced to give it a zippiness that I loved.   Totally on par with some of the best elevated homestyle/farmhouse places I've been around north america and I'm very pleased to have this one in Calgary.  Sometimes a meal is so good you have to try a dessert even when you don't have a sweet tooth and this was such an dinner.    Actually,  we got one each rather than sharing because it was so much so that kind of dinner.   I ordered chocolate peanut butter pot de creme and homemade cookies.  Simple kind of dessert but it so good and totally worth another order.  Over all it was NOT a healthy meal but it was one that made the unhealthiness worth it as a treat.  The menu changes up often but that likely something useful to note for meat eating patrons as vegetarians will wait a while to get something other than mac and cheese to rotate through the menu.  But.... there is nothing wrong with delicious mac and cheese if I do say so myself.  Will return for another round sometime - that's for sure."}
{"text":"I've been there a couple of times and I thought the food was very good. They have a lot of really interesting menu choices and everything tasted very fresh and full of flavour. I highly recommend the macarons for dessert.  The service was also very very good."}
{"text":"This place is $5 for adults $2 for kids, and everything there is to do costs even more money. The website doesnt say any of this. I'm very aggravated that i spent $11 to get me and my kids in here and still cant do anything without paying at least $3 more PER KID. I feel rather ripped off. I wont be back."}
{"text":"3 STARS. DOWNGRADE. Have been here many times in the last 3 years. Something has changed. It's the little things that make a big difference. They seem to have disappeared. The little extras on the market salad. The taste of the main dishes. Not quite 'there' anymore. The chefs appear to have turned over in the past year. Super chef Pete is gone. The connections between employees. Still all is good, just not superior. I'm giving this a pass for now."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for a late dinner after a long flight. Stuck with traditional fare (buffalo wings, chicken fingers, fish and chips). The food was hot and fresh and service was good considering it was late night and only one or two staff working the restaurant. I would go back and definitely want to try their breakfast which looks good too!"}
{"text":"I thought about my review about for this place, but it was always between 2 and 3 stars for me.  FWIW, the service was not bad. Our server was friendly and quite prompt... once he knew he was our server. Considering that the place was basically empty at 10pm on a Tuesday, there shouldn't be so much confusion.  Farm Cafe boasts that as many as their ingredients as can be are locally sourced. When available. So who really knows what comes from where.  The food here is relatively uninspired. What it clearly aims to be is a generic casino cafe restaurant, but their prices aren't very cheap nor is there anything that screams 'interesting' on the menu.  I ordered a meatloaf \"tower.\" I emphasize the word tower because in fact it was just a single slice of meatloaf. I'm not exactly sure how that qualifies as any sort of tall structure. The meatloaf was decent as was the gravy, but the onion strings were overdone and the plate consisted primarily of average mashed potatoes. The best item on the dish was the vegetables, which there were far too few of.  I was there with six others, and asking around, the general attitude was \"meh.\" I'd have to agree. Honestly, I think the food might be better at Denny's, but it wasn't a big surprise."}
{"text":"24 hour restaurant located inside the Aliante casino and hotel. I really wasn't expecting much but we were hungry for breakfast after our drive back from Mount Zion and decided to drop in and give it a try. I'm definitely impressed.   The service was top notch. The waitress and hostess were friendly and always wore a smile. The food was very good as well. No, it's not gourmet dining it's more like a Black Bear Diner. Definitely a good place for breakfast. The home fries were probably the best I've ever had and the eggs Benedict was not too shabby itself at only $9. My only complaint and the slightest one at that was that the poached egg was a little overcooked. Usually the egg should just drizzle over the Canadian bacon and English muffin when it's cut open but it didn't. Not a big deal but I'm a avid eggs Benedict eater so I know how it's supposed to be. Other than that the hollandaise sauce was perfect as was the rest of the Benedict.   My hubby got the country fried steak and I was impressed. Perfectly fried and perfectly creamy white gravy. Yum.   Overall I give this place two thumbs up. Usually cafes at casinos that are 24 hours disappoint but not this one. It's nice that they use fresh farm veggies and fruits too. We left paying $19 for a big breakfast for two. That's awesome in Vegas."}
{"text":"When Farm does food well it does food extremely well. I love their greens, pickles, and olives. They are phenomenal. The salad dressing is delicious and the wine list is comprehensive.   My only complaint is that Farm is such a meat heavy restaurant. Also, it has a rotating menu depending on the seasons. Once I went and had this amazing warm beet salad. It was everything a gal would want in a main. I had dreams about that salad, but I haven't been able to get it again since.   Regardless, I will be going to Farm again."}
{"text":"Small, busy restaurant on 17th ave.  Went Saturday Mar 5th for the 'big taste of calgary' lunch.  We had the $15 option, which was salad, soup and burger, then cookies.  wow.  Salad was ok, burger was Delicious!  Gotta love Spring creek beef!  Such a soft bun, and was the highlight of the meal for sure.  Soup was ok, cookies were like fresh from Grandmas.  A lot of people were ordering brunch when we were there at noon.  Looked appetizing.  Worth going to."}
{"text":"Update... Another visit to Farm and still disappointing. Brown lettuce, never got a refill (still waiting as I write this) the BBQ burger had only a drop of sauce, and it sat for long time as it was cold with cheese that went back to its solid state!  I won't even get into how bad the french fries are. If you come here order breakfast items only!"}
{"text":"4 Diamond Hotel, I think not with the service.  Sad to say the worst experience in a long time.  Also sad that I used to recommend this restaurant to people looking for a place to eat, because of the references I received from people........Never Again.....  My son back from deployment and visiting and hungry.   I live inly a few miles and heard about how good this place is.  Drive up to Aliante Casino where the restaurant is located.    Waited about 10 to 15 minutes to be seated, acceptable until we got in and half the tables weren't being used, also on this note the manager (yes I know he's a manager) said lets go, hoping he was speaking to someone else I blew it off. Hindsight I'm thinking otherwise.  It's a Friday (1/23/15) evening, have the staff, anyway, were seated by the cook station, and told we will be served shortly, thought it was surprising we weren't offered something to drink.    We sit, having decided what we wanted to eat, and wait, and wait, and wait.  Waters and staff keep walking back and forth by us, the hostesses keep sitting people.  Finally a waiter says I'll be right with you.  OK, he know were here, or not.    I realize that a party of 2 my son and me can't compete with parties of 5 and 8.  Why because they came in after us and, SUPRISE....got service right away.  After the seating of the 5th table got service and we got nothing, not even water, we left.    Lesson learned, I will not wait for 15 minutes and no service.  I will not ever again visit this restaurant and, will encourage people to gamble elsewhere, if there is any possibility of you wanting something to eat while you give the casino your money.  There are plenty of places where you can get service and, service with a smile.    Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"ask for Anthony's table. he's engaged, great attitude, genuinely cares about his job and his customers. he makes the food sound and taste just a little bit better... and they have breakfast served all day!"}
{"text":"So full disclosure: I'm vegan and this is a meat heavy restaurant.  I'm docking one star for the lack of a proper vegan entree.   But besides that everything else exceeded my expectations.  The pickles and olives were amazing- the best pickles I've ever had.  The market salad was absolutely delicious and the employees were informative about the salad dressing and all the toppings. The wine list was comprehensive and the offerings were high quality.    Had a great time at farm!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Prices were good and Evelyn was a great server. Not like most hotel restaurants."}
{"text":"I wanted to dislike this place for its cool hipster vibe, the servers in their skinny jeans and thick rimmed glasses, the whole organic \"straight from the farm mantra\" and, not to mention, being from Edmonton. But I simply loved it.   I had breakfast which was the best I've had in years.  I had the special: a corned beef sandwich topped with an egg.  It was awesome. My female companion had the yogurt and granola (of course) but as everything was \"straight from the farm\"  it was excellent. Finally the coffee, which is of critical importance, was fantastic. For 2 people breakfast was around $50 with tip.   My only complaint is that the coffee is not \"bottomless\", as I think all breakfast places should offer. Instead they offer small and large French Press pots,  but the coffee was so good that a large wasn't enough and I didn't feel like paying another $10 for a cup.   I will be back again, next time wearing skinny jeans and a second hand plaid shirt so I look like a regular!"}
{"text":"Previously had come here for lunch with friends on two occasions. Finally brought my wife and son for dinner. Caroline had the braised lamb shoulder, CJ had the Mac & Cheese, I had the pork loin/belly duet. All good, and we ended with a 5-cheese plate and a macaron trio for dessert. Because we stayed late, we saw how the kitchen staff meticulously cleaned their work areas and packed everything for the night, and we were impressed with how efficient and methodical they were. They had to be, given the tiny space they have to work with!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was very good. The food was really fresh like the farm to table concept. Prices are reasonable. Service was just ok. I would come back here for sure.  Had the waffle really light and tasty and syrup was nice and light not overly sweet. Also had the cheddar bacon omelet the eggs were good but cooked a little more done than I like."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Good service. I recommend the turkey dinner it's awesome ! I go here atleast once a week now."}
{"text":"Solid 3 1/2 stars!  What?  Restaurant promoting fresh, locally sourced ingredients...open 24 hours a day?  In the middle of a hotel casino??  Now that's a big 1st.  For what it's worth, Farm was definitely A-OK.  Wifey and I came on a date night with a nice $10 off dining coupon from Aliante Casino in hand.  Ha ha...yep cheap date!  Wasn't feeling the buffet, didn't want Mexican food or tapas, didn't want food court fare, couldn't afford the steakhouse (LOL)...so we ended up at the only choice left, Farm.  And for a Friday night it was actually a near packed house!  Ended up waiting 15 minutes or so for a table.  Upon entering the restaurant it does feel pretty homey.  Reminiscent of I guess an actual farm, or at least some country living.  Their menu is definitely very American, lots of down-home comfort dishes, with breakfast being served all day long.  They also have a lunch menu & dinner menu.  After much debate on the dinner menu (there were a lot of great sounding choices), we ordered:  *Fried Chicken ($11.49) - subbed with fresh sautéed seasonal veggies, also comes with coleslaw *Fish & Chips ($10.29) - beer battered cod, French fries, coleslaw  Caveat about the Fried Chicken - it takes nearly 25 minutes for this dish!  It even says it on the menu to allow the time for it to be cooked.  According to the waitress, the chefs actually cook each platter TO ORDER.  So don't order the Fried Chicken if you're in a rush!  She wasn't kidding though, that chicken came out piping HOT.  For sure it was fresh out of the fryer!  Wifey had to give it a few minutes to actually cool down some so she could eat it.  But wow, does it make all the difference!  Farm's Fried Chicken is very tasty!  Good crust, moist on the inside, flavorful on the outside.  Generous serving too with 4 nice sized pieces.  Delicious with a splash of Tabasco & a dip of ketchup!  Sautéed veggies and the coleslaw were average, nothing to write home about.  The Fish & Chips were good as well!  Thankfully battered & cooked fresh, they came out hot to the touch.  Batter wasn't too heavy, cod inside was moist & flaky.  Pieces were large as well!  Had no complaints when I was chowin' down...a splash of malt vinegar & a touch of tartar sauce made the meal complete.  Probably could have taken it up a notch if the tartar sauce was house-made instead of bottled.  The chips weren't really CHIPS, they were well...they were French fries.  So not totally authentic but oh well.  Wifey was right on the coleslaw though, doesn't really do anything.  Rather enjoyed the meal here at Farm, I have no real complaints.  Could of course improve, but it's better than a handful of diner/restaurants I've been too since living here in LV.  Best part of the meal though?  The price!  After our coupon, dinner only set me back $17 and change after tax & tip.  NOICE!!  More money to spend on the slot machines!  Yes, literally right outside the Farm entrance...no more than 10 steps away, are slot machines waiting to make you a BAZILLIONAIRE.  OK, probably not.  Farm, oh yeah I'll be back!  I got another coupon this month!  Ha!"}
{"text":"We walked in and were handed breakfast menus, it was 6pm. The spinach artichoke dip was really good as was the vegetable medley. I was shocked that a restaurant called farm would use instant potatoes. The pork chops were over cooked and the fried chicken too greasy. Something was really off with the ambiance as well. So not impressed."}
{"text":"We were at Aliante Casino & Hotel to watch a movie. We had a few hours to spare and were both starving. The problem with Aliante Casino & Hotel is the lack of great and quick places to eat at. We weren't feeling the food court and decided on Farm. I really didn't expect a lot from Farm due to their 3 star review average.  I have to be honest, the service was pretty good.  I read some of the reviews and the complaint is slow service.  We didn't have that issue when we dined here.  We were seated right away and only had to wait about 10 minutes for our orders to be taken.  The food took another 10 minutes to be served. I got a cup of chili and the T-bone steak dinner.  The chili was pretty good and had some kick to it.  However, I wasn't too impressed with my steak.  It was dry, very fatty, and gray.  I know that this may sound weird, but I prefer my steaks to be brown, not gray.  Bottom line, the belly was feed and I got my protein in.    The restaurant wasn't busy when we arrived, but started to get really busy around 6:30 PM.  Their menu is basically the same as a Denny's and prices are about the same.  During the late nights is when the deals start.  Look for their late night/early bird specials that start at 11:00 PM and end at 6:00 AM.  You can find breakfast meals and dinner entrees starting as slow at $3.99."}
{"text":"Do not wast you money on the over priced supper salty pressed meat they call a hamburger here. I swear they coated the patty in salt before cooking, it was barely edible."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here and it was pretty decent. Nice atmosphere and service. Not overpriced at all. They had a good selection our server was nice and they even extended the military discount without us asking to the entire party on a split. We can't complain. Overall good experience!"}
{"text":"The food here is not good at all. We ordered bbq beef brisket and sausage and the tuna melt. The brisket was smothered in bbq sauce which I could live with but the meat had fat on it which should have been trimmed off. Nothing is worse than unknowingly putting a fork full of fat in your mouth. The cornbread was old and dry and the side of potato salad was discolored on the top and old as if it was sitting for a while uncovered. It tasted like supermarket potato salad (no flavor). My girlfriend had the tuna melt and only ate half. She said it wasn't good, had no flavor and didn't want any more. The name FARM and signage leads you to believe that the food served would be a fresh farmers market type meal, similar to the Hash House. Service was not bad but just okay. In comprehension, the Cannery's cafe provides much better service. I have ate at a lot different places on all levels and this is gotta be one of the worse. I'm not the guy that is going to complain because a poorly ran establishment is the fault of management not the workers. I just simply never return. I gotta say that the House of Pancakes the once occupied this restaurant was excellent and I am not sure why it was closed."}
{"text":"Yay !  Finally a non buffet breakfast place around here!  We came two days in a row and this is the 2nd/3rd  day they opened their doors.  So, I'm giving them a benefit of the doubt  by rounding up 3.5 star to 4, as I know with any new restaurant, have to iron out the kinks :)  Hubby and I came at 11:30 am,  and they stopped serving breakfast at 11 am :-( No fear we live down the street.   For lunch, I had the Ruben sandwich and hubby had the meatloaf sandwich.  Both were good. Our waitress Heather was great.    Came the next day for breakfast, and boy it was busy!! 8 am and there was already a 5-10 min wait.   I order farm skillet and hubby had the country fried steak .  I thought the farm skillet was okay, it was a bit on the greasy side. Hubby said the country friend steak was okay.   Our waiter: Shawn (feel really sorry for him, he was overwhelm with too many tables- i think he had 8 or 9 tables at once point) He forgot our coffee but made it up at the end by not charging for them at the end :)    Food: good ( Lunch : 4 Star   Breakfast: 3.5 Star) Service : hit or miss (depending on how busy they are) - I think they really need more servers for breakfast time.   Price: great  !  Lunch price ~$10/person  , Breakfast ~$9/person  Tip for the owner (if you are reading):  1) Please serve breakfast till 2 pm ?  I think stopping at 11 am is a bit too early.  2) Definitely need more waiter/waitress - this is pretty much the only breakfast place around this side of town ! Most breakfast place wants to crowd around Centennial :/"}
{"text":"We dined there on Friday nite. We both had the Blue Plate special which was Braised Short Ribs with carrots over a bed polenta with a wine sauce. First of all, you notice I said Ribs, well we got a chunk of meat, not even a short rib, plopped in the middle of a bowl full of polenta; under the meat chunk was two medallions of carrots and a piece of celery. There was hardly any wine sauce. It was the worse meal we had ever eaten. In my opinion, I would Not Recommend The Farm since I had better meals at a Fast Food Joint !!!"}
{"text":"Big, good sized portions. Waitstaff has always been very polite and attentive. Food is good. Fried pickles are amazing, a must try. Turkey dinner is great, turkey BLT, pretty much any breakfast items are all great. Quiet tucked away area so you're not having to smell casino smoke or hear the machines while trying to enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"Went here last night around 10pm, ordered bacon cheeseburger and fries. Fries were amazing and crispy burger was huge too big for my mouth, and yummy too. Customer service was excellent and courteous, food cane quickly."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that will make you regret spending money on out to eat.    I was drawn in by the baskets of fresh produce sitting around, making it look and feel like you are about to get a, fresh from the garden, home cooked meal.    The food is way below average.  My husband and I both ordered omelets.  My husband took two bites and pushed his plate aside.  I have never, in 25 years, known him to do that.  The coffee was not great.  I ordered a mimosa, which was nothing spectacular.  The best thing about this place was the rye toast.    The employees were all strange.  It sorta felt like the Twilight Zone.  Our waiter was super friendly, just very very weird.  Returning to this place is highly unlikely...even on someone elses dime."}
{"text":"We tried this place after a movie. Service was good, fast. Waiter checked on us several times. I tried the Corned Beef / Cabbage special, was pretty good. Wife tried the Caesar Salad, good dressing lettuce was crisp. Son thief the T-Bone and he says it was perfect. So we were a little surprised it was as good as it was. Will go again."}
{"text":"2 of us went for breakfast today. But only 1 of us liked our food. The Farm Skillet was great, the farm fresh vegetables tasted great, the wheat toast was dry and cold. The horrible breakfast was the croissant french toast-looked good but after one bite you could tell it was undercooked and mushy. Our waitress never did come check on us after our food was delivered so we ate what we could stomach. Got seated by a air conditioning vent that constantly blew cold air. Service should have been better as they were not that busy. I will give them another shot someday."}
{"text":"We went for a prix-fixe dinner on New Year's Eve and everything was exceptional: food, service, price, and wine pairings. We sat at the bar and chatted with the cooks and servers, all of whom were friendly and knowledgeable about food, wine, and local happenings. The duck liver pate amuse-bouche, the terrine, and the goat cheese and pollen panna cotta were definite highlights of the meal."}
{"text":"Well, looks like the secret is getting out. My little family started coming here last winter. This is where I discovered their delicious chicken pot pie. My kid was satiated with their chicken tenders and fries. My husband is a fan of their chicken fried steak. My daughter asked why there was always only old people in there. I told her because there is a retirement community near by and old people like to eat well but don't like to cook. Enough said.    I also like this place because they serve Pepsi products and most places we go serve Coke. Farm reminds me of the restaurants I used to eat in as a kid with the family. I think there name would suggest they are new age and trendy but I feel its more old timey which is a great niche in my book. Prices are good too and those chocolate chip cookies at the front counter are delicious. Now if Regal theater at Aliante would upgrade to luxury seating......yeayah."}
{"text":"My new location after Church.  The pancakes are delicious the waitress was very friendly, and the food was cheap."}
{"text":"This is quite a pricy place but I supposed anything on 17th is. We got the Mac and cheese and the Farm salad. Both were very tasty. Small portions for the cost though. I really enjoyed their French pressed coffee. It's a small place with maybe a dozen tables. It gets busy for lunch so a reservation may be required if you come in by noon. They open at 11:30 so if you're there early you may be able to snag a table. I was satisfied with the meal. I don't eat much though. For a bigger person with a larger appetite it may not be the place for you."}
{"text":"We absolutely love everything we have eaten here!  The specials have been beyond expectations and the service is beyond friendly.  We feel like they remember us every time!  If your to full for dessert get a chocolate chip cookie to go and you will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at our 1st visit here.  Ended up here due to long line at buffett.  We loved the food. Pancakes were huge, almost too sweet, but really good. All were happy in our party. Price was surprisingly affordable. Will definitely be back in stead of buffett."}
{"text":"Finally got the opportunity to bring hubs here.  It was my birthday, my choice ;).  Being a meat and potatoes kind of guy I have to say he is getting better (only taken 10 yrs) and he very much enjoyed our charcuterie plate which consisted of 3 cheese & 3 meats (I could seriously eat like this all day).    I went on to have the mac & cheese (with the pork shoulder option) I've heard so much about and hubs ordered the crispy pork belly.   Unfortunately they forgot to add the pork shoulder to my mac & cheese and hubs' pork belly was not crispy...BUT each dish was enthusiastically enjoyed.  The mac & cheese alone was Divine and something I would come back for over and over again.  Happily you can purchase the mac & cheese from the cheese/take out shop in the back.  Janice Beaton does not disappoint and again I left feeling happy & full.  Oh did I mention my dessert (the peanut butter pots de creme with a thick milk chocolate & rock salt on top) pretty much blew my socks off?  Thought I'd died and gone to heaven....I must make this recipe...and the mac & cheese.  But until then I will be back.    Mmmmmm good."}
{"text":"Delicious delicious delicious!  Yum!  This ahead of its time bistro has delicious bites that are creative and thought out.  The GF bun option is surprisingly delicious and did unmentionable service outstanding.  I had the special sandwich of the day, Confit Turkey sandwich with double brie, dijon mustard, arugula accompanied by the cauliflower and broccoli soup.  Great selection of wine and we finished off our meal with a French press coffee."}
{"text":"This is my Third time here and every time the service has been phenomenal!! The host that greeted us was very welcoming! The server was really nice also! He came back and checked on us several times! The breakfast here is really good, I ordered an omelette, it can with  the typical veggies and ham and bacon ingredients options to go in the omelette my only complaint is they didn't offer chicken which I had to pay and additional $2.99 for!! Other than that the food was good! My husband ordered the corn beef hash which came out fresh w smothered style potatoes and eggs. Overall I would recommend this place esp for a quick breakfast stop."}
{"text":"I am SO thrilled that I was finally able to try Farm! After hearing and reading so many wonderful things about it, I finally made a reso for a girlfriend & I for dinner. Unfortunately, she had to cancel at the last minute but I was DETERMINED to eat here and luckily for me, my sister was free! We met at 10 minutes past the hour, which meant we were late for our reso, but were seated immediately. I was hoping for a table on the patio, but it was busy, and I was SO impressed with the interior of the restaurant! From the outside, it doesn't look like much, but it was very cute, chairs were comfortable, and it was cozy without being cramped. Bathrooms were spotless.  Right off the bat we ordered wine, our waitress made a recommendation which we happily accepted but then returned to tell us that she had talked to her manager, and he suggested a different one. We went with the second suggestion, I thought it was great that she cared enough to ask for a second opinion. We also ordered a cheese board, the house pickles, the chicken wings (which were the special), and a simple garden salad. The cheese was chosen by our waitress, and she did an excellent job based on what we asked for. Each had a different accompaniment, and the flavors blended so beautifully, we were very impressed. The chicken wings were very tasty, but since we were still hungry, we ordered the salad and it was HUGE! Plenty big to share which was wonderful. The dessert options sounded lovely but we ended up being perfectly full after the salad.  I absolutely LOVE, love, love restaurants like this. Small, intimate, cozy, romantic...places where you graze appies all evening, sipping good wine. The menu is small, which I like, because that tells me that they focus more on the quality of their dishes rather than getting as many half-assed dishes out as fast as they can. Everything I saw on other tables looked amazing. Our server, Natalia, was perfection. She was such a sweet, nice girl - and not in the fake way that waitresses act for a tip - but in a genuine way that tells you she's actually just a nice person. We took our time, enjoying our food and conversation, and never once felt rushed out. I could shout from the rooftops how much I loved it here, and I'm already planning a return trip next weekend! It may be a little pricier than some places, but you absolutely get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Been there several times in the last month. Breakfast is very good,  love the chicken fried steak and the waffles. The service is great! Got the t-bone steak for lunch and it was amazing, great flavor, tender, and only $14. We went there a year ago and it was ok, but now it has gotten so much better. We're going to be going more often. They even give a military discount."}
{"text":"Never again so many things wrong with this place. They took an hour to serve our appetizer and all the food was super salty first and last time honestly"}
{"text":"When I drink my go to food is chicken tenders and fries. It was about 3am on a Saturday when I ordered my meal. I was so excited to eat it so I basically ran to my room. When I got to my room and opened the box I was extremely disaapointed.  Although the fries were good the chicken tenders did not even look like chicken tenders. The breading looked so slimy sort of like the fat you find on the chicken when it's raw. I tried peeling off the \"breading\" but didn't even get finish one piece. I did taste one of their turkey sandwiches beforehand and that made me actually want to go there in the first place, but after those tenders, methinks not."}
{"text":"This place is great! I love how warm and welcoming the atmosphere is, it's so cozy. Another tiny restaurant in Calgary, which I love! You can sit at the bar and watch your food being prepared which is another great thing about Farm!   On Sunday's they have mimosas on special from brunch (which runs till 2pm) so we obviously opted for that. The food is from farms all over Albert and there is actually a map at the front of the store that shows where the farms are located - it's really cool! I opted for the Mac and Cheese because I'd heard from other Yelpers it was amazing, and it definitely didn't disappoint. I liked that it had a little bit of kick to it! The boyfriend wanted the burger but unfortunately they ran out and the table that was seated just before us ordered the last two. This annoyed the boyfriend because we actually arrived at the restaurant before these people so we were surprised when they were seated before us. I guess the hostess was new... still kinda sad that he couldn't try the burger as he had to watch the last two being prepared.   My favorite part would have to be dessert! We split an order of the warm chocolate chip cookies and the macarons! The cookies were so ooey and gooey, just writing about them makes me crave them and I was so happy to find out that had house made macarons! Macarons are my favorite so I couldn't turn these down. The flavors were delicious, and Farm has made it to one of the top spots on my list of places to dine at! You will also receive 10% off your purchase at Janice Beaton Cheese shop next door when you dine here - it's on your receipt so don't throw it out!"}
{"text":"Colour me yum! I stopped in at Farm for lunch after reading some pretty rockin' reviews to date. The space itself is cozy, but cute. There's one large table at the front of the restaurant that's perfect for a large group, otherwise, a few tables of 2 and 4 are nestled up against the wall.  The menu was printed on one sheet of paper, displaying items created from local suppliers. On Emma G's recommendation, I went with the beet salad and shared a cheese plate with my lunchmate.  How does one describe the beet salad? Well, the beets were warm,  served with chevre dressing and topped with greens. The chevre dressing tasted a bit like sour cream to me. Sour cream and beets? OMG, it's borscht! Alright, it's not borscht, but it's a similar flavour combination, and it's one that works very very well.  We had our server pick 3 cheese for us. I wish I could remember the names of the cheeses she chose, because she chose well. The cheese board was served with a few soft pieces of baguette and accompanying foods like olives and a spicy jelly.  All in all, it made for a nice, light lunch. I'll be dreaming about those beats...."}
{"text":"My hubby and I decided to check this place out. We ordered a French dip sandwich with au jus with fries. Easy! The sandwich came with no au jus or horseradish. So first we had to wait for our waiter to come back to our table to get our au jus. Then we were eating out sandwich and realized there was no horseradish on our sandwich so we had to wait again for our waiter to get that. The waitress was nice but that was just unacceptable. The sandwich wasn't that great either."}
{"text":"I had a pasta dish, which was below average.  Cream sauce was flavorless and kielbasa was unappetizing.  However, the fish and chips are above average.  Four large pieces of fish and very filling.  Chips are thin fries. I'd order the fish and chips again, but I'd stay away from the pasta.  So far, this place seems like hit or miss, depending on what you order.  Edit:   1. Tartar sauce comes in packets, as opposed to made fresh.  The freshly made stuff is in the nearby Bistro.   2.  I also tried the gumbo, which is a special this month.  Not good at all relating to both taste and appearance.  Rice was very soggy.  I posted photos of both the fish and chips and gumbo."}
{"text":"Went for charcuterie on Friday with a friend. The server was very friendly and knowledgeable. Food was excellent and exceeded expectations. Pairings were very intentional and well thought out. The atmosphere was perfection."}
{"text":"This review is after 3  visits at different times of the day.  Our first visit was shortly after they'd opened and it was in the morning. Not really impressed. Seating was slow, service was slow with a nearly empty restaurant, so yeah...not too impressed with that. The food was good though. I had the croissant French toast...yummy.  Had to give it another try...this time it was after a concert at Aliante. Well, it was okay. Service was better, but my order was wrong and the coffee was pretty weak.  The next time was for breakfast. We were seated quickly, served in a timely manner and the good was good. French toast for me, pancakes for the hubby...both really good. You have to get meat on the side, but the portion is pretty generous.   All in all you should expect an IHOP or Denny's atmosphere. 24 hour service is a plus. The menu is pretty limited. I noticed that they don't have a kids menu, so beware if you are bringing little ones. The ingredients are mainly locally grown, if at all possible, so that's nice.  I'm a Blueberry Hill lover, but this place is way closer and a reasonable stand-in if I'm not headed toward blueberry hill.  I'm hopeful there will be improvements as time goes on and they get into a good groove.  Now,"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with the family. I was pleasantly surprised, not too crowded on a Saturday morning, the food was GREAT!!! My mimosa was really good ...everything was hot & our waitress was very pleasant. Shantel was AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best food experiences in Calgary so far.  The duck gnocchi paired with the pinot noir was excellent.  Great space.  Casual, warm, but nicely done.  Service was very good, but they were trying a bit too hard on the upsell/add ons.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I got a food voucher from the casino so we decided to try this place. Only a few people in the place. Our server was prompt but didn't speak well. When I asked for egg on my salad, he asked how I wanted the egg. When I said hard boiled, he wrote it down, as if I would have wanted it over easy? The food arrived fairly quickly. I had the salad which was good but I asked for no olives and there were a bunch in there. My husband ordered the grilled turkey sandwich but it was missing the advertised pesto mayo. I also had the pulled pork sliders on a biscuit. First off, it was the smallest slider ever. It was an appetizer so there was only 2. The pork was chunks, not pulled. The sauce was good but the pork was gross. Chewy and flavorless. Yuck. When the waiter asked how everything was, I told him of the issues. I over heard him telling the manager, he returned to ask if I wanted something else. Honestly I'm never eating here again, so no. They took the nasty sliders off the bill and we paid. Never going there ever. I miss OPH!"}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to check out farm! Really awesome little place with some great food. From the farm to fork, its all about local seasonal ingredients sourced from Alberta farms. Just check out the map at the front or in the bathrooms! it shows where the locations are along with little explanations of the farms and the people who run them! Very cool  I came here for lunch! and was quite exited to try the burger special (option #1) this option was a mere 15 dollars! a little 4 course lunch is never a bad thing. Starter was a very simple salad, lightly dressed with little canola seeds,it was a salad! nothing great about it other than the fact it was quite fresh! Then a chipotle cabbage soup with bacon. It was quite good but a little stretched on the ingriedients! Third was the burger which was the best part! They had this house \"spicy ketchup\" which was really tasty , and my burger was medium which is just the way I like it!(though they did not ask us, thats just the way they served mine) The bun was also great! just a good simple burger!   However among the three of us the burgers all were cooked to different doneness levels? so I found that a little strange! but it was still quite delicious! we just kept quite and ate our burgers! hahaha  the dessert was delightful! Two little delicious chocolate chip cookies, which were warm and gooey! What a great way to end lunch!  So farm was awesome overall! Great food,good service great  and a food philosophy which makes a lot of sense. I will be back to eat dinner soon enough! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast. Didn't care too much for the food the table we sat at was dirty. We asked the hostess if we can move and she said yes and then just walked away so we went and sat at a table. The waitress wasn't too friendly either. I can say this coffee was good"}
{"text":"Love this place! We visited the cafe for the 1st time when we stayed at the hotel for our anniversary. Since moving to the area in July 2015, we eat here at least twice a week. My wife ALWAYS orders their croissant french toast (for breakfast, lunch or dinner). I've tried a variety of items (country fried steak, club sandwich, pot pie, fried chicken, apple pie) and they've all been good. Request Melissa as your server if she's working. She is very efficient and makes our visit to the farm pleasureable!!!!"}
{"text":"Over 10 mins to be greeted ... no drinks yet  Evelyn very sweet girl . Knowledgeable and quick  She's very good with talking to guest"}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome!! Surprisingly affordable when compared to some of the other meals we had while in Calgary and Banff and definitely affordable when compared to comparable restaurants in the NYC area. Food here is fresh, creative, and seasonable. We were so impressed with the meat and cheese charcuterie platter...absolutely top notch! I recommend sitting by the bar as you can watch the chefs work. The local micro brew beer offerings at the Farm are great and dessert is not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Upon walking in the door, I was surprised at how small the restaurant is, but it is well decorated and cozy.  Our table of eight sat close, but it was comfortable and made visiting easy.  I have never been served by someone so knowledgeable, particularly about a complex menu that continuously changes, in my entire life.  This server alone deserves five stars.  She spent the time our entire table of eight needed to have all of our questions answered, which were many.  She was very thorough and smiled throughout it all.  I shared a cutting board with two others.  We ordered two cheeses (not familiar to me) and three meats, being some sort of peppery sausage (can't remember the crazy name), chorizo sausage and buffalo.  This was accompanied by slices of baguette, olives, walnuts, pickled asparagus, jelly and a dip similar to dijon mustard.  Everything was extremely flavorful and truly incredible.  I do wish there would have been more bread for us and more food.  $25 seemed a bit high for the amount we received but again, the quality was undeniable.  All three of us considered it pricey, two of us were really excited about the food.    As a main, I ordered the mac n' cheese with the pork as a recommended addition.  Hands down the best I've ever had.  It is a rich dish and very filling.  It appeared to be a small portion but I couldn't finish it all.  I thought the price was very reasonable for this.  My spouse also ordered it but wasn't excited about it, just as he felt about the cutting board.  I sampled his order of chef's potatoes which were about average.  Others thought they were fantastic.      I only drank water but in reading the beer selection, I thought the prices were good.  Truly, I'd give Farm four stars because of what I'd consider higher prices for the portion sizes (primarily related to the cutting board), but the quality of food and service overrides this and definitely deserves five stars."}
{"text":"We headed here on a Sunday afternoon at an in between time.   They had a very scarce menu available, but we were starved.   I had a salad, he had the mac and cheese, we shared the charcuterie and a peanut butter pot.   The food was definitely a 6.5/10, good but not AMAZING. Wine selection was ok as well. Service was blah and the place seemed like it needed a shut down for a good and proper scrubbing - a little dirty.   I don't think I would return, but it's not the worst option on 17th avenue by far."}
{"text":"This place really need to step there game up.  The service is horrible and you gotta wait forever for your food and the place isn't even empty.  All I'm saying is step your training program up and make it enjoyable for locals....."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best mac and cheese on 17 Avenue. Great selection of cheese at the back. This is what buy local is all about."}
{"text":"[This review best sung to \"Take me out to the ballgame\"]  Take me out to the Cal-gary... Take me out to the burbs.  Buy me cul de sacs and winding streets I don't know if there's anything to eat   Cuz it's root root root for the gastro team Nothing for them in Cal-garyyyy  But wait there's one, two three reasons to eat At the Farm in Cal-ga-ryyyy!  One - chacuterie Two - local organic produce Three - service that brings you out  At the Farm restaurant!!!  [End song]  Seriously -- I have been coming to Calgary on business for 8 years and have long been confined to the tasty but overpriced downtown eateries which are best served on an expense account. Work your way over to Farm for Calgary's answer to Toronto's Jamie Kennedy wine bar. The menu is ever-changing and consistently good.  It's MOO-Liscious!"}
{"text":"Excelente! Muy rico y sabroso limpio agradable con casino! Para apostar y disfrutar de las vegas"}
{"text":"Always a great breakfast!  Went for Mother's Day and the waitresses were super nice & friendly.  We go here a lot and it's always a good eat! Farm to table is how we should all eat."}
{"text":"I love Farm so much I might as well be born in a barn!   This adorable cheese shop and restaurant, located on 17th Ave has been a fave of mine for years. They have a serious commitment to buying local meats, cheeses and produce - they even have a map at the front door! The menu is always fantastic. The staff is so lovely. And the decor is adorable!   Over the years, I have always made an effort to pop in for lunch, when I am in Calgary. But recently I went in for a (very late) brunch. I was so happy to see that they serve on Sundays all day long. Past 2pm it is a limited menu, but trust me, it is still fantastic. And, the pie de resistance: $6 mimosas all day long on Sunday!! Woo woo. Colour me impressed. And they are really good mimosas too.   From Farm to Table, to a table at Farm... it doesn't get much better!"}
{"text":"5 stars because staff is always so nice and if you're in the mood for some breakfast other than Denny's or ihop, this is the place to be and prices aren't bad either"}
{"text":"It has good breakfast food, however, I wish they had more vegetarian options. This is a great place, and the word has got out. Expect to wait 30 min for Sunday breakfast. Everyone is really nice. I recommend the build your own omelet, and the french toast with berries is delicious too."}
{"text":"Server did not listen. 2 of us for dinner. 1 ordered soup I ordered teriyaki chicken. Soup came out. 20 minutes later we got my Chicken. Wanted served together . PEOPLE DO NOT LISTEN . Payed for soup not for Chicken. Did not want"}
{"text":"Farm had great food. A perfect mingling of nice, original flavours. It feels like they work at thinking about food in original ways, like a chef would. We ate the Mac n cheese, so good. Cheesy, a blend of strong and creamy flavours, great texture. A nice breadcrumb topping sealed the heat and went so well with the cheesy hot insides.   The lunch special sandwich were lamb meatballs on a panini roll and it was so good. The salad was delicate, flavoured with a perfectly balanced vinaigrette and mustard seeds, I just wanted more.   The only thing we didn't like was the homemade ginger beer or ginger drink. One sip each and neither of us enjoyed the flavour, or temperature, or the flatness. Was boring. We said so and our waitress took it back, thank goodness, she seemed new.   Now for the coffee. It was so good we asked where to buy the beans and then walked around the corner to buy the beans nearby from a cool coffee shop.   Farm was delicious. Would love to go back."}
{"text":"Not much to say besides this place offers basic café/diner food. Think a little more expensive Denny's in a casino. I have had the BLT sandwich and also tried the patty melt... both sandwiches are better if you go to Johnny Rockets a few feet away. They did have really good potato salad. But overall average place.. don't go out of your way to come and try."}
{"text":"From the rave reviews I was expecting a wonderful meal. I chose the cod with cabbage and mandarins. Very disappointing! Served lukewarm, spongy, tasteless cod and some cabbage and wild rice for $27. My friend ordered the cod special and was disappointed that it was such a small dish. Our server offered desserts on the house. The peanut butter pot  de creme was rich and delicious as was the chai carrot cake. However, I don't think I'll be back, there are many better places to dine."}
{"text":"I loved the brunch here!! The Benny's are delicious!! And the coffee is really good!! In addition, the service was very friendly.. It is a good idea to make resos for Sundays, as the place is busy... I definitely recommend brunch here as I really enjoyed it!!"}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Wine, Great Friends.  What more can you ask for from a dining experience.  My friends and I had a great meal.  We had a great bottle of cabernet, which was a perfect recommendation from our waiter.  We started with a plate of local cheeses, which were all amazing. Then we had some mac and cheese (who doesn't love mac and cheese), as well as the salmon and cole slaw.  Everything was great, with a few exceptions.  We finished off our meal with a great dessert of sugar pie... mmmmm!  I definitely recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"The food is mediocre. Had to wait 15 mins to be seated in a empty restaurant.  Took 30 mins to get my food. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Service is terrible! Staff is poorly trained and management is rude. The chicken strips are clearly frozen,  not fresh."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today for breakfast. My husband and I both thought the food was great! I had the Farm Skillet and he had eggs and ham. The ham steak was delicious and the veggies in my skillet were fresh and perfectly cooked. The service was excellent and everyone was friendly. We plan to return soon. Based on the reviews, I guess I need to try the cookie ... Next time!"}
{"text":"This is the place my mom and I would eat at when she comes into town, drags me out at 1224am on a week night because she promises to only drop 100 dollars on the pennies, and I don't know how much money later...but now she's hungry. After typing that out, I'm thinking she was stress eating after a night of gambling. Lol.   Anyway, considering we've come in during the time of week and night where normal people would be asleep because they work in the morning...it's fairly slow. Some nights if we get there earlier like at 918pm, there's certainly a mild amount of customers in there. Either way, we've always experienced great customer service.   The food...3.5 stars. Just regular pub/ihop type eatery and pricing. I will openly admit this place popped my croissant french toast cherry. So naturally, I was excited to eat it and thoroughly enjoyed it. Of all the dishes we have had together there.. there wasn't any fancy shmancy garnishment for aesthetics...I kind of wish they'd throw something on there for embellishment because the dishes always looked sad.  Hahhaa.  Their menu isn't very extensive so don't expect it. I kind of prefer non-extensive menus because I can get so dang indecisive. If none of the restaurants within the casino as well as their food court tickles your senses...Farm isn't that bad of a place to settle for as your last resort. We always tend to take home the leftovers because they do serve a good portion, in my opinion. I also appreciate their support for locally grown fresh food.  Nothing to shoot across town for. You aren't missing out on anything spectaular. But will recommend them as an.option while in the vicinity.  The restaurant itself is definitely kid and stroller friendly. Also, you don't have to navigate too into the casino incase you loathe bringing your kids in because of the smell. Do not enter through any of the entrances  if you're facing the front of the casino. Rather, use the side entrance right before the ramp into the parking garage as that will lead you quicker to the restaurant. I suck at directions, but you definitely won't get lost.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I wasn't impressed with what the menu had to offer when I viewed it online, but I had no choice but to go because of my girlfriends best friends birthday, but what the heck mine as well keep an open mind :)   When I entered the restaurant, I was quite impressed with the decor. They do a great job of selling the whole \"Farm\" theme from the tea cups that they use for candle holders, to the clothing line bulletin board located at the front where they promos/ads using clothing pins.   Our waitress was quite knowledgeable and she was able to point me in the right direction :). I ended up ordering the Mac and Cheese and I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Even my girlfriend who's not a huge fan of Mac and Cheese couldn't stop picking at my dish. I also ordered the Chef's potatoes as well, which wasn't too bad.   I wasn't a huge fan of the portion size, the Mac and Cheese was quite small, but a few people at our table ordered the Bacon Salad and the portions seemed quite generous."}
{"text":"I am from San Francisco where amazing local food is more than bounty-full and this was by far the best locavore restaurant I've ever been to. Our server was so sweet and the ambiance was very homey. we loved the candle lit porcine cups & special spoons with dessert. Best dishes are the signature mac and cheese, get it as an appie for the table and the crispy duck was AMAZING!!  My mom visiting wants to come back from California just for her next birthday!  Thanks Farm for renewing my faith in Calgary ;)"}
{"text":"I've never been there for dinner, only lunch and brunch. As far as brunch goes, their bennies are pretty good and hardy! Definitely love the side salad as I feel like it's pretty light and refreshing when it's paired with a rich benny. My boyfriend loved getting the breakfast hash and said it's one of the best he's had! The menu is pretty straight forward and simple, which I could see some people complaining that there's not a lot of variety. But I find that sometimes it's easier to make a decision if there aren't a lot of options.  When it comes to lunch, my go-to is usually the chicken sandwich and it's again paired with their muse salad. I believe I've had their pulled pork before and I think I remember the BBQ sauce being a little too sweet for me. It was good for the first couple of bites, but I just gave the left over to my boyfriend as he loves pulled pork. They have a daily feature which also provides a nice variety to their menu. I've also heard very good things about the mac n' cheese, although I have not personally tried it. I do recommend getting the ice tea as well, it's very refreshing on a spring/summer afternoon.  As Farm is paired with Janice Beacon Fine cheese, I highly recommend you get a cheese/meat board. I'm not really a cheese condenseur, all I know is that I love cheese. If you don't really know too much like me, I'd honestly just ask for recommendations and the staff there are really helpful and knowledgeable in explaining  the flavour profile of the cheese if you have a general idea of what you like. Their tomato chili jam is unreal and pairs well with practically anything.  You can either get a selection of 3, 5 or 7. I would say if you're extra hungry, a 5 choice selection is a pretty decent starter between 2 people.  Be careful! It's easy to fill up on bread. All in all, the cheese is unreal and I give this place 5/5 just for the cheese board.  The indoor décor is chic and modern, with a farm-like feel to it. It's a super cute place to go for a first date in my opinion."}
{"text":"Really surprised by some of the other reviews - I rather liked this place. Food was very fresh, menu was just right, and service was friendly. My meal was quite tasty.  I like the idea of a restaurant focusing on local fare, and was impressed to see a place inside Aliante taking the chance to offer this to its eaters."}
{"text":"I loved the quality of the food.  Great place to take good friends over for some quality time together.  A bit pricey if you love to eat in quantity."}
{"text":"This is the first time I ever check in using yelp but been to this farm cafe many times inside the Aliante casino! Long story short last time I was here with my family ordered several foods and the food comes out everything was ok tasting but the worst part they mess up my lady veggies, the manager comes out and said SORRY! A few mins later the check comes with everything we ordered on the check, the manager on duty never take out the mistake food off the check!!! Then tonight we decided to eat at the Farm again since we staying the night at Aliante casino then this time we pretty much preferred the same food minus the kids food. I ordered country fried steak with egg over easy then finally the food comes out they had my eggs over cook to the point where the yolk is not even runny anymore so I told the server I don't want it and to send it. Then again the manager named: Anamarie that working graveyard shift again said I'm sorry for the mistake food. I'm so mad I straight up told her sorry doesn't do me any good!!! THE WORST EVER! I'm done with this farm cafe/24 hours restaurant inside the Aliante casino!!!!"}
{"text":"A satisfying experience from start to finish, an absolute gem on the famed 17th avenue in Calgary.  I was rolling solo, so asked to sit at the bar and even though it looked like there were spots I was asked to wait a few minutes - no big deal, and worth it as I was seated right in the center where the 3 chefs were plating each dish before handing off to the servers.  The staff was great, my server was attentive and provided me her input as to her favorite dishes and was honest about what she had not tried.  She also helped recommend a cheese based on my preference (sheep!).  Food wise....exquisite;  Started with Torlese Sauvignon Blanc and prosciutto and shepard's harvest sheep cheese.  I later told the waitress I was a bit hesitant ordering prosciutto in Canada because this meat is religion in North Jersey where I'm from, and I've recently been in Spain where even in back alley places you get slices of heaven - their stuff holds up against my high standards, and the cheese was very good, complimented with a fruit jam and sliced apples or fig - very nice plate.  For dinner had the lamb special which came with green beans and a rectangular butter nut squash cake topped with kalletes.   The lamb, topped with a delicious spread of some nut (ugh, hate that I cannot remember, I think pistachio), did not look award winning when it was put in front of me to be honest.  But with each bite it just got better and better, an excellent cut of meat and well prepared.  A meal like that required desert, and the pot de creme with salted ganache topping was insanely good - and a perfect portion size.  The name speaks for the quality of the food, all from local Alberta farms so expect the menu to change a bit but I have no doubt that you will get a memorable dish any day of the year.  I will without a doubt be back, and thanks to head chef Chris for the extra desert cookie!"}
{"text":"Didn't expect it to be so good. We both had the chicken fried steak and potatoes. Really good! Didn't taste like prepackaged garbage. We'll definitely be back, next time for breakfast. Our server was attentive and the food arrived in a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"Had my first meal at the Farm in the Aliante Casino today. I ordered the turkey platter which consisted of turkey breast, mashed potatoes, stuffing and a carrot and pea combination with a side order of green beans. I may have ordered something too complicated. The turkey breast was very dry and the gravy might have been used to hide this flaw. The side order of green beans was delivered about ten minutes after the main meal was served and was chewy and tasteless..Perhaps they were not cooked by simply microwaved. The green beans and turkey breast served at the Medley Buffet are certainly better, at least in my opinion. I am not sure why this place suggests that things are farm fresh as there seemed to be no evidence of that. When considering the eating options at the Aliante Casino, the food court can deliver better and consistent quality. It has been said that first impressions count the most. Unfortunately, this first impression was not good at all. This is probably going to be my first and last meal at the Farm"}
{"text":"This is the new 24-hour café at the Aliante Casino & Hotel in North Las Vegas.  Besides being conveniently open 24/7, breakfast is served all day, and there is a large variety of comfort food choices on the menu, from a Meatloaf Tower and Country Fried Steak to Chicken Pot Pie and specialty sandwiches.  I found the Prime Rib Dip, served on a French roll, to be fairly good, with lean but not noticeably seasoned meat, and a very good au jus.  But no listed Horseradish Sauce was presented, and Diane's Bacon Cheeseburger was overcooked.  All sandwiches and many other items come with a choice of french fries, house made cole slaw, or homemade potato salad.  I found the potato salad to be very tasty and somewhat unusual, composed of Redskin Potatoes, celery, egg, and some creamy dressing to hold the concoction together.  Service was friendly, proficient, and professional.  Requested ketchup and cocktail sauce were both brought to our table quickly.  Prices, too, are quite reasonable, for adequate portions of food.  3-1/2 stars overall on this initial outing!  This place just opened.  I have high hopes for it, since it is close to where I live and offers much promise."}
{"text":"I will only eat here if you're paying. Enough said...the place is always cold... and the food is haphazardly served in varying portion sizes; I'm assuming they don't want to make more if what they've got on hand will do"}
{"text":"I want to give FARM 3 and a HALF Stars, but sadly, Yelp doesn't have halfs!  FARM is an adorable little restaurant on 17th Ave.  The quality of the ingredients seem very good, and the prices seem decent.  Visited the restaurant for lunch as part of the \"Big Taste.\"  Jessica and I split one of each of the two options (which were slightly different; one was $15 and one was $25).  The salad that came with the more expensive option had with walnuts, aged cheddar and pickled onions; the other: more simple with greens and canola seeds. Both were pretty good (obviously one with cheese/nuts being better!) but nothing really to write home about.  We each got a burger with our meal, although one had cheese and bacon and the other didn't. Each was again, good, but not mind-blowing in anyway. To be honest, the cheese and bacon didn't really seem to make much of a difference. The bacon was not crispy, but seemed almost steamed or boiled. Not really noticeable.   The main problem with the burgers was that (out of the 3 of us that dined together) all the burgers were COMPLETELY different doneness.  Kenny's was medium-well, mine was rare and Jessica's was nearly seared tartare!  I have no doubt that the quality of the meat was good, so this does not concern me from a health standpoint, but that they had no consistancy and there was no word of warning, like, \"We cook our burgers rare because dah, dah-dah, dah-dah ...\" Strange.  The desserts we had were excellent.  Their warm cookies are so delicious and comforting, and the \"gingerbread parfait\" with apples (though teeny tiny) was extremely well balanced and tasty.  I am curious to try FARM again. I liked the decor, I liked the concept, and I would be interested to see how I would feel after a 2nd visit."}
{"text":"The hostesses are a poor first impression to the restaurant.  Very busy chatting and they make you feel as though you are bothering them.  The wait was about 10 minutes which is typical.  Our waiter was very busy but  attentive.  The food was good but nothing spectacular.  We ordered burgers and fries so we didn't expect to be blown away.  It's okay for a weekend lunch but I would not bring visiting friends or family."}
{"text":"Customer service was beyond expectations.  Alex was very friendly and attentive to me and my husbands needs.  She made sure to ask us if everything was okay and kept checking on us to make sure we had everything we need.  She was really nice and extremely helpful.  Definitely made this restaurant stand out from the others.   A tip wasn't suffice for the service she provided for us.  She definitely gave us a five star experience :)"}
{"text":"We were driving by and saw the sign. So we were excited to try!  My sexy wife and I always said they need a good cafe in Aliante. Now they have one. It's in the spot where the Original Pancake House used to be.   Service is very friendly and a tad slow.  That's ok though, they just opened yesterday!    Our waiter \"Jesus\" was awesome and he split our French Toast in two because he knew we were sharing!   We ordered the Denver omelet, Vanilla French toast and country farm skillet!   Everything came out nice and fresh and was good to almost really good!  I think it will get better with time!   We will be back for sure and are excited to try the Lunch and Dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Oh where to start. My husband and I were at the casino and decided to grab some food. Due to the time of night Farm was 1 of 2 options. I have had a bad experience there before bit figured it could happen again, right? Wrong. We're were sat right away and began looking over the menu when the waitress asked if we need some time. We said yeah give us a few minutes. She took our drink orders and went to get them. By the time she got back we were ready to order my husband ordered country fried steak and eggs and I ordered the chicken stir fry and fried pickles as an appetizer which came out very quickly. They were so salty we could barely eat them. So we asked for some ranch dressing to dip them in. The waitress came back about 10 minutes later and apologized it took so long and that she had to go to another restaurant to get it. About 30-40 minutes later our food came out. My husband's gravy had what looked to be raw bacon in it and the steak wasn't cooked right. I cut up my chicken and noticed that the vegetables were still raw. I asked the waitress if this is stir fry because it had 3 pieces of chicken about 3 inch. long and a scoop of rice and the rest of the bowl was full of broccoli and 3 slices of carrots  (all raw). She apologized and took it back to the kitchen to have them remake it. After another 20 minutes she brings me my food. So I start to inspect it. It appeared that whoever cooked it decided to pour water in my bowl and stick it in the microwave because the bowl was completely water logged but hot. As I cut open the chicken I notice that it was raw in the center. My husband stood up to go talk to the manager that was standing by the register after about 5 minutes. A waitress, not even the one that had been helping is came to the tabl and asked if everything was ok. I told her the issue and she asked if the manager had been over. I told her no and got up to join my husband where we stood for another 10 minutes before my husband got upset and asked if they were going to even knowledge that we were standing there. The manager said yeah I'm fixing it bill and handed to the cashier and walked away. We will never go there again. 2 separate times I have had raw food. Make sure u check urs."}
