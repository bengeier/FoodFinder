{"text":"We had a terrible visit at Dino's My 83 year old mother became very sick after eating your food. She spent two days in our hotel room suffering so i called her DR in California. We came close to going to the ER but decided to follow her Nurses Instructions. The hotel had to help us with her as she couldn't get up . Shame on you all for selling such awe full food to customers, shes 83!! The hotel had to help us get her to our car to get her home . Four hour drive to get home to California this ruined our vacation ."}
{"text":"We went to Fremont Street and we were starving! We walked in to the first available eatery and it happend to be one of the greatest food experiences of our lives! We had the Chinese cuisine: the server was hilarious and was very friendly and outgoing. The food itself was more than enough to keep me coming back! Very large portions and every morsel was a tantalizing delight. We loved it and highly recommend.  Hopefully the tacos and pizza will be as good as the Chinese food for the next time we come to Vegas! 
P.s. No veggies in Vegas!"}
{"text":"If you love ramen avoid this place at all costs. The ramen is completely tasteless and the \"toppings\" are cheap Chinese food. Gross."}
{"text":"FILTHY.  All of the open tables are disgusting, greasy, and in need of cleaning. Ordered food and immediately lost my appetite. Should have trusted my eyes and instinct. Skip this joint."}
{"text":"I ordered a burrito and stepped outside to listen to a street performer. Tried to come back in to use the restroom and they wouldn't let me. Burrito was subpar. Not a place I would recommend."}
{"text":"This place is dirty, staff is rude. There are better places to eat just keep walking you will be better off. Even their signs are rude."}
{"text":"Asian food left a bad aftertaste that stayed with me for the rest of the day. Mexican place had really good customer service but food wasn't all that great."}
{"text":"tacos are shitt.  the condiments or not left outside where you can put your own add-ons. the steak taco meat had no flavor. bland. lady at the counter had no personality. fuk this place. never again!"}
{"text":"I use this place like a fast food way station.  If you're hanging on Fremont Street, you're on a journey.  Pop in here and grab a quick bite to eat to tide yourself over in-between destinations.  

If it's early in the evening, just get the single soft taco of your choice (made from an assortment of barnyard animals and their parts) while you're on the go.  If it's late, you might go for the three taco plate with a dollop of rice and beans for under $8. The tacos are relatively small and are \"street\" sized.  And, if you need more beer, they serve it.       

This isn't epic Mexican food, but it quickly gets the job done at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"As a local downtown, I'm always looking for new places to eat. I happened to stumble across this place and wow. 

At first thought, it has a mall food court feel. Multiple genre of foods which is served quickly. I been here on multiple occasion and every time, I am never disappointed. I had the ramen and burrito there. Flavors are excellent for the price. Definitely a place to check out if you're balling on a budget."}
{"text":"Excellent food for takeaway. Can sit down and eat as well if you prefer that. Right in the middle of Fremont street. Good selection of different items. 
Got the orange chicken the BBQ chicken with the fried rice and loved them. Tasty, tangy with just the right amounts of spice."}
{"text":"Had some good pizza and bourbon chicken in here.  Prices are reasonable. Overall good choice, and quick!"}
{"text":"This is on Fremont Street and if you can get in when it is busy, then yay you.  It is the kind of place where you can get pizza, from counter or chinese from another, etc.

We found that the prices were reasonable but that the food looked a lot better than it actually tasted.  Especially the pizza.  What we had looked amazing.  The taste and quality of the pizza was nowhere near amazing, hence the three stars.

The place was half clean and half trashed.

Service was meh.

there was a sign that basically said don't leave you kids there while you go to the casinos to have fun..."}
{"text":"Mexican, Chinese, pizza and smoothies all under one dinky little roof.  There's nothing special about this place. It's open late at night and easy access off Freemont street. The burrito was huge and tasted awesome. The Chinese food was pretty good too but just average selection for a hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Yesterday I ate Mexican.  I ordered marinated chicken taco plate with spicy beans rice, spicy red sauce and a Mexican coke.  The beans were very good.  They had a spicy taste.  The tacos were good too.  CHECK THIS PLACE OUT."}
{"text":"This place sucks dude! I got a burrito and they had no sour cream not that much options and to top it off double charge in prices. This place was meant to charge people double prices in standards to foreign visitors coming elsewhere. Place seemed sketch, u can do better."}
{"text":"While walking along the Fremont Street Experience I noticed the International Eatery food court.  It is located in the Neonopolis building across of Wall greens.  On Tuesday night I walked into the food court for dinner and noticed the pizza booth, the Chinese booth, and the Mexican booth.  I opted to try the Mexican booth. Other customers came into the eatery and they opted for the pizza booth as well as the Mexican booth. The workers at the Chinese booth was luring customers with free samples of pork or chicken to gain business.

As I was looking at the menu items at DJ's Tacos I noticed MENUDO and asked the server what it is in menudo.  He told me that menudo consisted of tripe and corn.  I told the server that I have been a fan of MENUDO the music group and that I never had menudo the dish. He then offered me a sample of menudo the dish. 

I ordered my menudo dish as well as the tacos. Can't go wrong on $2.00 taco. Since there were three small tacos I asked for three different meat fillings. Chicken, pork, and beef with mild sauce topped with lettuce and cheese (there are other topping ingredients for individuals who want more on the tacos).  I also ordered a large beverage drink to go with my meal. 

Since the International Eatery is a food court I checked out the public restroom. Both the men and women restrooms are locked and individuals need codes to access the restroom.  I received the code from the server at the Mexican booth. Once I opened the restroom I noticed that the floor was littered in certain spots with paper towel and toilet paper. The toilet stall that I ended up using was out of toilet paper. Really??!?? No toilet paper....loose money. Some previous customers even left their cup drinks on the floor and sink area of the restroom.

Overall it was an average food court with little food booths to choose from.  I just wish the janitors would check up on the restroom area more often."}
{"text":"I came here when they first opened and I can't tell you how happy I was.

While at work, I get cravings for some Chinese food & Chinamax provides that for me.

I love their fried rice, bourbon chicken and egg rolls. 

There are two other restaurants in here, a Mexican place & American food station.

Now, I haven't eaten at the Mexican place but I did have a pizza slice that was amazing! Topping tasted fresh and the portion is good for the price.

This review is about the Chinese food. I had recommended this place to my coworkers and they agreed, this eatery has good Chinese food and the price is just right.

The service is friendly, and specialty dishes are made to order.

If you find yourself in downtown Fremont, this food court is centrally located in the beginning of the Fremont experience & know that for a low cost, you can get your Chinese food cravings, Mexican, or Mexican dishes in one place.

There is also seating available inside with air conditioning to keep you cool from the Las Vegas heat.

Recently opened is also a juicery stand to get refreshing blended Boba or fruit juice to keep you refreshed as you explore Fremont.

Enjoy!

{"text":"The food is actually good considering there is a variety of food like pizza, noodles and carne asada fries. I had the carne asada fries and they were delicious. I would definitely recommend they are a must. They use real meat."}
{"text":"Okay, this is no 5-star restaurant but it's awesome in it's own right.  We landed on Fremont Street for a night of debauchery, and just wanted to put a little food in our bellies first- definitely NOT a night for a buffet or that much food!  Did I mention there were 10 of us?  I drug the group to this place with my fingers crossed that it would please everyone and it did!  The Chinese was outstanding given that it was tasty, cheap, and quick!  The staff is super friendly, sampling their food, and generally overall just giving off a positive vibe!  Some folks got the pizza as well, and said it was awesome!  Try the Bourbon Chicken and Orange Chicken combo, YUMO!"}
{"text":"Husband and I ate at the food court that was American food. He had pizza and I had a hamburger. Both were really good and the prices were much less than other food eateries. Will definitely go back during this visit."}
{"text":"The Mexican food place in this eatery had the worst service I have ever experienced. I will never go back here again, and I suggest you don't either."}
{"text":"We were hungry  and said \"let's go to international, they have variety\"... bad idea!!!
Cheeseburger combo plate $10 
Charred on the outside and dry inside...
Our friends Two slices of pep pizza $9
Reheated so much it was burned...
My boyfriends Philly cheesesteak was good. The fries sucked lol. Another friend went to the Mexican restaurant for carne Asada fries and they're out of fries. So burrito it was...
Tables dirty and no ranch sides or ketchup in site :(
Not coming back."}
{"text":"I ate the Chinese food here, as it was moderately priced- 2 entrees and a starch for $8. But the food was covered in a syrupy sauce that plagues Americanized Chinese food and the noodles were pretty bland. I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"They closed their restroom preventing their paying customers from using it. Isnt this a health code violation?"}
{"text":"Loved their food and price range .. but the man from pizza shop charged us $1 in cash for refilling coke .."}
{"text":"Had a quesadilla from the Mexican spot and it was a ridiculously huge portion. Flavor of the steak was great too."}
{"text":"For sure you will seat on top of someone mess, they don't clean tables often, and their promotions of 3 tacos /1 beer is not really explain so they'll give you what ever meet they'll want or left out"}
{"text":"I live downtown, and have stopped by the Eatery many times.  The food is delicious.  Everything is made fresh, and it is affordable.  Decent size portions too.  Would def recommend the Tacos or Burrito!"}
{"text":"So I was out playing poker at the Golden Nugget and wanted something quick. I walked past this place and was immediately drawn in. I mean come on, where else can you get Asian and Mexican cuisine under one roof and from first glance everything is made fresh! I tried the tacos and a few Asian chicken dishes. Both dishes had the flavor of something you'd expect from an authentic Spanish or Asian restaurant. Prices were very reasonable for the amount of food you get. Anyone close to Fremont St. needs to visit. Something for everyone and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food is mediocre but what really turned me off was the behavior of the employees. We ordered udon from the other counter and were told there would be a 3 minute wait.  Mind you we had gotten there roughly 15 minutes before 11pm.  When we looked to find a seat we were greeted with empty tables with no seats. There were 2 male employees that as guests stood up they would collect their seats leaving patrons like us that had just ordered food to stand around. No cares about the people that just ordered, only caring about getting things cleaned up and going home. This continued all the way till they locked the doors. We were lucky enough to grab a seat when a couple stood up to leave but there was a family standing around a table attempting to eat their meal. What ever happened to customer service?  Guess seeing be going back."}
{"text":"It was my first time going to experience Fremont downtown. Upon exiting the parking lot into Freemont led us right to the entrance of SLOTZILLA. Right next to Slotzilla is the international Eatery. My family and I were hungry so we decided to eat there because of their worldly choices. I decided to try to Mexican food because they offered San Diego Style Carne Asada Fries. Let me tell you, I was not let down at all. This is by far the best carne asada style fries ive had outside of San Diego. 
I would recommend this place to all my friends that visit downtown Las Vegas.

Things to try: Carne Asada Fries"}
{"text":"I haven't tried all the places they're my two favorite is the pizza parlor and the Mexican food I like that they have different varieties of meats and different sauces that you can put on the Mexican food and the burritos are really really big the meats are very delicious and very tender"}
{"text":"NASTY DIRTY UUUG !!! 
And all employees don't care is like the food curt at the mall but in thus place no one's is there to clean tables n the floor
My date try the tacos  no flavor just really spice ....
And I got an orange chicken sample Nada same 
Omg ... just there for the drunk sheep tourist that don't want to go to a real eatery ...lol"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. The food is over priced, old and dried out. The employees are rude. Just don't do it. I'm a local and just wanted something different. Go to the cafe at Binions."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of this place. I have eaten at each of the counters within the International eatery, and was not impressed at any of them. 

The Italian food was reheated. I ordered pizza, and the server had burned the crust, but still served it to me. When I asked for a different piece, the next one was lukewarm coming \"right out of the oven\". I'm assuming the burned piece was to get the pizza to temperature when reheating it. Either way, totally gross.

The Mexican counter is okay, and definitely the better of the 3. I had a burrito, which was humongous and impossible to eat by hand. It was bursting at the seems and quickly fell apart. But at least it tasted good after I asked for a plate and fork. The server was...less than stellar. And their soda machine was broken of all the drinks except water or lemonade. I wish I had known this before ordering a combo and realizing my options were very limited. 

The Chinese food was not the business. I grabbed a plate to-go so I could take it with me on my lunch break. I stuck to my usual staples at a Chinese restaurant. But the meat (both the chicken and beef) was extremely fatty and off-putting. I ended up throwing it out, and my money down the drain. 

Now that the company I work for has moved two blocks further away, I don't feel the need to make the walk to grab some food from this place, as there are definitely better places to eat. I guess it was take it or leave it after all."}
