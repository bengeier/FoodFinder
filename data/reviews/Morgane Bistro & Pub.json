{"text":"Belle terrasse  à l'arrière  avec un autre petit pub.  La bouffe est correcte.  Évitez la crêpe  provençale aux crevettes.  Elle est vite détrempée. Service ok."}
{"text":"Two-and-a-half years later and this is still a great place to eat! Just like others, we arrived and the place was full (a good sign). After about 20 minutes at the bar were shown to our table.   NOTE: menus here are only in French (bring your dictionary or smartphone). The staff is extremely helpful and bilingual. They will be very glad if you at least attempt to order or respond in French. However, they can translate the menu for you and answer all your questions without pause.   The kitchen was a tad slow, but that just gave us more time to enjoy the ambience. Go after sunset and the patio trees will be illuminated. Lovely.   The crowd is pleasant and not too noisy. The prices are reasonable (C$75 incl. tip for two diners). Flavors are sumptuous, better even than anything we tried in Montreal today. I particularly recommend \"le croque monsieur\" and the Nutella crêpe. The calamari and my wife's salmon filet were also great.   The beer is fresh and whiskeys are plentiful. The menu isn't quite as diverse as we expected for a \"gastropub,\" but everything we had was still delicious.   Seriously considering a return visit before we leave town in a few days. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal here at the Bistro.  When we arrived, they were full, but sent us to the pub in back and we had a nice drink in the patio.  30 minutes later we were in the bistro and had wonderful Moules Frites and a Croque Monsieur.  The service is very friendly and it was fun stumbling through my high school French.  Wonderful time and great food."}
