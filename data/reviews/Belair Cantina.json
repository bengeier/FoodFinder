{"text":"Went during the first week of opening. They smartly brought in staff from Milwaukee locations to help with the new restaurant. Free chips and three dipping options when you sit down are tasty. There seems to be a lot of daily specials for food, happy hour specials for drinks! Shrimp burritos flavorful and chicken and barbacoa tacos alike were excellent. Lots of helpful staff making sure waters were filled and guests were taken care of, even though it was pretty busy. So excited to return and try more of the extensive menu!"}
{"text":"I was there with a party of 5. Food ok, no one was disappointed. Fish taco was a bit overcooked and spicy but ok overall."}
{"text":"Went here around Labor Day for dinner.  It's definitely not a pleasant atmosphere for dinner.  It's incredibly bright and the tables are packed together and full of college students in badgers gear.   The chips and salsa were good, the queso was really boring-wouldn't order it again. The server described it as \"like Qdoba, but better.\"  As for the food, the prices were good since it was taco Tuesday, but the tacos were very mediocre. Worst of all, I ordered a portobello mushroom taco and it came out with korean beef (and queso, so clearly someone in the kitchen thought it was the mushroom and prepared it that way) instead of mushroom.  The server didn't notice, and I didn't notice until I looked closely. I'm glad I am not a vegetarian, because this is a huge kitchen mistake. The server said she would bring me a new one, and comp the taco. She did bring me a new one, but ended up charging me for the wrong taco as well as the replacement. It took several discussions with her for her to understand how the bill should have been. Overall, the tacos were disappointing and the ambiance was definitely not a place for adults/families.  Definitely more of a hot spot for college kids."}
{"text":"As much as I enjoyed the location, decor, outdoor seating and concept, I was sadly underwhelmed by everything else. We waited a long while once seated before anyone offered to take our drink order. Service was slow and the food was mediocre. I ordered three tacos; carnitas, shrimp and mahi-mahi and none of them wowed me. In all fairness, they were simply ok, the portions were good, and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Had two of the vegetarian tacos - both great, similar to Tex Tubbs' but fresher, not overcooked as Tubbs' veggies can be.  The chips and salsas were outstanding.  Great service too, AND 10% off your meal with Bicycle Benefits.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love Bel Air in Milwaukee, and was excited for the Madison location to open. 

The pros: The food was good, the hostess was welcoming and kind, $2 tacos and taps on Tuesday   

The cons: The Madison location is lacking much of the charm of the Milwaukee locations. The decor is a little blander. The service was little less sparkling. The Michelada, one of my favorite drinks, was undrinkable (way too much Worcestershire sauce). The bartender was surly and it felt like we were supposed to eat and get out. 

Overall I'll save Bel Air for a Milwaukee treat."}
{"text":"Decent overall! Been here a few times. Love the house salsas, have tried a wide variety of tacos and the Ninja Pig is my favorite; shrimp taco is my least favorite and the only one that I wouldn't order again; chorizo and cochinita pibil were also yummy. I tried the pollo tamale and found it surprisingly bland and dry; probably will steer clear of tamales here. Guacamole is great; friends said the margaritas are tasty and they seemed well priced. Good place for cheap TexMex style food- come away full for less than $13 a person. I really wish they had a few healthier (i.e. not involving beans and rice) options; I would order the grilled fajitas but they serve 2-3 and there's not an individual portion option, and requesting a side salad went poorly each time (first time we were there they said it wasn't something they offered, last time they provided me with a half order of their \"tostada salad\" which is a fried corn tortilla slathered in black bean spread, covered in heavily dressed iceberg with cheese, avocado and corn- I had only a few bites- it was tasty, but definitely not a good option for someone trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle). 

The atmosphere is a little bizarre, especially for anyone who remembers the expansive, refined dining room of the restaurant formerly in this space. Very bright, crowded, earsplittingly loud, and oddly laid out. Surf/beach themed decor. The vibe reminds me of a college cafeteria. There are probably 2 dozen servers and hosts running around, and the food comes out almost too quickly. It's not a place to go and relax but it adds a fast casual option near the square which comes in handy when trying to get to a show or event (although be prepared for a wait- every time we've been it's been packed with a wait time between 20-40 minutes)."}
{"text":"I'd skip this attempt at trendy food and go for the legit authentic street tacos elsewhere. The only thing I really liked about this place was the salsa verde. The rice and beans were super bland. Even their version of the s'mores we had were sub par. It was kind of offensive. The decor was fun."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars.

I've been here twice now. Once was around 10:30 on Halloween. The place was dead and my partner and I were looking for a late night snack. We each got a chorizo taco (meat for me soy for them) and agreed they were delicious. We also shared the charred pineapple margarita and an order of the churros. Also amazing. We left feeling in love with bel air cantina. It had plenty of vegetarian options plus delicious meat ones, it was more convenient than Tex Tubbs and it didn't struggle with Tex Tubs issue with over stuffing the tacos and therefore making them difficult to eat. 

But.. the magic faded some on my second visit, a weekday around 7:30. The place was packed and service seemed overwhelmed. I got a second dose of the chorizo taco (still great), as well as a Korean taco and a chicken taco. The Korean was solid, but the chicken was forgettable. And the rice and beans plate was so pitiful I wished I stuck with two tacos and saved room for churros or something else on the menu.

I still think this place is a good addition to the food scene in Madison, but I'm curious to try Canteen, because Bel Air does leave some room for improvement."}
{"text":"This place is great! They have so many fun taco flavors, and they put a fancy little fried plantain on top of your plate as a fun little surprise."}
{"text":"If not for $2 Taco Tuesdays, I probably wouldn't go to BelAir, but the chips and salsa in addition make it too good of a deal to pass up for a quick taco fix. 

Service on these nights always feels rushed too due to the volume of people coming in and out on Tuesdays. You could get a full meal of three tacos with rice and beans for less than $10 with tip, which is crazy considering the location! 

Three tacos plus rice and beans is a little too much food for me, so I got two: the queso fundido and the Ninja pig. The queso could use a little bit of a quick and is rather bland, while the Ninja pig is almost too sweet, but the pickled vegetables are nice.

Nothing great sticks out to me about BelAir; it's not bad by any means but there are a lot of other yummier tacos to be eaten in Madison."}
{"text":"This place has a fun atmosphere and good selection! As a gluten free eater I wasn't a huge fan of some of the tacos I tried, but I would definitely give it another shot!"}
{"text":"Actual rating: 3.5

The food quality and freshness brought the score down a little bit for me. The complementary chips and salsa are always a plus, but their spiciest of 3 options lacked a lot of heat. And on top of that, they make you pay a $1.45 extra to add \"spice\" to dishes. I ordered the shrimp burrito; not the size of a chihuahua, but pretty flipping big and will most definitely earn you a food baby. The queso fundido atop the burrito baby was unfortunately cold when it came to our table and a little overbearing when complemented with their citrus-y sauce. 

Tara, our waitress, on the other hand was awesome!! Excellent, friendly service. The beachy, open vibes of this place make me wanna go back but I'm conflicted with the lack of fresh ingredients and competing flavors."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Belair Cantina and i will most definitely be back again. The place inside is cute and they have great lively music playing . I loved that our waitress explained a little bit about its history. We tried their cinco margaritas and they were delicious. The only sad thing is that they only make margaritas on the rocks so if you are looking for a frozen margarita this is not the place to go. I tried a few tacos and my friend had a burrito. They were both very delicious, my favorite taco by far was the carne asada taco. They also give you chips and salsa once you sit down. There are 3 different type of salsa and they are all pretty good. I didn't think any were spicy. I would highly recommend visiting if you get a chance!"}
{"text":"This is another restaurant that I wanted to like so badly, but everything was kind of terrible. 
When you walk in you are hit in the face with the smell of the grill and the noise. This is the noisiest restaurant I've been to in a loooong time. One of the smelliest too. I left smelling like food. There was an hour wait, which we expected so that didn't bother me. When we were walked back to our table I noticed spilled food and drinks everywhere. Why was it so messy? Why didn't anyone bother to clean it up? Anyway, we  sat and all ordered drinks, the mystery shot, and guac and queso to start. They took some time to come out. Actually, our apps ended up coming out with our food. Like, delivered at the exact same time. We ate the guac and queso after our tacos, and the server did not refill our chips and we still had a good 75% of the guac left. She did ask if we wanted to take it home...but it will get brown. I wanted to eat it right then! Apparently that was not an option. My tacos were just fine. Actually, 2 were not worth the calories. The kale and veggie taco had so much kale that's all you could taste. The pollo verde taco tasted like shredded chicken in a corn tortilla, and that's it. The port queso taco was pretty decent, though. There were literally 2 bites of rice, and maybe 4 bites of beans on my plate. I understand why it's free. I will say that the queso and guac were great, but it would have been nice to have them before the tacos, and to get a refill on the chips. Our server was nice enough, but not attentive. She never noticed we didn't get our apps, and never apologized when they came out together with the entrees. And the whole chip thing...
If the guac and queso weren't so tasty I'd be giving this 1 star. 
When you have places in town like Compadres and Canteen you should skip BelAir. Seriously, walk a block over and go to Canteen."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars but I'm rounding up. I've been to Bel Air a couple of times now with friends and I can't say I've been terribly impressed or wowed by their food either times but some of it is pretty solid. I think they do a better job of their out-there tacos such as the Ninja Pig, which is crispy pork with hoisin sauce and a jicama slaw. Their more traditional tacos - such as the carne asada which I ate alongside the Ninja Pig - seem to fall short based on my own experience and my friends' experience. My carne asada meat was dry and pretty flavorless, which was disappointing because I usually try to order that or carnitas to determine if a taco place is legit. The rice and beans that comes on the side with your meal is kinda meh too, like I'm not expecting those sides to have tons of flavor but more than what I got! 

Their margaritas are yummy, as are their nachos, and I'm a fan of the 3 salsas you get with your chips when the meal starts. I just feel that, especially for the price, I would have expected more consistency from the tacos all around. It's still a cool place to grab drinks and some food with friends - the decor is colorful, the atmosphere is fun, the music is good - but I'm not sure it would be my first choice."}
{"text":"I waited patiently for so long for the Madison location to open! Some of my favorite tacos!"}
{"text":"Can you say TACO TUESDAY! YES! Lunch with friends was spot on at Bel Air:) I'm a huge fan of Bel Air in Milwaukee!! Was so happy to see the restaurant open in Madison! Can't wait for my next meal!! Pretty MUCH everything on the menu is wonderful. Don't walk, RUN to Bel Air!"}
{"text":"This was a great find! The staff were attentive and friendly. Enjoyed the chips and salsa very much! Didn't have to ask for refills on chips or drinks. Food came out quickly and hot. Burrito was delicious!"}
{"text":"Bel Air is still fairly new to Madison. The booths look plain and uncomfortable but are really not at all. We asked to be seated by the window, and although there were just two of us the host accommodated us with pleasure, and without even a hint of \"oh, fine, if you insist.\" He made sure to turn around and ask how our day was going on the way to the booth, and we saw him do the same to another party; it's a nice personal touch. The waitress was just as pleasant, and all smiles. The chips and salsa were spot on, and we ordered some tacos and a quesadilla. The quesadilla was good, though not a stand-out dish by any means in terms of either flavor or size. The Pollo Yucatan taco was our favorite, flavorful and fresh. The mahi mahi taco was just ok, and the lamb Barbacoa taco was something we wish we hadn't ordered. It wasn't very big, but a full shotglass of grease dripped out of it, enough to cover the entire bottom of the plate.  We saved it for last, which was a big mistake because it was unfortunately our last impression. Bel Air is doing it right when it comes to service, but still has some issues to iron out when it comes to the food. Since we appreciate good service, we'll give it another chance, hoping the kitchen is up to speed by then too."}
{"text":"I was SO excited for Bel Air Cantina and was practically counting down the days until it opened. However, I was sorely disappointed in encountering the worst tacos I've ever had in the Madison area (and probably my entire life).

Let's start from the top. We walked in and got seated instantly. The place was bustling and all of the staff were very friendly and upbeat, but the interior kind of makes you feel like you're eating inside of a too-brightly-lit Hollister store. It's definitely not an intimate atmosphere, so keep that in mind when you're planning date night.

I loved that we got three different salsas and they were all AMAZING. My favorite was the salsa verde. We ordered \"margaritas\", but they're basically just cocktails made with tequila. I got the Fresa Fresca, which was sweet but not too sweet. My boyfriend got the Madtown, which was awesome. However, we both ordered a Madtown for the second round and it tasted completely different the second time.

I was still excited at this point.... and then our food arrived. To be fair, we got our food mere MINUTES after ordering (I'm talking single digits here, people). However, I'd rather have waited a while and gotten some halfway decent tacos.

I ordered the carne asada, the gringo, and the pollo verde. I was disappointed with all three. They were all dry and tasteless. The carne asada was the most disappointing. The meat looked more like ground beef, definitely not what I think of when I read \"grilled steak\" on the menu. It also seemed to have absolutely no seasoning on it. STEER CLEAR of the carne asada tacos, you WILL be disappointed.

All in all, the service was awesome and the chips and salsa were great, but there were consistency issues with the margs and the tacos were terrible. I'll be giving it another shot, but I certainly won't be ordering tacos here ever again."}
{"text":"Not entirely sure what the hype is about here...food is good but not worth the price unless you go on a night with a deal. Most of it tastes the same"}
{"text":"Wholeheartedly enjoy their gluten free selections and how fast their service is. Seriously, you go there and the tacos come out faster than you can say \"I love tacos\" which I appreciate when I am ravenous. Go to taco Tuesday, sit at the bar, and get extra of the red salsa and you'll be a happy human."}
{"text":"I've been to Bel Air Cantina 3 times in the last two months. Twice to this location and once to the location in Wauwatosa. 
Tacos are my favorite food so you have to mess up pretty badly to disappoint me in other words...
I've met few tacos that i didn't like. I will say I prefer the Margarita to the Paloma... which has very little grapefruit flavor compared to other palomas I've had in the past at other watering holes. As far as happy hour goes... there is a margarita upgrade option during certain times where you can get a higer shelf tequila for the price of the well tequila... not super thrilling.
As far as food goes...I prefer the Pollo Verde to taco to any of the other chicken offerings. I did however enjoy the fish taco I tried on one of my visits as well. If you order 3 tacos you get \"free\" rice and beans and if you ask for just rice they will oblige. 
Overall I've had great service and i have been happy with the promptness with which my food was delivered even during busy times on Taco Tuesdays. i'm sure i'll be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Chill spot to get tequila and tacos. My friend and I stopped by to grab a belated birthday dinner, and we weren't disappointed for our first visit. 

Our waitress was super upbeat and friendly, she did talk a little fast, and covered a lot of information all at once, so once she left it left my head spinning a little. I would have almost preferred a short crash course than the long first-timers schpeel.

I ordered the taco trio and margarita, and we shared an order of the corn, a tequila flight, and cheesecake for dessert. The tacos were fantastic! The corn and cheesecake were fantastic! Everything was absolutely fantastic!

We'll definitely stop back in!"}
{"text":"Came here for their special on Tuesday, $2 select tacos and discounted beer! If you order at least 3 tacos, you get rice and beans too.

Def expect to have a wait on Tuesday or Thursday, this seems like the spot to go for tacos then. We waited about 20-30 minutes but ended up just grabbing seats by the bar.

I though the tacos were okay, the two I really liked were the ninja pig and the chorizo. Haven't tried their non specials yet so don't want to comment on the rest of the food.

Will return to try out more of their food!"}
{"text":"We tried Belair for lunch on Friday. I really liked the clean and modern decor. The wait staff were all friendly. Our waiter was excellent with recommendations and refills.

The highlight for me was definitely the chips and salsa. The chips were crunchy, hearty, and not greasy. They came with a mildy spicy orange salsa, a mild salsa verde, and brown ranchero salsa. I ordered the carne asada, al pastor, and carnitas tacos which came with rice and pinto beans. The carne asada was definitely the star w/perfectly cooked flavorful steak, onions, and cilantro. The al pastor seemed a bit fatty and I wasn't a huge fan of the texture in the carnitas.  However they all had excellent flavors. The rice was tasty. The beans were good albeit a bit watery. My dining partner had the torta which looked amazing.

I'll definitely go back for the service, the atmosphere and the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"For as hyped up as BelAir Cantina was, I wasn't super impressed by any means. I went later on a Friday night, and it was fairly busy still, but we were seated within 5 minutes or so. 

The chips and salsa are really good, and the three different salsas are all exceptional, but that's probably the best thing on the menu. I had the nachos and was very unimpressed; the portion was fairly large but the nachos were nothing special and weren't super hot either. 

The location and service are great, but I wouldn't say the food is worth the walk or the potential wait on a busy night."}
{"text":"To start with, chips and three types of salsa are served. The red tomatillo and green chili sauce go well with the warm chips. The shrimp tacos are the best. The quesadillas with chicken are delicious. 
Definitely a place to get your tacos. Guacamole was slightly bland. Ask for some spice. Good food is backed with great service."}
{"text":"They have a nice location, but it's a bit on the noisy side.

They greet you with warm chips which is my fave, and 3 different salsas. All have good flavor, but none have any heat to them. Regular margaritas are decent, but not worth the $6.50 price tag. 

Queso comes with jalapeños and garlic, which gave it a distinct flavor.

I ordered 3 tacos. Spicy pollo was noted as a house favorite and was not the least bit spicy. Carne asada-also noted as a house special, and the ninja pig. The ninja pig was the only one that had any sort of flavor, but the sauce on that taco was on the sweet side so not my fave.

Babe got the gringo boring. I mean, burrito.

On the plus side, the food all came out incredibly fast.

Other than to bring my tequila loving mom here for their extensive tequila offerings, and to try a sour apple jalapeño marg, I wouldn't never plan to come back."}
{"text":"Lunch on the outdoor patio was very pleasant, despite slow service.  A brief trip indoors to secure seating was met with uncomfortably loud music.  Not good. Fortunately, the weather was beautiful and an outdoor table was available.  Fresh chips with 3 decent salsas were delivered promptly but it took at least 20 minutes for the beers we ordered to appear.  

When it finally arrived, the Bel Air take on Mexican food was relatively light and quite tasty:
Plate1 had a Black Bean & Corn Tamale and Spicy Pollo Taco w/ Chile de Arbol Oil.  The tamale, wrapped in a fluffy masa, was vegan.  The small container of Chile de Arbol Oil added spicy deliciousness to the taco and enlivened the tamale as well.  Really good.
Plate 2 had a Black Bean and Corn Taco and a Pollo Verde Taco.  Both looked appetizing and the diner was pleased. 

We would definitely return to sample other menu items or to order the items we had today again.  Since the place just opened, it is no surprise that service needs fine tuning.  The blast of loud music indoors is not a plus."}
{"text":"We are in complete disbelief of the experience our party had tonight. A party of 6, celebrating graduating and receiving prestigious awards, thinking this place would be great to celebrate and go down memory lane...My party was rudely awakened, allow me to elaborate...

My party arrives to the restaurant around 9:30pm, the restaurant was not busy, but the table wasn't ready and it took the staff an exceptionally lengthy time to clear a table so my party could be seated. My party is seated and Lisa is the waitress. Lisa takes the drink meal orders of all 6 people, there was a wait to receive the drink orders...again the place wasn't busy and it didn't appear that they were short staffed. Then the food decides to appear, there was a special for $2 tacos...great, right? Wrong! My wife(left to wash her hands before eating) and a friend orders from the special menu, when their food arrived my wife had 3 beef/pork appearing tacos, she doesn't eat beef or pork. Her friend has a shrimp taco that she didn't order, but she was eating her beans and rice. They call for a waitress to retrieve Lisa, this same waitress decides to come back instead of Lisa and proceeds to blame my wife for the order being wrong, and states that \"all I need to do is being you 1 taco and switch plates\"...My wife disagrees with the waitress who wants to give her the plate that someone else has eaten off of. So after back and forth with the waitress, my wife asks for a manager. 

The waitress goes to get the manager and sends him back with the plates, having him to switch the plates and just add the \"correct\" taco to my wife's plate. My wife asks the manager if the plates were switched or if they were brand new, the manager tells her they were switched. A friend says \"we may need to call the health department\", the manager says \"call them\". After letting the manager know the issue and him blaming the argumentative waitress, instead of seeing how to fix the issue, he finally goes back to fix the plate, but our friends plate was still incorrect. After my wife's plate is fixed, our friend asks for her food to be returned to the kitchen as she no longer wanted hers.

The waitress Lisa(my party's waitress) shows up and is all apologetic and wanting to fix things, after the fact...So the manager decides to comp my wife's order and charges her $2.50 for her drink, Lisa rechecks with everyone to make sure the checks were correct...My wife's was right, my friend who returned her food was right, 2 other ladies checks were incorrect, needed fixing...While Lisa is fixing them she proceeds to run my wife's card for the 2 ladies who's checks were incorrect and hers, charging her over $18!!! How many things can go wrong? 

The food wasn't good. Shrimp were fishy, spicy chicken was bland, at least the bean taco was ok. Beans and rice was just ok. The drinks were not up to par either.

This place is a disaster, we nor anyone else I can find will ever go back to this place. The wait and management staff were challenging, unable to get orders correct, disrespectful or simply neglectful, and the food was only subpar."}
{"text":"great place, nice staff, fabulous margs. One recommendation for the management: it's way too bright. The direct, overhead, fluorescent lights give it an office/school vibe"}
{"text":"This is what Madison was missing!

Everything was absolutely great here. The drinks (basic house margs) were strong and flavorful, the three salsas that come with the chips were out-of-this world delicious, and the burrito (veggurito) was really really good! It's so nice having a restaurant in town that offers so many thoughtfully-created vegan/vegetarian options without diners needing to ask for a dozen substitutions.

The atmosphere is bright and lovely all-around, and the servers were very friendly. Bel Air's opening was worth the wait and I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and it was just fine. It was pretty boring Mexican food. I don't see why you would go here over Canteen which is a block down. My margarita was good though. It's a more college student vibe than some of the other places on the square which isn't a good thing in my book, but might be what you are looking for."}
{"text":"This is a GREAT upscale taqueria near the capitol! The tacos were exciting flavor mixes (the Z Shrimp tacos were a crowd favorite), all for a really reasonable price. Had the house lemonade as my drink, fresh squeezed is the best and they do it up nicely. All told, fabulous experience, would definitely recommend :)

Oh yeah, and the tamales rock! Get a tamale with your taco plate, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"So far I have dined at Belair twice, and I had a really great experience and a so-so experience. My first time dining was a Monday and they have 25% off all burritos, so I had to go that route of course! I tried the Gringo burrito as it was recommended by a co-worker. The burrito was absolutely HUGE and amazing, I almost thought it tastes like a casserole in a burrito. Our service was amazing, the chips and trio of salsas that you get as a free app are really, really good. Overall this trip was very satisfying and I feel like you can get A LOT of food for a great price. I ended up taking half of my burrito home 'for later' (which ended up only being an hour later, haha). So, fast forward a few weeks, we did a work lunch there  with 6 of us. We went on a Tuesday, and they have a deal on Tuesdays where select tacos and tamales are $2/each, and if you get 3 or more you get a free rice/bean side! I decided to take advantage of this special, and I got the Ninja Pig taco, the Baja Tilapia taco, and the Pollo tamale...I was not quite as impressed this round, and I had really wished I got the burrito again. The Tilapia taco just tasted like breaded fish on a shell, not much flavor. The Ninja pig was a little too crispy for my taste, it was almost dry, but I did like the flavor. I LOVE tamales, and the tamale they brought out was really disappointing. It was not like a traditional tamale at all - way too much breading, not enough filling. The filling that was there, was really dry chicken. If/when I go back, I will be sticking to a burrito because they seem to have those down. Also, the second trip - it was much busier and it really showed. Our waitress didn't come back to take our order for a really long time and we had to hunt her down several times. We kept asking for water and finally asked if she could leave a jug on the table (because it was impossible to get water from her) and she gave us a story why they are not allowed to, so that kind of sucked...if she was checking on us it would be one thing, but she was not.  A few of my co-workers have been back since and have commented on the poor service. I think it's worth a try to see what you think for yourself!"}
{"text":"If you want to go all out for taco Tuesday, this is the place. $2 TACOS???? insahhhn. I was expecting pretty poor quality food, but the tacos did not disappoint. I got the black bean and corn taco and it was delicious. 

They also have amazing Sangria (highly recommend the rose) and the patio is awesome during the summer.

Service is a wee bit slow. So, if you're looking for a quick lunch this may not be the place for you."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch.  The queso was amazing!  Took a little bit of time to get some service at the bar and I was only one of four people."}
{"text":"Very good. Went for lunch on a weekday and the place was pretty full, but we got seated right away. Our server was casual but attentive (never breathing down our necks but genuinely asked how our lunch was). 

Had a three taco plate - probably too much for lunch because it includes beans and rice - but there were too many good taco options to not want to try at least three. Had a ninja pig, avocado and bacon, and korean beef. All three were good, though the Korean Beef was excellent (I could have had three of these). 

Anyway, yeah, good tacos, good service, no complaints here."}
{"text":"The food was great!  We went for brunch and were not disappointed.  Amazing, fresh Mexican fare and delicious bloody Mary's.  I had the huevos rancheros which were cheesy and delicious.  I also had the Bloody' Mateo which was a great spin on a classic breakfast cocktail.  

I'm only giving them 4 stars because they do not allow dogs on their outdoor patio, which was a major disappointment.  I really wish more restaurants in Madison would be more accommodating to our four legged friends who just want to lie on the patio and be good boys and girls.  

I can't wait to go back and try the tacos this week!"}
{"text":"Great food, disappointing service. I frequent the MKE locations so I definitely know the vibe and food of a typical BelAir. We came in for brunch to an almost-empty restaurant but waited more than 20 minutes (and for us to ask the hostess what was going on) in order to even see a waitress. Super weird. The food was good - my go-to for brunch here are the tacos + add an egg - and the coffee was amazing. I hope they can work out the kinks in their service and make this an overall great experience next time!"}
{"text":"Free chips with 3 free amazing dips. The $2 tues/thurs is a great deal and I have not been disappointed yet! I would recommend the Esquite, burritos made into chimichangas and for the tacos: ninja pig and lamb barbacoa"}
{"text":"Just ok - would rank it #3 of 3 in the Capital Square area. We've been looking for layers of flavor in Madison Mexican food and missed it here.  Uncomfortable seating and lighting didn't help.  Service was slow too but that that can be an issue at many places."}
{"text":"Creative Cali Mex food with enough variety and enough classics to please the whole group. Lots of great tequila margs and mixers. Definitely has its own style. Good service and seems like a great place for a big group. Lots of seating."}
{"text":"BelAir has been hopping ever since it arrive to Madison and while I can say the food was pretty good, the wait to get a table and actually eat the food is wayyyy to long!

There are a lot of great tacos to select from with unique flavor combinations and it was fun to try a variety! I would love to frequent BelAir more often but until the wait slows down (or I start eating dinner at 4) I'm going to have to sit this one out.

Must try taco: Ninja Pig and Fried Avocado & Bacon!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite. Orders tacos: ninja pig and carne asada. Flavors were amazing, super delicious and wish I had ordered more. The chips and salsa were all delish too even for picky ol' me. Service was great! I had to rush so I couldn't stay for long but would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Bad service!! First time I've spent 2 hours in a restaurant for eating 3 tacos!! Also got a shot of mystery tequila in a broken glass!!!!! I would give zero stars if we're possible"}
{"text":"I will never fault an establishment for slow service when it's a Saturday night and the place is packed.  But, it would be nice to get acknowledged by a bartender while waiting for a drink and a table to open up.  \"One second and I'll be right with you,\" can go a long ways... no acknowledgment from a bartender is a good way to get possible patrons to turn around and walk out.

Let's get to the food.  Chips and three types of salsa were brought to our table shortly after being seated.  The salsas were fantastic but they were served in stainless steel vessels that had tall brims, making it more than frustrating to dip a chip.  We started with the Roasted Mexican Corn that was served on the cob.  This is some of the best I have ever had, spicy with enough citrus to provide a palatable balance with each bite.  For the main course, we decided to go with tacos.  My lovely wife went with the Korean Beef taco and the Mi Casa Es Su Casa taco, which is with lobster and shrimp mac 'n cheese.  I went for the Cochinita Pibil (slow roasted pork), the Ninja Pig (crispy pork with Hoisin glaze), and the Fried Avocado & Bacon tacos.  It is noteworthy that when you order three tacos, rice and beans included.  I went with black beans as opposed to pinto beans.

Across the board, with a couple exceptions, the tacos were ok.  There seemed to be a lack of flavor/seasoning.  The Mi Casa Es Su Casa taco sounded more ridiculous than anything but the flavors worked, and it was delicious.  The Cohinita Pibil taco was amazing... knocked my socks off. Tender and smoky with a hint of citrus. Instead of carnitas, I am going to start making Cochinita Pibil or Puerca Pibil at home... if I can find banana leaves.  But that is where the praise stops.  The Korean Beef taco was disappointing with flavor and texture more akin to beef jerky.  The Ninja Pig was more chewy than crispy and the sweetness of the glaze was more detracting than enhancing of the experience.  The Fried Avocado & Bacon taco was in desperate need of salt and did not deliver on the heat promised by the serrano chile mayo.  Despite the missteps with the tacos, the black beans and rice were flavorful and a good addition to the meal.

I can appreciate what Belair is trying to do with the convenient location off the Square, the $2 dollar select tacos on Tuesday and Thursdays, and All-You-Can-Eat Fish tacos on Fridays during Lent... but the whole experience just left me disappointed, in general.  The atmosphere and decor is vibrant and the menu reads to reflect that vibrance.  However, the flavor was just not there.  

I wouldn't mind trying the place, again, but Belair has to step up the consistency on delivering flavor to get on the same level as other Mexican restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Almost gave it three stars but then realized that would be too generous because I don't believe I'll be returning here.  I think the only saving grace was their 3 salsas w/ their chips that each table gets.  Those were very good and kept us fed while we waiting a very long time for our food....I was there in a group of 8 for lunch, in a bit of a time crunch because we had to get to a work meeting, however it should have been plenty of time.  Sadly, the \"kitchen was behind\" or something like that (I didn't hear the waitress directly myself) and so it took about 35 minutes for us to get our food.  Then, when the food finally did come, they seemed to have no clue on who ordered what.  They were questioning every plate \"who had the ____?\" and half the plates they first brought out didn't even belong to our table.  Soon we had at least one or two other waitresses coming out with food trying to figure out which plates were ours.  I gotta say, I was embarrassed for them.  Food wise, it wasn't too much better.  In theory, I loved all the taco choices and I got a platter of three with rice and beans, subbing in one taco for their enchilada special they had that day.  Turns out, the tacos were meh, and the special was really nothing special at all.  Props to them for a great, fun atmosphere and I assume probably some tasty drinks, but this being my first experience here will probably also be the last."}
{"text":"I work downtown so have ordered carry out a few times but have yet to dine in. 

Food is great and I would give them five stars on quality, flavor and portion. I have had their chicken and shrimp bowls, the triple ceviche, pepinos and roasted corn. All were delicious!

Their service is what caused me to give them four stars, and it's varied each time I went. The first time, I was not given plastic ware. The second, the male cashier rolled his eyes and sighed when I paid with cash. The front register apparently didn't have change and so he had to go to the one at the bar. And the third time, my order had to be rushed, even after arriving 20 minutes after ordering. I understand it's the lunch hour, and they may be busy, but I'm still a paying customer and I always tip--even when carrying out. 

Either way, I'm still returning for the food. :)"}
{"text":"Love coming here and I do quite a bit. They have 2 dollar toco Tuesday's and their vegetarian options are to die for. Overall the meal is cheap and worth every penny"}
{"text":"Fails in comparison to similarly themed Texas Tub, about equivalent to geopolitical enemy canteen in terms of quality of service and satisfaction of experience. I would return to sample the burritos because they looked great."}
{"text":"One of my newest favorites. This new restaurant is super chill and a great stop for lunch. The view outside is great, the capital right up the street and a beautiful seating area outside when it's warm out. You walk into a very vibrant hostess area. There are about five of them working each time I'm here! They have an iPad system to help seat everyone fast and orderly. You can also sit at the bar if you find a seat, ordering here is fast and easy as well. There are about five bartenders here too so everything is easy! The menu is made or anyone. 

There are different sections and markers for vegetarians and vegans. This makes it easy to find anything whatever you are craving or wanting to try. They bring you warm crispy chips with three different salsas! There is an orange medium salsa that is super tasty. The green salsa is mild and there is a brown salsa that is flavorful similar to a vinaigrette. The servers are all very knowledgeable about the food and what pairs well with everything.  

The food came out really fast. It looked delicious and we were all very happy. The combinations in the tacos are amazing. I was super happy with this visit and will go again soon. The service was great and the food was excellent! As we left we were thanked by a hostess which was super nice. Overall a great time."}
{"text":"The decor and atmosphere are very nice. The food is curiously flavorless, from the rice to the pinto beans to the Baja Tilapia tacos to the Carnitas tacos. The chips and salsa were pretty good."}
{"text":"Back in the good old days (2012), I would frequent the original North Water location monthly.  Hearing that one would be opening up in Madison (where I live now), I was nothing but excited.

My first time here was for the $2 Taco Tuesdays/Thursdays special.  I had ninja pig, carne asada, and barbacoa.  The ninja pig tasted a little sweet for me.  But overall, a real enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"There was a misprint for prices on the menu for margaritas that (obviously) I wasn't aware was a misprint because I shouldn't be expected to read minds. I ordered a half pitcher of a t which was listed at $9 but was charged $22.50 for it when the bill came which was listed as the price for a full pitcher. When inquiring about the bill I was told that the tequila used in that one was a premium tequila and of course it would not be $9. Now I love margs, but don't know very many types of tequila so would never have known that. Regardless, I don't think any customer should be expected to know what top shelf brands are. Anyways, I am told that it is a misprint and they will have to charge me the $22.50. I roll with it and don't even argue any further. The manager then comes up to us (without us asking for one) and asks if there's any issues with the pricing..... managers tells us that it's a misprint but no he will not adjust the price and they \"can't tell every customer about every misprint on the menu.\" I just found this whole situation to be handled so poorly and inappropriately especially because we weren't even arguing over the cost after our discussion with the original server, this is false advertising and as a business you have a responsibility to correct your mistakes if there are any."}
{"text":"Had to send back the Korean beef because it seemed to be a close relative to car tires. Server forgot to bring requested habanero salsa. Appetizer came out after main course. Server didn't take returned dish off bill until requested. The $1.50 charge for extra salsa seemed a bit absurd"}
{"text":"I went on a Thursday for the $2 tacos. The wait was an hour but we found a spot at the bar and had a drink while we waited. The salsa is so yummy and the food was fantastic! I will be back."}
{"text":"This was such a pleasant surprise! A friend and I tried to go to DLUX for game day (dumb idea right away) and the second we walked in, we walked back out because we knew the wait would be way too long. We were super pumped when we found out Bel Air has brunch options...yuuuum. I got the huevos rancheros. They were good/average, but a great bang for your buck- you get a pretty large skillet and rice and beans on the side for $8.23! The pitcher of pear sangria was delicious as well. We even got chips and salsa before our food came, and let me tell youuuu, their salsa options are on point. Our server and host were lovely. And I loved how they play Spanish lessons over the speakers in the bathroom. Fab place!"}
{"text":"Aesthetically, this place looks much better than the Francesca's that used to be in this place.  The design accommodates more people and the larger bar makes this a place you could stop for a quick drink without feeling like you're just drinking at a restaurant.  They have a large selection of tacos, but I would say they are a little overpriced given that the menu is designed to order tacos a la carte.  They want you to order 3 so you can have the rice and beans included, but the price of each taco is different and could add up to over $15 for just 3 small tacos if you don't pay attention.  

I had no problem with the food or the drinks, but the service wasn't great.  We ordered a pitcher of margaritas for the table, but were told that we couldn't also have a pitcher of water because \"it was an open container.\"  This is probably the dumbest thing I've heard in a while.  The staff looks to be mainly college-aged students and the their training seems to be lacking on many fronts.  I'll give them a pass for being new and finding their groove, but this place won't last long near the square unless the service improves."}
{"text":"Food was really good and service was good. Chips and salsa are so good. Def made the mistake of eating too many chips before the food came out. Overall"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great New Mexican joint with delicious food, strong and tasty drinks, and a friendly staff...SKIP THIS PLACE AND GO TO CANTEEN, just a couple of blocks down the street. (See my review on Canteen's Yelp page.) 

My husband and I had such a disappointing experience at Bel Air Cantina that we have decided not to give it a second try. We came here for dinner a couple of Fridays ago around 6pm. The place was full, but we managed to get seated right away. Our server came around just as we were starting to wonder if our table had been assigned to anyone. The chips that he brought were fresh and tasty (this is the only reason I increased my review to two stars), but the salsas were pretty flavorless and weak. When I asked our server what was his favorite taco on the menu, and he seemed pretty unenthusiastic about his recommendation: \"I dunno, I guess I like the ninja pig.\" I reluctantly ordered the recommended taco, but by this point, I already had pretty low expectations. 

Our food came very quickly--too quickly for anything to have been prepared fresh. I had three tacos: the ninja pig, the Korean beef, and the mango tilapia, while my husband ordered a Korean beef burrito. Every one of my tacos was dry and flavorless, as if my food had been reheated in a microwave. The hoisin glaze on the ninja pig was so cloyingly sweet, it overpowered the entire taco. The tilapia was very fishy and dry, which indicates to me that it wasn't very fresh. And the Korean beef was totally inedible--the chunks of beef were so chewy and hard that I lost my appetite. We also shared a margarita that was on special that day, and found it watery, bland, and awfully weak. Neither of us were able to finish our food, and our server picked up our plates and left without asking whether we enjoyed our meals. 

I should also mention that the environment wasn't very inviting. The neon lights were too bright and harsh to create a comfortable dinner environment, and the music was so loud I had to shout across the table. 

Bottom line: This place isn't worth the hype. The food and drink were disappointing, the service was mediocre, and the venue is not a place I would like to stay for more than 20 minutes. We wish we would have just gone to Canteen instead."}
{"text":"My first experience here was OK. I ordered the tostada ceviche and ahi tuna chips. The flavor was a little bland but not bad.

The second time was pretty bad. It was a slow Sunday evening and it seemed like maybe they were trying to get rid of the old before the new week. Our ninja tacos were so dry, basically uneatable. Almost every meat option we had was not tasty. The fried avocado taco was good and the complimentary chips.

When I asked for hot sauce, they gave this mango habanero which was hot and way too sweet. Not what I would call hot sauce.

Service and the space is great, just needs some work on the meals to be up to the Milwaukee location standards."}
{"text":"4.5 stars for drinks, 5 stars for food. If you are downtown Madison you must eat at Bel Air Cantina. It's new to Madison but they have a few locations in the Milwaukee area. A friend suggested we try it, an I was a bit hesitant since I already had 2 favorite Mexican (taco) places I enjoy. Well..... let me tell you, I think this may be my new favorite taco joint. 

We arrived on a Friday around 5:30. The hostess said we had about a 15 minute wait so the 3 of us went to the bar. I ordered the Kiwi margarita which to be honest wasn't that good, I wouldn't order that again. My friend ordered one of their mules (I can't remember which one) and it tasted like my grandmothers attic... it was not good at all. BUT they did redeem themselves with their classic margarita on the rocks, it was pricey but good. 

We were finally called to our table 15 minutes after our wait time they told us. We must have beat the rush as the place really starts to get crowded. 30 minutes was not horrible of a wait but double the wait time they mentioned was slightly frustrating.

The food. o.m.g! Hands down amazing. You get complementary chips and 3 types of salsa. All were good but didn't have a whole lot of heat (spice) to them. We ordered 2 appetizers the queso and and their corn. Sooooo yummy! 

The taco menu was impressive and there were a lot of different options. I tried 3 different kinds all were amazing. An added bonus if you order 3 tacos you get free rice and beans. Score! Not that I needed all that food but what is tacos without rice and beans? 

I was pretty impressed with the menu size and taco options. It also looks like they have a decent happy hour during the week and taco specials Tuesday AND Thursday. 

I did try and take my family back here to eat last Saturday around 7pm. The place was packed! When I went to see the hostess a guy who had been waiting for his table was a bit frustrated. He said he was told an hour wait and it had been well over an hour closer to 1 1/2 hours. The hostess apologized to him and told him it shouldn't be much longer. Unfortunately I knew that was bad news considering I had my children with me. We ended up leaving. Until the next time... I am still craving those tacos!"}
{"text":"I really want to love Bel Air, I really do, but I've been here three times now and find that it's just okay. It's perfectly fine, but nothing exceptional. Now, I may be biased because I'm pescatarian and have not tried their selection of meat tacos, but I wasn't blown away by anything I've eaten. However, I will say the environment is super fun and the margaritas are great! I would recommend coming when they have deals such as happy hour or Taco Tuesday... I got three tacos, rice and beans and a margarita for $12 which you really can't beat."}
{"text":"The first Bel Air outside the greater Milwaukee area and as a frequent visitor there, I was excited to check it out.  Stopping in the day after opening, we knew there would be some kinks here and there.  Adding fuel to the fire was that it was Taco Tuesday ($2 select tacos, $2 select beers).  Bel Air handled it with aplomb.  There was a 30-45 minute wait but luckily we found a couple seats at the bar.  Our bartender was stretched, at times, with the heavy amounts of customers but she was friendly and quick with suggestions.  My better half and I both ordered 3 tacos each as with 3, rice and beans are thrown in for free.  Always a man of value, who can turn down $6 of tacos, rice and beans?  I opted for the barbacoa, housemade chorizo, and tilapia.  Of the three, the chorizo was my favorite.  Sprinkled with radish, cilantro, and potatoes, they had great flavor with just the right amount of greasiness.  For the other two, I wasn't as excited.  I will chalk it to the new opening and the slam of customers as I know they have done better.
We will definitely be back.  Margaritas are on point.  Great chips and salsa.  A menu that has something for everyone.  A perfect combination."}
{"text":"The food is amazing here! We tried a bunch of menu items and it was all delicious.  Our waiter was Brandon B. and he was fantastic and very helpful. Can't wait to go back and try more. Overall it's a very cool fun place to eat, highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"After reading the great review of Bel Aire in the newspaper, we decided to give it a try. It was not a good experience to say the least. When we arrived we were told there would be a 45min wait, which we expected, so we found a spot at the pretty crowded bar. The bartender was pretty crabby and clearly super busy. After a while we asked for some chips and salsa which received praise and were deemed as \"some of the best salsas in town\" so we were excited to try them. The green tomatillo salsa was good. The other two salsas were literally tasteless....like scoop up a whole chip and barely get any flavor. Awful...almost tasted like they ran out of them and just added buckets of water to make enough to fill the bowls. Zero spice and zero flavor. After an hour an 15min wait we were finally seated. Our server was young and somewhat distracted.  Took over 40 mins for her to take our order. The food was fine but not as good as we had expected. Price is reasonable but really the quality was on par with a chain restaurant like Applebee's.  The dining area was dirty (floor covered in chips) and it seemed like everyone around us was equally disappointed in their experience. Hoping for their sake we caught them on a bad night but won't be returning anytime soon to find out. Way too many other taco places to choose from."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food, attentive service. I have to say, their soft opening was a success in my book!

Nearly everything I had was well executed and delicious. I will definitely be back for Taco Tuesday!

What I tried:
Cali Guac- It manages to be silky smooth and chunky at the same time. Amazing. I added the plaintain chips for an extra buck. Worth it.
Ceviche- not a huge fan of ceviche, it was ordered by a table fellow. They liked it. So, it might be your thing too
tilapia taco with mango salsa- just what a fish taco should be!
broccoli and artichoke taco- pass on this one. The flavors were not harmonious and the textures didn't work for me
Mahi mahi taco- delicious, the toppings were on point and the fish was nice and fresh.
Chicken tamale- lovely flavorful chicken and the masa tasted good too! 
Mango/ strawberry smoothie- a fun aperitif, after I crammed all that food down. 
Queso fresco cheesecake-  Hatted the broiled top. That texture and flavor were weird. The innards were great. Not super smooth, but I think that was the point because of the queso fresco. Really could have used more strawberry sauce or a caramel sauce (like the dulce de leche served with the churros)
Churros- these were not churros. They looked like churros, but sure didn't taste like a churro. They should be light and crispy on the outside and moist and fluffy on the inside. These were all chew. I'm from the south west, I know a churro when I see one, and this is not one.

Extra thank you to Bel Air, because the food during their soft opening was free. Now that tells me they want to get it right, at any cost. You nailed it!"}
{"text":"Best tacos and margaritas in Madison! Their staff were extremely friendly and quick to seat us. Glad to have Bel Air in Madison!"}
{"text":"Overall I had a good first experience at Bel Air. I popped in for lunch during the week between their soft open and grand opening. On Tuesdays and Thursdays they have a great deal where select tacos and tamales are a mere $2, and if you order three or more you get rice and beans for free. Six bucks for a full meal sounded like a good enough deal for me!

I opted for the spicy pollo taco, the soy chorizo taco, and the black bean & corn tamale. My favorite of the three was the spicy pollo taco. It had a nice kick in the back of the throat without burning your tongue, which was nice and unexpected. The soy chorizo taco was okay, but I prefer a jolt of flavor. I love the soyrizo from Trader Joe's and I was a little bummed the Bel Air take had no spice to it. The tamale was a disappointment; it was almost completely masa and the filling was mostly long, limp leaves of spinach or kale or other green. There was no mention stewed greens in the description so I'm not sure, but I didn't care for it. Also, two tablespoons of filling wasn't nearly enough for the amount of crust. 

I really liked the rice and black beans that came with the meal, and the chips and salsa trio that came before the meal was a great snack to enjoy while waiting for our plates. The horchata wasn't too sweet and could use a little more cinnamon for my personal preferences, but at $2.50 was a good deal. 

Service was beyond what I'd expect for being open only a week; the server was very knowledgable about the menu and was able to describe several dishes without just parroting back what was written in the descriptions. Recommendations weren't upsells and it was evident she truly enjoyed the food as opposed to just pushing product. The only hiccup was that the check was dropped off without a pen and no one ever came back to the table. I eventually flagged down another server to borrow one and in the grand scheme of things it wasn't a huge deal because I wasn't in a rush to leave. 

Since I hit them early into their operation I didn't have to wait for a table; I'm curious what wait times are like now that word's gotten out. I'll have to go back for lunch again to check!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went in for dinner on Halloween around 9pm. The place didn't seem too busy we were two of the four people at the whole bar. The bartender barely wanted to service us as we sat down and was super rude like we were inconveniencing him. We finally flagged down someone to help take our order at the bar since we couldn't get help from him and she was even worst! She asked who our server was and then end up taking our order rushing us like the place was busy. 

*shaking my head*

Horrible customer service! Plenty of other taco restaurant around town!!!"}
{"text":"Decent food for reasonable prices-especially $2 taco night. Got 3 $2 tacos, which come with free beans and rice if you order 3+ tacos, though 3 tacos was super filling. Although on $2 night (Tuesdays and Thursdays) they only let you pick from a select group of tacos, the ones I had were good-nothing mind blowing, but solid, tasty tacos.  Unlimited free chips with 3 salsas was also a plus.  I ordered the soy chorizo tacos and a Port-queso-I really like the Port-queso, which had mushrooms with a cheese sauce topped with a yummy chimichurri sauce.  The soy chorizo was tasty-you'd never know you weren't eating meat-and the fresh avocado really added to it.  The beans and rice were good as well.  Really like the overall cantina feel, and although there's a ton of seating, there's usually a line, especially on $2 night-I recommend trying to sit at the bar, since it's first-come-first-served.  Solid experience, although I'd call Bel Air more Tex-mex than Mexican!"}
{"text":"I didn't enjoy my food here at all. I didn't feel like it had any flavor. I'm really surprised they even served the mahi mahi tacos the way they were. They had two tiiiny scraps of fish. I enjoyed the beans, but that was it. \"Queso fundido\" was really queso dip, which is fine but definitely not the same thing. Servers were nice, but they had a hard time telling the difference between the tacos  (or they don't have a good system with the kitchen). So we had a lot of passing plates around amongst our group which would be a problem if you're out with people that you're not close enough that you would want them taking a bite of your food..

The cocktails had potential, but are served in pint glasses which really ruins the potential for any balance. Would be way better in a normal rocks glass and scaled down accordingly so it's not overwhelmed with 10 oz of whatever sweet mixer is flavoring the drink. I was pleasantly surprised however that it seemed like they were actually using fresh fruit purées and fresh citrus juice. Was also a good atmosphere for my group of friends."}
{"text":"Decided to swing by for dinner, the decor is nice and our server was great. They have lots of daily specials, which is nice. The Bel Air House margarita didn't have a lot of flavor, and was a bit too salty for my taste. We very much enjoyed the complimentary chips and salsa. The orange salsa was our favorite, but their \"spicy\" salsa had no flavor and no heat whatsoever. The green tomatillo salsa had a nice, fresh taste to it. I like how you can order the tacos a la carte, I got to try three different tacos. The one I disliked the most was the el pastor one (which are my go to when I am at a Mexican Restaurant). There was no flavor and the meat was chewy. I did enjoy the chicken and fish one however. 

What I found the most annoying was the number of servers hanging out by our booth, chatting and hovering over us (one server had her elbow resting on our booth, chatting it up with another server). There were honestly enough servers for each guest to have two. Not sure if it's because the restaurant just opened and they have a lot of employees because of it, or if they were waiting for a busy dinner rush of some sort. It was just awkward and hard to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Wasn't bad, but nothing particularly stood out either. It felt very template for what it was, as if I've somehow been to this restaurant before - except I hadn't. 

Not sure if I would preface their \"hottest\" dip option with a bit about it being spicy; it seemed reminiscent of a Tostito's salsa con queso.

On the plus side, the prices are reasonable and the staff is lively & attentive."}
{"text":"Such a worst place. I prefer the $2 tacos on Tuesday and if they don't want to do that they should remove that program, instead they honor that and treat guests like garbage. One of the worst serviced place in the downtown area. Stay away on Tuesdays and Thursdays if u want to be treated humanely."}
{"text":"Great deal on Tuesday and Thursday for $2 tacos. Very fast and polite service. 2 of the 3 tacos were fantastic with one being average. The chips were fresh and the 3 salsas delicious. For $6.33 for 3 tacos, chips and salsa, and rice and beans it was a great lunch. 4 stars as one of the tacos lacked a bit."}
{"text":"A huge group of 15 of us dropped in recently for dinner on a Friday night.  We did not make reservations and they were extremely accommodating. It took about 10 minutes, but they put a bunch of tables together and found seating for all of us.

First I'll start with the chips and salsa.....very good home made chips that pair well with the salsa.  If you take nothing else from this review, remember this------ Make sure to try the Queso with Chorizo!!!!! It was absolutely the best thing I have eaten in the last 5 years!! The Chorizo was crispy and the queso flavorful and paired so well with the chips and Margaritas.  BTW house margaritas were only $5 and they also had pitchers....but I don't remember how much they were.

The food was good.  I had 3 tacos with various meats.  It also came with beans and rice, both of which were also very good.  

Overall the service was excellent despite the place being very busy.  They kept the pitchers of Margaritas coming and the chips and salsa was endless.  We will definitely be back in the future."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Amazing tacos (Ninja Pig is the BEST) and great margaritas!"}
{"text":"Very crowded on the night I was there. 20 minute wait and they don't really have a good area to wait around in so you just kind of awkwardly stand there. The lighting is uncomfortably bright for a Tex mex style restaurant. Drinks seem watered down, their salsas are mostly tasteless except for the verde. Food is a bit overpriced for what you get, unless you go Tuesday and get the 3 tacos for 6 dollars deal. Tables feel crammed together and you sit uncomfortably close to your neighbors."}
{"text":"It's just AHHight. Nothing too special going on here. They offer an interesting menu with numerous vegetarian options although the end result was a fairly basic and somewhat bland assortment. The margaritas were pretty watered down. The guacamole was fresh and creamy and defiantly good although again bland. The tostada salad sounded interesting although it wasn't. The tortillas for the tacos were super dry like they left them sitting out all day in the air since lunch and didn't use them til I had them for dinner. I went with 3 different veggie tacos all super bland and dry but fun to mix and match. It's fine basic 3 star eats with 3 star service to go with it."}
{"text":"A great place to try. Great margaritas and food. I never find the service is in top-shape, though. The bartenders are usually running around trying to fill too many orders. On the plus side, the bartenders make everything fresh, so it takes them an extra minute to prepare drinks. Overall, I'm a regular, but I come prepared knowing I shouldn't be in a rush."}
{"text":"Accidentally strolled in during their soft launch and it was great. The atmosphere is fun, staff super friendly and efficient, and the food was pretty good. 

Got their Korean beef taco, Ninja Pig taco and the fried avocado & bacon taco. All we're delicious! I'm just gonna list the ingredients and you'll have to check it out yourself because you'll be drooling just from reading.

Korean beef taco - spicy-sweet marinated beef, lettuce, jicama, carrot, lime, Sriracha crema. A little mild for my tastebuds. Still pretty good. The marinated beef was more sweet than spicy, not hint of heat at all. It was served with a slice of lime, which helps but wish there was something to brighten up the flavor. The Sriracha sauce was mild also.

Fried avocado & bacon - avocado, arugula, corn salsa, bacon pieces, Serrano child mayo. Bacon was not noticeable in this taco. Wish they had larger chunks to get that extra flavor. But it was still pretty tasty. It was a refreshing, bright taco. 

Ninja Pig - crispy pork, hoisin glaze, cucumber jicama slaw. My absolute favorite of the three. Packed with so much flavor, sweet and savory. I definitely recommend!

I'm coming back to try the rest of their tacos and other dishes for sure.

Oh and $2 tacos on Tuesdays and Thursdays! Say what?! Note only select tacos apply. But Ninja Pig is one of them, so yeah. Note, it's for dine-in only. The dig is cool so it's a bonus."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot of good things about Bel Air from friends and collages. I went for lunch on a Tuesday to check out there Taco Tuesday special.  There were multiple tacos on the menu that were only $2.00. I tried the spicy pollo and port-queso. Both were very good. The spicy pollo had some good heat that was balanced with the slaw that is put on top. I really like the port-queso. This one was vegetarian taco with mushrooms and queso sauce inside. I try to pick vegetarian options and this would be one I would order again. The best thing was my bill was $4.22, you cannot beat that for a quick and cheap lunch during the work week.

Overall I enjoyed Bel Air and would be willing to try it again. I did notice they have $2.00 tequilla shots as well on Tuesday and Thursday. Maybe next time I come in, it will not be when I have to come back to work."}
{"text":"This place is a no-go for me. I was really curious about it and excited to try it because hello! new Mexican option in Madison, gimme more gimme more (yes, that's a Britney reference). They quoted us a 20 minute wait at about 6:30 on a Saturday night, and we did truly wait exactly 20 minutes. They get your phone number, and once they text that a table is ready, you have 8 minutes to show up.

We get seated and brought small waters and the chips and salsa trio right away. We notice, first of all, that the lighting is pretty bright, which is not preferred when I'll be drinking tequila with potentially flushed cheeks and wanting to have a little romantic mood lighting. The tables are also really close together. We could hear the conversations from the groups next to us. The orange and dark red/brown salsas were watery and did not taste like anything, seriously. We mixed the two together, added hot sauce and salt, and they were still a tasteless, oily, thin liquid. We asked for thirds of the salsa verde though. The thicker style chips were not my favorite either and didn't seem fresh.

Our margaritas were decent. We ended up getting two half pitchers, each for about $22, and they were mostly ice. We left feeling like we didn't actually consume that much alcohol (and I'm a total light weight). The strawberry one was tasty, and the classic lime option was alright. Our meals were marginal, served on colorful plates that reminded me of elementary school cafeteria trays. The beans and rice didn't really seem fresh, and I had a hard time knowing that I was about to pay $5, $4, and $3 for the three tacos I ordered. The $5 and $4 options contained tiny portions of fish and shrimp, and the $3 option was easily something I could've made at home (mozzarella and black beans).

The $6 for three tacos or tamales on Tuesday or Thursday sounds like the way to go with this place. We walked away having a fun night but not because of the restaurant specifically. Sorry, Bel Air Cantina! I wanted to like you."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Saturday afternoon 2pm. They were serving brunch and would not open the regular menu until 3pm. Food was not very good the taco meat was dry  and not very flavorful. The tostadas were sparsely filled and on store bought tortilla shell. I'm don't think any was made from scratch all out of can or packaging. The service was great beer was cold. I would have to say the reason the food came out before the appetizer was that all the food was just sitting in pots waiting to to be used. The number one reason the meat was dry and I'm sure all the flavor was at the bottom of the pots. Quesadilla was good and hot so they put together and it came after the main dishes. Would not come back for authentic Mexican food. Prices were ok but Taco Bell is just as good with out the alcohol."}
{"text":"Love this place!! $2 tacos on Tuesdays AND Thursdays is an amazing deal!! ($6 for 3 tacos w/ rice and beans) + free chips and salsa 

Some of my favorite tacos I've had here are the zihuatanejo shrimp taco, Korean beef, and carne asada!

The queso and Cali guac were also yummy and not over priced!

Get the fresa fresca strawberry marg!!!

*only reason it's not 5 stars is the bartenders arnt friendly at all..... I've been here 3 times and experienced poor service and attitudes from 3 different bartenders. Although the other day we had a super nice female bartender who the manager told us won some type of award the other day which isn't surprising!! Loved her!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed a taco Tuesday with friends. It was very busy but the service was good and the food came out quickly. The flavors were complex and delicious!  I had two tacos, one beef and one with fish and they were very yummy. I rounded out my meal of three items (then you get a side of rice and beans, choice of beans for free) with a tamle which was also good. The margaritas which were on special were a nice bonus for the meal. I'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"Who does not love taco Tuesdays?  I have come for lunch and having $2 tacos for lunch is a great idea.  I have had different types of filling (barbacoa, tilapia, carne asada) and found the meat to be tender and the toppings to be fresh and provided a nice brightness and crunch even with the earthier meats.  The chips and salsa before the meals is great.  I love the three sauces, but the orange salsa (arbol, I believe) is a great and addictive salsa.  The chips are fresh and crunchy.  Definitely a keeper in the rotation."}
{"text":"Tacos were pretty tasty and the margaritas hit the spot.  My problem is that my celiac family member has been sick twice after eating there.  They do not claim to be safe, so I don't fault them, I just wish it was somewhere we could go again."}
{"text":"Why 5 stars? I love a place that does not pretend anything it is not! They make great tacos and give you nice, casual service along with it. Price per taco may seem a little high, but honestly the options are very filling so you do in fact, get a great value. Service has always been prompt for me and I am glad to see this place open in Madison (I am from Milwaukee.) It's really a great, dynamic place for any occasion to have some good tacos. Definitely recommend. 5 stars !"}
{"text":"I'm blown away by how awesome this place was! The food was spectacular, the people that work here are knowledgeable and friendly, the menu is diverse and awesome, prices were extremely reasonable, quality of food and ingredients is very high. And the restaurant has a cool interior design and is nice and clean. Brandon B. was our waiter and he took care of our every need. Dude is a champion. Amazing service, amazing food, fun atmosphere and lots of tequila. I'll be coming here much much much more often for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, tasty tacos...I had the MahiMahi tacos, Shrimp tacos and Lobster/Shrimp tacos. All were excellent, very fresh and filling. Very separately distinct flavors in each. Guacamole was exceptional. I will definitely go there again soon."}
{"text":"Came in at around 6:30 on a Saturday night. We were told it's about a 20 minute wait and they would text us when our table was ready.

Got seated and received our water and complimentary chips + 3 different salsas right away. We got the half pitcher of sangria, shared the shrimp fajitas and got a plate of the plaintains. We asked to start with the plaintains but it came right after the fajitas. They took it off the bill without us even asking which was great! The plate of fajitas was plenty to share between two people, we even had some leftover to pack up. Will definitely be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Wow, great food, great service, nice happy hour. Big kahuna marg---so yummy I had two!  Server was attentive and answered questions or made suggestions. I don't even like mushrooms but the portobello taco was perfectly seasoned and the radish topped it off with a kick. The salsa for chips included 3 selections--the green tomatillo was so fresh in the mouth. The brown smokey one was great. Two things could have been better--music was too loud and the carnitas were surprisingly bland and unimaginative. I look forward to next visit!!


Ok so I guess the stage of the relationship where you try to impress is past. Shoddy service and no offer of chips/salsa made me feel unloved. One more chance and I'll be looking for the next great thing. Seriously, nobody checking in at bar. Food was still good. :)

Alright, it's been a few months and we've been here at least 10 times. I was hoping this might become a regular hang after work but Not so. The bar staff act like they don't know you, make no attempt to engage and snipe about customers within ear shot. Rather than being offered chips and salsa, we often have to ask. Food is still good and reasonably priced especially the specials."}
{"text":"Visited Bel Air on a Tuesday evening and our group of four was told we'd have a 45-60 minute wait. We stopped next door at DLUX for a happy hour drink and were able to get seated at Bel Air within about 35 minutes! 

The complimentary chips and three salsas was AMAZING! Holy man those chips were so good. And the salsas were all great too -- unique in their own ways, and the winner by far at our table was the Spicy Árbol (Árbol chiles,roasted tomatoes, garlic). 

Our waiter was very patient with us and helped us decide which margaritas to get. Two friends ordered the Belair Margarita with raspberry flavoring, another got the Charred Pineapple Margarita, and I ordered a regular Belair Margarita (no flavoring, just lime). I definitely would recommend getting your margarita with a flavor if you're not big into tequila/margaritas in general. The raspberry one was very good, and so was the Charred Pineapple! The taste of the latter had a hint of smokiness to it, which was interesting but great.

We all got tacos since it was Tuesday and they have a number of tacos on the menu specially marked to be $2 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. We all ordered three each, and received free rice and beans since we ordered three tacos! I was overall pleased with the food. I got the Spicy Pollo, Ninja Pig, and Baja Tilapia. By far my favorite was the Baja Tilapia. The avocado salsa on it was real good. The Spicy Pollo was good as well, something fairly simple and reliable if you're not wanting anything too out of the ordinary. Lastly, I wish that the meat on the Ninja Pig was in smaller pieces. While the flavors of the taco itself were fantastic (crispy pork, hoisin glaze, cucumber jicama slaw -- reminiscent of Korean BBQ), the chunks of meat were so big that it became difficult to eat the taco itself. The last chunk of meat in the taco was inedible for me, as it was all extremely tough and I couldn't chew it. If the meat was broken into smaller pieces in this taco, it would have by far been my favorite! 

And also, since it was my friend's birthday, our waiter bought us a round of tequila shots! I think they normally do a free s'mores dessert, but we were just as happy with the tequila shots that went down real smoothly :)

Overall -- the atmosphere inside of Bel Air is great, the food is wonderful, and the staff is friendly regardless of how busy they are. Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Food was underwhelming and poor quality; we ordered fajitas and guacamole. Service was nice, but sooo painfully slow. I would not go back nor recommend it."}
{"text":"I once loved this place. No more. It's the hurry up and WAIT, WAIT and WAIT some more. Kitchen and server was beyond slow. Chips were STALE and food was barely lukewarm. Seriously, your going to get shut down by the health department if you continue on this path!!! Sooooo disappointing. 

On the positive note, margaritas ROCK!

Ok...so I will be back cus I'm not a quitter and wait till a restaurant gets 3 strikes before I give up. Hopefully they improve by our next visit"}
{"text":"Overall, I had a good first experience at Belair Catina. We went with a group of 10 on Tuesday night, when they have 2$ select tacos. The place was pretty busy and our waiter was pretty quick. I ordered 2 of the spicy pollo taco (2$ on Tuesdays). The tacos came out fast and tasted good, no complaints. If you order 3, rice and beans are included for free. I also got a strawberry margarita, which was one of the better margaritas I've had in the downtown area. After we had eaten and were still finishing our drinks, my friends ordered another taco and dessert. The dessert was forgotten and had to be asked for again, while the taco never got to the table at all and my friend had to ask them to take it off the receipt. The place was pretty busy with the 2$ taco Tuesday special, so these items must have been forgotten about. 

The inside is very large and plenty of seating, although there was a wait when we arrived. The place can be pretty busy on nights with deals. Overall, the food was good and there were a couple menu items I will come back to try. The margaritas were great- I would come back just for the drinks. This place is like a more upscale of the Diego's that used to be on State, but still very reasonable with prices. Definitely will come back to Belair Cantina again."}
{"text":"The deals and the tacos are the standouts here, everything else is \"just ok.\" I was really excited to try Bel Air on the square because I'd been to their Milwaukee location and absolutely LOVED it. Our visit on Taco Tuesday last week was fun, but not out-of-this-world. Our waitress introduced herself as our \"taco tour guide,\" so there's that. 

I was a little bummed to see that ciders and wine (aka anything other than beer) were $7, while the beers were on special for $2. I know beer is cheaper universally, but really? It's quite the chasm between the two items. I settled for the $5 margarita special (strawberry!), which was actually quite good. 

We got 2 rounds of queso: one regular and one with lobster/shrimp. Don't bother ordering the one with lobster in it. I'm not sure if it was missing or simply undetectable, but it tasted the same as the regular queso. They did put a few chunks of lobster on the top, but it was still a waste of money if you ask me.

Taco Tuesday? Heck yeah it was. $2 for *select* tacos and tamales on the menu. I got the port-queso, soy chorizo, and black bean tamale. Since I ordered 3, I got rice and beans fo free. It's worth noting that the port queso was AMAZING: a clear standout for the night. I don't totally understand the reasoning behind which tacos are eligible for Taco Tuesday and which ones aren't (it doesn't seem to be the regular menu price). I swear the Milwaukee location had more TT tacos available as well. 

Bel Air has a large outdoor patio and we were really excited to sit outside (even if it was 1 hour 20 minute wait), so we brought our dog. I thought I should check ahead of time to see if dogs were welcome on the patio, so I message Bel Air's Facebook page (which says they \"typically answer messages immediately\" 4 hours before we went. We didn't hear back and the host informed us that dogs weren't allowed as we sat down. So after waiting an hour for our table, one of us ran the dog back home. 

Overall, it was a fun night. I'll probably stop back on another one of the deal nights. I don't think Bel Air has won my top spot for tacos yet, though."}
{"text":"There was a great deal on tacos when I came, so for 3 tacos, a margarita, and chips and salsa, I only paid about 12 dollars. PSA the salsa that comes with the chips is incredible--I could eat an entire jar of it!"}
{"text":"Great service. We had a party of 8 and they were very accommodating. The waitress messed up my order and had to wait for it to be remade while everyone else got their food. However they were really fast about delivering. They didn't tell me but when I received my check the food was on the house. Truly appreciated the service and how well they take care of their customers."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch at Belair Cantina on a Thursday. The place was full, maybe because many of their tacos are only $2.00 on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

The complimentary tortilla chips were very good. They were served with three tasty accompaniments. I wish the server had time to explain them to us, but he was busy, busy.

I tried the Shrimp Burrito in a bowl. I really enjoyed the numerous tastes and textures! It was fairly large, but maybe I just ate too many chips.

We also ordered guacamole and an order of Queso Quesadillas with Yucatan chicken. Both dishes were amazing.

My only disappointment was that it took 30 minutes to get our main dishes from when we sat down at our table. Perhaps if we would have ordered tacos it may have been faster.

One more plus: they have Fresca on tap. Love it! For those that prefer something stronger, the margaritas menu looked very interesting. Next time I may have to try a Watermelon Margarita!"}
{"text":"Great addition to Madison, especially for taco Tuesday!

When you first get seated they will bring you a free basket of chips and three of their house salsas.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, they have a special where tacos and tamales are just $2! This can also be a great deal if you order three because you get free sides of rice and beans when you order three tacos and/or tamales.

Both times I've gone, this is what I've ordered. The first time I tried the Spicy Pollo and Housemade Chorizo tacos, and the Pollo Tamale. All were delicious, but the Housemade Chorizo was definitely my favorite.

The second time I got the Housemade Chorizo again (it's what I came for), but then decided to try two new tacos as well: the Baja Tilapia and the Soy Chorizo tacos. Baja Tilapia was great (very flavorful!) and Soy Chorizo was pretty good, but I definitely prefer the Housemade Chorizo version.

As far as the sides go, the rice is very tasty and for the beans you have two options: either pinto beans or a black bean mash. I've tried both now. The pinto beans are alright, but not very flavorful and they have bacon mixed in with them if you're vegetarian. The black bean mash seemed to be meat-free and was much more flavorful and delicious!

Overall, they have very friendly waitstaff, as well as a very adorable interior with fun patterns on many of the tables. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Boy this place was busy when we went. It was a 45 minute wait, but we were able to snag some seats at the bar. 

The El Primo margarita was very smooth going down. I liked it much better than the Fresa Fresca that had a bit of a smokey flavor. 

It was so busy the bartender forgot to get us chips until we asked. The chips came with 3 different salsas - green tomatillo, mild roasted salsa, and the hotter cheesy salsa. I liked the mild and hot one though they all could have had even more flavor. 

I ordered the 3 tacos that came with beans a rice. I chose the ninja pig, carne asada, and the spicy pollo. The best of the 3 was the ninja pig. It had a sweetness to it but the meat had a good flavor. The carne asada was missing flavor. Adding some of the habeñero salsa helped. Lastly, the spicy pollo was a little spicy but the chicken was dry. 

Overall, I did not find anything special about the food that would have me traveling back here."}
{"text":"I got the mushroom, tilapia and brisket taco. The tilapia and brisket tacos were a bit dry and needed more flavor but mushroom taco was on point. I would get the mushroom taco again if I were to come back. 

The chips and salsa that came as apps were really good!"}
{"text":"I'll say this - their tacos have amazing value. It's not your authentic Mexican from Guadalajara tacos, but it's Tex Mex, i-can't-believe-they're-so-cheap-for-their-taste tacos. 
It's in a great location and would be conducive for dessert/bar hunting after a night of sumptuous dinner. 
Their selection is pretty good, and for avocado aficionados like me you'd love this place. 
The place send to be popular among college kids and the decor is modern hip. Their Tuesday special is especially good and nears can't miss territory. 
Would recommend it for someone craving Mexican, but not authentic and don't want to pay a lot of money.."}
{"text":"While in Madison recently for a tour of the state capitol, we were able to cross another restaurant off of our list by visiting Bel Air Cantina Madison. Hubby and I are huge fans of Bel Air, and have always had a great experience at their other locations. This visit was no exception. 

As with their other locations, the Madison location is spacious, with plenty of seating at both the tables and the bar. We opted to sit at the bar during this visit, and were promptly greeted by the bartender. After taking our drink orders, he brought out tortilla chips with 3 different dipping sauces. The green sauce is my personal favorite. 

The food here is delicious, with a large variety of tacos to choose from. Ultimately, I stuck with my favorite taco, the Carne Asada, which contains steak, onions, and cilantro. As usual, it was a winner! The steak was tender and flavorful. The onion added an extra kick to the tacos, which was fine by me. I absolutely recommend coming here for the $2 tacos on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Just a head's up: not all of the tacos qualify (the ones that do are marked with a \"t\" on the menu). Even so, there are still several options to choose from for the special. 

On Tuesday & Thursday, you can get select beers (Modelo, Dos Equis Amber, and Paloma) and mystery tequila shots for $2 during happy hour (M-F 3-7pm). They have other specials throughout the week as well. 

If you're not in the mood for tacos, they also have fajitas, burritos, tamales,and soup & salad. And, they have a brunch menu now, too, for all you brunch lovers (myself included)."}
{"text":"Love this new place!! I understand what all the hype is about now!

Stopped in around 6:45 on Friday and it was relatively busy. Put our names in for a table, they said 15 minutes but I think it was closer to 25. No biggie though. They text you when your table is ready so that's convenient. We were able to get spots at the bar no problem. 

When we were taken to our table our server was great. The booth we got was awesome, very large and comfy. 

The food was delicious. The chips and dips we got first were great. The black colored dip was a roasted something or other and it was amazing! We also orded queso which was sooo good. Pro tip: dip in the queso first then the black roasted stuff; amazeballs.

I went with the three taco option which comes with rice and beans. Each taco was different and each one was very good. The Barbacoa was by far my favorite and I definitely recommend it. 

The interior is decorated colorfully and is very interesting to gaze at. The bathrooms are nice with spacious stalls. Bathrooms also feature Spanish lessons to. Spanish phrases spoken by a male voice and a female voice then translated in English. Super quirky and fun! 

Corn appetizer, I forget the name of it, is also really tasty. Try it!"}
{"text":"TLDR:
Excellent food. Large portions. Easy on the wallet. 5 stars for what this place is trying to be and what it actually is. 

Full Review:
After painstakingly going through pros and cons of which restaurant we wanted to go to on our cheat day, my wife and I decided to finally make it to Belair Cantina on MLK. We left uncomfortably full and I don't regret it for a minute. 

We were seated immediately and the atmosphere of the restaurant we as quiet and welcoming. Maybe it was because we went on a Wednesday evening, but I was expecting it to be a little busier. The waitress brought out some warm tortilla chips and a  set of three sauces. Due to lack of Mexican food knowledge...I'll just call the sauces green, orange, and brown. Being on a carb-deprived diet, those hit the spot.  We then got the $12 \"Triple Ceviche\" appetizer. I wasn't expecting it to be that good...this is Madison after all...But the portion was huge and it was delicious. I think it was lobster, shrimp, and octopus if I'm not mistaken. 

My wife ordered 3 tacos (ninja pork, Korean beef, and something with mango) and she loved all three. When you buy three tacos (each priced separately) you get rice and beans free. I opted for the shrimp burrito. By that point, my eyes were bigger than my stomach so when it arrived (about as big as a Chipotle burrito) I knew it would be a struggle to eat it all. But...I did. Because it was that tasty. Could maybe do with a sauce on top, but I just added some leftover (orange) chip sauce and was good go. 

TBH, I wasn't expecting much going in there, but as far as Mexican food in Wisconsin goes...I give this place a 5. Oh, and the bill didn't make me want to vomit...$47 after a generous tip. 

We will definitely be going back. And on a Tuesday or Thursday for $2 ta"}
