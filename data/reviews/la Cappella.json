{"text":"Terrible service. We were told 20 minutes for takeout. The bland, luke-warm food was not ready for 51 minutes. Management made no attempt to appease; we complained in person. So, here is your 1 star..."}
{"text":"Service and staff were great!! Their food, however, is falling short of good. I remember years ago I went here and it was good! It took 10 minutes to get our drinks after we ordered them. My boyfriend's Mojito tasted tart and sour...nothing like what a mojito should taste like. It seems like this place is starting to fade away. Fried ravioli tasted like they were packaged frozen. Their Fried Chicken Sandwich had a burnt taste to it and the cheese \"melted\" on the sandwich resembled a piece kraft singles. The atmosphere seemed stale and bland. But the only exciting thing about here was the staff. Probably the last time I'll eat here. So unfortunate."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times over the last couple of years and have always wanted to return...  after our meal there today, I will not be going back.  The food was terrible."}
{"text":"Special place.  Owner is delightful and frequently present.  Outdoor dining can work when weather is right.  Good food and beers. Very comfortable place for family dining."}
{"text":"In general, the food is good.  Pizzas and flatbreads often have burnt crusts.  When I questioned the server about the burnt black crust on the Tuscan flatbread, she told me to \"eat around it\"!  On another occasion when I pointed out the burned pizza crust, the cook came out and said, \"That's how we do it\" or in other words,  if you don't like it, you know what you can do!  In all fairness,  a couple of the servers are very accommodating and pleasant, but some have a condescending attitude that is not acceptable."}
{"text":"A big, big fan of their pizza. Wings are solid too, I just prefer delivery over dine in any day of the week! I think they're guys have the best pizza in Fox Chapel for delivery. Haven't eaten inside for awhile, but again, I reiterate, order the pizza and wings/ appetizers section and you will be content. Family run business who are terrific people striving to improve your experience! Love this place.'"}
{"text":"La Capella is a great spot carved into the old Phar-Mor in the Waterworks. 

Why their pizza doesn't make it on Pittsburgh's list of the best pizza is beyond me. Their Sicilian crust with pepperoni, mushroom, basil, and roasted red peppers is amazing."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to dinner at la Cappella on Saturday night.  I checked in from the no-wait app, which stated there was a 5-15 minute wait.  We got there at 9pm to find the restaurant predominantly empty so I'm not sure why there was a wait listed at all.

We were sat immediately and greeted by our waitress.  She took our drink orders and we put in an order for an appetizer as well.  Our waters were delivered quickly, but my sangria took another 15+ minutes.  We ordered our dinner before our appetizer came but it still took almost an hour for our dinners to be served.  The food was hot and decent enough, but there were 2 other occupied tables in the entire place.  I'm not sure why the whole process took so long.

Our service was slow.  Our waitress disappeared for a good 15-20 minutes and we sat with empty glasses waiting for water refills with dirty dishes all over the table.  Numerous other servers walked past and could see that we were thirsty, but instead talked amongst each other and with the hostess.  I know it was the end of the night, but it was a good impression at all.  I can only imagine what the service is like during busy times!

When we got our bill I was surprised at how expensive it was for what we received- one drink, an appetizer, and 2 dinners was $65!!  I wouldn't have minded so much if the service was prompt and the food was better than just average.  We probably would have done better at the Olive Garden.  

Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I went for lunch and got the combo.  The italian hoagie was good it would have been been without raw onions that were pretty overpowering, the pizza would have been better is the bottom wasn't soggy from sitting on the dish.  The salad pretty much nothing in it.  Prices for dinner seem a little high to me, but I never ate dinner there and don't know if they are worth the price. I would try it again."}
{"text":"Over an hour for 2 dozen potato skins that when I got home were not even baked.  Will never go back again."}
{"text":"Got take-out to go for lunch at work. Decent food, nothing really great but certainly not bad. I would like to dine in at some point to give a better assessment but for now a would say this is a decent restaurant."}
{"text":"Mediocre restaurant with outrageous prices and slow service. When we were seated, it took someone ten minutes to get our drink orders in even though the restaurant wasn't that full. 

Me and my friend ended up splitting the cheesy fries as our appetizer and I ordered the lobster ravioli as an entree. The lobster ravioli dish ended up being $19 and the portions were incredibly skimpy and it only came with a measly side salad. While the entree was alright, it certainly wasn't worth spending almost $20 on. 

When we got our checks at the end, the waiter wasn't even able to split the cheesy fries appetizer between the two of us so one of us had to foot that part of the bill. Overall, la Cappella was kind of a disappointment and if you're planning on dining at the Waterworks, I would go to somewhere like Burgatory or Five Guys, where the prices are either comparable or cheaper with waaaay better food."}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times and wish we lived closer.  I have had the pasta and been pleased.  I make my own and am picky but the pasta was great.  My latest though is that huge Steel City Calzone.  Boy I wish I had bought more.  Love love it and it is huge.  I have some in my freezer nearly 200 miles away. I want to eat it.  I want to save it.  I want more.  My best friend lives around the corner.  I envy her anyway for living in Pittsburgh but now that I have been introduced to this sandwich, I envy her more.  I think the prices are very fair."}
{"text":"Breadsticks were dried out, house salad was pathetic but the Caesar was good. Most dishes were overpriced for what you get. My raviolis were drowned in sauce.  Service was slow and understaffed. The restaurant needs updated."}
{"text":"I just have one thing to say about this place...Steel Curtain Calzone! 

It has three cheeses, meatballs, sausage, bacon, ham and pepperoni. For $12.99 it is highly worth it. I ate off of it for three days! 

They offer salads, soups, pasta, pizza, calzones, chicken, seafood, steak and veal.

They have a full bar with a bunch of HD TVs as well.

{"text":"Panko breaded fish smelled fishy and tasted bad.  They offered to get something else for my husband or a dessert. He refused both because we wanted to leave, but they ended up charging us $10.99 for an uneaten, fishy smelling bad tasting sandwich. I don't feel we should have had to pay for that - at least not full price. Sorry, we won't be back."}
{"text":"The waitress was great, the food was ok, and the hostess was terrible!  The manager and hostess sat 2 groups ahead of us that came in after us!  The manager gave an excuse that she can't sit too many people at once in one section.  There were only 2 in our party!  No true apology nor did they offer to make up the inconvenience.  I would never go back!!"}
{"text":"Thank you Restaurant Week!  We live 3 miles away from La Capella and did not know it existed. What a find. The lasagna was homemade- just like Mama's. This is no small thing...Mama was born in Italy!  The service was fast and friendly. Our server was Genny and she was most helpful. She was always one step ahead.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go in the fox chapel area. My boyfriend and I go here almost every weekend as our date night spot. I highly recommend the pizza and the wedding soup. The food never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Very slow service, EXPENSIVE for the amount and quality of food you get. If you \"made your own\" pasta with the options they give you, the pasta dish I would have wanted would have cost us $25! You also get a mediocre Caesar salad with wilted brown lettuce with your entree and you apparently have to order/pay for bread? 

We won't be returning"}
{"text":"I have been in here with my parents on more then a few dinners.  La Capella offers a wide range of items but leans towards a Italian theme. My biggest issues are a lack of consistency when it comes to the meals and service. 

Once again this rang true. I actually enjoyed the meal I got which was the chicken Parmesan.  We also enjoyed the pepperoni rolls and stuffed jalepino poppers. The issues were the server never cleared the plates between apps, salads and the main course. I mean I love to pre-bus...no joke I am a helpful customer but help yourself for Pete's sake. Then my bro in law gets a steak sub and fries. It looked good but the server NEVER brings the ketchup. I had to go get it. Ugh!! Collectively the table thought the portions stunk for main meal items. Well my Mom was happy but she eats like a bird. 

Ok, in general it's not a bad meal. Decent beer selection but if the service would have been good this is a 4 star review. Well it isn't."}
{"text":"They have new duct tape on the ripped booth seating. Sadly, this place has really hit the skids.

Food is decent, but service is spotty and weird. Generally, it takes way too long for a lunch hour."}
{"text":"My boyfriend's dad insisted on coming here for his birthday dinner, so we went. After arriving, I checked yelp and was instantly freaked out by all of the negative reviews. I found a couple 5 star reviews and one of them recommended the pizza- so I went with the buffalo chicken pizza. My boyfriend got the buffalo chicken wrap, his dad ordered the diablo pasta and his mom ordered the traditional spaghetti. They ordered salads which their meals, which were decent in size and they enjoyed them. The garlic bread was strange. Very greasy and the texture was off. It didn't taste like it was homemade. Regardless, I ate it, but I found myself having to wipe it off before enjoying it. The pizza itself was pretty good. Nothing to write home about, but it was definitely a good choice. My boyfriend really liked it and stole a couple pieces off me. Our server was extremely friendly and attentive to our table. Overall, the food was good but it wasn't real italian to me. Kind of a step above Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Convenient to the Waterworks Cinema, La Cappella is one of those places you eat at before or after going to a movie.  Know what I mean?  You go there 'cos the food's reasonably good. the service is quick, and the theatre's right down the street.  

Rick and I went with some friends of ours to see \"J. Edgar\" (highly recommended) and so we stopped in here before the show.  We began our dinners with the pepperoni rolls and I've gotta admit they were quite good.  We all opted for the Pasta-bilities for our dinners.  The way this works is you select your own pasta, then select your sauce.  Yeah, it starts at $11.99 but then they start charging $1.00 extra for wheat, rainbow, or tortellini pastas.  Then if you want to upgrade your sauces to Meat Sauce, Bolognese, Alla Vodka, or Alfredo, it'll run you a couple of extra $$ on top of that.  

What, are you guys United Airlines or something and you gotta charge me extra for more leg room?

Rick had the wheat pasta and I had the penne.  Can't remember what our friends had, though.  So the food here isn't what you'd get in a fine trattoria.  But it's a good neighborhood/ strip mall Italian joint and I'd say it's worth about 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Had dinner there tonight.  Service is beyond slow, food takes forever to get, and then it was slightly warm, which screams, \"I HAVE BEEN WAITING IN THE BACK ROOM FOR YOUR SERVER TO GET ME!!!\". Fries were nearing cold.  WORST hot sausage sandwich I ever had, it is cut up little \"rounds\" of hot sausage, not a whole link. The bun was not baked, it was on a cold, soft bun.  ?????  I thought this was an Italian restaurant???  Hubby's food was cold, too, pasta dish.  Pasta Figola soup mediocre, and lukewarm.  How can you say you are Italian and serve food like this.  

I walked to the restroom, through the dining room, heard another table of 4 say, \"She SAID she would be right back with the bread...well, I guess we didn't need it anyway\". This is NOT OK. 

Bad service, bad food.  The manager was working the bar, serving food to dining room, and taking phone calls, as well as working in the kitchen without washing his hands between all of these tasks, and touching the phone, etc. 

Yuck, will NEVER return for food here."}
{"text":"I love this place. Outstanding specialty pizzas, I've never had anything here that wasn't terrific!  Great service too."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place has been going downhill fast. They usually don't bring breadsticks unless I specifically ask. I get the baked ziti and there is only one small slice of cheese on it, it's even melted in the square shape it came from the deli! Talk about being cheap!

They were really good, now they are just sacrificing quality for saving a few cents. It makes me sad. Going to Verona Village Inn instead..."}
{"text":"I I
Hate to be negative, but I just came from la Capella, and had mediocre food, and awful service. Other people were having pizza which looked amazing. I had chicken piccata which was edible even though it was over cooked, and my partner had a Stromboli which she said was not bad. The wait staff needs some lessons on having a little class!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from VA and went based on a suggestion from a family member.  Our waitress was very sweet but clearly overwhelmed with the demands from the neighboring table.  The buffalo roll appetizer was outstanding.  I ordered a meatball sub and was pleased as was my cousin with her personal pizza.  My other cousin ordered a tortellini dish that she didn't care for and my husband took one bite of his pasta dish and opted to skip it (including no to go box).  Maybe pizza and subs would have been a better choice but at an Italian restaurant you expect the pastas to be outstanding.  Disappointing.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout pizza from here. The Sicilian-style pizza seems to be one of their specialties, so we opted for a small Sicilian with half cheese, half pepperoni. Oddly enough, the small pizza was literally just half of their large Sicilian....so rectangle-shaped instead of a traditional square Sicilian. This meant that all of the pieces have crusty edges, which might be a bonus to some, but was kind of disappointing to me. I actually love the doughy crustless pieces you get in the middle of a traditional Sicilian! Ah well. So anyway, the pizza was decent, but far from the best Sicilian I've ever had. The sauce was actually quite flavorful and tasty, and there was plenty of cheese. Where it went slightly awry for me was the crust. The crust tasted slightly....stale, maybe? It was somewhat crispy, but not in a traditional crispy-pizza-crust kinda way. The amount of toothy oomph I had to give to take each bite made me feel like it was somewhat stale (perhaps it wasn't though and this is just how they do their crust). Anyway, I wasn't blown away, but it wasn't bad. Three stars and an \"A-OK\" rating seem just about right."}
{"text":"We stopped into La Capella on a recent Saturday night before a movie. We were a little skepticle of this place given some of the reviews, but we decided to give it a chance since we only planned to get a couple drinks and an appetizer. We sat at the bar and ordered a couple glasses of wine and their buffalo chicken roll.The bartender was super friendly, which I definitely appreciated. The buffalo chicken roll was yummy and the price definitely matched what we got. It was served with a side of ranch. Mmm! After we finished up, the owner passed through, introduced herself and talked with us for several minutes. She was genuinely interested in knowing more about us and our experience. I didn't really take a look at the other items on the menu, but I'd come back sometime in the future."}
{"text":"Ok the food here is AMAZING!! Everything has been really food every time we have visited. With that being said...the prices. Eh. Not loving them. Dont frequent as much as we would because of that. The other issue is the staff. Getting drink refills is almost impossible. They seem to be to busy talking and gossiping to pay attention to refills and bringing food out. And it does take a while to get your food. When we get our check and pay its even longer for them to come back."}
{"text":"Like most Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh it's Meh, not bad, edible but nothing I would go back for. The Calzone was very greasy and the mozzarella they used was very stringy making eating it hard. The veal cappella was edible with way too much peppercorns on it and it didn't make much sense to me, most places crush the peppercorns, even if to only split them in half, they simply dumped whole peppercorns all over the veal.

Prices were reasonable, food was edible 2.4 stars."}
{"text":"Nice environment. Very good service and pretty good food. My only knock is that it is expensive for the quality you get. 
I had and would recommend the chicken parm. 
I will stop back in and try something else in future."}
{"text":"La Cappella boasts itself as an Italian eatery.  hhhmm.....not really saying that it's Italian because there weren't too many Italian dishes on the menu.  We went during happy hour and had happy hour priced drinks.  
Still, the Cosmopolitan was almost $10!  BTW, you can ONLY GET HAPPY HOUR PRICES IF YOU SIT IN THE BAR.  
The food items on the menu were a bit pricey and nothing stood out for either of us so we ordered hors douvres and drinks instead.  I don't get it....Not sure what the fuss was about and don't think we'll be coming back again."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to la capella and I have to say I will not be back.  After being seated and having our order taken and drinks brought to the table right away, we waited.  When our salads and soup came to the table the salad was days old.  The lettuce was brown and wilted.  The soup (wedding) was tasteless - no flavor at all.
Then we waited and waited and waited.  The waitress never came to the table to tell us what the delay was or refill our drinks or bring my 3 year old, who had already waited too long for her pizza, a cracker or anything to hold her over because of the delay.  Almost an hour later our food was brought out.  I got the bourbon glazed salmon.  When ordering I asked what the vegetable of the day was and was told sugar snap peas (which I happen to love), when my dinner came to the table I had been given broccoli.  The salmon was just ok and barely warm.  I honestly could have made it better at home.  My husband ordered linguini with red clam sauce.  The linguini was over cooked and barely warm.  My daughter's pizza was the only thing that came out hot but it was swimming in grease.  I literally had to pat it off with a napkin to soak up the pools of grease that were on the top.  Again, the waitress never came back to ask if we needed anything, wanted drink refills etc.  The only time we saw her again was to bring the bill to the table.  Needless to say we were very disappointed and agreed that we will not return."}
{"text":"Disgusting food and people. The two fat owners are so full of them self"}
{"text":"The menu itself looked pretty good, but the food itself is a little disappointing. I thought it could be a nice place where you could go with friends or come on a date, but I found the place looking pretty childish, even the menu. (But that's just me - I guess I expect more and am being a bit pretentious.)

The meal came with a salad so I asked for the Caesar, but it tasted like the lettuces were pre-drenched in dressing so it was real soft and mushy. I like my greens fresh and crisp. 

I also ordered the garlic bread appetizer (forget what it was called exactly), and it might have been nothing too special, but it was still probably the best thing I had that night. If you want a small meal, just order a side of this and eat it yourself. It's good and filling.

For my meal, I ordered the chicken parmesan. The chicken was mushy and tasted uncooked thoroughly at some points. The spaghetti.. the noodle was a bit overcooked and the sauce wasn't that good.. overall, I was pretty disappointed at this place."}
{"text":"Wow. So, if you look at my reviews, you will notice a recurring theme - I don't tend to flame businesses, but I also feel duty bound to inform readers about the good, the bad, and the downright ugly. My experience here was the first time we've been here, and unfortunately will be the last, not because of the food, but because of the HOUR LONG wait for takeout!

The food was quite tasty, and the restaurant itself looks promising, with a well put-together menu. That's the tragedy - with service like that, I'm not sure we can keep this place in mind as a go-to local mom and pop family restaurant. Honestly, if I hadn't paid for the food the minute we walked in, I probably would have just walked out, because the wait was so long that my kids lost their cool and had to be put into the car so they wouldn't disturb the other folks eating at the restaurant.

We will likely try it again sometime, but it's gonna take time before we can get that experience out of our memory!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  They always have great pizza.  We tried the buffalo chicken rolls and they were yummy.  Always fast and great service."}
{"text":"Very generic bland food and no where near authentic italian taste, very disappointing"}
{"text":"This was my meal tonight at La Cappella. We are in town for a hockey tournament and found this place close to the rink. Some of the Yelp's were negative, but I'm here to tell you this place had excellent Italian food! Our server Jodi was very friendly & efficient. She helped me out with choosing this amazing grilled chicken tortellini bake! It was perfectly prepared, the sun-dried Tomato pesto it was topped with was just so delicious. I don't have a photo but my daughter had spaghetti and meatballs with the basil marinara, that was fresh and tasted like it came right from the garden. My daughter commented that the meatballs were as good as, if not a little better than mine! 

I would definitely recommend La Cappello's for a homemade Italian meal!!"}
{"text":"This is our FAVORITE restaurant by far. The service & food are always perfect! We have a 4 yr old & have been coming since she was born. They ALWAYS cater to her. Our must-have is the fried zucchini. Sometimes we order 2 orders because it's THAT good. The sangrias are another must have-red & white. The pizzas are thin & the sauce is sweet- just the way we like it. The wings are huge & flavorful. I could seriously suggest everything on this menu. I love their specials. I had a walnut encrusted chicken breast with white wine cream sauce once that was out of this world. Just sad it's not a regular on the menu, but that's the fun part! You just never know what you'll get each time! If you're in the area, there isn't a better place to get a meal! I noticed some poor reviews & I'm shocked. We come at least once a month for the past 5 years & LOVE it. I won't go anywhere else in the Waterworks area & we live within 5 miles. The other places are way too pricey & greasy. This is real food & real service.!"}
