{"text":"Five star for food and value. Go here for the breakfast. Not not use the restrooms. They are down steep cluttered steps and very dirty and not maintained. Both the steps and the restrooms."}
{"text":"Love this place. I've work around the block for a couple of years now, and this place is a popular place for lunch, though it is open for breakfast as well. The work lunch crowd line up can get huge around noon, but that's ok since I usually go at 1. The food is tasty, prices are very reasonable, service is friendly and quick and the selection is good for a little brown bag lunch diner. The daily quarter chicken dinner special is really cheap and super fast. Update: The place was more smoothly run  by Leo the previous owner, but it's still pretty good."}
{"text":"Great and cheap little greasy spoon with some exceptional service and good straight up simple food with barebone cheap prices.  I love the old school decor just because it reminded me of sitting at my grand parents kitchen table waiting for breakfast"}
{"text":"I'm giving them one star back for the great beef barley soup I ate on Wednesday. So full of meat and veg! I still miss Leo, though."}
{"text":"Leo the Mustache Man has sold Zupa's and this place has gone a bit downhill. I'm not ready to abandon it completely but with Corned Beef House moving even closer to me and the quality going down at Zupa's I may be calmly deboarding via the nearest exit. 

Still the only place around with a breakfast burrito though...still tasty and big."}
{"text":"I met 3 friends here for breakfast this morning, but if I tell you about the food or decor, I'm afraid I'd be \"burying the lead\". This place has snails, and I don't mean as a menu item! My friend came back from the ladies room and told us there was a snail on the wall. \"A live snail?\" She assured me it was, but I still had to go witness it myself.  After all, I've been in a lot of greasy spoons (see list), but never thought that a snail would be my first critter sighting. Even without the snails, these bathrooms were among the worst I've seen.  \"Dank\" is one adjective that fits.

Wildlife aside, the food was quite decent.  I eschewed the bacon that is included in the breakfast special, so the chef added an extra egg (to the standard 2) and included some sliced tomatoes.  The home fries were pretty good, and the toast average. The coffee was quite drinkable, and the server was very attentive in the caffeine department.

Zupa's is decent option in an area devoid of greasy spoons.

NB  You order at the counter, and the server brings your food to you."}
{"text":"I have never met a cup of gravy I haven't liked... and this place is no exception. I love being greeted by a man with the best moustache and then served by pleasant individuals who are eager to make recommendations if you ask. 

I usually get my staple.. Grilled cheese and fries with gravy (in a cup!)... And the icing on the cake?? An unbelievable pickle on the side.

Definitely worth checking out... Try one of their specials, I don't think you will regret it!"}
{"text":"Waking up to my first day in Toronto, Zupa was a pleasant surprise located around the corner from the hotel.  I had the breakfast special including eggs, toast, and ham.  I also tried the peameal with a cornmeal coating.  The setting was a typical greasy spoon with a friendly staff.  After a late night and an empty stomach, this is a nice warm breakfast to start the day of sight-seeing.  The portions are so large and hearty that a trip back to the hotel to digest might be necessary."}
{"text":"I ordered the \"salad and meat\" dish for lunch today using the Ritual app. I felt like trying something new and had never ordered from this place before. 

Well, this really wasn't a salad at all. It was a giant pile of iceberg lettuce with a few slides of under ripe tomato and bits of carrot and a chicken skewer. 

It came with two sauces. One resembled tzatziki sauce and the other was an unrecognizable dark, blobby sauce. I didn't dare to try it. 

I really don't recommend this place, for meat or veggie eaters. Nothing special and it left me underwhelmed."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast and it was really busy. They sell some big portioned breakfast entrees at a great price. If you're into big breakfasts, this place is for you. 

My meal was okay but I found it a bit too greasy for my taste buds. I eat relatively healthy so I notice when something is on the greasy side. As a result, I would give them 2.5 stars.

I decided to round up since I know everyone has a different preference on how greasy they like their food. Therefore, I will give this restaurant a 3 star rating because I know some people will enjoy it."}
{"text":"Got breakfast delivered from Zupa's today and only half the order came in. The delivery guy said that the restaurant must have forgotten, so we'd have to call them.

So we call them up and someone, the manager I believe, answers.

Have you ever spoken to someone on the phone who doesn't allow you to finish your sentence before blurting out a partially relevant response? Well, that was this guy.

So after some hurdles I explain the issue and the order seems to ring a bell in his mind when I mention \"chocolate milk\". That specificity prompted him to recall that he indeed forgot to give the delivery guy half of the order.

Here's how the conversation proceeds:

Zupa's: Okay, okay, it's real busy here now so I can't do anything. We turned the delivery service off because it's so busy

Me: Right, but we placed the order before then, is there anything--(cut-off)

Zupa's: Come pick it up right now, it's here right now.

Me: We're at our office half-way across town, that's why we ordered delivery--(cut-off)

Zupa's: You can have the order tomorrow, ok? Come tomorrow, thanks, bye. (hangs up)

In summary: they forgot half our order and their solution was for us to come across town or eat our food tomorrow."}
{"text":"Greasy spoon diner.  Prices are ok but I didn't leave feeling like I had gotten a deal.  The food was good, had the $6 breakfast, two eggs, toast, fries, and bacon.  I left feeling full in the stomach but not in the soul.  The two guys working were nice enough but I felt like I was intruding on them. So I left quickly after finishing my meal.  Place seemed a bit old and dirty, needs a face lift or good cleaning and some new paint."}
{"text":"Come in during lunch and this place is packed.  I usually sneak in just before noon and order a breakfast bagel with egg, cheese and tomato.  No one in the city does it the same.  I've been trying to emulate it for years now.  I think the magic is in the iron cook top and bacon grease but I'm not sure. 
 
Hungover?  Head to Zupa's, where Leo with the crazy moustache will take your order and remember you every time."}
{"text":"I used to have a big soft spot for this restaurant and frequented there at least once a week.  My poison?  Their bacon and egg sandwich with fries.  So good.

Unfortunately, now my stomach can't handle the grease.  The food still tastes delicious, but nothing ever sits well.  However, if you have an iron stomach and are looking to get a fantastic tasting lunch with a pop for under $10 this is your place.

My 2-stars comes from a recent problem, however.  I noticed a peculiar charge on a credit card I literally haven't used in months (it hasn't been on my person, either).  After calling the bank, they told me the charge was from Zupa's, a place I haven't been to in ages.  So basically, either they have my credit card info and are playing around with it, or they're slow at processing their credit card payments and you won't see that $8 for your lunch show up until you've long digested the meal.  Either way, I'm now watching my balance like a hawk, and probably won't be going back.  Word of caution: pay with cash.

I miss Leo, the moustache man.  This place ran like a charm when he was around."}
{"text":"I go there quite often- more often than I probably should and always order the exact same thing.

I just find that the care isn't there anymore.  When anyone other than the elder Greek man makes my food, it's slightly better- but when he does, he couldn't care less how it's prepared or how much effort he puts into it.  And, what's worse, is that I can SEE in plain view how little care he has for making a good dish.  From the way they toss things around, serve things before they're ready, skimp out in ingredients (like cheese/gravy on a poutine), etc-- I'm rethinking my commitment to this place."}
{"text":"It's a certified \"hole-in-a-wall\" type of place, but that's why it was so good.

Walked in just past 11 on a Sunday, and expected it to be busy because of the $5.99 all day breakfast, but I was the only person in there.

You go up to the counter to order, and if you're staying in, they'll bring your food over.

It eventually started to get busier, so I must've just caught it before the rush. 

They pretty much serve everything in this place, but I'd seen the cheap breakfast sign a few times and decided to give it a shot.

Glad I did, because where else can you get a greasy spoon breakfast for $6 these days?"}
{"text":"It's dingy from the outside and the inside. The men inside are ethnic and barely speak English; don't let it fool you. 
I think I may have a softspot because it was the FIRST spot I tried at my job that  filled me with goodness without having to worry about consequences...and it was flavourful.

I thought I was tripping - I thought, maybe I was incredibly famished and had reached a point where anything would have tasted good - surely, a bunch of ethnic men couldn't make western food better then they can...? I was wrong. It's true. I may be biased because I am Asian and their seasoning suit more to my taste. Either way I've been back there many times now- and I cannot say I am not satisfied for the price that I pay.

I recommand it - it's a cheap greasy spoon - and though their burrito may not be as bonerific as the ones from Burrito Bandidos, they are still delicious, huge and cheaper. I feel that you really get the bang for your buck - which is rare in this part of town, and why it's getting a 4 star."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch because the prices seemed pretty reasonable for the area. Upon entering I got a fist bump by an old guy at one of the tables and thought he must be the owner or something. anyway I thought it gave the place some character. Looking behind at all the prepared food in the background I started to get a little concerned. I decided to try the pork souvlaki dinner. The pork had clearly been cooked some time ago, was extremely dry and didn't taste all that great. The fries taste like McCain frozen fries, the rice tastes old and a bit on the hard side & the salad was awful too. I couldn't even finish and am now kinda worried I may get food poisoning due to their unclean kitchen. I shoulda known when I saw the prep area but I took a chance. I guess the saying rings true with this place, you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"4 stars and here's why. I popped in this afternoon to escape the cold and a greasy spoon, old skool diner wasn't what I was looking, for but it's what I needed - i just didn't know it.

The place wasn't busy, but the service was friendly  and efficient, and the food totally decent, cheap, and abundant. Where else in King West area can you get a full breakfast for $5.99? 

The cherry was when this rather old, and hunched-over gentleman with a cane came in for his weekend breakfast. His name is Mort and he is clearly a regular. 

As Mort took his seat he apologized for sitting at the table in front of me with his back to me as he would have preferred to face me so we could have a conversation. (Does it get anymore classic and charming than this? Not really).

He dropped his cane and I asked if I could help him and he said: no, I'm able with cane.

After a brief pause, we both burst out laughing. Cuz Abel and Cain.. lol!

He was impressed that I got the reference and was like: College educated? Me too. I have good feeling about you. I know people and I have a good feeling about you. Then he fist bumped me.

Then he asked if I was an opera fan. I said, no. He replied: so are you a Sally Rand fan? 

His friend asked if I knew who that was. I said no. Then Mort goes:  if you don't like opera u must like Sally Rand. She was as a nudie dancer. In the 30s if you asked someone if they liked Sally Rand it was, what do you call it? A JOKE!

Outstanding.

If Zupa's is good enough for a class act like Mort, then how can any of us go wrong?"}
{"text":"The price is right and the food is good but the place is not a \"greasy spoon\" ... It's just dirty. 

I admit, this review may sound a bit snooty... It's possible that the passage of time and a steady pay-check have changed my perspective. I'm sure I would have loved a place like this the (late) morning after a hard night of bar-hopping in my early twenties, but I'm over it. I like my restaurants to at least pretend to have a high standard of cleanliness. 

What am I talking about? Look at the signs, the light fixtures, the floor ... anywhere really. The cobwebs, dead bugs, and a layer of grease over everything may discourage you from ordering; perhaps that's why they want you to head for the back counter to order when you enter. 

With that said the food was good. I had the eggs Benedict and my wife had the chicken souvlaki. My dish was well prepared but my wife's chicken was a bit over cooked. The people that work here were quite friendly and accommodating. The cook even took time to make the rounds and chat-up the regulars. 

Over all it was a good experience I just wish the place were a bit cleaner."}
{"text":"Before I jump in to this greasy spoon review, I need to warn you... There is nothing nice about this place. It's a bit grimy, very old school and nothing even close to fancy. I, however, have a huge soft spot for places like this. You have to hand it to Zupa, they're holding strong in one of the priciest hoods in town, doling out cheap lunches daily.

I had the poutine (a sloppy salt pile, gross but I loved it) and a greek salad (decent). My baby daddy who works nearby had the club sandwich. He loved his club so much he's been back since for one. He, too, has a soft spot for weird, greasy spoons."}
