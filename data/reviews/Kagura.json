{"text":"It looks like they're still working on some renos here. The food is quite tasty, but a little on the pricey side. Staff is very attentive, the chef made a couple  changes we need for our diet. We went early on a Saturday. It wasnt't bust at all.   The location is on tye back side of the Yellow Univesity City condos. Parking wasn't great but I expect most will walk from the complex."}
{"text":"Went at 1:00 on a Friday. 4 other diners only, so definitely not busy. We waited to be seated, waited for water and menus, waited for her to come back to order, waited for bill... Very slow service all around, considering she didn't have a lot of patrons. The food was good. Sushi rice was good, seafood quality was good. Not spectacular, average quality and pricing. The sushi came staggered, and nicely presented with each type on its own plate. I would hate to be the dishwasher! My son had chicken fingers and fries. The fries were beyond salty. All in all a good neighborhood choice, but not a place I would go out of my way for if it wasn't convenient. I wonder how long they can survive with that giant space and no patrons."}
{"text":"The exact ramen I ordered last time didn't taste as good this time around.  The menu has changed quite a bit, so maybe management has changed? The curry was good again, but we left feeling a bit underwhelmed by everything else."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a rainy Saturday afternoon to try the ramen at Kagura. This restaurant is relatively new and we had it on our radar for a few weeks.  The restaurant is large and open with modern decor. I liked the feel of it, the warm woods help the large open space not feel to cold. The service was great, friendly and not overly attentive.   Ramen was what we were after, I went for the Shio ramen which had pork, seaweed, sprouts and a lightly salted broth for $12.95. I've only had ramen one other time so I'm not able to compare much with other places, but this was generous portion that came out quickly and steaming hot. I loved it, the broth was my favourite - it was seasoned perfectly for my taste.   The one thing that was a bit weird was that the menu print was really small, but that didn't matter compared to the big flavours in my ramen."}
{"text":"I came for lunch after reading the reviews on Yelp. It's a Tuesday, and I arrived just before noon. The restaurant it self is large and airy, with televisions on the wall. It looks like the restaurant itself isn't quite finished, the stair case leading to the upper level still had grinder marks left where the welds are. That being said, it's still a nice space. Our waitress/hostess (Ai) was very friendly, and the food came out in a timely fashion. My uncle and I ordered the miso ramen. It was tasty and came with a couple of pieces of pork. Other ingredients in the soup were, cabbage, mini bok choy, corn, half of a  hard boiled egg, and the obvious. I can't comment on the other menu items, as I only had the Miso soup. Oh I almost forgot , I did have the dragon roll. The roll itself was very fresh, but my only complaint would be the size of the roll itself. Although the roll itself was relatively cheap, the roll was on the small side. However that doesn't deter me from coming back.  I'll be back with the rest of the family to try the food again in the near future. On another note, Ai the hostess was very nice to talk with.:-)"}
{"text":"First time coming here tonight with my parents, the waiters were phenomenal. The food was fairly decent,but what stood out the most was the tempura and the tonkatsu, which was well made and presented! The only concern I felt like I need to state is that, the manager is absolutely useless and was sitting in the main dining area on his computer for the duration of my stay. It was around 6:15 when I arrived and he was already sitting around. The team of waiters was awesome but in my personal opinion, the management staff might need to reconsider this guy's position, he should really do something that can optimize and utilize his staff a lot more efficiently."}
{"text":"The sushi & sashimi are more expensive compared with Kinjo. Ramen is just so so, merely miso soup or salt soup as the base. Pork in the soup is cold."}
{"text":"We dropped by on a Saturday afternoon for lunch.  It was my first time at the restaurant but my wife had previously went with her family about a month ago.  The restaurant is large with tons of tables.  Only a few of the tables were filled during our time there.    I ordered a bento box with sushi, sashimi, and tempura.  I had Zipang for lunch the day previous, so my review might be a little bias.  The nigiri sushi rice was a little too large and too tightly packed for my liking.  It should really be packed enough to pick up by a pair of chopsticks but falls apart in your mouth without much chewing.  The fish in the sushi and sashimi were not that fresh to be honest and were thinly cut.  The saving grace was the tempura, which I thought was quite good.      Overall, for the given price, there are better sushi options around.  Maybe their thing isn't sushi/sashimi but it makes up a large part of their menu.  To be honest, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.  If I happened to be here another time, I would order their cooked food instead."}
{"text":"I needed a ramen fix stat on a black Friday afternoon, and Kagura was close by in Brentwood. It's in the bottom of one of the university city condo buildings, and the d√©cor and space was big and modern, with high ceilings and open dining.   However, that's about where the positive experience ends. I got Ramen and a rainbow roll, and I found the price to be about 20% more expensive than most competitors for both. The ramen was lacking all of the aspects that set ramen apart from instant noodles - the broth was salty but not rich, the meat was boring, the flavor profile was very flat, and the noodles were mediocre, with an average serving size... for $13. The rainbow roll was about $10, and it was mediocre at best - the fish content could have been much more generous.   The service was great, the staff were friendly - but that can't make up for inflated prices and deflated taste.   In comparing to some of the real ramen / sushi places in the city, this place is of lower quality and higher price than the average. The only positive could potentially be location if you live close by, but it would still be a tough sell in that case. I would not return."}
{"text":"Food was passable, but get your menu shit together, Kagura!  Get rid of the card where you have to mark things, and make it so the customer only receives one menu that explains everything. Why explain no rolls on the main menu, but then have a separate cars that explains only half of them?  You can probably find better food for this price, but the place is huge, so it's never busy."}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday night. Restaurant was close to empty. Not a good sign.  While the food itself was fine, the pricing seemed very high. Our server was very attentive and a real gem!  Given the high prices I will not be back. There are plenty of Japanese restaurants around with the same quality food at a much better price."}
{"text":"Kagura is on the main level of those new University City condos.  Finally, a ramen and sushi restaurant in the NW.  It's a nice and spacious restaurant with 2 levels.  There's one section that serves more like a bar-type environment and the other half has booths, tables and half booths.  We sat in a booth.  It was about 4 p.m. when we ate at the restaurant so there was not many people around.  The kitchen is open-concept so you can see the chef making your food.  We ordered the following: - Kagura Premium Roll  -  a roll with prawn tempura and beef slices on the outside of the roll sprinkled with chopped green onions.  Quite tasty. - Beef Brisket Curry with rice - really tasty and not at all spicy.  Comes with red slices of ginger.   - Shia Ramen - big bowl of piping hot clear broth with loads of ramen, pork belly, seaweed, 2 halves of a boiled egg, green onions for garnish.  Comes with a big wooden ladle so it's easy to drink up the broth.  The broth is quite tasty and not at all salty.  Yes, we'd come back.  I like the service.  It's still fairly new.  The kitchen does not have a lot of items yet even though it's on their menu.  There is a paper menu that you tick off what you want but the items in the menu is not the same as the paper menu eg. Seared Whole Squid was not available.  Hopefully, Kagura will be full steam ahead with a fully functional menu to surprise our tastebuds!  If you go this month of February, they are giving out 10% discount after you eat.  Hurry!"}
