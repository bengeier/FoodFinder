{"text":"We ordered 2 desserts to go - a tira misu-like pastry, and a sweet custard with many flaky layers.  Both were great portions.  Biggest peeve: The server put them in a to-go container - AFTER DRIZZLING NESTLE QUIK CHOCOLATE ALL OVER THE TOP.  That would be okay if, say, I ordered a CHOCOLATE TOPPED CREPE, or maybe a latte with whipped cream and CHOCOLATE DRIZZLE.  But not on pastry.  What if I hated chocolate? Or was somehow allergic?  Luckily I was able to scrape the sugary crap off the top when I got home. They were good.  Not great."}
{"text":"As a European, I can attest that this place serves real very well made European-style crepes stuffed with a variety of fresh ingredients to satisfy any cravings. The ambiance is just amazing here! French chanson music, paintings on the walls, comfortable couches with cushions - all you need to spend a great time chatting with your friends. They also have one of the best meringues I've ever tried! However, avid coffee lovers might be disappointed, coffee is not this place's biggest strength and I'd rather recommend ordering tea for your crepes and desserts."}
{"text":"I like this place.  It's groovy, it has a nice vibe and energy, and the folks that prep the crepes do it with love.  I enjoyed my crepes.  I love the chicken and brie.  So good!  It's worth checking out.  Move over Caffe Demetre!"}
{"text":"Coffee is decent but I agree with another reviewer, they take Forever! to make a simple drip coffee. I live by here and need quick service in the morning to catch the Ttc. Once I ordered a coffee to go and it took them nearly Ten! minutes to give to me, and yes I missed the streetcar.  I'm better off spending my time walking 2 blocks to Starbucks."}
{"text":"Ordered a Cafe Latte, tea, scoop of ice cream on the side, and a \"Radical Raspberry\"   crepe. Coffee and Tea were ok and ice cream was fine but the crepe was absolutely awful. Bland throughout, sour, no hint of sweetness and the \"sweet cheese\" (being just sweetened cottage cheese) was disgusting. I dare anyone with a sound palette and ordering that crepe and tell me it's servable... disgusting. Sent it back after a few bites, no apologies and nothing was done of the situation. Overall , I would go back for a coffee but probably would never order anything from the food menu."}
{"text":"Came here after checking out some art and photography on Queen West with my sister.    The cafe is reminiscent of a cute dainty french cafe. Marble table tops, stools, couches, hard flooring and overall cozy feel was a great backdrop for a quick lunch bite.    We ordered two crepes (English breakfast and veggie crepe) as well as two cappuccinos.  Total was approx $30 after tax, before tip.    The crepes were large, the English breakfast had scrambled eggs, sausage and mushrooms. The veggie crepe had a huge variety of veggies including eggplant, artichoke, asparagus,  mushroom, olives, onions and more.  It also came with a side of salad and ricotta cheese on top of the crepe. Both my sister and I are not vegetarian but I think this crepe is something anyone would easily enjoy.  Cappuccinos were ok. Quite bitter for my taste and they were very small.  Overall we loved the crepes. Next time will try a different drink."}
{"text":"This is a great little cafe in the queen west neighbourhood. It has a very chique appeal and push the European cafe angle quite heavily. I liked how they decorated the store for the season and how cozy the place felt with red sofas and chairs around window. Very good pricing for the quality of the specialty coffees and treats you get."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with my boyfriend.  We ordered a spinach and cheese crepe and Menemen crepe and they were amazing.  We've been to many crepe places around the world and these were fresh,  delicious and the portions large. We ordered flavored lattes with almond milk which were better than any starbucks or second cup latte we've tried.  We will be returning soon. Yummmm"}
{"text":"I was looking for something to eat for dinner and I stumbled upon this place. I ordered the turkey savoury crepe and it was very tasty. The savoury creeps come with a side salads of arugula and cherry tomatoes which added a fresh touch. I ordered a latte and it was delicious.   The staff are very helpful and friendly. It is a large place with plenty of seating. With the free wifi I could see this as a great place to work from."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch and got the smoked Salmon crepe (Savory) and it was so delicious.  This is by far the best smoked salmon crepe I have tried.  The only reason I had a 4 of 5 is because they mixed up my order with my boyfriend (I requested without cream cheese) yet it was still delicious.  I'd come back here again!"}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience having a Sunday morning coffee here where it took the staff 15--15!!--minutes to serve up a cup of drip coffee.  (The restaurants wasn't even busy!)  I assumed that it must have been because the place/staff was new/inexperienced, or they were having an off day, so I came back this morning.  Still took five minutes for just a simple coffee, and the server fully forgot that there was also a croissant in the order.  Not to mention the fact that, apparently their pastry supplier doesn't make deliveries on Sundays, and so all of their pastries were day-olds.  (Rock hard day-olds at that.  I've never had a day-old so stale and tough, served cold.)  It's incredible to me that a Crepes restaurant, whose primary meal is brunch, would order pastries from a supplier who doesn't service them on the biggest brunch day of the week.  (Especially when Mabel's bakery is literally across the street!)  Great interior and atmosphere, even if the music is obnoxiously loud.  But my god, absolutely horrible service, both times I've been.  Avoid it."}
{"text":"3.5 stars!  I came here during their lunch hour. It was busy but not packed, so my colleagues and I were able to find a spot for three people. It is sort of like a cafeteria-style, similar to Williams' Cafe and Aroma, where you get your own water and you order and pay prior to getting your meal.  The atmosphere was great. Very casual yet had a sophisticated feel to it with creative decor. I ordered the smoked salmon crepe (not the breakfast one) and it was delicious! A little pricey for a bit of smoked salmon wrapped in a crepe with two pieces of asparagus though. I liked the dish so much that I went home and duplicated it in my own kitchen!  Anyway, I'm not usually in the area too often, but if I do return, this place would definitely be on one of my top places to have lunch in the Queen West/Ossington area."}
{"text":"First reason I'm giving them solid four starts - their crepes, either savoury or sweet, are GOOD, and big enough to be shared by two people (if you're not too hungry).   Second - and here comes a little story: I went there for coffee and wasn't very happy with the coffee - which was supposed to be a specialty. They asked me for feedback, and I was very honest - even gave some tips on why I thought the coffee wasn't top notch. They were very pleased I was open on giving feedback and said were going to look after it.  So, today I came back and coffee was flawless. Absolutely perfect, I savoured every drop of it. I had to ask them what were the changes, and I was told they had a technician fine-tune the espresso machine after my (and not only mine) feedback, and were super happy to listen the positive response.   They are now serving a \"Maple Spice Latte\" which I absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite! As a frenchie, finding a place with GOOD savory crepes in Toronto is no small thing but finding a place where the coffee is also amazing is priceless! Love the location and the staff is uber friendly.  I also love that they don't kick you out if you just want to work or read while sipping your coffee for an hour (or two)... my new Starbucks!"}
{"text":"Dined here with a friend and was impressed with both the ambiance and food. Clean, quick service and professional wait staff. Ordered Blinchiki to share, a smoked salmon crepe and a vegetable medley crepe with smoked salmon and spinach side salad. Portions are huge! Usual coffee and tea for drinks, which were also yummy."}
{"text":"I found the staff here to be very friendly, but the food is decidedly mediocre.  The sauce on a seafood crepe had the gloopy consistency of Campbell's mushroom soup straight from the can.  A vegetarian crepe consisted mainly of non-perishable vegetables like jarred olives and artichoke hearts.  For a recently established restaurant, the decor seems dated and mismatched.  As someone who lives near this restaurant, I wish the owners were more considerate about littering their storefront with signage: they have 2 A-Frame signs scrawled with bad puns and daily specials in neon marker, plus an 8-foot high  cloth sign emblazoned with the company's name, held in place by a sandbag.  Looks terrible is all."}
