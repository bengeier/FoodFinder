{"text":"Delicious lunch here with my daughter after our spa treatments. Menu is varied and healthy and service was great. Plus, our Groupon included lunch for each of us. Views on the patio are spectacular!"}
{"text":"We live in the boulder and have been summer member of the Golf club spa over the years so we are familiar with the property- my wife booked two massages over Easter weekend both were Deep Tissue. 50 minute massages these are not cheap massages $165. Each for this much money I would expect a wonderful experience.  My wife rated her massage as a 3 score on a scale of 1 to 10. The masseuse never used her hands - it was aweird elbow rub / my massage was just Plan Odd I nothing was even and lots of stomping around me I think she had combat boots on - my masseuse never got off the rolling chair how do you give a massage from a rolling chair - it was the worst message I have ever had in my life.  Because it was Easter and I was dealing with another reservation issue  we just wanted to eat lunch by the  Pool I was not in the mood to complain that day - I did call the spa 1 week later after we return led form a vacation I left 2 messages I am still waiting for a call back from the spa manager - regular spa representatives called me back I explained my issue and I am still waiting for a manager to call me back"}
{"text":"Perfect place to relax and unwind. Nice and quiet atmosphere. The food is delicious and light. Got the cranberry French toast and it was so good. Our server was Mihwa and she was so nice, friendly and very professional. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This review is only for the café.  Wifey and I were looking for breakfast at Boulders Resort & Spa.  There was a wait at Palo Verde, and a staff member recommended the Spa Café as the \"one place\" to get an early morning eat.  We hitched ride (free) in one of the all-electric vans to and from the eatery.  Service was a bit slow, but the server let us know about that in advance.  She appeared a bit harried, having three tables arrive at around the same time.  The menu is focused on healthful offerings.  Wifey had a latte and I a cappuccino.  Both were quite disappointing, as they lacked focus, had almost no taste of espresso, and were very heavy with milk.  The food, on the other hand, was very good: nicely plated, fresh, and flavorful.  We enjoyed the outdoor seating.  Overall a good to very good, but not excellent breakfast.  Service needs to improve a touch and the staff must learn how to prepare espresso-based beverages."}
