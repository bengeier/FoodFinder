{"text":"The burgers are probably the best burgers in Toronto. I come here all the time, their food is fresh and tasty. I love their daily specials, I recommend the Bugerito (Thursday). The Thursday special is probably the best on their menu. Price wise it's similar to five guys. This place is worth every penny."}
{"text":"It was one of the best burgers I've had in a long time. I was a little confused about the toppings so I had a plain cheese burger, but my first mouthful was AMAZING! The meat was juicy and you could taste the quality of the meat and the cheese blended in for that perfect.. it was just amazing.

I got a small fry and when it came to the table it was way bigger than I expected and they were cooked to that perfect chip stand brown and lightly salted! It was pretty amazing.

I don't know if it was because I was starving or because I really wanted a burger but it was definitely better than I expected from such a small space."}
{"text":"I love their bugerrito burger! I've tried most of their specialty burgers in the promo deal, but this one is my favorite. I'm not sure what's with the negative reviews, but this place is far better than any other burger joint in the area, especially with the 2-for-1 deal. The patties might be somewhat thin, but the unique burger combinations make up for it. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pros: 
-fresh ingredients=fresh tasting burger and fries
-good selection of free condiments and toppings

Cons: 
-at this price range none

Bottom line- Probably best tasting burger place in the area and an unbeatable value for quality ingredients.

Other yelp reviews are pretty accurate on this place. Their standard beef burgers are fresh, tasty and definitely great value for the money at $4.99. The meat is fresher than Five guys and hands down tastier. Yes they use Wonder bread buns but for the price how can you complain. I would definitely choose this place over other gourmet burger places I have tried. The ratio of meat to bun to condiments was just right. Not too much meat and not too much bread.

This burger joint is definitely serious about preparing fresh food and it shows in the taste. The meat patties are freshly prepared and even their fries are freshly cut-despite not being entirely crispy were still great tasting fries. 

Will have to come back to try their fried fish burger which I noticed was prepared fresh as well. They have a buy one get one free special everyday but probably only for limited time since they are fairly new."}
{"text":"Bad. We walked into the dingy establishment and were greeted by silence from both staff members. After perusing the seemingly impressive menu I ordered onion rings and the burogie - a burger topped with coleslaw and a latke. The order was ready in a few minutes and served to me on a tray absent of paper lining. As there was no condiment station I asked for some ketchup for the onion rings and the lady behind the counter handed me the squeeze bottle of ketchup used for burger prep. I sat back down to dig into the food and was completely disappointed. The onion rings were OK but clearly purchased frozen from a manufacturer likened to McCain. And the other portion of the meal was the dry, lacklustre \"micro-burger\" ($10!), which I'm sure could have sat very comfortably in the palm of my hand given its size. A total ripoff. Overall, way too expensive for what you get (you can't charge average prices for subpar fare), and the ambiance was cramped and unfriendly, with employees completely detached from and inattentive towards the customers. I would say that this place may only potentially merit a visit (for takeout) during hours when the daily special offer is valid (2 for 1 burgers until 5pm), and only if you happened to be very close by. But I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Firstly the service was good. Not spectacular but pleasant enough. I had the Triple Threat Burger which was sooo amazing. The bacon and the patty were cooked to order so the food was nice and fresh. That's one of the biggest pluses for me.

The fries were sub-par over-cooked and a little soggy with oil. Which is why they lost a star in this review. 

They have a wide range of great toppings. I would definitely go back for another burger. Overall I would say it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Amazing burger and great selection of gourmet toppings. The beef patty is good quality and charred to perfection. I also tried the cod fish burger, it's like no other fish burger. Juicy cod stuffed with shrimp and cream sauce, light and crispy batter on outside...yum! I don't feel guilty coming here as I can see the chef rolling the patties and using fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"A tasty new Canadian standalone Burger joint! Although JACKSONS BURGERS' themed Burgers are delicious and original, they're daily specials are now only available during a short window of time so we've stopped going there to eat as its not convenient and paying full price is not worth it when there is so many other affordable options for burgers downtown. My personal favorite was their Polish inspired Burgogie and  they do have some of the BEST fries in the city! Wouldn't be Canadian without friendly staff and great service! Note that orders can take a little longer because ALL burgers are made fresh on the spot which is a good thing and rare these days!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent place, they used to have buy 1 get 1 free all day, but now they only do it from 3pm-5pm, which is very inconvinient hours for most people."}
{"text":"First time trying g this place, ordered on the Ritual app. When I got there with a friend, food was ready and hot. Ordered the Burgerrito and a large poutine. 

Burger was amazing. Cooked well, beef was delicious, went nicely with the condiments and vegetables/avacado. Added a tomato on it. 

Poutine was average, a bit small for a large. Friend had the Canada burger, said it was good. 

Overall, good atmosphere, good service, really good burgers, but pricey."}
{"text":"i have absolutely no clue how this place gets good reviews.... in fact, i am so dumbfounred i think i'm gonna give them one more chance.  i was there late at night and maybe the cook was new but i am still upset with myself for NOT complaining... i had to catch the subway.  My burger was BEYOND EDIBLE.  IT WAS SO GREASY AND OILY and it basically fell apart in the bun.  Sloppy joe's are more solid than that burger i had.  I felt bad so when i think he was the owner turned his back i wrapped up 40% of what was left and threw it in the garbage.  i even felt kinda sick on the subway from the grease. Beyond gross.... it was like someone was pulling a prank on me.  i will go back but i hope other reviews are sincere and not friends of the owner.  Lastly, i am far from the whiney, snooty complaining type..... but i had to leave a review... i mean eating only 60% of my burger is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Don't eat here if ur hungry. Haven't seen a burger joint with such SMALL burgers. 
Don't even buther with the industrial onion rings...
Fries are good. 
Too much ($15) for too little..."}
{"text":"Awesome place :) i go there bi weekly for either the burgeritto or the lamb burger. Its tasty and the fries are super amazing (really big portions to be labled small fries).
Service is the best. Friendly and able to keep the guest entertained.
Con
Its a small place so it can be crowded."}
{"text":"Just had their daily deal - buy 1 get 1 free burger. It was the burgeritto, Mexican inspired styled burger with a fried avacado patty with salsa. The burgers were hand made - you can see the chef making them. It takes a bit longer than a fast-food joint, but totally worth it. Good quality meats for a decent price.

Tip - 2 burgers are too much for a normal person. Bring a friend and pay only $5 for a premium burger."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Huge portion of fries. Don't order a large unless you a total fat bastard."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of good burgers and have wanted to try this place since it opened. However, when I finally did, I was very disappointed. I'd describe the burgers as mediocre, but the fact that this location is understaffed or inefficient is what made the experience really unpleasant. Having to wait for 2 burgers for 30 min after the order at 4pm when the place is practically empty is just not good enough for what's supposed to be essentially a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"I only come here for the daily specials since I think their regular burgers are a little overpriced. That said, the daily specials are an EXCELLENT deal for what you get. I've made it a life goal to hit every single one at least once. Current favorites are the Burgerrito and Fish Burger. Wait times can be a little long, even during non-rush hours, but if you're not in a rush, definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Had the burgetta burger. Very different but very good! And got tons of fries (enough to share)"}
{"text":"Great Day to take a stroll on Yonge street and decided give this place a try. Pictures of the burgers looked absolutely delicious, but when I ordered it, it looked different and super tiny. I don't mind if it's small as long as it tasted good. I ordered the Canadian Eh burger. I couldn't taste the meat because it was about 1/8 inch high, 
The cheese was over melted on the griddle, bacon was not crispy and the worst part of it all was the bun. The bun was moist and soggy. The bun wasn't toasted enough. Overall, experience was not good. Overpriced for a 11 dollar burger."}
{"text":"I wish I could give them a half star because it was terrible.

Our burgers were extremely soggy. The veggie patty was the worst I've ever tried. Poutine was OK and the Nutella heaven shake was anything but heavenly (also very runny)

This will be our first and last time there."}
{"text":"First off, the burgers are OVERPRICED! I seriously thought the burgers were big which is why I decided to buy the burger. I tried the BUROGIE BURGER because the of burger of the day wasn't my thing I also brought large fries but changed it to small size and the cashier gave me attitude because I gave her the amount for the large fries. I CLEARLY SAID \"I WANTED SMALL FRIES INSTEAD!\" (No, I didn't yell)Then I hear one of the cooks saying 'that's a lot of fries' I just wanted to leave! Clearly, they didn't respect me and think no one can change their minds at the last minute and worst part, they just put the fries in the fryer! Ok, they're done wrap my burger and but the fries in a brown box but the cashier puts the fries in WITHOUT closing the top and put it in a brown bag. I'm thinking maybe there's no lock on top of the box or something so I let it go. But once I'm at home, the box actually has a closing section on top! the cashier either didn't give a damn or just being lazy! smdh! I didn't even get to the burger! The burger was SMALL and SLIGHTLY BURNT! If I didn't spend over $9+ for a burger or extremely hungry, I would've thrown it out from the first bite!"}
{"text":"Had the fish burger and fries.  Deep fried fish with shrimp stuffed in was Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside but, under-seasoned. Toppings were fresh but nothing special. The Jackson hit sauce was disappointing with neither heat or acidity.  Another issue was my choice of the wholewheat bun. The bread is almost as important as the meat and there was a lack of overall flavour. Take a look at the Shake Shack and see how the bun completes the burger.

Fries were of the shoe string variety and another issue as they were limp and soggy. No crispiness or soft interior. Lack of salt completes the dish. A large was huge and can be split between 2-3 people.

Overall haven't tried the other burgers but I can see they are SMALL.  At ~$9 a burger and Wonderbread bun, it is poor value unless you take advantage of the daily buy one get one free special. Ingredients are fresh and that is standard as is the antibiotic -free beef (all beef sold in Ontario is antibiotic-free in that if antibiotics are given the animal products are not sold until they are cleared)."}
{"text":"DAMNNNNN SKIPPY.
This is one good burger. Peanut butter and jam on a burger sounds kind of gross at first, but it is actually delicious. It is one of those brilliant combinations of sweet and salty, like maple candied bacon. By recommendation of the staff, I also added bacon to the burger. The flavours all work surprisingly well together.

I came around noon on a Sunday with a group. There were no other customers when we got there so we were served relatively quickly. 

Overall, I'm impressed the by the uniqueness of this burger and how surprisingly good it tasted. I haven't tried the other burgers so I can't comment. But, service was good and staff were friendly. No complaints. 10/10 would recommend the Damn Skippy burger."}
{"text":"They've only been open a month, but I think it might be a Yonge Street Keeper. You really can't beat the $4.99 price for a beef burger. For that price, it was darn good; it had the perfect juicyness and moistness. My stomach didn't feel overly heavy after eating it. Apparently their burgers are a lot healthier than most places and they use extremely high quality product. 
The fries weren't half bad either. I have had better elsewhere, but they give you a ginormous portion for just $3.99. Seriously, I should've shared my \"small\" fries.

The boss guy is so nice and talkative. He took the time to explain what he uses in the burgers and the importance of quality. He seems to really know his stuff and I sense that he is quite experienced with the food/restaurant industry. He was patient with me and my friends as we ordered too.
(Gluten-free people: they offer gluten-free buns)

I will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Firstly I wish you could give half ratings on yelp.  Cause then I'd give this place 2.5/5 
They do seem to have a good selection but honestly the burger wasn't terrific.  
I got the veggie burger (looked like a quinoa patty)  with the basics of lettuce,  tomatoes and onions.  And then some fried cheese. 
They do have a good selection of toppings though. I loved that fried cheese was an option,  since that's rare, but I could barely taste it because the patty was so thick.  
I also got a side of fries... And man... The fries were terrible.  They were thinly cut,  which is fine,  but they were all wilted and over oiled.  I really did not enjoy them, which was unfortunate cause I was really in the mood for fries and I ate them all anyways. 
The lady who took my order was very nice and I got out relatively quickly cause I was first in line when I got in. 
I didn't eat in but noticed the layout wasn't great but was actually still similar to a lot of places in the area, as there's only a limited amount of things you can do with a space that small. 

Service 5/5
Burger 2.5/5
Fries 0/5"}
{"text":"I ordered here for lunch one day. Initially I tried to order online but it got so messy and confusing I gave up and just walked over. I decided on the Canadian Eh! burger, bacon, eggs, cheese, what could go wrong! Service at the counter was pretty good, although I have to say, the place was not very clean. I know things get messy in the food industry especially at a prime location like Yonge and Gerrard...but...the floor was gross! I got my overpriced food back to work and boy...I had to choke that burger down. The patty was DRY as the Sahara, the toppings could not make up for the beef. The saving grace however was the excellent fries! Shoestring-esque and salted to perfection, they made my lunch worth eating. Will I be back? Likely not unless I get a hankering for some fries!"}
{"text":"The burgers and fries are excellent for the price.  It takes a little while to get your burger if its busy."}
{"text":"The guy working there was very friendly, and that alone makes me hesitate to give a poor review.

I love the concept. The inclusion of gluten-free buns is great (though holy crap at the $3 upcharge).

The fries were tasty, but the burgers didn't live up to the descriptions nor the photos of the options on the wall (which showed 1/3 or 1/2 pound burgers). The size of the actual patties made McDonald's burgers look generous. The enormity of the gf buns wasn't helpful; they dwarfed the toppings and meat.

We felt really 'meh,' which made me sad and made me sorry to part with $30 for two gf burgers, one order of fries, and one bottle of water.

They could learn a lot from Roam Burger in San Francisco, which has a similar concept with excellent execution."}

{"text":"This place is pretty good! Came here yesterday and had the Bugerritto. Buy one get one free. 11.30 for both, so comes to 5.65 a burger. Beef patty, avocado explosion, salsa, sour cream, lettuce and dusted onions. Delicious! I ate both and was satisfied. I actually don't mind the wonder bread bun.  I like their bread.  I wouldnt order anything else besides the daily special where it is buy one get one free.  The regular burger at 4.99 is still reasonable in my perspective, considering it is certified localy grown free range beef that is hormone and antibiotic free. If you go to mcdonalds guess how much a big mac costs?  There is a buy one get one free for every day of the week.  If you can't finish both, go find a friend."}
{"text":"If an order of 2 burgers with a medium order of fries costs more than $30, it better be damn good. So when I got my chicken burger I was very disappointed. It was tasteless and puny. I would have much rather had spent $15 at Harvey's and got a burger with all the toppings I wanted. In a city with a so many gourmet burger places, I'm surprised that burger joints like this are able to survive."}
{"text":"Decent tasting burger. Many varieties to choose from. Best as a late-eats destination."}
{"text":"Had the Sunday special: chicken stuffed burger with spinach and cream cheese on toasted white bread with lettuce, tomato, pickles and banana peppers. $6.77 for 2 burgers! Such an excellent deal but the burger itself is even better. Amazing taste, and customer service. The chef was funny and very nice, someone you'd wanna be friends with! 

I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great burger, especially chicken! Went beyond my expectations and I can't wait to try the rest of the menu. 

Try out their burgers and it's all halal too!"}
{"text":"A friend and I had passed by about a month ago and made a note to go for lunch one day because of their Buy One Get One Deal. Out of all the days, Monday's Canada Eh! sounded the best to me so finally the right Monday came and we got to try it. For the price of $7.99 for one Canada Eh! burger, we got two. With tax it was $9.05 so really it only cost us $4.50 each. At that price for a premium burger, you really can't go wrong. We got them on whole wheat buns and they were delicious! You can definitely taste the quality of their free range beef. I would 100% get this burger again and next on the list to try is Thursday's Burgerrito. After reading some of the other reviews I think I might try their fries next time too."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best, most juicy burgers I've ever had.

This Jackson guy does it right. I love coming to a different city and seeing burger joints that know how to feed people. Just because it's fast food, doesn't mean it has to be cheap food. I mean these burgers are 5 bucks and could probably sell for closer to 8 cause they're so good for you. Usually healthy means expensive, but Jacksons gives you a great meal for a really good price.

Where else can you get a hormone free, anti-biotic free, free range burger for under 7 bucks in Toronto?? 

Whenever I'm in town, I'm planning a trip to Jacksons. Why go anywhere else when you can get an incredible mean for under 10 bucks.

Thank you Jacksons for added some quality food to this city that doesn't break the bank.

ps - reading some of the other reviews makes me wonder what wrong with some people. you're complaining about the bun, really?!? I mean seriously, do you go to a burger joint for the bun? I happened to have the gluten free bun and it was perfect. I guess some people like to bitch about the little things. Don't sweat the small stuff people, try to enjoy the quality that Jacksons offers."}
{"text":"More of a 3.5. I think my best advice for those on a budget is to come to JBs with a friend after you look at their weekly specials and decide which one the both of you are most interested in. That way both of you can get a roughly $10 burger for half that price. 

I swung by on the day where the fish burger was on special, (and regretted not researching what day I wanted to visited ahead of time), but I was still impressed with how close the burger was with the advertised picture. I remember seeing the 3 pieces of shrimp in the picture and thought, \"naw there's no way there would be that much shrimp of that size in the fish patty\".But, lo and behold there were in fact that many pieces of shrimp in there.

However, it's more of a 3.5 rather than a 4 for 2 reasons. First, the burger, was good but not amazing. Second, service was a bit lacking in terms of the attitude I received when I asked questions about the toppings (which are listed in front of the cashier) but I will be lenient on that since they were really busy that day.

I do hope to return and try another specialty burger and maybe at that time they will be able to earn 4 stars in my books."}
{"text":"Tried the Canadian burger. Bit dry and smaller than expected for $10.  Dark place with not a lot of customers and no real enthusiasm on the part of the staff to take your order. Fries were OK, not quite a \"large\" size; more like a medium.

Will try other places."}
{"text":"Juicy Meaty taste without the hangover. Caramalized onions are a must! Definately coming back."}
{"text":"Got the Canadian Burger and Poutine on seperate occasions. The $12 burger was only okay and nothing special. For a $12 burger (before taxes), I expected something better or bigger. 

My friend got a $6 milkshake that was quite small.

The poutine was also only okay. For better poutine quality and variety, go to the nearby Philthy Philly's.

I don't think I'd come back again.

Quality: 7/10. Service: 8/10. Value: 5/10. Overall: 6.5/10 (Not an average)"}
{"text":"Pretty nice burger. Got the Oh Canada (beef patty, bacon, egg and cheese). The patty was fairly thin but cooked well and the burger itself was equal parts patty, bacon and egg so the whole thing came together pretty nicely.  I think they'd benefit from 2 over a single patty so I might try that next time. Food was fresh, hot and fairly tasty though."}
{"text":"The Thursday Burgerrito is everything. 

Beef patty, avocado explosion, salsa, sour cream, lettuce, and dusted onions make for an amazing burger. $10 for two is a great deal, considering the burgers usually cost $10 each and the avocado explosion as a separate add-on is $5 on its own. (I know, I know. Things are priced a certain way to make deals more compelling. Consider me compelled.) On top of the specials, you can add however many of their free toppings: tomato, onion, lettuce, pickles, relish, spinach, banana peppers, jalapeno peppers, and cucumber. The burgers are already quite tall, but I like to add spinach and tomatoes.

I will not refute what others have said about the small buns. This is true. They are kind of pathetic relative to the rest of the burger. A bigger, crispier, toasted bun would do wonders. 

And yes, the layout of the store is appalling. It's one of those setups where you pay and then don't really know where to stand. No one knows whether you're in line or waiting for your burger. And service is slow, even when I'm the only one there. It's also small enough that I wouldn't want to eat-in. It'd be too noisy and cramped, and I don't like the feeling of people hovering over me as I eat.

However, I maintain, the burgers taste great. I don't know that I would ever buy their burgers at full price, but that's what makes their varied deals so great. 

Aside from the Burgerrito, I've tried Monday's Canada, Eh (beef, fried egg, bacon, fried cheese, mayo) and Saturday's Burogie (beef, potato latke, coleslaw, sour cream, lettuce) and was impressed by both, but more so by the Burogie. The crispy deep fried latke added an amazing crunch to the burger that I didn't know I wanted. 

Their fries are their biggest weakness as both times I've gotten them, they were soggy. The onion rings were better, but I feel like you don't get enough.

The Nutella Heaven Shake (Nutella, banana, frozen yogurt & coconut milk) is great if you like Nutella because I watched them scoop giant spoons of Nutella out of a bucket into the blender, so don't worry; you get plenty of Nutella. 

I'd definitely recommend getting burgers here. For a complete meal, I'd grab my burger and walk to the McDonald's down the street for fries and a drink."}
{"text":"I was here a couple of months ago, and had their $9.99 combo. I respect that the beef is all fresh ground and organic and all that jazz, but it was BLAND. I usually like sauces on my sandwiches and burgers, but even after drenching this burger, the patty was underseasoned, bland, and tastes like chewed up cardboard. Service was just okay, really not worth it."}
{"text":"For only $4.99, you can get a 100% fresh beef burger that is hormone free, antibiotic free ! A price for such quality meat is rare. The service was great and so was the food. Let's support a business that actually is there making good quality food for accessible prices!"}
{"text":"I love it. 
Specially the burgerziki burger. fries are delicious as well."}
{"text":"Whoa! This place surprised me. 

First off, bonus points for having what looks like a milkshake(didn't try it)(only one option tho... but it's nutella!), and awesome fries. 

The fries will remind of you of five guy's fries, but thinner, which I love. I wish more places had thin almost shoestring like fries.

Now the burger, the meat is nicely browned, lots of toppings, and the bread is soft but not so thin it will get easily soggy. Very nice burger engineering here. Topping options are awesome! Just the right amount of choices that make constructing a burger fun, and not overwhelming. 

Never tried any of the \"grilled cheese\" bread options that some places have, usually because it looks too crazy, and it really takes it beyond a burger and into frankensandwich territory. 
But this places does grilled cheese right! just regular buns that happen to have a golden crispy layer of grilled cheese on one side of each bun. It's awesome! 

I will definitely come back and highly recommend you try the grilled cheese option! it's so tastefully done."}
{"text":"Wonderbread?? Are you kidding me?

Let me start off by saying I was really looking forward to trying JB's out. I went on the day that the Mexican burger was 2 for 1. I think $10 for a burger is pretty outrageous but I went with a co-worker so $5 each seemed pretty reasonable. The service was good but we were both pretty dissapointed when we saw the size of the burger itself and the stacks of Wonderbread buns in the corner. 

The \"Avocado Explosion\" was the highlight of the entire experience. It went really well with the burger. I am a fan of the fact that the meat is (claimed to be) local and hormone free but I found it to be lacking any type of seasoning and very greasy (which took it's toll on the Wonderbread bun). 

The onion rings weren't crispy either. Just kind of soft and greasy. 

Will not be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Fresh toppings... Hormone and antibiotic free DELICIOUS patty fried crispy on a hot griddle. Excellent value!"}
{"text":"Just decided to eat here on a whim and am glad we did! Friendly staff, delicious burgers and fries. Their signature Jack sauce is soooo good. Good quality food. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feeling about this one, but I will explain why. 

First off,  food isnt the problem. The meat is freshly ground and grilled so no precooked frozen generic patty, so plus there. The topping are alot but  some have quite the extra charge like avocado but if you stick to signature as is, you will be fine with the way it prepared and taste.  Food get 4/5 for me

Its price and quantity that is issue with that give me the mixed reaction. Most signature burger are around 10 buck and the size of what you expect a double cheeseburger which are usually small in size which these are, I feel like for the size it should be 6 dollar burger at best. So if I were to just review it on that price would get 2 for me. 

But the special offer of a signature burger of the day were it 2 for 1 deal means you get 2 for 10 buck or 1 for 5 which I think is a reasonable deal. The deal is what save this place from 2 star for having overprice burgers while it still there taking advantage of the deal make it more of better deal so the get 3-3.5/5

So overall my rating would be between 2.5 and 3.5 so 3 if fair rating on this place"}
{"text":"Did a takeout of four burgers and a large fries. All the burgers were vegetarian and were Mexican, Italian, perogies style and Greek

The fries are cut too this although they taste fresh cut. The Greek and Italian lack flavour. The Mexican with bursting avocado was good and the perogies style was good as well. The burgers a bit dry as there is nothing on the buns and that makes them dry. The quinoa  burgers also need to ante up some flavour. Need a good soy burger option as well."}
{"text":"Very nice burgers.  They aren't crazy greasy and it was juicy and everything you imagine a good burger to be. I had the burgerziki. All the flavours went perfectly together. It was also the buy on get one free special. My only complaints are that the burger was smaller than I expected. They pictures make them look so much bigger than they really are. I don't think the burgers are worth their full price because for the size (I'm strictly taking about the specialty burgers). However, the small fries make up for the lack of size in the burger. They were so big and equally good. I liked that it has little salt. They were quite thin, like McDonald's fries but much crispier and better. Also, bun was still slightly cold to the touch. They really should toast them. Will come again to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Coming back for a second time could not have been better. They have definitely improved the taste of their burgers. The patty now has a crisp char and size has grown.

My burger: cheddar cheese burger with extra Jackson sauce, jalapeño, pickles, tomato. Try it for yourself.

I work near by, so I'll back soon."}
{"text":"Good home made style burger. Don't be alarmed by the size of the place and if there are no seats when you walk in. Pattied are grilled fresh, so by the time you burger is ready somebody wwould have finished thier meal. It is a tad pricey though.

Now I am fan buttery goodness, but the fries were a bit too greasy. If I had to guess the were re-fried.

I would give them another chance and get thier daily special. Speacial is buy one burger, get one free and they have different burger on special each day of the week. 

If take two goes well, I'll update my review."}
{"text":"Rudest, racist and the scariest server ever! I dropped off my parents here and left to look for parking around 11.10pm Sunday night and he would not let my parents order because apparently it was too close to 12am (closing time). I came in around 11.15pm and he was nice to me at first but when he saw my dad walk up to me, he immediately started being rude. I asked if I could have a minute and he rolled his eyes and said \"I don't have time, we are closing now\" so my little brother said to him  \"but you close at midnight\" and he said \"It's midnight now\" (it was only 11.15PM). I told him that it's not and he just asked me to hurry up. There was no one behind us and still had 45 minutes so I was confused but we ordered our food and sat down. The burgers tasted good but they were literally bite-sized. We were there until midnight and what's really pathetic is that he took 9 more customers after us without a fuss! The chef however was really quiet and polite so we thanked him and we left. 

My brother and I didn't want to create a scene (and plus I was really intimidated by the server) but we will be filing a formal complaint as my dad had a very obvious back injury and yet the server was so rude to him and to my mom. My parents are really polite, quiet and naive people so it was upsetting to see them eating in a hurry as they were quite embarrassed and distressed.

I rarely ever write a bad review but unfortunately, this was a really distressing incident, especially for my parents who did nothing but were discriminated against for very obvious reasons. 

I hope this is just an isolated incident but until the management follow up, we will not be returning."}

{"text":"Very surprised by the quality of food. 

I hadn't heard anything about jacksons burger and just happened to be walking past and decided to give it a try. The burger was really good. Not as good as a burgers priest or burgernator but a lot better than typical fast food or chain restaurants. 

The best part of the combo though were the fries. Not only were they great tasting and quality they hook you up with so much. A whole box full. I'm usually disappointed with burger joints fries. Either too little, not good quality or both but this place gets it right."}
{"text":"I had the chicken burger and it was definitely gourmet. The chicken is free range from Paradise Farms in Ontario and keeping with the Corporate Social Responsibility! Great Job!"}
{"text":"I went to Jackson burger on a Friday with a friend to try their buy one get free deal. Friday is Fish day. They describe the sandwich as a cod fillet stuffed with shrimp and cheese. Promo and tax included my friend and I payed a little over $14 which included 2 fish burgers no drink, no fries. Therefore on a regular day the fish burger would cost $14.

It took long to receive our order we watched two tables get and eat their food before we received ours. When we finally received our burger we were surprised at how tiny they were. The cod was flavorless and there was only ONE shrimp in the burger, with barely any tar tar sauce. All other toppings cost extra. When we asked how many shrimp is in each burger they said one as advertised. Which I disagree it says stuffed with shrimp not stuffed with one/a shrimp. 

We left extremely disappointed and still hungry! The sad thing is I personally believe McDonald's fish fillet taste way better and with what we paid we could of got a better tasting fish burger with fries and a drink.

The only reason I gave two stars is because the staff is extremely kind. I would not recommend this place to anyone unless they enjoy over paying for flavorless food."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had in a long time.  The beef is growth hormone/anti biotic free, from paradise farms in Ontario.  It's AAA black angus, some of the best quality meat you can get and  the quality is apparent when you take a bite.  The owner showed me his cheese, it's also expensive.  I can tell you hes not making much money at $4.99 a burger. For those who complain about the price, go to McDonalds and eat GMO.  You get what you pay for.  This burger should really sell for closer to $8.

The fries were delicious, fresh cut and properly blanched.  

The owner is just getting started so there are a few things he will need to fix along the way like putting a timer on the fries to make sure they are always piping hot.

He is experimenting with recipes and he fried me up an eggplant , cheese and mushroom patty to try. Yum!

Try the home made Jackson sauce.

I will be going back here instead of 5 guys."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger places anywhere. The \"Burgerrito\" is my favorite with a really delicious avocado patty deep-fried in addition to a tasty thin beef patty. I've tried a few other burgers including the \"Canada Eh!\", and the \"Burogie\" and they have all been great!  I also love the thin-cut fries either as-is or as Poutine."}
{"text":"Out of the two burgers we ordered - one was pretty good the other was mediocre. It seems the international burgers aren't customizable in any way - meaning no ketchup or mustard, lettuce or tomato on the mushroom and Swiss. The regular burger was good with all the fixings. 

However service was atrocious. Will not be back"}
{"text":"It was ok.  Many good burger joints out there and this place didn't stand out.
They do have some pretty good specials, if you wanted two, which is too much for me. The place is pretty small and it's more likely that I'd visit it alone.  If I was in a group or date, I'd travel to one of the better spots in the area.  Sorry..."}
{"text":"This is clearly my most favourite chain franchised burger. The Elm Street restaurant is on a nice quiet, down town street which allows me to enjoy my lunch. Excellent specialty, grass fed, international, beef burgers with a variety of fresh toppings and fresh cut specialty fries that will surely satisfy your hunger. Excellent, knowledgeable and friendly service allows you to continue on with your great day or will put a smile on your face if it's started out less than perfect. Excellent job Jackson's Burger. Keep it up."}
{"text":"Had the Burgerrito.  Very disappointing.  The patty was not very lacking and loose. They grill it so its slightly crispy on the outside which is not my preference at all.  You certainly don't get a feeling of fullfillment and satasfication after the meal like you would a good burger.  It felt more like I was eating toppings with a side of ground beef, rather than having the other ingredients  add to the experience of the burger."}
{"text":"Great little spot. Free range beef, with an awesome variety of toppings. Get the special which is a daily burger. You Tegucigalpa two for the price of one. Taste wise it's right up there top 5 in Toronto. I got the Burrogi, which has a potato thing in it. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Awesome burger.
I'm really picky when it comes to fries , these fries were great right amount of salt and fried nice ^^ will be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered a cheeseburger. It was ok, nothing memorable. Not bad but certainly not awesome either."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a bite after walking the downtown area for couple hours.  Seemed like a place that took its food serious and it delivered.  The burger had a real nice crispness on the outside with juicy bites.  Handformed patties really work with the simple hamburger bun they chose.  Had white (comes in whole wheat and gluten free), was fresh and substantial enough to hold my - and I may be paraphrasing the name - Canada Eh burger (recommended by the counter person).  Patty, bacon, fried egg and mayo.  Worked well together though the bacon was only crisp on edges as they cook the bacon on the burger and not added later. Had fries - really very good.   Would have been 4 stars but the counter person failed to ask if I wanted any additional toppings and the price point was a little on the high end of inexpensive.  Fries were good but enough for 2 people and they would be great as poutine.
Small dine in area at back of place - 5 tables for two.  Will be going back to try the philly cream cheese stuffed chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Expensive, burger was poorly made and fell apart, taste wise it was pretty much a generic chicken souvlaki sandwiched in between two buns. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Burger was nothing special, based on reviews I expected a lot better, tiny for the price.  Ordered mushrooms at extra cost and when I arrived at my destination and unwrapped it there were no mushrooms. Burger was generic, fries nothing special, will go back one more time only to let them know they messed up my order and leave, maybe they will make it right. 

Not worth the price for a four ounce patty, I asked the size of the standard patty while there."}
{"text":"This place has great burgers, a friendly staff, and gluten-free buns. Can't lose. Try the Canada Eh.

Note that the fries are not gluten-free. They also didn't know the manufacturer of the gluten-free buns, nor whether the buns contained milk products. They thought Udi's, but they didn't look or taste like Udi's to me (they were soft and delicious, nevertheless)."}
{"text":"Before the Toronto Burger Wars started, this place was the only good spot in the neighbourhood to get a fresh ground beef burger.

The burgers are good and the price is reasonable. My only negative is that I think there are just too many toppings/options, which can take away from a quality burger."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews but I felt this one needed one because of how bad it was ! 

The buns were thin and small and looked like ones that we can buy at a grocery store, which is probably why they got soggy and all the toppings literally just fell out of them. The taste was also very mediocre. Nothing special, in fact quite disappointing."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this place, the gigantic glossy pictures look great in the window and BOGO during happy hour (3pm-5pm) is an easy selling point for me.

I was quite disappointed when I got the \"swiss-made\" burger with swiss cheese and mushrooms. Small burger with a dry patty x2 makes for double the misery. I could broil a juicier patty in the oven for the same time it took for me to wait and get the burger. And the patty size - if you see other pictures indicating the size of the patty as smaller than the bun, that's what mine was like too (except my patty was too small to be seen...).

Generally, the restaurant didn't seem all that clean.

I understand that other people enjoy the burgerrito, so maybe I should get that instead next time."}
{"text":"Truly poor service at an otherwise pretty descent burger shoppe. 

I was excited to try one of their delicious creations however as a vegetarian I cannot eat a meat patty. No matter how much I tried to explai to the staff member and no matter how much money I offered for the difference (approx $1.50) they would not accommodate me. 

With many other burger options nearby I will not be coming back. Goodbye and hello W Burger"}
{"text":"I don't get these reviews. First time in and last time out. I hate to slander small enterprises. I really like to see more instead of the big franchises. Here's my review. Burgers are very ordinary as you can do at home. Ordered the basic burger and it was clearly basic. Small patties and buns are small as people have said. With two people in line (me being #2), it took almost 20 mins to get this burger ready! Way too long. And they missed putting tomato had I not keep an eye on the assembly. Watching how they kept track of the order was funny. After it was wrapped up, they didn't know which burger was which so they had to unwrap it to check. OK common sense needs to prevail. Mark the dang thing after its wrapped! So disorganized it makes me wanna cry. Toppings are expensive when you add it together. Ohh the funny part is if you buy 100 burgers the next one is free!! Economically that's something like if you spend $700 you will get a freebie. How nice...Positives. The fries look good. Maybe I should have just ordered those instead."}
{"text":"We found JBs though all the hype on instagram and was excited to try the international burgers and Poutine. I got the Burgetta burger and the JB House poutine. The Poutine was tasty with all its toppings and the burger patty was good, but there was barely any toppings and much smaller than anticipated. I reread the description of the burgetta burger and realized that I didn't even get the fried eggplant! I felt very mislead by the advertising and disappointed. I would give this company an A for creativity but I will not be coming back for an undersized meal with an oversized pricetag."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch and was the only customer. Food was ok overall, as the burger was decent. The fries were soggy and when you add it all up over $10 for a lunch combo I expect better."}
{"text":"It's our first time trying Jackson's Burger and it was great. We were pleasantly surprised. We ordered a beef burger with bacon and a bacon cheeseburger along with onion rings and fries. The buns, beef and bacon were not greasy and heavy at all. The veggies were fresh and the onion rings and fries were so good! 
We would definitely order again. 
I'm already thinking what I want to try next. Lol. 
Give it a try folks!"}
{"text":"Mediocre burgers, surprisingly small and expensive. Service is terrible"}
{"text":"Came here in  Thursday at about noon and there was quite a good lineup of people waiting for burgers, always a good sign. 

I got a regular burger combo with fries and a drink. The menu is slightly confusing in terms of the pricing for a combo and it should be clearly reworded. Take your burger price and add 4.99 to add a combo, which throws your cost over $10 right away, so unless you're getting just a regular, veggie or chicken burger, it won't be under $10 for lunch. Not a bad price, considering the serving size of fries you get. 

There was quite a wait for my burger, at least 10 minutes, if not more. They were churning them out but I found the space to be too small for that kind of wait. We were all crowded on one side and it just got more crowded as the line got longer. Come early to avoid the line and wait.

I got a combo, burger with cheese and my usual toppings, nothing from the extras menu, and fries and a drink, cost me over $12 with tax. Based on the photos I saw on the Yelp page, they've changed their fries opting for more of a shoestring fry that's fried to a dark brown. Tons of flavor and while the serving is huge, you just can't stop eating the damned fries. Far too tasty.

As for the burger, it was good, but far too small for me. I get the price is good for the serving size, and the whole better quality beef thing, but there wasn't much burger between the buns once it was flattened and cooked. Yes, it had that lovely griddled crust on it, but if you like any kind of toppings at all, the burger will get lost. If you want to appreciate the meat, try just cheese and maybe one or two toppings. Nothing about the burger stood out as incredible to me and I missed that lovely feeling of biting into a nice, thick, juicy burger (you just won't get it here). Nothing to make me think that this would be the best local burger I could get. All in, not a bad burger, but nothing to write home about. Perhaps I need to try one of the specials people keep talking about, but this place did not live up to its high yelp reviews.

For my money, I'd go two blocks north to W Burger Bar to get something more substantial. This place is a good quick stop for those days you're craving a burger, but it's not a place I'll go out of my way to get to."}
{"text":"We have been there 3x now and hae never been disappointed. Beef patties and great buns are fresh and the daily specials are made right from scratch. Service is excellent and you wil not be disappointed."}
{"text":"It's a tiny bit more expensive, a tiny bit of a longer wait, and slightly thinner buns than would be ideal but I'm a huge fan of the patty and their toppings are great. The Butter Chicken sauce on the chicken burger is delectable. I also love love love the fries but if you aren't a soggy fry fan they might not be for you. 

Don't try this place if you're in a rush the anxiety ruins the burger. The layout of the store could be better especially as winter is on us, it's a tiny eat in area at the back with a very narrow area between the wall and the service counter. As I mentioned you aren't getting out of there quickly so it quickly fills up with people waiting for their food and people trying to get to the cash and people trying to get out. All this combined with winter gear and backpacks. If it's busy I usually just forget about it, it gets frustrating quickly. However the fact that it gets that busy says something about the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Their daily specials are a bargain!  They have specific burgers for each day that are BOGO.  If you can't have something specific on the burger, just ask them for without.  And for all your friends that eat halal or gluten-free - REJOICE! I like this place because it doesn't make a dent in my pocket.  I get a decent-sized burger and my friend takes the other for $5 a burger.  Their burgers are interesting and creative and that tempts me enough to try all of them.  So far I've had the Canada Eh! (Monday) which has an egg, beef patty, bacon and fried cheese.  I've also had the Burogie (Saturday) that has a beef patty, potato latke, sour cream, and coleslaw. Canada eh! was good, but greasy.  Definitely have it hot because if it's cold it'll taste ick. Burogie seemed like a package of awesomeness because I love coleslaw and potatoes, but it disappointed.  The latke was hard and I couldn't taste the coleslaw. 

The staff was nice.  Cooks are a little succinct, but the cashiers are a lot more friendly and patient. Seating area isn't big, but people clear out pretty quickly after their meal.  So finding a spot to eat shouldn't be too difficult. My overall take on this place is that the price is unbeatable for the daily specials and staying open late.  I'd head back here just to try the other burgers to see if I scrounge up a winner or if I'm out on a late night. However, I definitely prefer my other burgers."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 burgers and a poutine. The Burgers were maybe at best 3/5. The poutine ...well they gave us fries instead. I went back to ask for the poutine/refund. They couldn't find our order. NTS keep all receipts especially to garbage establishments like this."}
{"text":"Disgusting !!!   Shame on me.  I went there last year when it was right on Yonge Street ( if that's the same franchise)  and it was late.  Unfriendly staff cooked me a burger that was beyond greasy.  The burger fell apart.  No flavour yet so greasy.  Last night i was downtown and i seriously had to go to the bathroom , i saw Jacksons Burger on Elm and seriously said to myself \" ah crap , well i gotta take a leak, i'll just buy some fries\"  so i go in, once again unfriendly staff , not rude or anything but not friendly , i order a poutine and diet coke, got no problem with 10 bucks cuz i know rent is expensive downtown.   This poutine was DISGUSTING .  Once again i only ate some it and threw it in the trash.  Gross gravy, cheese curds that didn't melt at all and lousy fries.  I was probably there 25 minutes in total.  I never did get to use the bathroom cuz i think drug addicts were in there. I could care less about the customers , i could care less about the price, but gross food and unfriendly staff?  Ya right ..... Never going back again."}
{"text":"Tried this place out after seeing a review of it online.

For a $4.99 burger, it ain't so bad! I'm happy to get good meat for a good price.

Pros:
Good location, good service (not a lot of customers), and good variety of sides. I also love the idea of fresh-squeezed juice, although I don't know how that matches with burgers (weird).

Cons:
It's a $4.99 burger. Only eat here if you don't have another choice. I would not call this a gourmet burger place because some of the items just don't make sense. I mean, you just slap a piece of salmon on a salad without even thinking if it goes together with the rest of your menu? The buns in this place look like death too. I'll bring my own bun next time haha!

All in all- not a bad try. I wasn't expecting anything more than average at this location. M'eh."}
{"text":"Tiny burgers and staff can't seem to understand add-on toppings. Got a regular to add this butter chicken sauce...never got it. $5.65 for mine and nearly $9 for his. Bf got a burger with bacon and cheese ($2.50) and forgot both add ons. Finally got bacon but still forgot the cheese and bacon seemed overcooked. Did the even rebook the burger for customer service sake. The Friday fish burger looks amazing but I dunno if they'll pay attention. It wasn't even busy all, too busy talking. Shame, I could see potential but we refuse to come back here. BIG MOE'S is next door, think it's a better option. Not even full...he'll A&W could do better"}
{"text":"I couldn't have wished for a better first visit.  We checked out the menu online after searching for a place to eat nearby.  Going there was the best move we could have made.

We were greeted by Afa...a huge smile and patience beyond anyone I could imagine, he painstakingly went through the entire ordering process and helped guide us through the full menu providing his favs but allowing us to decide our final order ourselves. Dan took to the grill to prepare our order while balancing a few others, presumably online orders and a couple of other walk-ins.  Dan even brought the meals to our table.

My burger, a double cheeseburger on grill cheese buns with a ton of toppings was amazing.  My wife described her single burger as \"delicious\".

The beef was seasoned perfectly, tasted wonderful and was not the least bit heavy.  Dan mentioned to a customer after us that he had ground that particular batch of beef only an hour before.  Trust me, it tasted super fresh and had a firm texture.

The fries, hand-cut were fabulous.  Shoestring fries couldn't have tasted any better.  My side order of gravy topped it off perfectly...thick (but not too thick) and tasty.

Not costing much more than most other gourmet burger joints, I was more than happy to pay the bill knowing I was getting quality angus beef, farm-raised, grain-fed, with no added antibiotics!

Without a doubt, Jackson's exceeded my expectations.  Considering that dinner was at 11pm, I'm more impressed that I won't be going to bed with a heavy, sinking feeling in my stomach.  This meal went down perfectly!

Looking so forward to my next visit...the menu is so extensive, I'm sure I'm in for another epic experience next time.

Thanks Afa & Dan...you guys made my dinner meal awesome."}
{"text":"I came here because there is a meat grinder right by the window and it caught my eye and appetite!  They have many trendy options for burgers.  I ordered the regular burger which they make on a flat top.  The burger was well prepared with care.  It tasted great and it was well seasoned.  I'd recommend getting a bigger burger option than the regular since it is small.  The prices are average for a freshly made ground beef burger."}
{"text":"Tired of overpriced, mediocre burgers? Jacksons Burger served me one of the best burgers I've had. Hands down. The patties are hand made fresh. They have a deal every day of the week (buy a certain burger, get another free), but the standard prices are cheaper than what you'll pay at many other restaurants for an inferior product. I love the food, and recommend giving Jacksons Burger a try."}
{"text":"Based on the great reviews, I decided give this place a chance. The burger was just OK, but at $9 just for the sandwich, I expected something more -- either better quality/taste, or something that is more filling.

I also ordered a poutine... The fries themselves are actually quite good; unfortunately, the gravy and cheese were anything but. The gravy was rather bland, and the cheese was not anything I have ever seen on a poutine (i.e. not curds, and not grated mozzarella) -- I am not quite sure what it was, but it did not work well on a poutine."}
{"text":"Ordered a cheeseburger with onion rings and a drink. The burger was very poorly seasoned and overcooked, the bun to burger ratio was very poor( meaning too much bun, not much burger. The bun was also poorly toasted, and tasteless. Overall, the burger tasted like nothing, even with all the condiments. The onion rings were very greasy, not a pleasant experience. The wait time was way too long, and since it was an open kitchen I got to observe the process. The cooks were very unorganized and obviously lacked experience. 

Definitely, not a repeat, even if you are in the area and craving a burger, go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"went out of my way to come to this place, for a couple of reasons
close to transit 
close to Y&D square
lots of options...
lots of non-beef options...

i understand what this place is trying to do, offer a supreme burger, with awesome toppings and options, for a price, which sounds great.
i think other then a mcds cheeseburger, the burger me and my s.o recieved from this place, would be about the same size. i think they're trying to maximize their bottom dollar, by offering awesome flavors, but small portions. 
to be completely fair, the poutine was a bigger portion then the burger, being a burger place i'd like to think the portion would be a bit bigger.

Excellent flavors, i was very satisfied with the flavor.
the poutine was above decent, given the size, fries, cheese and gravy. 
the staff are great, and churn out food like a military operation, which is cool.
the location is tiny as well, less then ten seats, or ten seats only. i can't remember atm. 

also i rank this a bit lower cause of the portion size, as well i don't like the advertisement of \"two minute walk from y&d square\" yeah maybe at midnight, if your doing a fast walk."}
