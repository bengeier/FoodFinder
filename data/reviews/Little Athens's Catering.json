{"text":"Super food! Very well done Greek fare. Very good quality, great  prices. I grew  up near Ambridge, know  their long standing good reputation for excellent  food & service.  I would  highly  recommend  that you look for them at the Green Tree Farmers  Mart & other locations. A wonderful selection of authentic entrees & sides  and fantastic desserts. Very friendly, good people."}
{"text":"I usually catch Little Athens on Fridays in Mellon Square for lunch.  Their Greek Lemon Soup is phenomenal.  Their stuffed grape leaves are huge and tender.  As a fellow Greek I can say that I have tried a lot of different Greek food from actual Greek restaurants in Greece to moms home cooking and little Athens rivals them all.  If you work downtown I highly recommend checking them out Fridays in the summer in Mellon Square. You will be in for a treat compared to the regular selection downtown."}
{"text":"I love their gyros, gyro salads, and chicken salads.  I have been eating here since they were in Sewickley, PA they no longer have a sit down area so you have to order your food to go, but the food is still the same it's \"delicious\".  If you love Greek food they have it and if you have a picky kid(s) like me they have chicken fingers and various food items for them as well.  A lot of their dressings are from scratch including their Greek and Ranch Dressing.  They give you large portions one gyro salad is enough for two people.  I still believe they have the $3 gyros on Mondays which is a steal."}
{"text":"The hummus! Oh, the hummus!!!

It's no secret that you can find good pierogies in Ambridge - you're never more than a block or two from a Ukrainian church that'll serve them up year-round.

But what about awesome Greek food? Can you get THAT in Ambridge?

Yes. Yes, oh yes, oh YES you can!

Little Athen's is located on the corner of 5th St and Merchant, in a little storefront that looks like a pizza shop. But for a little shop, they boast a large menu of Greek delights (and hot dogs and french fries and the like if you've got an 'iffy about Greek food' person in your party).

No matter what else you get, snag a tub of the hummus. It is garlicky, lightly lemony, so smooth in texture, and it's wonderful with the soft, warm pita bread they serve alongside. The tabbouleh is quite good as well, and the spanikopita... DANG GIRL. It's good stuff. Cheese for days!

Prices are reasonable - most menu items are between 4 and 6 dollars. And the portions are large; you can easily split a single order of the spanikopita with a friend.

So if you find yourself in Ambridge or passing through, and you're craving the best hummus of your life, stop here and pick up a to-go order. But good luck limiting yourself to just the hummus - once you take a peek at the menu, you'll be having trouble narrowing your choices down!"}
{"text":"I got to experience Little Athens while they were in Mellon Square on Friday during lunch. They had a ton of options to choose from: moussaka, stuffed grapes leaves, stuffed pork chops, stuffed peppers, Lady locks, lemon cake, baklava ect. All food entrees were $8 or under. Desserts were even cheaper.

I went with the moussaka which has potatoes, beef, egg plants then a white sauce on top. They also had a vegetarian version of it without the beef. It was $7 and the portion was huge. The staff was extremely friendly and the moussaka was fabulous. I was tempted to get a lady lock but decided against it.

Little Athens Catering will be in Pittsburgh all summer! Thursdays in Market Square for the farmers market and Fridays at Mellon Square. I don't know if its an all day thing, but I know that they are there for lunch hours. Im unsure if they take cards at farmers market. I ran to ATM to get cash because I assumed they didn't. Hey, who knows"}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing spanakopita, by far the best I've ever had. The portions are generous and the prices aren't bad at all. I'm so glad i found this little gem in the town of Ambridge. My gyro wouldn't even fold in half! I got the chicken and lamb gyro and i could not even pick it up! Haha, i really enjoyed my food & the customer service was satisfactory."}
{"text":"Omgoodness such a great family and wonderful take out and catering. Certainly recommend the grilled chicken, homemade hummus, Greek Lemon Chicken soup. Can't go wrong with any of their menu items."}
{"text":"The Gyros are great. For $7 you really get a full meal. Trying the Stuffed Cabbage tonight so will update. Also the stuffed grape leaves are great. There is another place in Ambridge that also sells Gyros but skip that place and go here. Girl behind the counter that cooks is also really nice."}
