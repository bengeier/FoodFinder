{"text":"This place has been in the same location since 1988. They really do have great pizza (and they also have hamburgers, lasagna, and more, but I've only ever had the pizza). The crust is nice and crisp (without being too tough), and the toppings are just right. The staff are pleasant and friendly and always make me feel welcome. My only wish is there were more (vegetable) topping options."}
{"text":"I was very impressed by the quality considering our family always orders gourmet. The price was also very affordable when you are feeding a extra large family. The only downfall, no delivery available."}
{"text":"It is really good pizza,good location,GREAT STAFF... Good prices with a homemade taste.... See I like that I am so over the same old pizza,this place has a unique flavour worth a try for the price.... 2 large with 6 toppers (3each) for 20$ so only note to be aware of is that it's a very thin pizza and thin crust... But don't fret you can ask for thick or med crust so if that's your thing just ask.... Not a fan of the thin crust but it actually very nice and crispy.... One big downfall is they have one dip lol need some more options. As said overall it was nice and great staff clean environment (THATS KEY) LETS KEEP THESE MA AND PA style shops going.... Hope my first blog on yelp helped!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza In Town? Probably not.... sorry.. however oddly enough what this place does succeed in, is having a real nice, affordable. Burger and Fries!! Of all things at a place called Best Pizza In Town to have a even better burger, is kind of funny to be honest. So try the burger here, its definately worth it!"}
