{"text":"I am not sure why their rating is kind of low but when I ate there with my husband, the food was amazing and so good. We got the nourishing bone soup and the hot chili soup as our base for $8.99, and $26.99 for each person in all you can eat hot pot. On week days, it's $24.99. Their selections was wide ranged and they have almost everything you can think of to put in your hot pot. Plus you have other sauces and condiments in the front of the restaurant to add in to your liking to match your taste. The only draw back I had was a very long line ahead of us but they have an iPad to check in at the front and they will call you when they have your table ready."}
{"text":"80 bucks for two people (Sunday, plus tips). 
Did not get some items even though we ordered twice.  There are other restaurants serving a better Hotpot than this one."}
{"text":"Me and my friends ordered dried hot pot and dumplings. I was surprised that this place does not serve mapo tofu during the dinner time.
The server helped us with ordering food. There were not enough English instructions to be able to order. The food was overall good, except that there were many bones and dried chilli that needed to be put aside, so we had to order extra bowls just to dispose of them. The food had the numbing & spicy feel, and it was something I wasn't familiar with, let alone my friends.  Considering the cost, I didn't find the food to be terribly filling.
The overall interior didn't leave much room for bags or coats, but the servers were friendly in general. I may come back just to try the mapo tofu during the lunch time, but I wouldn't bring my unsuspecting friends who can't handle spicy food."}
{"text":"food is just pure dog shit makes me wanna vomit, their chicken are stinky and some spicy dishes are ridiculously sweet that you can even taste the sugar in your mouth this is not Chinese food or not even food for human beings so if you wanna waste 30 dollars on some dog shit and flirt some Chinese international student then come to sichuanren"}
{"text":"A bit of an adventure. I thought Sichuan was a variation on the szechuan I'm used to having in Chinatown.  Turns out I needed some schooling about the wonders of hot pot and cold pot dishes. Thanks to a very patient waitress, we were walked through choosing our soup base and adding in tons of yummy veggie, meat, seafood and tofu options. Lots of side dishes too. 

Around $20 for all you can eat. And a seniors discount. What? Too good to be true!

My lunch date has returned since with others who were also WOWed. They were also impressed by the pristine state of the restaurant. It's even more impressive when you consider people are cooking on the tables.

I'll return. With a big appetite. Especially if they get the liquor license sorted out."}
{"text":"Everytime my bf and I walk pass here it always looks so empty so we were always hesitant to come here. But last weekend, we walked by and it had quite a good amount of people so we thought why not have lunch there.

After looking at the menu, I decided on the tomato based ribs noodle soup. And my bf ordered the beef noodle soup which he was told will be really spicy.

We waited quite a while, our server looked like she hated her job. Anyways, after 35 mins of trying to catch Pokemon, our food arrived! 

I actually really enjoyed my noodle soup, it was really flavourful and I liked the type of noodles they used. My bf's noodle soup however wasn't even that spicy, it's actually very bearable. So I don't know what the server was talking about when she warned him that it will be very spicy which Sichuan food is known for. 

Overall, it's an alright place to get noodles but this wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"I was craving hot pot after a shopping trip at Yorkdale with a friend and Sichuan Ren was the closest one to us. I read the reviews prior to going, and although they weren't great, I thought I'd give the place a shot anyway. 

It was around $27 per person and broth was an additional charge ($3.99 or more depending on the soup base). The menu options were average, not that extensive but good enough. I have been to hot pot restaurants with more options for a dollar or two cheaper. 

The place is much smaller than I imagined, but was modern and clean. 

SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE. At first it seemed like the reviews would be wrong about their service since they greeted us when we walked in and talked us through the process. About 2-3 items from our first order didn't come out. We asked for another order sheet to order the missing items and a couple of other items. A bowl of dumplings came out to which I told the waiter that we didn't order that dish and he gave me attitude - it was the table beside us who had ordered it. Our items still did not come out, so I told another waitress our issue. She then went to check on it, but apparently the order sheet \"got lost.\" So we ordered again for a third time, and only half of the things came out... 

Overall, Sichuan Ren was okay. I probably won't come here again unless I'm nearby and REALLY craving hot pot."}
{"text":"Horrible!! I ordered the ma pao tofu rice and braised pork noodles soup. Both were covered in a very thick layer of oil and they both taste horrible.  I couldnt even feel my mouth after a few bite.  Will never come back!"}
{"text":"Definitely on par with Morals Hot Pot (except for the quality of the meat - Morals has better meats). I come to Sichuan Ren for their flavourful soup bases, my favourites are the tomato and the spicy soup base with beef oil. 

My favourite orders are: beef tendon (it just melts in your mouth), hand sliced lamb (amazing chew and more flavour), oyster mushrooms and enoki mushrooms. 

They have some side dishes which is a nice touch, especially if you get tired of the same constant flavour of hotpot. They also serve a refreshing aiyu based dessert (I believe it aiyu at least). Service is quick and efficient."}
{"text":"This place has got to be the worst and disgusting hot pot places in Ontario. First off, the sauce station is so poorly maintained and unhygienic- there are fruit flies just chilling in the pool of sauces. Pots and plates are not clean. Waters not clean. It's just unhygienic af. Also, too expensive for the shit quality. Just don't go. Go somewhere in Markham."}
{"text":"I ordered Pork and rice from the menu, it was a take away and when I got home to eat my meal found a disgusting pile of pure fat! No meat whatsoever to be found. This is misleading from their menu. I called the restaurant and I was told its indeed pork belly but its not specified in the menu.
Totally a waste of money since I bought two meals. I also told them no egg and they added a fried egg to both of my meals. There is also a huge communication barrier."}
{"text":"I rarely have the urge to write reviews but this restaurant was absolutely atrocious.

1. On a Sunday night, when the restaurant is full, they only have ONE waitress serving everybody. When new customers walked in, they are asked to sit at tables that haven't even been cleaned yet. The poor lady had to do everything from cleaning, serving, taking reservations to handling bills. The owner must be a cheap@ss

2. The food: where do I start...half the items I ordered didn't arrive. Absolutely ridiculous for an AYCE restaurant. The beef was...tasteless and gave me a stomachache

3. Price: $26.99 per person on a weekend and THE BROTH IS EXTRA ($4-$9). Really? A hotpot restaurant where the price of the broth is not included. Lmao.

4. Atmosphere: loud Chinese drama playing in the background. All I heard was some Asian girl whining on TV. 

Bottom line: if you like long wait times, mediocre food, have too much money, love hanging out with Chinese international students, then this is the place for you"}
{"text":"I was craving spicy food and decided to try this new place. 
I ordered dry hot pot ($7.99) with 2 vegetarian (+3.99 each) and 1 protein (+4.99) options. The portion was actually quite big and would probably last me 2-3 meals. I really liked the flavor since the spiciness was quite authentic. I wish they have a lunch version of the dish so I don't have to bring take outs from lunch."}
{"text":"1.5 stars! I really wanted to give this place a chance as I really like braised beef noodle soup and since Asian Legend recently closed in the area, I have a limited number of choices for beef noodle soup.

I called at around 5pm and a woman answered with \"Hello?\" so I requested to make a pick-up order. The girl on the other line immediately stated \"This is not the Thai restaurant.\" I stated, \"Yes, I know. It's Sichuan Ren.\" She then went on to say \"We don't do delivery.\" I told her that it was okay because I planned to pick it up. I proceeded with my order of two braised beef noodle soups, setting aside the odd telephone manner. Two minutes later, I get a call back and the girl tells me that they are \"out of beef noodle soup.\" Whaaa? Anyway, they told me that I'd have to wait 30 minutes for my order. I gave them a chance and agreed to it.

Thirty minutes later, I went to the restaurant to pick up my order. Apparently, for takeout orders, they put the noodles and the soup in the same container! For those who live a bit farther away, beware as your noodles may end up soaking up all the soup by the time you get home! Luckily, I didn't have a far drive (2 minutes). The restaurant ambiance itself was the exact same as the Thai restaurant that used to be there--modern, small space, fairly clean.

Oh by the way, if you're not into spicy, ask for no spice because they mentioned that even their \"no spice\" orders are quite spicy. The woman worried me a bit so I ordered \"no spice\" but it didn't turn out to be spicy at all.

So their beef noodle soup was nowhere as good as other places I've tried. The soup was decent and had some flavour, but there was a giant piece of ginger in the broth, which wasn't fun to bite into.  The worst part was the beef--it was so chewy! They also give only 3 pieces, so you're mostly eating noodles and soup for $11.99.

Anyway, all in all, not a satisfying meal and I probably won't be going back for another meal anytime soon."}
{"text":"Do you like things spicy?  Sichuan Ren might be the place for you!

Pros:
Spicy lovers haven

Cons:
Not much selection for non spicy eaters

This placed opened up on last Friday and we decided to give it a try for dinner since it's so close.  I'm a lover of spicy foods so I was definitely a little excited.  This place used to be a Thai restaurant and if you've been before, you will know that they left the decor exactly the same.  The only things changed is the sign outside and the menus inside.  Seating is OK for the most part.  It's a little tight in the corner near the front and if you come with a party lager than 4, it could be a little troublesome.

We ordered the spicy cucumber side dish and two noodle soups.  We had ordered another side dish but they told us they ran out of it.  Running out of something on the first day of business is not unheard of, but it did suck a little bit.  The side dish was pretty spicy and a taste of things to come.  The portion size was good with a lot of cucumbers.

Our noodles were decent.  They give you a lot of noodle but not too much of the meat.  We had a braised pork and beef noodles and there were about 6-7 pieces of each.  It would of been nice to have better portions of that.  The soup is spicy and you could smell the aroma of the Sichuan peppercorns the region is known for. However, they load it with too much chili oil.  It made the broth far to oily to drink.  The meats were pretty tender for the most part so that was nice.  It's a decent bowl of noodles, but it could of been a lot better.

During out stay, we saw at least 2 groups come in who obviously didn't know that SIchuan cuisine is predominately spicy.  They took one look at the menu and realized this place wasn't for them.  They have about 2-3 non spicy items and that's it.  If you don't like spicy foods, this will not be the place for you.  The staff were very friendly and totally understanding when it happened.  They were very good for our visit. 

If you love spicy food, this will be a place you should check out.  They have a lot of traditional Sichuan dishes to try but don't bring anyone who's not into spicy food."}
{"text":"We went to Sishuan Ren restaurant for dinner. We didn't really realized that they only serve hot pot and nothing else. We stayed anything even though I am not a fan of hot pot.

The menu were difficult to understand and we have to call the waitress over to order the food. The food was good, but the service was pretty bad. The waitress did not refilled our glasses and never came over to check on us.

Would we go back? I don't it since they are many good restaurants in that area."}
{"text":"I love hot pot, I love spicy food, I love do-it-yourself style food, I love having varieties, it was my birthday night, so I decided to come here and try since I noticed it's recently opened.

A cold Wednesday night, it was quite empty (only 2 tables when we came in and 2-3 tables when we left)

Service: friendly service with a young waitress who speak fluent English (a plus for a Chinese place in Chinatown). It's all-you-can-eat: you tell the staff what you want, and they order the food for you on an iPad, pretty common in a lot of all-you-can-eat places, and everything we ordered came.

Note: the portion size per order depends on the number of people - less people = small portions, more people = bigger portions

Food: We ordered a double soup base with hot chili (medium spicy) and mushroom - the flavour was very light for both, and the hot chili soup base didn't really have a Sichuan style taste to it, not too impressed because that's the most important part of hot pot, where the food gets boiled and absorb the flavour. The rest of the food was pretty fresh, nothing distinctive to mention.

Overall: for about the same price, I think I'd rather go to Morals Village hot pot which is just 1min walk distance from here for better flavour and wider selection of food (and all-you-can-eat soft serve!)

Note:Debit OR CASH ONLY, 5% off if paid CASH"}
{"text":"Another hot pot place has arrived on Dundas just in time for winter! This is Sichuan's second location, its first being in North York. I'd say it's very comparable to the other hot pot places close by and I'd return again.

Service:
We got all the items we requested and the staff were quick to deliver the items. Requests are made directly to the waiter so you aren't limited to any \"rounds\" per se like other restaurants. They weren't stingy on the meat, so we got adequate amounts for the 6 of us. We had to ask twice for the dan dan noodles but they came eventually. Staff also had a good attitude which was a plus.

Food:
There is a decent variety of soup bases from standard pork bone, to tomato, to spicy ranging from $3.99 to $7.99 which was pretty pricy for just a soup base. They offer half moon pots so you can try 2 different soup bases. There is a decent variety of meat, veggies, fish balls and noodles to choose from. They also have some dishes such as dan dan noodles, cold noodles, and dumplings for order as well. Overall, food selection was on par with other hot pot restaurants in Chinatown.

Seating:
Standard table seating, either single tables for pairs of 2, or larger tables for 6 which have 2 hot pot plates. They have portable racks for your food so it doesn't take up too much dining space which was nice.

Prices:
Cash or debit only. 5% discount if you pay cash. Prices are about the same as all the other hot pot restaurants. All in including base fee + soup base, taxes and tip, it came to ~$42"}
{"text":"Extremely oily. The oiliest I have ever had. We had stirred fried veggie and meat. Portion was small. Food was overpriced. Waiter told us it costs on average about 30 each. Seasoning was so strong. Couldn't possibly taste whether the food was fresh or not. Don't recommend."}
{"text":"Terrible food, terrible service. It took them 30 mins to get them serve a simple dish. And I was the only customer at the time. All they did was watch TV - the waitress, cook, and even the delivery men. They were having fun in Chinese and did not care about my order. When my order did come, the food was just horrible. The wontons had the worst texture and it was just salty. The broth did not make any sense, as it was just oil. It only tasted salty as hell and I'm not sure if it was saltyer then pure salt water. And it cost me 20$ for that crap menu. Never go there."}
