{"text":"WOW, I was impressed by the service, the food and the unique d√©cor.  This place was chosen by a buddy of mine mostly because of the location being closer to another friend we were meeting for lunch.  He plugged in the location and picked this restaurant off of its 5-star review.  The menu does have just the right amount of choices with several flavors of gourmet quesadillas on the \"Dilla\" menu and some interesting choices on the \"Tacos\" menu.  The guys and I went straight for our favorites.  I had the \"Carne Asada\" dilla and my buddies had the \"All Thai'd Up\" dilla, which they agreed the heat matched the name.  There was a unique fashion statement here with all the bright colors to give the feeling of dining on the sun.  I am always a bit picky about seating and comfort.  So, although the place was dressed well, I didn't like the painted slated metal foldout chairs around very small round short tables.  Although, I was amazed by the size and thickness of the quesadillas that felt like plenty for one person.  I spent just 13 bucks on the meal and a drink (fruity style in a mason jar) with the perfect speed for lunch.  Complimentary chips and salsa at the table with great customer service and just a delicious all around meal, left me feeling like I wanted more.  I will definitely put this place on my go to lunch stop the next time I make it this far for lunch."}
{"text":"Tacos are Divine! Dillas are flavors from the Gods. Tried the All Thai'd Up - spicy, sweet, stuff full of perfectly cooked chicken, every flavor played happy together. Went there last night around 6:30, we basically had the place to ourselves. Staff was friendly, helpful and so gracious. We tried the Dessert and Snack shop to finish our meal with the carrot cake, yum. People came in and out for to go orders, I am going to bring everyone I know here. You should too!"}
{"text":"Great seasoned meat, full of flavor. The salsa is amazing with thick crunchy, salty chips that taste homemade.The most nicest people. Great service, and actually cares for the customers. Adorable Mexican wrestling theme. The tres leche is to die for, and so are the tacos! It's amazing that they went from a taco truck to an amazing (not huge) restaurant. I recommend this to anybody that wants an amazing family friendly, (Mexican food) restaurant."}
{"text":"Look, guys... My cousin had a wedding in her backyard tonight. You might be saying, \"What does that have to do with these guys?\"

It has everything to do with this. The wedding was catered by their food truck, with a custom menu designed by the bride and groom, and holy crap. HOLY CRAP. For the first time in 16 years, I had a real taco. Their carne asada tacos (soft corn tortillas, delectable chopped steak, onion, fresh cilantro, and a twist of lime) will blow your friggin' mind. Then, my cousin chose a quesadilla, \"All Thai'ed Up\", with chicken, grilled onions, serrano peppers, jack cheese, and sweet Thai sauce. 

Oh. My. God. 

Dude.

DUDE.

Once I get back my life, I'll tell you how amazing they were. I have to go find it. I think it's in another quesadilla. I'm in line for it. Can I get it with a side of pico de gallo?

Please, go to wherever these intrepid food magicians have their main gig and support them. These gringos can make some wicked food, yo."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had in years! 

All the food was amazing. We had lengua tacos, carne fries and three quesadillas - the mac daddy, all Thai'd up, and steak blue. We also had chips and queso  and some aqua frescas. Everything was outstanding. 

Great food, great environment. It is a must try. 

A note on the lengua tacos - these are one of my all time favorite type of tacos so I have had a lot of them. Let me say the Taco and Dilla Parlors are by far THE BEAST HANDS DOWN that I have ever had."}
{"text":"Tacos were OK, although salty. Service was great and the place was very clean. Had 'arrachera' tacos but the meat was dry and not juicy at all. Tried their 'habanero' sauce and it was great!

Maybe their tacos are better at their food truck."}
{"text":"Theor Street tacos ar? awesome. Love to whole simplicity of the place.  Don't bring your hot date on her birthday to eat there but bring your best friend any weekend day. This is the kind of place"}
{"text":"This place is legit. Good salsa, hearty tacos, and some seriously delicious 'dillas'. They have vegetarian options as well as the coveted carne asada fries. Get a churro to top it off. Filled with some sort of sweet goodness, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This is the best quesedilla I have ever had. The juices are to die for and they always have friendly service and great product knowledge. I definitely recommend and have no hesitation naming this the best food truck and store front for fast Mexican food in az"}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time, had The All Thai'd Up. The chicken was juicy and tender with a ton of flavor and a nice spice kick. Tasty salsa too. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Good tacos, cabeza was great. Decor was great but they need more salsa options."}
{"text":"Been eating from this place for some time! Never disappointed! Whether it's the truck or the actual location! So good! Great staff and owners!"}
{"text":"Try this place! Creative and extremely delicious. Just had the Thai Dilla. Wow. Love the American/Thai/Mexican fusion. The flavors add up to something unique that really works; served in the best homemade tortillas I've had north of the border."}
{"text":"This was a great place to be social with the staff and have a great meal for a very reasonable price. I would definitely recommend this location as a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Amazing food truck! Love the All Thai'd Up quesadilla! Definitely the best I've had anywhere!"}
{"text":"I first had luncha libre from the food truck. Food is delicious and stays true to the food I tried at the truck. Small menu, but everything I've tried so far is good. Steak and bleu is my go to quesadilla. They have tacos here too."}
{"text":"First time here: we ordered  the cheese fries with pico and carne asada on it - the fries are awesome and I wish there were more - it had quite a bit of cheese on it and I would probably ask for 1/2 cheese next time - the beef was outstanding! We also had carne and chicken tacos which were very good - a bit on the salty side but very good. The steak & bleu quesadilla was a hit - massive and tons of meat and cheese! The chips and salsa that came with it were excellent and the salsa was excellent! Oh I had the unsweetened jasmine tea which came in a huge glass mason jar with a lid! Great place and definitely going back."}
{"text":"Great food. Chill atmosphere. Don't forget to order the Tiger's Blood. 
Lengua tacos were tender and loaded with fresh avocados. Carne Asada dilla was stuffed with meat and melting cheese. So good!"}
{"text":"You want to stop here to try their tacos for a while finally have the chance I ordered to lingua and two asada the lingua was not good taste like they didn't clean it very good I don't really chewy not soft and tender like it should be it had a weird aftertaste now the asada was was just ok it tasted old or could have been just over cooked may give another try not too sure though"}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall restaurant.  Daily specials, tacos and quesadillas. Very good food and good service.  Try it"}
{"text":"OMG, I ordered the Papa Verdi quesadilla and my SO ordered the All thai'd up quesadilla. the presentation looked as if they were just prepared for a food channel show, overstuffed and oozing with cheese. The papa Verdi was delicious but I found my wife's all thai'd up was to spicy for my taste. The chips that were served with the quesadillas came out warm and freshly made. The quesadillas were so overstuffed the we could only eat half  and took our leftovers for lunch the following day. Be aware that the dining room is very ecliptic and small with just a few tables."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix for a conference and saw great reviews of this place on Pinterest: Luncha Libre did not disappoint! We had the Chicken-Dilla, it was delicious! All the ingredients were fresh. The chips and salsa tasted amazing, just the right amount of spicy. The drinks are very refreshing, they're served in huge mason jars you can take with you. Prices are right on point. Staff is super friendly and helpful. The place is nicely decorated with merchandise of Mexican Luchadores, very unique.Will definitely be coming back to Luncha Libre everytime we come back to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Recently moved into the area and while using a business nearby we decided to pop in and check out their menu to see if it looked good enough to come back. When we explained that we didn't want to order because we had just eaten they gave us a couple free coupons to come back for tacos. While we were there they told us about their food and history which is always nice to know about local establishment. The food ended up being delicious and again the customer service was outstanding. 
Glad to have a new 'neighborhood' spot to go to on a regular basis.e"}
{"text":"Great ambiance 
Staff is very friendly
Only Mexican Resturant that served properly cooked goat.  Best goat taco I ever ate...they did a great job on the goat taco...meat is very tender and marinated to right level..
Salsa and chips they served is very different from other Mexican restaurants..."}
{"text":"Weird to see a food truck turn its concept into a brick and mortar store but given its location to me, there are no complaints!

Went in the other day for the first time (my girlfriend has had their food from the truck before but neither of us have had food from the store) after seeing the carne asada fries on their instagram.  We split an order of those as well as a carne quesadilla, and had a coupon for a free luncharita (which do not have alcohol in them, which mildly surprised me).  

The guy behind the counter couldn't have been nicer! He gave us samples of the flavors for our luncharita and when we went to add on some chips to our order after having paid, he told us not to worry about it.

The Carne fries were, just, amazing.  The only thing I would mention is that the liquid cheese was a little overpowering/overdone but the fries were perfect, carne was tasty, and they also put some siracha on top. A full to go box full for $10, reminded me a lot of carne asada fries from Tacos El Gordo in Las Vegas in terms of portion size.  Two grown adults weren't able to take this down in one sitting (but it was just as tasty the next day reheated!)

The quesadilla was just as tasty with gobs of cheese, though a little smaller than I would have thought given the price, it also comes with chips.

They have a good selections of salsa and the mason jar you get with the Luncharita is yours to keep and bring back for $3 refills.

Overall our meal for the two of us, was $19 (take in to account we had a coupon for the drink and were given a free order of chips which are normally two bucks) which is pretty darn good for the quality you're getting.

I'm sure we will be back!"}
{"text":"So....It could be inappropriate..I was told not do do it, after all in some circles its a taboo.  I was much younger when I first held hands, I was much younger when I had my first kiss.  Mom said \"make sure this is what you really want\"..but I just had too.

After 41 years on this earth I finally got some tongue!  Yep...had a beef tongue, and it was one of the best tacos ever!  If you ever need good eats...this is it!!"}
{"text":"I am so happy they opened a permanent location!  No more waiting until Fridays if I don't want to. Their All Thai'd Up is my favorite quesadilla in the world. The mix of cilantro salsa and chili sweet Thai sauce is amazing. I usually don't like onions in any food but they add so much flavor to the chicken and cheese. Their luncharitas are also something to look forward to. So refreshing and icy cold."}
{"text":"Adorable decor. 

Aaaaaaand the good news ends there. 

Elote is made from canned corn. The chili and lime are yummy but don't hide the obviously soggy wimpy kernels. Corn is so cheap and easy to make why would they do this?

Bean and cheese burrito is MASSIVE. But that's not a good thing. It had no flavor. Again....how?...why?

Speaking of no flavor. Salsa is so watery and flavorless. The worst part is they charge .50 cents per container. I wouldn't mind that much if it actually added a little sumtin sumtin to the food. 

There are no vegetarian options (UGH) besides the B and C burrito but I asked the guy working if he could throw together a veggie taco with ingredients they had (potatoes chiles onion avocado). My boyfriend said they were good although I don't know if he was just being nice since I was the one that picked up dinner. 

Chips are solid. But what's the point if your salsa tastes like water?

Sad. I was hoping this would be a shopping plaza gem but you sadly couldn't convince me to come back."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is 1.2 miles from my house & I'm upset I didn't discover it sooner. I was told their \"All thai'd up\" quesadilla was the most popular so i got it. I can't describe the pleasure my mouth felt when i took the first bite! It was amazing and i will be here often from now on :) Go try it!! It's a cute little place with luchadores & day of the dead skulls art. I love everything about it."}
{"text":"Great place.  Don't judge it by being in a strip mall, this place is great.  Had the Carnitas tacos and the Chicken tacos and both were fantastic!  Can't wait to go back and try many other items in the menu.  Especially the drink menu.  Not a lot of seating so be smart what time you come and have low expectations in seating.  Which again is a testament to the great food!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food! My husband had the black and bleu, I had the tai'd up and my 14 month old had the lil' dilla (kid quesadilla). All were tasty and gooey with cheese. My toddler usually doesn't like tortillas but he ate this up! We had take out, but we'll try eating there next time."}
{"text":"Found this place via Yelp. So many great options. Ordered the steak Dilla and two chicken tacos for my son. Delicious! I have never had a Dilla prepared this way. I am so glad I found this place. Thanks Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Bomb az lil tacos.  I've tried carne asada, pollo, and carnitas.  All three were off the hook.  Hard to choose a favorite.  They are filled pretty well with meat and topped with whole cilantro leafs and diced white onion.  For me the best part about them are the double wrapped homemade corn tortillas.  Slightly fried and salted.  Bomb dot com.  

The chips and salsas are also on point.  The habanero is straight fire.  Tread cautiously.  

The downside is the cost.  $10.50 for three lil tacos and some chips and salsa is crazy talk.  As both a taco connoisseur and artist not only do I know how to make them but I know how much it costs to do so.

Luncha Libre is very popular and it is easy to see why.  The tacos coming out of here are absolutely delicious.  I can see the price being the only thing keeping me from being a steady customer and giving these lil flavor bombs 5 stars."}
{"text":"I've ordered the carnita tacos, the carne dilla, and the bean burrito and this place never disappoints. The tacos are moist and flavorfull, the dillas are filled to the brim, and the bean burrito was bigger than a chipotle burrito! The chips are amazing and the salsa and guacamole have the perfect amount of spice."}
{"text":"The food and service were amazing! I love supporting local places. I ordered a carne asada taco and chicken taco. They were so overstuffed with meat and so tasty!"}
{"text":"I am traveling from the east coast and growing up in LA, I really miss authentic Mexican food when I am there! The closest I can get to Mexican food on the east coast is chipotle.

I asked the person working there for recommendations and he suggested the all thai'd up quesadilla but I was craving tacos so I ordered the lengua (beef tongue), carnitas (shredded pork), and carne arrachera (skirt steak). My favorite was the skirt steak! I liked my tacos with chunks of meat. It was very flavorful! I also like the beef tongue :P That is one of my favorite cut of meat! But because this is stewed, it loses some of the texture that I like in the beef tongue. But the avocado slice in the taco was a nice touch. 3 tacos came out to be $9.50 and comes with side of chips and salsa. 

I love the art inside this restaurant and I am happy to say my Mexican craving was satisfied!"}
{"text":"I'm sitting here in Seattle, WA, listening to my friends tell us about this place. They were skeptical at first then told us it's the best tacos HE HAS EVER HAD!!!! Singing your praises! Bravo!"}
{"text":"Consistently amazing!  I've hooked many of my friends on this place.  Check out their truck too!  It's all around the valley."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and go here for lunch. My friend had the torta and it looked amazing (she said it was delicious). I had the carne tacos and the meat was flavorful and plentiful. The salsa - delicious. The corn tortillas were perfect and the perfect vessel for the meat. I'm gonna get them again 

I had the strawberry guava luncharita and it was refreshing. It wasn't too sweet and perfect for a hot day. I got a refill. The staff was super nice. The establishment is wonderfully decorated, but small. So I wouldn't go during the rush unless you're getting it to go. It takes a while to get your food because it's made fresh to order and completely worth the wait. 

I looked around at other peoples' plates and everything looked wonderful. The dillas looked perfect. Next time I go, I'm getting one. Lastly, we ended our meal with churros...geezeeee creezeee. They came out hot. Bravo guys, bravo. 

Ya gotta go. For the love of all that is good in this world, go!"}
{"text":"Great tacos ($1.50 mini hard shells on Tuesdays). Service was fabulous, though it is built for takeout. Only a couple of high tops."}
{"text":"Went again today and the carnitas fries is amazing! The meat was perfectly cooked, the fries were crisp on the outside and mealy on the inside. There's a great amount of cheese. It came with sour cream and guacamole. Oh and then topped with sriracha. Great lunch and I'll be going back again."}
{"text":"Best bean and cheese burrito in town!! Our kids beg us to take them there weekly. My sister used taco dilla's catering for a graduation/birthday party for her kids and they did a faboulos job. The set up was top notch and the food was always well stocked . Their customer service was on point . All of the food was amazing stand outs- steak and blue cheese quesadillas! Yum yum"}
{"text":"great ambiance and friendly dude behind the counter. on our first trip he had no hesitation in giving the low-down on their menu items and which way we should go."}
{"text":"At first glance, Taco & Dilla Parlor seems a little out of place. It's in a not so nice looking little store front outlet off the side of a busy Phoenix street. The places next door are a little run down looking. But when you enter T&D Parlor it's really nice inside! There's a strong Mexican Catholic decor vibe which is fun in an over the top way. It's pretty hipster.
But we all know the real reason you come here... The quesadillas! And man are they worth it. They have a bunch of unique quesadilla concoctions and they all sound equally delicious. I got the Thai quesadilla and the spicy sweet combination was unlike any quesadilla you've had.
Worth the trip just to try their dillas."}
{"text":"This place is great. Been a few times always great food. Tacos are really good, Mac quesadilla best thing ever made, Thai chicken dilla incredible too. Churro and art/atmosphere complete the perfect place. 5*"}
{"text":"The All Thai Dilla is amazing. I understand why it won an award. We are from out of town and we're lucky enough to stumble across this place."}
{"text":"Landed at PHX and went to Taco and Dilla before checking into our hotel. It was a great choice. Our family (5 and 7 year old girls) shared a cheese quesadilla, blue cheese quesadilla (omg delicious), chips and salsa and the Thai quesadilla. All amazing. Topped off with friendly and helpful service. It was an awesome trip! The server even gave us some churros to try. Obviously they were amazing to."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch on Saturday and had a great experience.  The couple that owns the place is very friendly, the food was fantastic and I LOVE the \"luncharitas\" (fresh juice) served in a jar.  The citrus berry was absolutely delicious...I am seriously going to crave this stuff every day!  The chicken dilla was quite tasty - the salsa was legit too!"}
{"text":"Surprised at the number of five star reviews until I ate here. This is a hidden gem. Worth driving from downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Would highly recommend this place. The quesadillas are so good and the service is great. No public restrooms do make sure you wash your hands before getting here. You'll love the food. 

Check out their Instagram for food pics"}
{"text":"This place is a must-have. Great for lunch. Honestly great anytime they are open. Everyone that works here is extremely helpful. The food is top notch. I'm in town for work but have easily been here 5-6 times in 2 and a half weeks. It's just that good."}
{"text":"Love this little place    The  quesadillas are off the chain. The Steak&Blue is my Fav"}
{"text":"Taco & Dilla Parlor to me felt was a little over hyped. The food was a little bit of a disappointment for me. For what it was in my opinion it wasn't really worth it because the amount of food in comparison to competitors for lunch and the flavor fell short. I thought that their Quesadillas (Dilla) took a very interesting take on it though. They serve these in a form of a sandwich almost and in a basket. In the dillas though, they stacked it with potatoes, which to me was an interesting take. But, the thing about it is that it lacked flavor and that to get any kind of taste you sort of needed to dip it in some sort of sauce. I'm not big on dipping quesadillas in sauce it sort of takes away from a good flavorful experience. 

My coworkers ordered some tacos, however at the price point, I definitely would recommend to skip this and just get a Dilla. The amount that you get isn't worth the price and that you could most definitely find a better alternative around the block or travel a few more miles down the road. 

All in all, there wasn't anything exciting about this place. As I said, overhyped as one of the best places ever. I feel that my experience in Phoenix, there were a lot of better options for lunch out there, but if you're tied on time this place is a quick take out spot."}
{"text":"This place is 5min away from my house..so I go here offen.. the bean burrito is my favorite.. \"At the time\" Just 3$ for a delicious pinto bean jack cheese and their homemade red sauce.. Big enough to share.. which I didn't.They renew the restaurant made it bigger.. Looks Amazing..BUT.. haven't been in a week or so since they made the new changes I order my burrito.. Wich is now 6$ And with  black beans.. they put too much red sauce/back beans and not enough cheese.. Hey I don't mind black beans but the pinto beans was way better..."}
{"text":"Neat hole in the wall-type place with awesome artwork! I enjoy quesadillas quite a bit and was excited to see a restaurant dedicated to unique quesadillas, had to come give it a try. 
I immediately knew I wanted to try the papa verde quesadilla. My boyfriend was debating between a few but decided on one that had steak, I can't remember the name! He also got a lengua taco, and a Mexican coke (thanks to yelp!). The guy working at the register/serving us was super nice. Made conversation with us and gave us great service.
The chips and salsa were so good! We loved the smokey salsa and asked for more after we finished all of ours haha. The quesadillas were massive! My boyfriend didn't even finish his, brought half home. My only complaint was that the potatoes on the quesadilla were way too salty. Also I wish they were cut a little thicker. I ended up scraping a bunch of potatoes off of my quesadilla because of how salty they were. I got guac on the side though and that was tasty! When we were finished we decided to try churros and they were filled with something delicious and $2 each. Amazing. I'd come back for churros! Overall good experience!"}
{"text":"My favorite thing to so when I am upset is to stop by here and get a caramel filled churro !!! Its only $2 and its so delicious . I yelped for desserts near me and have been hooked ever since.  So glad I found this spot.  The guy at the counter was solo nice and the interior design is amazing art."}
{"text":"Hooray!

Luncha Libre have gone brick and mortar....and they're in my hood! They were my first official post-Scotland hangover meal this morning after I was re-christented at the Swizz and Bar One last night.

You'll find the same menu as their food truck, so I can now have my Steak and Bleu Dilla, with a side of chips and salsa, whenever I want!!! They also serve street tacos and luncharitas, and fresh churros for postre. They also have a small cooler with Mexican coke AND Fanta!!!! Yup, FANTA!!!! Orange AND grape flavor!!!!!!

They're starting smart with a tiny but cheerful spot with two tables, some counter space and a few sidewalk tables. Very cheerful place, with the same great yummy menu we've all come to love. Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"We have had extensive experience with Taco & Dilla Parlor and have never been disappointed. The service is second to none and the food is amazing. They have so many unique offerings that you could eat here daily and never get tired. Definitely a must for great food and a friendly staff."}
{"text":"First time visit. Food was excellent, decor was fun, place was clean.  Salsa was delicious. Sorry, forgot to take pictures but had the carne asada tacos. The lemonade was very good! The carne asada and fries my daughter had was enough for two!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  I'm addicted to the carne dilla!  Churros and carrot cake are also delicious!  The chorizo tacodilla is yummy too!"}
{"text":"Last night, at my son's school Fall Festival, United Lunchadores food truck had a long line of people. I've been longing for a fresh, homemade quesadilla, but didn't know where to find one. Now, I know!! By the time I got to the front of the line, the truck was running out of food and drinks. I ordered the steak and bleu dillas. OMG, I found exactly what I was looking for! The dillas was fresh and cooked to perfection.

Today, I had to have another dillas. I was willing to call and ask where the truck was going to be parked and get there! To my delight, United Lunchadores has a store front restaurant. Because it's closed on Sundays and Mondays, I told my hubby we had to go there for dinner.

I love the decor of the restaurant. The cashier is friendly and professional. The food was just as good tonight as it was last night. My family and I are making this our go to spot!"}
{"text":"Taco & Dilla Parlor was a nice surprise. You're a little hesitant when you drive into a sketchy strip mall, but when you walk in to this small restaurant, it looked bright, clean and Nacho Libre decorated. We get up to the counter and order the All Thai'd Up Dilla and a churro. The guy said the quesadillas are pretty big so we decided to share. The order came to $11 and when we received our food, we also got a good amount of chips and salsa. It was definitely enough to share for two people.

The Dilla was Dillacious!!! I've never had a quesadilla like that before with chicken, serranos, grilled onions, sweet Thai chili sauce and jack cheese. It's their most popular Dilla and I can see why! So good and so filling! The churro was ok - it was filled with cajeta and I wasn't a fan of the filling but my hubby liked it. 

Overall, I'm a fan - great food, great prices and no long waits!!"}
{"text":"This is one insane food truck and parlor!!! Food is always on point and I would highly recommend the All Thai'd Up!!! Eat from them if you ever get the chance!!!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is Ah-Maz-ing. The \"All Thai'd Up Quesadilla\" was sooo good. Amazing flavor with a good kick to it. My husband got standard carne street tacos and the flavor in the meet makes me snub my nose up at other taco places. The decor is really fun too. Good for small groups. Great service. Really fast too. My hubby said this is probably his new favorite spot. And we eat at a lot of taco places so that says something!"}
{"text":"I'm sort of cross-posting this as an update because I hired the Taco & Dilla Parlor's United Lunchadores Street Gourmet food truck to cater my wife's surprise 50th birthday party at our home this past Saturday evening.  Yes, you can get their delicious food catered right to your party! 
 To summarize the experience and the food:   TOP NOTCH IN EVERY IMAGINABLE WAY.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  THANK YOU FOR HELPING MAKE MY WIFE'S 50th BIRTHDAY AWESOME!!!!!!!

I expected perfection from these guys and they totally delivered on my expectations.    

Their clean art-deco paintjob truck arrived about an hour and a half early to begin their prep.  The point person Jerren was professional, courteous and did a great job representing the business.  In fact, ALL of the guys were friendly and accommodating.   They set up in front of the house, put out a stand-up menu board and table on the sidewalk with a utensil station, and they provided napkins and dinnerware etc.  They provided their own electricity and literally made it so that I did not have to do any work to prepare.    

As part of the catering arrangement, I preselected the Thai'd Up, Steak & Bleu and Papa Verde 'dillas along with the Citrus Chicken tacos and Carnitas tacos as the entree items for the evening.  I also selected the churros as a desert and a couple of flavors of their handcrafted Agua Frescas (drinks).  

On schedule, they began taking orders and promptly delivering food to our guests.  The feedback on the tacos and 'dillas was universally positive with the standout being the Steak & Blu 'dilla (see below description of each menu item along with guest feedback).  On top of everything, the guys put big \"5\" and \"0\" candles in a giant platter of their churros and delivered them into the house while everyone sang happy birthday to my wife!  This was really just an over the top great thing for them to do!  Everyone RAVED about the food.  The compliments I received proved I made the right decision by hiring United Lunchadores.  But the most important part was the feedback from my wife.  It was her surprise party, after all, and she was ecstatic!  She said that food really hit the spot and that she never would have thought of hiring a food truck for such a function.

Well, now we (and you) know, that this is a great way to go if you want to provide delicious food at a reasonable cost without all the associated work!   

From the beginning of the booking process with Jony to the end of the evening when Jerren discreetly settled up with me so that I didn't have to deal with any of the \"business\" stuff in front of my guests, this was a smooth, easy (and delicious) process.  I cannot possibly recommend Gypsy Restaurant Group and United Lunchadores Street Gourmet enough. 

Here are the menu items I preselected and paid for so that our guests only needed to tip on their own at time of service:  
-Thai'd Up 'dillas with grilled chicken, serrano peppers, onions, sweet Thai Sauce and Jack cheese (my personal favorite)
-Steak & Bleu 'dillas with Carne Asada, pico de gallo, Blue + Jack cheeses (the fan favorite at our party)
-Papa Verde 'dillas with potatoes, diced green chiles, pico de gallo and jack cheese (my wife's favorite at our party and a great vegetarian option)
-Citrus Chicken tacos and Carnitas tacos both garnished with cilantro, onions and lime wedge (taco eaters got one of each and said they were both amazing and easy to handle because of their size)
-Cajeta filled churros with berry dipping sauce (guests said these were the best churros they ever had)
-Handcrafted Tiger's Blood and Mango Orange Aqua Frescas (feedback was that these were delicious and many guests were bringing them into our home's bar and mixing them with tequila, flavored rum or vodka)"}
{"text":"I wish they were closer to chandler but it is worth the drive"}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood gem! The Papa Dilla is amazing! Great food, super friendly and very distinctive decor!"}
{"text":"Outstanding little taco shop!! But so much more than that. There's not a million things on the menu, but the four items I experienced were incredible! I left wishing I could keep eating so I could try everything else on the menu. The Carne Asada \"Dilla\" and tacos were ridiculously juicy and flavorful. The chicken tacos were overstuffed with big chunks of perfectly marinated and grilled chicken. The elote bowl took me back to my childhood... Definitely will be back and I can't wait! Telling al my friends about this, my new favorite taco shop!"}
{"text":"I've had the dillas from the Luncha Libre food truck many times and they are awesome. I'm happy to say that they are exactly the same at the Taco and Dilla Parlor! My favorite is the papa verde with chicken - it's loaded with big chunks of chicken, fried potatoes, and cheese. And I mean loaded - this is no thin quesadilla. It's so thick I usually eat it with a fork and knife. And usually get two meals out of it. The chips and salsa that come with it are also really good.  

I tried the tacos too and I though they were a just meh. They were a little dry and just sorta boring overall. They do not even begin to compare to the dillas. Between the two, I'd go dilla every time."}
{"text":"Awesome place to grab Mexican food to take home or dine in. They have a HUGE selection of meats (don't worry, you are allowed to sample) along with an assortment of toppings and a salsa bar. 

Prices are solid, not too expensive, for the portions."}
{"text":"Our first stop in Phoenix, literally got off the plane and went here. You must try this place. The service and hospitality was five star! The food is fresh and delicious. Before we leave we will be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"This is definitely a hidden gem in Phoenix! The carne asada quesadilla was freaking delicious. Super quick service!"}
{"text":"Brick and mortar food truck? I noticed there was a \"new\" Mexican joint and decided to give it a try. As I understand it, Luncha Libre has existed as a food truck for a while and have opened up a store front. I wasn't sure what to make of it as they only have two items on the menu: quesadillas and street tacos. I ordered a chicken quesadilla with green chilies added and was slightly put off by the $9 total. That seemed a little steep for a quesadilla. The first look at it blunted my doubts and the first bite erased them. I would be surprised if there was less than a full pound of chicken crammed into a tortilla. Skillfully marinated chicken breast, I should say. I would argue that this is the polar opposite of what you think a quesadilla can be. Ingredients are made/prepared fresh on site and seem to be of a consistently high quality. What they lack in menu quantity seems to be made up for in quality. They also have a \"snack shop\" next door. I was afraid to go in there but they did have samples of a chipotle chocolate cake. I'm not a big fan of chocolate cake but this has to be one of the best cakes I've ever tried. I can't stop thinking about it. I will be back to explore more of that tiny menu. And maybe even the other side where that cake came from..."}
{"text":"I seriously can't rave enough about the quesadillas. They are honestly a delicious, unique, HEAVENLY taste. Unlike any quesadilla....BETTER! We gobbled them up and went to pollo tacos. Also amazing! Yum yum. Run don't walk!"}
{"text":"If you see my somewhat embarrassing review for the Luncha Libre truck, you could imagine my excitement when I saw they were opening a restaurant. 

The restaurant itself is kind of small but has a great atmosphere. The decor is fun.

They have great aqua frescas that they serve in mason jars. Bring back the mason jar and you get discounted refills!

I had my usual: the potato dilla. Perfection as usual. I mean, c'mon. Fried potatoes, melty cheese, zesty green chilis. Drool...

I also ordered their bean burrito thinking it would be small because it was just a few bucks. Um, no. It was huge. That is a massive amount of food for a small price. And the burrito was tasty! Bean burritos may be simple but I'm super picky. It passed my test!

I hope they start serving beer soon!"}
{"text":"prices are a little too much for me, but the food flavors are definitely worth it.  I've enjoyed their food truckside, but this location is nice since it's close to work!  

I've had their lengua tacos which was done very softly since tongue can be very tough meat to cook, had their chicken papas verde and the thai chicken quesadilla.  All the food has been awesome and so delicious.  The guava/strawberry 'rita is my favorite and I've tried and have been unsuccessful at replicating it at home :(  Oh well, guess I'll have to stop by here to get my Luncha Fix.  

Chips are crunch and just the right amount of salt, and the salsa although not spicy, is still very tasty.

I've also had the tres leches cake and it's my favorite of any panaderia or restaurant."}
{"text":"Yeah...yum. Just so much yumminess.  My favorite food trucks to go spot. Super cute decor and even better food!  The frescas are amazing, the dillas are delicious  and the salsa is off the chain!"}
{"text":"Very good locally owned well made and reasonably priced food. Loved the counter staff, and large portions. 

The only reason for 1 less star are the hours are limited.

Will definitely be a regular here:)"}
{"text":"Orgasmic...simply put...just amazing. Their meat is juicy. Their flavors are to die for! I get the All Taid Up....sweet and spicy!! The people working are always so helpful and fun to talk with. One of our favorite Hidden Gems..."}
{"text":"Just ate here tonight for the first time! Yum!! Got the thai'd up dilla and loved the sweet Thai flavor mixed with the salsa. My son wasn't going to eat at first (he was being bratty and said he wasn't going to eat because he wanted a burger). Right when he saw the dilla, he quickly changed his mind. He devoured his chicken dilla and next time I'm sure he'll order without hesitation. We will be back! Oh yes, I recommend ordering extra salsas if you are taking out- they give a 2oz container, but it is so yummy that if you are like me, it's gone in the first 2 bites:)"}
{"text":"Excellent place, very creative menu.  I will be back often!!!!  I had the \"All Thai'ed Up\" taco, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Local & close to us. We love the Carne Asada Tacos and the Chicken Dilla and the Cold Brew (served in mason jar)."}
{"text":"This place is everything! The tacos come small but they are authentically delicious and the quesadillas are like a cross between a hearty grilled wrap and a stuffed quesadilla...so good and big enough to where you can take half leftover. I highly recommend ordering queso with your chips! Homemade queso, it's some of the best I've ever had. Also, the Tigers blood drink is amazing and fruity and it's worth getting because it's served in a huge mason jar that you get to keep. If you're looking for something casual where you can sit down or something you can carry out, this it it and you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Yum.. so glad I found this place! I saw them first on Instagram.. read the reviews on Yelp and I was in the neighborhood on taco Tuesday! 

Located in a strip mall .. when you step in it's like the Day of the Dead and Lucha Libre moved in together .. color and funny things everywhere! 

The menu is easy to navigate .. street tacos, quesadillas and aguas frescas (the important stuff).. 

On today's visit I had the taco de lengua which was tender and flavorful, green salsa & avocado .. the taco de asada equally yummy and the tacosito which is the folded taco dorado this is a chorizo beef mix with a lime flavor.. 

Even though I saw the Yelp checkin for the free Mexican coke in the bottle .. I had to try the aguas Fresca.. it's 105 outside .. the tigers blood with coconut water was delicious!!

The chips and salsa were not terrible but were just average compared to the food .. 

I will be back for sure .."}
{"text":"OMG get the Thai quesadilla! Traditionalists in the Mexican food arena are going to have to open their minds, because they specialize in making interesting and exciting combinations. The quesadillas are HUGE, and sssssooooo delicious. They include chips and salsa with their meals and these are not the standard Mexican restaurant chips. They must make their own or order from a better vendor than most of the others. The tacos are also huge, and they are amazing! Eat here!"}
{"text":"I stalk the food truck during at work to get it for lunch and love the restaurant!! They're customer service is amazing and so is the food! Great quality and quantity."}
{"text":"Literally every quesadilla is phenomenal you cannot go wrong with anything you get on the menu I would recommend this to every single person that I've ever met in my life!!!"}
{"text":"I don't go to this place as much as I would like to but when I do, they never disappoint. The quesadillas are the best in Phoenix, hands down. Some might say the portions are small, and I can see that. But if you want a bigger portion, that just means the food is good and you want more. So that speaks volume to the attention and detail into picking the right flavors and ingredients of their food. The carne and bleu is my go to. You get what you pay for and this place is deserving of my money and should deserve yours too."}
{"text":"I had three tacos (they made them vegetarian and I think they should add these to the menu because they're great ((peppers onions potatos and avocado))). Two of them filled me up and the 3rd was lunch the next day. The tortillas are very authentic too. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm very picky when it comes to Mexican food. The Steak & Blue quesadilla is creatively delicious. They're fresh fruit juices are right on target with not being too sweet or unflavorful. Between the authentic decor, music, positive staff spirit, this place has definitely won me over and I will become a regular. Nice job guys! I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today and it was great. All the food seems to be made from scratch. The four different tacos were very good and they come with chips too. Ask for the hot sriracha salsa as it has a good kick. The torta and carne fries sounded yummy."}
{"text":"Other worldly, celestial, quesadillas cut from the genes of God himself. This food belongs in museums with the likes of Rembrandt!  Awesome owner, sweet aesthetics & hidden just right."}
{"text":"I tried the Carnitas and Carne tacos. They were really good. I asked for some hot salsa and was informed they had a habanero salsa for an extra .50 The salsa was very good with a lot of heat.  Overall, I thought it was a little pricey, but the tacos are very good quality and a bit larger than your typical street taco. One negative point. The tacos didn't come with salsa so you have to purchase it for an extra .50 as I mentioned above. Come on, $12 for tacos, throw in some salsa for free."}
{"text":"Cool spot in a sketchy strip mall. Quality, flavorful ingredients. Great salsa, value, and cool folks working there. Worth a stop for sure"}
{"text":"Wow did we get lucky stumbling on Taco & Dilla! Don't skip the Thai dilla, just delicious. The people there are SUPER friendly, felt like we were having lunch at a friends house. Nice job!"}
{"text":"It is not often that you get several \"BEST I EVER HADS\" at one restaurant at one time but my husband and I had that experience at Taco Dilla. I had the bean burrito which was the best and most flavorful I had. My husband had the All Thai'd Up quesadilla and proclaimed it the BEST EVEr. Then he had the churro which he said was the BEST he ever tasted. Fabulous food, fun decor a real hidden gem!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The flavor and ingredients are superb!! I had the Thai dilla, which was bomb and my boyfriend's carne dilla was amazing. We would go back again and again!!"}
{"text":"I haven't had every quesadilla in town but I find it hard to believe that there is one that's better than the All Thai'd Up."}
{"text":"By far, our favorite! We seriously dig the owners and that it is a small business, but you also can't beat the food! We first tried it from the food truck- the Sonoran hot dog and Papas dilla and we were hooked. Then they opened the parlor... Oh, the joy! I wish I could point out my favorite, but have to say- just try one of everything! Such a variety (All Thai'd Up dilla to the Steak and Bleu to their special of the day...). And now, flan. You can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Not only is the food at this place delicious, they are super speedy at making it and have amazing customer service. We used postmates to get delivery from here and they forgot half of our order. I called Taco & Dilla and they personally delivered the food to us. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I loved the MacDaddy with Carne Asada! I also ordered two pollo Asada tacos on the side! My Lovely Woman had the Carne Asada Dilla and was pleased as well! I definitely recommend the Pineapple Drink in the Mason Jar. Yes you get to keep it! Refills available as well! I look forward to going back and having some more tacos as well trying the Carne Asada Fries!"}
{"text":"A new favorite! We had fresh mango and strawberry juice which is served in 32 oz mason jars. It was so fresh and delicious. We got the Mac Daddy and Steak and Bleu quesadillas which were huge, amazing, and sooo delicious. I took half of mine home. Our order came with a basket of fresh chips and sides of salsa, and our quesadillas were served with the same. The chips were cute and little but thick and satisfying. Everything was so fresh. Is probably eat here every day if I lived closer."}
{"text":"Tried street tacos and the potatoe dillas and added chicken.  Dillas was very good and huge.  Street tacos were decent..really tender carne..just needed a lil more flavor overall but very good meal and cool lil restaurant.  Nice staff as well."}
{"text":"We stopped in here to grab some lunch to take home one day. The employee was helpful in figuring out what to order for our group. 

Definitely get the carne asada fries, they were delicious! Flavorful meat and they certainly did not skimp on the cheese. The dilla's were good too! I had a carnitas one and it had a good flavor. 

Portions here are pretty big so most people can comfortably share dishes. Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I'm shocked that this place has such good reviews. We saw the 4.5 star rating and knew we had to try it. Long story short... we were disappointed. 

The tacos were dry and the flavor was soooo overpowering and salty. 

The salsa has no flavor and was watery.

The street corn was..... bad. Definitely canned or frozen corn and the flavor was just not great.

My boyfriend liked his quesadilla but it was massive and soggy. 

The chips were decent. 

They were nice and the service was quick. I'm sure the people are nice and some people like the food- but it's just not for us!"}
{"text":"Don't let the strip mall vibe deter you. The food is totally awesome, the service is terrific, and the decor is ... interesting! I had chicken tacos and they were the best ever ... juicy and perfectly seasoned. My date had the chicken tacos, too, and thought they were excellent. I loved the decor: a talented artist painted many different pictures featuring Day of the Dead motifs. The coolest part is that the drinks are served in Ball jars, which we could keep for a return trip. The Tiger's Blood shouldn't be missed, although the lemonade was great, too. When we are back in the area, we'll def be back!"}
{"text":"First timer, LOVE IT! fat happy camper, will be back!"}
