{"text":"Good food at a reasonable price... all the staff at this location are very pleasant... they answer the phone quickly"}
{"text":"I love this place.   I can say that I have never had anything here that has left me wanting more.  The staff is always really nice regardless of how busy they are and there's always a ton of different types of pizzas to try if you're going the lunchtime route.  Favorite pizza is the chicken pesto with BBQ chicken a very close second."}
{"text":"We eat here all the time. Pizza is really good and the restaurant has a relaxed family vibe without being too relaxed. The employees are always helpful and energetic. A general lament for pizza places, I always wish they would spend little time making a really simple, really good side salad. I love salad with pizza. But otherwise, we love it and will keep coming back."}
{"text":"I love their pizza, but their delivery and customer service are lacking.  After many years of ordering from them, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Not good at all. We went in around two on Veterans day. Saw the pizza cook swat a fly over a giant pizza and miss it, but instead knock a shelf that held a magic marker and his drink which both fell on to the pizza. He removed them and proceeded to cut and serve the pizza.  We later joked about the cleanliness when we saw him go to the bathroom. We waited to hear the loud hand dryer in the mens room. We never heard it. We did see him exit with wet hands. My calzone was definitely undercooked.Rest of food was okay. Even the cashier was really out of it and not helpful or warm and greeting. Gladly there are many other pizza places to try."}
{"text":"After living in Italy, depending on which pizza you get I'd say they are pretty tasty and authentic more like New York style though. Definitely recommend this place to others! Tables usually aren't cleaned promptly but we always seem to come when its busy so it's understandable."}
{"text":"The pizza is fantastic. They always have cheese ready to go, which is great when you are vegetarian. The atmosphere is good. The staff could step it up a bit but it doesn't bother me too much. The buy ten slices get one free is great.  This is a good place to just drop in for a slice on your way home from where ever you were. Love it."}
{"text":"Best casual pizza place in Tempe. I grew up in New York and this is the closest thing to New York pizza I've had in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Update: Manager called and apologized for the mix-up, gave us a credit for next order. Very much appreciated!!  Really good. Double check the delivery - open every box and container. The Large Antipasto Salad we ordered, and paid for per the receipt in the box, ended up being a plain Garden Salad (Ticket #351 7/29/17). Added our own \"ham, salami, pepperoni, mozzarella cheese, red onions, black olives, tomatoes\" to save the day. And really, the description needs to say 'crouton', singular, not plural. Oh, the website is a mess - don't even try to reorder from your previous orders list, just create a new order."}
{"text":"I  am not a pizza lover by nature.  But my husband loved the shop in Tempe.  Not only is the pizza delicious, but the salads are wonderful also.  And, the boneless wing, yum! We eat here at least once a week."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised. Inside of restaurant is new, nice, clean. They had good music playing (rock/alternative), and 5 flat screens with sports on. They have pizza specials, so we got slices and drinks. FYI happy hour is M-F 2 to 5pm (you get $1 off the specials). We tried cheese, margherita, pesto chicken, and meat lovers. We all liked the pizza. The cheese was my favorite actually. Large, thin slices (for anyone who hasn't been there)."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I recently relocated and could not find a place that would deliver to my apartment?? I found this place, read some reviews and decided to give it a shot. So happy I did! Everything was delicious! I ordered a small cheese pizza, antipasto salad and cheesecake with strawberries. More than enough for 2 people. They were right on time and the delivery driver was very nice."}
{"text":"This place is great! We ordered the mozzarella sticks, boneless honey BBQ wings, and the chicken BBQ pizza. Everything was beyond delicious! We will definitely be eating here again!"}
{"text":"Ok so um first of all, its shown on the tv series Breaking Bad...so why wouldn't you try this place?  I just need to one day take a pizza and throw it on my house...just for the experience.  Wait no I couldn't do that as I'd be sad that I didn't eat the deliciousness...anger could never get me to throw that pizza.  Anyway, awesome lunch special.  Pizza, salad and a drink for 6.75.  This is pretty much my favorite pizza in the east valley."}
{"text":"I want to thank you for offering us another chance to try your pizza's. This time around our meal was much more flavorful. Excellent customer service!!"}
{"text":"If you want NY style pizza do not go to this place. It was okay however for two okay slices was $7. The size of the slice was big and the crust had the New York crunch but the sauce was okay and cheese was just there. I would not go out of my way to eat there but if it is there it is there."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this pizzeria. The food is amazing, and the portion sizes are huge for the price you pay. It's dangerous living around the corner from this restaurant because it's so easy to just say \"I'm too tired to cook dinner, let's go to Venezia's\".   The food, the service, the atmosphere...everything is great. They have a bit of a problem with flies outside (and sometimes inside, but not that often), but I guess that's a price you pay to be able to eat outside in nice weather.  I highly recommend this Venezia's."}
{"text":"Solid pizza, delicious boneless wings, and real salads (ie, not iceburg). They serve pizza by the slice whether it's lunch or dinner. Nice to see them open a store up here in north phoenix."}
{"text":"I've never seen a single episode of Breaking Bad. I've never thought that New York style pizza was in any way superior to other styles of pizza. I was not even sure why I was at Venezia's recently. I needed to be convinced.  I was struck by all the young families present. Early dinner. Makes sense, but they were there in numbers, drawn I suspect by a good selection of kids meals and pizza sold buy the slice.   My husband took care of the ordering, so I couldn't help but be surprised, impressed and amused, when a massive party pizza arrived at our table. The kids loved it. I was impressed not just by its size, but that it was perfectly cooked throughout. Maybe these New Yorkers are onto something with their style. We also had a nicely prepared salad.  Convinced I was. Now time to binge watch Breaking Bad I suppose."}
{"text":"I went there on 05/31/2015 around 11 am  for lunch and ordered a hot hero ' I told the counter guy I only wanted a sausage ,pepper, and onion hero on white and a small soda. He asked if I wanted fries and I said no and I restated (2nd time) I only wanted the sausage, pepper and onion hero on white and a small soda. My receipt indicated I was the 3rd lunch customer since they opened and the place was void of patrons. At 1125 am my hero arrived with items on it I did not want such as sauce, mozzarella, parmesan and god knows what other ingredients. I told the waitress all I requested was a sausage pepper and onion hero she offered to redo the order I told her that would not be necessary and she went back into the kitchen after looking at the hero for a moment I decided to take her up on her offer and walk over to the counter and handed over the hero to another employee who it took the hero back into the kitchen. The original counter guy who took my order stopped by and  proceeded to tell me how bland the hero would be without the added on ingredients I thought to myself wow how stupid can one be to acknowledge that to a diner any way another 10 minutes went by and still no hero I decided to leave due to I had only 45 minutes for lunch and I already spent 40 minutes waiting and as far as I am concerned they can take that hero and shove it where the sun don't shine."}
{"text":"My new favorite neighborhood pizza place. The slice and wings lunch deal is the best!  Today I had a calzone. It rocked too."}
{"text":"Visited Venezia's for the first time today and all I can say is Wow!  We ordered a large one topping pizza, garden salad and wings and all three were a home run.  The pizza was awesome, the garden salad was the best I have ever had at a casual dining establishment.The food was delivered to our table by a really nice young lady who brought us our plates and utensils when she saw we needed them, because we did not know to get them at the soda station area.  She continued to check on us and we really appreciated her sweetness. The restaurant was clean and we noticed the beautiful framed photos by Jaime who is one of the owners...great photography! Run, don't walk for a great meal at an affordable price with great service. Good job Dominick and Jaime....please build one in north Scottsdale"}
{"text":"I have ordered from this Venezia's since they first opened. The food is always wonderful, I have ordered most everything on the menu & it is aways great."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a good local pizza joint to satisfy my thin crust and monster slice cravings. Venezia's does deliver in this department. The pizza is NY style, big slices, and very good sauce with a bit of spice to it. The crust is good (not great) and this becomes a little more noticeable when eating leftovers the next day. Eating a slice of cold pizza separates a great pie from a bad one in this foodie's book. Great pizza is still rockin' good whether cold or reheated. Average pies get rubbery or chewy. Their pizza was just OK on Day 2.   This would normally warrant 3 stars, but I also got a side of wings and Venezia's totally nailed them. I'm a wing snob (no, that's not an oxymoron) and I've definitely been to places that have no clue how to make a decent chicken wing. I paid the extra $1 to get all drums and they were very nice and meaty. I always order medium buffalo style the first time to gauge how spicy their sauce is. The sauce was just the way i like it, with the right amount of heat to make it enjoyable. I seriously could have skipped the pie and just eaten the wings that night. They were so large that I only ate half the order (and they tasted just fine reheated on Day 2)...   I'll be back to get my pizza and wing fix again, though I'd probably opt for a smaller pie and an extra order of wings next time.   Enjoy!  The East Valley Foodie"}
{"text":"Great food but their online and telephone ordering process is pretty rough.  Had serious problems trying to order online so called in and was put on hold multiple times, shuffled between different people, rushed during the order and it sounded like the other person was in a rock concert and couldn't hear me."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  I've been here many times, and the food is very good.  Love the NY style pizza.  I usually keep it simple- pepperoni, though the Cibola with chorizo is also very good.  Their wings are also very good - as long as you stick with the bone-in wings.  Plenty of sauce on 'em - for some reason more here than at the other locations."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent customer of this pizzeria.  In the beginning, it was hit and miss, then had a string of good experiences.  Tonight I ordered a pizza half peppers and onions, half plain.  My grandson took a slice of plain and all the cheese slid off.  My peppers and onions slice was very watery.  Then we discovered the rest of the plain half wasn't even Sliced!  Really? You need to start paying attention to details or you will start losing customers.  Oh yes, I went to use the coupons delivered on the last pizza but they were already out of date.  I've given you many strikes - you may be out!"}
{"text":"By far one of the better pizza places in the valley. Only suggestion I would make for the owners would be to update the website (it functions just fine) to make it easier for customer use, and more modern."}
{"text":"The pizza was amazing, would definitely go here again. Management should consider hiring help on work ethic. Pet peeve is seeing help standing around talking while customers are looking for a clean table to sit at. But that wouldn't keep me from going back. Some of the best pizza I've had."}
{"text":"I am a very loyal customer! The best pizza and wings in Arizona. We are from NY and it's as close as you will get! The food is always fresh and consistent! I wouldn't go anywhere else for pizza or wings (except NY). Thank you Venezia's!"}
{"text":"This was our first time trying yet another, claiming to be \"New York\" pizza.  Being a born and bred New Yawka, I have to say, it was pretty good.  Since I had a coupon, figured I'd give it a try.  I asked at the counter if they were REALLY from NY and was happy to hear they are from Da Bronx!  We didn't dine in but took our plain cheese home.  Crust and sauce were both tasty, cheese good and just enough grease to remind me of home.  I'd definitely be willing to dine in next time and try them again, with something other than a plain cheese pizza!  Since we aren't big fans of NYPD and Streets, this is a good alternative!  Now, if they can make a killer chicken parm hero, I'll be sold forever!  Definitely worth the try people!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and wings! They have the same taste as chili's wings!! Great service!! Lots of tv for sports!"}
{"text":"We finally had the opportunity to try the new pizza place.  We were so looking forward to Friday night pizza.  Their ample and fresh toppings, great.  Crust and sauce were not to my liking, however."}
{"text":"Having livined in Boston with runs to Brooklyn, NY, we know pizza the way it should be. Had pizza from Venezia's last night and it is the best we have had in the Valley."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that I REALLY want to like.  The people that work there are very friendly and nice...and the music they play is really good.  Unfortunately I keep having bad experiences with their food.    Today I tried their Chicken Parmigiana Hero and I can seriously say it was the worst one I've EVER had.  It was served on a roll that was made completely soggy by the runny marinara they slopped on it.  What little chicken I could find -- was a tiny, thin piece that could have easily fit on one half of the roll with plenty of room left over. Then to top it off the marinara had a weird flavor.  I've had a number of these kinds of sandwiches in all kinds of restaurants -- and as I wrote above this was hands down the worst I've ever had.  Seriously.  I had no better luck with what they call a Philly Cheese Steak.  I'm not from Philly...but I've had some good ones...and what ever this was...it shouldn't be called a Philly Cheese Steak.  It was just plain bad.  Another time I tried a ham and pineapple slice of pizza. Look -- I know to some people that's heresy when it comes to pizza...and normally I'd strongly disagree...but at Venezia's it was really awful.  I think I'll give this place a few more chances...because it stays reasonably busy...and some of the pizza I've seen other people get looks pretty good...but so far I've been disappointed.  I'll give it two stars because the people there are cool...otherwise based on the food alone -- they'd have gotten just one star."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Venezia's! The staff is amazing and food is outstanding. Adelina and Nicole are fantastic and make the experience even better! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Had the pepperoni & sausage slice, pesto chicken slice & it was delicious! A lot of places say \"NY\" but this was pretty darn close. Huge slices! Had a canoli also! Definitely will be back when in the area!"}
{"text":"This is now one of my favorite places to eat. I had the good original pepperoni pizza and a mild wings. The pizza is quick and easy, the wings were perfectly soft and easy to chew, and their menu is easily readable. However the only concern I had was that the staff didn't seem very helpful or friendly. Otherwise the service was fast and I will definitely be coming back for another round of pizza!"}
{"text":"I love Venezia's. I always order a simple slice of cheese pizza and I've never been disappointed. One slice fills me up and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch for the first time at 1:30 on Saturday. We ordered garlic bread and a caprese salad. The girl who took our order was friendly and welcoming, but the other employees were not. They were busy chatting loudly (to the point where we could here them gossiping about customers). It took about 15 minutes to get our bread and the salad didn't come out until 10 min later. The food was good but the service was not."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to the opening since I found out it was only a mile from my house.  We ordered a pie to go.  Big disappointment.  You really should not call a pizza, \"New York Style\", when all it has in common with a NYC pie is that it is round and has 8 slices.  The crust was much way too chewy and the taste gave me flashbacks to a Pizza Hut personal pie I had years ago.  Maybe I really miss the nearly 50 years of pizza eating I had back in New York, but I'll have to keep searching for that real NY pizza here in the valley"}
{"text":"I got the marghita pizza, which was very good. Exactly how I like it.  The tiramisu was ok,  I've had better.  My boyfriend got the cheese pizza he said it was ok snd the crumb cake was delious. Delivery was fast and courteous.  I will order from this place again. I highly recommend the marghita pizza and crumb cake."}
{"text":"Great pizza and service at a great price. Quality ingredients definitely make this a favorite of our family's! The sausage has excellent flavor. Try the lasagna or ziti- you won't regret it! The Caesar salad and buffalo wings are great, too! The fact that they serve China Mist passion tea is the icing on the cake!"}
{"text":"In all fairness I only went once, and they were only open a few weeks, but WOW the chaos.  They screwed up our order, they overcharged us, they didn't deliver my salad (that we paid for), then they said they would take it off...we never did see the credit on our bank statement.  The pizza was average at best, but the staff working was incredibly clueless and there was no manager.  The response was, \"We don't have one working at the moment.\"  You are a new place without a manager????  I really try not to review places after only one experience, but it's hard to go back when there are so many other options for pizza."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the mozzarella sticks! They hit the spot every time! I also really enjoy the slice and wings combo, for under $10 you can get a slice and wings (bone in or boneless) AND a drink! I've gotten the big party pizza multiple times and shared it with about 10 people at a neighborhood party. The customer service is outstanding, the employees are always ready to take your order and answer any questions you have!"}
{"text":"I have been ordering from here for the last eight years and the only reason I didn't give five stars is because I grew up on the east coast and my pizza standards are extremely high. I don't love their sauce, but it is better then most in Az. I am also not a huge fan of the chicken parm heroes or the calzones. My husband does love their meatball heroes though. One of my favorite pizzas to have is white pizza and I must admit I was so reluctant to try theirs (because I didn't like the calzones) that I waited seven years to do so. Once I did, however, I was pleasantly surprised. It is really good and I get a small pie for myself every time we order now. My husband prefers the regular cheese pizza and I still think it's the best I have tried in Az. Their slices are nice and big and their party pizzas are huge. We usually order one so we have leftovers to freeze. I also really enjoy their wings but only get the hot wings if you really like it hot!"}
{"text":"The food is always excellent here. However our service wasn't so great. The cashier/server named Chrissy had a major attitude problem and literally tossed our plates at us and rolled her eyes when we asked a question. Hopefully we won't come across her again because we LOVE Venezia's."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I ordered delivery and got a thin crust veggie pizza.. Was so soggy and it was the grossest thing ever. Go in the next day to try some of there other stuff out.. Because I was please with the slice of cheese pizza I ordered. So I ordered fries and waited 40 min for them.. The restaurant had 2 other groups of people in it so it wasn't very busy at all.. They didn't bother to check on us or anything.. There service is terrible. I work at a pizza place and this would not fly there."}
{"text":"Have ordered twice from here and the service is TERRIBLE.  The first time I complained to the manager for the long wait, he gave me a credit to use the next time I came in.  But he did not seem very concerned.  Then this past weekend, the order was wrong!  Called after I got home to let them know and the manager went above and beyond to make it right.  You only get two stars because of the service.  Food is decent but priced high.  You can get the same if not better pizza (more for your money) elsewhere.  I will ONLY be giving this place a third try because of the current manager.  He seems to want to make a change in the service and make things right.  I will update once I have tried again."}
{"text":"yes, love this pizza. Thanks to our daughter for trying it out... and now we are not too far from it, they deliver!!! Good taste, good price. Delivery people and staff at counter are always nice!"}
{"text":"I ordered from this location online through yelp and it was super easy! Everything was made as ordered, and it was delivered more that 15 minutes prior to the time I was given. Also I may have a mild food crush on the honey mild wing sauce."}
{"text":"I love their pizza. They have an amazing thin-crusted pizza that is to die for whether you get it with pesto or marinara sauce. Not to mention they have tons of unique toppings combinations (including salad.) But a specialty is their GIANT pizzas. Giant as in, \"Holy shoot this doesn't fit in the back of my car.\" giant. But still delicious. I'd definatley try it if you want to feed a lot of people."}
{"text":"Polite and courteous employees even on a busy Friday evening. I liked the atmosphere on the inside and outside. They have some games for kiddos to play outside. The seating on the inside is spacious and comfortable. The pizza and pasta with salad were very good. The service was relatively quick for a Friday evening so that was very impressive."}
{"text":"Just barely opened, a little unorganized still.  But great pizza, especially the Margherita pizza.  Great deal on XL's on Fridays."}
{"text":"Great food every time. I usually get a bbq chicken pizza with bacon. Their wings are pretty good as well, especially the boneless. Friendly customer service every time and my food is always on time."}
{"text":"Over 2 yrs since my original post and I still love this place. Great pizza and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings! Ordered delivery a very tall and handsome gentleman wearing a broncos hat delivered my order. He was polite and quick 10/10"}
{"text":"I tried this restaraunt through Grubhub. This was by far the worst food I have ever had. For starters, the fried zucchini looked and tasted like it was fried last week then when they need it they microwave it. The coating was tough when chewing and the insides were mush. The pizza was wretched. The crust was greasy and over cooked, the toppings were almost black. The flavors were disgusting, I think it was old. The lasagna was so salty and I would guess also microwaved and old food. I threw away the chicken that came with my salad because I was afraid to eat it. For the amount of money I spent I will NEVER try them again. I ended up throwing almost all of it away and even the bit I ate made my stomach hurt the next day."}
{"text":"On my first time here I sighed with happiness while I ate my cheese pizza slice with lots of crushed red pepper and parm.  So flavorful with perfect crust.  We don't live in the area, so we've tried other Phoenix locations and been very disappointed.  I will travel to Mesa for my fix!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever great service great atmosphere clean can't say enough about how wonderful the pizza is"}
{"text":"Love the gluten free pizza . My family has never been disappointed w anything on the menu ."}
{"text":"Good pizza, okay wings, nice atmosphere. Their service is generally good, but I went on a Friday night when they were slammed and they forgot to put my order in. Understandable considering how busy they were, but that's my difference from a four to a three. 45 minute wait with a one year old was frustrating. I would have liked an apology from management."}
{"text":"Always fast and delicious. Staff is friendly. I come here weekly. Pepperoni pizza slice is as good as there is in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I'm from New England. I know what proper, Big Town, thin-crust pizza is. My favorite pizza joint in the world is in Grand Central. One slice, two bucks, the size of your head, from a business operating out of about 100 sq ft. Heaven on pepperoni earth.  Can you get that pizza here in PHX? Nope. You can't get that pizza ANYWHERE but NYC, SON. Please.  Can you do the damndest you can to get as close as possible and be happy about it?  Hells yes.  I tried every single place that delivered to my location here at the intersection of the 101 and 51 on the north side of the valley... and Venezia's is PIZZA, baby. Thin crust, well done as requested, they don't skimp on my bacon or pineapple - it's as good as it's gonna get... until I go back home again.  Oh... they also make a MEAN Philly cheese-steak (no, not as good as the ones I had in Philly, but again... as close as you're gonna get living in the freakin' desert) and if you say no to macaroni and cheese bites deep fried and dipped in ranch sauce well, you need psychiatric help. Seriously. Just... eat them and go to the ER if you have to, you'll still think it was worth it.  Keep it up, Venezias. If you can find a way to make a slice of pie not flop over but stay straight when I fold it for eating like pizza is properly eaten - you will get SIX stars... but like everyone says - \"it's the water.\"  For all of you \"AHM FRUM NU YAWK N DIS AINT CITY PIZZA\" whiners, well... sober up. You live in the middle of the desert. Please tell me where better NYC style thin crust pizza can be had. I'm all ears."}
{"text":"When it's good it's great. When it's not it's really disappointing.  My family has been ordering from here for over two years. We have seen the consistency of the food and the help go down hill.  The past 3 times we have ordered they did not get our order right. One of which was an online order. On this occasion, the kitchen staff misinterpreted the ticket because the online system apparently doesn't print them correctly. (According to the manager I spoke to). They comped my meal that time, but honestly I just wanted them to fix the problems so I can keep coming here.  Tonight we called in the order for pickup, ordered the wings and pizza well done. The pizza was well done but had a ton of sauce which sort of defeats the purpose. The wings were cooked but not well done as ordered. The ticket didn't reflect the way I ordered it and I repeated it back twice. The young kid who answered the phone got the pizza order and was ready to hang up without getting the wing and breadstick order.    The management needs to retrain some of their employees.  I don't want something for nothing. I want them to fix the training issues so I can keep being a loyal customer.  Manager, Take note. Sometimes customers complain because they just want to bring a problem to your attention so you can address it, not because they want free dinner."}
{"text":"I don't know what is is about this pizza I don't like but it just a little weird to me...the service is pretty great and delivery is too. If your going to have a party this is your go too with the BIG one!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered pizza for delivery. It's good pizza but not great pizza. Delivery was on time and delivery guy was nice."}
{"text":"Peter did an excellent job of explaining the menu, helped me decide the ideal calzone, and maintained  great professionalism"}
{"text":"I love the pizza.  My friends tell me to try the sandwiches and the meatballs - that they are great - but I can never get past the pizza - YUM!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great! We got meat lovers and veggie pizza, it was awesome! Also got some chickens wings and bread stick all was yummy! We were so full. Total food porn for us! Service was good, always good. This is going to be our fam pizza spot. Place was decent size and cool. TV on sound corners. Def coming back for more."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and repeatedly I have had pork on my cheese pizza.  I don't eat pork and so this is very frustrating.  I would understand once, but it's happened at least 4 times.  My patience with them is due to the exceptional experience at other locations including Chandler (Ray) and Mesa (Ellsworth)."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to trying this place out. I love a good slice of NY style pizza and others loved it so why not?  We ordered a BBQ Chicken and a Hawaiian Pizza. Both were below average in our opinion though the Hawaiian was decent cold the next day ( ha, I know not good). We also got their wings though and they earned them a second star as they were above average. Will I return?  Maybe, but I'll get just a slice of plain cheese pizza. Maybe that's where I should have gone in the first place. There's just too many pizza places out there for a below average experience to warrant many more chances."}
{"text":"Another yummy place. Pizza delish! the best around for true cannoli's. absolutely great"}
{"text":"The pizza here is fantastic! By the slice, or get a whole pizza. The slice size is giant and the flavors are amazing. Definitely give this place a try if you're in the area and need a pizza fix."}
{"text":"Never been to NYC to have an authentic NY style slice, but for me this is the best NY style pizza in the East Valley. Usually pretty quick getting it out to you amd staff is always friendly and happy. Buffalo style Chicken pizza is pretty good. Wings are great bone in or bone out. New gold flavor wings are excellent. Solid place, I've never felt like I wasted my time or money."}
{"text":"Update***** Venezia's is great most of the time. However, lately, the quality can be very inconsistent on busy nights (Friday and Saturday). A top notch Pizza restaurant should pride itself on consistently producing high quality pies no matter how busy."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a decent slice of New York pizza in the valley this is a great place to start. Venezia's Pizza is a step above most of the pizza in the valley. Customer service is great but you will want to order ahead on Friday night if you are doing takeout because the secret is out about this small chain that has several locations. The pizza has flavor...something that is missing from a lot of places... the cheese has that good salty taste of real pizza with sauce that also makes you want more. I for one like to opt for pepperoni and green olives as the perfect combo of taste. The pizza here if you get the New York style by the slice is huge and they have a wonderfully huge party pan pizza that is so huge that they have on going contest for two people to eat one to get your photo on the wall. They also have a Sicilian pizza if you are into that sort of thing  as well which is huge. Wings are good and they do a slice deal with wings and a beer at some locations that is pretty affordable. So to sum it up... come here if you want some real pizza."}
{"text":"SO good! We always ask for extra crispy pizza crust (they leave it in the oven for a longer period of time). Must try the pesto chicken pizza."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and have the best pizza. Get the Italian stallion it's so good and has a little kick to it."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in the Phoenix area. They have specials every day of the week."}
{"text":"Place is bomb. Food, customer service, price, everything. Hands down best pizza and wings."}
{"text":"Busy place on a Saturday night. Fast service. Pizza is good - could have used a bit more pepperoni on the pepperoni pizza. They serve slices and have combo specials that seem reasonably priced and could come in handy some day for a quick lunch.    They make a huge 24 inch party pizza that seems to be pretty popular - we'll probably get one or 2 of those for our next party."}
{"text":"We were over in this area visiting family, and decided to order take out so that we could watch the game. I always like to try pesto pizza from different places. The pizza was good, but a lot more oily than I like. The salad and the boneless wings were very good. I still really like their pizza, but probably won't get the pesto one again.  Love their thin crust."}
{"text":"The food and service are great, but the facility itself is kind of dirty especially the floors. They had 15 people working there and nobody could have picked up a broom and cleaned the floor a little?"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Venezia's in a while, so I stopped by after work to give it another try, hoping for improvement.  Ordered the Park Avenue pizza and an order of wings. Actually, I ordered the wings and a pizza...the wings being my main reason and focus. Can you say, BLUCK!  They were SO dry and tough! WHY...PLEASE TELL ME WHY it's SO hard to make good wings??? When I go to Buffalo to visit family, I NEVER get such dried up tough chicken wings. So disappointed.  The pizza was just okay. It was edible, but nothing I'd go back for.  My search for good pizza & wings continues..."}
{"text":"My office had this pizza for delivery once. I just moved near by and stopped in. So good. Pizza by the slice, I asked for well done and it was perfect. This will be a regular lunch spot! Price is right too!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. From the moment I walked in. It was clean, I was greeted respectfully by Christine at the front counter. We sat down at our clean table, and in a timely fashion our food come out. AMAZING PIZZA!  It was brought out Jerome to us by Joey. Great guys!!! Brought us our plates and everything. (Because we didn't see them). Haha. Great place. Great guys great pizza!!  I own a business myself. And I will say. My hat goes off to the team at Venezias!!!   Great place to run for quick bite to eat or a dinner date. BEST CUSTOMER SEEVICE SINCE I MOVED TO AZ 1yr ago."}
{"text":"Good pizza! I love that you are able to order by the slice. It makes it to easy to stop in for a quick lunch. I did not try their desserts but they looked delicious! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great...convenient to everything in NE Mesa. Whenever I see little pizza shops like this with all new decor, I always think how long they'll be around. These guys are here to stay! Food is excellent, and their deals of the day are a good reason to come grab a slice pretty much anytime."}
{"text":"Not so great. Order delivery last night, love the online ordering system- super easy. We ordered hot bbq wings, loved that you could pick all drums or wings. We got all drums and the sauce was decent but the wings were over cooked, dry and weirdly crispy. Not a fan of them and we have pretty much the whole box left.  We also order the pizza bianco which sounded tasty but had way, way, way too much ricotta cheese, it had a whole layer of it an overwhelmed the entire pizza. Because of the ricotta overload the pizza had a very mushy texture and the rest of the cheese that was sitting on the ricotta just slide off. Worst white pizza I had in a long time.  On a whim we order the meatball starters, very generic and not very good. The sauce tastes like it came out of a jar and won't order again.  One plus was it was delivered very quickly and the guy was super nice, but I do not believe we will order from them again. If we do it will definitely be something else then what we got last night."}
{"text":"We have ordered from this location and the one on Guadalupe and they have been getting worse each time. Not are first choice anymore!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try the new place, but a bit sad once we had! They have an odd way of seating, once you are assigned a table then you order at the counter, like a deli? The staff didn't know the table layout and you could clearly see that some were irritated. We asked for our wings to come out as the same time as our pizza and fail, they came early... Oh well!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza and their party size is huge, which was perfect for leftovers. Wings were awesome also. I'd recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from this (NEW!) location twice, once at work and once at home.   Last week, my coworkers and I ordered the Park Avenue pizza through Grubhub. It was... ok, but I wouldn't order it again. It wasn't bad-I had 3 pieces!- it just didn't blow me away, which I was hoping for with such an original idea (artichoke hearts, spinach, and chicken). My coworkers all loved it, so this could simply be a matter of personal choice.  I ordered delivery again today, to my home. This time I stuck with my old favorite, the meat lover's, and a new choice, the mac and cheese bites. Oh my god, the mac and cheese bites! I wish I could buy 10 pounds of them, they are ridiculously good. The pizza was the same great quality as the other locations I've visited, I'd give the whole meal overall 5 stars. The driver was awesome too, he complimented my neighborhood, my house, and totally ignored my crazy barking Dachshund.  In a nutshell, I personally would pass on the Park Avenue pizza. Everything else seems to be the same great quality that I've come to expect from Venezia's. You guys will be seeing a lot of me!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my second order from Venezia's. My first order was for a simple cheese and pepperoni pizza. It was delicious, no complaints. Unfortunately same can't be said for this order. I ordered philly cheese steak hero, fries, half order wings, and a pepperoni and green pepper pizza. It took an hour and twenty minutes for it to be delivered, not a huge deal. But this time the food was barely room temperature. The fries tasted stale already, even my dog didn't want to eat them, the pizza tasted a day old and the philly cheese steak barely had any warmth to it, was more a cold cheese steak.  I had high hopes after my first experience and was hoping Venezia's would be my go to, but I don't know if I'll even order from here again."}
{"text":"We always get the chicken pesto pizza and the boneless sweet chili wings delivery it's always fresh and hot.  We love this place!!"}
{"text":"Had Venezia's pizza our last night in Phoenix. While not my favorite pizza it was much better than a chain pizza place. They delivered promptly to the hotel we were staying at and we were happy with the quality of it."}
{"text":"Eat at Venezias. I love pizza. Venezias is my favorite pizza place."}
{"text":"This place is good, but tends to be a bit greasy. I like Barros pizza and wings better. The breadsticks here are just pizza dough baked into stick form and the sauce is not that great..lacked flavor. The pizza sauce also has a strange taste to it. It's okay in a hurry, but I would definitely go to Barros over this."}
{"text":"The pizza & cheese bread was delicious, and the dressing for the Greek salad was perfect. Delivery was fast. I'll definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best places for pizza anywhere. I love this place and if you want to try something different from Pizza Hut or Dominoes or whatever this is a great place that might steal your business from any pizzeria for good. Wings are frickin awesome! I like the spicy bone in stlye from here. Can't go wrong! Staff nice too."}
{"text":"How sweet, couldn't let the ranch mishap keep me away....needed my fix of wings, ordered on line received a call from management saying how sorry they had disappointed me, this is how a business works, they take care of their customers ...Ill keep with them when they say hey we're sorry and we respect you as a consumer..... Thank you"}
{"text":"My order was messed up. They had to remake my order. I was very upset because I had to wait a long time.  I left upset because all they said to me was they were sorry. I got home and realized they forgot a pizza I ordered that made me more upset. So I called to let them know and the manager said yes they forgot my pizza but I was upset and just left so he gave me a full refund and my order  was over 50 dollars. Thanks for making it up to me and my family. I will be back just because of that."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here. Go to joint for our family, probably too much. Their wings are great too. Usually pickup, as delivery is always 45+ mins.  Decided to try sandwich tonight for once, figured buffalo chicken sandwich has to be good. Sure, it's edible. The wing sauce is great. But ONE piece of chicken on each end? You're kidding me right?  Forget the subs, I'll stick to the pizza."}
{"text":"Great spot for pizza, and the price is fantastic. Would definitely recommend to anyone who loves great food. The pastas are fantastic as well."}
{"text":"The food and the staff here are TOP NOTCH.... i bring my family here all the time and we have never been let down!!!!"}
{"text":"We checked this place out for dinner tonight and it was EXCELLENT. We were greeted right as we walked in. Our pizza (especially the crust was delicious), wings, and mac n cheese poppers came out so quickly. The environment is clean. Very cool atmosphere. We'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I thought this place was really good! It took awhile to get our pizza and salads but both were really delicious. Nice thin, crispy crust. I already want to go back!"}
{"text":"Tried Venezia's for the first time with my sons. We all agree that the pizza is very good, but on the pricey side. The atmosphere is good, and the place is clean.  I like to use a fork when eating pizza, but the ridiculous flimsy plastic forks they offer here do not do the job. Pizza requires a metal fork - do you hear that, management? The staff is friendly. They have two large ice machines and a great selection of sodas. Because the New York style pizza is so good, I will probably return, despite the terrible forks."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! I am from NJ and miss good pizza. Came fast and spices were delicious. Facilities very clean. Would come again when I visit AZ"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery at 9pm. Pizza was delivered at 10:30pm. They forgot my salad. This is our first time trying this restaurant and even though they offered a $10 credit to make up for things, this will be our last time. On the bright side, no complaints about the pizza."}
{"text":"We've ordered food for a group of us at work several times from this restaurant. And I've been here three times for carry-out. The restaurant is always clean, employees attentive. Parking can be a challenge at times. The lot is cramped and tiny and easily fills up especially at lunch time.  All in all those of us at work feel the food here is just okay. The ingredients are mediocre. If I could make a comparison for food quality I would compare Venezia's to Pappa John's. It's a few little steps above public school cafeteria food, it will not impress your taste buds but for the price it's a decent value, just don't expect New York deli grade food despite the name.  At work we only go here when we get tired of all the other places we can get delivered. I would suggest you can probably find better in the area of north east Mesa if you look a little online.   While I have no specific complaints about Venezia's it just isn't that great. Everytime we order here we always end up wishing we had ordered elsewhere. I believe this restaurant is designed to appeal to people between the ages of 12-30 years. It's very loud inside."}
{"text":"My husband visited the restaurant for lunch with a coworker and said it was delicious, so we went for dinner tonight.  Since it was just the two of us we opted for a slice and wing combo which was perfect since I am not a fan of too much left over food.   The pizza did not look so great and had barely any cheese on the right side of the slice of pizza. It still tasted great. I ate the parts with no cheese and it was still pretty yummy. Imagine how much better it would be if they covered the ENTIRE pizza with cheese!!  The wings are definitely meh. Don't get them if you like fresh made wings. They are definitely frozen from a bag with generic hot wing sauce. I could have gone to Fry's and got wings out of the freezer and tossed sauce on them. Not good. Luckily the one slice of pizza was so filling I did not need to eat more than one of the wings.    Tiramisu!  I'd say it is restaurant quality, but the last couple of times I tried to order tiramisu at an Italian restaurant the tiramisu was made with cake and frosting. Gross. At Venezia's the tiramisu is made with lady fingers, as it should be, and a delicious marscapone cream filling.  It's ABOVE restaurant quality and is so amazing! It could have used a stronger espresso flavor, but it was so delicious!  I have a great recipe I use (google Chef Dennis tiramisu), but I can't eat an entire tiramisu cake by myself so I rarely make it. I will definitely be back for a slice of this amazing dessert. Yum. Yum. Best part of dinner by far.  Overall, this is a great place 5/5 for delicious PIZZA & tiramisu. Skip the wings, and order dessert. Hopefully they will remember to bring the dessert out for you. They forgot my dessert, but luckily I remembered.  **Went back a week later and got some more yummy pizza. Love getting slices of their big pizza! Helps with portion control instead of ordering an entire pizza."}
{"text":"Starting with the user friendly website and finishing with delicious pies! We are happy to have found our new go to order out pizza.  The sauce was tasty and not too heavy and the toppings were generous. Our only small negative is the pizza was on the side of warm just a bit over room temperature. It was a busy night so hopefully next time the delicious pie will also be hot! There will be a next time for sure!"}
{"text":"So I still think the pizza is among the best I personally have had since Ive been here when it comes to right down the street delicious pizza.   However, they keep stealth raising their prices on wings which is getting old fast.  When I first started ordering from here it was a full order (10 wings) for $8.99.  Then it became $9.99.  And when looking at the menu online tonight its now $10.99.  This is in the span of two years.  We aren't talking inflation here.  What is it going to be another dollar every year for 10 wings?  The wings are just fine and I enjoy them but they are $8.99 good.  This isn't this particular locations fault which is why I wouldn't give them any low stars but rather an annoying corporate decision that is turning me off to coming here.  Keep it up with the pizza greenway location, but seriously what a lame situation with the wings."}
{"text":"Ordered Venezzia's tonight--delivery, it arrived quick and hot.  The pizza is one of the best around in PHX--and this comes from a north Jersey guy.  The pasta dish, baked ziti, I ordered tonight had almost no sauce in it.  First time in at least 7-8 visits I was a bit disappointed.  I chalk it up as a incredibly rare oversight.  Their food has never disappointed in the past.  The salads and the dressings are always GREAT!  Fresh.  The peppercorn vinaigrette is really good.  A must try.  Don't overlook the Tiramisu!  I swear I could eat 3-4 of these per sitting and I'm not a desert guy, but, OMG, these completely rock!  The best part about this place is the staff.  They are over the top gracious for your business and the customer service is through the roof.  They greet you at the door, occasionally stand at the door to open it when you arrive.  They offer up coupons without you asking too!  These guys know customer service and it's great having them in my community.  We've struggled locally with Italian restaurants passing through and the other local on that is still open has NO customer service skills (which is why they lost our business).  Oh, yeah, I forgot: when we come to take-out food my 7-year old is always excited to go with me.  They have a set of bags (cornhole) outside to pass a few minutes by as you wait.  If it's not 100+ degrees out, I'll join him too.  Anyhow, give them a try and you'll be back.  Well done, Venezzia's.  Thank you for bringing some culture and good service to our community.  Chris Birchby ."}
{"text":"I would love to give 5 stars but twice we've gotten take out and had to go back because they forgot to include the au jus for the Italian beef sandwich.   Make sure to check take out orders!!  Otherwise, the food is great!!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite pizza place in the state!  I love love love the low carb pizza bowls! Kudos to the person who thought to put this on the menu. Since I have allergies, I can't eat conventional pizza and I don't always want to pay extra for a gluten-free pizza, so I always order at least one pizza bowl. They are seriously amazing. You get a 2 inch deep aluminum pie plate filled with cheese and your choice of about 50 different pizza toppings, all baked up hot and gooey in the pan. Venezia's salads are also very good but make sure you buy the large, not the small one, because it's a much better value and you get a whole lot more salad. You will seriously have enough salad for the next two days. Service is fantastic here. We've never eaten inside since it's always been too busy on Friday nights, but we order online and get it to go. There's only been one time that our order was messed up when they gave us something we had not ordered. But when I called the shop, they offered to either refund me for the item or to just deliver the item that we had ordered. I call that great service!  When you come here, make sure to try one of the chocolate-covered cannolis. They are absolutely the best I have ever had and I've had them all over the nation. The shells are crispy, and the creamy filling has just the right amount of sweetness. The chocolate ones have a chocolate covered shell and both ends are dipped in mini chocolate chips."}
{"text":"When I moved to the Phoenix area in 2003, I lived right across the street from a Venezia's and it was my absolute favorite spot. I moved away from Tempe into various Phoenix locations in 2005, too far from Venezia's. This lack of Venezia's haunted me for years until they finally opened the Tatum location. I was whole again...  The pizza's are all fantastic and the golden medium wings are a must order every time. The interior(when not having it delivered) is very inviting, a great location. The delivery is always quick. Love having Venezia's in the neighborhood, just writing this review made me want it. Putting in an order now."}
{"text":"Was told the pizza is great so we decided to try.  We ordered a meat lovers pizza and a custom pizza with half pepperoni and half sausage and peppers.  2 adults had one pizza and 2 adults had the other.  The child picked from both.  EVERYONE got food poisoning and super sick! Most awful experience! NEVER AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"Buffalo Chcken on Thursdays  pizza and the bread sticks. Also has gluten free pizza"}
{"text":"I think the company forget about this part of their mini-chain right after it was built. When I walk into the Tempe location, the place is buzzing and more importantly, there are about 15 fresh and hot pizzas in the window. The last two times I attempted to grab a slice at this location, I turned around and walked right out after the disappointing and pathetic pizza display case. Most recently, it was earlier this week and nobody is greeting me or waiting at the register for an order despite only 5 folks hanging out here at lunchtime. The display case (which has room for alot of pies) had two incredibly old and dead looking pies, both were cheese and both only had half their slices remaining. This is at lunchtime. I really like the pizza at this chain, but somebody fell asleep right after this outpost opened. Wake up!"}
{"text":"I love love love the pizza here, it's very nice and family friendly place. The pizza Is great and service is excellent!! They also deliver  I had a slice of cheese pizza and my friend had the phillycheese steak. Really good! Will go again for sure!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great environment and one of the few places you can get pizza AND French fries. The customer service here has been outstanding from my experiences here, which I have been to several Times. Their salads are also amazing!!"}
{"text":"Pretty excited to see another NY Pizza place that can deliver to my house. I'd seen them in Tempe and was hankering for some pie. Especially after drinking a few cold ones on a Friday night.  Ordered a 16\" Supreme and had it delivered to the house. This is one of my standards in reviewing pizza. You get your meat and veggies at the same time and they are all piled up on a nice big slice.  Phoned in our order with great ease. They were very friendly and helpful and let me use my most excellent coupon. Coupons are a great way to get you in the zone and expedite trying out a new place.  Pizza arrived within the time frame that they suggested. It may have even arrived a little bit earlier than what we were expecting. Nice!  The pizza definitely looked better than it tasted. The veggies were sliced very thin and it almost seemed like they could have been prepped for sandwich toppings. The meat toppings were also very thin and did not really pop out and say howdy.  Overall the food did not have much flavor and the sauce was pretty bland as well. We both could not figure out what it was missing. I'm sure it is a basic ingredient in most kitchens?  I know they are new and just opened recently. Give them a try and see what you think. Not the best pizza ever and probably not the worst either. DING DONG!  2.75 STARS"}
{"text":"Called and spoke with Alex to order my pizza best service and extremely nice.   I will recommend everyone to order from there"}
{"text":"I love the slices here and how they can reheat them without drying them out. I recently ordered the lunch combo with a pizza slice and half order of boneless wings. The pizza was good but the wings were AWFUL!  They tasted weird and I was afraid of getting sick so I didn't eat them. The zucchini is awesome though so I'll stick to that."}
{"text":"This is easily one of the best by the slice pizza places in town! In addition they offer a great atmosphere for watching sports and hanging out! The pizza slices are large and thin crust.. new york style. I can barely finish two large slices! They have that perfect combo of chewy and crispy crust! Service is always top notch and quick even when the place is packed! Lately, I've enjoyed getting a slice, half-salad, and drink combo for around $5! Their greek salad is fantastic!"}
{"text":"My one star rating is based on my take-out experiences.  I occasionally get the lunch special which isn't terrible. I have had multiple issues with my take-out order, especially the order I placed tonight.  I ordered one small white pizza and a large cheese, both well done. The white pizza was ready at least ten minutes before the cheese, and was in the warmer. Neither pizza was hot and the white pizza was dry and was lacking in the cheese department. I'm not really sure why it costs $12.00. It's basically just crust. The cheese pizza was better, but still not that hot considering I was waiting ten minutes for it to be ready.  Overall I can't see myself going back. I've already stopped going to my local Barro's and I thought my go-to pizza place would be Venenzia's, but I guess not."}
{"text":"Great food. Lives up to the hype. Great fried chicken. The service is promt and polite."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a number of times since the restaurant opened and have had a love-hate relationship with the place. At it's best, this a very good NY-style pizza parlour with great wings, good ambiance and excellent, friendly service. At it's worst, the pizza is below average, the wings are not edible, the wait is longer than it should be, the place echoes of screaming children, the staff seems careless and the food leaves a certain unsettling feeling afterwards. All in all, the word that most comes to mind is \"inconsistent.\" Not downward trending, not upward trending, but simply highly inconsistent in my opinion... more so than any other restaurant I can think of. That's why I finally just gave up on the place. Don't get me wrong, you can bring your kid's little league team here and they will have a hoot of a time because they won't know the difference, because they can scream all through dinner... and because all pizza tastes good to 1 to 22-year-olds. But if you're looking for a decent bite to eat, I would not recommend rolling the dice."}
{"text":"After the owner Dominic recommending that I give Venezia's another try I finally did. I ordered the same pizza pie.  The so called tomato sauce tasted like watered down V8 juice and the crust once again like a soggy kitchen sponge.  I have visited 8 of the best pizzerias in the US. I'm a foodie and pizza fanatic.    Venezia's is by far the worst pizza I have ever  tasted. The owner Dominic claims they have a great reputation. He's either high on drugs, or is paying people for positive Yelp reviews.  Stay away from this Pizza franchise , or risk great dissapointnent. I won't be giving Venezia's a third try. You can't make garbage pizza taste any better."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. The honey BBQ wings are the best wings I've ever had. Their pizza is fantastic. I order from here all the time and the staff is always super friendly.  This is great pizza!!"}
{"text":"Never did see the comment from management. Thanks for that. But I love this place. My sister had me try it again back around august! Now I am hooked! Love love love! I am here as I type. I come here at least once a week. The pizza is the best! I am having Sausage and onion sub tonight. Everyone needs to try this place out! Watching football too! Priceless!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza I have had since moving to AZ 4 years ago (from NY).  The staff is always super helpful and friendly, the pizza is always PERFECTLY delicious, and if we decided to order delivery, the service is speedy!"}
{"text":"I ordered Venezia's for lunch today and was really happy! My food got here 30 minutes before estimated quoted time online which was great! I had the Italian beef dip sandwich which was super good! It had tons of meat and was packed with hot peppers. The au jus to dip it in was out of this world. Perfect compliment to the sandwich. I also ordered the crumb cake and had to finish it even though I was already full because it was so perfect I couldn't stand the thought of wasting it or saving it for later tbh. I've ordered a pizza here previously because it was rated best pizza in Arizona for 2017. Again, at that time it came before expected and it didn't disappoint. I will definitely be ordering here again and I'm so happy it's just right around the corner for me!"}
{"text":"These guys are rock stars! The service is excellent and the slices are huuuuge! Love the energy here!!"}
{"text":"Pizza bowls (gluten free), really nice staff that stayed after closing hours because I was an idiot and ordered from the wrong store, and the best chocolate cake ever. Seriously. The chocolate cake is evil incarnate. I ate two pieces and would have had to have walked from East Mesa to downtown Phoenix to work off the calories, but it was worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is unreal! The pizza is so good. They serve by the slice or full pizza which is nice for different occasions. The atmosphere is awesome, they have some turf out front with some lawn games. They also have some decent beers, as well. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Oh guys. I just got my home delivery of Venezia's pizza. The Caesar salad was super fresh and crunchy. Absolutely love love love their pizza! And cannoli to die for! My first but definitely not last order."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty pizza and a great price. They have new items to try, but I stick with what I like. The pizza and traditional wings. Great location and expanded parking. Although it's a dirt parking lot, luckily I didn't have to use it in the rain."}
{"text":"Good New York style pizza. I ordered takeout and had the meat lovers pizza and the Park Avenue pizza. Both were very tasty, and you better like garlic if you order the Park Avenue. Big slices. The meat lovers pizza was very good. If you dine in, it is very casual. Wait staff were very courteous and took care of you in quick time."}
{"text":"Greasy Greasy Greasy. Pizza and Calzones were both very greasy to the point that I didn't want to continue eating."}
{"text":"I love this Pizza.  I go here often due to the affordable slice specials and the terrific taste.  I get the Chicken Wings as well which are phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"Venezia must have heard my cry for a location over here. That's probably one of the first things I said after moving to this part of town. \"they should open a venezias'   They opened on Thursday and I probably had tears of joy. This is my favorite delivery, by the slice pizza in AZ.   the crust is thin, the sauce is tangy, the cheese is stretchy, and it pretty much has everything i love about pizza.   I am sad about the delivery charge, it always makes me confused. do i tip? how much do i tip if they already charged me? should i not tip?   whatever, as longs as i have a place to go when i crave pizza"}
{"text":"Pizza was alright but the crust needs to be crispier. I'm from Brooklyn, ny and this is way off of ny style pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza EVER!!!  Excellent time on delivery.  They are busy and put you on hold but it is worth the wait"}
{"text":"Tried just a plain cheese pizza. Texture, sauce, cheese, IT WAS ALL DELICIOUS! Definitely reminds me of east coast pizza from back home. We will be back soon for sure."}
{"text":"I was so excited when this location opened because I had to drive all the way to the east valley! I wish they had a closer location to north Phoenix!  Pizza is always good regardless of dining in or taking out but I've never had delivery since I'm outside the delivery area!  Wings are great!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza and wing spot in the Phoenix area. They have a great slice and half order of wings special that I highly recommend."}
{"text":"We had a very disappointing experience at Venezias on Saturday.  We frequent this location often as it is 2 blocks from our home.  Finding a coupon on the internet, we phoned in an order for a large vegetarian pizza.  When my husband went to pick it up with our coupon on his phone, the acting manager would not honor the  $3 off.  He informed that they do not honor third party coupons.  He elected to let our business go out the door rather than give us $3 off our pizza.   The business aspect of this decison is puzzling to me. Venezia kept the pizza, my husband left empty handed and we will never order from Venezias again. What happened to the pizza? Was it given to the next customer who ordered a vegetarian pizza? Given to employees in the break room? Thrown away?  There are many pizzerias within a 2 mile radius and we discovered a new one."}
{"text":"Can you say \"Best Italian Beef Ever\"?   Seriously, I love the Pizza and Pasta here but tried the Italian Beef for the first time and WOW, it was fantastic.  I choose Provolone as my cheese but they have Mozzarella available also.  The Au Jus puts this sandwich over the top.  Spicy, Tasty and filling.  Make the trip, it's worth it."}
{"text":"First impression:  The pizza under the heat lights looks old/cold and yucky.  Nothing looks appetizing even though I'm really hungry.  The lady behind the counter looks grumpy and distracted.  The Dinning room must be recovering from a rush because it's \"disheveled\".  oops, the refrigerator case by the door just came apart...looks like they need help with maintenance.  Ordering:  OK, the lady behind the counter is actually very nice and helpful and takes our order quickly.  Food:  This is not the same pizza that's on display at the counter!  This stuff is hot and fresh and looks as good as it tastes (take that gross looking pizza out of the case your better off without it).  the Chicken Wings look amazing and taste pretty good.    Try this place.  Don't be scared away at the door."}
{"text":"Off the hook!!!! Fried Zucchinis great, chicken pesto great, cheese pizza the next day cold... Awesome Might need to make a trip out to AZ just for the pizza."}
{"text":"I have ordered pizza from here several times through hub grub and it is the best pizza ever. I love the sauce and I normally get easy sauce but not here. My now go to place for pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza is alright and the staff is always very friendly and pleasant."}
{"text":"One bite everybody knows the rules. Let's start off with the crust. MONEY. Awesome crust. Nice, light and has a good crunch. Fresh mutz wasn't the best I've tasted. Wasn't as milky as I hoped but not bad. Mutz to sauce ratio wasn't bad but not ideal. One bite everybody knows the rules. This piece will get a 6.8. Def not bad."}
{"text":"I love their pizza. It's the perfect crust and awesome size. The pepperoni fixes my greasy ranchy craving or I get the chicken pesto. BOMB ranch. They have all the fixings you need including oregano and garlic (powder I'm guessing). They serve Pepsi products which I love the most with pizza. I was going so often at one point a few of the workers memorized my name. Super great price point. I usually spend $5-6. It's usually quick even when it's busy! I got delivery once and it was quick and my pizza was fresh. Highly highly recommend this pizza. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Drove past this place a few weeks ago and took a mental note. Had a taste for pizza tonight and decided to order. BEST decision EVERRR!!!! The pizza was great. I like that it wasn't very heavy in my stomach if that makes sense (lol). I was also able to try some wings. I decided to order golden medium bone in and they were just as amazing. There was just one minor issue I had, the pizza slices could have been cut better but that is such a minor detail, it didn't affect the taste or quality. The staff was great, everyone was friendly. I was able to be helped promptly. I have found my new go to place for pizza. I can't wait to try other menu items and even dessert next time"}
{"text":"Loved the wings! Especially the Gold Medium, which I had never had before. Kind of a combination of sweet mustard and buffalo sauce. Unique flavour that I will be craving."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! For the best pizza in town this is it for sure.  Great patio (dog friendly) and cheap specials. Take out, delivery an dine in."}
{"text":"I used to live in New York City and this pizza tastes exactly the same as some of my favorite spots back there. Fold it up and go to town. I'm super glad I can get this style and quality of pizza in Mesa."}
{"text":"I recently tried the \"low carb\" pizza bowl here, which is basically just a pizza without the crust. It's really good! I'm not convinced its not also horrible for you, as it's loaded with cheese and grease etc (but no complaints!). It was packed with toppings and melty cheesy goodness and I felt as if I were really eating a pizza. We ordered delivery which was very quick and all items were hot when they arrived. I'm not sure I would tout this as being a healthy in any way, but if you are watching your carb intake I would recommend trying this out when the hankering for pizza hits."}
{"text":"The Short: Pizza so good that it graces God with its existence. I think they sell other stuff but I'm to busy worshipping the slice from my last visit to find out.   The Pro: - Everything. Just ... EVERYTHING (almost).  - You could tell me their food is made out of people. I'd still eat it.  The Con: - Some of their younger employees have bad attitudes and an allergic reaction to work."}
{"text":"I drive all the way from Goodyear to have this amazing pizza! There is no where in the valley that has that great thin crust taste. I ordered a big Party Pizza once and was great for left overs tasted just as fresh. The Manager was very friendly my first time I visited this place and He couldn't believe i drove almost over 50 miles to try this pizza. I was told by a friend to try the pizza and just fell in love."}
{"text":"Honestly this is my favorite pizza in the valley but their delivery SUCKS.  Don't order this if you're already hungry.  Order it when you order Chinese food and by the time you're hungry AGAIN your pizza might arrive.  This is the second time I've given them a chance for delivery and after an hour and 20 minutes I had to call them each time.  I haven't gotten my pizza yet this time so I can't give a full time estimate but officially so far it's been an hour and a half."}
{"text":"Love the pizza from here- great place to go with a large group.  Anti pasta salad very good too.  Our go to place for pizza"}
{"text":"Very good Pizza, you can even buy it by the slice. Friendly staff clean and fresh dinning area"}
{"text":"one word GOLD~:) Love the Party Pizza~Fabulous TASTE~Great Value and especially love they are so nearby. Used to have to go to The East Mesa location ...now I can literally walk over :)"}
{"text":"OMG yes! 2 huge slices of pizza and a drink for $6.25!?!? Run, don't walk, and bring the kids. Add their fresh garden salad and you'll be set. Delicious, fresh, friendly staff, and no dishes to wash!"}
{"text":"THE BEST PIZZA IN ARIZONA!!!!! Ordered the 24' pizza for my family and it was sooo good! Prices were right and will be returning for pizza nights!:)"}
{"text":"I am thrilled they are in the neighborhood and have had delivery once. Wish I could order slices for delivery because we wanted to try sandwiches and entrees but had one person who wanted pizza. I expected so much more based on the hype and I will give it another try.   Plusses:  delivery guy was friendly and made sure the order was correct. He was really happy to be of service. Love that attitude. They got all the sides we asked for like extra ranch and marinara.  Often that is overlooked at other places. There were many choices off the menu including desserts and appetizers.   The pizza was pretty ordinary and I was not expecting that. I was really hoping for some authentic NY pizza and not some corporate fast food. The salad was fine but nothing special-just lettuce and a few items including box croutons. My son got the sausage sandwich and really liked it. He said he would definitely order it again.   My hope is to try it again and update my review to reflect the changes."}
{"text":"This Location SUCKS, very disappointed with my dine in today, to start off they don't have many pizza selections, and the few they had looked old and dried out, NOTHING like the Tempe location, where the pizza is coming out fresh and hot constantly, I asked the gentleman if they had chicken pesto, he rudely answers me no, just what's here, I've never been told that at the Tempe location, after seeing all the dried old pizza there, I decided to just stick with a basic Italian sub, there are a lot of workers and there all clowning around being loud in the kitchen, that's something u would never see at the Tempe location, maybe because there so busy and don't have time to, the guy throwing the pizza dough to stretch it uses NO gloves, with his bare hands, that's disgusting, I will not be going back to this location, Tempe location is the BEST!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my fourth time in the past two months of visiting Venezia's. I've tried their pizza by the slice and I'm having their Italian sub for the third time. Delicious good quality, good price and my generation music playing in the background. Ha ha!    Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Was given the menu by the front desk of the hotel we were staying at after a very long trip.   Just wanted food and sleep.    While ordering,  the name looked familiar but couldn't place it.   When we got the pizzas,  there it was on the box...\"As seen on Breaking Bad\".  Apparently they've expanded to Phoenix from Albuquerque.   That being said,  this pizza is phenomenal.   I'm not exaggerating even a little bit.  I don't typically give 5 stars but this place earned every one of them.  I've lived east coast.   I know New York and Jersey pizza.    We ordered pepperoni and mushroom on one and pineapple and ham on the other.   The pepperoni and mushroom was the best pizza I've ever had.   Not kidding.  The crust had perfect crunch and perfect flavor.   The sauce tasted just right,  perfect acidity,  Italian herb zest,  and the perfect amount to top the crust.   Toppings were spot on fresh.   Pepperoni had the right \"drip down your arm\" amount of grease with an amazing taste.   Mushrooms absorbed all that juice and all that Italian flavor just like fresh mushrooms should.   The Hawaiian was pretty darned good too.  So we head up north for a few days and come back to Phoenix.  Yes, we get it again.   Yes, it's just as good as the first time.  Yes, it's still the best pizza I've ever had.  I will beg these guys to expand into Colorado.   It is that fricking good.   Do yourselves a favor when in Phoenix. ... GET THIS PIZZA!!!!!! It is that good."}
{"text":"Used to live in the neighborhood,  this place was so great,  I missed it after we moved. It's been a few years since we stopped in, it happened to be on the way home and they have a special for what XL 1 topping for 23.99. I have teenage boys, this is a good deal! Got there and they were pulling them hot out of the oven. Girl up front barely made eye contact with me, didn't even smile, maybe it was a rough night, I didn't judge her, I've done that job. Got the Pizzas home, barely any cheese on them, and one half of them was cheese alone, it was hard to tell. Half of one was mushrooms, it literally looked like they took half a mushroom, that's being generous, and sliced the smallest pieces ever and spread it around an entire half. The other Pizza was half bo half pepp,  ingredient ratio was decent,  still lacking in cheese. Over all the pizza itself was very lacking in flavor, wasn't appealing to the eye, super skimpy on the ingredients. I had 2 pieces of the mushroom and threw the rest away. The quality seems to be so much more subpar than it used to be. We won't be coming back anymore,  not worth the 12.50 per Pizza I spent. The 1 star is because it was hot.  I won't spend money on food that is just eh."}
{"text":"Finally some REAL pizza!! I have been all over the valley and so far this is the best by far.. stay away from places like GENOS they are horrible compared to here...love their crust and the taste of the cheese, it has the perfect balance of salty and savory..."}
{"text":"After being away from Brooklyn, NY for almost 9 years I thought I would never eat good pizza again!!  When I ate their pizza, especially the party slice,  I knew my search was over!  I found it!  Yummy, yummy"}
{"text":"My new pizza place! Since I moved from Philadelphia I haven't been able to find good pizza but here it is! And the service is impeccable ."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery twice. First order was a Hawaiian pizza, a calzone with meatballs, mild wings, and mozzarella sticks.   The pizza was great, no complaints. The pizza was well seasoned, bold sauce, a solid amount of toppings, and a nice crust- not too chewy and just the right amount of crunch.  Wings were good, too- just enough spice for me, tender, and plenty of sauce. The calzone was ok, the meatballs didn't have much seasoning so it was a bit bland.  The filling was otherwise tasty, with the right amounts of mozzarella and ricotta- they didn't overpower or ruin the texture of the calzone crust. The marinara was great and kind of made the calzone, it wouldn't have been flavorful without sauce. The mozzarella sticks were cold and soggy so it's hard to say if they would have been good :-/  Second delivery took place a few weeks later, mainly because my boyfriend is a die hard fan of their mesa location. We ordered another Hawaiian pizza, a Bianco pizza, and garlic bread with cheese.   The Hawaiian pizza this time was off-  it tasted burnt with a pretty tough crust.  The Bianco was flavorful, but texture wise it was a lot chewier and seemed kind of dry. The garlic bread with cheese was tasty- garlicky, buttery, and a full layer of baked on cheese.  I'm told they're normally great, but I think because it's a new location they may be working out some consistency issues.    Along with the food, I hope their delivery efficiency improves- both deliveries took a little over an hour and I think it's why we got cold food."}
{"text":"Great pizza, super wings, great deals, staff is very helping & nice!  Best pizza in Mesa."}
{"text":"The pizza is ptetty darn good here! And i love the medium gold wings they're my fave. They are kind of pricy, but id choose Venezias over Barros if that says anything.... they have slice combos, but i always get the wing and salad combo."}
{"text":"We drove here from Surprise to experience the Keto friendly, low carb bowls. Yum! I had  the Diavolo Pizza Bowl and my husband had  he Combo Pizza Bowl. We also shared an order of medium wings.   I wanted the Diavolo bowl to be spicier, but it was still quite good. We had plenty of food and ended up both taking home half plus a few wings we didn't manage to finish.  I wish the bowls weren't only available for lunch. And.... please open a location is Surprise or at least somewhere in the West Valley. :)"}
{"text":"I kept hearing it was good. And, I finally tried it, and it was really good. I'm from Chicago and am very picky when it comes to pizza. This is New York style, and that's fine by me, because it's great. Good quality ingredients, with good portions. The one I had was cut in squares, and I prefer it that way."}
{"text":"Came into town for a bachelor party and needed some quick food for that night. Not a ton of options near us so wasn't expecting much but the pizza was pretty good. I would order again."}
{"text":"the only good thing about this location....shyra!!!! she was sweet and a great employee. :)  the pizza got me and my son sick!!!!! definitely not going back to this location!!!!!  very disappointed!!!!! :( :( :("}
{"text":"I was away on business and unfamiliar with the area. Placed a delivery order to my hotel through the Yelp app. The order was correct, and delivery was prompt. Pizza was good - I had no complaints. The chocolate cake was a bit over-chocolately for my taste, with chocolate frosting, but I assume choc-o-holics would love it. It had good flavor, just wasn't my jam. I had no complaints whatsoever, and would call them again if I were ever in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in Phoenix. Ever since I found this restaurant, I haven't ordered pizza out from any where else. You can really taste the quality difference in everything they make. Everyone who I know who has tried Venezia's agrees with me too! The staff is also extremely kind & personable. Whenever I go in, I find myself leaving happier than I did before."}
{"text":"Very disappointing .  I have been coming to this location  since it opened  and have enjoyed it very much. The food was  always  fresh and  delicious .  Until today .  Had to wait 20 minutes for a slice of cheese   pizza.   Was told it would be   a  fresh   pie. But when the pizza came it was cold and old. When I expressed  my disappointment he lied to me and said the pizza was fresh. I have been eating  pizza all my life,and the pizza was   old. VERY DISAPPOINTING"}
{"text":"There's on employee here in particular that was just absolutely spectacular!!! His name is Kevin and he was very kind, patient and understanding when we called in our delivery order (we are not from Arizona so we had no idea what we were doing). He went above and beyond normal customer service  to make sure our order was just right and we were 100% satisfied with!!! So thank you Kevin!!!"}
{"text":"The food is always good, pizza's, Italian fries and the wings  are yummy. The part where the owner should work on is consistency in service, maybe a stronger manager would be not a bad idea. We will still use this place for our pizza orders.  C M"}
{"text":"Not NY style pizza. Born and raised in NY I decided to try this spot.   First, when I walked in I seen they had a put through machine like all of the other \"fake\" pizza places. No throwing of the dough, no ovens to cook!   Pizza was ehhhh ok at best, Peter Piper would give this place a run for its money.   Wings were good, baked ziti was not great.   If you are from NY, you would be disappointed...."}
{"text":"I have been a big Venezia's fan since discovering their Tempe location a few years ago. Was super excited when I heard they opened a store in North Phoenix, as I'm in the area often visiting my parents. Took my dad, who is a New York native, and he gave their pizza a big thumbs up! My favorite combination is pepperoni and green chile, a must try. They also have great wings and salads, ingredients are consistently fresh. Best tiramisu I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I love their pizza. They are reasonably priced and large size slices. I come from west size of valley to eat here."}
{"text":"The pizza was really good! The only thing I didn't like was that you can only get the specialty toppings on the single slices on the designated day of the week for that topping. Other than this it was really good! I will def go back soon."}
{"text":"They have a special which is 2 huge slices and a drink for $6.95.  I also think you can sub the soda for a beer if you want might be a few bucks extra (not sure).  I tried this place the other night, and I was pretty impressed.  In my opinion this is the classic NYC utility slice.  It's a neighborhood place you come to eat and have a few beers, or bring the kids here after a soccer game.  Welcome to the neighborhood!  I think they'll definitely be here a while."}
{"text":"The pizza only had toppings on @ 2/3 of it. Disappointing.  Even worse was I ordered through Yelp app....I only got half my order today and the driver said it would take 30min to bring my sofa and Caesar salad....I only live 2 miles away."}
{"text":"I probably order from here 3-5 times a month between work and home. EVERY SINGLE TIME... It's AMAZING.  Everyone is polite and the order usually arrives before the time shown in my email confirmation. When you get tired of pretending the Papa John's, Pizza Hut and Domino's \"Know Pizza\" and want a GOOD pizza or anything else for that matter, get some Venezia's. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Possibly one of the worst tasting pieces of Pizza that I have ever had. It was like eating a piece of cardboard. Feel like eating thin, thin, thin cardboard Pizza with minimal cheese and toppings on it than this is the place for you to go. My family grew up in Chicago and this would never fly in Chicago absolutely terrible we will never come back again. Rude wait staff definitely not a warm friendly place to have dinner at sorry!!!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Friendly and fast. Got my specific order correct and large portions with very fair pricing. Huge large meat lovers is slightly salty but the cured meats explain this so by their fault. $16 for a large which is very fair. Spaghetti marinara  was actually flavorful and they had no problem with sauce on the side. Will be ordering again for sure. I'm from NYC and will give this place a thumbs up for sure!"}
{"text":"Way to go Venezia's!  I really like this new location - tons of roomy sitting areas, fun outdoor space and easy access from Tatum. I got the Margherita pizza and it was bomb! Great ingredients, well cooked throughout, timely and gracious service. The slices are a perfect meal size for lunch.  I also had an order of their BBQ Hot wings, boneless, and they were wonderful as well. I usually love very spicy wings, and these were right on point, just hot enough.  I really enjoy food from here, but also the environment Venezia's provides. It's fun, has quality food and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Awesome daily lunch specials! Fast service and a clean restaurant. Sometime the wings are a bit off i.e. flavoring, count, size, etc. but overall great food."}
{"text":"Ordered two pizzas from there last week. We ordered Italian Stallion and a plain cheese. They were OK , but not great. I am not sure why they say they are New York Style....not even close. The pizzas are made on a conveyor belt passing through the oven....just like Costco. I like Costco pizza, but neither is NY style which has a crispy crust."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place. I eat at this one and Ray and Cooper multiple times a week. You download and app called stampt and you get a free slice,  and a free slice later on with a purchase of an xl drink.   10 stamps gets you 2 free slices. It's quick and they have plenty of lunch specials. Make sure you get the sweet chili wings if you like wings. Boneless or bone in.   If you go in the back they have pictures on the wall of everyone that has completed the pizza challenge. (I think it's like 24 inches) 2 people have to eat this behemoth in an hour. Once done you get your picture on the wall and a tshirt."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery with a lot of friends in North Scottsdale and the delivery was way earlier than expected (they came 15 minutes earlier than they said on the phone), which is always good to get a delivery before the expectations.   My friends and I ordered three pizzas. We ordered were Hawaiian (pineapple on a pizza always tastes good), Margherita, and pepperoni.   My favorite was the Hawaiian which has extra cheese, Canadian Bacon and Pineapple.  The Margherita was really good too, which had mozzarella Ocol one, their homemade sauce (tastes sweet and delicious) and basil.  The pepperoni was really that had extra cheese with the slices of pepperoni, a classic order.  I believe for the three pizzas, the price was around $50 and the group of eight people enjoyed it and finished all the pizza with everyone full.   Would definitely try more pizza, pizza bowls, salad, calzones."}
{"text":"If I was rating the food only, this place would get more stars. Unfortunately, they hire very young staff who treat customers rudely. I put up with it until now, but they finally lost my business."}
{"text":"This is the most amazing pizza I have ever had!!! I love pizza, and have found some not so great places around town.. this is by FAR the best one.. I love the Italian stallion pizza. It's spicy and still keeps with a traditional pizza flavor.. I highly recommend this place!!! Plus the staff is always nice and on point."}
{"text":"Our first time visiting, the food was amazing! Meat lovers slice and garlic bread. The pizza sauce was fresh and they put plenty of toppings on. Great staff too! Check this place out!"}
{"text":"I want to like it but just spent $50+ on pizza that was at best, very average. Luckily it was for a kids b-day party, they don't know any better. Crust was soft / borderline undercooked, taste wasn't memorable. Overall after two visits, it's time to find good / memorable pizza."}
{"text":"First time consumer, ordering via website thru Yelp, order super easy. Flavor was very good, ordered a pizza with favorite items, pepperoni, sausage, bell peper onions, feta, jalapeños, blk olives, shrooms.  Hot wings all drummets, spinach salad, veggie tray, meal was fantastic veggies crisp, Pizza was hot n spicy.  I will order again.  Thank you Team for feeding my family!  Oh payment method was easy on line with tip.  Very sweet stuff thanks again."}
{"text":"No, just no. Honestly I prefer hungry Howie's or even dominos. But if I am going to a more uppercrust - pardon the pun - pizza place I would definitely go to Crust on Tatum. Not the best customer service and the pizza itself is just horrible:( very disappointed I was really hoping to like this place"}
{"text":"The Best!   Visited them last night after the worst service and food at the restaurant next door.   Was starving and picked up an extra large pizza that was mouth watering good.  GREAT SERVICE too!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"There are no words to explain how GREAT this pizza is. My boyfriend and I are from New Jersey and are used to a certain standard of pizza. We moved here 6 months ago and have been on the hunt for good pizza. Time and time again we've been let down but our search ended TODAY. We are so so excited to have found Venezia's Pizzeria. It brings a bit of home here to AZ. Large slices and good prices. Can't beat that. We can't wait to come back. THANK YOU."}
{"text":"About what you'd expect from your average strip mall neighborhood pizza joint.  The pizza equivalent of \"Joe Smith 123 Anystreet, USA\" if you will."}
{"text":"This used to be our go to pizza place (3 or more times a month), but lately the standards have dropped.  The pizzas ordered \"well done\" are soggy messes. The last one we ordered was so bad that it balled up in our hands and the grease soaked through the box.  After having to many deliveries like this and disappointing dine in experiences, we called to complain. The manager supervised the cook on our pizza and delivered it to us.  Huzzah!  Pizza was cooked properly! I added two stars for the prompt fix the on duty manager did. I am a bit scared to order again, as the last five or so experiences were awful. I'll revisit the review if things get straightened out. They really need to train their people better."}
{"text":"Worst pizza and service I have ever had at this dive.  25minute wait for 2 pieces of the worst and coldest pizza I have ever had. PIZZA was dry and old and I could not tell where the pizza ended and the cardboard started.  Stay away!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best!! Great atmosphere, TVs and hot waitresses! I don't feel the need to say anymore this review it's about as straight and direct to the point as I can get."}
{"text":"This place was 40 minutes late, so the pizza was cold. The pizza was okay at best and the wings were not that great (taste was okay).   Doubt we will order again unless they change. We even had to call the see when the pizza would arrive."}
{"text":"1st time here. We tried several different slices and the wings. All were very good! Try this place out for great pizza."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Food is great (I really like the pizza, salad and Italian sub. We also buy their Italian dressing for our home.), people are super nice and we love the relaxed environment. It has a small town feel in a big city. My husband likes how the guys working always remember his name. Perfect for date night or family night. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The customer service was pretty spotty when we went to pick up our takeout order. The girl working the counter seemed as though we were bothering her by picking up our food. Pizza wise, it just wasn't good.  We got a simple pepperoni pizza.  I really can't describe it, it just wasn't very good.  Still have yet to find a good pizza place here in AZ"}
{"text":"First time I have ever gotten take out from Venezia's. I usually grab the lunch special a slice and a salad or wings, which is alway pretty good. Was disappointed in the food on the pick up.. Was on Fathers Day and they were swamped, so I will give them somewhat of a pass. But pizza was flavorless, dry and not very good. Upon arrival they forgot one pizza on my order and had to wait 20 minutes. Don't recommend take out, the big slice you get while eating in seems so much better. Has flavor and juicy, with a crispy bottom."}
{"text":"Delicious food, super fast and cheap! Warm atmosphere and great place for a quick lunch or dinner or with the whole family. My only complaint is that their pizza would be so much better with Coke products."}
{"text":"I was out and about driving around and came across this Diamond in the desert for pizza! I had the slice and wings and let me tell ya, one of a kind and the price was incredible! I can't say enough about this place. Service was amazing and the restaurant was immaculate! If you're in the area, I highly recommend this pizza restaurant and will come back numerous times for that delicious pie!"}
{"text":"Pizza was real good best in Phoenix area. Ordered the party box and Xlarge it was good for about 15 people. They were nice and professional they helped put pizza in my car! Great service. Everyone at the pool commented about how good it was also :) THANK YOU"}
{"text":"The pizza isn't the greatest I have ever had, but it was pretty good for the Valley. We got a whole XL pizza with meatballs for like $16. It was not a bad deal. I would certainly go back to Venezia's. If you are a New Yorker, you will be disappointed, though. Also, the pizza place from Breaking Bad (the one that made the pizza Walt threw on the roof)."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and wings! Living out in Los Sendas it's hard to find quality food delivered out here.  Just last night our delivery driver didn't catch his name,  but he was tall, a beard, backwards hat, with a warm smile was very prompt kind and accurate our order.  5 out of 5"}
{"text":"This place has the best customer service. The staff remembers your name. Nichole is always smiling and ready to take my order. The slices are hot and there are some great craft beers to choose from."}
{"text":"My wife and I love Venezia's!  Our favorite pizza place, thin NY style pizza.  They sell giant party size pizzas which are great when we have people over."}
{"text":"We went here on the high praises of my 2 friends as they have frequented the Tempe location and have raved about the food, they were just there (Tempe) 2 weeks ago and as usual, loved it!  We went here (Tatum Blvd.) since it is about 10 minutes from our homes on the 4th of July around 6pm.  NOT busy so figured we'd get great service and have no issues - WRONG!!!  Placed our orders...Caprese Salad, 2 slices of Cheese Pizza and a Pepperoni Calzone.  We poured our drinks, sat down and within 2 minutes, the Caprese Salad arrived.  We all sat and said, so I guess we don't ALL get to eat together since nothing else was delivered to our table???  Clearly this WAS NOT an appetizer when 3 people order 3 things, not like we were going to be sharing our orders!!!  Note, I know you order at the counter then seat yourself but really, who goes to a place like this to eat-in and wants all the meals to randomly arrive at different times???  Strike 1...  Next out, the calzone, in less than 5 minutes.  Now, anyone who has ever cooked a calzone will tell you, it takes longer than 5 minutes to cook a calzone.  So now 2 out of 3 of us had our meals.  If anything, the 2 slices of Cheese Pizza should have arrived well before the calzone.  We all sat for about another 3 minutes waiting and hoping the slices would soon follow but nothing... ... ...  Strike 2... ...  One of our party approached the front counter where another patron was struggling with his order with the employee who was clearly having issues getting it straight.  He inquired about the last item on our order and got the deer in the headlights look and the response of oops, guess we forgot about the pizza slices.   Strike 3 ... ... ... In about 3 more minutes, it arrived, NOW we could all 3 being our meals.  The Caprese Salad was good.  Hard to screw this up.  The cheese in my opinion was not very tasty and fell short.  No pepper or spices so bland all around.    The other person who ordered the 2 cheese pizza slices picked one up and it fell over.  The dough was limp and lifeless.  He took and bite and said, wow this is nothing like the pizza in Tempe, fell way short of the high anticipation he had.  He managed to slowly chew down 1 slice and offered the 2nd for us to have, we both declined.  Strike 4 ... ... ... ...  Last but not least, the 5 minutes or less Calzone.  Cut into it on one end and it was dough, nothing but dough.  Then attempted to cut more off (with plastic fork and knife - really?!?!?!?  Get some stainless steel utensils in here for Gods Sake - this is Italian food, you shouldn't eat Italian food with plastic picnic utensils).  After repeatedly sawing through the dough, finally I could cut off a piece.  Took a bite and well, my response was the same as my other table guest about the taste of his pizza, it fell short, waaaaaaay short!  I opened up the calzone to see pepperoni, mozzarella cheese but visually and taste wise, no ricotta or parmesean cheese - NONE!!!  There were no spices, no oregano, no garlic, nothing.  Strike 5 ... ... ... ... ...  I chewed through about 3 pieces and could not figure out why the darn thing was so difficult to saw through.  I opened up the top and looked and the inside and guess what - the dough on top was RAW, gooey, uncooked and raw!!!.  Based on the time it took to be delivered to the table after the order was placed, I wish I had opened this up first.   Strike 6 ... ... ... ... ... ...   My guest took the plate up to the front, showed it to one of the girls and said we don't want our money back but you need to get this fixed.  She gasped when he showed her to raw dough.    We never saw an adult or responsible looking person in the place so I am sure our issue will not be shared with anyone of authority or management by the employees working that night.  Needless to say, our high hopes vanished and we will not ever be back to the Tatum location ... ever!!!  Last and final STRIKE AND YOUR OUT ... ... ... ... ... ... ..."}
{"text":"Been searching for the best NY pizza for 30 years now, and this place is one of the best ones I found. BUT.. to get the full NY experience, make sure you get a slice that's fresh out of the oven, preferably just cheese (or pepperoni If you long for the grease dripping down your arm).  The other great thing about this place - for those on low-carb or ketogenic diets - they make pizza bowls! No crust, just toppings, sauce & cheese, and a good size portion for leftovers."}
{"text":"Ambiance: yuck.  Food: yuck.  Only gave Two stars because there was some effort at customer service."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try Venezia's tonight, since we just saw a promotion on ABC 15. We've never heard of it before. Got the address from their web-site, and my GPS says no such address exists! Apparently, this particular Venezia's has only been open for about two months. We found the place easily enough. It's a large building, hard to miss, really.   They have four flat screen monitors mounted in portrait mode to display all of their menu items and prices. Its the nicest menu-system of any restaurant (chain or otherwise.)  You walk up to the counter, place your order and pay for it. You'll get your drink cups and a number placard. Seat yourself. As I previously mentioned, this place is huge! (The restrooms, not so much. One person (of each gender) at a time with a locked door. So, the wait can be a while (depending on who's in there and why...)  There are two ice machines and beside each one is a tiny touch-screen Pepsi-products dispenser. Apparently, this is Pepsi's way of responding to those giant all-in-one touch-screen Coca-Cola machines? I touch the screen to get started, select Pepsi and then it wants to know what flavor i want to add. Four are listed - cherry, lemon, etc... I ignore those and push the dispense button. I must say, I am not a fan of these machines. All I want is a regular soda. Not diet, not rootbeer, not flavored! I imagine at least 75% who use these machines select 'Pepsi' or 'Coke', so why not have a button that takes you to the most common item selected instead and a different button to go through all those menu's?    The food was brought to our table. We started with an order of 'medium' chicken wings, and they really good. The sauce was closer to HOT than MEDIUM, so next time I'll order mild. They're served with some celery sticks and carrots and, of course, ranch dressing.   About half-way through the wings, they delivered our pizza to our table. A small pepperoni and mushroom pizza. They asked if there was anything we would like removed from the table (used plates, trash, etc...). That's a nice touch!  They claim the pizza is \"New York Style\" but New York is a big place and there are many different styles of pizza there. Most \"New York Style\" restaurants I dine at are nothing at all like restaurants in New York! But, I'm pleased to say Venezia's is truly New York style.  I don't like how they put the toppings under the cheese. Doesn't that make them underlings instead of toppings? TOPpings. TOP. T-O-P.... okay, I think I made my point on this one. The pepperoni doesn't get crispy because it's hidden beneath the cheese. It's hard to tell which pizza is which if you order different toppings on each one. Good luck with that treasure hunt!  That OCD aside, the crust was thin (not cracker-like, just thin) and the sauce was more like a marinara. I have a hard time describing the sauce. It's different and I can't decide if it's disgusting or my new favorite thing. This is a tough one. I'll have to process this by eating a few more pizzas and I'll follow-up here once I decide.  The edges of the crust and the top of the cheese were brown and had these little dark-brown areas showing if it cooked any longer, it'd be burned. That's how you cook a pizza! Everyone talks about the cheese, sauce, crust, atmosphere of the restaurant, prices, service, and NO ONE EVER talks about the art of knowing how to properly cook one. Trust me, it's a lost art, but its alive and well at Venezia's!  With a salad, our total was $29.00. I think it was fair for the price. I think we'll have to go back and try it again. Servers were all very friendly. The place is clean and it doesn't get too loud. Food came out within 10 minutes of ordering it - that's impressive! I just don't know about that pizza sauce, though..."}
{"text":"Sunday special large 1 topping pizza wings and 2 litter soda for $20. Good customer service. Good good. Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"We decided to venture outside our normal pizza go-to place and try Venezia's.  We weren't wowed, but it was good. We had our order delivered ($2.75 upcharge, not including tip) and it was delivered hot and on time by a very pleasant young woman. We started with an antipasto salad.  It has the usual meat toppings and a few veggies (black olives featuring very prominently) and I really like the chopped pepperoncini.  Parmesan Peppercorn dressing was very tasty if you like a creamy dressing. Next came the medium wings (1/2 order was 5 wings).  Hubby said they were good, but spicier than he liked.  I'm not a wing person, so I have no opinion. Then, the highlight: the 16\" combo.  It was hot, with lots of toppings (very thinly sliced) and a medium-thick crust, but I didn't get a lot of the rich flavor I've come to expect.  We might try it again in future, but for now, it's back to our favorite place."}
{"text":"So I totally pulled a space cadet move on the online ordering system and ended up with $50 of food for me and my husband but I sent the extra back with the driver and they refunded my money.  GREAT customer service.  The pizza is amazing but everybody already knows that!"}
{"text":"I'm new in the neighborhood and my friend turned me on to this place... she raved about how she and her hubby LOVE Venezio's (I know, its Venezia's... with an \"A\")!    So me and my little one went late one night, exhausted from a long day but starving!  We each ordered the slice and wing combo.  YUMMY pizza, reminds me of New York Giant Pizza from back home (San Diego) when I was growing up.  Yummy sauce, not too much cheese and cooked well.  We both loved it.  The wings were also delicious... I had mild and he had bbq.  We have been back 3 times since then!  Its GOOOD!"}
{"text":"Their lunch special is dynamite!  Their pizza slices are huge!  Whenever we are in the area this place is a must to stop in for some delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Love this place. Pizza crust is chewy and the slices are huge. They also have great Italian subs with Italian dressing that is made in house. It's worth a try!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and good pricing...we will definitely be getting more pizza from this place!  Next time may even try the wings."}
{"text":"What a deightful surprise! Really good pizza. I loved the sauce as it is one of the few in town that tastes freshly made. The crust was great and cooked to perfection. The wings were excellent (hot sauce was HOT) and the salad was fresh, plenty of meat with excellent Italian dressing. Nice staff, tv's if you want to watch. CLEAN! Will definately be eating here frequently."}
{"text":"Well it's been 3 days of misery after severe food poisoning from having the protein bowl but I am finally getting strength back. Be very cautious when ordering from this place. I had pepperoni and Canadian bacon with bell peppers and black olives. It was not fun at 4am. I would go talk to the manager but I don't think I can step foot in this place without running to the bathroom to vomit from the scent of the food. I just know I will NEVER order from here again. It only take one time to ruin it for a person and this was it for me. But on a side note the delivery was very speedy. From me to you, if you want diarrhea and vomiting and most of the time at the same time then order from here but trust me you'll be in for a running pun intended."}
{"text":"Placed an order for delivery and it was prompt and most importantly, Hot! Order was for medium sauces hot wings and a medium pizza with pepperoni and black olive. The pizza was delicious thought the slices could have been cut smaller and I wish I ordered the small... it was huge. The sauce was delicious,pepperoni was crispy and most important, the crust was chewy . I only had one of the wings but they were good though a slight bit more sauce would have been nice. Only gave four star bc it gives me the opportunity to order again give it another try... which is exactly what we will do!"}
{"text":"Such delicious Margherita pizza and salads!  Tonight was the first visit here for my wife and I and now our interest in other pizza places is gone!  Our daughter told us about this place for pizza by the slice and said it was by far her favorite pizza in Mesa.  We will definitely be back...again and again!"}
{"text":"Great sauce! Ordered through Uber Eats and it was great! Really good quality meats and fresh salad."}
{"text":"Tonight we decided on pizza. It's a night that never goes wrong, everyone is satisfied and it's quick and easy on your wallet.   It had been a busy week so we all decided to call in our order for pick up and bring it home to watch the World Series. We ordered a large Greek salad and an extra large vegetarian pizza with sausage. Ha, sounds a little contradictory (we just really enjoy the veggies but like to have a meat). This was about 5:30pm - they told ya our pizza and salad would be ready to rock by 6. Perfect.   We drive over for 6ish. We check in and receive $3 off our pizza - awesome!! Our food's prepared for us and already bagged and ready. The transaction is smooth: there is no wait, we pay, are given the discount and off we head home. Mmmm. The smell of pizza in the car...  When we arrive home, our smiles turn quickly upside down. They gave us the wrong order! Our pizza is correct but we have a calzone instead of our Greek salad! Damn.   My company calls them a little ticked that he can't eat his salad first as he always does. After a few words and a little convincing (or maybe more telling, ha), Venezia agrees to drive the salad on over. I think, great! Error is not what bothers me... it's when people don't rectify the problem that effects my review.   When the employee arrives about 10 minutes later he appears emotionless. There was no apology or friendly tone - in fact I don't think he said anything at all! He just stuck his arm out and handed over the salad.   I'm disappointed. The food was quite delicious, but the mix up of the order ruined the experience for all of us. We were not able to start with our salad and we had to tell them how to rectify the problem instead of them taking the matter in their own hands.   The pizza was cooked perfectly, and the ingredients were fresh and evenly cooked. It's too bad this little blunder had to happen. But sometimes these things do. Not going to rule you guys out just yet..."}
{"text":"Do people in Mesa not know what good pizza tastes like? Thanks for deceiving me with the ridiculous amount of stars. Got a sausage and pepperoni thin crust pizza for delivery. Took an hour to arrive. On a Wed night... Whatever I guess. But I was hungry dammit- and that's a long frickin wait. On top of that, the pizza was so so. I couldn't get past 2 pieces and I'm usually a machine when I have a pizza in front of me.  Not enough cheese, way too much sauce, not enough flavor. Maybe more toppings would've helped (and extra cheese)- but a pizza should be good regardless of how much crap you slap on top of it. Also got the fries with garlic and cheese on them. They were cold and soggy on arrival, and nothing special. *sad trumpet playing* To me..it's one of those pizzas that you keep eating because you're desperate but you don't really want to, and then your filled with regret and a queasy feeling afterwards. Sigh. Best pizza in Arizona? lol hardly- you crazy girl. Won't try again. : /"}
{"text":"I've only gone here a couple of times, but the food and the service is top notch.  One time my online order did not go through, and when I got there they could not have been more accommodating.  They were apologetic, they knocked a couple bucks off the price, and the pizza was still ready in a timely manner.  The staff has always been friendly, and the pizza is the best in town!"}
{"text":"Second time coming..  Friendly staff, clean environment. Great pizza! They knew the pepperoni pizza slices we got were for the kids and they made sure to cut them into bite size bits. It completely showed they made sure to take care of each customers needs.  Its those little things and the great pizza that will keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"Marinara sauce shouldn't look or taste like tomato soup. Stromboli tasty but soggy. Zucchini ok but mostly breaded, not enough zucchini. Never going back. Great place for the Americanos that don't know what the real thing is supposed to taste like."}
{"text":"This was our first time ordering here and then devouring a large pizza with half of it pepperoni with black olives: the other half was the Italian Stallion (pepperoni, onions, bell pepper, tomato and mushrooms) I modified it from the original to fit our tastes.  To say it was delicious is an understatement. It was extraordinarily delightful. It set my tastebuds on alert and I wanted to keep eating more and more even though my husband and two adult sons were eating it as well. I ordered the pizza online. The website is easy to navigate and fail proof when it comes to placing an order.  My son and I drove 7.8 miles each way from where we live because of the excellent reviews we read. We will definitely return at a later date for more."}
{"text":"This stuff is good. Very good. It's why I order it despite a couple of significant issues. Once, the ranch for our wings came busted open and spilled all over the celery and carrots and the inside of the bag. Another time, the ETA was 50 minutes so we ran to the store and the guy showed up in under 20. What the hell? Y u gotta driver so fast? No but really. This pizza is FIRE AS FUCK."}
{"text":"I recently visited this location and I have had the best service each time I have gone. Three girls in particular; Hailey, Sam, and Nicole are always so sweet and so helpful. They have made each experience so great. Will definitely keep coming back because of these three!"}
{"text":"Wow! I can't believe this place has only 3 1/2 stars. As a native New Yorker I'm always looking for great NY pizza. Many make the claim but few deliver. This place definitely does! I had a slice of cheese pizza and it was just like home! Delicious! I found my new go to pizza spot."}
{"text":"So my friend was planning how to ask his girlfriend to marry him. She loves how corny his is and he always makes her laugh. He came up with the idea to get a heart pizza and write on the lid \" I know this is cheesy but marry me\" he called multiple places but no one would do it. I call here and Jerome answered he was so helpful. He said they could do it without any problems. The pizza turned out great. She loved it and of course said \"yes\" Thanks for making this a memorable moment for them!"}
{"text":"If you want a five-star review, you must be a five-star restaurant.  The floor where our group of seven ate was exceedingly slippery -- almost as if some sort of oil had been spilled and improperly cleaned-up.  The pizzas we ordered were satisfactory but for one flaw: the inner 5\"-6\" of the pizza was almost uncooked--warm, but definitely not cooked.  Both cooking time and temperature were off.  The marinara sauce was good.  Two stars off for the oily floor; one for the uncooked pizza."}
{"text":"First couple of times we ordered pizza to be delivered it was a solid 3.  It can take up to an hour to be delivered causing the pizza to be cold.  We ordered 1 topping pizzas because they are a good deal.  Now we order their Specialty Pizza.  The Italian Station or the Veggie.  Both taste wonderful to me and have come warm.  If you want a pizza straight out of the oven recommend not ordering by delivery or picking up on your way home.    Note:  Husband states he would only give it 4 stars, however I am the reviewer and give it 5"}
{"text":"i ordered the medium wings for lunch and they were disgusting. . They tasted like they were left over from the night before.  dry and no sauce hardly on them.  They are 1 of my favorite places for lunch but now I might have to find something else to eat there besides wings and hope i continue to eat there."}
{"text":"Whenever we have ordered pizza here, the food is awesome. However, twice in a row now I have had problems with online orders. The first two times I had a super long wait but finally got my order. There were plenty of people working but they didn't seem to have a system for prepaid take out orders--just one long line for everybody. Tonight I finally asked for a refund after waiting 30 minutes past the time I was quoted online. A guy who said he was a manager told me \"5 minutes\" (same thing he was saying to most of the crowd waiting for orders). When I asked for the refund they confirmed that my order hadn't even been started. Went to Little Caesar's and walked out with 2 pizzas in less than 2 minutes!"}
{"text":"Watch out all you pizzerias in the East Valley! This place is here to stay in business.  Venezia's is a great Italian place to get a slice of pizza anytime throughout the day. Creativity of their pies are amazing and only makes you want to return and try more. Of course well known for their pizza but I have also tried their calzones which are a must.  The food here is great but what also makes a great restaurant is their customer service and professionalism.  Why I give it 3 out of 5 stars?  I have eaten here three times before I finalized my ratings. All three times I have dine in, our orders/food were all cooked to perfection and delicious presentation.  On my first visits dinning in, there was a group of high school kids who walked in and were speaking too loud and saying nasty crude words. Enough that I could hear them across the restaurant while I was sitting trying to talk to my wife. I noticed that  none of the co-workers didn't do anything even though one of the workers behind the counter looked at the table due to hearing F*#£! I was at the restraunt for about 45 minutes all together and this group showed up after the first 15 minutes. No actions were taken.   Second visit, I came in for lunch in the middle of the week. Restaurant was fairly empty and quiet. I hear workers behind the counter talk about difficult customers they had in the past and swearing out loud. There is a lack of professionalism. I understand there will always be that one customer that will never be satisfied, but I still expect some professional bearing from workers in a restaurant because it makes me think, \"how do they think about me as a customer?\"."}
{"text":"Venezia's is a fantastic pizza place. They offer several different options including gluten free. One of our favorites is the pizza bowl - all the deliciousness of a pizza without the crust. It's great for anyone who is low-carb, keto or gluten-free.  My one complaint about Venezia's is their chronic lack of consistency. Some days, the service is amazing with the order being great. Then other days (more than should be often), there are serious issues including completely wrong order, terrible pizza construction (poor quality, no cheese, burned, wrong ingredients, etc.), and of course, incomplete orders. When this has happened to us, we call and speak with the manager and the manager gives a couple of dollars back to you for your next purchase, but that shouldn't be the solution. There should be clear process changes geared at keeping customers rather than being reactive and just abating customers. There is a complete lack of quality control and that illustrates a much deeper problem - the employees don't care.  Venezia's owners - please work with your employees. Ensure every piece of food that leaves your kitchen is up to YOUR standards...the kind of standards that you would expect when paying $40 for food. What's happening now is not acceptable. You have a great product but a horrible execution. Be better... your business and customers deserve that."}
{"text":"We ordered the Meatlovers pizza and a garden salad from here last night to go. I wouldn't say the pizza was the best I've ever had. It was just \"ok\". I would probably order again though because of the convenience."}
{"text":"WE NEED BEER..... I would give this place a 5 if they served beer and wine.  SO...I order my pizza ahead of time and pick it up to take home or use their delivery.  I have only once eaten in this establishment.  Venezia's pizza is awesome.  The thin crust is out of this world.  This is the closest best pizza I have ever had next to the one I had in NYC.  I love how you can pop in and order individual slices and they have a great selection to choose from.    Best Pizza between Superstition Fwy & Red Mountain 202."}
{"text":"We got the pesto chicken pizza. It was delicious! The kids enjoyed a half cheese half pepperoni pizza. While it was all very tasty, there was a lack of service. No one asked us how it was or offered to fill our glasses. Oh well."}
{"text":"Good stuff! Relaxed vibe and good workers! They have low carb pizza bowls! Pizza without the crust! Good option for cutting carbs!!"}
{"text":"I requested a poem about pizza to be written on the inside of the box and proceeded to completely forget about it until we opened the box at home. Needless to say, my boyfriend and I had quite the chuckle at this. 10/10 would slam again."}
{"text":"I will not be ordering from this place again. I have been a customer for years. My last order was botched so I called to report and received a credit to use to give this place a chance to redeem itself. I ordered a small sausage pizza, meatballs, garlic bread, a slice of chocolate cake, a chocolate cannoli, and a traditional canolli. And a 2 liter of Pepsi. The Pepsi is the only thing that came in the expected condition.  The pizza was cold. The traditional cannoli was somehow crushed during transit?  How, it boggles the mind. The meatballs packaging was not put together properly, the lid popped partially off, and everything in the bag was covered in the sauce that spilled. The garlic bread was dry and cold. Barely any garlic butter on them. A sorry state for garlic bread.  But they were smothered in meatball sauce from the spilled meatball sauce as well so . . . The chocolate canolli was intact but the filling was melted.  The chocolate cake was crammed into its packaging and when the packaging was opened it stuck to the lid and made a large mess of the cake.  The delivery guy was here at the expected time at least. But this was the last straw. I don't like spending my hard earned money for garbage food and garbage service."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. Ive been looking for good pizza since moving here 4 years ago. Im from Chicago so I know what good pizza is.  This is hands down the best pizza in the valley.  The sauce is also amazing. So good that I had to buy a jar to take home even though Im a chef and make my own sauce. LOL I will be coming back here over and over again. So happy I found a great pizza place. So far Ive tried jalapeno pepperoni pizza, cheese, chicken pesto and they have been amazing!!!  Good prices, high quality ingredients and a great atmosphere with some of my favorite tunes playing.  Yummmm Yummm Yummmm"}
{"text":"I can only comment on the one time I was there for lunch.  I ordered a calzone.  There weren't many people there, so I was surprised at how long it took to make.  But the calzone itself was very good, and the price was reasonable (~$9 with 3 add-ins).  I would come back again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good, but not great. It tasted a little bland and was required to check in to receive coupon code (which did not work) wings were great but a little spicy! (And I can handle spicy)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in the valley. The only reason that I took off one star is because lately they have messed up a lot of orders of ours and some of the pizzas have come out a bit sloppy. Other than that everything is generally on point and their pizza is the closest I have been able to find to pizza in upstate NY."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Food is just okay, it's incredibly overpriced. About 30% more than you'll pay at other pizza places.   First things first, I've ate here several times. It's gotten more and more average each time.  This go around, this is what we ordered:  Chicken wings, golden medium. The wings were cooked satisfactory, but I found the sauce to be incredibly thick, tangy, and sweet with little to no heat. For a full order of wings you received the usual carrot, celery and ranch cup. Wings were 4/10.  Large pizza, pepperoni and green olive. The outer crust was slightly burnt and crunchy, not chewy as I'd prefer. The crust itself is VERY thin and chewy and tens to flop over if you add any ingredients more than cheese. The sauce was good, not great and lacked seasonings. Pizza was 4/10.   Medium pizza, greek salad with chicken. This was a weird one. It was a baked pizza crust, with marina sauce, green salad on top, and what was advertised as chicken on top. The chicken seemed fake, and very rubbery, almost like it was a vegan chicken substitute. I'll eat just about anything, but I pulled the chicken off and thew it away. The salad came with FOUR dressing cups, yet the wings came with just one ranch which seemed odd. Salad pizza was 2/10.  All and all our bill was $38, for a PICKUP. No tip, or delivery fee added here. Save your tastebuds and wallet some aggravation and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"If I could give them no stars I would. We waited for 30 minutes for 2 cold slices of pizza and a small Caesar salad. They didn't put my salad in a to go box. I got to watch as my salad was passed around to 3 different employees. 10 minutes later I still don't have my salad. I had to get up and ask where my salad was. Only after that was my salad brought out. Also, while I waited I got to listen to coworkers talk to each other about their arrest records.... Not the best experience.... I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place for my pizza and wings fix! Went tonight for dinner, we all got pizza and wings combo. There ended up being an issue with my food and when I brought it to their attention, it was fixed immediately no questions asked by Jerome. They made sure I had a fresh new order of wings coming. While waiting Jerome came to my table and apologized for the inconvenience and gave us back a full refund for our whole table! I was shocked to receive such great customer service. Thank you for the awesome pizza & wings but even better customer service"}
{"text":"Great prices. Big huge pizza big enough for my whole family.  Only 20 bucks! The are timely.  They are polite.  The food is great. And the help is polite and professional.  We have this pizza alot.  And do delivery about once a week!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza joint in town! A few years ago when we got moved to this part of town I had ordered from Venezias and loved their pizza! They know how to cook it.  Besides the good quality of food they have amazing customer service! The second time I ever ordered from them they forgot my order and it arrived 30 Mins late. Not before I received a phone call explaining what was going on, then they comped my meal and gave me a credit to order again! I wasn't even upset!   Now 3 years later and we order from them again tonight and this week I had lost my debit card and ordered a new one that is coming in the mail. I used my stored card to place an order online. Everything went through and I didn't give it two thoughts. When we got there to pick it up, they said the card didn't go through.   The guy working tonight said \"just pay it forward\" and he covered it! I'll certainly be back in to take care of these guys this week. But it's great to know that we still have great people running great businesses in town!  Keep it up and have appreciated the business for years!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today, lunch specials are great. Pizza is amazing, I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch places! The decor and atmosphere is your fairly standard pizza place, but the food is much better than average.   I normally get 1 slice, a salad and drink for only ~ $6.50 for lunch. The slices are big and more than enough for me. The service is always friendly and efficient. Very casual, quick place for a great bite to eat."}
{"text":"Solid pizza and wings. Slices are rather large and taste good. Their wings also please the tongue. It won't break your budget either."}
{"text":"Best NY style pizzeria in AZ! I've been in love with this place since the Tempe, AZ location (best location). I'm happy that they finally put one in the north valley, but they need one in the west valley. This location is new and clean, but doesn't quite have the charm of the Tempe location. Still, great food at reasonable prices.  As long as they keep the same quality food and recipes I will continue to visit this great pizza joint for years to come!"}
{"text":"I ordered a 14\" pizza online and a full order of wings. Have had their pizzas in the past when I used to go to the east valley, so lad they opened a location here in north Phoenix. I built my own pizzas and I am impressed that I was able to order online and have the option of doing half and half. Pizzas was a bit greasy but that is partially my fault as I had t different types of meat on each half. The wings were good however it was drenched in BBQ sauce. I wish it had less sauce. The mildness of the winds / sauce was definitely on spot. Will definitely come back and definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I actually go here for the sandwiches not the pizza.  The pizza is 3 star.  But the sandwiches are boars-head meats, Served on a homemade toasted sub roll.   They are amazing.    Get a ham and turkey with melted provolone.    One of the best sandwiches in town."}
{"text":"Update- They made it right and their food has been consistent. One of our favorite places now! Old- There food is awesome when they get it right. We have only been there 3 times and 2 of those times they gave us the wrong wings. And the people up front just stare at you when you come to pick food up. Like can I give you my money ? I like their food but the service isn't great. For me that can make the difference between an alright place and a bomb one."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza! It's a little pricey for me, but it's really worth it. I love the combo pizzas and the chicken wings. Pros:  - Good pizza - Fill up your own soda - WIngs are good - Pretty good service   Cons - Greasy pizza - Slow - WIngs are overcooked any times"}
{"text":"I ordered the Italian stallion and it was not very good . The delivery was fast , but  the pizza was swimming in tomato sauce and had almost no cheese . Delivery was fast but I won't order there again."}
{"text":"I used to live in the east valley and fell in love with Venezia's in my 4 years living there. When I moved to the north Valley I was so excited to hear about one opening literally down the road from my house! Unfortunately, they have lost my heart. The customer service is beyond horrible and on multiple occasions I've gotten slices of pizza that were ice cold by the time I got home! The last time I ordered a slice I actually asked for them to put it in the oven a little longer and it was still cold. I've given them plenty of opportunities to redeem themselves but to no avail. I don't want to have to order a whole pizza just so it's hot.."}
{"text":"From Chicago to New York this place can hold its own with Pizza and Wings. Very friendly staff and they have the best new age style soda machines. I'm no talking about the cola version ones either."}
{"text":"What can I say about Venezia's that can convince you to try this place? This is the pizza joint as seen on TV's Breaking Bad.  Ok, let's begin.  ****** current offer is $1 OFF SLICE SPECIALS WITH YELP CHECKINS! ******  The pizza and wings are fantastic. That's all I have tried so far and it's great they open at 1030. Us early risers need lunch a little earlier some days.  Note: pizza may not be 'double cooked' if you order when they open so if you like it a little more well done then I'd say wait until 11 to show up.   So... ever had pizza with cheese that fell off and you just leave it on the plate? Not here! The cheese quality is fantastic and I'd never waste a single shred. The pizza slices they offer are cut from enormous 24 in pizzas so for me personally all I need is 1 slice.  The wings were really good too and actually too filling for me to finish with my slice. I got hot BBQ which was awesome for those of us who can't decide between BBQ and Buffalo sauce.   Lastly the fancy soda machine is a Pepsi version, not the ubiquitous Coke versions that seem to be everywhere these days. There's a whole ton of cool drinks in there including some really nice no calorie teas.   They have daily specials, reverse happy hour pricing and a specialty slice of the day that changes daily. Pics really don't do this food justice. Go, eat and remember to check in to get your $1 off slice specials.   buon appetito!"}
{"text":"I thought this was really good pizza and would recommended as a place for east coast friends to visit.  The staff was great and the place was super clean  It's a tie between this place and NYPD pizza for decent NY style in Phoenix so far. Breadsticks were great too. They do a 26\" pie which is a monster which is awesome for the family.  Thank you for the great pizza , I'll be be back!"}
{"text":"I love the food here but the customer service continues to be poor. But I can't stop going here cause I like the food, the employees just constantly seem to mess up orders and are generally pretty rude."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Venezia's, but unfortunately, they don't deliver to us, nor did they deliver to our previous house. I really wish they would use a delivery service like Amazon Prime, Door Dash, or Uber Food to deliver to the rest of the valley that they can't reach. We would have given them much more business if that was the case, and I'm sure others would too."}
{"text":"I hate to knock local businesses, but there are just so many better local pizza joints. I ordered chicken breast on my pizza, which was a mistake. It was rubbery and had a lot of fat. All the ingredients in fact tasted a sub-par, including the cheese and crust. Both my husband and I agreed. There are similar local chains that are much better quality and taste wise. I also ordered a Greek salad and that was at least a little better and not a bad price."}
{"text":"This pizza spot is great. My family and I went for some dinner and the staff were friendly and patient with us. One of the gentlemen that work there gave my little guys a free slice of pizza. Beer was amazing and the whole experience was great. We will definitely be going back for more pizza..."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty tasty. Could use a bit more cheese but the toppings tasted fresh and the heat was just right. The server brought out my slice to me which was a nice treat. The decor is modern comfy yet classic feel. I can't really describe decor well but that's my take. Will definitely be back for a slice."}
{"text":"Nothing special for the price. Crust is weird and toppings just slide off it. This is a one trip pizza. To bad it's in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We love this place and our food is usually good. On this visit however the boneless wings were gross.  The chicken pieces were mostly hard pieces of deep fried batter. There was also pieces with  very little sauce on them. Won't be getting those again!"}
{"text":"First time here. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted right away. The girl helped us to make a decision since the whole menu looked great. The honey hot wings were amazing and the garlic cheesy bread was actually full of cheese unlike most places. Then the pizza came.... omg it was sooooo good, nice, cheesy, hot and plenty of toppings!! We will definitely be coming back here"}
{"text":"Oh man! This is our GO TO pizza place! We always get the same thing...hubby gets The Italian Stallion, I get the Pizza Bianca with spinach and mushrooms, and we share the caprese salad. Love that I can order online and it was 15 minutes EARLIER than the estimated time we were given. Also, love that I can choose thin crust. The Party size is HUGE and so fun with a crowd. Love that they are in our 'hood!"}
{"text":"This would be a 5-star review if they served beer. I love the Italian Stalian pizza; it's delicious! The spicy pizza sauce has just the right kick of heat. I also really enjoyed the crust; it had a seasoning to it as well.We took home the leftovers and they tasted great the next day too!  The bad news, they no longer serve Sausage Smackers, which is a real shame because they give the pizzeria something all it's own. The side salad is just that, nothing too fancy.  Overall, this is a great place for food, but get it to go if you want to enjoy a nice cool drink with it."}
{"text":"Although the pizza is great (with the exception of their soggy artichoke hearts) and the other menu items are up to par, there were many people working at the registers just standing around. The food is expensive for the quality you get. I also noticed a short, red-haired manager yelling at several of their employees. It really brought a negative atmosphere to the restaurant experience. I will be going to Spinatos from now on!"}
{"text":"Really good place for slices at lunch time. Price is good also."}
{"text":"This was terrible! maybe living in Chicago has ruined us for Pizza everywhere else. But this pizza (as my 13 year old son put it) tasted like his rubbery school cafeteria pizza that comes out of the freezer and heated for the kids as a treat."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Great food great service everything is always on point! Just open one in the west valley is all I ask of you haha please please"}
{"text":"Another opening that was great!  I have been a HUGE fan of Venezia's since I first went to the Mill & Southern store in 2001.  Granted - the Tatum store has only been open a couple of weeks, so there are some things to be worked out.  However, I will say that this location is more on the ball than either the Ellsworth or McKellips locations were even after a few months.  Good NY style pizza (not that tomato and cheese cake from Chicago)...ask for it a little well done.  The value is also up there ... Lunch w/drink for under $7.00 ... and you'll work to finish it!  You get 2 slices (1/5th) of their BIGGG 24\" Party Pie (they cut it into 10 slices for slice orders).  VERY good value.  Get it with an extra topping - tomatoes & crumbled bacon - for a great taste.  Dom started me on that combo, and it's VERY tasty!  I'll be back again this coming week!"}
{"text":"Wow....so we order pepperoni, onion and garlic pizza.  One piece of pepperoni per monster triangle slice.  Never again.  $20 plus and they cut ginormous triangle cuts, didn't give hardly ANY pepperoni.  Basically a cheese pizza with an accidental touch of toppings paid for.  What a ripoff!  Won't make this mistake again."}
{"text":"Had a take out pizza last night. Worst pizza I ever had. The sauce tasted like globs of uncooked tomato paste. The crust did not have a good taste and the mozzarella cheese was dried out and tasteless. Highly recommend going someplace else. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"As many have already stated, we were VERY excited to have a new pizza joint in the neighborhood.  But we were very disappointed.  When I first order a pizza to be picked up, they got it all wrong and the \"kids\" working there were unapologetic.  I told them to make a new / correct one and I'll be back .. I never went back.  Gave them another shot and order a pizza to be delivered.  It was not good.  In fact, its the only pizza I have ever tossed in the trash after just a few pieces!!  Pretty much tasted like grease with crust that had ZERO flavor.  Just not good.  I have had better frozen pizza.  Too bad.  This place will be gone soon and we can only hope for a better pizzeria to come to our hood."}
{"text":"I've pretty much already reviewed the Venezia's in Tempe, but uhh, this place is just too good. The fact that they have multiple locations is even better. This one is right next to my significant other's house so I can pretty much hit his place up at any time. Essentially it is a staple to our diet. Imagine what would happen if the slaves didn't have cornmeal, or asians didn't have rice, or the Irish didn't have potatoes. Ok?"}
{"text":"I give it 3 stars as the pizza was a little above average. Ordered online and picked it up so I spent little time inside. Employee's where pleasant and accommodating."}
{"text":"Hello NY pie! This pizza is it for me! I'm a self confessed pizza nut and this place to me has the best NY style pizza IN PHX. Awesome sauce and crust. When you order an xtra cheese pizza it is actually covered in cheese - they don't skimp or cut corners. Price is honestly lower than what I'd expect for such a great product... I'd definitely pay more :)  They are always friendly when calling in an order and they deliver quick - what more do you need from your neighborhood pizza joint. I luv this place! Desert island pizza if you ask me."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical about coming here this evening  but with the kind customer service from Peter (the manager) and the warm pizza all my worries went away. I officially found my new pizza fix! Amazing food and kind employees!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for something new and was blown away!  Fantastic pizza at competitive prices.  Since our first visit we've been a number of times.  Try them out for some great pizza!"}
{"text":"Just mediocre, I was disappointed after reading all the hype, but then I grew up on the east coast and I know what the real thing should taste like! The crust looked good but nothing, just bland and same for the sauce, I could not even taste it! Damn, why is so hard to get an East coast style pizza made decently around here? Also would try a pasta dish but they do not have my fave eggplant parm!  Sigh"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery and it took longer than expected. That being said, the pizza was delicious! The largest pizza is HUGE. I've never seen larger pizzas!!   We will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"Reason I gave it a 5 * rating is because this it some of the best pizza I've eaten. The atmosphere is like a pizzeria, not a chain or corporate atmosphere. You get your money's worth, and they offer a lot of variety as far as food goes. It tastes authentic, may I recommend asking for crushed garlic on your next Pepperoni or Supreme Slice? They have Oregano on the table alongside the common parmasean and pepper shakers..Smart! Cause the Oregano tastes awesome with the garlic.   It's not busy the times I've been in, and Personally I'd like to keep it that way. I know the Manager would feel otherwise, haha. The Employees have always been friendly and greet you with a smile. They're awesome. And they can give you some suggestions on what to order if you cannot decide.   The place is clean and immaculate, I cannot say enough good things about this place.   You really should consider trying this place out at  least once. You wont regret it. Just don't take my word for it.  [READER: PLEASE ADD ME AS A FRIEND!]"}
{"text":"Definitely want to come back to try the slices- they're oversized and look incredible. However, being that I'm trying to stay away from carbs currently, I went for the protein bowl. The lady taking my order suggested the Diablo bowl which has grilled chicken, cheese, onion and Jalapeños. Personally, I would not reorder again. Too much cheese and way too many jalapeños. And they're hidden, so it's challenging to avoid them. I eat unhealthy stuff fairly frequently, but this made my tummy hurt. My coworker had the meat lovers, and it looked killer good. Wings also looked yummy. They offer $3 wine with purchase of a slice and have $5 wine Wednesday, Sat and Sun specials."}
{"text":"This place was our go to. We went here once a week with our family. At the Gilbert location Dana is amazing and our kids always ask about her. Cameron as well and Tyler all became parts of our family. The food is great, and the atmosphere is great too. I have to say the prices have creeped up and for our family was 35 a week. It has gotten to be 55 a week. For this price I can go to a sit restaurant with service. Instead of going every week now we're going here maybe once a month. The food prices went up and really the quality changed too, the pizza remains the same, but the boneless wings changed, the cheese sticks changed. Saddens us to see this."}
{"text":"The pizza here is good, however my experiences haven't been. I've ordered from here many times since I live nearby.  I've been double charged once, and I called to let them know. The manager said they'd look into it and I didn't hear back or get a refund for two days. I finally went into the location and talked to a different manager who did finally fix it after first trying to tell me he'd look into it and get back to me. He tried the same thing the first manager did and I didn't accept that. I showed proof of the two charges and was FINALLY given my money back. The delivery here is always slow, and the pizza is often not hot when received. It is also pretty pricey as well. There are better, locally owned places in the area for a more reasonable price."}
{"text":"Venezias never disappoints!  My favorite pizza place hands down.  Even if you are not in the mood for pizza they have so many other options like subs, pasta and pizza bowls.  I ordered the veggie pizza bowl for the first time to tonight since I was not in the mood for bread and it was so delicious. Everything always tastes fresh. If you have not yet been here you are missing out. :)"}
{"text":"Best pizzeria in Phoenix! So glad we found this hidden gem. If you are in North Phoenix...GO, now! You'll be so glad you did."}
{"text":"Venezia's is hard to pronounce, but a very good pizza restaurant. The slices are huge and the servers are friendly and helpful. This was our second time eating here with our twin baby boys. We ordered separate pizza slices in pepperoni and sausage, and some breadsticks for the boys. The atmosphere was with average noise, but not distracting from our own family meal. TVs show sports and there is soft background music.   Next time we want to get one of their extra large pizzas in their extra large pizza boxes."}
{"text":"Consistently good food, fast service and top quality customer service. There is a reason why is see the same regulars when I come in here on my weekly visit. Update on my diet....didn't stick but who cares!? Today I ordered The Phoenix Rising Pizza and it was bomb diggity bomb. Fat man tip, get some jalapeno and BACON BACON BACON on that thing!"}
{"text":"I don't know if this is true NY style pizza.  I've never been to NY, and any reference to NY pizza I have is food channels and watching Tony eating two slices at the beginning of Saturday Night Fever so what do I know?  However,  I know what I like and I LOVE their cheese pizza.  I do like all types of toppings, but I feel you can judge a good pizza by the simple cheese.  I admit, it was Breaking Bad that turned me on to Venezia's but an awesome show directed me to this awesome restaurant.  I have to confess,  I gave in one night to another pizza place that had a good deal on two mediums.  I won't mention their name but it rymes with Shlominos.  It was horrible!  I will never stray again!  You have a forever loyal customer."}
{"text":"My wife is a vegetarian and it is hard to find a place where we can both eat, this is that place! Absolutely delicious pizza and the macaroni and cheese bites are delicious. We woke up the next morning craving more of their pizza, will definitely be back again and again"}
{"text":"I work down the street so we come here a lot. The staff is usually really friendly and the food always comes out fresh! The pizza slices are huge and their new canolis are amazing! I've only been there for lunch so I only know their lunch special prices and their pretty decent!"}
{"text":"I've never posted on Yelp before but I had such a great experience at Venezia's that I wanted to let everybody know.  The food was excellent and the service was just as good. Couldn't believe it when the owner came out, and make sure that everything was OK. Great dining experience, and I will now use them for catering for my business."}
{"text":"Tried out this place because of the great reviews; however, being from NYC, I was skeptical as to how the slices would match up against my beloved authentic corner pie places in the city. Let me tell you- came pretty darn close!!  The pizza was great. We tried the pesto chicken with ricotta and a slice of chicken, spinach, and bacon. The sauce was a little too sweet for my tastes, but it didn't stop me from finishing it :)  Greek salad was really good as well. I can't speak to the or pizza places in the area, but I would recommend this one!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza to order near my house. All of those nationwide chain pizza joints offer such terrible products, I don't know how Americans stand it. If you want great handmade, family owned, down home goodness, Venezia's is where it's at. They also have some of my very favorite hot wings, sweet wings, and buffalo wings in the valley (which is saying A LOT, because I am obsessed with wings and try to go everywhere that brags about them. I am soooooo critical about wings, but these guys have it down). Another plus is that they have true deli-quality sandwiches with the hands-down best meatball sub and Italian beef you're going to find in Mesa, guaranteed. The salads are also delicious, man I could go on forever about this place. In short, it's a family favorite and a stand-by anytime I want great, affordable food for myself or my friends. For someone I didn't like, sure, I'd get them Little Caeser's (I can say that, I worked there). But for anyone who I care about, I want the best for them. And for the best, look to Venezia's."}
{"text":"I love this place. Have been ordering delivery from here for about a year now.  Always friendly on the phone. I've dined in once. Cool place. Friendly staff. Delicious food."}
{"text":"I absolutely hate giving this review because I love this location and the food is amazing, buuuuuut I just don't understand why you offer a check in deal with Yelp! and not honor it. There are many people who make dining choices based on these. We were told that sometimes the codes don't work, but I'll go ahead and give you a dollar off, when it should have been closer to 10."}
{"text":"We always order pizza and the antipasto salad from Venenzias Pizza. We are close to the one on Ellsworth Rd just South of Baseline Rd in Mesa. They are amazing and always serve quality food. If you want amazing pizza cooked to order with fresh ingredients give them a call. The customer service is great too!! If you ever have a concern just let them know and they make it right.  Try a jar of their spicy relish.  They have great deals on pizzas and daily specials. Totally worth it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Driving buy near the house got 2 slices and a drink . wow really good place is super nice . new building"}
{"text":"The cheese sticks were tossed into a bag (rather than a to go box) for delivery to us and were ice cold upon arrival. The pizza taste and quality was great. I think it was too much to spend for what we got, but the flavor profile was on point."}
{"text":"Best wings in town!! This place sets the bar high for pizza and calzones. Honey BBQ wings are amazing!  Great daily specials as well"}
{"text":"Excellent New York style pizza! Friendly people and fast delivery! Highly recomended."}
{"text":"Terrific pizza and service!  However, I mostly go for the wings. Food is always hot and consistent.  The customer service is always on point."}
{"text":"Well, I gave them a second try.  12:00 on a weekday and they were practically empty.  Uh-oh.  I had a slice of pepperoni and an Italian Beef.  When I ordered it \"wet\", I got this weird look.  It took them about 15 minutes to put this together.  The pizza was dry and tasteless.  A New Yorker buddy insists that good New York pizza should have grease running out of the corner when you fold the slice.  This one was dry.  Oh, I said that :-)  Crusty too.  a couple slices of pepperoni stuck to the dry sauce.  The Italian Beef was so-so.  Completely dry, but there was a little cup of jus to dip it in. Covered in giardineira, it was hot, but small for the price.  I cannot imagine anyone serving Italian Beef and not knowing how it is served."}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing. I love how you can order buy the slice. The slices are huge!!!   I had the pesto and my kids had the Hawaiian and both were soooo good. There is always a great selection. It's never your plain boring one topping choices."}
{"text":"Great slices and whole pizzas, I personally love the chicken pesto pizza. Their boneless wings are amazing too!"}
{"text":"Great new place on Tatum Blvd! The pizza is awesome. Love the atmosphere. It's relaxed and great for families."}
{"text":"It's not five-star pizza, since I'm originally from NYC. However, I've tried as many different pizza places I could find in the East Valley, and this is the best. Their crust is not quite authentic, but it is the right consistency and isn't the sad, doughy Chicago-style pizza that is more prevalent around here. The price for a regular pie is good, but their specialty pies are a little pricey. However, the lunch specials are a great value as the slices are from a 24\" pie. The Friday meat-lovers special, and the daily chicken pesto pizza are my favorites. My coworker loves their HUGE antipasta salad, and typically gets three meals out of it. They use Boar's Head meats for their sandwiches, although I stick to pizza. We were not impressed by their french fries, though. This pizza is good enough that it's become a regular weekly lunch stop, and/or a Friday night dinner for the wife and I."}
{"text":"Been searching for a good pizza place in town  for a while and we finally found it. Super tasty and they deliver!"}
{"text":"Recently moved here from NY. Was craving pizza and read the reviews. So I gave you a try. Well I was pleasantly surprised.  First the order process was easy .  Second your driver was right on time and extremely polite.  The pizza , antipasto salad were great. Thin crust cooked just right. Wings were good too.  I'll be ordering again   Thank you"}
{"text":"First, Venezia's does an opening -well-. From the  inflatable Grand Opening monoliths (seriously thought they might be filming a remake of _2001_), to having all hands on deck to make it as efficient as possible (and they were slammed!) and having that staff well prepared with smiles and cheer - they won the opening.   And the staff weren't just happy, but helpful as well. Service was a little slow, but given the sheer number of people, probably as fast as was possible.   The new building looks great, nice atmosphere, comfortable space, appropriately lit, delicious smells, all good things.   The only downside to the visit was the crust is just not my favorite. The wife's pizza was a little underdone so didn't have that nice crisp we look for, and my calzone was a little tough and chewy.   On the other hand, the toppings were great (as a matter of fact the homemade meatballs _literally_ got a round of applause from the one year old!), sauce is good, like having ricotta as an option and portions were a good value for the money. I'm willing to come back and give the crust another chance."}
{"text":"Amazing people work here! Thank you for making my event great! Amazed at how great the staff is!"}
{"text":"Pizzas were large and had lots of toppings, but crust was not a traditional new style type. The supreme has so many toppings that it got soggy very quickly. The cheese sticks were great. Wings were okay. Ordering on the phone was easy, delivery was right around the given time."}
{"text":"Big fan of Venezia's pizza, ever since I first tried their location in Tempe. Plus, as being known as the very pizza thrown up on White's residence in Breaking Bad. You know it's gotta' be good!  Ordered a combo of a slice of pizza, 6 wings, and a drink for a quick meal. Got the combination with Honey BBQ wings and a fountain drink. The pizza slice was big, not as fresh or hot, but definitely had that NY signature thin crust. The cheese wasn't as melted or gooey, as it is when you order a whole pizza but still okay. The wings are decently sized and appropriated sauced. Soda fountains here are a touch screen system which definitely saves room for the place and gives customers plenty of options.  The slices and chicken came out in a relatively quick time. Tons of booth or table seating available inside with TVs in the corner.  Check-in on Yelp for $1 off a slice of pizza."}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza served in a timely manner. Great value for the price. We will be back."}
{"text":"Dang!  My college buddy ordered this after we played 18 holes.  He's from Mesa.  I just moved here from Denver.  I'm a pizza snob and this pizza kicks butt.  Amazing amount of cheese, really good dough, and awesome tasting marinara.  I'm seriously impressed.  Can't wait to try another pie from you guys soon.  AC"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery last night n was disappointed with the pizza.. it was greasy n the meat tasted not pleasant either.."}
{"text":"When they first opened this was my go to place. I will admit that I love their pepperoni pizza and grilled onions. However today when they forgot the fries on a take out order I had to come back, the sandwich was wrong, and there were no napkins in the takeout bag. When I called to address this Lucy gave me a half-hearted aw I'm so sorry. I am looking for a new favorite sandwich shop."}
{"text":"The wife is from New York and is particular about her pizza. Venezias is one of the few locals places that passes the test."}
{"text":"Came in for Pizza Friday- has some boneless wings and a giant pizza. Very cool deal- lots of food, reasonable price. The thing is though, the pizza was a bit soggy in the middle- makes serving gigantic slices a little hard to do. So, my advice? Don't get the humongous pizza- go for one they can cook all the way though. You'll enjoy it.  New York-style thin crust, good sauce, good toppings."}
{"text":"Very Good!!! We found a REAL NY Style Pizza Place. Cannolis are sooo good, Pizza awesome, Salad great & Love the parmesan peppercorn dressing. Crumb cake comes from Brooklyn! They use Boars Head Cold Cuts too! Can't get better than this!"}
{"text":"This is the pizza you try, you enjoy, and then you think about it for days! There isn't another place in the valley you can go and get authentic italian recipes, quality ingredients and consistent deliciousness!!! I've frequented all the locations since the beginning in '98, and Tatum and Greenway is the epitome of everything Venezias is about...amazing food, family, community, and now adult beverages! It doesn't get any better than that!  P.S...to all you haters that claim this isn't real NY style... You can't get more real than this. Venezia's is what legendary NY pizzerias are all about. Proud Immigrant Italian families, sharing their prized recipes that might have adapted with time and location, (ie. no more san marzano tomatoes grown in volcanic, Napoli soil in the backyard garden like Nonna used to do) but none the less have been passed down for generations. It's the hard work of the staff and support of the surrounding neighborhoods that complete the whole package.  And last but not least, It's the pride in providing the community with an authentic, heritage based product at a fair price. Mangia!"}
{"text":"Venezia's has some pretty good pizza and they are quick to deliver. Our favorite is the Italian Stallion (pepperoni, sausage, and jalapeños) which is just the right amount of spice, flavorful sauce, and crisp crust. I'd say, for me, not as good as Spinatto's but better than Pizza Hut, Dominos, Sardella's etc.   I'd also recommend wings from Venezia's. Sometimes, I find takeout wings to be a little soft and flabby but never at Venezia's. They are crisp and sauced to perfection."}
{"text":"I could care less if Walter White threw your pizza on his roof. I felt like doing the same after tasting this \"New York Style\" pizza...... this is directly from a native New Yorker. Your pizza is Albuquerque style, at best!"}
{"text":"Love this place for pizza!  The chicken pesto is my favorite.  Our family & friends gather at the various locations often because of the quality and cost of food here."}
{"text":"Don't throw this Pizza on your roof! This is some good pizza. So glad to finally have one in the North Valley. I used to drive out of my way to the one on Tempe every so often just to get the pizza. My friends swear by the Italian Gold wings, but I am not one to mess with them.  For some reason, and maybe just because I am used to great NY Style pizza being sold by the slice, I prefer to buy individual slices instead of the fresh hot pizzas. I think it has something to do with how the cheese hardens or solidifies after it sits for a little bit, and then gets fired back up in the Pizza oven for a few quick moments, Call me crazy, but it's different.  Their party pizzas are enormous! Just a total gut buster......then again I probably shouldn't be sitting down to eat half of one by myself, but to each their own!"}
{"text":"I love eating lunch here. Their Antipasto salad is amazing! It is a large portion with tons of meat. I also like to add chicken. The staff is very friendly and they make sure food promptly."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent employees! However, they need a new online ordering platform. Extremely dated, touchy and inconsistent. Took forever to modify anything without nuking my inputs, and didn't actually save any of my info for future orders."}
{"text":"Best pizza me and my mom ever had we also had the cannoli yesterday and the garlic wings we have to say this has to be the best pizza place we ever had also very friendly staff we will be coming back in the future thank you Venezia you really are new York style! Not only that they forgot to charge us one cannoli but gave us the one for free and I bought my own we are very satisfied with this place!"}
{"text":"We went there on a Monday at about 11:15am. There were two guest who had came in before us and thats it. We ordered a philly steak hoagie, italian beef hoagie and one slice of pizza. The young lady who helped me was happy and nice. My Wife ordered separately, and the young lady who helped her was ok, but without emotion. 7 guest came in behind us. They all ordered a single slice and a few had wings. They all got their meal before us. We waited 25 minutes to get our hoagies. When they brought them from the back, they also had several bags with togo orders. The pizza slices are large and ok. I would say about like a Rays Pizza. The Hoagies were good but the wait was way to long when you are trying to grab a quick lunch. If your not in a rush, it would be ok. The hoagies were hot when they arrived and were just under $10 each. They are not big enough to split (about 7\"?) unless you get a slice with them to split. We had a slice of specialty pizza, which was just over $4. We would stop in to get a slice if we were near there, but we wouldn't go out of our way.   We give them 3 stars for taking to long with the hoagies. If they had arrived quicker, then I would say a 4 star would be about right."}
{"text":"Pizza is one of my favorite foods and Venezias is right up there when it comes to fast, take out pizza. Love the pizza and the salad is great too!"}
{"text":"I have been in for a slice at lunch. And it was very good. But I have ordered delivery twice. The crust has been delivered soggy. And the pizza is overly greasy on top. TJ's is down the street. They are consistently good Pizza. Go to TJ's instead."}
{"text":"First time at Venezia. Really good pizza. Crust was crispy and not too thick a doughy. We also had the meatballs. Excellent! Their sauce is really nice. Not too acidic at all. Very well balanced. Lasagna was tasty. Worth the wait. The noodles weren't overdone and mushy like some other places tend to do. Considering they just opened on Thursday, they are hitting it out of the park. The techno geek in me appreciated the touch screen soda machines. ;)"}
{"text":"The worst experience getting take out.. I ordered in person ordering 3 things. They forgot the slice of pizza and made the wrong sandwich.. I went back.. They made the sandwich with peppers which I didn't want and it was cold. :(  also had to step over garbage which was there for more than hour both times I went back. Staff of 5 and can't keep it clean or get orders correct. Red white and brew right down the street for pizza and toms for beefs or the Chicago place on power from now on. No more staff lunches from me."}
{"text":"Update: The manager did give me a $10.00 credit to try their pizza again. I ended up getting a small pizza instead of slices to see if that was better. It was fresh, and hot and  the staff was really nice and the pizza was good but I think the sauce is a little bland the toppings were generous, but I also like my crust with some crisp to it. I really like high flavor in my food, but cooking for the masses it is hard to achieve the right flavor. My friend loves bland food and this would be perfect for her. Me I would prefer more flavor. But that is just my taste. Other than that not bad pizza and with coupons it is a decent price. I gave the four stars for the good service."}
{"text":"I really don't know what happened the Saturday we went. The whole place was a mess! We received the wrong salad to start out. Then it took around 30 minutes to get a batch of wings. With our pizza still not on the table we went to ask about it. The girl was wandering around everywhere like a chicken with its head cut off! After finally receiving the pizza we were still missing wings. At that point we decided to forget it and leave. Service was horrible!"}
{"text":"Came in late and had a salad and a meatball sub. The meatball sub was very good. Crunchy bread and moist meatball. The antipasto was large and much better than average. I have 5 choices of Italian close by with food very similar including Crust and Streets of New York. I have had pizza here once and it was good just not my type. So we are sticking with salads and the sandwiches."}
{"text":"My kids love the pizza here and I think it is great, too. I especially like that their lunch specials are available on weekends and that I can get a slice and a salad as one of them.   The people at the register are consistently friendly and orders are delivered quickly, especially if you order slices from the case and they're waiting for you to order them.  There are a variety of dressings available for the salads and there's a rotating special pizza of the day. Try the Italian Stallion and Spicy Hawaiian if you enjoy your pizza with a little kick."}
{"text":"I love this pizza! Prices are good, delivery service is fast, and the pizza is always fresh and amazing!"}
{"text":"OMG this is now our favorite delivery place!! We had a flyer in one of those valuepaks and decided to try it. We love that they deliver! We got their calzones, pizza, loaded fries and desserts. We were so excited. We were so impressed with the food. The hot things were hot and the cold things were cold. And everything tasted amazing!! And the delivery person was very friendly. The next time we got Venezia's we tried their sub sandwitches and could not believe how good they were....Everytime we try something different we are pleasantly surprised with wonderful tasting food!! Thank you Venezia's!!! We adore you!!"}
{"text":"The \"Party Pizza\" is really the only recommendation I have.  It is fantastic and deserves 5 stars.  The staff and the delivery people that they have also deserve 5 stars. I'm giving 4 stars because sometimes if you order the smaller sizes, it comes with too much crust on the edges for my liking.  I have called in about it and they say \"make a request to put the sauce and cheese to the end\". The times that  I have remembered to do that, it has been fantastic. My question is \"Why should you have to ask?\" I just preferred it when it wasn't  required \"to request\" but apparently like many businesses, they are trying to cut costs.  This is however, one of the best pizza places in East Mesa and it is especially popular with the teenage crowd.  All the teenagers love this place!  The pizza is really great fresh and hot but not so much reheated, so order an amount that you will eat.  Just an FYI."}
{"text":"Pretty incredible value for your money. The lunch special of 2 slices and drink is pretty ridiculous for 7 bucks or so. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!  Originally got hooked at the Tempe location while attending ASU and have been big fans ever since.  My husband and I especially love their take on the classic New York style pizza.  We don't dine in often, but enjoy their easy online ordering particularly on those nights when we are on our way home from work and don't have anything in the house.  If you're a wing lover then you gotta try their golden sauce, it is delicious (and great for dipping your pizza into too!)."}
{"text":"Went to Venezia's last night for the first time specifically to try their NO-CRUST pizza bowl.  I LOVED it.  For all of us Keto/Paleo/Atkins peeps who want to enjoy the flavor of pizza without the guilt this is a God send. I had mine with Chicken, onion and calamata olives.  It was HUGE and also very reasonably priced under $9.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Came here thinking I would have a similar experience as I did numerous times at the E. Mesa location. Truly disappointing! Ordered my usual slice of cheese combo with boneless hot BBQ wings. The pizza was luke warm and the crust was completely soggy! Seems like it was just put in the microwave or had been sitting there since it opened for the day. The boneless wings were pretty good but nothing to rave about. Won't be coming back! Maybe the management could take some tips from the other locations to bring it up to par to the Venezia's standard."}
{"text":"Been eying this place for awhile as there aren't many pizza places around this area besides the ever regrettable chains (papa johns, pizza hut, etc..) so my expectations weren't terribly high, but I still was interested to see what this place had to offer.   That being said, the pizza itself was decent. We ordered half cheese, half pepperoni but it came out entirely pepperoni. Not wanting to cause a scene just to get a half cheese pizza we just ate it anyways. Not a big deal.   I try to ignore the \"New York Style\" taglines of pizza places whenever I am anywhere but New York, because I grew up eating pizza in the city and nothing ever quite seems to be on that level. Wasn't bad, but nothing stood out either. I enjoyed my meal but I won't be craving a return (not to say I won't be back, I'm sure that time will come.)  Place was pretty dead but it was a Sunday night so understandable. We ate in (I'm sure they do a ton of take out) and you order at the counter and then place a number on your table and they deliver your food to you. Employees were nice.   Had to ask twice for ranch (again, not a huge deal) but it was probably some of the best ranch I've had in awhile.. (yes I'm that freak who dips the crust into ranch).   We were craving chocolate cake, so we tried theirs as well. Kind of like the pizza, good but not memorable. For 6 bucks a slice, I'd say it's a little overpriced.   Moral of the story: if you are in the area and want pizza, it's a solid and safe bet. But I wouldn't drive out of my way to visit."}
{"text":"Delicious real NY pizza, reasonably priced. We also had a greek salad which was excellent, lovely fresh chopped dark green romaine with olives, peppers, onions, tomatoes, feta and a great dressing.  Prompt delivery."}
{"text":"Pizza slices very reasonable priced and very flavorful. Speedy service. Very clean restraint. Would come again."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great service! What more can you ask? Their slices are huge as well! And the owners are soo nice! I love coming here. The place is nice and clean and they have games outside as well."}
{"text":"Great place to eat with family and friends.  Excellent pizza and salads.  The price is right and watch for their coupons for additional savings."}
{"text":"For a truly, NY style pizza, Venezia's is the place. Fast, efficient service. Inexpensive pricing for the lunch special, a large slice of pizza and a choice of salad (Greek or tossed) and a beverage. Special menu for each day provides a tasty variety. Special order pizza is also available"}
{"text":"We had a coupon so we tried this place out and it was delicious!!! We ordered wings, large pizza and garlic bread. The wings were pretty tasty, not a ton of meat. The pizza was really good too! But my favorite was the marinara sauce that came with he bread! Soooo delicious! I want to try a pasta or something with that sauce all over it! We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The pizza delivery service they provide is consistent and the pizza always hits the right spot. My employees and I have grown to love ordering from this place. They never miss a beat"}
{"text":"It seems this Venezia pizzeria is still trying to find its place in the world. This, the fifth Arizona location of the promising Arizona pizza chain (a descendent of the NM restaurant of Breaking Bad fame), already seems tired. Employee of the month? No photo posted. Seems odd given that friendly employees are this spot's greatest strength in my view. Low energy management? Hard to say. The décor of this newly constructed space is mostly industrial (ceiling, chairs), but the tables and booths don't seem to match the style. No matter really, but again an oddity for a newly designed space.   We passed on the pizza by the slice this Saturday afternoon. A bargain at $2.50 for a huge cheese slice, but the slices looked pretty tired (a theme), so we passed. Not enough traffic for fresh slices late on a Saturday afternoon I suppose. The fresh one item pizza we ordered was promptly served. Solid. Not award winning gourmet pizza solid, but enjoyable. A touch soggy in the center. The Greek salad we ordered was solid as well, but not as good as one we had at seasoned competitor Streets of New York Pizza just a week earlier.   There is a dog friendly patio, a plus. Unfortunately it's located on the south side of the building, rendering it unusable during the day in the summer months. Also no table umbrellas in sight, so you're not really even given the option of risking an outside table during the day. Perhaps they break out the umbrellas at other times of the day or year? Tired decision making if that's the case. Corn hole out front, shaded much of the day which is nice, but there is no real seating for dining there.   Plastic utensils and paper plates. Pepsi branded soda machines with flavor choices. Pricing, especially if you utilize available coupons, is very reasonable. A 24 inch two person pizza challenge also exists for those inclined to win a t-shirt and get their photo on the wall. In sum, Venezia's was never intended to be a fine Italian dining establishment. It simply serves the neighborhood.  There is a lot to like, but the vibe is that of a place that has been open for decades, not months. The youthful City of Tempe, Venezia's home turf, naturally brings an energy to a restaurant. There's no such built in advantage on North Tatum, however, and Venezia needs to find a way to transfer a little of the Tempe vibe to Tatum. The foundation exists. We like Venezia's well enough to visit again to see how they do."}
{"text":"tits.. don't listen to Something. Venezias used to keep me alive when I lived in Tempe. Best NY pizza in AZ-"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but the quality of the food is far too inconsistent. This seems to happen at Phoenix and Chandler locations. The pizza is not bad but the dough is either cooked too long or is soggy. When you pull a slice of pizza off the pan it should not be so soggy that if flops over and the topping fall off. I have not had an issue with the sandwiches but you can't really screw up a meatball sub."}
{"text":"The Cons:  I went in a Sunday after church time. It was wall-to-wall people and screaming kids. I don't have kids and don't want to hear screaming kids anytime, let alone while I'm eating. If you want quieter surroundings, avoid Sunday's at noon.  The menu is on the wall without any description as to what each pizza contains. I had to wait to get to the counter to grab a menu to see what I wanted. I ordered a 16\" pizza to go. It cost $25!!  I entered the building at 12:09, placed my order at 12:19 per my receipt. I got in my car to leave with my \"takeout\" pizza at 12:57!! I feel like my order was forgotten several times along the way.  Unfortunately, the pizza wasn't worth the wait. It wasn't bad, but definitely not NY style. I will stick with Papa Murphys down the street which I can pick up, cook and eat in less time than I spent waiting at Venezias.  The Pros:  The employees bust their butts. They hustle like no other. While waiting, I was checked on several times and offered water. But by that point, I needed whisky and earplugs, not water!!!!  Still a nice gesture.  They did give me two free desserts for the inconvenience. I'm not a tiramisu connoisseur, but I thought it was delicious.  The Result:  I will try them again and I will most definitely use their delivery feature the next time using the menu I took home."}
{"text":"Love this place.  We do a lot of take out and delivery.  Always spot on.  Jerome is my go to guy.    Dawn Scottsdale"}
{"text":"I would give these guys a 4 stars if they would serve beer with pizza, but they said they won't because of the \"area\". BS, you are a business and you make the rules...pizza and beer just go together.  Their pizza is great and you can usually catch up and watch a game on tv there. Their wings are decent. Their service is excellent and they are nice folks that work there. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"We ordered to go pick up, the food is okay. The only disappointed is they messed up our order, we got home and found out that's not our order. So we had to drive back and switch it, maybe they should double check the order before they hand out the food."}
{"text":"The best! Needed a good lunch for one of my last days of summer before school starts again and this was the best find! I'll be back and I'll bring tons of friends!"}
{"text":"I've had the calzone there twice now and both times it was AWESOME! i highly recommend this place if you're looking for a calzone...or fried zucchini...or French fries!!"}
{"text":"If you want delicious cheesy and great quality pizza then this is the place. My hubby is from the mid west and he loves his pizza. This place is our go to place when we choose to have delivery. Aside from pizzas, their appetizers and salads are great too.  I highly recommend this location and their pizzas."}
{"text":"Honestly coming from New York this food is absolutely delicious so sad that I had to give it a two star rating based on horrible customer service. I am so annoyed I am writing this review as I sit inside the restaurant. When we called to place a pick up order the person who took our order was so rude and rushing us off the phone, I understand they might have been busy but we knew what we wanted and we were just asking in what quantities the wings came in, he said 5 and 10 so we said we wanted 15 and he repeated then come in 5 and 10 and I'm no math genius but if they come in increments of 5 then they come in 15. So I said yes so I want 15 and he goes so you want an order and a half? For me it was just so unnecessary and frankly rude and condescending considering the tone in his voice. To make it worse the lady working the counter had a huge attitude problem and insured of placing our change in my husbands hand she basically threw it at him. What a shame! Train your staff better"}
{"text":"I love this place the food is awesome the owner is Awesome & the staff !!! This is our go to Friday night pizza place the wings are best in town the pizzas are always fresh hot and delicious, one of my new favorites is the Margherita pizza for a healthier option & does not lack for taste. The staff is friendly it reminds me of Cheers where everyone knows your name lol I don't know if that a good thing or not ;) do yourself a favor and eat here you won't regret it !!!"}
{"text":"Over the past months I've called in to-go orders on a busy Saturday night, randomly throughout the week, and even Sunday's. The orders are accurate, the food is fresh. The pizza is best enjoyed hot, garlic bread and marinara are great starter, but the salads are my go too. The Greek salad is my pick. Ordering dessert is a must, enjoy the taste and share it with 4-6 people, forget calorie count. Little cannoli packs a punch, I love pairing coffee and their crumb cake, tiramisu is excellent, the chocolate cake is uniquely awesome. You can always order a plate of veggies too."}
{"text":"Closest in taste to true NY pizza that I've had so far in the valley. Their customer service is phenomenal as well, to say the least. Additionally, this location is well decorated and conveniently located."}
{"text":"HUGE SLICES!  this pizza is amazing especially if you miss great East coast style pizza..love the sauce and they don't glob it on like other places, very friendly service every time i go in--LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"The atmoshere inside was nice. The only thing is the booths are a tight squeeze (at least the one we sat in- low booth seats and high table and table so close to your chest). I recommend sitting in the chairs and table rather than a booth. Pizza was really good and so was service. We also had some wings, and they were ok (nothing special)."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in town!  Awesome wings and great salads. Terrific ambiance with plenty of flat screen TV's for sports viewing and a great seating area outside along with baggo games. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Had their pizza delivered twice while visiting family.  I'm a NY native and this is some of the best pizza I've had.  My wife's family loves it now too. Will order again when we are back in town"}
{"text":"On my return from work for the last 1.5 years I always end up driving right by this place.  After some discussion with my wife last night, we decided to order pizza for carryout.  We do not normally go to Venezia's for pizza.  We ordered a large Park Avenue pizza.  The pizza was good, but there are other places in Mesa AZ that we believe make pizza a little bit more the way we like it.   The pizza we ordered was good though.    As we were talking about this, we kind of both realized that perhaps both of us had been to a Venezia's pizza before.  My wife works in North Scottsdale and remembers going to a Venezia's for lunch with her colleagues from work.  Me, about 1 year ago, when I first started at my current job in NE Mesa, I remember coming to this exact location with my colleagues for lunch, and ordering two slices of Buffalo Chicken Pizza.    Anyway, the pizza was good.  It is just that we (my wife and I) know of other places in Mesa where the pizza is more suited to our tastes."}
{"text":"Tried it 3 times and was disappointed each time.  The pizza is very underwhelming.  I was really excited to have a new pizza place in the area, too.  It's too bad."}
{"text":"Being in Phoenix, this \"New York Style Pizza\" is pretty darn good. We ordered the Italian Stallion and a Caesar Salad via Uber Eats. The food was prepared quickly and was as tasty as it gets. I usually also judge a pizza by how good it is leftover and cold - Venezia's passes that test with flying colors as well.  I'll definitely be ordering from here again soon."}
{"text":"Sorry for the long story...my husband and I moved back to the valley and after unloading our Uhaul truck we decided to do takeout from a place we missed. I looked up Venezias in Yelp and ordered the pizzas. When we got there we were hot, sweaty, exhausted, and hungry. But turns out I ordered from the wrong Venezias. My husband apologized for me and explained we just moved back were tired and made a mistake and asked how long if we wanted to wait for pizzas. We were given a cold drink while we waited, our order was cancelled at the other Venezias and they rushed our order and got it to us in 10 minutes. Pizza was amazing and it was nice to be reminded of their wonderful service. Thank you for the great welcome back to Mesa. We will be coming in to eat again and again!!"}
{"text":"Three things sold us: Breaking Bad, Food Challenge, and Pizza.  The original store is located in NM and was seen twice in the AMC show, so we were stoked when we saw that there were four locations around Phoenix for us to choose from.  We decided to try the two person Food Challenge, eat their entire 24\" Party Pizza in an hour.  Thankfully, they do slice the pizza, unlike the joke on the show.  We fell short of the challenge, but really loved the whole experience.  Despite the gimmick, the pizza is amazing.  Since leaving NY, we've been looking for this type of crust and were amazed to find it so far south in the desert; the crust has a perfect rise, doughy yet with a bite from being slightly caramelized during the bake, and not too greasy.  Their pies have fresh toppings and a perfect sauce too.  Our only suggestion for the restaurant is for them to serve draft beer.  We noticed that they have some taps, but none of them were in use.  Thankfully, they do have some inexpensive daily deals on their bottled beers.  You can even grab a bucket of ice to keep your bottles cold at the table and chilled glasses.  Some of the other reviews about their customer service worried us at first, but we thought that they employees were very friendly and professional.  They don't really have table service though, which is starting to be a trend in a lot of restaurants.  You order your food at the counter, take a number, and they'll bring your order to you."}
{"text":"Great pizza and reasonable prices. If not THE best, one of the top 2 or 3 in Mesa. Love it! I can't comment on any of their other food, we never seem to pass up the pizza."}
{"text":"Just tried them to check them out. Yuck !! With other places around like ISA and Crust., This place is worse than Little Ceases or Domino."}
{"text":"Everything I have ordered from Venezia's has been delicious! Their delivery is always fast and their customer service is outstanding. When there was a mix up with one of my orders, they immediately corrected it and threw in extra food to make up for the inconvenience. I could not ask for better food or better service."}
{"text":"This place has great pizza and salad. I'm not a big eater so I love getting pizza by the slice. The staff is really friendly too. I will be back for more."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery since I'm staying in the area and was pleasantly surprised! Arrived way earlier than the estimated delivery time and was delicious ! The wings had a good flavor and heat to them and the pizza was cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in our area.  Our previous address was one street out of their zone and they still delivered.  Just got their Tuesday special, great deal.  I had a credit that they reminded me of.  Jordan my delivery guy was polite and professional.  keep it up!"}
{"text":"The only reason I kept coming back is because I like their hotwing pizza. If it wasn't for that pizza I would have already gone elsewhere. The food is always pretty good as long as they can get your order right. I had to tell the manager last time that its always something with this place... First time I had gone there they gave me someone elses order, They made it right but I had to drive back there which nobody really ever wants to go back. 2nd time I asked for honey hot wings, which they told me they had... Nope... They doing have those, so without asking they just gave me hot wings. 3rd time I paid online and showed up to pick up my order, the girl behind the desk voided my charge so I had to pay for the pizza again. They really only charged me one, but I had 40 bucks pending on my card for 5 days, which that gets super annoying... Last time I went there I thought everything was perfect. I took the pizza home, opened my box and it was exactly what I ordered... My daughters cheese on the other hand.... It looked like they had violently shoved the pizza in the box and then roundhouse it and the dropped kicked it. There was cheese everywhere stuck to the box inside. There was no way this happened from me driving it home. It was redonkulous! There are a couple other bomb pizza options in the area. I may have to throw in the towel after what looked like a pizza homicide had taken place in that box. Ill give it 2 stars because when doe right the pizza is good.."}
{"text":"You talk about a humongous pizza, and you can find it here in Venezia's.  The size of the pizza represents how big a heart the chefs put into every portion of the pizza.  They have many original flavors, but also some specialties such as pesto chicken, BBQ chicken, and much more.  You can also order by the slice or get a combination of pizza(s), salad, and drink.  I have tried the BBQ chicken and Pesto Chicken, and each time I want more, but I am just ridiculously full right after!"}
{"text":"Looks wise, pizzas look very good.  Ends there!  My pepperoni pizza had NO flavor at all.  The cheese and pepperoni were tasteless.  The WORST was the dough/crust, which was fairly thin.  So I was quite surprised it was like chewing on a thin piece of leather.  TERRIBLE.  ADVICE:  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE.  Barro's is MUCH better!!    Consider yourself WARNED."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in Phoenix! My boyfriend and I go almost every single week for either a full pizza or just a slice. Their single slices are cut from a gigantic pizza and the combos are well worth what you pay. Their sandwiches, wings, and other sides are all fantastic as well.   One of the best parts is the consistency. Other pizza places I have gone tend to randomly disappoint me, but Venezia's is always perfect. They also don't add sugar to their sauce like many other places."}
{"text":"Venezias + GrubHub = Problem Solved.   Pizza isn't usually my first choice but today it was an excellent way to go.  And the greatest thing, its like sharing is caring... so it fed many and filled my urge for a hot pepperoni crispy pizza pie in the eye."}
{"text":"Tried the crust-less pizza bowl (pesto chicken style), and it was great! I typically opt for the crust version at Venezia's as it's a great pie, but this is a great option for those on a lower carb diet.   Great staple of the north phx pizza scene!"}
{"text":"Came back here to retry the pizza with the manager giving credit for a large one item.  We ended up getting a medium meat lovers and an order of wings.  Meat Lovers Pizza was very good and cooked perfectly and the wings were as good as before.   It was a Wednesday Night and not to crowded so it was an overall nice evening of dining in the restaurant.   Will probably be back."}
{"text":"Best pizza in this area by far...!!! I prefer here over all the basic Pizza Hut, Domino's, Papa John's ect.... When ever I order pizza I order from here now. The price is ok."}
