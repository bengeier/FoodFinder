{"text":"Not my favorite dive bar, but I definitely see what people really dig it. Copacabana is great for sitting down at a table and sinking a few pitchers of beer with your friends.  Also, their kitchen serves up some surprisingly good Indian food for a dive bar. The pakoras are some of the best I've ever had.  I'd recommend Copacabana for a pre-night-out snack and pitcher any time -- but I'd stress the importance of moving on if you're looking for some real action."}
{"text":"Checked out this bar on Saturday afternoon.  Forgot the bartender's name but he was cool peoples.   Told my friend and I about the nightlife, little bit of the culture of the city, some places we should visit, things like that.  We returned later that evening to a nice packed bar(25-35 people). People playing Poole, music on the joop box, very much  a dive bar atmosphere but awesome time all the same."}
{"text":"I came here late on a Saturday night, and while I generally love a dive bar like this, it was weird that it was so sparsely populated on a busy street like Saint Laurent that it made me think that this would be a better place to check out during the day when there weren't hordes of drunk people on the streets.   I loved that the tie-dye-haired bartender referred to my lime capirinha as \"straight poison\", and it was great. The only thing that honestly worried me was that the few patrons that were already there were so drunk and angry with one another that I thought a bar brawl was about to go down. And with only two small bartenders there, I just didn't want to be a part of the fray so I bounced quickly.   On the whole, lovely service and a good drink, but got a bad vibe and would return at more sobering hours, with hopes of a better review."}
