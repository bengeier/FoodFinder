{"text":"Love Paintlounge! It is a wonderful opportunity to do something unique and let your inner artist out! Staff are very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Joey is a great instructor of workshops.  He has provided great tips and techniques making a complicated painting easy to complete."}
{"text":"Returning customer here, with more good news. My experience at Paintlounge has been consistently awesome and I keep seeing the founders around the community, keeping their hands on Markham's faint but persistent artistic pulse. 

It was one of my 2012 resolutions to stop by and paint here so my friend and I took advantage of their Christmas deal to grab a canvas gift for each other for $25. We settled down for four whole hours and painted until rolling insanity took over, painted some more, then declared our pieces finito! 

The staff was pleasant and extremely helpful and helped my newb friend discover some hidden artistry. We also took advantage of their coffee and tea selection. 

My minor beef is that my cappucino was slightly too milky, but I am a coffee snob. Of the snobberiest variety, so it really wasn't so bad. The desserts looked so delicious I was hard pressed to resist vacuuming  some up into my face, but willpower prevailed over my id.  
 
Another lovely experience and looking forward to doing another faux Rothko in the new year!"}
{"text":"Bought this Groupon for date night on a Friday evening, didn't read the fine print but figured when it said one drink was included and that you had to be 19+ to attend I figured it meant it was an alcoholic beverage... instead they don't sell alcohol and the 'drink' was a coffee or a tea. On the bright side There is a bar next door but you Can't bring alcohol over because they don't have a alcohol permit. Class was a bit disorganized."}
{"text":"Great experience! and I will go back again and this is why: 

The last time I drew something was in my grade 9 art class...I am not creative at all and in fact, as soon as we planned to visit this place, I started to get paranoid of what I should draw.

I'm still drawing blank in my mind the moment I stepped in and after they set-up the canvas in front of me. The owners are encouraging, kept telling us that you don't have to know what you want to draw, ideas will slowly come in as you pick up the brush. They were showing us what their their customers have drawn and how they did not plan ahead and ideas just hit them naturally on the spot. Guess what, they were right!  

Overall, it was a really great night, I had lots of fun and I think it is hard to believe if you are not an artsy person to begin with, you just need to give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Went to Paintlounge for my birthday last year with some family and friends and I had a great time! We were surprised to find out what creativity and talent we all had. 

The lattes were yummy and the staff were very friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend Paintlounge to anyone!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! Me and some friends came for their 2 for 1 tuesday promotion. It was $15 for an XS canvas which is 18 by 18 inches. 

There are a lot of resources, things like guides on how to mix paint for certain colours, stencils, sparkles, and lots of books with cute designs in them.

The ladies there were really nice, always checked up on us to see if we needed anything and showed us many examples and techniques we could try. 

They also have a mini cafe there, i had a tea to accompany me while painting. Overall it was a fun experience!

I plan on going to some of their events in the future! this thurs they are having a make-up workshop where u can make your own lip balm and in march they have one where u learn how to design cupcakes!"}
{"text":"I came to paintlounge for a birthday party. In the beginning it was a bit rocky as they had double booked but they made up for his by offering complimentary drinks and allowing my friend to stay longer than the allotted time so she can have a good experience. I must say, I am no artist but I did enjoy myself. It was fun doing something out of my element with good company. While I do not think this is a place I would go again on my own (painting is just not my thing), I did enjoy my time there and the experience."}
{"text":"Love the concept and the experience. Went for Valentines Day and it was nice to see so many other couples enjoying the experience together as well. They have a special on for the day. The only problem we had is that the staff were a bit cold and not very helpful. In an environment like this, where I was a new painter, it would have been nice to have a little motivation. Didn't damper the experience though and we will certainly be going back! Planning all the paintings we want to have around our house."}
{"text":"I always love painting but it was just too hard for me to find a right place to do it in Toronto, where you can paint, enjoy the treats and delicious beverages at the same time. I got there a few weeks ago, my gf and I was thinking about what to do after the dinner and we just happened to be in the same plaza, saw a few people painting inside and we decided to give it a try. It was definitely a wonderful experience, the owner is very friendly and helpful, we picked a canvas and it took us about 1 hour to finish everything up, we took the painting home and it's hanging on our washroom wall. We will definitely go back next time when we are in the area! great place!"}
{"text":"Had the best time here painting last night. Haven't tried the workshops, but will be back to buy a canvas for sure. Everyone who worked here was really nice, too. I'm an artist!!!"}

{"text":"I've never painted in my entire life (except in elementary school, but does that count?). This was my first time painting and I loved it! You get to choose a canvas for a certain price and from that you can paint as long as you want as long as they are not too busy. The girl was very helpful as I didn't know what I was doing lol. I didn't try any of the food or drinks there but wil definitely try it next time."}
{"text":"About a month ago, I attended one of the \"Espression\" events at the Markham Paint Lounge location. It was a lot of fun! Combine good music, great company, paint brushes, and some drinks and it is sure to be a good night! 

Read my blog post about it here: http://www.tobakiss.ca/paint-heart-paint-lounge/"}
{"text":"Awesome! My 5 yr old and I had a great time, very knowledgeable staff, very patient, helpful and accommodating for March Break. We will definitely return with more friends."}
{"text":"AMAAAAAZING experience. Reminded me that there is a whole creative world out there. I went there for \"Live Expressions\", which occurs every 3rd Thursday I believe. It features local artists who play/sing live while you paint. It created an amazing atmosphere and I loved the music - it was serene and sincere. For $25, we got a good sized canvas, 2 drinks, and could paint for almost 4 hours. The best was how helpful and friendly everyone was that worked there. Highly recommended for a lovely relaxing evening out with friends. Also tons of great restaurants in the area to go beforehand too."}
{"text":"It wasn't the moment that I laid brush to canvas, it wasn't even when my canvas started to resemble the picture I had in mind. It was during the strokes, during my unbreakable concentration did I begin to feel something familiar; something that I've not felt for a long, long time. The feeling of utter disregard for the world around me, and being completely entrenched in the world that is slowly coming to fruition, with each decisive moment, nothingness becomes something tangible, but not completely within the grasp of definition. I knew that feeling once during my lessons in middle school #6 back in Qingdao while learning watercolours.
I come from Qingdao, the beer capital of China, and our number one pastime aside from drinking is painting. It took Paintlounge to remind me f that.

I picked an easel near where the food was easily accessible, and I don't remember stopping to grab anything even once. I was in a world of my own. I was in a realm where every dab of paint gotten me closer to somewhere that felt emotionally distant. That's my definition of visual art. Something immediate that inspires great coveting for emotional distance.

The place was small, and at the beginning I was afraid that I'd be crammed with strangers. But as I painted, the more enclosed I felt with what real estate I was given. I didn't mind. The staff came around with encouraging words.
A Samantha said she \"really liked\" my painting. I told her it was the original jacket design for The Great Gatsby. I felt pretty good about it.
Moments later, I heard her say the exact same about someone else's painting. It was like instant infidelity, and I have to say..I was slightly heart broken.
But YO..whatever, I'm a Man.

I remained standing for the duration of the event, as mostly everyone else did. I didn't see more than three chairs, so I am assuming that there isn't enough to match all the easels. I could be wrong. Not that it mattered, but if I was here for an entire day, chairs would be nice.
The staff here clean up after me, which felt really weird as I am accustomed to cleaning up after myself. At least after painting. It's nice for kids, but it felt unnecessary. I felt irresponsible, like leaving the dishes at the table after dinner at someone else's house.
Despite being served beer and wine, this place is not licensed. So they would have to attain an SOP from LCBO if wine is to be served. This is a hassle, but then again, it is kids friendly.
Not open Mondays. Monthly events with discounted prices.
Coffee, custom teas, latte, ice cream sodas, desserts.
Alcohol soon? Fingers crossed!

So, nobody knew my painting. Someone had to Google The Great Gatsby original book jacket. Not even avid fans to the novel/films knew!
It's not THAT far off!"}
{"text":"To release my inner Picasso, I've ventured to Markham, the recently established city north of the border from Toronto. In three short hours, it was revealed to me that my inner Picasso is actually more like a clueless Pollock.

In honour of the most beautiful woman I know, I've decided to secretly lay an abstract portrait of her on canvas. Secretly, because she is unaware of my appreciation of her beauty. Abstract, not because I'm creative, but that her fashion propensities rendered her often a living piece of art. So, it is not abstract after all, but a realistic painting of someone rather unreal. Long story short; I have no imagination.

Apparently, I was one hour early for their live music session where canvases were offered at a discounted price. The discounted price was offered to me anyway, which was good. I couldn't enjoy my iPod during my painting, which was bad--really bad. Free beverage on sessions such as this, so I ordered some pretentious latte that I can't recite the name of. To me, anything that's coffee with more than one sugar and crème is pretentious. The latte was delicious, and the excellent service made it sweeter. I began laying paint to canvas, and reminded myself that art was in the eye of the beholder, and since I had no plans to publicate my works, I continued to art.
Often, the staff here came to check on my progress. I asked for some advice pertaining to techniques, and they offered me somewhat helpful tips that I more forgotten than anything else. To be fair, this wasn't a learning workshop. Regrettable, because soon the music started.

It would be rude to plug in my ear buds, but bad music is equally offensive, especially when it's live and so adjacent. I am very particular with live music, and the act on was anything but particular. Two women took the stage; one behind her guitar, the other with only the mic. The lady acting as the supporting voice was tolerable, but the guitar girl vocalized chalkboard scratching noises for a full two hours. It didn't matter the amount of free beverages that was offered to her, no elixir on Earth could hydrate that voice. I centred myself, trying to enter any stage of inertia in attempt to phase her out. The one hour head start proved crucial to my focus, as the painting was starting to materialize before me, and I was able to concentrate on the beauty which I so highly bestow. Through this form of meditation that I've newly invented, I was able to render guitar woman as ambient noise. The obligatory applause after each song would throw me out of my trance, and so I was unable to finish my painting.
There is a $5 charge for returning customers wanting to complete their art, so I left my unfinished beloved in the hands of Paintlounge, who offer storage services for unfinished works.

The paint was discount brand, the brushes were economy quality, and a great deal of other painting utensils was DIY parts. Even so--with the guitar woman was taken out of the equation--I had a wonderful time despite coming by myself. The brownies and cupcakes were a bonus, and kept me centred. I guess that's why they call it soul food.

All great tragedies are significant emotions invested towards an unreciprocated source, but still I am determined to complete my work of art, so that at least a part of that beauty is tangible to me. I shall check the calendar for my next visit here. Not my calendar, Paintlounge's calendar, so I'd return on a quieter day."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times on both weekdays and weekends. It's fairly busy during the weekend but I've not had any issues with availability for a party of 2 or 3.  Canvas size ranges from small squared ones to big ones at $20+.  I only come here with some sort of promotion (buy 1 get 1 half off) which they tend to have fairly often. For the price (especially with discounts) it's a great way to spend a night in Markham as there's not many activities at night around here.  It's opened until 11pm and even later on weekends. 

I've been here before when it first opened and remember there used to be more resources for painting. For example there were crafty materials and glue guns which enabled you to make a mixed media painting. Now they no longer have any available and it's strictly just painting with regular paintbrushes/sponge/stencils. It's a bit disappointing because it limits the number of cool creative things you can do. 

Otherwise, there's a supple amount of supplies, though most paint brushes (probably due to multiple uses) have their tips cut off to an extent where there's hardly anything left on the paintbrush to paint with. 

Another thing that's different from when the store first opened is the menu variety. The previous owners (not sure if they still own the stores?) had an extensive menu with hot food like panini and a cool concept with tea where you get to pick and choose different things to put in your tea. Now there's only the regular coffee/latte."}
{"text":"We came to Paintlounge for Family Day, a group of 5 adults and 1 teen. They had a special where a group could paint a large canvas for $50. It was such a fun way to spend an afternoon! None of us are all that artistic, but enjoyed playing around and worked with the \"tree of life\" motif they suggested for family day. 

Nice atmosphere and the 2 people who worked there were helpful and unobtrusive. 

Would definitely come back with friends!"}
{"text":"I love the idea of this and I would definitely go if i had more time (and money) but this is great for parties or a quiet friday night activity with friends. Super cute, you can get some drinks there and they do workshops too. 

They provide all the material and all you have to do is buy a canvas and you can start. They also offer preloved canvases for 30% off which are paintings people left behind and they just reprimed it.

The people there are usually very kind as well, they let you be independent with your paintings but occasionally check in and give you suggestions to add to it."}
{"text":"Pros:  
- Pleasantly surprised by how clean, bright, and organized the space is. 
- There are plenty of easels, and there is a table with bulk dispensers of acrylic paint, brushes, and other tools that all the painters share.
- I can bring in my own canvas to  Paintlounge, and they will only charge for the materials 
- Good selection of music

Cons: (in my opinion, anyways)
- The staff was surprisingly hands off during the workshop. I felt that, as a beginner, I was not provided with enough guidance or pointers, particularly on techniques or how to prepare a good composition. My resulting painting looks rather childish.  The workshop is not the same thing as receiving painting lessons. They walk you through general steps which would hypothetically lead you to the finished product, but you are responsible for going up to the counter and asking them for help when you feel you need it. Sometimes I don't want to badger the person at the front, who already seems exasperated from explaining the same instruction to the multiple students. 

I will give Paintlounge another chance and go in for freestyle painting. The workshops are  OK, but rather expensive given that it was not as informative as I had anticipated."}
{"text":"Held a b-day party for my daughter here, all  the kids had a Blast. 
On my second visit,  my 9yo daughter had some trouble with her painting, and was getting very frustrated.  The young lady working there helped her fix her mistakes. My daughter ended up with a painting she is very happy with, and left the store with a big smile. 

Very friendly and helpful staff.... Highly recommend PA day activity!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great idea! Not many people, especially living in cramped quarters downtown, will have the room and dedicated space for an easel and painting accoutrements. This is where Paintlounge comes in. The staff are qualified artists and can help out and suggest ideas for your artwork and techniques to produce the look and feel that you desire. With a party organized like the Yelp event we had there, adding drinks and food help to relax people and get those creative juices flowing. This environment is difficult to achieve working at home with interruptions and distractions making Paintlounge a welcome alternative. All the equipment is there and it is well stocked with consumables, so no excuses, get painting!"}
{"text":"This place is such a refreshing spot in the midst of the wild and craziness of Markham. Who ever would have thought that combining gourmet desserts, loose leaf tea, coffees and painting would be such a hit! Well I guess if lattes and board games can work in Toronto then paint and tea can work up in the GTA. But such an unique concept will truly succeed in any market.

Made a quick stop tonight at Paintlounge to do some work. It was quiet (uncharacteristic according to the staff) but for me it was the perfect place for me to get some work done. After working for a little while, making full use of their free wifi I decided to take this place up on its claim to tea fame. 

They have an impressive selection of loose leaf tea and after looking over the menu I decided to try the Mango Black tea. One of the most interesting things was I was then asked what I wanted as a \"tea topping\". Puzzled I inquired and was informed that the tea toppings had one of several benefits; from stress relief to being good for your eyes. Being the end of a busy day I decided on the lavender tea topping to ease my stress.

The tea and tea topping was a beautiful marriage of flavours and I found it not only relaxed me but gave be a boost of energy that I needed after a hard day.

I didn't have time to paint tonight but knowing how tranquil this place was between the tea and the relaxing music I will return to turn my artistic flare loose on a canvass of choice (you can purchase different sizes depending on you level of ambition).

Great spot! Can't wait to return in the coming weeks :)"}
{"text":"Whether you're an expert artist or have talents that are better in fields other than art have no fear - Paintlounge is still the place to be to spend a night out with friends or family. It's spacious, accommodates a good number of people.

The staff here know their stuff - they're friendly and Are more than willing to offer advice, ideas and tips on how to make your painting whatever you want it to be.


They have little books with tons of pictures for inspiration- do take a look at them, especially if you have no clue what to paint.

I personally am a horrible artist, never took it after elementary school ( I did horribly, I might add).  I came here on two occasions, with friends and family. The first time, i had no idea what I was doing, no idea to what I was painting and just went with it. I had fun, the staff was so pleasant and helpful. Though my painting wasn't pretty, I still had fun making it - and it was a relaxing evening with a friend!

On my second visit, i came here with kids, and adults. It was fun for everyone, we all painted something different. It's relaxing and no one's here to judge.

Tip: come here with ample time for closing to spend a relaxing day
Also, if you aren't as creative, DO look at a picture for inspiration and recreate that incase \"going with the flow\" turns out horrible :P

I would do it again - even though i'm horrible at it. It's not too expensive, It's right on Main Street MARKHAM and its fun. The cheapest is about $22."}
{"text":"This review is meant to be highly useful to you as a potential customer of PaintLounge - the things I wish I knew upon my time at their \"expressions\" evening.  The expression evening is an event that you pre-purchase tickets for, and keep in mind they have a pretty strict cancellation fee.  The event is $28 including tax, and was touted as having live music, free style paint, and then you get two non-alcoholic drink tickets.  That was all the info we got.  They also tell you to get there at 7:15 pm because the event starts right at 7:30 pm.

Here is what I wish I knew:
- actually get there at 7:15 pm.  They have limited stools.  They really should ask you upon ticket purchase how many people are in your group, and then pre-select seats so you just stand at the easel they pick for you.  Instead, I would pick an easel, and the lady would come around and move me.  This was very frustrating, and a bit rude.  I didn't get there early so you could just keep moving me.  When she finally settled on where I \"could\" stay, another group asked us to move - all of this could have been avoided if they asked for more info upon ticket purchase.  They have a registration list, so it's not like they don't know who is coming.
- they have plastic bags you can put around your purse or personal belongings.  The coat rack fits very few coats, and no spaces for bags.  Don't want to get paint on anything
- they have pencils and erases so you can sketch what you want to paint before putting paint to canvas.
- they don't have decaf coffee options - pretty stupid for an event on a week night that starts at 7:30 pm and goes until 11 pm.  So if you don't like caffiene late at night, you are limited in your selections
- the music is really amateur. The whole event is amateur, but not in a bad way, just in a very \"local\" way.  The singer kept apologizing for things, and then they had the barista sing for a bit, and basically everyone who worked there took a turn singing.
- everyone is weird.  the people who are attracted to this type of event are very granola, and want to talk to you, and want to talk about art, and you may not want to.  I didn't want to.  Just don't, then.
- you actually will be there a long time, at least until 10 pm.

Here's the info they give you when you get there:
- here are the paints, here's where to put dirty brushes, there's a break at 9:15 pm to listen to original songs by the singer.  Two drinks per person.  That's it.  That's all they told you.  They do this at 7:17 pm, so if you aren't there then, it's a bit confusing.  

So, why 4 stars?  Because it was fun.  It was actually really fun.  I'm not an artist, I don't ever do \"arts and crafts\", but it was really enjoyable.  It could be a fun date night, it could be fun by yourself.  It was interesting and I felt like I got good value for my money.  I wish they had alcohol, but it wasn't needed."}
{"text":"Such a fun night out!!! They offer night event specials here which are a riot! They have fun music playing and offer drinks and food to enjoy as you paint the night away! really is a great time!! Price included the materials and canvas. I would highly recommend it for anyone who needs a creative outlet."}
{"text":"I had a really good time at this location. I planned one of my birthday celebrations here and it was a fun experience. We purchased the freelance package and all received teas and the supplies to paint a 16*20 inch canvas. The only thing I would do differently is I would ask for 4 hours of studio time if you plan on bringing food. I brought snacks and a cake for all of us and felt rushed in terms of painting our paintings, earring and enjoying dessert. With all of that aside the employees were super friendly and everyone had a blast. I would definitely go back to paint here with my friends."}
{"text":"Really cool place.  Samantha is the best teacher!"}
{"text":"Went in with my family and loved it. My 3 year old loved painting away and the variety of paint materials is amazing! Great place"}
{"text":"My friend and I purchased a Groupon voucher which was about $30 each. I loved the entire concept and the space itself. It was really fun, colourful and artsy. However, my experience here wasn't the greatest. Our instructor explained and showed things a little too quickly. For a first time painter I felt really rushed and stressed out. Even though the painting turned out okay, I didn't feel like I did my best.  I didn't enjoy the process of painting and creating something wonderful. I felt really left behind and the pressure to catch up and finish the painting was overwhelming. I felt like when I was back in college trying to finish that last minute assignment due at midnight. 

I felt so rushed I forgot I even had a free drink and I never got to claim it. 
I would definitely do another paint night but perhaps with a different instructor or different company."}
{"text":"This place was a lot of fun! We did one of the workshops here and the staff was super friendly. Very inspiring environment. One thing I noticed is they really take of their supplies, I've been to places where the brushes are caked in dry paint/ruined. They also clean up for you, no need to wash anything afterwards!"}
{"text":"Unable to color some painting book when i was a kid, this is one of my mum's fave childhood stories~ (embarrassing one for me of course) 
It took me a long time to admit that painting/drawing is some talent I just don't have. 

However, I still love this place. Staffs there are very friendly. They help you with all kind of questions. They also have books for easy painting ideas, so everyone can have fun.

I've never draw/paint  on a canvas before. I still did a terrible job, but when you start to put all the colors together. How good/bad your work is, It doesn't matter anymore ( at least to me)

So I am going back to take one of their work shops this Friday~~"}
{"text":"I had the best experience at Paintlounge. We hosted my birthday at the College Street location and had a blast. Our instructor, Sara was such a joy to have with my closest friends. Would definitely recommend dropping in, or booking an event here."}
{"text":"Used a Groupon and attended a workshop to paint \"Le Havre\". The Groupon provided a discount on the regular price to attend a workshop, and even included a free beverage. I ordered their mocha,  which was amazing aha! Despite there being a full class of 20 people, it was very organized. 

The moderator, Joey, was very enthusiastic and encouraged everyone to use their own creativity rather than trying their hardest to simply copy the original exactly. We were taught how to mix colours, guided through general steps of how to progress through creating the painting,  and he showed techniques to apply paint in certain ways, all of which was very helpful and made for a proud end result! :)
The workshop was scheduled to run from 7:30-9:30 but ran for about half an hour longer, that way everyone could finish their painting. 

I had such a fun time here, I loved hacing a night to dedicate to creativity and art; I am definitely interested in coming back again! :D"}
{"text":"Having zero artistic ability and never taken art in high school, I had a great time! Sure my painting was a work of 'contemporary art meets kind of followed instructions', it was great fun! We purchased a groupon for $25 each, it included a drink & they had delicious pastries from Nugateau. Our instructor guided us through the different phases of the painting - one thing he could have done better was not speak so fast? 

All in all, will come here again for a birthday or whenever I feel the urge to venture into my creative side again. For now I'll stick to my adult colouring books :D"}
{"text":"Purchased a Groupon and went with a group of 4 on a Saturday night for an instructor led painting class. Upon entry we were not greeted and we stood around awkwardly not knowing what to do. We were then given very brief introduction and was still kinda standing around until something started but we did get some tea and coffee and claim a seat. 

The class was pretty full and we had a female instructor we got was so sassy! I can't tell if she was in constant a bad mood or just extremely sarcastic either way I felt like she was a bit unfriendly and her instructions of how to paint were mediocre and the class was a bit disorganized.

They did provide all the materials like sponges and paintbrushes. and there is no clean up for you to do after, paint, have fun the leave! It was still an overall fun night because you get to paint but not something I would do often."}
{"text":"I bought a bunch of these Groupons when I had 20% off. Groupon was offering a paint class with a free drink for one person for $25. How I miss that deal.....
Some may find Paintlounge to be a great way to socialize with friends, but when I invite my friends to paint with me I end up tuning them out so I can focus on painting instead. To me, painting at Paintlounge is a great way to reset my brain and destress.
Each paint class is around 2 hours long and the teacher provides you with the instructions and all tools necessary to complete the painting that you signed up for. There is a station of easels with hair dryers to dry the acrylic paint on your canvas to speed up the completion of your painting, but even with the dryers I usually run over the 2 hour mark. This is where the free drink comes in handy because I don't need to leave to buy a drink. Their green tea lemonade is my go-to and it's great that they serve their drinks with a lid on it so you can't accidentally dip your brush into your drink.
They also offer drop-in sessions where you can swing by and freestyle. If you drop in with a canvas I believe the cost is around $10. If you need to purchase a canvas, I believe the session fee is embedded into the cost of the canvas.
One word of advice is to not wear your nice clothes to Paintlounge. I've never been able to leave a paint session unscathed."}
{"text":"Got a groupon deal here for a frds bday for $15+ tax. U have to book your class in advance online as they don't accept walk ins . It's great for a group of friends for social events. We did our beginner class but it was more like a medium level class. This is my first time here. My experience was pretty good as the instructor was very patient and good at explaining the techniques for all of us. There was about 20 people in our class. U need a lot of patience and time to actually master the technique of blending. The groupon deal provide u either a hot tea or americano drink. Your clothes will get dirty, make sure u wear black or something dark."}
{"text":"Getting in touch with my roots, Im glad the Paintlounge is here! Its a great place to experiment and test your artistic skills in a socially interactive  environment where people can meet or participate in a fun group paint session.
Woth rows of mounted canvases paintlounge layout is spacious and if you like, there's an option to order coffee, tea and latte. 
The only drawback to this place is the coat racks.... they need more! Especially on busy nights at Paintlounge."}
{"text":"Great place to sit down to some freestyle painting by yourself or with some friends!

They also have workshops available where an instructor takes you step by step to recreate their workshop painting. They encourage you to add your own artistic flair by mixing in your own colours or adding your own elements. 

No liquor as they are not fully licensed but they have a great self serve café bar with a variety of different teas and fresh brewed coffee and water. There's even hot chocolate for the kids available."}
{"text":"Exactly what you'd expect, painting and cafe drinks. Nice selection of teas, coffee was alright. The staff was very friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"I've been to all 3 Paintlounge locations in the city a few times and this one is my favourite.  It's not crowded like the one on College which is great because you have the freedom to move around and get your paint groove on.

I always feel inspired here, even though my paintings suck on a whole new level.  But beauty's in the eye of the beholder!  The space is bright and not jam packed with easels.  The staff are super friendly and will help you with any techniques you wish to try or give you pointers on how to achieve that Picasso masterpiece!

There is a small cafe where you can get coffees/teas/iced drinks.  I believe at events there is also beer (there was for the Halloween event that I attended anyways).  They supply all the paints, tools, paintbrushes etc so you needn't bring anything except your imagination!

Paintlounge gives you the ability to totally freestyle if you are that daring, or if you want to follow along with some of the suggestions in the multitude of books they have you certainly can.  There are specific workshops for techniques (abstract, drip painting, etc) and workshops on painting specific pictures.  Once a month each Paintlounge has an event where for $25 you can paint, listen to live music and get 2 free drinks.  Now seriously - what better time can you have in this city?

So tilt your beret to the side, pick up your paintbrush and let the artistic nature just flow through you to the canvas!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here - for the Espressions event.  It's a great experience for an amazing price.  You get to paint...listen to music...and get 2 drinks for under $30!  You can really let the inner artiste out as you put your brush to canvas!  The supplies are all therr with various brushes, sponges, paint tools to help you create your masterpieces.   They also offer books where you can draw inspiration from...or free form by just throwing paint on the canvas (generally my method).  This location is moving end of this month so check their site for their new address."}
{"text":"I booked a high school reunion here for 15 people and everyone had a blast. We decided to go with free form because we wanted everyone to each take home a different painting, but we could've gone with instructor-led too. 

With a huge selection of paint colors, brushes, and different inspirational photo albums to choose from, you could do a lot of neat tricks. However - My painting turned out to be pretty ugly, luckily I was on the lower end of the distribution and I should keep my day job - but there were some talented artists in the group inspired by Japanese anime or other unique styles! Not sure why they are accountants now, but I guess art doesn't pay the bills. That doesn't mean you can't express yourself with friends on a Saturday afternoon though

Tip! There's parking in the back!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place to come with a group, be it friends or meetup, or even better yet, a date! Or wait, even by yourself!

Don't expect instruction. The canvas are pricey if you ask me.
12x12\" or 11x14\" $20
16x20\" $30
18x24\" $40
24x30\" $45
24x36\" $55

I had no inspiration and just played with colours. But it was a fun time!"}
{"text":"I went here for their monthly live music event. The experience was overall a bit stressful. We arrived a 9pm and then told us they would close at 11:30 so we should begin, apparently the event had started at 7:30pm. I like the idea of social painting but found the enthusiasm of the staff a bit superficial. I hadn't painted in a long time and they kept on coming over and looking over my shoulder and making jokes or compliments- my painting was really not good and I was just trying to enjoy myself. I ended up feeling a bit self conscious. I would return if I had something I mind I really wanted to paint, and a plan. It was a cool place."}
{"text":"I wanted to try Paintlounge to see what the rave was all about. We've had friends who have done this and highly recommended it. We came with the intention of painting something to hang in our home, that wasn't the case, since it turns out we are horrible painters. However, the whole experience was great, as well the instructors were always there to help. It brought us back to elementary school days during art class. Lots of fun and will definitely return to try our luck at another workshop!"}
{"text":"Went for a Valentine's Day special and really enjoyed the experience!  I have not one artistic bone in me, so I was purely there for a laugh.  The space was a bit smaller than I expected, but it didn't feel crowded!  The staff members were friendly and offered advice and suggestions.  There are inspiration books if you have no idea what to paint.  Beverages were available as well.  I recommend painting with a glass of wine, makes it that much better!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to come for a birthday party. I booked my girlfriend's party here and we had an awesome time. The atmosphere is really relaxed and welcoming and laid back. Even people like myself who can't paint worth shit had a good time. Be aware that there's a $20 outside food fee if you bring anything in. 

Accessibility: flat entrance, washroom on the same floor (and it's huge)"}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon to try this place out with 2 girlfriends. Class was pretty much full on a Friday night. The painting we chose was a tad difficult with us being beginners. Overall enjoyed the experience. Place is a room with canvases set up and painting material. We got a nice hot tea as well which was included in the Groupon. They had different hot and cold drinks offered up at the cashier along with a few snacks you could purchase. I would go again for a night out with the girls. Brought my painting back and hung it on a wall."}
{"text":"Very friendly place If you are looking into hanging out with friend who want to do something artsy, the space of the location is good for group activitiy, they offer workshop for 45$ however u might be able to find special promotions on Groupon. AdditionAlly, if you don't finish ur painting u can leave it there with them for maximum of 7 days and u may pay 5$ extra to continue painting it next time. I witness the workshop, they would have a group of approx 10-15 people n the person who teaches will decide on what to paint and how to do it and show u techniques on doing them. Quite helpful and quite worth it if u want to improve in drawing or just want some ideas or inspiration. Overall, I find this place very warming n fun, staff were friendly as well. I enjoyed my time with my friend painting here, was quite relaxing and it made me get back on my art zone lol."}
{"text":"I loved going to the Paint Lounge. It's truly a different experience than the other amenities/fun things to do in Toronto/GTA. Typical hang outs for me usually involve eating (bubble tea, Korean BBQ, ramen...), so this was refreshingly different... not that I don't love food of course. 

I am personally not an arts major or any of the sort so I found the canvases and snacks to be a bit pricy. However, if you go on Wednesdays they have a 20% off discount. Also, be sure to give yourself adequate time to finish your painting as they charge an additional $5 to come back if you need more time to work on your painting (for another day). 

What I recommend is splitting a canvas with a friend/boyfriend/girlfriend and making a fun, interactive experience out of it. As I mentioned, I'm not artistic by any means... but that means you just need to plan a little more! We sketched out a rough draft which was easy to follow and relay onto the canvas. They also have templates of photos that you can copy/paint. 

It was really fun. I ended up snacking a little bit (which came up to $5-10) on a yogurt covered pretzel here, and something else there... I'd say overall, my bill came up to $30ish? A little steep in my personal opinion, but it was well worth it. I have a beautiful painting in my room now. =)"}
{"text":"I love this location!! Painting is so much fun and relaxing and the staff are great at organizing. I will be coming in to do a workshop in January. Thanks for being awesome"}
{"text":"Came here on a weeknight for a workshop. I had a real blast. The studio is very nice, bright, with lots of aisles, and a paint and brush station to grab supplies... the staff were friendly and gave me useful tips on how to blend my colors and encouraged me to experiment with different brushes. After three hours, I created my first master piece!  I felt like I need a bit more than 3 hours because I wasn't able to finish painting but that's okay. It was also cool to see how everyone was painting the same picture but everyone's painting came out differently with unique takes. I also like their drink and snack choices. I ended up with a red roobios and gnger tea which is delicious! I definitely want to go back and try another workshop soon!"}
{"text":"I've been somewhat interested to see what this is about and managed to get a Groupon which included a workshop and a drink.

Staff: They're very friendly and are available to make suggestions. I wished that since we were in a workshop that they'd provide more guidance. They only offered very basic starting points and for the most part we were left to our own devices. I was hoping to gain more technique on colour skills and paint strokes, instead it was a lot of \"mix until you feel it is right\". Now, I do understand that art is subjective though and a form of expression, so I get what they were going for.

Facilities: They have plenty of paints and brushes. It's quite messy, but what else would you expect? They provide plastic bags for purses and belongings which was much appreciated. They also had blow dryers to dry your art so it gets quite loud in their when everyone is using them. This isn't the most top notch quality in materials but it's definitely not dollar store quality either. I will say that the stools confused me because I didn't know if I could sit on them or if they were for my paints or both! I could've asked but it seemed like it would be such a silly thing to ask haha

Drink: I had the Lemonade, it was cool and refreshing, sweet and tart. I wish they were a little more organized with the drinks process because it was a lot of \"who ordered this?\" and multiple people would try to claim it.

Overall, I like the concept, but I think next time I'd rather freestyle than do a workshop since there doesn't seem to be too much of an advantage doing a workshop."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 4 & we used a Groupon. This place is a lot of fun whether you're a beginner or advanced. There's a cafe inside so you can sip on hot beverages as you paint. Our instructor was funny and great at explaining each step to us. They provide all the materials you need. I did the advanced Tangle scene even though I am at a beginner level (never painted before) but I was able to keep up with everyone else. We had a lot of fun and would do it again."}
{"text":"Great concept, great place. Wish them tonnes of success."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are not artsy people, and we went here to do something a little different.
We went for the abstract workshop - it was really easy to reserve a spot online - and we really had a great time. It's true that the instructors weren't typical instructors (ie, it wasn't a step by step class), but they were there if you needed advice on how to do a certain effect or what would happen if you did A and B together, etc. I personally really liked it like that. It meant him and I could laugh and joke while we attempted to paint our abstract masterpieces. You also have access to different tools and paint.

I had a really great time - I highly recommend it for anyone looking for something different to do in Toronto! We both left in a great mood and are planning to go back sometime soon."}
{"text":"I reached out Paintlounge a week ago. I had sent the rest of my family as a gift a month before. Recently my sister had passed away and I wanted to complete the set but only had limited time in Toronto before I left. 

Kevin replied back to me promptly and told me he was happy to help me out. He went well out of his way and made some time for me in another session. He also made sure to set me up with Laura who had taught my family's class before. 

Laura (and other staff) was wonderful. She was very understanding of the situation, attentive and helpful. She is a great instructor and also encouraged me on the types of ideas I had for my painting. 

I would recommend Paintlounge for any occasion. Thank you Kevin and Laura from the bottom of my heart. The experience and end results are very special to me."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday night for a paint workshop for my girl's bachelorette and it was such a great idea. They break it down for you on how to paint and then let you free reign on how to make it. The great thing about it is that you can paint it however you like. 

We got a groupon and it was half off the regular price. There is usually a groupon somewhere for a place like this. The staff were wonderful and we received a free drink in addition to the groupon. Try the green tea lemonade, its so good!!!! 

Although it got really frustrating painting as none of us were artists, it was such a fun girl's night. A definite must! This location was awesome, and I'd definitely come back!

Also if you want to bring outside food you can but it costs $20. I recommend not doing this as you're going to be so consumed in painting you won't have any time to eat lol (my friend didn't even touch her drink as she was so into it)."}
{"text":"I always thought a place that you could rent a paint studio would be interesting and yes it is. Tucked away in the South East Plaza is an interesting social lounge for anyone to try. It has interesting drinks along with easels you can rent to paint you masterpiece or just waste time together with friends. I went there in a party and it felt a little cramped but as long as you have less that a dozen, that should not really be a problem. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. 

I will have to try this place again some day."}
{"text":"A fun concept for people who have no experience painting and want to do something different maybe with a group of friends. We stood through a 15 minute lesson on how to paint a very innocuous landscape and then we were left to our own experimentation. I was asked once if I had any questions which I did not. I did, however, enjoy painting something other than my house for the first time in ages.

Taking a look at the pricing, I found it a little on the expensive side. Still, I come back to the thought that anything that encourages people to explore their creativity has gotta be a good thing, no?"}
{"text":"this was my second paint lounge experience. first one was in markham.
this is getting to be really fun. last time i went to a workshop, this time, it was an adult party event. so we could paint whatever we wanted.
the workshops are interesting because everyone is painting the same painting with their own spin on it, which shows a lot of personality.
this time around was just as interesting because everyone could pick their own inspiration. it was fun to see what everyone ended up painting and why. you could see the emotions behind it.
very fun activity, highly recomnend it. if you have a girlfriend. take her."}
{"text":"Went to the Oct 3 'Rain' workshop.
It was a perfect day for this workshop as it had been raining all day.
Employees were great. Taught the workshop very well, and were extremely positive. Something that I thought about after I left was how open they were to each person's interpretations of the painting. We could put our own personal spin instead of having to copy the example painting.
You don't have to be good at art. This would probably be the best place to go if you are new to painting or just want to try it out. Go with a small group of friends or take your girlfriend there. Depending on your boyfriend, he might not enjoy it though. Some guys are much too macho for art."}
{"text":"I really love hanging out there. Its such an interesting concept to go painting as a thing to do. You don't have to be an artist or know how to paint at all, all you gotta do it jump in and try it. See what comes up on the canvas. Its a great night out if your looking to be a little adventurous, its really just a great way to spend time together with your special someone."}
{"text":"Tom Kelley, the author of Creative Confidence suggested that all humans have an innate ability to be creative. Everyone in kindergarten considers him or herself an artist. This belief dwindles because most have a fear of judgment. 

Paintlounge is a safe space to build creative confidence. I had attended an awe-inspiring event at Paintlounge, thanks to Yelp. The space is beautiful. Typically, all materials required are provided with a purchase for a canvas. The staff briefed us on various painting techniques and provided tremendous support throughout the process. Grace and her colleagues were exceptionally attentive. Grace was an inspiration! She has a background in teaching and a deep passion for art! Social painting is a lot of fun!

During my commute home, several people have inquired about the painting. It was pleasure to have the opportunity to advocate Paintlounge to others!  I hope this is a start to a more creative Toronto! :)"}
{"text":"Decided to try out this new paint workshop trend that has been going around and I have no regrets! My boyfriend even enjoyed it and wants to come back. We did the beginner paint workshop which was easy to follow and it even came with a free drink from the studio's Cafe. The staff is friendly and the environment is great to work in!"}
{"text":"Great place for team building activity or girls night out. 
A bunch of us came for the adult workshop. We got a Groupon for $25 which included the the workshop and a drink. I had a chai latte which was very good; took  while to get the drink though. 
I am not an artist at all. The workshop was easy to follow. Overall, it was a fun night out"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my time here. I am by no means artistic but this was a fun way to get your mind off of adult life (although figuring out how to paint what you want may end up stressing you out....) with friends/S.O. My friend and I popped in on a Saturday evening and decided to do freestyle painting. You could also opt to do one of their classes if you register for them in advance. The place is nicely organized and staff inform you about which canvas options you have, the tools, the paints etc. There's a special for September, you can B1G1 50% off for one of the canvas sizes (1 up from the small) so we split that for $25/pp in the end. 

They have plenty of books and reference materials for you to get creative with, and any artistic level is welcome. I can see how it'd be great for kids to play around too since they clean up everything and encourage you not to worry about washing buckets (as you'd be used to doing if you were at home). The staff are also there to teach and guide you if needed, and they give great input if you have questions on which color/how to start your masterpiece. 

I believe they also have a groupon so that is also a great opportunity if you want to save on some fun. I'd come back again and it's a cute thing to do downtown when you don't wanna shop or eat."}
{"text":"Love this place! I haven't done arts and craft since elementary school and this place really brought back my love for painting. 

I previously visited Paintlounge for a Yelp event. I enjoyed it so much that subsequently I purchased a groupon to try out one of the classes (Pink Eiffel Tower). The staff was very friendly, although in general, I did not find the class to be overly helpful. I actually had more fun in my freestyle session at the Yelp event.

Paintlounge provides all the equipment and tools that you need to paint, as well as inspiration booklets that you can use. I really had a fun experience and I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I am by no means an artist but painting here is a lot of fun.  For starters, it eliminates my least favourite parts of painting; the cleaning up, having enough/or right paint for a project and having the right tools.  You get three sized canvasses to choose from and for $5 can bring back a project on a different night to continue it.  The staff are friendly and there has always been a lot of space while I was there.   A fun way to spend a few hours even if you have no idea what to do with the final product."}
{"text":"I LOVE paint lounge. Everything about it. Over the years I've been here a few times! :). Come with friends for their birthdays.

This place is great. It's located on main Street Markham, on the west side just north of highway 7.

There's on street parking, but there's also a tonne of parking behind all the buildings.


This place is great, you basically by a canvas, they supply the paint, brushes, and easels.  They also supply expertise, aprons, and clean up.

You can pick a design to paint from albums they have at the shop, or bring your own.

They have workshops where you can join a group to paint one painting. The staff walk you through all the steps needed to make the painting. It's fun.

I've also been there when there's been bday parties, wedding showers, and bachlorette parties. It's also cute when a couple are obviously on a date and they share a canvas!"}
