{"text":"If the name of the restaurant has the word \"Shanghai\" in the name, try dumplings.

Was a little bit disappointed with some of their Cantonese offerings, but this isn't a Cantonese place.  It's like going to a \"California Cuisine\" restaurant and was mad that their collard greens weren't good.

Xiao Long Bao was  very good, but the skin could have been a little bit thinner.  But the Pot Stickers were a cut above the rest, crispy skin on the bottom, moist on the inside and even a little bit of soup like the Xiao Long Bao."}
{"text":"This place used to be a lot better but they recently increased their prices, changed their menu and offered a lot less meat in their dishes (and a sh$t load more noodles!) 

If you're looking to have a nice carb overload this might be a good place to come to. It actually looks pretty nice and the staff are friendly and attentive and try to cater to the business crowd (with their business lunch special for 2). Luckily for us interns, the lunch specials are also pretty cheap ($4.99-6.99 although now I think it's 5.99-7.99).

Also, if you're thinking of coming here for Xiao ling bao's don't bother. Asian legend is in the same plaza and Ding Tai Fung is only a 5-10 min drive away!"}
{"text":"Good Taste is located in the Commerce Gate Plaze @ Highway and Commerce Valley Drive, on the Markham side. The location ok, but parking can be a bit of a nightmare, since there are so many decent restaurants in this particular plaza that is fairly budget friendly.There is underground parking, but beware the stairs leading up to the street level, it does smell quite back of garbage, which is very off-putting.

The food here is ok, but I like their pan-fried buns (sang gien bao) and their savory Soy bean soup (ham dou jeung) is pretty good. Their savory soy bean soup is about as good or slight better as the one produced by Asian Legend, located in the same plaza. Their Xiao Lueng Bao is ok, but I prefer the one that is done by Asian legend. Their Choi fan is ok, but I did find that my mouth had a bit of that really dry mouth affect, so maybe a bit too much MSG in the food.

I've come here before, mostly for dinner and Shanghai-style dim-sum. They have small to medium sided tables mostly at the front, and then two large tables at the back for dinner, so if you are going to be partying it up for dinner, and you're around 10 people, best call ahead to make reservations. Usually their savory soy-bean soup is a must order for me, because it is a great balance of salty, sweet, and spicy and almost always hits the spot. Their Pan-fried buns are, also, worth checking out.

Service is pretty much what you expect at a fairly popular chinese restaurant, the pacing of the food is pretty fast, to the point where we ran out of room on the lazy susan, and ended up putting the food wherever we could find space. 

But overall a fun night out with friends, and shanghainese dim sum here is decent as well."}
