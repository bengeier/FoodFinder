{"text":"My order was placed by walk in . The wings were saggy and the fries were greasy. The customer service was terrible. I told them about my food they were making excuses on why it was like that. It took the lady several minutes to take the bad food and replace it. I could hear her complaining about making it over. I really hope that they don't give me any old food for complaining."}
{"text":"Ordered on grubhub thought we would try something new. Was trifling disappointed when it took 4 hours to get our food. Call after the first 2 hours of waiting they claimed they just got the order.  Called again am hour later and said the same thing. When we finally got our food it was not only over cooked bit yet some how cold.  None of the food we recorded was even edible.  Not to mention packaging was garbage might as well have just wrapped all our food in old newspapers."}
{"text":"I called ahead to order my food and for some it reason the price changed once I got in here. Attitudes were very poor. Didn't have anything on the menu so my choices were limited. Would only recommend if nothing else is open"}
{"text":"Delivery took hour and half. They bread their wings!?! Don't bread wet wings!!! The buffalo sauce was spot on but the wings were ruined by nasty, soggy breading. Makes one wonder if they've ever even tasted their own food. Polish boy was just okay. Used hotdog bun instead of a heftier roll. BBQ sauce tasted more like ketchup. Pork chop sandwich was just a chicken fried pork chop with the bone left in and tossed on top of two slices of bread. Nothing on it. Nothing. Zero creativity at this place."}
{"text":"i often go there for the fried pork chop or perch sandwich.  my sister likes the wings.   very slow service, and the owner who i believe is also the cook has the personality of a waffle.  she really does cook good food but she needs to be a bit more personable to her customers.  she is friendly to the homeboys that drop in but that's it."}
