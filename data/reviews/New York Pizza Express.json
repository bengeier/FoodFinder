{"text":"I'm a huge huge fan of pizza, and very familiar with all types of pizzas coming from N.Y.  I do have to say by far the BEST pizza I have had while living in Charlotte. I've gone to numerous \"N.Y. Pizza spots around\" But nothing like New York Express pizza. The owner is amazing, I felt like I was back home visiting a friend. I alway order a Large Pep well done!"}
{"text":"One of the best Calzones I've had in a long time!!!

We are traveling and in Charlotte for the week.  Had a hankering for some form of take-out.  Looked up Yelp and found NYPE a mile from the house we are staying at.  Walked in and was hoping I would not hear \"Hey Y'all, how you doing\" and we were not disappointed.  Owner was present and had New York all over him.  AWESOME!!!  
Looking over the menu, changed our minds from the original pizza that we came in for and changed to the Calzones.  One of the employees showed me a Calzone she was boxing up to answer my question of if it was a \"real\" calzone or one of those folded pizza's that some places put out as Calzones.
Placed our order and sat down and within 10 minutes, 4 marvelous Calzones were on the counter awaiting.  
We get to our \"base camp\" and pass them out to the family and I am more than pleased in the texture and the flavor of these Calzones.  The crust was firm but not hard as a rock (we could cut them with the plastic knife and forks we were using) and the sauce was just right for dipping.  
Large portions and prepared just right.
Pricing is good for what we received.  In Chicago, it would be a lot more.
Clean and neat waiting area.

Overall, if I'm back in the area, I'm going to get another Calzone from New York Pizza Express.  I wish I had Calzones this good where I live in Illinois..."}
{"text":"Very good classic New York pizza. I would highly recommend it. If you want to get the best pizza possible make sure you order light sauce. They tend to over do the sauce sometimes but overall great pizza place."}
{"text":"No thank you. I got a medium 3 topping and this pizza was very bland to me. from my first bite it was missing something...flavor.  Service was ok. I could have made a better one on my own...or just went to papa johns. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Solid pizza for a great price. I wouldn't exactly call it ny style but more so than others that make that claim. Fast delivery as well"}
{"text":"The best NY style pizza I've had in NC!  It may seem a little pricey in comparison with Domino's or other pizza chains but you get what you pay for.  Delivery is fast and non-pizza items are good as well."}
{"text":"Authentic New York pizza. Better tasting than most. Super friendly staff who always seem appreciative of their customers. Convenient location."}
{"text":"This was our first time ordering. It took an hour and 15 mins to get our delivery (when they said it would be 45 mins). Not a fan of having to wait so long but the pizza was very good and we'll order again. I guess we will just have to order earlier next time to make up for the long delivery time."}
{"text":"These guys definitely know how to make a good pizza. The crust is the perfect blend of chewy with a hint of crunch, totally foldable and delicious! Not only do the make a good pie, they do it quickly, even when it's busy, and get it to your door still hot and tasty. They've officially made it into my phone contact list!"}
{"text":"Great deal and very tasty! The crust could be a little more crispy, but overall great experience. The guys at the shop are cool, you get your food quickly. Will definitely be returning for more."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have had being down her in North Carolina from new your Its so good and the owner is very very nice alone with the staff! My aunt showed us this place and so happy we found it!"}
{"text":"I have only had this pizza 3 times since moving to NC cause they are kind of far from me. Always amazing though! I love love love this place!"}
{"text":"They do take out and delivery! The pizza is tastier than most delivery places. The 10\" is a good size for an individual pizza. The staff was a lot of fun to chat with and answered any questions we had. We will definitely be getting food from them again."}
{"text":"One of the best tasting pizzas around. Not quite NY pizza but soooooo good!  Whenever my family comes to town they always ask if we can get pizza from there."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, and every time is delicious.  I usually get the Hawaiian or the Supreme.  Yes, it's more expensive than a chain pizza place, but you're paying for delicious, cheesy quality and top-tier toppings.  The staff are friendly and accommodating, and the wait time is short."}
{"text":"Love this place it's always delicious. Delivery is always on time and PIZZA IS HOT!!! I've ate here for about a year and I love the price for the quality. It us the closest to new York style pizza in these parts."}
{"text":"I got 2 pizzas from here. They ripped me off. I paid over $20 for 2 large cheese pizzas. I seriously could've got better quality and quantity at little Caesars.. The guy also lied to me when I asked for crushed red pepper and told me he had no more. I KNOW he lied to me. I hate establishment that don't care about the customer experience and just want to rip you off. They don't even have a restroom for customers! That tells me \"give me your money and get the hell out we don't care about accommodating\" Crappy pizza place."}
{"text":"Take out - No dine in - Friendly staff - Very good Pizza, better than most!  Fast, fast, fast service, great quality, great taste!  Ate here (in there parking lot) Sunday night!

I'm almost sure the Cheese they use is 100% Mozzarella (instead of a blend) I am a Fan of this Pizza with EASE!  If they were located closer to me I would be getting more Pizza from them vs Fuel!"}
{"text":"This pizza is mediocre at best. Not really a NY style pizza - the crust is soggy, they finely chop the toppings - definitley not worth getting excited over."}
{"text":"I wasted nearly twenty bucks on the driest and most boring white pizza ever! The whole dinner was nothing but a downer. Plus the sample we got was way undercooked, after eating the first slice we decided to bake it for another five minutes.

Once reheated the crust wasn't bad, not soggy or cardboard like but way thick for an alleged NY pizza. The topping unfortunately didn't get any worse or better for it, it was as solid as it was bland.

The only reason I'm giving it two stars rather than just one is that I suspect their plain pizza is better than average for this forsaken area. 

You've been warned: in Matthews-Stallings 5 stars amounts to just average out on in the modern world, and 4 stars here translates to \"it's pretty much crap but we have no better\" ."}
{"text":"The last couple of times I've ordered from NY Pizza Express my food has been horrible. The pizza is very soggy and the salad is brown and mostly inedible. The workers are always nice but that doesn't make up for the fact that the food quality is awful. I don't know what's changed in the last year or so but something definitely has. Prices have gone up and quality has gone down."}
{"text":"My family actually prefers this place to other pizza places in the area - or did before they stopped serving the onion rings! This place had some of the best onion rings, but mysteriously, they stopped serving them! 

The pizza here is a lot like NJ/NY pizza. Cheesy with a crisp/bendy crust. The pizza really is very good. The mozzarella sticks are great also. 
Please bring back the onion rings guys!! The meatball and chicken parm. sandwiches are VERY good. Great bread too.( the meatball sub could use a few more meatballs but is still delicious)

We still love ya and will order from you often!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed that they don't have an online menu.  Of course, after i had placed my order, I did some digging and found one on www.urbanspoon.com 

I got delivery-  they dont do individual slices, so I got the pepperoni mini pizza (8in.) and small side salad.  That wasn't even enough to fulfill the $10 minimum!  $6 Say whaaaa?  So I added breadsticks to make the order $12 including tax.  Perfect portion for one person, slightly greasy, but it's pizza, people!  The breadsticks had this addictive garlic/Parmesan butter mixture that I kept licking off the wax paper (hey! judgement-free zone here!) and the marinara was thick and not too sweet.  Luckily they delivered to my hotel relatively quickly- I felt like I was withering away in my (100 count sheets, I swear!) hotel bed with visions of mocking, dancing pepperoni swirling in my head...

  I would recommend NY Pizza Express for a quick cheap bite.  Next time I will try the calzone."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this location and it was quite good. We got a medium pepperoni and black olive pizza, and a large Italian sub fully loaded for $20.75. We had a Groupon for $10 towards $20 worth of food so technically we only spent $10.25. However, for the amount of food on the quality $20 is reasonable.

The pizzas what you expect from a New York style pizza place. Thin crust light sauce and a pretty good amount of pepperoni and black olives. Not too much cheese which is fine for us, but if you like cheese get extra.

The Italian sub was the winner of the day. We got everything on it and it really was everything!! The quality of the meet was good and the toppings along with oregano really completed the flavor profile.

The Groupon required that one sit down inside to eat,however this is a carry out or delivery place only. When we use the Groupon the person working inside didn't give us any hassle. Overall the experience was great."}
{"text":"First time trying NY Pizza Express tonight, and I am very glad I did! 
Found a menu online to have a look at prices, very reasonable, actually I was surprised at how cheap they were. We order 2 large pies, one just mozz, the other sausage & bacon, for delivery on a Saturday evening. They gave us a 30-40 min time estimate, and were in my driveway no more than 20 minutes later! Good friendly service both on the phone, and from the delivery driver. 
Pizza was great, nice slightly chewy crust, thin, but  not too thin. Good amount of sauce, and cheese tasted very fresh! It was really good. Super happy to have tried this place, now I just need to try their subs, calzones, and everything else! 
Thanks NY Pizza Express!"}
{"text":"I am a new York girl been in charlotte for 30 years and I must say it sure does beat flying home just for pizza! I do love this pizza the gravy is great thank you so much for the great food the great and wonderful staff!"}
{"text":"The menu is simple but the pie is great. It's hard to find anything around Waxhaw so it's nice to have a go to spot. My orders are always ready in 15-20 minutes. Pepperoni and pineapple is a great mix. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Is it the best pizza I've ever had - no. BUT it is, by far, the best pizza I can get delivered to my house in SE Charlotte. It's nothing fancy, but the crust is very good, the sauce is decent, and the cheese and toppings are fresh. That is more than I can say for some of the more highly regarded pizza places in Charlotte. They deliver fast too. We had my daughter's birthday party at Squirrel Lake Park and NY Pizza Express delivered a pile of pizzas piping hot and right on time. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Very good pizza!  This is usually our \"go to\" for pizza when the kids aren't around (they prefer Pizza hut) .  Pretty authentic NY Style pizza although a little bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"I had passed this place hundreds of times and never stopped in. This time I did just to see if they sold by the slice. They did! We got a pepperoni slice and a calzone and it was DE-LI-CIOUS. Like holy crow, if I had known how good it was when I lived here I would have gotten it all the time!!! Plus the owners are so friendly and accommodating. I absolutely loved it and will be back the next time I am in town!!!!

PS. Crust is amazing"}
{"text":"Websites says delivery within a 5 mile radius.  Stayed at the Hampton Inn on US 74, 4.3 miles away according to Google Maps.  Was told that they don't deliver that far, in such a tone that implied I was stupid for even calling.  

Why advertise lies on the website?"}
{"text":"My husbands go to for pizza delivery in the Matthews stallings area. We always get pepperoni and mushroom and it's always quick, hot, and tasty."}
{"text":"Great place! Good pizza that tastes great and is very authentic! We had a mushroom and sausage and we were very impressed. You won't be disappointed!"}
