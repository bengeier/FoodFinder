{"text":"We were walking around the village on a VERY quiet Wednesday evening and decided to try Brooklyn's as it was a new option for us.  We ordered wings and a white pizza.  Wings were okay - average.  White pizza was average as well.  Our server was okay as well.  The problem was the wait - the place was dead, with only 1 other table besides us.  We waited exactly one hour for our food.  When the food was delivered, the pizza was a personal size instead of a large.  They did leave the personal size so our kiddo could start eating, but we then had to wait for the large to be made.  It took absolutely forever.  Also, the garlic knots were not available, which was a bummer.  We won't be back because of the long, long, long wait.  Hopefully the owner will make the changes he needs to make in order to last in the village.  They did give us a \"locals discount\" which was appreciated, but the $2.00 discount wasn't enough to make up for the wait."}
{"text":"Friday night. Only 3 tables occupied. 5 guys in the bar. Lots of wait staff on. Walked in. No one to greet us. Hung out talked to another customer. Finally someone came and seated us. Do you want water? Yes please. Wait. Wait. Wait. Water! Would you like a drink? Yes please. Wait. Wait. Wait. Drinks!! Would you like a few more minutes? NO! PLEASE. We are ready to order. Order. Wait. Wait. Wait. Food! It was good, better than average burger. Wings a bit hotter than described, but good. Service sucked. First week in business however, there is no excuse for slow service in an empty restaurant with 4 or 5 wait staff hanging around. Dubliner's Pub is a staple in the village, food and service is always great. Brooklyn's is going to have to up its game with locals if it is going to survive (as many have not before). Word of mouth is powerful, and slow service will not bring people back even with good food."}
{"text":"White pizza was good, great crust. The sandwiches are  big, great Brooklyn themes and the server Barry was good"}
{"text":"Wings are good. Pizza, not so much. Potato knish is spot on, delish. Burgers, just ok.  Sandwiches good. Onion rings, awesome.  They were out of a lot of things we wanted to order. Service is slow, but our waiter was great.  They need a greeter or something, its not a very inviting place, it seems like your walking into a private place that really doesn't want you there. It has a depressing dark interior, but at least you can sit outside.  Now for the very very worst part and why I gave a 2 star.  The bathrooms are upstairs, no problem, but the upstairs is like a dirty warehouse.  If thats where your bathrooms are, at least make it presentable.  Then the VERY worst part is the ladies room.  No toilet paper, but someone, management or customer, put napkins on the floor for toilet paper.  Toilets were all dirty, trash on floor, mirror filthy, sink disgusting.  It was the middle of day, only two tables, so they need someone to check bathrooms."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by last Friday.  As residents of Lake Las Vegas, we were thrilled with having a new restaurant open in the village.  We were not disappointed.  The food was excellent.  The fried pickles were a tasty little treat.  My wife's calzone was excellent and my white pizza was superb. The bar did not skimp on the wine portion as I was getting wine by the glass.  I like beer but I like wine better.  If you are a fan of beer this is really the place for you, as they have multiple options.  The wine choices were adequate, perhaps not for a wine snob, but that's not me.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  The owner stopped and chatted with us for a bit as well.  I highly recommend taking the drive to Lake Las Vegas to give it a try.  A very comfortable, relaxing atmosphere with good food, drinks and service.  It doesn't get better than this.  We're so happy to have another great dinner choice at the village."}
{"text":"This placed has already closed, after being in business for only a couple of months (the doors are chained and there is an attorney letter taped to their door, stating they vacated their lease). It is very difficult to run any successful business at Lake Las Vegas (since Lake Las Vegas is like a ghost town the majority of the time)."}
{"text":"To be fair we tried this place three days after it opened. On the positive side the food was really good we had pizza and a salad and some chicken strips.  On the negative side are whole meal took over two hours we had no napkins no silverware the waitress was having a tough time serving all her tables and the pizzas just aren't big enough for the price.  We probably will try it one more time but will wait until more of the kinks are worked out."}
