{"text":"Friendly staff and very helpful for someone like me who is a bit overwhelmed with all of the options available for Asian cooking. After seeing some of these other reviews, we will certainly return to check out the other items noted. I did not realize this store was here, we don't usually venture this far toward downtown; we have just widened our walk and explore route to include this city block."}
{"text":"Coming from California, it can't compare to the Asian supermarkets in California. However, compare to the other Asian grocery stores in the area, this is definitely one of the best places to get Asian groceries.  My favorite thing about this grocery store is the wide variety of vegetables available at reasonable prices, and the frozen foods which are extremely convenient on busy days."}
{"text":"Every time I went into this place, a Chinese man looks like he's in charge would say something unpleasant to me, which makes me feeling horrible for spending one penny here! If you hate people then close the store!"}
{"text":"The Gist - small Chinese market good for basic frozen, some produce, snacks, rice, noodles, sauces. So happy to have a taste of home!   Why Go - Basic Chinese veggies, snacks & frozen food you can't get at the mainstream market. Also, dried Chinese herbs that your ma/grandma would use in soup. Some of the Chinese veggies pre-packaged and look fresher. Some of the fruit & other veggies def. not as fresh and would pass.   What's Not There - Sadly couldn't find the usual variety of tofu products found at Ranch 99, standard produce (i.e., tomatoes, carrots, bell peppers), no fresh meat   Grocery List - dried fish, miso, lilly bulb, bok choy, baby napa cabbage, cilantro, green onion, garlic, shitake mushrooms, rice, couple bags of frozen dumplings, shao bing, frozen lotus bun, frozen shanghai veggie bun, rice, soba noodles, mochi, redbean pancake, hosin sauce, soy sauce, soybeans, jasmine tea, couple caned goods ~$70"}
{"text":"Green-leaf vegetables & rice are much cheaper here. You can find almost every common food/flavour selling in China, even freezed dumplings. Get meat/potatoes/tomatos/onions next door in Wholey."}
{"text":"Great selection, good vegetables and fish. And labeled pretty well if you're an English speaker."}
{"text":"Ratings being relative, Lotus gets 4 stars for being the best Asian grocery store in Pittsburgh. But I still have to give them one star down for the times when I saw them being extremely mean to customers, even more so than what I'm used to in typical Asian grocery stores (dude, that's saying a lot).  Being a Vietnamese guy born and raised in Little Saigon, Southern California, my transition to Pittsburgh was a little rough. Being the typical student who is afraid of going past the university bubble, I rarely trekked far from school. One day, my friend with a car showed me the beauty that is Lotus. Now I take the effort to make trips there by bus or car because it's worth it. The selection is the most expansive: sure there are other Asian specialty stores, but none as big as Lotus. It's really hard to find Vietnamese cooking ingredients in Pittsburgh, but Lotus has most of it.   The pricing is pretty legit. For example, let's say I wanted to just get some noodles for some pho (Vietnamese beef noodle soup. If you don't know what it is, Yelp the closest pho restaurant and get a bowl, now). Giant Eagle would sell it for 3-4 bucks. Lotus sells it for $1.50 for about the same amount. And if you wanted rice? Seriously... you can get as much rice as you want.   Then I walked to the fruit isle, I saw rambutan, lychee, dragonfruit, etc. etc. etc. etc. AHH! It's like home! Time to make some \"che\" (Vietnamese dessert). Also, if you are feeling adventurous, they sell durian sometimes too.  Of course, the prices will never compare to my hometown. But I figure that a $500 plane flight is not very cost-effective."}
{"text":"Put some time into learning how to shop this store and you will be greatly rewarded.  Excellent values all over the place, and things you can't find anywhere else.  I especially like the produce department.    Lotus is one of only 4 stores I always have to shop when I visit the strip."}
{"text":"My go to place for Asian product needs.  Not to mention the fact that their produce is among the freshest in The Strip!  Lotus is one of my regular shopping haunts.  I would be lost without them!!!"}
{"text":"I found decent prices here and I did feel a little out of my element I couldn't understand the names on their packaging. I bought some bamboo spoons for 35 cents each. I love wooden spoons for my tea."}
{"text":"Mean cashier, dirty environment, no knowledge of Pittsburgh schools when u try to use student card for discount , they ask u lots of questions because they have no idea of the schools in Pittsburgh and don't believe you . don't shop here"}
{"text":"It's taken me a long time to finally go into Lotus to see what I could find, and I've found my other go to Asian market, along with Many More! I'm usually shopping for Korean basics, and  while I know there are Korean markets in Pittsburgh, a lot of times, I'm closer to the downtown area than Squirrel Hill for (Young's).  Lotus is well stocked with the names and ingredients that are familiar to me, and so I am planning on doing more of my Asian shopping trips downtown. My first trip to Lotus, and I picked up just the basics to get started. Lots of fresh produce, and a great freezer selection of dumplings, fish cakes, and other ingredients I never found strange growing up, like tripe, pigs feet, ears, dried anchovies, and squid. Definitely happy, and planning on eating really well for a while.  Not as cramped as other Asian stores, nicely lit, and perhaps organized a little nicer than some stores too. Your true exotic store complete with Durian, and duck balut, EEK!"}
{"text":"Lots of options, good prices. Occasionally have picked up spoiled products, and it's very tight and crowded during the weekends."}
{"text":"Why would you go to an Asian supermarket and then complain that the food packaging is \"in Asian writing\", or that the people working there couldn't understand what you were asking for? That is insane.  Lotus is always the first stop I make on my weekend grocery runs. If you know what you're looking for, but not quite sure where it is on the shelf, it is usually pretty easy to find it. The store is pretty organized and the layout smooth, even though it might not seem it.  As a frequent shopper here, my biggest complaint is the random people that stand in the middle of an aisle or blocking a food selection, surfing the web on their phone, trying to figure out what that one new ingredient that they saw on the Food Network is called. It's an extremely busy place, so it's a good idea to keep the pace moving and not hold anybody up.  The staff is usually as friendly as I think they need to be. I'm always greeted with a \"hi\" and a \"thank you\" as I walk out the door. As I mentioned, it's a very busy place, so you need to prepare yourself for that. It's usually better to have some cash on hand for a quick check out, and it usually ends up being a lot cheaper than you expect.  There is a large variety of items here and prices are very reasonable. They have a great selection of cooking oils and sauces (soy, sesame, fish, etc) in many different sizes (including gallon sizes). Also, they carry brands from most of the East/Southeast Asian countries, so if you're picky about the brand you use, there are many choices.  They carry most of the usual stuff you would expect to find in an Asian market, including various types of noodles, tea, snacks, biscuits, and kitchen gear (chopsticks, bowls/plates, woks, etc).  If you're looking for produce, Lotus is one of the better stores to buy from. You can usually find pretty fresh vegetables at a very cheap price. Bok choy, cabbage, leeks, onions, garlic, okra, beans, bean sprout, young coconuts, eggplant, yuca... basically everything you would expect. As many people mentioned, they also have fresh tofu at a very low price. This goes so fast, they are constantly rotating the trays to keep it in stock.  What else, what else... fresh fish, squid, shrimp, seaweed. Quail eggs, balut, chicken eggs. Instant noodles, pancit, soup bowls. Various canned soda, jelly, and coffee drinks. Frozen wontons, wrappers, etc.  So, in my opinion, this is one of the best Asian markets in the Strip District. Large variety, fully stocked, cheap prices, good quality. That's all it takes."}
{"text":"I strongly not recommend this store at all for their rudeness. The middle aged woman and the other man seem like manager are extremely mean without any manner. I recommend other Asian markets."}
{"text":"I made my first trip to Lotus Food this weekend to pick up ingredients for an Asian-style salad, which I posted about on my blog (www.cookingthestrip.com). I was very impressed with the variety of Asian spices and sauces. They also carry a great selection of fresh specialty Asian produce and herbs, most of which I have not seen anywhere else, especially your typical grocery store. I was also excited to see that they are open until 6pm on weeknights, which is later than all other Strip District specialty shops - I'll definitely be making more trips there in the future!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. There's literally thousands of jars, cans and packages of all sorts of things from Asia. I don't know what most of it is, but I'm sure if I did...I'd create an Asian masterpiece on my kitchen.  I managed to score cans of bamboo shoots and straw mushrooms and a bottle of sesame oil for about half what it would have cost at Giant Eagle. My real find was the fresh chow mein noodles for $.95! Much more healthy for my 2 year old than ramen and she thinks they're the same thing. Plus they cook in 20 seconds.  There's just tons and tons of cool looking stuff here. There's also a bunch of atypical produce, fresh tofu...some meat. Lots of cool frozen meats, a whole aisle of rice and noodles...I just wish I knew what all of it was."}
{"text":"The food you need to be careful, because sometimes they are expired. Price is just acceptable. Maybe due to it is famous and popular, people who work there are not very friendly. Also, parking is a big problem."}
{"text":"I guess there's not really much option for Asian grocery in Pittsburgh, so it's a good thing they're not taking advantage of their kind-of monopoly? Conveniently located in a place to park and shop at various places in the strip, though traffic can get horrible on Saturdays.   It gets awfully crowded because this is really the only place for Asian grocery shopping in the area. They definitely have everything we've needed for a reasonable price, though my mom hoards dried goods and the like when we drive out of town  to other cities with bigger Asian communities because they're maybe twice as expensive sometimes here. But fresh tofu  made in house! I have never seen that anywhere else, definitely not at big chain Asian groceries.  Tip: I remember seeing a long, long time ago that they restock twice a week, and it used to be posted on their door (maybe?) or we asked, but it's pretty easy to find out when the produce will be freshest."}
{"text":"Five stars for the diversity/authenticity/price of products.  This grocery store has a huge collection of items - including various sauces, fresh vegetables/meats/seafood, tofu, frozen items, kitchen utensils, noodles/rice, snacks, and much more.   I am very fond of their freezer section. There is variety of dim sum items that you can steam, assorted buns/pancakes, meats, noodles, etc etc. They also have some other asian things like miso paste, kimchi, naan, etc.   The fresh fruit/vegetables section is not the best though, they don't have a huge quantity/variety, likely because there is a cheap grocery store right across the street. But they do carry all the unique chinese vegetables and bok choy, chinese cabbage, etc. They also have seaweed knots, pigs blood, and fresh tofu laid out. Everything is relatively inexpensive.   There is a hot food/bakery section that serves tea eggs, barbecued meat over rice, bubble tea, and steamed buns. They also have a small cooler with some packaged chinese pastries. However, none of the hot foods/baked goods seemed very fresh and was a bit pricey. Would not recommend this area of the store."}
{"text":"I was told that Lotus Food Co. was the best Asian market in the Strip District. While the selection seems to be diverse enough for the needs of a home chef looking to spice up their repertoire with some Asian-inspired dishes, coming from California, I felt like this market lacked some Asian essentials that are more readily available at markets located in larger cities or areas where there are higher concentrations of Asians. If you're in this area however, Lotus is worth a try-- they've got all the bottles sauces, Asian veggies, and dry noodles that you'll need. But if you're looking for multiple brands of specific products, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"The best place in the strip to get asian ingredients.  I love running in there to pick up some young jack fruit in a can.  They have awesome products and honestly, the clerks were happy to explain what certain things were to me.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"What sets Lotus apart from the other Asian grocery stores in the Strip is that it also serves some prepared foods (which I've been dying to try and have yet to). This place gets great business on the weekends which leaves you weaving in and out of customers at any point on Saturdays or Sundays. Despite this, you can still easily get in and out of here because they're usually stocked with all that you need and the cashiers are speedy. The selection is nice and the produce is usually fresh.   I don't have anything to complain about with this store aside from the fact that I wish it had longer hours, particularly the weekdays (they're open until 7). I'd like the option of going on a weekday after work to avoid the weekend crowd.  Overall, this place is a one-stop shop for your Asian groceries. Prices are reasonable and selection is varied."}
{"text":"YAY for a Chinese Supermarket in Pittsburgh!! It's on the Strip.  I've rarely seen any Chinese people around Pittsburgh.. but walking into this store I found them all haha.  Think of your typical Ranch 99 market. That's what it is basically.  You'll find your asian snacks like Pocky, essentials like rice and egg noodles, vegetables, fish, and so forth.  Picked up: red beans, chinese rock brown sugar, evaporated milk, curry mix, grass jelly drink.  All for less than $11.  Angela C. is right on the spot."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for fresh herbs.  .59 cents for a large bundle of cilantro or Italian parsley.  $1.19 for fresh basil.  You can't beat those prices!  I have paid a lot more at Giant Eagle...and for a smaller amount."}
{"text":"I love their hot bunss!!!  Squeeze em' like charmin.  Heh, heh, Lotus is a go to for me when I am in the strip which is very regularly.  I am such a big fan of Asian food and absolutely love to cook it, so their is no way I can not go without Lotus.  The selection just dwarfs the others in the Strip District by comparison.  The prices are super cheap, but the quality of the items are very good.  The produce like daikon, bok choy, Chinese cabbage, mushrooms, bean sprouts, spinach is very crisp.  I tend to keep an eye out when going through some produce there.  Some of it tends to look a bit over ripe, i.e. some of the peppers, the Chinese eggplant(looked a bit wrinkly).     The buns I was talking about at the beggining of this reveiw are the various breads and desserts that they keep over to the far right of the store.  I just bought the sesame balls with red bean paste in the middle.  You just heat them up at bit and they taste like they are from a Chinese restaraunt, yummmmm.  O.k., so some of the workers there that do not speak English very well and may give you a funny look, but it adds to the authenticity for me.  Ask the shorter, older lady(don't know any names), or the skinny, older gentlemen and they always help you with anything.  Get some bulk essentials there like rice, noodles, cooking oils and spices.  The tea is cheap and they even have woks, tea pots and little saki serving bottles."}
{"text":"This grocery store is perfect for hard to find Asian ingredients and foods. They are just like every other market with dry goods, produce and a freezer section. They have many varieties of canned goods, snacks, candy, herbs and spices, and dumplings.   We really enjoy all the steamed buns, dumplings and breads. Haven't had anything we dislike yet.  Only thing I am wary about is the produce. A lot of it seems to come from overseas so it is very ripe or almost rotten. Don't get me wrong, some things aren't at that point yet but I'm still cautious.   Staff are very friendly and willing to help, which I always need when I'm looking for key, unique ingredients or recipes."}
{"text":"While I buy most of my essential produce and groceries across the street from Market Outlet, Lotus is THE place to go for specialty Asian groceries, including noodles, snacks, veggies, cooking sauces and oils, and tofu.   And not just packaged fridge/shelf tofu, which is still cheaper here than anywhere else.   I'm talking FRESH TOFU made on Saturdays and Sundays only. At 60 cents per block, it so insanely blows any other tofu provider in Pittsburgh out of the water. I usually bring a tupperware container and fill it up with six or seven blocks at a time. Then I keep one or two fresh in my fridge as a soft tofu option, and freeze the rest (ever frozen tofu? I highly recommend trying it, it creates a fantastic texture once cooked).  If you're planning a night of making homemade sushi, dumplings, spring rolls, or stir fry, or any other delicious Asian cuisine, go here for the best, cheapest supplies!  They have all your crazy Asian processed foods too, like snacks and candies and pre-packaged noodle soups, but those ain't my cup of tea. Oh, which they also have. A LOT of.  One last note: $5 minimum on the card, but if you show a student ID, you get a small discount!"}
{"text":"This is hands-down the best Asian grocery I have visited in Pittsburgh. It is a huge store and is really well-organized so you can find what you are looking for pretty quickly. The absolute best thing about this place is the fresh tofu. Besides tasting better than the stuff from the regular store, it is outrageously cheap--$1 for 3 pieces (3 pieces = about 1 & 1/2 blocks of packaged tofu) They have a great section of Asian-style noodles, snacks, and sauces, with the brand variety you will never get at a typical grocery store. They also have a really good selection of fresh produce that is hard to find in other stores.  Be warned, the products do not always have English translations. This doesn't mean newbies aren't welcome, it just means you might make a few mistakes on the way. The store clerks are usually not very helpful because 1) this place runs on a very small staff and everyone is always busy, and 2) many of the employees don't speak English very well. The small staff is part of the reason this place is so cheap, so cut them a break. As for the language barrier--it's a traditional Asian grocery store, so yes, English is not their first language; don't be surprised. I don't consider these detriments because this store perfectly suits my needs. It is definitely not an introductory course in Asian cuisine, so don't expect anyone to hold your hand. But if you know what you are looking for, or if you are just feeling adventurous and willing to make a few mistakes, this place is worth a look."}
{"text":"overall best quality Asian grocer in the strip district, imo . freshest produce, best selection of niche food products and oddities (to the avg. american , anyway.) cute check out girls ."}
{"text":"I love this place! You walk in and it feels like any asian grocery store in NYC. I don't do my primary grocery shopping here, but I really like their soy sauce selection. Also, the frozen spring rolls and dumplings are really good.   They also have fresh ramen which is awesome.   The big thing for me is the packaged ramen selection near the check out counters at the end of the produce. They have so many different types of authentic ramen and it's so much better than what we get at western grocery stores. There's on kind that is pork and the noodles are so good."}
{"text":"This is a great Asian food store and they have a lot of fresh vegatables."}
{"text":"Fresh tofu towards the back is a must if you see them! Good selection of veggies and snacks. The workers could be more friendly and the environment could improve but this is the best place for Asian goods if you live in Pittsburgh. Come during the weekday or later in the day during weekends otherwise parking is almost impossible."}
{"text":"I stopped in only because I saw the sign for Boba Tea outside and I was having a bit of a craving.  The store seemed very authentic and extensive! I went right to the deli-type counter and was served almost immediately.  I had the mango green tea with tapioca and it was DELICIOUS and very inexpensive!  I highly recommend a quick stop to see what's in store and grab a Boba while you're at it!"}
{"text":"I needed to update my review, after coming to Lotus 4+ times in the past month. I am now officially OBSESSED with this place.   Yes, Lotus is great for specific and hard to find Asian food items like dark soy sauce, sesame oil, chili paste and dumpling wrappers- but they are also great for other things as well.  Produce- Lotus has some of the freshest and cheapest produce around. You can't beat their prices on bok choy, and they have about 4-5 different types to choose from! Their scallions, peppers, eggplant and chives are also VERY affordable. I also love their selection of mushrooms- from shiitake to oyster to enoki mushrooms- they have it all. Their Japanese yams are WAY cheaper here than at Whole foods. They sell onions and lemons and limes individually, and they have thai basil which you can't find any where else! Chinese broccoli, snap/snow peas.. the list goes on and on and they are ALL affordable. They don't have a huge organic selection, but they do have some organic mushrooms.   Spices- Lotus has AMAZING prices on spices. From whole fennel seeds to bay leaves to sesame seeds to whole cinnamon sticks- they have a pretty large selection throughout the entire store. Their cinnamon sticks are the cheapest I have ever seen- 5 of them for under $1.00. They sell fresh tumeric and fresh ginger here- again, wayyy cheaper than Whole Foods or Giant Eagle. They have fresh cilantro and again- their chives are VERY cheap and you get a TON of them in a package.  Even if you don't live Asian food, I would recommend coming here for the spices alone. You will be surprised.   Kitchen supplies- Chopsticks, bamboo sticks, cheesecloth, wooden spatulas, strainers, bowls... they have SUCH an amazing selection of cheap but good quality kitchen supplies. I was looking for thick bamboo sticks for an appetizer I was making for Christmas and went on Amazon first to look. I found a pack of 100 for about $7. I thought that wasn't a bad price. I didn't purchase them, since I figured I would just check around at Lotus first and I found a pack of 100 for $.50.... 50 CENTS! Are you kidding? I couldn't believe it. I bought a little skimmer for taking fried foods out of hot oil- under $3 for a good sized one. I then went a block or two down to the kitchen store in the strip and saw the same size skimmer for over $20... insanity.   Fun snacks- macadamia nut cookies- $2.50, little cookies that look like burgers and are insanely delicious and fun to eat- $2.00, pocky, gummy candy.. they have a great selection of unique and fun snacks. They are all VERY affordable too.  Other amazing items to try when you visit- the dark soy sauce is life changing. It's sweeter and more thicker than traditional soy sauce and is a real treat. They make their own tofu- it's the freshest around and is only 35 CENTS A BLOCK. It's unbelievably good, too. Their dumpling wrappers are in the freezer section and are under $2 for over 60 wrappers- SO cheap and SO easy to make delicious and fun food with them. They are a steal. You can't beat their prices for sushi rice ($2 for 1 lb.), sushi nori (about $2) and the mat to make the sushi with was under $2 as well. They have a great tea selection and if you are into seafood, they have a HUGE seafood selection. They have a great noodle selection and their ramen noodles are delicious. The one thing I was a little disappointed in is there selection of kimchi- they only had 1 kind to choose from the last couple of times that I visited.  This place is AMAZING and I highly suggest that you think about it not only when you are buying your specific Asian food items, but for your casual grocery shopping as well. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Looks like interesting selections... but I was sccolded by the staff for taking photos of the stock! Staff member said that the owner banned photos in his store. Told her it was for Yelp. Didn't matter. WTF? Owner is against free advertising, apparently. An anti-business business. Crazy stuff."}
{"text":"The 50s old man (probably the owner) is very very rude! I went there purchasing some foods for a friends' gathering as well as my own stuffs. It is fairly reasonable for me to pay respectively right? But this old man kept complaining that I shouldnt do that becauae he would have to swipe my card twice and cost him extra transction fees. How ridiculous it was! I could let one of my friends to check and the second-swipe of the credit card is inevitable! Even worse, there will make some expired food on discount. Luckily we found these awful expired foods twice, and they were reluctant to make exchange with NO apologies!!!  I have to say it is definitely not a good place for Chinese, Asians, or ANYBODY! If you wanna get some HEALTHY Asian foods, please go to somewhere else!"}
{"text":"What irks me about this place is the rudeness.  I know this place is located in the Strip and it's suppose to be fast paced and all, but be polite to me if you intend for me to return.  I will admit I did find some decent buys for the items I needed while in here, but had no idea where to find anything.  I roamed the aisles until I stumbled upon what I needed.  However, when I did find exactly what I needed, I had to wait for a congregation of people having their Sunday chat on a Thursday to move.  When I am in this type of situation I become very irritated very easily.  Also be sure to spend at least $5 or else be prepared to be told off at checkout.  That's the cherry on top of the rudeness cake.  Not quite sure the reasoning behind this action.  You're getting my money either way."}
{"text":"Used to be here a lot. Not anymore though. Not because of the food but the attitude of those cashiers. Every time I check out, they just freely throw my foods which I took time to pick carefully. One time a box of sponge cakes came open, as checking me out, the cashier touched the cake inside then put it in my checkout bag. So Gross! Staff definitely are really rude. Try not to come here unless it's for emergency."}
{"text":"I come here almost every weekend to get fresh tofu, herbs and/or vegetables. 4 blocks of tofu for $.40 each - yeah I'm taking that over the over-priced 'ethnic' offerings at Giant Eagle any day.  There's a big variety of noodles and frozen dumplings offerings and all manner of products that confuse the hillel out of me since I'm not East Asian. But hey, sometimes it's just fun to look as well."}
{"text":"Wanting hella Asian snacks around the night!   located near my hotel!  This place is A ok... has all the basic Asian needs when it comes to a supermarket...too bad there's a lot of Rude ass employees working there which gets on my dame nerves!  this place has become a very popular Asian Supermarket since they are located on the strip.... I'd say it's bigger and cleaner looking compared to the other Asian stores around Pittsburgh...  While you're there...check their produce out...fresh but overpriced!"}
{"text":"Lotus Food, If I could shop there every day I would. I always shop when I am in the strip district for the afternoon, mostly on the weekends.  I have always had a pleasant shopping afternoon. I have found everything I needed or found interesting to try.    The store has great inexpensive produce, I have never left the store without purchasing fresh produce that is stocked on the weekends. I love their kitchen supply section. I have purchased my oriental dish set there and continue to add to it each shopping trip.  I also shop for  fusion oolong tea, that I cannot find anywhere else. They have an excellent dry and frozen section as well.  Others have stated, that it is too cramped on the weekends, I have not found this to be true. I haven't found  it to be cramped, Its very comfortable to move around the store, even with cart or basket. I must have found the right time of day on my weekend shopping trip. I usually make this my last stop for the day.  Parking outside of the store on Penn Avenue can be a pain, but there is plenty of parking behind the building on Smallman and in several parking lots down the street, if your able to walk. On a nice day it's great to just stroll along the shopping district.  I do recommend bringing your own bag, for those that are recycling friendly. As for the friendliness and service, I cannot complain or comment. The owners do speck a little English. I avoid them as they avoid me. I have never had any reason to interact with them, other than check out. I have not asked questions, because I have found the store to be well stocked, and everything I need easy to locate."}
{"text":"Owner is very rude. A 50-60years old man did the check out. He blamed/accused us, out of no where, for showing him our ids during the process but not at the beginning of the check out. This literally makes no difference at all for him, or us. For example, when to scan your giant eagle membership during the check out at giant eagle literally makes no difference.  He blamed us as if that caused him so much trouble and costed so much money for him. My hubby, who did not want to cause any trouble, had to apologize. This was an very unpleasant shopping experience, and it was not the first time they are so rude to us. If you don't want to be treated like a piece of $***, don't  come and shop here. I will never return."}
{"text":"This is our stop right after Stan's Market for all the other \"uncommon\" fresh produce. They offer a wide variety of fresh produce including some that are unfamiliar to most Pittsburghers. Besides produce,  they sell all sorts of asian packaged foods and goods.  Our bi-monthly visit here is mostly for the super cheap fresh produce and tofu. Our list of Vegetables usually include the Mustard Green, few different types of bok-choy and spinach along with some herbs like cilantro, mint , basil etc. Like Stan's the vegetables here are super cheap and fresh but unlike Stan's you don't really need to double check them :) since they're usually very fresh and of good quality.  If you're not an avid cook - you might want to try some of the wide varieties of Ramen and packaged food this place has to offer."}
{"text":"If I can give haft a star I would. Never shop at this Asian grocery since Many more open. Owner and employee alike no manners and nasty. Sorry guys it's the truth."}
{"text":"This place is cheap, usually has a good selection (minus my most recent visit where Thai basil was nowhere to be found), and if you go at the right time, can be easier to navigate.  I will say though that when I asked where the thai basil may be, I was looked at like I was born on Jupiter.  I wish they had some people there who could assist with those people who do not speak their language as the barrier seems to be a problem whenever I have asked for assistance.  Usually, I can fare fine enough on my own though, thank God!"}
{"text":"Of the top 3 (IMHO) Asian groceries in the Strip District (Wing Fat Hong, Lotus Foods, and Many More Asian Market), this place seems to get the most cred.  I'm guessing this is partially due to its prime Wholey's-adjacent location in the strip and partially because, for a typical Asian market, it's remarkably clean and organized.  That makes it a pleasure to do my shopping here, although the selection is much smaller than that of the other stores in almost every respect.  The exception is the fresh fish corner, which is my go-to for buying fresh whole fish in Pittsburgh when I'm feeling up to the task of cleaning it myself.  The seafood selection is variable, but there are typically around 10-12 different varieties of fish, squid, and shellfish.  And everything is clearly marked, which is very much appreciated.  The produce selection changes up too, but vegetables are always fresh and cheap.  I always get my fresh herbs here, aka I rely on their constant supply of beautiful Thai basil when my own plants call it quits for the winter.  TL;DR--a comfortable, if limited, Asian grocery store experience.  No reason not to stop by if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I LOVED going to this supermarket. I went to college in Pittsburgh over a decade ago now and would frequently crave Chinese groceries. There were no Chinese bakery that I know of but this grocery story would import Chinese baked goods from New York City and I would buy as much as I could fit in my bag and bring them back to my dorm room. A small grocery store but for any one wanting Chinese groceries and snacks, this place IS IT!  To the reviewer who said never seeing Chinese people in Pittsburgh: there are actually a lot of \"native\" Chinese Pittsburgh folks. There is even the Pittsburgh Chinese Church in the North Side. There used to be a Chinatown in Pittsburgh many decades ago but that got torn down when the freeway was built."}

{"text":"The old man cashier is really AGGRESSIVE and HUMILIATING!  1. He asked me what kinds of card I was going to use. I said \"Discover\". He used his EYE WHITE to look at me and said \"I didn't hear.\" I said \"Discover card\". Then he said \"Oh, credit.\" 2. At the same time I presented my Discover card, I presented my student card to get 5% off. He used his EYE WHITE to look at me again. Then he said, \"Remember. You should present your student card before I take your order.\" His tone was like a teacher teaching a student. But I am mature enough; plus, I did nothing wrong. The computer is totally fine if I present the student card after the cashier takes my order as long as I have not swiped my card. (I did this several times.)  In summary, - He used his EYE WHITE to look at me twice. This was HUMILIATION! - He used a teacher's tone to \"teach\" me. This was doubling the HUMILIATION! - I have to say the cashiers in this store are generally not nice."}
{"text":"This update is long overdue, since I've wanted to mention the hot street food takeout and it's been available for a while. They have both savory and sweet, as well as bubble tea drinks, so you could conceivably fill yourself up here (although what I normally like to do is to get a little bit of everything from all around the Strip). The braised pork over rice and (more recently) steamed pork buns are very tasty and fresh, with the latter good for sharing. They also have the \"open-faced\" steamed buns (??) filled with pork belly and pickled vegetables. All three are good options and quite authentic.  On the sweet side, some options are the usual bubble teas, along with non milk-teas, as well as mini cakes with filling like red bean or custard. The latter are closer to the Japanese-style desserts, also a popular street food. They are also made fresh, with the batter being topped with the filling and then grilled in the iron onsite. Overall, any of these are great to try, and there's a small counter area for eating in as well."}
{"text":"This place is pretty excellent.    Having spent some time in China (and heading to do so again soon, here,) I got a taste for some things that are pretty tough to get in your regular old grocery store.  Adding Lao gan ma or Xiao yu you to most anything that can take it, for example, has become a habit of mine.  Hotpot seasoning is important, too, as is real Fang bian mian and Wang lao ji.  (Note: Yelp didn't post the Chinese characters I wrote in my initial review... Weird.)  But it doesn't stop at the Chinese stuff, either.  I've been able to find Thai tea here, and black rice for making black rice pudding!   The other thing that's super-groovy about this place is that you'll never feel like you spent too much on your groceries.  Everything is so cheap!  And they take cards, which makes them heroes in a place like the Strip."}
{"text":"Still an awesome place. I'm still not sure why some reviewers call this place smelly and call its service bad. Have they been to any other Asian markets?   To everyone blocking the aisles: KEEP IT MOVING.   They have mantous. Plain or with chives."}
{"text":"I am so glad that there are a few Asian markets around here like Lotus. I lived in Ottawa, Ontario for two years and they have a chain called T&T, which is an Asian superstore, as big as any super walmart you'll find here. These Asian markets are so incredibly cheap compared to most \"normal\" grocery stores. My boyfriend and I do all the shopping that we can at Lotus, and then fill in the gaps at Market District and it saves us so much money! Especially when it comes to herbs. We love to cook a variety of Asian cuisines, and buying things like cilantro, mint, and thai basil elsewhere can be very costly. And don't even get me started on rice. We buy the big 10 lb. bulk bags of Jasmine for not much more than a small bag would cost you elsewhere. I'm so glad that Pittsburgh has the diversity we crave!"}
{"text":"The spruced man that stands by the main register is not well mannered. I was answered about a product I was looking for with a \"AH? I DON'T KNOW! MAYBE THERE!\" brushed me off and pointed to the isle the product I wanted was at. Don't worry, I found it after looking for it for 10 minutes.  Aside from this impertinent man, the store seems to have a variety of products. They're always busy and their shelfs are stocked frequently.   I was also told their tofu is fresh, so much so that a coworker of mine eats it raw.   Unfortunately it's hard to find some products. Most packaging are in Asian writing and I don't understand it."}
{"text":"Place to go to get Asian groceries in Pittsburgh. They are surprisingly well stocked and have mostly everything you would need. I think I only ran into the problem once where they didn't sell something I needed.  They have a great fresh vegetable section, restocked every weekend, with most if not all the common Asian vegetables and even uncommon ones which I thought I would never find in Pittsburgh including tung ho, suan miao, loofah, etc.  They have a decent freezer section which includes some frozen meats. They even sell some prepared foods like zongzi, stewed bamboo, and other meats.  Their bakery section is very small and I think they ship their breads from Chinatown in NYC, but there's almost no place else you can get Asian breads besides Sumi's bakery and Bubble Pi in Squirrel Hill.  On weekends, they sell fresh tofu which they make in house. Relatively speaking, Lotus is very small compared to an Asian food market not in Pittsburgh, but being that Pittsburgh lacks a lot of good Asian restaurants and groceries in general, this place is great."}
{"text":"Coming from Boston and shopped at many different Asian grocery stores, am impressed with selection and prices here. They sell the big brands of tofu and seem to make their own tofu as well. They have Japanese soba and ramen as well as Chinese noodles, fresh and dried.   Fresh produce wise, their scallions are healthy and big and well priced. Cabbage, small cabbage, and even Chinese cucumber. Chinese eggplant, and white radish as well.  Their frozen section has all the sweet desserts and savory items you could possibly want.  But I agree with the other reviewers on google that the owners/family have a serious customer service attitude problem.   They scowl at you if you ask them something or if you merely glanced their way or even smiled at them. They bag your items by throwing them in the bag. They simply don't look you in the eye.  If you can get over interacting with them, this is a small store with a huge selection of Chinese, Japanese, a little Korean, and Thai/Indonesian stuff."}
{"text":"Probably the best, most thorough Chinese supermarket you'll find in Pittsburgh. They have most of your Chinese grocery needs at pretty decent prices. They even have the staple unfriendly cashiers. Some, not all; just enough to fill the expectation. If you're an Asian American transplant from a bigger city, you'll appreciate having Lotus Foods in da Burgh."}
{"text":"I'm hoping you at least glance at this review instead of just seeing the rating. I'm a weird sort of customer... I'm black but lightskin, with long locs; so I'm noticeable. Also, I've survived on a specific-ish southeast asian diet for years now. I laughed as I read all the reviews because they were correct about the store owners bad attitude.  BUT the stores selection and prices are awesome! So my advice is \"get in, get out\", pay in cash (it's easier), and don't ask questions.  If ANYBODY knows of one of the other Asian supermarkets in the Strip that have a better southeast asian food selection, OR better prices, OR employees with a much better attitude (towards blacks).... PLEASE let me know."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Chinese supermarket I have found in Pittsburgh so far. They have a good supply of Asian produce, packaged food, snacks, candy, sauces, teas, etc. The prices here are a bit high, but it is well-stocked and usually is the only place that has what I am looking/ craving for. There is another Chinese store, a small Korean market, and a just as small Vietnamese store a couple blocks away, but all of them are not as stocked, big, or as good as Lotus Food Co (in my opinion).   There is also an in-store sushi bar, with either bento boxes or made to order sushi depending on when you visit the store. I am unsure of the hours the bar is open. I also like how Lotus Food Co orders some Chinese pastries from Chinese bakeries in New York and other places. I bought a box of chiffon sponge cake and ate one everyday for breakfast for like a week or so. The also have other things like cookies and Chinese swiss rolls. During New Year, they had little red envelopes and other things like New Year candy in stock."}
{"text":"If you are looking for ingredients for asian cooking I definitely recommend taking a trip to lotus! They have a wide selection of items and even if your giant eagle (or whatever store) has the items too, the prices at lotus are probably better. Of course that depends, but for me here is an example:  Identical can of lychees   Giant eagle: ~$4.45 Lotus:~$2.20  Crazy!  It's also fun to browse and just try something new.   If you need curries, tapioca pearls, tofu, durian, galanga, dried mushrooms... you'll find it all here.  Just a couple random examples.   They have sweets and they have housewares like certain cups and dishes, chop sticks, etc."}
{"text":"Good store - Rude Owners and Employees.  There is an old saying in the food industry.....food brings you in and the service brings you back.  I don't care how well stocked a store is, if I am treated like crap....then no thank you.  Get some manners  Lotus!"}
{"text":"I come here because they offer the best deal on the following items: Sambal Oelek fresh ground chili paste, eel sauce, low sodium worchestershire, and thai chilis. They also carry this fruit pudding/custard type stuff that is very delicious right by the register. Worth the trip to get what you need to make Thai, Asain or chinese food right at home!"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh is unusually lacking any good Asian grocers. This was the closest I could find and compared to the ones in Philadelphia this can't even compete. However, considering that it's Pittsburgh, this is probably the best Asian store around.  While the location is a little far I am willing to trek all the way to Lotus for a few ingredients that only they have in stock! It holds all sorts of miscellaneous food stuffs that I am always dying to try.   The prices are pretty good and I always leave spending 10 dollars less than I thought I'd spend.   They have tofu there that is really really cheap! It is also a little questionable how they serve it but, I've never denied myself some discount tofu.   While the baked goods there temptingly cheap - they are not fresh so I'd stay away from those.   Overall I'd say that I need to go for another lotus run"}
{"text":"SETTING Standard Asian grocery store vibe. White tiles, fluorescent lights, the smells, lots of people speaking Mandarin Chinese. On the intercom, they played Chinese pop/R&B music that got me reminiscing about my Jay Chou phase back in the day. Plenty of people shop here for their asian goods, which makes things a bit crowded and busy here.   FOOD Leans toward Chinese groceries/goods with their selection of frozen foods (dumplings, scallion pancakes, etc) and snacks, but it also caters to most asian cultural foods with common vegetables (bok choy, napa cabbage, etc). Lots of Chinese-speaking workers and customers who seem knowledgeable about where things are placed if you need to find them. Oh, and fresh and inexpensive tofu on a cart!!! YES!  Not many fresh seafood offerings, probably better to walk a few minutes over to Wholey's.   IMPRESSIONS Small to Medium sized grocery store, but probably the most comprehensive in terms asian food offerings in Pittsburgh. Has most things you need, except for tissues if you're Asian-American/Asian like me and get a little bit homesick every time you step foot in Lotus. Somebody give me a hug!"}
{"text":"PROS: nice variety including freshly made tofu, good amount of side street parking nearby (as long as you don't go on a weekend), baked goods (haven't tried any yet), on the strip so you can do some additional shopping if needed  CONS: bit pricey, person working there wasn't that helpful or friendly"}
{"text":"Lotus foods is a complete Asian Grocery stocking everything from fresh produce and tofu running the gamut from soup to soy nuts.  Super affordable, and if you are looking to add some Asian Flare to your cooking, well..... you will find it here, OH and if you can not find it here, you will not find it in the United States.  Even if you have no interest in cooking Asian, browse this grocery, I bet you will buy something.  They have really cool chopsticks and amazing Kimchi (who doesn't like Kimchi ??)  The only problem you will find, is that you will not be able to communicate with the staff very well, so spare yourself asking any questions.  I am pretty sure that they understand English (I mean really ???  How long has this store been in the Strip ??) however; they kind of choose not to communicate with patrons.  That aside, Lotus will expand your culinary ventures.  Give it a try, even if you just pick up a bottle of their soda/pop which has directions on how to open it.   It's by the registers, you will be fully amused."}
{"text":"Best Asian grocery in Pittsburgh. Went shopping for ingredients for a Korean dish I was making and they had everything. Food is fresh also!"}
{"text":"Yesterday, I left my groceries at the store and they told me to come back some other time or have a credit for the items! So touching!!!"}
{"text":"A good store to pick up your East Asian cooking ingredients. There is a large selection of sauces, oils, and noodles. They also carry rice which you can buy in bulk. The freezer section is quite large, but I'm not too sure about what sort of freezer goods they sell. They also have produce which is on par with the other vendors in the strip. Lastly, there is a small fresh fish section in the back."}
{"text":"Where I do most of my shopping. Pretty basic. Missing some Japanese groceries I would like to find but otherwise, expansive and reasonably priced, I was totally surprised to find this sort of place, having looked for something like the past four years in cleveland, to no avail."}
{"text":"I come here to get organic short grain brown rice, nori paper, fermented condiments, daikon radishes, kabocha squashes, and beech mushrooms.  Their produce is hit or miss. Sometimes it's great unique stuff at a good price. Other times it's started to rot by the time you get home.  The store itself is dingy and depressing in decor and cleanliness. The staff and owners are nice enough and will help you find things if you ask, but they look absolutely miserable."}
{"text":"After an unpleasant experience at Lotus Grocery on 17 February 2014, I want to caution customers to be careful when paying with cash at the store.    My order was $3.08.  I gave the glum and cold middle aged female cashier $10.10.  She put the $10 bill in the till and gave me $2.02 change, which would have been correct had I given her a $5 bill.  I told her that I gave her a ten dollar bill, and she repeatedly insisted that I did not.  I went to the mean middle aged man who appears to be manager or owner and told him of the problem.  He was not interested in hearing it and it eventually fell into the lap of a short, middle aged woman who also appears to be manager, and is one of the nicer people on the staff.  I got nowhere until I asked that a count of the register receipts.  The woman who  appears to be in management suggested that I leave my phone number and that I would be called after the store closes and a count is completed. That was not acceptable to me. I asked that a count be conducted while I waited and she agreed.  As she counted and recounted, I waited patiently.  She ultimately concluded that I was right and gave me my $5.00.  She apologized multiple times; the clerk who would have cheated me out of $5 did not.  I will be careful when shopping at this store.  I will try to pay with one dollar bills in the future and will announce how much money I am handing to the cashier. There is a bitter taste in my mouth about Lotus Grocery.  Of all places for this to happen, it would have to be one where there is a language barrier and where most of the employees are dismissive of the customer.  This is not Giant Eagle!"}
{"text":"I was highly impressed with their prices and selection. To anyone traveling near there its a must stop...."}
{"text":"Lotus has a great selection of Asian foods (most of which I have no idea what to do with).  They have absurdly cheap and very tasty fresh tofu that comes cut in bricks and is self-serve.  They also have a wide variety of instant noodles, soup bases and stir-fry sauces, and fresh produce.  I tried a pre-made Ma Po Tofu mix the other day that was great.  Be warned, the store smells disgusting, like a mix of fish and urine, but there are hidden treasures within!"}
{"text":"The only Chinese supermarket in Pittsburgh. Thank goodness it's well stocked. Unfortunately it's a 30 minute bus ride from school and hauling the goods back is not easy. I feel most at home here, it even smells Asian!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Asian market. Carries everything from seafood, produce, spices, and snacks. It even has that market smell when you step in. It's fair size store not very large and it can be a bit crowded on weekends. I think the prices are fair, the selection is good, and is probably the best Asian market in the area.   If you haven't been to an Asian store before then you should have a list and knowledge on how to identify items you want. Some don't have English translations on them. Overall, I didn't really have a problem finding items in English inside this store.   We'll be coming back to do more shopping."}
{"text":"i was very happy to find several of my all time favorite foods here! grass jelly, nato, seaweed bowties, kimchi, sweet rice wrapped in banana leaves, they also have cookware, frozen stuff, several oils, sauces,tea, rice varieties, buns, candies cookies and fresh vegetables and fruits! awesome! reasonably priced too!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time yesterday and was quite impressed with the massive selection.  I'm not big on Asian food but the tofu and veggies were worth coming here alone.  So much cheaper than Giant Eagle with a larger selection of tofu (which states it's non-genetically modified).    Please note: There's a $5 minimum to put on your card but you shouldn't have trouble with such a large selection to choose from."}
{"text":"Lotus Food is still my go to for cheap vegetables, tofu and Asian ingredients however the workers aren't the friendliest - don't take it personal. I went to a register, said hi to the woman and she gave me a glazed over look, not scanning anything which confused me. Behind me comes another customer who apologies and tells me he forgot some items. I told him that I was sorry too as I was not aware that he was still being checked out and he replies \"You wouldn't have known\" with a smile. And even through my transaction I continued to receive a glazed over look."}
{"text":"The Strip District isn't just about hunks of cheese at the Macaroni Co. or a 500ft line outside DeLuca's...there's much to be found at Lotus Foods! They are a Chinese grocery store with a wide variety of items and even food to order! Hubs and I just tried their carwheel cakes in custard, red bean and taro and they were cute-looking and yummers!  Prices are super reasonable here. The veggies are always so fresh and nicely packaged. On weekends, the tofu is FRESHLY made and only 40 cents a brick! They even have fresh quail eggs and several kinds of soy milk. They should keep their frozen wonton section stocked more because those are the bees' knees. I would recommend widening the selection of drinks too. I have seen a crazy selection at the Cleveland Chinatown stores so Lotus Foods could possibly take a leaf out of that book.   I do wish there was somewhere to park. It is seriously insane to find a spot because every Pittsburgher hangs around the Strip on the weekends."}
{"text":"If you love imported candy then this is a place to check out; they get some awesome season things in and of course they have a nice selection of Hello Kitty to choose from.  Best price on fresh tofu but you have to cut it and plate it yourself.  Fresh vegetables at AMAZING prices and tons of different potstickers (dumplings) in the frozen section.  It can get crowded at certain times on the weekend but I have never had an issue with rudeness."}
{"text":"Searching for Asian groceries in Pittsburgh? Lotus is the answer! It has the most extensive stock of Asian specialty products and produce compared to competitors in the area plus the prices are very reasonable. I have been coming here for years to stock up on noodles, snacks, sauces, and most importantly, tofu! They have a stand inside the shop with a limited variety of take-out items such as red bean cakes (so good!), tea eggs, and bubble tea. My one complaint would be their bakery section which could use some work. There aren't many options and their buns/breads usually look old and crusty by the time I get to them.   The store itself is a bit cramped, so it's a pain weaving through a sea of shoppers during the weekends. Oh, good luck dodging pedestrians and fighting for street parking during busy hours in the strip. Pure madness. The employees are all foreign so their English is not fantastic. If you have a question, just be aware that it'll take some time before you get an answer. I once played a 10-minute game of charades with one employee before I found where the grass jelly was."}
{"text":"Love this store! It absolutely stinks, but the prices and the foods you find here you won't be able to find anywhere else. Has the best sweet chili sauce. Beware though, rarely anything has english labels on it."}
{"text":"Everyone is always pleasant and the produce is always fresh.  I have never been disappointed in any of my trips to Lotus.  They have items that are not able to be found anywhere within a reasonable area, at such decent prices.  If you are looking for some authentic foods, this store is a must.."}
{"text":"If you've read my other reviews, you know that I almost never give anywhere 5 stars and almost never review any non-restaurant business.  That said, I would give Lotus 10 stars if I could!  There is no better grocery store (asian or otherwise) in Pittsburgh.  They have an all encompassing selection, including an entire 25 ft aisle solely dedicated to different noodles (I think that's what heaven looks like), and another length aisle dedicated to different soy sauces!  Whether you want asan mushrooms, exotic seafoods, asian snacks, fresh bok choy, asian cookware, chinese ramen soups, or 50 pound sacks of gourmet rice you will be right at home.  I always struggle trying to push my heaping cart,  heavy with asian mushrooms, tofu, noodles and dumplings up to the register, yet I've never had the total exceed $50, ever.  At whole foods you could blow that on an organic cocktail weenie.  Lotus offers, hands down, the best prices and the best selection of any grocery in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"This store is a foodie find!  They stock lovely Asian veggies, sauces, meats, and desserts.  I mainly come here for garlic, ginger, and bok choy.  I heard they have some very good frozen dumplings though.  And they sell steaming hot fresh tofu for $0.30 a block, YES $0.30!!  Everything here is priced very reasonably.    This is a great place to shop, but don't expect too much help from the staff.  Most things are not labeled in English, and the majority of the staff doesn't speak English, but hey that's half the fun!  You'll never know what gem you'll find."}
{"text":"I love this place. The managers are always very kind, stocked with so many different variety of fresh veggies, cakes, meats, fish and tofu. Prompt service, always a clean place. LOVE IT!"}
