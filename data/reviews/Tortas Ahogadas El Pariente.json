{"text":"I love Tacos!  This place is right around the corner from my casa. I come here at least twice a week their tacos are so freakiiiin good. I swear by them!  I love their tacos de carnitas. (pork meat) They add this special sauce to it which make them extra moist. I have never ever seen a place that adds sauce to their tacos.  The carne asada is made fresh to order.   Their best dish though is the Carne en Su Jugo. At first I was hesitant because I have never tried this, let alone heard about. It seems to be carne asada cooked in its own juices, along with beans and bacon.  Agggghhhh to DIE FOR!  I give them 5 stars because I have been here so many times and have yet to be let down.   Last time I was here tacos were only $.99!"}
