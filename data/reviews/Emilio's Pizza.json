{"text":"My new favorite pizza in Strongsville. Great sauce and salads. This our new go to pizza on fridays and for parties. I highly recommend this pizza!"}
{"text":"I work down the street and eat here often on Friday. I have enjoyed everything I've tried, sandwiches, wings and salads. I have not tried their pizza yet as I am from NY and I am a pizza snob. I'm sure I will give it a try eventually but I can't give it a thumbs up yet . That being said, the people are very nice and if you give it a try you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"As good as it gets!  For sure.  My favorite Pizza shop was closed today for the holiday.  I google searched Pizza around Brunswick Oh.  I found Emilio's!  AND I AM GLAD I DID!  Excellent pie!  Best crust I have had in a LONG time.  The drive (under 10 minutes) was well worth it.  I have found my new favorite Pizza!  Very reasonable prices on menu.  Even better after I enjoyed the Pizzas.  I HIGHLY recommend this Pizza shop!!!!!!!!!!!!  Vince.....Brunswick"}
{"text":"Great Lunch Menu!  Calzones are large and full of meat & other goodies.  The Gyro was also a great lunch item.  Glad I found this gem, their lunch prices are some of the best!"}
{"text":"Fav pizza in Strongsville! 

I'm a sucker for classics so I always go for pepperoni. I mean, if you can't get that right why even bother. 

They make a mean thin crust too! My husband doesn't like thin crust but he actually requests it a few times only if it's from here."}
{"text":"For a quick-time lunch, they have a bunch of reasonable priced specials making it very affordable.  I recently had their pizza (slice) and salad special, and added chips and a drink for a slight up-charge.

The pepperoni slice I had was huge, but had a rather chewy crust which is not my style at all.  The sauce and cheese were fine, but overall it was simply an average piece of pie.  The salad was made entirely of iceberg lettuce and some under-ripe tomatoes, accompanied by their house-made Italian dressing.

Again, for what it is this place will surely hit the spot for many...but for my own personal taste it just missed the mark."}
{"text":"Dave P is on the money with his review of this place. We've had pizza, wings, calzones, and salads from here. Not one of them disappointed us. The pizza has a great great crust and plenty of rich sauce, usually where pizza joints skimp. We got sheet pizzas for my kids birthday party and that was the first time we've never had leftovers(actually I was kinda pissed, that's usually my lunch the following day). If you live in Strongsville or Brunswick, and you don't go here you're missing out on one of the greatest locally owned pizza shops around."}
{"text":"I am from Detroit area and frequently visit family in Strongsville but have not been able to find good pizza!  This was average at best and the lettuce in the antipasti salad was tough!"}
{"text":"Not my \"go to\" but a good solid pizza option in Strongsville. Emilio's uses fresh quality ingredients and they offer plenty of options for pizza toppings. We have tried nearly everything on the menu and have usually been pretty satisfied. The wings are good but usually can be cooked a little longer to add some crispiness. They also offer a plethora of different subs both cold and hot. My favorite is the cheesesteak. Emilio's also offers pizza by the slice during lunch hours which is a great option. The slices are big, probably double the size of a standard slice. So if you are in the area for lunch or looking for a quality pizza at a reasonable price give them a try."}
{"text":"Pizza and wings are great. Staff is nice and orders are handled quickly. Pizza is amazing and ingredients are fresh. Best pizza in this area."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is good. Discovering this over the past year has wreaked havoc on my diet but I've enjoyed every bite. Excellent meatballs, great pizza, wonderful sauce, the best ingredients along with employees that actually care about their restaurant and your order make this the best delivery in Strongsville. Oh, and the house \"white Italian\" salad dressing is now my favorite salad dressing, anywhere."}
{"text":"We ordered a large meat pizza it was $19.99. I would call the pizza pretty much average nothing wrong with it but there was nothing great about it either. There was no WOW factor . Since I doubt I will go back to them I'm only giving 3 stars."}
{"text":"The skinny: good pizza and wings. I like the crust of their pizza, chewy but not overcooked. Wings are good as well. I want crispy wings and, unlike some places, they cook to order. Crispy should mean crispy, but its amazing how many places don't get that request right. 

They attend to the little things: Nice folks at the counter, good coupons, daily specials and a neat store. Glad it's nearby."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza pie! The dough must be homemade because it is pretty delicious and also the sauce has a very fresh tomato flavor.  The customer service is also great because the pizza arrived sooner than expected.  I highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Love the sauce. love the crust! I don't know what it is but you notice the flavor of the sauce in a good way. Crust is regular thickness but delicious. The supreme and ham/pineapple are my go-to there. One of the best in the area imo. Can't wait for my next pizza from there."}
{"text":"I can't give a review on pizza bc we only ordered subs, but they were delicious!!! 

Our delivery driver was very rude. He commented about us not giving him a tip, and we had!! I ordered online and added the tip to our total!!! Regardless, it's rude to say \"tip tip tip\" over and over again! 

Can't wait to try their pizza!!"}
{"text":"Emillio's pizza is right around the corner from me and my family gets it all the time, but it was my first time trying it.  We got 20 wings, 2 pizzas, and the chicken parmesan entree.  I have to say the pizza was really good.  The crust was the perfect texture that I love (i.e. not like cardboard).  We got a white sauce pizza and a red sauce, and while I loved both, I think the red sauce was a little bit better.  The wings were also really good, we asked for them well done and they were cooked great. The chicken parmesan entree was HUGE for 7.99, so definitely something that I'll investigate later on.  A little pricier than your generic domino's or pizza hut pizza, but well worth it!"}
{"text":"After leaving my review the owner of Emilio's offered to send over a re-do order on the house. I gladly accepted given the first order was so good. This time everything was cooked excellently. They recommended letting the order take know I wanted everything fully cooked and not soggy next time. Definitely would recommend from a customer service standpoint and from a food one."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best pizza in Strongsville easily. The Popeye salad is so yummy. I get their lunch specials from work a couple times a week and it's fast, fresh and always friendly delivery. 

Great menu variety, vegetarian options if you want those as well."}
{"text":"Emilio's had a great coupon for a super party combo. It took care of all my food needs for the party. The best part was, the food was awesome! Good job! I will use them again."}
