{"text":"Had the home-made longanisa. Was just alright. The fried chicken and lechon were very good though. Fast and friendly service. Good throwback tunes. Bathroom cleanliness could be improved."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to try the breakfast. I've been wanting to go for some time now. My wife being of filipino origin we had to try it . My wife ordered the Lechon & wafflesCrispy fried pork belly and coconut waffles with maple syrup and I the Tortang Corned Beef (Corned beef and potato omelette served with garlic fried rice and plantain chips) and a side of atsara. we both enjoyed our meals. We tryed everything from each others plates and we're quit happy . The only thing lacking from the experience was the service . The waitress seem to have a lack of experience and seem to have little knowledge of the menu. With only 2 other tables other than our she was in no hurry to tend to us . Our plates were empty in front of us for quit some time and I had to ask for our bill or i had a feeling we would have been waiting a long time .   With all that said I would go back, but this time I would like to try the dinner ."}
{"text":"Junior was an interesting dining experience. It's a very, very cute, little spot on Notre-Dame. The dishes are served tapas style but the portions are fairly large which is nice. We ordered little dry ribs as an appy which were good. The chicken hearts were nice and the fried offal was good but everything seemed to have a basic overlaying salty flavour. I feel the dishes lacked flavour layers. We tried about 7-8 dishes in all. Some were good, some were meh. The shrimp was nice. My glass of wine (9$) was very good but by far the smallest pour I've ever seen. So I chose not to order another one. I would come again to try the brunch."}
{"text":"My favourite meal is breakfast and my all time favourite breakfast is chicken & waffles so when I heard through instagram that Juniors had chicken & waffle I proceeded to plan a brunch there. Love the inside of the restaurant and the DJ had the place bumping! Didn't really look at the menu...I knew what I wanted :-) The chicken was good but could use more spices to make it more flavourful. I like my waffles bigger with deeper square, more room for syrup, but it was still delicious. Perfect combination of crisp outside while being warm and fluffy inside. It would of been disastrous if they served this with table syrup but they get the win with authentic maple syrup. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Called to get pick up. Whoever answered told me that they don't accept pick up orders over the phone - that I should just come in or call ALCE. Who doesn't accept pick up orders over the phone?! On top of that, the ALCE menu doesn't include the option for lechon kawali or escaveche."}
{"text":"Got a confirmed reservation through email for last night but then when my friends and I showed up, we were flat out told you don't offer reservations. Not cool."}
{"text":"Really like the food, service and atmosphere here, and have been back several times. My advice is to go with a group and order lots of things to share, like Filipino tapas! Favourites are the dry rub ribs and the incredible coconut milk ceviche. Brunch is really different and definitely worth trying. Prices reasonable and DJ spinning cool beats!"}
{"text":"Went on a weekday night  Decor: cute, colorful, themey, ++uncomfortable chairs. Service: Good, no problems Food: Got 3 dishes: pork shoulder, spare ribs, marinated-friend milkfish  Pork shoulder DO NOT GET IT. DRY, cadaverous. One of the RARE occasions in my entire life when I declined a doggy bag. I know.  Spare ribs: smelled good but DRY    Fish: smelled and looked good, decent flavour but DRY   Beer: amazing.  In summary, cute place, good service, good drink menu but DRY AS F*&K. Hope that helps."}
{"text":"We left Junior very impressed and very satisfied with the entire experience. Very attentive waiting staff who were pleasant throughout. Food was delicious and plentiful - we shared a starter,  main and dessert which was more than enough. My girlfriend, a master baker who is Filipino too, really enjoyed the Cassava Cake. No doubt we will return."}
{"text":"I went to Junior's for the chicken and waffles  and OMG ... It was amazing. The chicken had that perfect golden colour and oh so crispy. The first bite came across a bit salty but once you pour some sirup on... The flavours balance out. The waffles now, they have flaked coconut mixed into the batter making them sorta sweet but not too much. I'm def going back for more!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good if you're seeking Philipino food. I tried some lechon, chicken adobo, and something else. The chicken was really really good. The lechon almost killed me: just way too much fat in that dish, its crazy. Things to watch out for: Massive family gatherings with kids running wild, cold temperature in the winter (bad insulation), very heavy dishes. Otherwise great spot, would return in the summer for beers & a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"My family and I were in the area and we were looking for a Filipino restaurant and found this place.  Walking inside reminded me of the restaurants in Portland, Oregon as they reused old furniture and tableware.  Total hipster vibe. They have an outside patio in the back but we decided to dine inside since we had an infant with us.  There is house music for your listening pleasure.  We were there for Sunday morning brunch so I thought it was a little too early for it.  Apparently the chef is also a DJ.    We all ordered the \"silogs.\"  I had the tocsilog, which consists of tocino (cured sweet pork), sunny side eggs and garlic fried rice.  Their silogs come with a simple green salad with vinaigrette dressing and fried plantain chips.  It was delish.  However, we were served lukewarm coffee.  Service was good though.  I would give them another try when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant with very nice ambience and specially like their playlist. I really like the vibe here.  Back to main point, their food is decent. I really like their mango salad. It is a simple dish with mango, tomato, and onions with a tasty shrimp sauce. Lechon (roasted pork) is a bit bland on its own, but it is good with one of the sauce on the table. We also had deep fried fish and noodle which are not bad."}
{"text":"Perfect comfort food on a drizzly day. Simple yet tasty dishes. I ordered the cornsilog, garlic fried rice with two perfect sunny side up eggs and corned beef. Happiness in a plate. The salad on the side was a little odd with the other flavours on the dish but I guess I have to eat my vegetables! The service was prompt and friendly. Can't wait to go back for some lechon, pancit and longanisa."}
{"text":"Came for brunch and it was awesome!! The coconut in the waffles was a great surprise! Service was fast, friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"I was pretty exited to try this Filipino restaurant since my other half is from Philippines.  Unfortunately this failed:  - the lumpia are NOT good, this is usually one of my favourite dish, knowing how delicious this can be that was an epic fail. - the music is VERY loud - feels like you are in a night club in the middle of the day which does not make any sense...made me want to eat as fast as possible and never come back.  why not opening a night club instead?!  On the bright side, the decor is cute, nice patio at the back, some dishes are ok and you will probably like it if you never tasted Filipino food before. That's all you need to know!"}
{"text":"Tried this place about three times now as its very close to my place. It seemed to have lots of potential. Dishes seemed interesting, prices are ok (especially for Griffintown), portions decent. But there was not one dish I can say I loved, in fact Ive eaten filipino food several times now and Ive come to the conclusion that I just dont love their flavours. They tend to use alot of shrimp paste I believe it is and its a little overpowering.  I tried the Adobo Baboy (pork Shoulder) , Adobe Manok , Pinakbet which had bitter melon in it  which I really dont like, its really an acquired taste. And Palabok which was probably my favourite of them all but still not very good. As much as I dont love it here I will be back to try the brunch, I hear the chicken and waffles are really good...."}
{"text":"15$ for two tiny bits of unseasoned chicken, 3 cold waffles and some fruit slices. The waitress asked us twice if we wanted something to drink but never if the food was to our taste.  Definitely not traditional Filipino, not cheap and not to be recommended. You seriously might as well stop by KFC."}
{"text":"Brunch of champions. Need more protein in your life? Tired of the same old brunch menus? Junior has you covered! That's right, everything from fried chicken, to house made sausage to Filipino pork and fried rice. No boring eggs on toast here!  A friend and I came here after a yoga class. In our post yoga glow, we thought what better idea than to eat fried chicken (it made more sense at the time). So we headed towards Junior.   Although I am not a big meat eater, I do really enjoy a non-standard brunch. My friend ordered the waffles and fried chicken, which I was very sceptical about. I mean who eats fried chicken for breakfast? I think this is one of the those, you need to try it to believe it, because wow, was I wrong. The waffles were deliciously light and fluffy and the chicken was a really nice compliment. Don't get me wrong, I probably won't be switching up my overnight oats for fried chicken any time soon, but this was definitely a tasty and unique meal.   On my side, I had the sunny eggs on a bed of fried rice, with sweet and salty marinated pork, pickle, plantain chips and a salad. Yep, all that for breakfast. Everything was delicious (minus a little too much garlic for my taste). Also, I left the restaurant so full I didn't want to eat for the rest of the day.   The space is eclectic and fun and the music was a great mix of old school hip hop, rap and r&b."}
{"text":"Went here on Canada Day for brunch . Loved the decor . It was raining so sat inside although they have about six picnic tables at the back . Menu makes a refreshing change from usual breakfast items. Coffee was refilled a few times. I ditched the tea as I have just started the choose to refuse single use plastic free challenge and milk, stirrers and sugar were all plastic . Price was reasonable  at $15,00 per plate."}
{"text":"Man this place was gewwwwwwd!!! We just left from brunch there and it was delicious! I am so tired of shitty, greasy brunch food or generic dishes and this place is such a good escape. First off, they have a DJ spinning Motown and soul and hip hop music so it's super cute and atmospheric. Second, the service is great. Our waitress was so nice and accommodating and knew the menu inside out. And finally the food was A+! Both dishes we got were really delicious and flavourful. The fried chicken and waffles were great. The waffles aren't super chunky and retained a lot of moisture and a unique flavour. It was an all around really great experience and I'll 100% be returning."}
{"text":"After my first experience at Junior which had been disappointing and I had not been there since.   Last night I was walking down Notre Dame and in need of a little snack, so we decided to stop in at Junior and give them another try.   As this was truly for a snack we only ordered two items and a small bowl  of rice. We had the Lumpiang Sariwa, a thin crepe with tofu and veggies in a sweet sauce,  and Ginasang Sitaw, fried green beans with veggies in a salty red sauce. We really enjoyed both dishes and the sweet and salty mix turned out to be an excellent combo. We will certainly be back to re-explore more of the menu.   To boot we sat out back on their patio and had it all to ourselves."}
{"text":"Mention spécial au superbe décor avec des couleurs éclatantes et des graffitis. Le service est ok. Le prix du vin raisonnable. La bouffe était correcte mais sans plus, pas pour justifier une future visite. Petit détail: on a eu froid tout le long du repas. Un peu tannant. C'est l'hiver quand même!"}
{"text":"Some of my favorite spots are confusingly three or three and a half stars on Yelp, so I'm up for giving these places a try. But with Junior, things just did not pan out. Junior, this review is out of love for you and food and diners. I want it to be a success! My best guess as to why our experience was such a flop? I suspect the chef quit. The guy cooking our food in the semi open kitchen was wearing sweatpants...  I came in around 6 on a Saturday and there was only one other table. A little concerning, but the layout and decor of the place seemed promising!  Our waitress promptly came to our table and apologized for not coming sooner because she was outside smoking. She honestly came so fast I can't imagine how she could have come sooner. And no matter how long it took, customers probably don't need to know it was for a smoke break! She was super friendly, though, and helped explain the menu and gave recommendations. Maybe back on track?  My husband ordered a beer that was pretty good, but my cocktail tasted like cheap gin mixed with pineapple juice. I'm no cocktail connoisseur, but this was just so simple and cloyingly sweet.   We ordered the ribs and the shrimp/noodle dish, which is where it really fell apart for us. I'd read on Yelp that the ribs were dry, but (unsolicited) the waitress assured us they wouldn't be. But then they were! We only got three ribs with bones, the rest was just little dry bits. The sauce had decent flavor. The noodle dish had puny shrimp - not seared or anything - and just generally had no flavor beyond bland veggies. Not to be a snob - I'd totally eat this food for take-out at a significantly lower price. But it seemed like a mean trick for the price and vibe of the restaurant.  The only customers to come in the whole time were two friends of the waitress. And we left at a little after 7 on a Friday!  I really wanted to get a taste for Filipino food and am a pretty open person when it comes to new foods and flavors, but this food and dining experience was just not good at all. I sincerely hope they can turn this place around!!"}
{"text":"Best chicken and waffles! Staff is wonderful too! Oh, and the cocktails are delicious too. I will be back for sure! :)"}
{"text":"I have known so many Filipinos in my lifetime, but I've never had the chance to try their cuisine.  Have I ever been missing out.  I was really surprised at the different flavours and combinations in their cooking!   Juniors does it right!  The food was absolutely delicious!   Great food, great price point.  The beer and wine selection is great.  I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Place was empty when we came. Food was bland (got pancit and lumpia). Did not have palabok available. The service wasn't too bad, but don't think we would come back again."}
{"text":"I wanted to try Filipino food and always walked by this place - so, I finally decided to try it for brunch. I got the chicken silog, which was pretty good. The fried chicken was really good, very crispy outside and juicy inside. The only thing that I wasn't a big fan of was the rice which was pretty dry - again, maybe this is how it is supposed to be since I haven't had this cuisine - but, I would much rather have something with gravy and rice or like fried rice."}
{"text":"For the longest time, Filipino food had mostly been seen as comfort food, understood and loved almost exclusively by Filipinos themselves. Maybe a little lumpia here or some pancit there allowed the mainstream palate a safe gateway. Even then, most places I had been to that served Filipino food had it displayed behind a glass, sitting all day in hot trays, not the most appetizing food presentation in my opinion. Despite all that, for Filipinos like myself, our food is an endearing taste of our childhood, all that soury, salty, pungent, strangely textured stuff on our plate a delicious way to connect with our past.   In the past few years, Filipino food has (finally) begun gaining recognition in the culinary world. Filipino fine dining establishments have popped up in California and NYC, receiving rave reviews. Being from California myself, I wondered if I would find the same thing after I relocated to Montreal. When I asked my friends here if there was such a thing, the resounding answer was, \"check out JUNIOR.\"  I've been to Junior twice now, once for dinner and more recently for Sunday brunch. The proprietors of this establishment are young, Filipino-Canadians who have framed the place in modern culture while still maintaining the integrity of our homeland. There are times where there's a DJ spinning 45s. There's a taco night. But the food and feel is PURO PILIPINO. And for that, I can say that JUNIOR is legit.   Food-wise, I've tried two things, both of which I loved:  Buto-Buto: this is one of those foods Filipinos consider \"pulutan\" (food that you drink beer with). Bits of pork meat on the bone seasoned and fried to perfection. Enjoy with one of their bottled brews and get taken away to an evening with the homies along a beach in Southern Tagalog.   Fried Chicken and Waffles: The waffles, if I remember correctly, have a little coconut in them, which couple perfectly with these crispy, juicy pieces of chicken. You might want to ask for extra syrup :)  All that said, extremely thankful to have a spot in town to sit and enjoy a little bit of home. Mabuhay!!!"}
{"text":"??????????????????!!?????????????????!!?????????!!???????????????????????"}
{"text":"Super hip, super trendy, super good! One of the best filipino restaurants I've ever tried outside of the Philippine. After not having filipino food for so long, this place really took me back! The sisig they had was fantastic as well as the leche flan. We ordered so much that the owner/manager gave us brunch coupons for next time. Definitely would come back again!"}
{"text":"Food wise, it was okay. I like the dessert but wouldn't give more than 3 stars for the main course. Main course doesn't come with rice, but no where in the menu mentioned about it.   Service was okay, not too content with the tone of the waiter because he answered our questions as if we should've known how it works, what comes with what, etc."}
{"text":"Decided to try something different.  Restaurant is cute the DJ is a cool thing to. But our waitress didn't really help us as we weren't to familiar with what to get.  Our order was given to the wrong people I got someone else's.  It's expensive for what it is.  I didn't enjoy any of it.  Would I come back.. No!  Happy I tried it ? Meh"}
{"text":"SOO GOOD. I'm Filipino, and was so happy to find Filipino food in Montreal while I was visiting. The food is legit. Tastes like my mom's cooking :) The owners are brothers and they are so sweet and down to earth. They're also both DJs and play amazing music. I had the pork adobo and Batangas cocktail and was oober pleased."}
{"text":"May be it's the jetlag, but I found few restaurants I tried were rather b l a n d. Enter Junior, that gets it right, from friendly staff to the 'we are not shy with the ingredients to make it as authentic as the ones in the Philippines.'   Definitely a must visit eateries if you happen to be around the neighborhood. Awesome and super tasty food!"}
{"text":"Legit Filipino Tosilog/Longsilog/Tapsilog breakfast. And some fusion, such as lechon kawali and waffles. Hip and culturally accurate décor, and even NBA summer league playing on the TV. Just like a real carinderia in the Phils."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for dinner, brunch and takeout. I like the food. It's comfort Asian food. Some dishes are packed with flavor, some are perhaps too greasy. Overall, I'd say it's a good spot if you're looking for a quick, affordable weeknight meal and want something different. I'd definitely recommend the pancit (rice vermicelli stirfried with small shrimps, veggies and fish sauce) and sweet sausage."}
{"text":"We really loved Junior and are surprised it only got three stars. Our experience was great. It was a Friday night, The DJ was awesome and the place is funky and hip. Our waitress was sweet and french and like, that iconic, adorable, Indie film French...She suggested 3 plates and two pints and we went for it. The dry garlic spareribs were just a touch sweet with the perfect balance of chili and salt and then Bang! the garlic. We had a chicken that had a curry based sauce. The french adorable waitress said to get some rice, just to eat the sauce with, and she was so right. Wow! That sauce ROCKED and the chicken was cooked perfectly. I also love that the plate consisted only of thighs and legs. And the noodles were good too. I hate salty food and it was not, not greasy either. This was my first time eating Pilipino so I'm no expert, but good food it was."}
{"text":"First time having chicken and waffles and happy to say that I had them here cause they were BOMB.   Lets talk food: The chicken legs had a nice crunchy exterior while keeping the meat moist and juicy. Waffles provided a nice fluffy texture that contrasted very well with the chicken legs.  Service was excellent! Water was refilled and order to table was around 10-15 minutes tops.   The only issue I have with the place is that the portions felt a little small for the price. Maybe another side dish or something to really fill it out. Anyway an enjoyable and pleasant experience at Junior!"}
{"text":"The first impression one gets when walking into this new & funky Filipino restaurant in Griffintown, is a sense of community, family, and culture. From the classic Hip Hop / House music playing, to the good looking smiling people, one knows they are in for a treat. This place reminds me of a really cool joint in Nyc called \"Tacombi\" with the VW Van parked inside it. There is a simplicity to the environment which makes one feel comfortable and at ease, with the staff that are eager to please. The menu selection is unique & delicious, from the coconut chicken to the fried fritter with shrimps in it! Price point is very reasonable, and drink selection (alcohol & non) is also out of the ordinary. Montreal superstar DJ brothers Jojo Flores & Toddy Flores are part owners in this venture, and with their \"PR star\" sister Bic helping serve the meals, you can't help but feel good about this family affair. This place is a welcome addition to the burgeoning Griffintown restaurant scene!"}
{"text":"Food was good, no doubt. Generally the vibes were OK. Service was super rude, we were border line bullied!  First , the little princess(who turned to be related to the place owner) refused to issue separate, per individual, bills(despite we asked her to do so upon our arrival). Then ,she started screaming at us  because she didn't bother to count the money in her hands and assumed those who paid cash didn't left enough tips!  The staff apologized to us , the last scene i saw before leaving the place was her  screaming at another client face because he interrupted her while she was giving orders to the waitress!"}
{"text":"L'ambiance est vraiment cool, mis à part pour la grosse télé sur le mur! La déco est colorée et évoque la bouffe de rue aux Philippines, avec son kiosque et ses grandes enseignes. Menu du midi intéressant et pas trop cher, mais ma portion de vermicelles aux crevettes et porc (Palabak) était pas mal petite. Mention spéciale aux bières de micro québécoise en bouteille!"}
{"text":"Finally came here for brunch and was not disappointed. The atmosphere is cute and trendy, small with colourful decor. We got the chicken and waffles, as well as the tapsilog. The chicken and waffles were amazing! The crispy juicy chicken on top of waffles, drizzled with syrup, was done perfectly. The beef in the tapsilog was a bit tough but it was extremely flavourful. I also found the garlic fried rice pretty interesting, it was all kind of stuck together in one mass. I dabbled my plantain chips and garlic rice with the various sauces provided: banana sauce (it's like ketchup), \"all purpose sauce\", and pinoy spice. All the sauces were tangy and fun! I found the dishes a bit pricy, but compared to typical brunch places it's pretty standard. Wished we got some drinks but the cocktails were expensive. Would like to see a variation of sides for brunch too! Someday I'll need to try the other main dishes offered like the lumpia and sigig."}
{"text":"Situated on Notre-Dame street, Griffintown, Junior is a cool little Filipino restaurant. It was my first time trying Filipino food in a Filipino restaurant. To be honest, I haven't really tried anything on their menu; how come?  Well, we actually went for their specialty called: Kamayan. It's a very traditional Filipino way of eating. First of all, you need to call about a week in advance to reserve a table for it. They need to prepare all this in advance.  Second, once the day comes, you show up, they lay down banana leaves covering the whole table. First, the rice. Then it's meat, after meat, after meat. Sausage, pork ribs in a sweet spicy sauce, lechon (which is basically roasted pork belly with a very very crispy skin), deep fried fish, shrimps, spring rolls, fried chicken, and to top it all off, they sprinkle some green beans on top. Gotta have some greens in it right? And finally, you eat with your hands. No forks, no spoon, no chopstick. Everybody dig in with their bare hands.  Overall, the food is amazing. It's a great experience to have. It might not be for you but you gotta try it once.  It's 35$/person and obviously, not vegetarian friendly."}
{"text":"Never thought Id say this but I kinda like pig ears.Very nice decor ,in the summer time the back of the restaurant is beautiful and brings you somewhere tropical.Nice staff with Dj sets."}
{"text":"Wanted some Filipino food while visiting Montreal. This seemed like a popular choice so we checked it out. Best way I can explain it is it's a hipster joint serving semi authentic Filipino food. Worth checking out if you like Filipino."}
{"text":"We were a table of four and we got what the waitress recommended us. We ordered 4 dishes, 2 side dishes, and 1 large pot of rice. Originally, we were going to eat our dishes on our own but decided they were sharing dishes. There was the Buto Buto (dry honey ribs) $12, Lechon Kawali (pork crisp belly) $12, Adobo Baboy (braised pork shoulder) $13, Palanok $12, Vegetable roll $7, and last but not least. papaya salad (idk the price). We ended up paying 27 dollars each without tips. Keeping in mind, we got three drinks. There were plenty of leftover food and we ended up taking a lot home because it was so delicious!   I highly recommend Buto Buto dish if you are getting a bunch of side dishes. Some might think it's a bit on its own. If you're one getting just one dish, I recommend the Adobo Baboy. You can pour some of the sauce over the rice. The crispy pork was also good too, but slightly on the unhealthy side.   There was only one waitress on the floor but she was attentive and super friendly. I think her name was Kelly. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place as it has been in my radar for a very long time now, so we walked in with a bunch of friends on a Wednesday night to order a few dishes and sample some of the popular cuisine. The space is cool, great wall art, and a real laid back fun vibe.   We got seated and waited for a while to put in our order; there was only one waitress for the whole restaurant on the floor that night so it took a while. We ordered a few drinks; cocktails were okay overall but nothing great, really.   We tried placing an order for food but we're told that the highlighted items were no longer available; thanks for saying this the first time around. Second time around, we ordered the fried pork rolls, a veggie crepe, the adobo chicken with side of sticky rice, and the honey garlic ribs. The food overall was good, nothing great, and not as flavourful as I hoped. The best dish was probably the fried pork rolls which were super yummy with the side of dipping sauce, and the adobo sauce which was great over the rice; you could taste the ginger which I loved!   Overall, the food was okay and affordable for the quantity for this part of town. I enjoyed the venue and concept of Filipino street food but was only impressed with half the dishes we ordered. The service was super friendly but slow although the food came out quickly after our order was placed. I'd probably go back to try their daily specials, as the Wednesday tacos seemed interesting but probably not anytime soon."}
{"text":"I won't lie the first time I was here , I didn't enjoy the food much but it was because I didn't order the right things that didn't really go together. After having talked to a few of my friends and them not sharing the same opinion , I decided to go back and give it another shot and it was worth it. I got the fried pork and waffle which was delicious . I would absolutely go back and the vibe at this place is awesome ! Reminds me of my travels in Southeast Asia!"}
{"text":"For this year's (very late) Christmas dinner amongst close friends, we reserved a table for 10 people to experience the \"Filipino way of eating\" - a kamayan party. You had to call a week in advance to reserve so they can make sure to cook enough food. The experience was pleasant, the food was tasty and the employee was informative and offered a good service. A kamayan party consists of banana leaves laid out on the table to serve as \"plates\"... rice is placed in the middle and covered with vegetables and many proteins (fish, shrimps, chicken, pork, beef). The whole point is to share the food with your friends and eat with your hands. Everyone enjoyed their food and had a great time.  Price: 35$/person"}
{"text":"Affordable, fun, and trendy.   There's a new growing trend in the Montreal food scene: small restaurants with the simple goal of serving good, specialized food. Junior does this for Filipino food, and it's awesome. Nothing pretentious, just awesome, affordable food with lots of love.    Looking for a fun and trendy experience with friends? Junior."}
{"text":"The Filipino inspiration is there, but I felt that there were missing flavors. For example, the palabok tasted watered-down (as if the noodles were not drained properly) and the egg was scrambled rather than hard-boiled. The lumpia was too big for lumpiang shanghai, it needed more salt, and it lacked the flavors and texture of onions and carrots. My favorite dish was the sizzling sisig. Again, I felt that it wasn't the same as the sisig I eat with my uncles. Nevertheless, it was hot, spicy, and flavorful. It worked for me. If it's your first time eating Filipino food, it's definitely worth trying. If you're a Filipino craving for something akin to lola's home cooking, it won't alleviate your homesickness. Although the food was not what I expected, I thought it was tasty (rather pricey in my humble opinion) and I want to come back to try their other dishes and brunch.  My biggest critique is the service. The servers were friendly in the beginning. As the crowd grew, they had less time to attend to the customers, which is understandable. But at the end of the night, when there were less people, the servers did not recover. They handed our bill without asking if we were ready, they fronted an annoyed demeanor, and I felt disrespected.  I commend the chef for the food, and would like to return again. I just hope I receive better service the next time I visit."}
{"text":"This place is great if you go at an odd hour. Went for an early dinner and was really pleasantly surprised! We were recommended 4 dishes for the two of us, but 3 proved to be more than enough. The prices are not bad for the portion sizes and the back patio, general decor, and music is really fun and laid back. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I stumbled across JUNIOR looking for a brunch place, and it was so cool. I had the Lechon with Waffles -- delicious and filling! The vibe here is cool too. Retro filipino but not pretentious. Casual."}
{"text":"We came here 15min before they closed and very grateful they still happy to take us.   We ordered and food came out quickly, hot sizzling and burst out of flavor in the mouth. I haven't eaten Philippines food before can't say if it's authentic.   + stir fry noodle with chicken and shrimp: hot and tasty, the noodle don't break in small pieces like other restaurants.   + sweet honey pork ribs: crispy, hot , a little bit chewy (don't know if it's Phillipines style or not cuz same dish in Vietnamese food supposed to be super soft tender)  + rice for extra $3 (this I'm not happy about, it should Be complimentary come with the pork)  + stir fry string bean with ground pork: fresh string bean  + Manila sunset cocktails: I'm not too happy with the price $10 while main dish is $12 a little bit pricy for that small size cup and weak alcoholic level but my man said it's good. Mainly sweet for those who like sweet cocktail. This is why I rate it 4 star    Total bill for 2 main, 1 side, 1 cocktail and 1 coca: 69 before tip."}
{"text":"Un service impeccable et des plats savoureux !!! Le brunch est aussi vraiment bien et tout est fait maison"}
{"text":"I don't know what everyone is complaining about. This was as good as or better than most meals I've had in the Philippines, with an atmosphere to match. The sisig was crispy, the pancit was, well... pancit. And while the lumpia might have been cooked from frozen, I'm pretty positive that they were still homemade.   This isn't fine dining, but damned if it's not satisfying."}
{"text":"The quick and dirty answer: Yes! Delicious, great service, easy atmosphere.  The long and detailed version: We stopped in here after a 6 hour drive from NYC. The waiter told us the kitchen was closed (it was 10:45pm) but directed us to a nearby pub that served food late (Lord Williams and their bacon cheeseburger was BOSS). We did want to try the food so we stopped in a couple of nights later.  The same gent greeted us and much to our surprise, remembered us. He gave us some food recs and we weren't disappointed. The chicken adobo was tender, flavorful and went perfectly with the simple rice noodles. Liang, taro leaves in a savory coconut milk sauce, was suggested and he even pulled out a couple of spicy options to satisfy the souther Italian in me.   There was plenty of food at a decent price which was great tasting and served quickly. Don't miss out on this neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"I can't even begin to describe how horrible this place was. The food was insanely salty and over priced. Not to mention that the service was also terrible on top of that. My waitress was extremely pushy while we were ordering our food and then showed no interest in us after we had our meal served. I am also of Filipino descent and can for sure say that this is no where close to how my family would make these meals. Overpriced and not worth it, Won't be going there again."}
{"text":"We love Junior!!! Their brunch service is amazing and very generous, it reminds me of being in the Philippines. They have the best plantain chips as well. The service is awesome as well, very fast and efficient. I highly recommend Junior even for dinner service, their pancit palabok is sooo good."}
{"text":"I know very little about Filipino cuisine and by little I mean none at all. The one fella I know who's been to the Philippines shook his head and said, \"To be honest, it's not very good\" when I asked him what the food there was like. So I've never been in a hurry to get to the nearest Filipino establishment. To begin with, they're not exactly ubiquitous. But today I had my first taste and the experience totally made me want to go back and try more things! My friend and I went there for brunch and we had the fried rice platter. Hers was with sweet cured pork (oh my yum!) while mine was with soy-lemon marinated beef, which tasted a bit like something I would've had during my childhood in Indonesia. The salad dressing was nice and sweet, which complemented the garlicky rice. The banana chips were very pleasant as well. The portion was generous, which was definitely a plus. The food, the service and the ambiance totally made for a legit island cuisine type place and as for that dude who told me Filipino cuisine was not very good, obviously he didn't know what he was talking about!"}
{"text":"Had to re-do this one.   This place is the perfect combination of Asian meets comfort food. First you must have one of their cocktails cause after all the decor screams Beach Bar!  My top dishes are : salmon ceviche, pork sisig, and the panabok  so so good.   Honestly, I would go back and do it all over again."}
{"text":"Yo! This place is good. I don't know why it only had 3 stars on Yelp when I went. Seriously though it's super cute inside and the servers are on point and adorable (re: half Asian early twenties good looking urban hipster types). The food is good too and there are tons of choices for vegetarians. For real though I'm definitely going back it's low key and fun and not expensive."}
{"text":"Junior is the sharp contrast in the gimmicky gentrification of Little Burgundy. Even though it's fairly new, Junior's tenure is timeless. Great food and amazing vibes orchestrated by an avidly vibrant staff. Don't be scared to commit to an array of plates, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Went there today for brunch it was all delicious. The flavors, the meat and the LECHON its a must try.  I found their page on Instagram and I came all the way from NYC."}
{"text":"Anyone paying attention to the Montreal restaurant scene has probably noticed the fact that between Griffintown, Little Burgundy and St-Henri, Notre-Dame Ouest has boomed restaurant-wise. The number of new and awesome places that have opened up over the past few years is staggering and difficult to keep up with. I've had my eye on Junior, a Filipino restaurant for a while now but hadn't truly made the time to visit. Over the holidays, getting the Montreal Cooks cookbook - a great book by the way - and trying a recipe from Chef Dre Mejia made me more anxious to go. This month, I finally find my moment to give them - and Filipino food - a proper try.  I went both for a late night snack and then for their \"Rice n' Shine\" brunch on the weekend. I like the overall visual style of Junior - a indoor street vendor. Very colourful elements all around and the in-house DJ is a nice touch. I enjoyed the selection of music both times I was there but it was a little too loud on my evening visit. When it is hard to have a conversation at the table, it's not a good sign.  To start on my evening visit, I went with the dish that brought me there in the first place - the Adobo Baboy - Soy-Vinegar braised pork shoulder. A nicely hearty portion of wonderfully tender and fall-apart pork. Perfect braised texture. The sauce is very strong on the soy so could be too salty for some of you but the vinegar helps to tone it down and creates a light finish. Add some sweetness, acidity and saltiness to the fatty pork. Very enjoyable - my imitation version just didn't match up!  One of my friends chose the palabok - rice noodles with pork and shrimp gravy. This was sadly a big disappointment. It looked good but surprisingly had no real flavour - the noodles felt overcooked and only the egg served on top came through taste wise. The gravy provided nothing and the pork and shrimp felt brand and lifeless.  Our third dish brought us back on the right track. We went with the Daing na Bangus - Baby Milkfish marinated in vinegar and garlic, de-boned and butterflied and pan-fried. First thing that hit us was the texture. Moist and flaky, the fish came apart so easily. The use of vinegar and garlic provided some sweetness and a little kick flavour wise.  2 out of 3 wasn't what I had hoped but it was enough to come back for brunch with my sister. We first had the Longasilog - fried rice, sunnyside-up eggs, sweet pork sausage, plantain chips and atsara. A solid dish all around - I really enjoy the sweetness of the housemate sausage and how it mixed well with the runny egg and the rice. The plantain chips provided some crunch and the atsara a little bitterness. Very homey and filling.  We also had the fried chicken and waffles - jollibee-style fried chicken and coconut waffles with maple syrup. This dish stood out a little more. As much as I hate coconut normally, the little hint in the crispy waffles worked really well and the fried chicken was outstanding. Loved the crunch of the skin and the overall moistness of the chicken.  I'm happy to have finally been to Junior. It was great to try some Filipino food and realize how I do enjoy it and would like to come back. On the flip side, it was really disappointing to have a dish fall so flat on us. Junior is a solid part of my neighbourhood and a cool addition to the culinary scene in Montreal. Nice to have a generally underexposed cuisine be brought forth like this. I will be back Junior - I just hope that one blip was just that.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"*** DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY ***  I ordered delivery from Junior using ALCE. My experience was mixed but somewhat negative overall.  I'll start w the bad: the delivery experience was terrible and I don't believe it's ALCE's fault. I ordered 4 items: 2 rice noodles, 1 pork adobo w rice and beans, and 1 pork belly w rice. They were all stacked together w the pork w rice and beans at the bottom of the bag - this was the only dish w liquid sauce. Result: the bag got soaked at the bottom and as the bag was removed from ALCE's carting case, it collapsed... yielding a mess (thankfully, the food was salvageable... but I had to clean the mess). Who stacks a liquid dish at the bottom of heap like that? Why not just use two bags. You know what, I'm ok if they charge me for the extra bag.  Another bad: my order was incomplete (I think). The website claims it comes w sweet Mang Tomas sauce. Either it's invisible or it was omitted. The net result was an ok dish w unmet potential. Again, this is not ALCE's fault since they didn't pack the bag.  The positive: the food was decent. Not great, but fine. Surprisingly, I felt the rice noodles were the best item - despite my strong ex-ante personal inclination towards the pork dishes.  Verdict: I may try again, but definitely not w delivery. I will still use ALCE for other restos since many of my experiences w them (indeed, even the person who delivered this particular time) have been positive and painless. The problems (due to carelessness, I think) were mos def on Junior in this case."}
