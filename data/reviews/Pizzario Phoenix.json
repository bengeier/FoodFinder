{"text":"Excellent customer service! Love the pizza - would eat it every day for lunch if I could! Lots of great options. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I used a food delivery app to order spaghetti and meatballs, and the penne pasta with sun dried tomatoes, as well as the garlic knots.  I was pretty disappointed in the overall flavor. The sauce in both pasta dishes was bland and the noodles were over cooked, almost mushy. On the contrary, the garlic knots were undercooked and doughy, and served with refrigerator-cold marinara. None of it was delicious in any way. Just edible.  I guess the good part was that it was hot when it arrived, and the prices were low, for what it was.  Wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"In from out of town and recommended by colleagues. Garlic knots are phenomenal. Must have. Being from Chicago, but living in Los Angeles for years, this was a refreshing surprise after a wind down after a long few days of work. Pizza was excellent, this coming from a pizza snob, and meatball sandwich was just as good. It was national meatball day so we had to give it a shot. Apparently there is a national day for everything these days. Wife was happy, clearly made my night even better. Delivery fast and professional. They do catering as well and will definitely consider this for our companies future events. Well done"}
