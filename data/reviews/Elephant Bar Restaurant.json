{"text":"Went here looking for a new place to eat for date night. What I found was not was I expected in either atmosphere or service. The place is perfect for a nice dinner out, we sat for over an hour and it felt like 20 minutes, the feel, lighting and service was above what I expected. Our waitress was great; Lucy acted like we were her only customers even though there were plenty of full tables in her area. I never had to ask for a refill on my drink, as soon as I was close to empty she was bringing another to the table, she suggested her favorite dishes in all categories and was polite and attentive throughout the meal but not overbearing. I will definitely come back to this place again."}
{"text":"Limited menu.  If you are watching your salt intake.  This is not the place to go"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience! I went to the Elephant Bar years ago at Christown Mall. And was leery about trying it again, but our waitress, Shara, was so helpful and a pleasure, it added to the good food and we'll be back"}
{"text":"The waiter was not attentive at all. We had to ask for refills during our visit over and over. One person would ask for a refill and he wouldn't even bother asking anyone else if they wanted refill before he walks away. We had to wait for him to come around again and basically give him our whole drink order again.   When he finally brought a drink back, instead of putting the drink on the table by going around the person, He forces the drink cup between two people budging their arms. Come on, walk around to the other side or say excuse me or something.  There was no you're welcomes involved. We would say thank you for taking our order or bring our food out and he doesn't even nod nor do anything. You wonder if anything is in his head at the moment.  Food was mediocre.   Then the bill came, for a party of 6, he added a 20 percent gratuity charge; which would have been fine if that was their policy. I looked at the menu again as I was walking out and realized that the waiter was a scumbag. The menu clearly states 15 percent for a party of 8 or more. I bought that to his attention. He said \"oh, let me take care of that.\"  He came back with 5 dollars and some change and said; here I charged 15 percent this time.   No no no...big mistake to keep on messing up at this point. I pointed it out AGAIN, that it clearly states a party of 8 OR MORE.  Fine, he said. I'll give you the whole thing back; which was the right thing to do in the first place and let us figure out how much he deserves since we literally had to ask for refills for each person otherwise he wouldn't refill the drinks.  Here is the real kicker, he apologizes for this and said, \"I asked the person who paid and she said she was ok with this gratuity charge.\" WHO IN THE WORLD, ASKES THE GUEST IF IT IS OK TO ADD A 20 PERCENT GRATUITY CHARGE AHEAD OF TIME...especially if the gratuity charge is meant for a party of 8 or more. There were 6 of us, and NONE of us remember him asking this kind of nonsense about the gratuity especially since he didn't even say thank you or acknowledge that he understood your request. And even if he did ask we and all 6 of us happen to not hear it, why would we agree that.  The manager was a joke. He did absolutely nothing; nothing what so ever. He was there when the waiter gave us 5 percent back of the 20 percent and he seemed fine with it.   Someone is in need of some training; the manager and the waiter. The whole experience was just horrible. I would not ever ever recommend anyone to be served by him John Maz"}
{"text":"The worst experience of my life.  Food was absolutely terrible.  Husband ordered a burger was raw inside.  My breakfast was gross and just horrible.  Appetizer was under cooked.  Never ever again"}
{"text":"Love this place. The service was great; the food was great we had garlic chicken Alfredo and Marcu salmon shrimp and noodle soup delish. Plus did I mention the service was spectacular and the drinks were good. We had jungle colada and elephant bar Margarita. YUM"}
{"text":"I came to elephant bar with my friends for dinner. Was a hoping place to be for a Saturday night. Our server vince was busy as the outside area was full but took the time to make us laugh and have a good time. Food was excellent and service was awesome. I'll be back and my friends will too."}
{"text":"Ate here last night for a large birthday party. Ordered a NY strip steak and specified that I like it well done, no pink whatsoever and that if they needed to butterfly the steak then it's perfectly fine (cutting the steak in half to open up the center). When I got my steak, I cut into the center and it was entirely pink and immediately blood gushed out all over my plate. The reason I prefer well done, is because blood makes me incredibly nauseous. I asked the waitress to correct it and she took it back.  Brought it back out about 5 minutes later and it was barely a change. What surprised me most is that they didn't just start a new steak and bitterly cut it as I had requested. Instead, she came back out with the same steak, now almost entirely black!! The inside was well done of course, but my steak was a completely dry, chalky hockey puck. I just boxed it up and took it home for my dogs. I understand that when asking for a steak well done, it will be dryer than usual. But because of the constant on and off the grill my steak at elephant bar was like jerky. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Food was terrible and service was even worse.  We will not be back....there is a reason this place is going down the tubes."}
{"text":"Well after reading all of these lukewarm reviews,  I guess I'm very lucky. I've never had a bad meal here. I usually order the crispy teriyaki chicken & it's always excellent.  Even if there's only two bites left I want to wrap it & take it home! My son always gets mac n cheese & chicken tenders and they're so good I always have to eat one of them. My only complaint is with the service.  My waitresses always seem to act as though they're waiting on me just to hurry & get it over with. On one visit the young waitress took my plate away when there was food still on it....I wanted to take my leftovers home!! I was pissed!! My most recent visit my waitress rushed away after we each ordered an entree. I wanted to order an extra order of chicken fingers for my son as his appetite has grown to adult size. My friend had to call the waitress back (Katrina) where she abruptly asked \"you don't think he'll have enough chicken in his kids meal?\" Umm....No...that's why I'm ordering more!!! Don't worry, I'll pay for it!! I love the food here but the service leaves me to believe that everyone hates their job in there."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming to the Elephant Bar for years, bringing our relatives and friends whenever they visit. We were highly disappointed when we were told that our favorite server Vanessa was no longer working there. Her cheerful, friendly attitude was our reason for coming there. Without her there we will not be returning in the future and will pass on to our friends and family this is information. If she returned we would consider returning to your establishment."}
{"text":"The food was ok.  Service was a little slow and not very attentive.  I went with the family and the kids thought the place looked pretty cool but other than that they left saying they never wanted to go there again."}
{"text":"The four of us all ordered either salads with grilled chicken or chicken sandwiches. Everyone's chicken was completely dried out and super thin. It was like a three day old piece of pounded out chicken breast. Pretty gross. We went for dinner on a Saturday night and it was totally dead. When we got there a few tables in the bar were seated with couples over 70. By the time we were done the dining room was about half full with only people over 70. I guess it's because of the area? I will never go back to this place. It was disgusting and the worst meal I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"By far this is the worst service I have ever had!  I sat at the table for 43 minutes before anyone acknowledged me, and that was only after a friend complained about the service.  The manager was rude...I've had better service at taco bell!  Will never return,  and will tell everyone with a pulse to avoid this place!!! I would have ordered food, but since it took almost 45 minutes to get a drink...I didn't bother and left for a place more customer friendly"}
{"text":"Our server Joe was wonderful! We had a great experience and wonderful food. We suggest the French Onion Ribeye sliders - we were able to get them for free by signing up for a free rewards program. Overall, great experience!"}
{"text":"Wow, didn't see the bad reviews until I was looking it up on Yelp when I was already there waiting to be seated lol.  The hostesses were a definite fail. They took a couple of minutes to even look up to greet us. Took another minute for them to even take our names down.  We were seated next to a large party of high schoolers heading to their homecoming or something. They were loud and boisterous but thank god they left about 10 mins after we were seated.  Our waiter Tom, was very nice and enthusiastic. I was quite surprised after reading on Yelp that this location's service sucked.   I got the jambalaya and it was pretty good. The shrimp was cooked perfectly.. but definitely not spicy enough. The brown rice was kind of on the dry side. The boyfriend got the misoyaki salmon and to be honest.. it looked a hell of a lot better on the menu! The bf's mom got the french onion soup and sweet potato fries. The fries were really good!  I got a drink called Road to Lahaina. It was pretty damn good. It had mango puree and some pineapple juice with captain morgan. (MY FAVE!) :)  Overall, pretty good food and the service was not too bad either."}
{"text":"Great place for a girlie lunch! Had a wonderful salad and dressing on the side. The server actually remembered. She wasn't pushy or did not try to push us out fast. We had an enjoyable lunch with glasses filled promptly. Quiet at the lunch hour which was nice so we could actually have a nice conversation. Definitely a place to go back to!!!"}
{"text":"Typical slop house in which the management is nonexistent and the cooks are to busy to do their job's. Never send anything back or you will receive your meal back totally trashed as the management serves up apologies, but for whatever reason, cannot determine that he is handing you a plate of recooked garbage.   My most recent visit started with an undercooked steak which my partner insisted that I send back. Upon receiving the meal back the steak was charcoal and had the consistency of leather. I have learned my lesson after my third visit and will dine elsewhere in the future.  My advice is to stay away from this joint, the atmosphere is nice but as a restaurant this place is a failure."}
{"text":"Dammmnnn Danielle! She was a great server and very attentive! Definitely will come back and sit in her section. The food was also very good!! Overall 10/10 for service!"}
{"text":"Don't know why  don'tI just go here first. PFChang's will take reservations but you still end up waiting and food takes awhile to get. Lucille's is nice but packs out pretty quick and you just can't eat that heavy all the time. Elephant Bar has quick service, friendly servers and an unusually wide variety of menu items. Never a problem."}
{"text":"Came for happy hour, ordered 3 appetizers, 2 tall beers & 2 mojitos for $35! Great deal! The waiter even came back to our table 5 min after happy hour was over & asked if we wanted anything for last call. The chicken lettuce wraps & Korean beef tacos were great! We will be back!"}
{"text":"i can only speak about the happy hour food at this restaurant which are all of the appetizers.  i've eaten 1 other time here in the main dining room. ok, during happy hour, the appetizers are 1/2 off. the appetizers are outstanding. you can only get the half off in the bar area, which is also decorated nicely like the restaurant. these aren't ordinary appetizers. there's excellent calamari with a unique dipping sauce, coconut crusted shrimp (large shrimp), an asian flavored chicken & nut lettuce wrap (sizeable amount), and a variety of other appetizers. the appetizers are always good and each are under $4.50. drinks are reduced in price for happy hour. i've always had good food here. the one time i dined in the main area, my meal was large and good quality and was fairly priced. i would give this a big a+ if you are looking for quality appetizers at 1/2 off and sizeable drinks at reduced prices. the main dining area is attractive, different, and they offer alot on their menu."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and the prices. It has been awhile since I have been there but service was good. A few hiccups with food prep but the server took care of us right away. Would have been 4 stars if not for food hiccups."}
{"text":"Love this place! Had dinner tonight and had a great time. Teriyaki chicken is to die for! Appetizer we had the chicken pot stickers and desert was the ice cream mud pie. Soooooo good! From appetizer to dessert."}
{"text":"Extremely noisey, undercooked rice, chicken very salty and dry, just not a good experience! Plus, we had 7 adults and a 1 yr old and they squeezed us all in a booth! Unbelievable! On a positive note, the ice water was very good!"}
{"text":"My food was amazing and I had the \"Kona Kooler\" to drink which was very tasty. My father's food came out cold, so he spoke to the manager and he was very understanding. My father ended up just getting a salad and then dessert. On the bill, they took off the original cold meal, salad and dessert! The waitress was very nice and apologized. Overall the staff was very kind."}
{"text":"Food were not bad, more on the pricey side for the quality they deliver. Service was mostly bad, the kitchen staff/food runner was very good. Server failed to refill water , bring out our order, just not attentive after the food being served."}
{"text":"Good service. The waitress was friendly. but the food was just icky and the Place smelled bad! like sewage pipes. I had a glass of wine. there was no way I was going to order a mixed drink while she was tearing the bar down.  I didnt feel good after eating the food. I had a coupon so it made the total bill cheap. But i would have walked out if I had to pay full price because The atmosphere they boast should provide better food.  No Not good dont go"}
{"text":"My family has been here a few times over the past few years. Essentially, every time we attempt to give this place \"another chance,\" we are sorely let down. Put simply, while the food is mediocre (i.e., nothing special), the service ruins this place. Our most recent trip resulted in a wait of 15 minutes before our drink/entree orders. While not too bad, the waiter never returned to refill our drinks. We didn't see her again until after we notified the gentleman that brought our food out that we needed refills. Essentially, she took our order and left - only to return to collect payment. It was a bad reminder as to why we avoid this place."}
{"text":"Happy hour was great. They have excellent beer on tap.  The burger was freaking outstanding! Good proportion of meat to bun.  Unless you want ginger to be coming put of the pores in your skin don't eat the lettuce wraps.  The service at the bar definitely 5 stars. I will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Had lunch today with my wife and grandson experience was fabulous! I had the pot roast excellent wife had chicken tacos fabulous grandson had cheeseburger loved it children's menu has everything on it and includes drink and dessert what a deal.Can't wait to go back ! Wish they would open one on west side"}
{"text":"With a large menu, everyone in your party is bound to find something wonderful to eat!  Every item I have had on the menu has been delicious and a complete delight!  The flavors are expansive and the desserts...YUM!  The Crème Brule is divine!  The atmosphere is inviting and adventurous.  The bar has a very large selection of spirits and beers.  The staff has always been friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and professional.  The management is regularly seen on the floor and every time I have been in, he/she has come by to check on me and my satisfaction with my meal and service.    I go to the Elephant Bar and Grill at least twice a month and am trying to get a weekly girl's night out set up there!  The happy hour is perfect!  Oh and the fact they are involved with local events and fundraising endeavors by local non-profits gets an A+ in my book!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Elephant Bar twice- once before prom and once just for a date. The service was very good on both occasions, so going with a big group is safe! Their crème brûlée is to die for and I've had a good variety of their menu from sharing with other people and I was very impressed. I've ordered both the Mozzarella & lemon herb marinated chicken sandwich and the Citrus salad with grilled chicken, and ended up in a good mood. Their rainbow trout was awesome and I don't even like fish. Also, free refills on strawberry/raspberry lemonades make me very happy, so all around a great place to go- especially with their email coupons!"}
{"text":"So, I love happy hours. Beyond explanation. You can imagine my excitement to find out that happy hour is from 7 to close.   Needless to say, we ordered. A lot. Too much. BUT, in my defense...it was like impulse shopping - impulse dining.   Anyways.   I ordered a bloody mary, to get my tummy prepared for the onslaught of food that it was about to receive. Also, the artichoke dip, sliders and tacos.   Clock ticking.  Excitement fading.  Tummy growling.  Irritation growing.   Finally, the bloody mary arrives! Or should I say tomato juice. No celery salt, hot sauce, worcestershire sauce, ANYTHING. Except for a whole fucking celery tree that was engulfing the glass.   Boo hiss.   The rest I shall summarize:  Artichoke dip = large jar of mayo. Again no flavor.  Tacos = soaked in \"sauce\" (aka mayo)...couldn't taste much besides that.  Sliders = ok. Just ok. Meat reminded me of what I imagine wet dog food to taste like.   So, why the two stars you ask? Well..I added one star for the cheap drink prices during happy hour (stick to beer, maybe).   Now I shall find my giraffe and ride off in the sunset, in search of some good food."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch at noon on Saturday and was surprised at how empty it was, only a few other people in the place. We found out quick why! The service was terrible, we sat there for a good 20 minutes before someone finally came over to get our drink order. And waited another 20 minutes before we got them! It took another 40 minutes to receive our lunches and all the orders were wrong. I ended up simply returning my order and not ordering anything else. I would understand if the restaurant was full but there were a total of 6 or 7 tables besides ours so that is no excuse. Will not return."}
{"text":"I was visiting from the east coast when my friend a local, asked me to dinner and cocktails as we were in the east valley he suggested the Elephant Bar as he frequents the Elephant Bar in the west valley, and had always raved about how great the service and food was. I was so excited and looking forward to the good food, drink and ambiance! We were seat and ordered cocktails and appetizers, then our entrees. The waiter was very nice, so as we contemplated dessert I asked if I may move to the patio and smoke. The waiter said of course, so we left our jackets and my friend accompanied me outside.  It's a nasty habit and I hate it, I am very respectful and really try to go as far away from anyone to light up, which I did. There was a family dining outside so I went to the opposite side far edge to light up. A waitress came rushing outside and loudly asked me to move to the side of the building, which I did. I was a bit startled but hey, no problem. The same waitress not 3 minutes later ran after us and again, loudly, accused us of leaving without paying our bill! I was stunned! I told her that we weren't finished and wanted dessert that's why we left our belongings in the booth. I reminded her that at her request we moved to the side of the building to smoke. My friend was furious and I was appalled by the discourteous service this waitress gave us. I never would have gone outside if I hadn't been told it was ok to do so. I have enough sense to not light up near anyone trying to eat; I was not near them at all, and the topper was to be accused of theft! No dessert for you! Wow! I've since moved to Phoenix but I will NEVER return to the east valley, Chandler Elephant Bar again. Did I say NEVER? EVER!"}
{"text":"We have frequented this establishment several times now and have never been disappointed!  The food is delicious, has a wonderful presentation,  always served in generous portions, and is reasonably priced.  Their service has always been excellent with a very attentive and friendly staff. We have brought friends and family to this restaurant as well and every time each visit has been a positive dining experience. The atomsphere is pleasant and well maintained.  They also offer an outside seating area if you enjoy that type of experience.  Unfortunately,  some people have given this place some lower review ratings. I find it comical when reading other patrons reviews and hearing what their complaints actually consist of.... Example: \"too many items on the menu to choose from\",   \"I don't like laminated menus\",  \"you get too much food\",   \"I felt overwhelmed with their menu\".  Absolutely hysterical to hear people actually complain about things like that!  That only goes to show you that you can never please everybody!   Perhaps MacDonald's would be a better choice for their taste in general..."}
{"text":"Atmophere, service and drinks were very good, but food needs improvement.   My husband  really liked the Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi-Mahi.  The crust was perfectly crips, but in my opinion the sauce was kind of bland, almost no hints of tamarind (as the menu says).  The brown rice was that - just plain rice.  I ordered the Pan Braised Rock Sugar Beef With Pappardelle Noodles - the beef was very though and dry, the sauce was just good but nothing exciting.  The manager kindly offered to give me something else, so I ordered the Fire-Grilled Lemon Garlic Chicken Breast but the chicken was chewy and though, the sauce was good, the mashed potatoes were salty, the vegetables were bland.  Even though service was very good and they did not charge me for the two plates I ordered, I am not comming back."}
{"text":"The Elephant Bar is located in the district across from Anthropology, and offers a new American dining menu. The interior is a safari motif with huge palm fans and larger than life animal structures. There is a bar off to the left, always full of business types, and if you can find a table, I suggest grabbing it. Sometimes the wait for the main dining area can be close to an hour on a busy weekend evening. The bartenders are usually pretty attentive as well. The shrimp trio platter is a great appetizer, and I always enjoy the fajitas for my main entre. The mixed drinks are seriously amazing. I have never gone wrong with any of them. Don't order wine or beer here. Order their signature drinks. The cute one with the ring of raspberry around the glass is my fave (sorry, I can't remember the name right now, but they will know what your talking about if you decide to order it.) My only complaint is that sometimes the hostesses are a bit...ahem...snooty. But I guess I would be too if my job was to jam pack a million hungry, thirsty patrons in the restaurant every weekend!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has deceivingly beautiful decor. Looks like a nice restaurant, comparable to The Keg, but the cheap prices of their food matches the quality. I got their shrimp scampi jn lobster sauce and it literally was like a frozen dinner meal. I've had lean cuisine meals that were better quality. Fine service but the food leaves a ton to be desired."}
{"text":"Thank you once again to Geoffrey I went back to give you guys another try and I must say it may have been the time we went before or something but everything was nice and hot this time...my server Lucy was on point checking in often....thanks again for not disappointing"}
{"text":"OK The Location is a 10. It is a VERY FAMILY FRIENDLY PLACE. ON PAR WITH OLIVE GARDEN FOR KIDS. I find the food tasty at a VERY reasonable price. The portions are large and the service is prompt. I recommend the salmon and the chips and spinage dip appetizer. Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"We got caught by rain after the movies and decided to pop in for dinner- soooo not disappointed.  We ordered at 630 which gave us happy hour prices. My man got a burger, fries, and a beer for under $8. According to my burger aficionado the burger was a 4.5 stars out of 5. I had the tuna appetizer and it was divine. Jose gave us amazing service even though his section was full so be sure to ask for him."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place.  They have wonderfully amazing food (really, that good!) and great prices for the quality.  I have been going here since they opened and dropped off some coupons at my workplace -- never heard of them before that... however, I have been hooked since then!!  For a recommendation -- Sweet Potato Fries, ***Honey Mustard Chicken Salad*** (this is totally my fall-back, it amazing!!), Lemon-Garlic & Herb Marinated Chicken Sandwich Caprese, Wok-Fired Mongolian Beef, Sauteed Chicken Marsala, and ... well, I can't seem to find my favorite dessert but it was this gigantic cookie and ice cream monster.  Perhaps it was just a seasonal item."}
{"text":"Traumatizing experience - BEWARE:  We went here for dinner and ordered the dinner Wok-fired specialty entree: Crispy Honey Shrimp and Mongolian Beef.  Appetizer: warm and spicy artichoke dips.  Food is overly expensive, too salty, too fried, and felt very unhealthy, making us ill afterwards with intense stomach pain.   I feet like I swallowed a large lump of coal.  I'm thankful for Advil.    On a happier note, our server is very nice and accommodating; food came rather quickly.  Regardless, there are definitely better restaurants on Bell Blvd."}
{"text":"One of the most underrated restaurants in north Phoenix / Scottsdale. Amazing happy hour food and prices, stop by if you have never been."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst meal I've had in a really long time, and I'm not the on to complaint about food, ever!! Literally everything we ordered tasted old and rubbery. I had the Ribeye Sliders, and the French onion soup, SO DISAPPOINTED. Our server was very nice and did a great job but unfortunately the food was absolutely disgusting. 2 thumbs down."}
{"text":"We stopped here before going inside the casino for lunch.  I had the tomato soup with salad and garlic bread.  It was good for lunch."}
{"text":"Went with my partner on a Saturday night, it was busy but got seated within 10 minutes, the staff was very attentive. My only real criticism is that there is not much room to move.  I ordered the Indian shrimp with brown rice, it was a little spicey but tasty. I loved their appetizer choices, we went with a flatbread mini pizza. We did not have any cocktails but the next time we go will definitely get one."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre, nothing so special where I would crave it, but they are good for happy hour where the prices drop down on both appetizers and alcohol a the bar.  Many people enjoy them because the food is varied, so it is good for large groups.  The location in the district makes it a good location for special events as well."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Our server Jose was the best he made us feel at home. The food was great and the service was even better!! Thanks Jose."}
{"text":"My favorite terriyaki chicken EVER...Get the crispy terriyaki chicken and you shouldn't be disappointed!!  I never am."}
{"text":"Love their happy hour.. servers are very courteous and nice.. ambiance is good..will come back soon"}
{"text":"I went to the Elephant bar this afternoon with my parents for lunch- Well, it was lunch for me but since my parents are in their early 70's now it was actually dinner for them- yes, dinner at 3pm, I know.  Anyway, they love this place and have a few favorite dishes they say are delicious and keep them coming back- along with a 20% discount for seniors they get there.  My first impressions aside from the place being empty at 3pm was the decor was tasteful and inviting. We had a nice half circle booth.  Our waiter showed up immediately and provided very good service throughout the meal.  I ordered the \"Ultimate bacon cheeseburger\" with fries. My parents shared some chicken parmesian medallions with pasta dish which they said was very good. Looked good to me- nice portion size and presentation.  My burger was pretty darn good. Half pound patty done medium well with bacon, cheddar and all the usual trimmings. I think they used a slice of sweet vadalia onion which gave a nice sweet note to every bite. Overall a very good burger that I can easily recommend. A nice size serving of seasoned fries were a nice addition to the meal- very crispy hot and tasty.  Prices here seemed to be very reasonable as well. My burger was only $8.95 and looking at the menu, most sandwiches were in that range with full dinners mostly under $20. Seriously most of their meals were cheaper than you'd find at a Denny's or similar.  I'd definitely give this place another visit. Seems like a good place for a casual date that wouldn't stress your credit card."}
{"text":"This so bad! My husband and I walked in ordered a beer, hot tea and nachos without beans. 20 minutes later we get the nachos with beans so my husband asked if we could get them without from a different server because our server went on break. The manager came over and was so rude and blamed everyone else for the mistake. Because of the management I would never go back. He yelled at the bartender for trying to help us with our order!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour . Great Desserts. I don't care much for the main courses.  Wait time can be a bitch on weekends. Staff is courteous and friendly . One of the better casual dining establishments in the East Valley. Did I mention the awesome desserts ?"}
{"text":"I've always loved Elephant Bar and was so excited to find this one while on vacay.  The food was amazing the atmosphere chill, but the best part of my meal was my funny, energetic bartender Kristy.   She kept us laughing while providing stellar service.  I wish all bartenders were so awesome."}
{"text":"Received incredibly rude service here last night.  Waitress was not knowledgeable at all, and was very annoyed by our questions.  She actually was so visibly upset and had so much attitude, she refused to wait on us. She passed the table on to another worker, who did a great job making the situation less awkward. It put a sour note on a relaxing evening out with my hubby, and it was pretty difficult to relax and enjoy the meal after the encounter.  I was so shocked I wrote to corporate, and have not received a response.  The food is mediocre at best. Needless to say I will never be back. You are better of spending your money anywhere else, so you can actually enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! My friend and I had originally been sat in the dining room, but it was a nice day out and we wanted to go to the patio, and they accommodated us quickly and they were very friendly about it. Our server Ashley A. took great care of us, she was on top of our every need without being overbearing. Her timing with everything was perfect. Overall it was a great experience and I will continue to come here."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with 25 girlfriends the weekend of Phoenix Open WM 2013.  As busy as they were, they still gave us Great Service, they split the check for us (yep) the manager \"Leo\" made sure we got what we wanted & the food was just Delicious! I will definitely go back there again & again & again!"}
{"text":"The food was great, the ambiance was great and Jamie, our waitress was great. Go here, eat lots, tip well and prosper!"}
{"text":"Arrived around 5pm and were seated quickly, they sat us in the back of the restaurant where there was a huge party.  I don't understand why because the rest of the restaurant was open.  After waiting 20 minutes with no server we walked out."}
{"text":"Horrible server. I ordered a salad and received a totally different one. The server was unaware of the ingredients in menu items. The floor was extremely dirty. The food quality was not great. Will not return here."}
{"text":"Went with a party of about 35-40 women. Service was really good for having that many people to deal with. They put us all out on their patio which accommodated us all well. They had some heaters out there to chase away the chill. I thought the food was a bit pricey. As well as the draft beer. However the salmon dish I had was great! The atmosphere inside and out was really nice too."}
{"text":"I've been to the Elephant bar twice and have never had a good experience. While I love the safari ambiance, which reminds me of the Rainforest Cafe in Arizona Mills, the food was lackluster. The restaurant's Web site (elephantbar.com) advertises that 'The menu is unforgettable' but this is far from the truth. My burger was too well done here and on my second trip the Fire Grilled Mahi-Mahi Sandwich didn't sizzle with flavor like I anticipated.  Take the Elephant Bar for what it is -- a fun place to relax with a drink in a unique ambiance. Just skip the food."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.  Wok-Fired Chicken and Lettuce Wrap was really good, but everything else was blah.  Artichoke dip was like melted american cheese.  Chicken marsala was dry and didn't have a simple marsala sauce (not a good choice on my part, but I figured it's a simple dish, so would be a safe item.  Lesson learned!)  Not sure what we had for dessert, but it was a small scoop of ice cream buried in a ton of whipped cream.  Loud.  Server was good about refilling water."}
{"text":"I wish I didn't have to even put one star.   We walked into a non busy restaurant. There were tables open everywhere. Yet we received a buzzer and was told I'd be sat momentarily.  Once sat at our table, we were greeted by an extremely energetic waiter that spoke a mile a minute that thought he needed to emphasize that everything was AWESOME. (including my side of avocado that he dropped off later during service) Once we ordered our cocktails I realized it was super cold in the restaurant. So we asked to be re-sat outside. (which 5 min later two other ladies complained and did the same thing). My boyfriend and I started with the \"sashimi\" grade tuna appetizer. The tuna was warm, chewy and grainy. GROSS! So we quickly returned the item in fear for food poisoning. We then replaced it with the spinach and artichoke dip. How could you go wrong with cheese dip?? Blagggh! The cheese was awful and we dug around the dip to find ONE artichoke! So, we wanted to be nice and just pushed it to the side. Shortly after, our salad came out. We were excited to eat the salad because it actually looked appetizing. BUT, we received no silverware. So as we waited for our super speedy awesome waiter to come back to ask for silverware, our burger arrived. Aggggh! So now I have a hot burger that I need to eat and no time at all to eat my salad. As my boyfriend is putting on the jalepeno relish he finds a piece of paper in the relish. Geeezus! So by then we were irritated and asked for a manager. They comp'd our meal but, crappy waiter, REALLY crappy food. Won't ever be back."}
{"text":"Want good appetizers and desserts?  Looking for a themed ambiance?  This place will suit you.  Want great entrees?  Um....  We've been coming here for years, but less and less more recently.  Our most recent visit was 2011-05-07. From an ambiance perspective, it delivers a sense of the Spice Road.... an asian flavor through different asian cultures - prepared for western taste.  Elephants (go figure), animal prints, funky overhead fans... you get the picture.  Throw in a bar and tv's for the sports gurus, colored lighting, and now its east meets west. We ordered from the specials they were running on our most recent visit.  Lettuce wrap and calamari delivers.  Vietnamese rolls were less successful.  Salads were good - it's kind of hard to screw up a salad.  Entrees we ordered the ribeye steaks.  Not impressed.  Here's a hint:  the ribeye steaks are cut so thin that they'll dry out quickly when cooked; even medium will result in shoe leather (yeah, I ordered medium).  If I'd known it was cut so thin, I'd have ordered medium-rare to give it a fighting chance.  Desserts are advertised (for the special) as a mini-brownie or ice cream in a wonton cup.  Uh... \"mini\" and \"wonton\" give the wrong impressions; these weren't one-bite wonders - the \"mini\" was a decent size portion (wonder how big a \"regular\" size would be!).  Wonton skins are about 3\" across; these were more like spring roll wrappers (8-9\" across), deep-fried into a cup shape, dusted with cinnamon sugar, and a large scoop of ice cream in the center - topped off with garnishes, of course. Overall, it's decent appetizers, salads, and desserts; hit-and-miss on the entrees.  We've lost some favorites over the years, didn't care for some other elements, and generally \"accepted\" it for what it is.  Can't say I'm a fan (hence no 4-star, although I'd have given it a 4-star years ago), so now it's an \"yeah,it's okay\" - or 3 stars."}
{"text":"I loved my Jungle Colada and the option of Caesar salad with my burger instead of fries. The food was great and the atmosphere was fun."}
{"text":"WOW!  Tasty foods.  Refreshing drinks.  PHENOMENAL service.  Going back again.  Came here on a Friday night around 9pm with the gf.  Seated right away.  Edgar was the server and man was he GREAT!  Drinks:  Mojito and Mai Tai.  Both were perfectly made all the way down to the last sip.  Appetizer:  Chicken potstickers.  WOW!  Talk about delicious!  Dinner: She had the grilled steak and I had the thai style tilapia.  Talk about flavor with every bite!  Dessert: Freshly baked half chocolate chip and half macadamia nut cookie topped with ice cream... Need I say more?  That was my second time there and it sure wont be my last!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch.  The minute we walked in the smoke smell from their kitchen was offensive.  There were very few dishes under $13 and the portions are way too large.  Don't they understand people who pop out for an office lunch?  Even their \"lunch specials\" were $12 to $16!  The food quality was mediocre.  The waitress was excellent but, I wouldn't go back as there are so many other places I prefer."}
{"text":"The perfect fusion of East meets West , the Elephant bar blends delicious cuisines together to make delightful meals! Such as their Kona BBQ baby back ribs with chicken breast finished off with a lovely creme brûlée for dessert!"}
{"text":"Great service. Good food. I liked our server a lot. The citrus chicken was delicious. Our favorite is the teriyaki chicken and five spice chicken."}
{"text":"The food as just OK. We had 2 meals. Thai High chicken stir fry - the sauce was unbalanced somehow (too sour?), although I suspect that it comes premixed from their central supply. The second dish was Korean chicken and BBQ ribs.  Both meats were a bit dry, and the bare chicken pieces were unattractively presented on a pile of rice. Both looked like they could use a sauce and a presentation tweak.  Service was very good."}
{"text":"Mike, the Manager, responded to our concerns and showed a profound and caring response to a less than perfect experience not long ago. He really cares about our kids serving in the Middle East too. Mike put together a wonderful gift box for our Son and a beautiful card signed by his staff thanking him. Elephant Bar deserves our patronage. Thank you Mike!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came in last night for the first time and were served by Daniel, he gave us a menu tour and provided excellent service. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to many Elephant Bars but this one has to have the worst service of all of them. If they would have given me a survey I would have certainly let them know"}
{"text":"WOW- What a fantastic experience my family and I had at this restaurant! The atmosphere was friendly, clean, and the food was amazing. The entire staff was welcoming, starting with the receptionist and all the way up to the General Manager. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone and we will definitely come back! Five stars for sure for me."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE. The waitress was verbally slapping me, all I did was ask for a water and a Coke.. she said why do you need two drinks?  Like what are you even asking for? My buddy decided he was susho rolls she said you know we have burgers and actual food!  She was awful!!  but the food picked up some of the slack!"}
{"text":"Our order arrived relatively speedy. The server was nice, providing five star service. What was especially nice was the availability of tables - on a Friday night; a payday night no less. Probably because everyone was over at the Firebirds Wood Fired Grill LOL  However, the Elephant Bar was good!! I had the orange Peel Chicken and it was delicious!!"}
{"text":"They had bad service and I order a meal and they said so I wait. Then when they serve the rest of the family they say they don't have the meal I wanted. So I got mad and ate nothing but appetizers."}
{"text":"Yum! This place has the most unique atmosphere, I love it! Went here after The Adventure Run for their special happy hour and ruly enjoyed myself. The decor is really authentic and urban and the bar area is insane with the lighting and graphics. I ordered a big burger and was pleased, not over the moon thrilled, but satisfied.   I highly suggest the happy hour menu. The food is cheap and delsihcious and the drinks are a good price too. Got a very worth it, very strong Marg for $3. I was just so impresed with our waiter too. We had a large group and he was really attentive and ok with al the check spiltting and plate sharing. Good guy."}
{"text":"Food was great but the service leaves something to be desired. Server took 15 minutes to greet us. We ordered drinks and meals at the same time. Came back 15 minutes later with flat soda and lipstick stained coffee cup. Said the delay was because he was waiting for a fresh pot to be brewed.  Never came back for 30 minutes. When we found him inside, he said our food was coming right up. 10 minutes later food arrived. Food was very good. Manager came over and said he would take care of the check and get dessert for us. Guess what? He never came back either. We just left.  Nice place, great tasting food but good luck with the service."}
{"text":"I wholeheartedly agree with Tom I. from Placentia, CA - Joe at Elephant Bar is extraordinary!  While the food at the restaurant is excellent with lots of options, Joe makes your dining experience SPECIAL!  He is welcoming, engaging and truly wants you to have a superb meal - whatever it takes.  Yes ... go to Elephant Bar for the delicious food and fun atmosphere - - and if you're lucky enough to have Joe assist you, you're sure to have a memorable meal!"}
{"text":"Very bad service. Bland food. We had to wait forever for even booster seats. Some dishes were okay but some were messed up."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm a born and raised Vegas kinda girl, so I always had looked at the Elephant Bar with a little respect and nostalgia from the days it was on Maryland parkway and had fancy topiary...those shrubs outfront cut in the shapes of animals. Well, those days are gone. I went for a friend's birthday.  She chose this place because she was craving the taste of their raspberry lemondrop. The service was poor & the food felt like it had died under heat lamps. Boo Elephant Bar Boo!"}
{"text":"We frequent the Elephant Bar for fish and Ahi and other different delights.  Service varies on the visit.  The bar area itself is the best place normally.  The food is consistently very good with a nice variety.    Linda was our server tonight and was nice."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  After eating here a few times, and loving it of course... The food is always great, the service is fantastic and the menu is wowzers, BIG.  There are many choices and it's fun to share and sample, as the food portions are large.  In the summer, stay away from the beautiful semi-enclosed wooden benches in the back.  The air does not circulate well inside of them and I almost melted.  Yay! I'm a fan!!!"}
{"text":"This place is just awful.     When we got sat outside we had to go inside to find someone to come out and take care of us after patiently waiting fifteen minutes for someone to approach the table.   Our server was absolutely horrible.   Everything took forever and she told us some horrible story about how much she didn't like working there, and how bad things were going in her life.  When we complained to the manager about the food taking forever, she said she would take care of it, but then nothing happened.  When we finally did get our food, it was borderline gross.  I'm sure it might have tasted a little better if we weren't all completely disgusted with the overall experience to that point.    I tried to find the manager at the end again to give her a summary of how crappy our evening was, but she was no where to be found.  I'm usually able to tell if a place is just having a \"bad night\" but considering that the place was hardly a third full, and nothing went right from start to finish, I have no problem telling everybody and their uncle to stay away."}
{"text":"The best thing was the dessert. Shrimp was alright. Nothing to write home about. Wesabi chicken was lacking."}
{"text":"Great time, Good Food!  Staff works their butts off and is top notch!  Ask for Angie"}
{"text":"First time eating here. I was just walking with my family and just decided to eat here. Brandon was our server, food was fast to our table and services was Awesome! We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good! They have many vegan options if you ask! Waitstaff is friendly. My friend ordered the chicken marsala, but said there was too much fat on it. I ordered the garlic noodle dish, minus the shrimp. Even the half-order at $5 was too generous a helping, but sooo very good. There were approximately 15 other people at our table, as it was a friend's birthday dinner, and everything looked phenomenal, really. I'd definitely like to go back often if I wasn't so distant from chandler!"}
{"text":"Great Vibe, excellent Happy Hour. However, we went for drinks and appetizers the other night, asked to sit outside, and was told that we had to wait 45 minutes. THE PATIO was EMPTY ! We went to Lucille's instead, and they let us sit outside."}
{"text":"The night I was at  this location with a party of eight we receive great service. Food was fresh and was at our table in adequent amount of time. Ordered two rounds of drinks along with soft drinks for the entire table. Drinks strong and good, food nice and hot service a thumbs up I will be back thank you"}
{"text":"Went there for my boyfriend's birthday and the service at the bar area was simply awful. It just killed the mood.  At first they didn't accepted official foreign ID and asked for my passport (it had been accepted everywhere before). And said that it was not even ID as if I was lying. So my boyfriend went all the way home to get my passport.  While waiting I had to ask the waitress for  water 2!!! times before she brought it. And then when my bf returned we got sushi but there was no soy sauce, so we had to get it ourselves.  When the main dish was served we had to ask 2 times again for utensils.  By that time the food was cold."}
{"text":"Ate here twice and never again. Not only does the food taste bad but they have also lost our credit card. We have to sat there for an hour so they could try to find our credit card."}
{"text":"Had a reservation for four last night.  Sat outside and had to find a server to wait on us after 15 minutes (two or three hostesses sat us outside but then forgot about us?).  This happened again after they brought our waters.    We ordered the drinks and one of the beers ordered came out wrong (IPA vs Red).  No excuses other than sorry/no credit given.  Appetizers were ok but the entrees weren't really warm (broccoli was way overcooked).  Ordered a 2nd wine and it took until the end of my meal to get there.  Total bill was $180 w/tip.  Have been disappointed here before as well.  Will think again before going next time."}
{"text":"Awesome service! I've been going there for a long time and have nothing but good things to say about those that work there. Friendly, accommodating, and they genuinely care about their guests. Jose had me laughing in tears. It just might be the new place in the district to go to especially after the menu and management has changed. I would definitely set it as a priority to those going to the district."}
{"text":"My time here was horrid, i had a very rude waiter where i felt as though i couldnt even crack a smile without being judged.  first he scolded  me for playing a simple sugar game at the table, then  proceeded  to slam my cup on the table. I felt very judged and felt like i was in school being lectured  and couldnt laugh. He seemed to be nice to everyone but my friend and i. Although the food was decent, id give 5 stars to dat ass doe."}
{"text":"I've been here several times.  The food is tasty, and the decor is very different than any restaurant I've been to.  It looked like something that Humphrey Bogart would be at.  With all that said, it doesn't counteract the absolutely HUGE prices that will attack you when the bill comes.  With prices this expensive, I could live the rest of my life never having to go to the Elephant Bar again, and I wouldn't miss it at all.  Save your cash."}
{"text":"When I pay more for food I'm expecting it to be made fresh. I asked if I could have light rice in my sushi roll and the waitress informed my that they were pre made."}
{"text":"Service was super slow and the food was terribly disappointing. The chicken and shrimp wok-fired dish read well on the menu but was a huge disappointment when it arrived to the table. The chicken was burnt, dry and super salty. The shrimp were over cooked and dry. The vegetables, well, they didn't look like veggies. Overcooked, over seasoned. This place is not worth the effort, keep driving and find some where else to dine."}
{"text":"Loved this place until they changed the menu.  I will only return if spicy edemame,  lobster, chicken teriaki,  and tri tip are put back on the menu.  Right now there menu went from being exotic and bursting with flavor to a 2 and food comparable to as fast food place. In other words don't take off the most flavorful and popular items on the menu! !!!! Helllooooooooooo"}
{"text":"My husband is on a strict diet due to some health issues. The manager/chef, Cody Edwards, went above and beyond explaining how he could modify the dish my husband was asking about to fit our needs. They were great!"}
{"text":"Maybe I just don't get this place, I don't know.  I mean, the decor is nice enough, and fairly unique, bar drinks are served in cutesy glasses, but the kitchen is loud and distracting.    As far as the selection, I think they go out of their way to come up with unique combinations.  Some of these work and some don't.  The sweet potato fries were good, and my salad was the best part of the meal.  Entrees left something to be desired - not a lot of flavor going on here.  My advice to the diner would be keep it simple.  The fire grilled salmon was really good.  A couple of the items from the wok kitchen - Mongolian Beef and Chicken Stir Fry - not so good, oily and very salty.  To the establishment I would say, pick a cuisine (the grilled selections) and go with it."}
{"text":"While I didn't get the chance to eat there, the management was 5 Stars. The manager was able to come outside, and provide jumper cables for my rental car. I unfortunately had to head back to the airport, so I couldn't return the favor and order food/drinks. Go to this restaurant, leave big tips and give the manager a raise!"}
{"text":"This place is the disgrace of the district, the food is awful and the service mediocre. I ordered the rib eye sliders, which I've had before, and while they've never been amazing, usually they're palatable, tonight they tasted rancid and I only ate a few bites before deciding the French fries were probably the safer bet. My husband ordered street tacos that were so soggy that they looked like they had been served in cheap paper towels, and the medium rare steak my son ordered was cooked to medium well perfection served with instant mashed potatoes & rubbery frozen veggies. This place used to be decent and we were regulars, but it has gone significantly downhill over the last few visits. Tonight was definitely our last visit here. Especially since the previously described meal with a coke and 2 beers was over $70. I would rather have eaten McDonalds. Pick ANY other restaurant in the district, even Balboas."}
{"text":"We eat here a lot and almost always have a great experience. The prices here are very reasonable for the amount and quality of food you get. There is a very cute and comfortable atmosphere and the service is always excellent.   We really enjoy the salmon, mahi mahi, and jambalaya especially. Just a tip: they are really good about substituting side dishes if you don't like what comes with the meal.   If you haven't been here before, you should give it a try!"}
{"text":"Eh, okay but not great.  Humongous menu and food seemed pretty hit and miss.  My lamb was not very good (I lost my appetite about half way through) but the chicken teriyaki someone else ordered was okay (don't worry, that someone else was at my table, I didn't pick off the next table's leftovers, though I was tempted).  It just seemed like a cheesecake factory ripoff, huge menu catering to everyone but not as good food."}
{"text":"Eating here always a pleasure. Tasty food, courteous Staff and the service spot on! The Parmesan Crusted Green Beans are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal tonight.  Food was prepared really well.  Server Amanda Arauz was wonderful -attentive, friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  I that the pistachio crusted cod with Asian slaw.... Very good.  Good price and had a great time.  My mother had the pub burger made of prime rib meat.  Would recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"Retirees' nite out?  wow I have never seen such a huge concentration of over 65 group in 1 place!  This place was packed & IT WAS REALLY LOUD IN THERE!  Luckily got a booth in the bar and we did actually get pretty \"ok\" service.  Food was pretty good.  I was a bit miffed my wine came in a glass as opposed to the regular way of them pouring it in a crafe and gving you that along with you glass, so I got a bit gypped there.    Was a good option to go to before heading over to the Skye Theatre."}
{"text":"4 visits.  GR8 place to hit before or after a movie @ Harkins.  Happy Hour is full of values.  I especially like that premium wines are discounted and the pours are huge -  You get a third of a bottle  = 2 big glasses.  (Oh, I am big on quality glasses, and they actually serve really nice, uniquely shaped crystal stemware - bonus points there - I mean that's where the the 5th star comes in).   Chicken lettuce wraps are yummy (ie: no guilt here!).  Keep that bruschetta coming!  OK, have to admit, the sweet potato fries are really, really good.  Last night, just before going to the screening of Knight & Day,  everything arrived within minutes of ordering: from the appetizers, to meals, to entrée-to-go and every drink. (insert a \"Todd-High-5\" here)"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday and was deathly sick. Do not eat the Salmon sushi roll. Food poisoning is not fun!! I have been sick ever since and still fighting the bacteria in my body from what I ate here. Restaurants  should take food poisoning very seriously and monitor their food daily. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"My friends and I were in town to do some late night shopping at IKEA and wanted to find somewhere to stop for food and drinks before the drive back to Tucson. We fumbled through Yelp for nearby places but nothing looked appealing.   Then we stumbled on the Elephant Bar just by driving by. I pulled up their Yelp page and the first review I saw commented on their decor, \"looks like Africa threw up inside\" and we instantly knew this was the place to go.  The review didn't lie; giraffe statues, zebra print....totally Africa style. Awesome interior. It was almost 10pm so no wait to get seated at a booth in the bar. Happy Hour started at 10 so we took a few minutes to look over the drink menu. Our waitress was very attentive and kept coming back to check on us and grab our food and drink orders. She was very knowledgeable and was able to recommend a bottle of wine to pair with my DELICIOUS steak and coconut shrimp. My friends ordered shrimp and the quick-seared tuna (maybe it was mahi-mahi?) which were equally pleasing to my tastebuds.  The only complaint I have is our waitress was less and less attentive as the night went on (and the drunker we got) but I couldn't blame her, it was a Saturday night. Overall this is definitely a place to check out and I will be back ASAP!"}
{"text":"Great place!  Comfy setting, low lights, nice and quiet so you can have a conversation, and the food and cocktails were fantastic. We could make this our regular place."}
{"text":"I gave this restaurant a bad review a while back - but after visiting a few more times I decided that I needed to rewrite my review. My last two visits have been very enjoyable - great service, great food at great prices. I guess the one visit where everything was awful a while back must have been a one time event. At any rate - I am a fan of the Elephant Bar once more after receiving excellent service and food. Great going Elephant Bar!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour from 3-7. Food is always high quality with large portions. The staff is always super friendly. One of my favorite regular spots."}
{"text":"I came here probably 5 years ago and believe to have gotten food poisoning from it. I told myself I wouldn't visit here again. However, I received a gift card at work and decided to give it a try again and possibly just get drinks. My boyfriend and I came in, in a hurry to get to a movie and had prompt service. Annie L was our server and she was fantastic she got our drinks quickly and suggested vegetable lettuce wraps since we are vegan. The food and drinks were great and her service was absolutely the best we have ever had. It was a pleasant surprise coming back."}
{"text":"The Elephant Bar has been one of our family favorites for many years. We come at least twice a month to enjoy the unique global menu and to try many of the new dishes. We have never been disappointed until last night. The service was still excellent but the menus have taken a completely different turn. #1, the boards that the menus are on are too big, heavy, and hard to handle, #2, the menu now shows that the restaurant has moved to mostly American type dishes (steaks, fries, the other usual fare that can be found in any other restaurant. # 3, the portions were very small and the food preparation was well below par. #4, many of the favorites are no longer on the menu and have been replaced by burger and fries (again, that type of food can be had anywhere). We were very disappointed by the experience and decided to write to see if this menu is a trial or is this the direction the restaurant is going? We would be saddened to see it lower its standards to try and be like everyone else. If this is the future then yesterday would be the last time we will visit the Elephant Bar. Thank you."}
{"text":"Confused by the amount of 3+ stars. Gave this place a chance and it did not meet my expectations. Service was awful. Food was terrible. I got the spaghetti and didn't think you could go wrong with that but evidently you can. Friends got Mac and cheese and have never tasted anything more oily and bland.   3 stars for the appearance and ribs."}
{"text":"Good food! Our waitress Danielle was awesome! I would come back. I little noisy but not overbearing."}
{"text":"This place almost sucks. I have never been impressed with the food. It gets really  crowded during happy hour due to food and drink specials. If not for the happy hour, which is not really that good of a deal, I expect this place to be empty and out of business soon. Elephant bar and restaurant is not for me."}
{"text":"They have excellent service here and are very accommodating. Our little kids shared a kids meal, which came with a dessert and they offered the give them each their own dessert after their meal. We also dropped our left over tacos on the ground that we were planning on bringing and they also offered to make new ones to take home. In addition, the food was excellent and would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This place on the weekend is packed, I felt like a sardine stuffed into a small can! Our waiter seemed over worked. I received my order of orange chicken, but it tuned out to be a beef dish. I had to send it back. After the long wait for the food, it really wasn't a great meal. The rice was warm at best, although the chicken was flavorful. After speaking with the manager and informing him about my un-satisfaction, he comped my meal,this was the saving grace. So this is why they received 3 stars, the manager saved the night and a possible future customer. I am not sure if i will go there again, there are other places that i have really enjoyed."}
{"text":"We tried them again this last Sat night 01/25/2014. If you like a slight better service than Denny's, this is the place. we too tried the 2 for $20.00 coupon. Over cooked and undersized portions. We ask for some bread to go with the meal. That's an extra charge of $3.00. It was actually a roll sliced 4 ways, cold and cold hard butter to go with it. They rush the tables and want to clear plates before your finished and for some reason, (parting of rushing) bring your entree before your done with your appetizer.  I would suggest to the staff to get your resumes ready, Elephant Bar Chandler will close itself very soon."}
{"text":"Yummy.  The trout was fantastic, the cosmo's were outstanding and the spinach/artichoke dip was also really awesome.  Our waiter was very attentive and we had a lovely evening.  The food was excellent, the staff was friendly and the prices were reasonable.  We will definately visit here again the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"The food was decent. The place was too cold, my steak got cold and hard before I could even get half way through it. The mash potatoes were lacking flavor. The only reason I want to go back is to try their drinks and desserts."}
{"text":"Horribly dry chicken and fish.  We'll never return.  I'd give zero stars if I could.  Service lacking as well."}
{"text":"Had a cobb salad. It was big and delicious. Huge fan.  Liquor prices were decent as well. Bit higher than I'd like for some things, but a lot lower than usual for others."}
{"text":"We love going to the Bar for their happy hour.  food is great  drinks are affordable  and all the servers are very nice especially Christina shez da bomb. Most of the bad reviews seem like they are from the restaurant side. their non happy hr time is only from 7-9 small window. get the happy hr burger , buffalo wings, or samon roll , mm mm"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place in the last several months but it has really gone downhill. I came in with family tonight and ordered salads. It took over 30 minutes for food. Some lettuce and garnish shouldn't take 30 minutes. When the food did arrive most of the party was disappointed. I ordered some French onion soup and I had to take the bread out of the soup and cut it. Soup with a knife and  fork??? Ridiculous.. Not sure what's going on but this used to be my go to place but I think I'll need to look elsewhere. Sad :("}
{"text":"I give them three stars because it was good but my mash potato's were cold and one of my friends steak was not we'll done it was totally the opposite but over all that they were d"}
{"text":"Went here before a movie on Thursday night. Not very busy in the restaurant. Had a couple drinks and shared appetizers. Ordered off the bar/happy hour menu. We haven't been here in a while and I thought happy hour ends at 7 PM but I guess recently they change that. Bummer! Happy hour now ends at 6 PM and the menu has changed slightly but still pretty good. Appetizers and drinks were very good.   On Mondays Mai tai's are half off. Will be coming in for that. If management is reading this my only suggestion is happy hour should end at 7 PM ---- 6 PM is way too early for this area"}
{"text":"The atmosphere doesn't match the name. It's not a bar. It's a family restaurant with a bar inside. I went for the restaurant side, so I didn't much care for the bar anywho.  As a global/wok kitchen, I already expected it to be less than good. A good restaurant, in my experience generally specializes in a style of cuisine, with the few great exceptions like Momofukos in New York. The elephant bar has a wide, imaginative menu, but the flavors are lacking. The menu sounds tasty, but doesn't live up to its description. I thought, after trying a few different meals, \"I'll try a basic dish... Macaroni and cheese.\"  They blew it. The texture of the cheese resembled that of evaporated milk. There's a better way to mix three cheeses, and its called cream. I won't be going back, unless its to try the bar."}
{"text":"Elephant Bar has been around for years and this was my first time to go to one. The Mahi Mahi with Macadamia wasn't bad. However, the sides weren't that great (rice and veggies) and didn't have much or any seasoning. Our server and other employees asked us at least 15 times if everything was OK, which was a bit annoying. I mean it's great for them to check on you than not checking at all. But after a certain point, it gets to be too much. I wondered if this was a way to get us to order more or for us to leave."}
{"text":"Things started out well. They messed up may steak and took forever to get a new one. My party was done eating by the time my new steak came out. Other tables were getting served but again took revere to get the replacement steak. The food we did get was good.   I would not go back and probably go to one of the other restaurants near by."}
{"text":"I always have a great experience at Elephant Bar! The food and service are fantastic! Our server tonight, Kim, was extremely friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I can't believe this is considered \"Asian fusion\" in Phoenix. There is absolutely nothing Asian about this restaurant. It's a standard American restaurant offering salads, fries, grilled fish, mac and cheese, etc.  I ordered the citrus fruit salad with grilled chicken which ended up being a good dish. The salad was good (although it had too much dressing) but the chicken was too dry. The sweet potato fries were meh.  The service was extremely friendly, but then again I've experienced amazing service everywhere in the South, so I think it is a bit of a southern thing.  I can't compare this to other restaurants in Phoenix as it was one of the only ones I went to. But in my book it's definitely one of those \"eat to live\" places, and not worth a second trip."}
{"text":"Please! Please stop changing the menu so soooo many times why fix something if it ain't broken. I've been a customer of yours for 14 years but you change the menu way too many times and remove all the signature dishes such as macadamia salmon and chicken fettuccine. I wish you would go back to the original menu where quality also mattered!   ."}
{"text":"I've been to various Elephant Bar locations over the past ten or so years since I have moved to the Valley. Initially, I had very positive experiences there. Lately, however, it's been sliding in the opposite direction. This time I had one of their specials- grilled pork. Honestly, I can grill the pork better than their chef did. It was dry and overcooked; only the sauce made it at all edible. The mashed potatoes and vegetables were fine, I suppose, but hardly high caliber. My partner had something with shrimp in it, and he commented that they tasted \"off\".   Considering the cost of the meal, I really expected better. The only saving grace of the entire experience was that we had an excellent server. The best service in the world won't convince me to eat here again, though. Very disappointing. I recommend the Cheesecake Factory nearby if you're looking for good food (with huge portions) in the same price range."}
{"text":"This place is super awesome, we went on for valentines day dinner. Wait time was not that bad. Food was pretty fast and delicious, our waitress was super attentive. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Ehhh not the best. Came here around lunch time in a Friday and the place was not busy. The moment we walked in the employees were standing around talking to each other we were completely ignored. One employee who seemed rather busy cleaning a table came to seat us, because the other employees didn't. The menu offered many options but everything seemed the same. I finally settled for a basic burger. After receiving our food our waiter was no where to be seen. It took awhile to finally get the attention of another employee to switch out the high chair because the one I had for my daughter had a broken buckle. For a place that did not have many customers the noise level was loud not because if people talking but the annoying background music I couldn't even have a conversation with my friend. After finishing our meals an employee came up immediately to clean the table but we were still waiting on a check. Not sure I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Terrible food.  The descriptions of the entrees far outstrip the actual food.  Mine  - the Crispy Teriyaka Chicken was bland, only sort of warm and the rice was barely warm and was dry and tasteless. The chicken was dry and unbelievably tough.  It all tasted like it had been on the warmer for hours.  My friend's meal was equally bland, but since it was a salad, at least temp was not an issue.  It was not busy when we arrived, but the hostess acted as if it was problem to serve us. We stood in front of her and all she could do was stare blankly at us.  So I informed her that we would like to have dinner, as if two people standing at the hostess station were a complete mystery.  And the server was just terrible.  Her response to everything we ordered, was \"Not a problem!\" as if bringing us the food and drink on the menu could in some way be a problem.  Perhaps she should look up the word \"Server.\" Stunning that employees could be so poorly trained and inept. Never again will I step foot in Elephant Bar."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Elephant Bar and I found this location to be just as nice as the others. I ordered the pad thai and requested it to be extra spicy. My bf got the jalapeno burger. Both were really good! And our server was very helpful."}
{"text":"Ment family here to visit while passing through. Very friendly staff, good service. A few unique menu items, but menu overall is a different mix of offerings. Something for every taste"}
{"text":"They have the best salad ever! The name is Thai-High Sweet & Zesty Chicken Salad. It is seriously the best salad I've ever eaten. I crave it daily! And it's huge so if you go there for lunch you can easily split it. They also have a good kids menu and a nice atmosphere. But really, don't miss out on that salad!"}
{"text":"An unfortunate experience.     I visited this location on a slow Saturday afternoon, and decided to dine at the bar since I was alone.  The attending bartender was alone in the area, and only one other table of two people was in the area; they had arrived before me and had already ordered their food by the time I arrived.  I seated myself at the bar and the busy bartender announced \"I'll be with you\", as she raced about.  A few minutes later she returned with three menus and announced \"here's all the menus.  you want me to get you a drink while you're looking at them?\"   I responded \"I'm here on business.  I cant drink.\"  She disappeared.  A few minutes later, she returned and asked if I'd had any questions about the menu.  I asked a question, she answered, then began walking away.  As she was hurriedly leaving, I stopped her and announced that I was ready to order.  She took my order, printed the bill, and left it in front of me.  Odd.  I can't recall ever getting my restaurant bill BEFORE getting my food.  The hurried and distracted \"service\" continued through the meal.  I would most accurately describe the service as curt--a standard I'm not used to, living in Orlando, FL , a resort city with a rival number of dining experiences as  the greater Las Vegas area.    After my meal, I was asked if I wanted any other food.  I declined, feeling I had been unwelcomed during my stay.  I declined the offer, sharing that she had prematurely printed my invoice and had discouraged me from ordering more by doing so.  She unapologetically responded \"that's standard practice\"  I shared that it discouraged people from ordering more when you did that.  She replied \"I haven't had any problems with it\".   I was definitely taken aback by her unapologetic demeanor.   I pondered this response, as I noticed her provide a check to the table of two when they announced they were ready for the check a few moments earlier.  Overall, while the food lived up to my expectations, the service fell far short of what I've ever had at any restaurant--even other Elephant Bar locations I've visited.   Alone.  At an otherwise empty bar.  On a low traffic day.   My experience was disappointing."}
{"text":"Great food but service was a bit slow 2nd time we went. (And it wasn't busy.) Decor was African bush themed, upscale & interesting. Unfortunately the BBQ pulled pork sandwich was taken off the menu... During my first visit in ordered this with house coleslaw (which was the BEST I've ever had anywhere) & wanted it again. Wish chef would have made it upon request, but he didn't. This visit I ordered the chicken breast sandwich with Fry's & their amazing coleslaw; which was tasty. My mom ordered a cheeseburger that she enjoyed. Was nothing special about it but tasty nonetheless. I'd definitely come back for the slaw if nothing else. It's worth a look see & enjoy! Bon Apatite'."}
{"text":"Has been my family's quick goto spot for dinner. We started off in Cali but moved to Arizona and started going to the one there. Now, we live in Las Vegas and naturally visit this location! Always great food and service!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a eat. A little pricey but was great to share with my husband for Date night ! We did the 16oz Ribeye and it was amazing , was really good and just enough to share for both of us ! Very yummy and drinks are really good ! I would recommend!"}
{"text":"What a neat place. We had a lovely girl who was our server, sorry to say i don't remember her name. But, she was great!                                         The menu here is very extensive.   It was hard to know what to choose there was so much. I got the seared Ahi salad and my date got the schewan beef with rice. Both items were really good.   Restaurant was very clean as well as the bathrooms. The place had a great decor as well!  I thought it was a lot of fun and well done. We even sat outside for a little bit after dinner on the front patio. It was really clean (a good thing  since we have had all the dust storms).  Music was playing lighting ,not overwhelming. I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Elephant bar sends out these coupons for 2 entries and 1 shared appetizer. So, I thought what they hey, were going to be in green valley...might as well try it!   It's okay, it has some pluses and some minuses. But overall, probably wouldn't come back.   Pluses: really cool decorations, it's got the african safari look going on, and it looks beautiful  minues: the food is not that great. we got the korean ribs and chicken breast and chicken thai dinner. both were ok. I mean, they didn't taste bad...but they weren't really good either. I felt like i was eating it because i need a filler for my stomach, but I never craved the next bite...which isn't what you want to be feeling when your out to eat.   Also, our waiter had THE WORST TIMING. And kept doing it. It's like she was trying to rush us out of there even though the restaurant was 70% empty. For example, my husband and I are in the middle of our dinner prayer, and she comes up, asked if were ready to order, and stands there...no excuse me no apology...kind of rude. Then as were eating out dinner, food still out our plates, she asked if were done with our food and if we want a box? Um what?--No i want to eat my food--go away."}
{"text":"Very good service. I can't believe they have amazing lunch specials 7 days a week starting at $5.50. Yum.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you like Cheese Cake Factory but can't stand that it's always packed and that they have advertisements in their menu then Elephant bar is the place for you! We visit this place all the time and then go see a movie next door at the casino. Food has somewhat of an asian theme to it but the menu rotates frequently and has \"limited time specials\" which are quite good. Happy hour is very good and so is the food. The bartenders are awesome, lookin at you Roy! Staff remembers us whether at the bar for drinks or the dining area for a full meal. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! The food is always delicious and the service is great!! I never have to wait longer than 10 minutes for a table."}
{"text":"Amazing service Nicole! Two thumbs up!  My daughter and I enjoyed dinner. Your recommendations are superb!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Really good service and surprisingly affordable.  We sampled a few different appetizers and they were all good. I ordered a grilled chicken, tri tip, veggies and mashed potato plate and it was all cooked perfectly with some very unique flavors.  They have a wonderful in house barbecue sauce.  Two thumbs up, 5 stars and go eat here! It's Applebee's pricing with way better food and a much better environment. (It's a modern safari theming that's done quite well)"}
{"text":"Great food.   My husband ordered the jambalaya and I ordered the pear  gorgonzola burger.  Would recommend both.  Danielle gave us amazing service. Very friendly and attentive"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour with a friend...first time for me, second for her. Happy hour runs from 3-7pm. We had house margaritas ($3)--yum! Normal margarita, didn't taste like they had watered them down for cheaper prices. Food-wise we had the sweet potato fries, buffalo chicken tenders, mozzarella w/bruschetta, spring rolls, and the salmon tempura. All of it was really good. We weren't huge fans of the spring rolls, but the salad underneath them was great! Dressing was light but had great flavors. Ranged in price from $3.50-$6.50. Overall, we spent about $45--which gave us both a buzz and full bellies! We never even looked at the full menu.  Our server (who, I can't remember his name, sorry!) was super nice and on top of things. Not sure if he was impressed with how much food we packed away... Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Walked into the bar area with my girlfriend just to try it out.  The food itself was okay.  We got there during happy hour so the price was pretty good.  The service was good.  I'd definitely come here again"}
{"text":"Horrible service on the patio on a Friday night with barely anyone at the entire establishment! Would not recommend. It took over two hours to get two rounds of drinks and appetizers. Never got water. Took another 20 minutes for our bill to be delivered after asking for it and then another 20 minutes for them to come to get payment. Don't waste your time mediocre food, decent drinks, and horrible service!"}
{"text":"Don't go on a busy night,  unless you like to pay $25 for overdone steak, undercooked (raw, lumpy)mashed potatoes and an overcooked (microwaved) lobster tail that was about 3 inches in length.  Green beans looked good but were cold and stringy.  Husband ordered salmon (which was good) but rice was chewy and undercooked.  We both had margaritas, which were served in highball glasses and tasted like a shot of tequila over ice!  Service was slow.  Never again on New Years Eve at 6:30!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a restaurant near Chandler Fashion when I came across Elephant Bar and Grill.  The reviews on here were mixed but I decided to take the chance. The host was friendly and welcoming.  I was quickly sat and my server, Merissa came shortly to welcome and take my drink order, which was just what I needed.  I was pleased with her drink recommendation, which was a Long Island Iced Tea.  I didn't plan on drinking, but it really hit the spot.  Throughout my experience, she was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. I can see myself becoming a regular here.  Not only will I be requesting Merissa for my next visit, I am excited to try her other recommendations and have a new Happy Hour spot to bring friends!"}
{"text":"This place far exceeded our expectations! At first we were weary because of some of the reviews, but everything was perfect from start to finish and our server Joe was running circles around the restaurant. He had our drinks filled constantly and gave great service. I got the sirloin steak (so tender+juicy) and my boyfriend got the ribeye steak. We loved everything, and we're kind of shocked- I can honestly say it's one of the best steaks I've had at a spot like this one. Potato skins were good too!"}
{"text":"I am usually not a fan of chain restaurants, even small chains, but I've been going to Elephant Bar on and off for years and it's always been tasty and consistent, if nothing extraordinary food-wise. The reason behing the 5 stars is that my small non-profit had been looking for a party location (25 people) for a while, and not one restaurant in The District offered us a decent deal (some wanted $1500 to rent the patio for a few hours). However, Kevin at Elephant Bar really hooked up up, met with me and the organization's president, and went out of his way to make our event a great one. No charge to use the patio (just for us) on a Thursday night, we got 2 dedicated servers, and he even extended happy hour for us! He also allowed us to bring in a cake and decorations and even printed a special menu for us with the apps we had chosen. All in all, it was a fantastic experience and my little non-profit is very grateful. We ended up spending roughly $600 and all our out-of-town guests were delighted. They liked the food, the service, the good drink selection and the patio.   Thank you so much for a job well done and for supporting small non-profits."}
{"text":"Excellent Place for anyday casual dine out or the bar.  Lively atmosphere, excellent service and Die for menu!  I love their openers- there is a huge variety to choose from. Great chef's specials and very nice cock tails! We had some fun cocktails with mango flavor, black cherry mojito and martinis. They have great lunch specials as well. Menu has everything from wok, sandwiches, burgers to shrimp/veg pad thai or fried mahi mahi. Good options available for vegetarians as well ( I liked their garden burger)"}
{"text":"Very large menu, but poor service. Waiters have far too many tables at peak times leaving the guest unattended and forgotten about. We were just a party of 4 and it was not a good visit.  Others around us had similar problems. There are far too many restaurants in Scottsdale area, avoid the headache and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Maria Luisa, our bartender Monday 6.26.17, fantastic!  We asked for Joel Gott, Merlot by the glass.. she opens a new bottle... wow!  Excellent service right off the bat after her warm welcome.    JJ, the manager, was off for a wine & vodka seller in the back, but he still took the time out to chat w/ us about our experience.  We ordered the $4 HH Mac 'N Cheese which was believably good!  I can't say more than that it would taste like your grandmothers lol to die for!  The service today w/ Maria, JJ & as we were walking out, Jamie, all smiling faces & very helpful made me raise my three star to a solid five star.  Drastic move in only a few days, but we were impressed.  I am not always sure if people in the restaurants are reading my reviews & I feel they took it to heart w/ a good attitude & that makes the difference.  Making reasonable changes to make customers happy seems easy & successful & I am thankful to walk back in & can't wait until next time.  I need to learn the Chef's names as well because they never fail & deserve credit so THANK YOU CHEF'S!"}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday for a late lunch and a drink - had not been here before. Was glad to see that they had happy hour specials going on, so ordered the chicken lettuce wraps off the HH menu. Bartender was friendly and accommodating and order came out quickly. However, it had NO TASTE WHATSOEVER. Tried to spice it up a little with the bland peanut sauce and hoped the mango salad would enliven it, as well, but it was not to be. Glad I had a magazine with me, b/c there was no one to chat with at the bar...and tables seemed to be filled with the geriatric crowd. If I had any grandparents left, this is where I would take them."}
{"text":"It was our first time here. Service was great, food was fantastic, atmosphere is relaxing. My hubby and I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I read all the reviews and didn't think I would try this place out but my dad wanted to go so we went.  Our service was impeccable (thanks Nicole!!) and the food was very good.  We had the korean tacos and the calamari and I have to say that the calamari was some of the best I've ever had.....tender and delicious. Lamb Shanks, chicken and shrimp, shrimp three ways and mongolian beef were all excellent. Give it a shot and see how it goes....we got lucky I guess and had a great experience."}
{"text":"I will have to pass!    After many good reviews from friends and other individuals my fiancee and I went here for dinner. The service was incredibly slow (it wasn't a busy night), and the food was nothing to rave about. I got the ribs and it was tough and chewy.   Edit 1/21/2012:  In response to Joanna's comment I thought I'd post my e-mail response to her in further detail of my experience.  I figured the further detail might be helpful to other yelpers as well!   \"The food was adequate I had the ribs, which seemed rather tough and chewy.   Typically I am most forgiving when it comes to food and would be happy to return to try another entree; just because I might not enjoy one meal, doesn't meant I can't enjoy another. However, the deal breaker would have to be the service at the restaurant.  The wait staff took way to long of time to come back (after we requested a moment to look over the menu), we had someone else who worked there passing by to get our waitress.  The wait on our food after our order was a bit long, roughly more than 25-30 minutes and our waitress never came back to refill our drinks or checked back on us after we asked for our refill.  When we got our bill our waitress took too long.  In fact, my fiancee got up from our table to find anyone to help us pay for the bill. \""}
{"text":"usually i get the spaghetti and it's fabulous. the bread is good. but this time.. holy fuck the bread. was literally heaven in bread form. idk what you guys did this time. but lord have mercy i wanted to marry it. it was amazingggg. i would honestly order a plate of bread now. you dont even know. but yeah this is my favorite restaurant. keep up the amazing food i love you guyssss."}
{"text":"First time here and was surprised by how great the food was! Danielle was really awesome and very helpful! would recommend going here again & asking for her!"}
{"text":"A fun, relaxing dining experience.  Great presentation of food and beverage.  Kids portions were huge (they could save food cost and cut back) kids 10 and 12 couldn't finish. Lamb Chops and Steak were cooked perfect. Good flavor on everything.  Fingerling potatoes were a bit al dente but they were super fast to recognize and replace.  Our server, Edgar,  was awesome. Thank you for making our night special."}
{"text":"I am giving this place four delicious stars!  As we were sitting in the restaurant I was on yelp reading the reviews peeps have written on this place.  I think some of were smoking crack when you wrote your review.   This place is NOTHING like Chilis! The menu is large but it has a fabulous selection of items to choose from.  I started off with the coconut shrimp skewers and a artichoke dip.  Both were wonderful!   For dinner I ordered the Micau   Shrimp soup and salad. It was fabulous!  if you ask for more broth, less egg noodles it is a very healthy low calorie dish that is full of steamed veggies!    My husband ordered a steak and our kiddos had ribs. They loved their food as well.   For dessert we ordered their in house made Creme brûlée, but I guess it is very popular and they had sold out by 8pm.  Double sad face. :( :( ..  So we ordered the ice cream cake with Oreo crust. It was very good.  The kids had ice cream sundaes that came with their meals.   I think this place is very nice.  Our waiter, Tim, was very attentive even though the place was packed!   It was still very busy when we arrived at 8pm. We waited about 20 to sit .  The atmosphere is very lively and fun.   Yes, the kitchen is loud and sorta out in the open, but that is part of the fun.  I enjoyed it very much and we will go back soon.  If you haven't gone I suggest you give it a whirl!"}
{"text":"It has been quite a while since my nana has ever mentioned the Elephant Bar. She swore off the place after they discontinued her favorite dish. But while asking where we should celebrate our birthdays, she said she'd give it another try. My first impression was that it reminded me of the Rainforest Café which held a special place in my heart due to some very fond memories but the menu was far more diverse than anything at that iconic location. I had the Philly Cheese Steak with Caesar salad and it was to die for! The French roll was cooked to perfection and the balance of meat, cheese, and peppers was superb. Trina, our waitress, was amazing. It wouldn't have been quite the same experience without her dazzling personality and impeccable service. We are very happy customers and will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"After a terrible visit to the Elephant Bar in Emeryville, CA, I decided to give it the college try and visit again in Chandler, AZ.   I should've followed my first thought and went somewhere else. While I will say that I love their happy hour drink specials, the food leaves much to be desired. I ordered the salmon rolls, which was disappointing. The roll was 92 percent rice, 5 percent veggie and 3 percent salmon.   The only upside was the waiter at the bar provided good service. I will never return again. The Elephant Bar is a waste of money and space."}
{"text":"Wow don't know what happened to this place but the place was dead at 6pm. Got seated right away. Waiter took awhile to get to our table. We ordered right away but it took forever to get our food.  We have eaten here several times in the past and the quality of service and food seemed to have declined. It seems to be pricey too. Tortilla soup was good everything else was just ok. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Yummy....  after a nice day of shopping at the district. Very Bery yummy"}
{"text":"Service was good but food was mediocre.  Went in expecting to use a coupon, which limited what we could order, but having never come in we figured it would be alright. Ended up ditching that idea to order what we wanted. I tried the Tri-tip, fiancé ordered a build-your-own burger and got a salmon filet.  My meat was a little over-cooked, but tasty. Potatoes were very yummy, but the veggies, in all seriousness, were sad. Fiancé's burger was a slightly dry, however, it had really good flavor. I was thrown off by the depressing side of fries on his plate, though.  All in all, I wouldn't come back and order something with a veggie side, but the service was enough to make me reconsider a visit."}
{"text":"Im a cook so i get a little bit picky about the food but overall it was great, perfectly seasoned, many selections, didn't get to try dessert but the drinks were great! The mai tai was so delicious definitely will come again."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food, great service. I really don't know about the negative reviews. Been going there for about 4 years, and never had a negative experience with food or service. Also, Jeremiah and Mikki are awesome :-)"}
{"text":"The salmon roll pictured is good if it is not deep fried and smothered with sauce. Who the heck deep frys sushi anyway?  Moving on.... The burger (says the wife and uncle) is outstanding. It is like $5.50 with fries on happy hour. I will be getting that the next time.  I got the buffalo chicken fingers. I could not finish them all. They were huge and think there were like 5 or 6 of them. The sauce was a bit extreme. My ass was cursing me out the following day for that decision.  All in all, a very decent happy hour and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had an awesome anniversary dinner the other night service was great everything was nice and clean and the food was awesome Our waitresses name was Vanessa and she was absolutely fabulous.. We're new to Henderson so this is our first time  going out to eat and because the customer service was so good we will definitely visit elephant bar again"}
{"text":"I went to this place once or twice before years ago and was not too impressed with it. They seemed to be all over the place with their menu and nothing I had was all that good. I went back last night with my girlfriend who comes here a lot and I have to say they have fixed it. A little. The menu is still all over the place but not quite as bad as before. The food is a lot better than I remember. Kind of. My girlfriend ordered the Jambalaya and I was allowed to try a bite. It was really good. Great flavor. I was a little jealous. I ordered the \"Philly\" Cheesesteak sandwich. There is a reason I put quotes around Philly because to call this a Philly Cheesesteak insults Philly Cheesesteaks. Someone from Philadelphia would punch you for calling it that. It was good but no where near a real cheesesteak. The steak was good and there were peppers, mushrooms and cheese on it but that does not make it a cheesesteak. Definitely not a Philly Cheesesteak. Now I was told we needed to order a Crème Brulee for dessert and never a truer statement has been made. It was so good. I don't care if that was made 20 miles away and driven here and they thawed it out. That was good. I'm sure if you go to France and have the real thing this will taste like a pile of something but we aren't in France and this Crème Brulee was really good. I will definitely be back but I will order something else. I guess you just have to be careful what you order. I'm told the orange chicken, honey shrimp and burgers are good and don't forget the Jambalaya. Just stay away from the \"cheesesteak\". The price was not bad at all and the service was good too."}
{"text":"I forgot how much I loved this place! It had been a couple years since I'd dined here. I've never had a complaint about anything I've ordered and the same went for yesterday's visit. They have some great speciality cocktails and I love the atmosphere. Our server Edgar was amazing and made the whole experience even better. He seems to really love what he does and interacts wonderfully with guests. He went above and beyond everything we expected. There's no way I'm waiting a couple years to go back again!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 0 for service and a 5 for food I would. Came here to enjoy some drinks and your bartender Danny not only blatantly talked rudely about other guests in front of those guests but drank on the job with her friends. I would never recommended going. I'm still in awe with what I just saw."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try this place for lunch. I was very surprised because just by the name alone I didn't know what to expect. I had the honey shrimp which was amazing! Well, I enjoy Panda Express's orange chicken and this is a few steps above that. The shrimps breading was tangy, sweet and crispy and you can have either brown or white rice on the side with veggies. I liked the place so much I took the family the next day. I was even more pleased with kids menu! My son had the mac n cheese with bacon and ham and chicken tenders which all come with dessert and a drink for around $5. They have a kids program for teacher's, coaches or volunteers to reward children with Honerary kids meal's certificates. The manager was extremely friendly and came out to discuss this with me. Then gave me a very generous stack for the kids! And just because our food came out a little late we received a free dessert. Wow, what a way to end my weekend."}
{"text":"I tried this place a couple years ago and now I remember why I hadn't come back since last night... The food sucks. Don't get me wrong I WANT to like the Elephant Bar. It's centrally located, has a friendly staff, great ambiance, huge menu with pictures and it's cheap. Last night I had the Quick-Fried Soy-Ginger Calamari and it was by far the worst Calamari I have ever had or will probably ever have. It was on top of this dressed salad which made it soggy before it even made it to the table. The texture was that of string cheese and over cooked chicken. The flavor was unflattering to the delicacy of calamari. Next up I had the Teriyaki Chicken which was an upgrade from the Calamari fiasco but, it still was not good. It tasted smoky and I was expecting a thicker and more traditionally sweet teriyaki sauce. My husband said the Three Cheese Macaroni was legit but it was oddly topped with store bought croutons, smh! So what I learned was... This place is just not for me."}
{"text":"We love the Elephant Bar! Every time I ask my daughter where she wants to eat, this is where we go. She orders the steak and Mac n cheese every time. Her favorite dish at her favorite restaurant! I crave the ahi salad, and my mom adores the street tacos.   Dusti is the best! I've had great experiences with the service in general, but Dusti goes above and beyond, every single time. She's our fave!   Delicious food, (and drinks!) and exceptional service. You can't go wrong!  Update: Dusti is no longer here, but now we love, love, Jamie! Ask for her!"}
{"text":"When we are in the mood for appetizers, we often think of the Elephant Bar.    A couple appetizers we like to order are the coconut shrimp and the shrimp & crab cakes, although I've had much better crab cakes but they're pretty good.  The tempura salmon roll is always a nice addition to our appetizer line-up as well.    The Elephant Bar has a nice variety and we always enjoy what we order.  Service is good and the food comes out of the kitchen quickly and is always served hot."}
{"text":"Awful, awful, awful!  My husband & I decided to try something new in The District for our one-year anniversary.  We decided on The Elephant Bar despite several friends telling us the food was terrible.  I usually don't write reviews unless the business is extraordinarily amazing or awful...this place is definitely classified as awful in my book.  My husband ordered a chicken/tri-tip combo plate, which didn't look anything like the picture.  The chicken was marinated in some sort of sauce that tasted like the smell of dirty feet; the tri-tip was not very good either.  I ordered the Misoyaki Salmon, which was very dry and the sauce was average.  The veggies were soaked in oil and appeared to be the frozen kind you throw in a saucepan.  My husband is not a very picky eater, but even he agreed he would never come back.  We should have trusted our instincts and celebrated at the places we know are good...Lucille's, Cheesecake Factory, GVR Cafe or even Al's Garage (bar food) put this place to shame.  Don't waste your time... And now I know why such a 'high class' place puts out so many coupons.  This place was also totally overpriced for the quality...my meal alone was $17+ and I only ate probably a third of it."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, but the menu is overwhelming. We had a party of 11, yet it took awhile to be seated. The place wasn't that busy. The manager didn't seem to be very active in taking care of business. I needed to take my medication, so I went to the bar for water, but the bartender wasn't even there. The place is in a great location, it should have been much busier."}
{"text":"Food and drinks here are on point. Good happy hour.  However I'm not fond of the bartender Angela who has serviced us. I've gone to this location several times with friends and we sit in the bar area, makes for faster and more casual service.  I'm hesitant to score this place a 4 just because of her demeanor. She acts like she is doing us a favor by servicing us. I like a bartender or waitress/waiter to be funny and crack jokes but she just comes off like she's annoyed with our presence. Just to point out we are not a roudy rambunctious bunch, last time we were with my husband's parents.  When Angela came to give us our checks she was eating something. I'm not well versed in restaurant health code but my personal opinion is that is unsanitary."}
{"text":"I wasn't really expecting this to be a clone of the Cheesecake Factory when I went with some out of town family, but it was very similar.  The menu is way too large and covers nearly every kind of food you can think of except only having about two Vegetarian options which is a bummer. The restaurant was extremely hot the night we went not sure if they were over compensating for the cold weather or what, but it was very uncomfortable.  My meal was a pretty poor interpretation of stir-fry with tofu I can't really recommend it as anything you should go out of your way for.  Even the fried green bean appetizer was just a greasy soggy disappointment. The frozen food ones from the grocery are better and cheaper. Everyone I was with thought it was okay, but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"When I used to live in Vegas (going to school), I would come here for lunch every now and then with some friends.  I remember ordering a BBQ chicken type of salad, which is what I ALWAYS ordered, because I liked it THAT much.  Coming back to Vegas to visit, I was really excited to eat here and have that salad again!  Unfortunately, it looks like they changed their entire menu and they no longer make that salad.  :(  This is probably why my rating is not higher than a 3.  I ordered some mediterranean chopped salad instead.  It was fine, but just not what I was wanting.  Don't know if I'd drive to Green Valley just to eat here anymore. :("}
{"text":"If I could give them more than 5 stars I would! Their food and service never disappoint!   My husband and I went on a date night to the Elephant Bar tonight and our waitress, Michelle,  was by far amazing! Though they changed their menu, she gave a few suggestions on some new dishes and drinks they had to offer. Wow! I'm so glad we listened to her and tried some of her favorites. Delish! They may not have some of their older dishes/drinks on the menu, but they still offer them which made our hearts happy!"}
{"text":"The food is great at this restaurant but every time I have been there the service is awful. I have always gone in a large group and the waiters have gotten upset and disrupted conversations when we did have our orders ready when they wanted them (even though the restaurant was not busy). Once I saw our waiter stomp to a cash register and have a mini temper tantrum before returning to pestering us for our orders."}
{"text":"We came to celebrate a birthday. Jamie was our server and she was quite attentive.  However,  due to an unforeseen situation, we had to wait for our ginger spritzers. Also, my spouse ordered the pot roast which was lukewarm.  I am not certain if we will return."}
{"text":"My wife's friend wanted to celebrate her birthday at Elephant Bar Restaurant.  This was our first time here.  Location and atmosphere.. The web page does not mention the Anthem address.  It was difficult to find.  By the way, it is NOT in the Green Valley Casino.  It is actually 2 blocks down in a mall call the DISTRICT.  Next to the District is a cinema.  Parking is about 150 yards or so away.  I wish it was better lit.  The restaurant is pretty nice (a bit noisy).  It has some type of African theme.  I give this a 3.5 stars.  Service -- our waittress was pretty nice and busy.  We had 3-4 people waiting on us (water, food, etc...).  Food -- well, the menu is kinda all over the place... surf and turf and asian fusion.  This kinda sprung a red light.  Sometimes, when a restaurant has too much variety, it can lower the quality of food.  We ordered the Grand Sampler.  It was pretty good.  The coconut shrimp was tasty hot, chicken fingers were okay, and the spinach dip was actually pretty good.  I ordered the Kono combo - ribs, chicken, and skewered shrimp.  The ribs were tender and very good, shrimp was a bit over cooked (being a seafood lover, first time that I could not eat or finish all the shrimp), and the chicken was awful -- it was dried and rubbery.  I bet the chicken was NUKED in the microwave.  I only took two bites too many from the chicken.  My wife had the Ahi Shashimi.  The shashimi was decent; however, the rice layers and veggies was not very good.  She did not touch that.   As for drinks, I had the Jungle Colada.  I think this was the best part of the meal.  Overall, I give the food a very LOW 3 or a high 2.    Overall, for 5 of us, 1 large appetizers, drinks, and 5 entrees, the bill ran to about $165 (excluding tips).  Because of the service and atmosphere, this gets a 3.  It could have been lower.  Note:  if you like this type of food (surf and turf), I think a better alternative would be a Red Lobster."}
{"text":"My family loves Elephant Bar. We go there at least once a month for happy hour, and their deals are fantastic. Good (stiff) drinks, great appetizers (though I wish they'd put the seared Ahi back on the happy hour menu). The service is fantastic.   If you go on a Friday night, get there early! It fills up quickly, but it's absolutely worth it, when you're paying between $4-7 for your drinks and appetizers. I've never been there for anything but happy hour, but this is our 'go-to' place."}
{"text":"Meh....I was not impressed with the food and won't be returning. Nice waitress, a little chatty and liked to linger at our table, but she tried really hard to answer all of our questions and make sure we got what we wanted. First issue was with my Cobb Salad.  They chop the iceberg lettuce into little pieces (maybe to hide the fact that the lettuce is old and wilted?). Not only did the lettuce taste like dirt, but upon closer inspection the lettuce looked overly brown; not very appetizing.  My husband had a French dip, but ran out of aus jus by the second half of his sandwich (the aus jus came in the smallest ramekin I have ever seen; maybe more of a condiment container).  He said the sandwich was edible, but rather bland. His sweet potato fries were pretty good. My son had a quesadilla, and I would have rather eaten that than my Cobb salad."}
{"text":"My nephew decided to take the family out for dinner and, of course, we decided to go to a busy restaurant during the dinner rush.  Our server, Eddie, appeared to be overwhelmed at first, a little rushed with his drink orders, then a little more patient but still stressed with dinner orders.  As I mentioned it was busy.  Everyone got their food, including me, but I got the wrong dish.  I ordered the Kona ribs with fries and got Kona ribs and chicken with brown rice instead.  (I do NOT like brown rice.) Eddie offered the menu back - I knew when he asked if I wanted white or brown rice, something was wrong, and I should've mentioned it.  Needless to say, I showed him what I ordered... He was awesome.  No argument, no rude remarks, just an explanation of the item.  I placed my order again and it was delicious!  So happy.  My mom, the kids, my brother and my nephew all enjoyed the night.  And because Eddie was so kind, he got that extra tip!    Dinner choices and overall thoughts (I tasted the ahi salad and got reviews around the table):  French onion soups, cheesy and delish Side green salad, side Caesar salad, typical, but good Seared Ahi tuna salad, delish though just a little salty for my taste Lamb shanks, tender and full of flavor, potatoes were smooth and very good, veggies were good enough to eat Kona pork ribs, sweet and tender, delish, coleslaw was a little wet for my taste so my daughter stole it, fries were hot and salty (the kind of salty I like), and the apple \"relish\" was really yummy.  The boys attacked. They were out of the Giant Cookie ice cream sandwich, so we were \"forced\" to order the strawberry shortcake.  Oh my gosh, we DEVOURED that thing.   https://scontent-b-dfw.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/l/t1.0-9/10394585_1620289958195386_7688075413347857986_n.jpg"}
{"text":"I usually love Happy hour at EB, but one bartender making drinks and serving a packed bar is a recipe for disaster.  It was 10 min before we saw the waitress and another 10 before we had menus and water. It was a good 15 min after that before we ordered.  Eventually I got a good sized garden salad (thank you for having fat free dressings), but it was just lettuce and a few croutons. I then had a delicious cup of mushroom soup (the best part of the meal) and the Ahi Tuna appetizer. I had wasabi, ginger and ponzu and an empty small dish that I can only assume was meant for soy sauce (which no one ever offered) along 5-6 various sized slices of tuna. It was good, but I wish I had some soy sauce.  The drinks were filled regularly and the bartender made it over once to check om us during the soup course, but I didn't see her again until she was offering dessert.  I've had better experiences and better food there (my husband loves the lamb shanks and I live the Cashew Chicken), but things seemed on the verge of collapsing today.  Next time I won't sit in the bar if I am im a hurry, but there are some really good happy hour food and drink options that I really like (sweet potato fries!).  Overall - a smidge above Meh."}
{"text":"Before this past Father's Day,  it had been at least 4-5 years since I've eaten here. Something told me I enjoyed it before so we went there with another family to celebrate \"my day\". Atmosphere was good, greeting from hostess was fair and the waitress was very friendly. Very eclectic and interesting menu. Trying to decide between a few dishes, the waitress suggested their fish and chips.Being quite hungry, I asked if it was a fairly decent portion and she promised 3 generous portions of fish atop a mountain of fries. I ordered a house salad to start for \"only\" an extra $3.99   Now the reason some places get unfavorable reviews is because their expectations are made so much higher than what they receive. I know a Burger King double cheeseburger is not going to fill me if I order one, so I am not disappointed when I order one. My salad arrives- browning, wilted, bagged salad mix. There was not one extra thing put on this mix, no croutons, olives, tomatoes, - nothing. I paid $4.00 for a plate of old lettuce that the manager should have refused to let be served-even to a rabbit. My meal arrives- A handful of less than ordinary fries with 3 fish sticks on top. I am not kidding! These 3 \"generous\" portions of fish were barely bigger than what you would get out of a Gordon's fish sticks box.    the waitress told me this was their most popular lunch item. What? The soup and sushi roll combo that my friend ordered looked decent but I wont ever find out since I will not be returning."}
{"text":"The service and quality/portion-to-price food here is simply outstanding. I can't begin to explain how my first visit to this location changed the way I feel about customer service nowadays. From the moment we were sat, both Tina, our server, and Mike--the BEST manager in the industry--displayed a sincerest genuine interest in taking amazing care of us. He made sure our meals were prepared to our liking, brought me a courtesy cell phone charger, (yes... He's the General Manager), brought us a sample of an appetizer to our table due to the simple fact of asking him what a table across from us had ordered because it looked so delicious (beer battered onion rings btw :-), actually engaged in conversation with not just us but all of the guests; meanwhile Tina's attention to us was also incredibly above-and-beyond as well. Our waters never went less than half-full, and just her overall friendly presence was enough for me to understand what kind of leadership they have here. Mike, thank you, and we DEFINITELY plan on coming back very soon. There happy hour here looks incredibly enticing as well. These people seriously made our day and went above and beyond more than I can explain and about only making this up because I'm so used to terrible customer service at other restaurants and this place blew my mind. The other elephant bar locations in Orlando and Sacramento I have had great experiences but not nearly as great as the specific location I highly recommend it to everybody. Tell Mike and Tina that Mike C. sent you! By the way just ordering the old-style nachos and the midday lunch crusted chicken breast was more than that for me I could hardly finish it. Simply the best service and experience!"}
{"text":"The food isn't that great, does not make you want to come back for more. Service is ok. I don't really know how they are still operating with the kind of menu they have. You can find their gift cards $80 for $100 value at costco if you love this place."}
{"text":"Though the restaurant has changed menus, I still find the eclectic combination of \"world cuisine\" to be steange enpugh to make me feel like Im eating at a fancy place, but safe enough that I can order just about anything knowing it will be good.  This is the place I take my wife when we need to have a special moment. The atmosphere is wonderful, the wait staff is friendly, and the open kitchen inspires confidence.  5 stars, I love this place."}
{"text":"I enjoy the bar here but did you know they got rid of the pretzel appetizer? It was my favorite. :( Nice setting with quality food every time I have been although this location seems to have an elderly crowd. Over the period of an hour I saw at least 40 people slowly meander in and go to the back where they have some sort of senior get together."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go! The happy hour is amazing and the staff is always friendly and attentive. If you sit at the bar, Shawn is one of the best on staff. I have ordered almost everything on the menu at some point and never once been disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few different Elephant Bars and one thing seems common between all of them - inconsistency.  Some nights I'll order the teriyaki chicken and it will be GREAT. Other times it is lacking flavor or tastes like it was microwaved quickly. It's a shame, because when it's good - it's GOOD.  I love their salads (tropical citrus adventure) and the coconut fried shrimp skewers are great (the sauce makes them that much more amazing). I've ordered the Tempura Salmon Roll and Pan Asian Soup with Teriyaki Chicken Skewer ($9.95) a number of times and it usually hits the spot, but I've always wished the soup had more flavor and maybe less (or smaller) veggies. Sometimes the Roll is great, other times it makes me wish I'd ordered something else!  The alcohol is measured in every drink here, so I'd recommend ordering a beer that compliments whatever you're eating. You're paying for a watery beverage with close to no alcohol otherwise.  I recommend ordering an appetizer or two as a meal, or going with the Pacific Rim Specialties. These are normally the best.  I was excited to see lobster ravioli on the menu once (it's not a regular menu item) and didn't hesitate to order it. Unfortunately, I found the ravioli to be COLD and the sauce was rather bland. I probably could've gone to Costco and made better lobster ravioli from a bag.  If you're planning on ordering the Jambalaya, go during the lunch special when it's almost $5 cheaper and it's fresh. It's not the best jambalaya (I've had tons of jambalaya in Louisiana) - but it's decent with a good amount of shrimp, usually.  One thing I like about this place is that they give gift cards all of the time. If you go in and buy someone else a $10 gift card - you get at least a $5 gift card. I was with a friend and we wanted to buy our boss a gift card for $20. We each got a $5 gift card. They also give you Elephant Bar cards you can use during lunch for a discount on the total bill.  All in all, if you're near the district and you're hungry - stop in during the lunch special and eat something. Don't order alcohol unless it's beer, and don't eat outside by the gate opening. People walk in and out of that thing and it slams so hard/loud that your experience there will be ruined!"}
{"text":"This review is for the bar.   We got there at 8:55 and were strictly warned that happy hour drinks were not available until 9pm.  Hmm.  Better ways to approach that, considering we were a party of four and planning on ordering three rounds at the least. Bartender was at best understaffed, but I could say I'd rather pay her extra to not have to deal with her fake over pitched attempt at being cordial.   Many customers drop down from their green valley condos to stroll in for a \"neighborhood\" drink, so I'd say this bartender's bitchy blue light need to get laid attitude Is costing this restaurant a plenty.  And did I mention, no music?  Plainly put, unless you aspire to spending your evening entranced about how miserable she feels about her job, which, par for the course is mandatory, take your hard earned time and money somewhere else.  And ps; this bartender dipped her finger in my fathers beer to check if it was cold enough.  You're dead to me, skank bitch."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times with the wife, food and service was good. Nice sandwich selection, decent serving sizes."}
{"text":"I used to love the elephant bar. We used to go about twice a month at least and now I find myself looking for other places. The food has been much more inconsistent and I keep trying to find something new to love and only find like. The jambalaya sauce has been different twice and neither time was the same as the other. The Thai salad dressing no longer has that great ginger flavor. I do like their burgers and the honey shrimp is good but not as yummy as my jambalaya used to be.   They do have great email specials and coupons and I will keep trying hoping that it goes back to the way it was. The service is always great and we usually ask for the same two or three servers whenever we go. I love the atmosphere as well. Just after a couple eh meals I am sad!"}
{"text":"Elephant Bar's decor creates a sort of trendier version of Applebee's...if it were set in the jungle.  The service is very friendly and accomodating, and that alone earns them a star.  The food, on the other hand, is just sort of...blah.  No, it wasn't necessarily bad, it was just very bland.  My mom and I split the grilled shrimp salad (don't remember what it was called, but I think it was supposed to be Asian-influenced), and the catfish fillet with mango salsa.  The salad was pretty good, but how can you really go wrong with grilled shrimp and salad?    The fish, however, was completely flavorless.  It was like they didn't bother to season it AT ALL - no salt, no pepper, no nothing.  The only time my taste buds had anything to do at all was when I took a bite of fish with the mango salsa (thank goodness for mango salsa!).  The rice wasn't even good.  It was so dry and flavorless, with each grain scattered across the plate trying to escape from one another.  I like my rice fluffy and soft, with just enough moisture for all the grains to want to stick together.  To be fair, I wasn't really expecting much from the food here, so I can't say I was terribly disappointed.  Since I live in New York, I probably won't ever return to Elephant Bar.  It's almost funny to me how memorably bland the food was.  Then again, I should have known better, because you can't spell \"bland\" without B-A-D."}
{"text":"Not good at all - food was more like Golden Corral crap that came out of a can than well prepared.   Sorry to be negative."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Service was phenomenal and the food was great and priced right. And the waitress made my niece's birthday special."}
{"text":"I have to say that I LOVE Elephant Bar, in general.  Happy hour is a great deal, and the portions are perfect.  The drinks are fun and yummy.  I've loved the Scottsdale location and the Henderson location.  We just moved, and this EB is about 10 minutes from our new house.  In the last three weeks, we've been there three times.  I keep going back wanting to love it as much as I have in the past, at other locations...but I just can't.  The servers don't seem to smile (suggests to me that morale sucks at this location), the food is so-so, and tonight we got something brought to the table COLD..twice...and it should've been steaming hot.  Both my husband and I have had upset tummies since our dinner there this evening, to boot.  Being new to this area, I rely on Yelp reviews, and I thought this might be helpful.  While Elephant Bar might be great in some other areas, the Chandler location is a big AVOID in my books.  Especially when Chandler has at least 10 other great restaurants within walking distance of this EB."}
{"text":"Went out with two other couples to socialize, eat and have a few cocktails at the Elephant Bar.    I ordered up the crispy teriyaki chicken along with an iceberg wedge salad which I found both to just ok.  $12.95 for the chicken was a tad much given that the portion was not all that.  The temperature of the food was slightly above lukewarm.  The iceberg wedge for almost $5 came from a very small head of lettuce.  The drinks were good but pricey.  The atmosphere inside is safari'ish in it's decor.  More attentive servers would absolutely add to the experience."}
{"text":"I usually come here with coworkers for some special occasion lunch - like a birthday or something like that. Also a few happy hours for leaving coworkers. As far as food that I've had here - the Japanese Ahi Rice Bowl was pretty good. Can't go wrong with Ahi and every time I've had it, it's been fresh. I also had their Misoyaki Fire Grilled Salmon which was pretty good as well. I must say of all these Chandler Mall/Chandler Blvd Strip restaurants we  frequent for company functions - Majerle's, Keg,  Firebirds, Chili's - this place has my favorite menu.  And I like the layout of the place as well. We usually park in the back - south part of the restaurant and enter via the secret back door entrance on the southeast corner - \"sneaking in\" as the waitresses who catch us say. Service has usually been decent. We're usually too caught up in conversations to notice so we'd really only notice if it was bad and that hasn't been the case."}
{"text":"I was with a table of people all in their late 30's. (including myself)  We were all carded for booze. They asked for a government issued ID. So, since I have grey hair in my beard and didnt have my license in my wallet, I gave him my concealed carry permit (issued by the government) The server had to ask the manager who told me that I could not have the drink I ordered even though I was over 30. You need to be 21 to drink in NV. They have some retards working there for sure."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Green Valley Ranch Resort and we were thrilled to find this Elephant Bar.  Several locations have closed where we live and it is one of our favorite restaurant chains.  We were so pleasantly surprised by how this particular location operated.  The menu has changed, much smaller (it was too big before) but still featuring some real stand-out items.  My wife and my daughter were treated to incredible meals, I had a pistachio crusted fish sandwich that is the best fish sandwich that I have had anywhere, perfectly cooked, fresh ingredients, wonderful.  Our server was warm from the moment that she came to our table, she was attentive, kind, gave us memorable service so much so that I asked to talk to the manager about her.  Sometimes you have to let a manager or supervisor know when someone is going above and beyond and our server did in every way.  There are many restaurants in the area, let alone in Las Vegas, but on our next trip down we will be going back to Elephant Bar on the strength of this service and experience."}
{"text":"Happy hour? Let's go to the Elephant Bar!  Located in the District directly next to the GVR, it's easy to find.  There is plenty of parking in this area.  I usually have better luck parking in the back for easy access to the restaurant.  I've had good visits the majority of the time I have dined here.  They have great happy hour specials in the bar area.  The food has been great and pretty consistent.  The french onion sliders are fabulous.  Simple and Wonderful! The nachos are plentiful and great to share.  The buffalo chicken wontons are just ok to me.  I'd stick to the sliders and nachos for happy hour.  Their market cobb salad entree is delicious.  The chicken has a great seasoning which makes this salad yummy.    The service here for us has been hit and miss.   Sometimes my drink is empty for a while.   I've noticed on a few occasions during happy hour the bartenders are more interested in talking to each other than their customers.  Hmmm.  But mostly they have been good and attentive.  It's a chain restaurant but it's one of those that I enjoy!"}
{"text":"Chose the lamb chop from their midday menu, absolutely wonderful and a great bargain! Only $12.50 for a top notch meal in the afternoon. They also will substitute the garlic mashed potatoes for brown rice if you're watching carbs. Great service and a lovely property."}
{"text":"Our server Emily A. was definitely the most memorable server we've had in a long time, not in a good way.  I can't believe I waited so long to write about her.    Elephant Bar and Grill is Americanized version of Asian food.  The food is edible and there is a good variety to choose from.  Keep an eye out for coupons in your Sunday coupon section.  Unfortunately, our server was totally kooky.  When we had a couple questions about the menu, she would answer randomly and incorrectly as we later found out..  Some entrees come with rice and some come with sushi style (vinegar & sugar) rice.  We gave up on getting any clear answers from her.  When we asked for low sodium soy sauce (the one with the green cap) she said they didn't have any.  We thought that was strange but continued with our lunch.  Then near the end of our meal, she comes out with a low sodium soy sauce bottle and asks with the most unsure, weird expression, \"Is THIS what you wanted?\"  Yes, that's what we wanted, but now we're almost done eating.  Thanks.  There was also an issue with the bill being calculated incorrectly which the manager had to correct.  The food was okay, but the service is lacking."}
{"text":"Good service, Vincent was our waiter, he was very attentive and when I told him that I was a transitioning Vegan he was very patient with me and gave me time to explore menu options.    Restaurant was clean as usual, this is our 2nd time there in the last 2 months and we had a good time...The only complaint is that I ordered the tofu sandwich and wow, the tofu was hard as a rock--my friend was with me and she could not eat bite into it as it was too hard for her teeth--someone either over cooked it or thats how it comes?    Maybe that is the trick to eating low fat, the food is so hard, you cant eat it and you naturally lose weight!  I complained and it was sent back and money was refunded but just be careful, make sure to tell the waiter to make the tofu much much....um  much less crispy!     :O)"}
{"text":"Sat in bar area belly up at bar so we could watch March Madness games.  2 of the bartenders barely minded us and had to flag them down multiple times to put in order and drinks.  It was slow too, no excuse.  As for the food, I liken it to an Applebees as far as taste. I had shrimp and chicken parm. They also had closed captioning on tv's which took up half of the screen and when asked to turn off bartender said he couldn't.  What?"}
{"text":"This place is great and one of my favorite happy hour spots.  The customer service here is great. Food is delicious and you can not beat the happy hour prices on the appetizers and drinks. They have patio seating where you can enjoy happy hour as well."}
{"text":"Great service! For a table of about 12 for a retirement luncheon the servers topped off all drinks at a consistent and frequent basis. Rare to find these days. Maybe it helps that a couple loyal guests knew the manager and have been always kind. The manager greeted the locals and the rest of the team with smiles and laughs. Always good to see a manager interact with his customers for a short moment.   Before ordering the sever asked if we wanted separate checks or one bill and someone on our group made the executive decision to go with one bill. 2 servers started asking each person for their order.   Their menu items show calories per entree. It is rather daunting that my decision for selecting a plate had changed when I saw that the garlic Alfredo pasta was around 1840 calories!! Sheesh I believe that's roughly almost a day's worth of caloric consumption for a lady my size! I'm not a person to count calories on what I consume but that number was too astounding for me to even order it. Sadly, i didn't choose it and went with their chimichurri garden burger- which was half the calories. The \"bad fried\" parts was the fried onion strings and my choice of fries. (Other choice is salad).  Kind of defeats my choosing this instead of the Alfredo pasta. Oh well. The garden burger was pretty decent. I'm a firm believer of trying new foods.   At the end of the lunch we received our check. Everyone contributed equal payment which was easy and painless."}
{"text":"This is a mess of Asian and American food with a splash of other pacific rim flavors. The mix maybe good to some, but if you're talking to me it's not. Restaurants like this and many other chain restaurants, they try to do too many and too much to be good or great at all. Not to mention I've been here three times and each time the food was inconsistent from the previous time. I can go on and on about the food. But a restaurant that try its hands with Asian food. They can't cook rice. Can't cook rice they can cook anything else. It's the basic quintessential prerequisite skill to have. It's sometimes dry and sometimes mushy. It ruins the main entree thus making the complete experience horrible"}
{"text":"Coming out of an early movie at Green Valley and felt like an early dinner (happy hour!!!). Nice evening, so outdoors seating is a big plus. We had no wait at Elephant Bar. We ordered the chicken lettuce wraps, coconut shrimp skewers, and a Sam Adams. $6 each. We shared everything. Terrific ambiance. Tasty food. Dinner for 2 for $18. Great value. Fun dinning."}
{"text":"Being from Salt Lake, we had never heard of the Elephant Bar.  We were visiting friends in Phoenix and they suggested the restaurant, only one of the two friends had been to the bar before.  The atmosphere was lively and fun.  The menu items looked delicious; it was hard to choose.  The four of us placed our orders: build your own burger, island tilapia, rib-eye and jumbo shrimp, and shrimp adventure.  Everyone raved about their food.  It was delicious.  The service is the only reason I gave the restaurant four stars instead of five.  The waitress had to be reminded a few times about drinks, condiments, etc."}
{"text":"A group of seven of us came here last Saturday night for dinner. Very middle of the road. Nothing to rave about, nothing to complain about. Food was decent, service was decent, and overall everything was okay. Can't say I'm DYING to go back, but if someone else suggested it, I wouldn't protest; probably more of an afternoon lunch restaurant instead of dinner. There are better places for dinner for the same prices."}
{"text":"Okay, i'm not usually into writing reviews for chain restuarants but i felt i may as well since it seems a number of others have less than great reviews for this joint.  First, this verision of Elephant Bar is not a well kept as the others in the system (kind o beat up furnature, fixutres, etc)...as somebody who travels a bit for trade shows I've dined in a few in Californa (LA and Oakland)...Food is pretty much spot on and the drinks are always welcome.  Happy Hour is a plus...  however this was the first time dining here in my home town...A few industry folks met for lunch here and had a nice experience - mainly because of our server...Cynthia (dark hair, kinda short) was wonderful and handled our myriad speical requests with ease...some of us can be quite a pain (dietary stuff, hold this, extra that) and demanding (refills please!)...anyway - she was great, funny, cute and quick to help.  Food was pretty decent (as usual), we ordered a few aps - fried shrimp and all had entrees (I had mahi fish and chips how can you go wrong)...our server was also good at getting us into cocktails -thankfully becuase i really wanted one but was waiting to see if the others dove in - she made it happen!  Anyhow...overall a fun lunch that turned into an afternoon...and happy hour time!"}
{"text":"New owners decided to eliminate the Senior Rewards Card in favor of a new and very lame \"reward\": 3 visits earns $5.00!!! Wow!!! I am underwhelmed. Won't be dining at Elephant Bar ever again. Smart move!"}
{"text":"Just had a great dinner with the hubby. Fabulous personal service from our waitress Danielle!! She suggested great choices for starters, dinner and dessert! We had lettuce wraps to start, a steak and shrimp soup for dinner. Finished it off with an amazing cheesecake! Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Chicken/shrimp Jamba was aca-awesome! Vanessa is crazy-cool-outstanding service. Can't wait to come back for some more happy happy happy hour :)"}
{"text":"I love the coconut shrimp appetizer.  The sauces are great and the shrimp is yummy.  However, they put a side salad on the plate, which is good to cut the sweetness of the dish.  However, it is literally a pile of dry lettuce.  It needs some sort of drizzle of balsamic / citrus vinegarette.    When I asked the waitress about it, she said a lot of people ask for dressing. Perhaps management should listen."}
{"text":"I do admit, this one was one of the better chain experiences I have had.   This was another one of ma's great adventures into culinary mediocrity. But since I am the youngest, I get to go along for the ride when she feels the urge.   Actually this one was my mom treating my girlfriend to her birthday meal.   My mom ordered some really big drink and I'm pretty sure I remember bamboo sticking out of it...It was interesting for sure.  I had a grilled portobello something or other. Tasty, but I was distracted by the crazy animal prints all over the place for most of the meal.  My girlfriend had chicken marsala, which I liked better than my meal. Nice sauteed spinach with garlic on the side. That one got approval from the whole table.  I truly cannot remember for the life of me what my mom had. She loved it whatever it was.   The place was a ghost town at the lunch hour. But well, huge square footage in a recession is never a good idea is it?"}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with this Philly Cheesesteak. Overall everything good at this outpost of the chain. The appetizers had some potential with a decent version of coconut shrimp and potstickers. The spinach dip could use some help though. The sandwich was packed with ribeye steak, onions, peppers and provolone cheese. It came (for 99 cents extra) with a loaded baked potato and that too had a good amount of cheese and bacon. Food is usually reliable at this chain."}
{"text":"OMG, where do I begin? I had lunch Sunday afternoon while the place was dead. We were seated and waited on quickly. I was halfway done with my yummy entree of  chicken fried rice when I found a red twist tie in it! Needless to say, I didn't finish the meal. I spoke to the manager who was very apologetic and comped the meal, offered another, dessert, basically anything I wanted, but this was the second time I've found a foreign object in my meal eating here (the first time was last year) so I left a tip and walked out. No more trips to Elephant Bar for me.  . .EVER!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing and so was our service from Josè! Thank you for an awesome dinner!!! We had a great time!"}
{"text":"My first time here and it definitely won't be my last.  I've been in Vegas for a little over a year and always looking for a new place to eat.  If you are in town or you've never been here, do yourself a favor a GET HERE NOW!  Make sure you ask for Danielle as your server.  She was quick, efficient and kind.  I got the lamb shank (huge portion) and my partner got the top sirloin.  Both were cooked to perfection and seasoned beautifully. We'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Anytime you see pictures on the menu figure a chain. The food is slightly worse than mediocre. The service is OK. There are much better places in the area and this place is ok if you can't get into the other places."}
{"text":"Ok really bad service.. Walked in.. No one greeted us.. So we walked to the bar and still nothing.. We ended up walking out .. I yelled out THANKS! Never coming here again!"}
{"text":"Went out with friends yesterday. Service was great. Staff was very friendly and able to seat us right away. It went bad from there. The air conditioner was on at the front of the building but the other 75% of the restaurant was extremely hot. Some of the food tasted uncooked and we probably will not go back there again. Go to PF changs or anywhere else if you are in the district."}
{"text":"Here for dinner, the food was average and the service was slow and somewhat impersonal. I had the tacos, son had the pot roast and husband had the petite sirloin. First of all what restaurant worth its salt here doesn't have Cholula's?! Then takes 5 minutes to find their bottle of Tabasco? Anyway, the meal wasn't memorable but the service was...in a bad way."}
{"text":"We met my aunt, unlce, dad, step mom, and in-laws there for dinner with our 1 year old along with us.  The place has a family atmosphere, lots and lots of little ones.  The service was quick and courteous.  The food was about what you'd expect from a chain like this:  generous portions, tasty prep (if not inspired), chain-like recipes and menu.  I had ribs and a mojito, which hit the spot.  Plenty of rum, a tad heavy on the lime, plenty of mint."}
{"text":"I've only been to the elephant bar a handful of times and the food isn't too bad. It's nothing I would crave although the Cajun chicken dish I got this last time was pretty tasty and spicy. Lance was our server on Halloween night and was super accommodating. I hate to be a pain but also don't think it hurts to ask about switching things up. He was able to accommodate all our needs and did it without acting inconvenienced at all which is always nice. Although the food was good, I'd go back just due to how nice the server was...especially on Halloween when it's busy and full of kids people usually seem a little \"short\" and he didn't at the slightest. I also thought it was awesome they handed out free kids meals that night during trick or treating and we were able to use our coupons immediately. Good end to a nice night with the kiddos."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch!! Lettuce Wraps are always the bomb, the Street Tacos another big hit and our bartender/server, Mickey is so fine!"}
{"text":"1st time here, food was great! service was fast and very friendly!  Nice atmosphere, love the District :)"}
{"text":"If I was ranking the Elephant bar on the food alone it would receive only one star.    Every dish I have tried had bad flavor.  Many of the dishes attempt to infuse the sweetness of various fruits which I do not like unless it is appropriate (it never was on this menu).  It seems like the chef that designed the menu thinks that everyone in the jungle (or wherever its theme is from) eats fruits mixed in their savory meals.   I have to admit that I have only ordered appetizers and entrees and have never tried a dessert.  The bar made fine martinis"}
{"text":"So we went here for Mother's Day. Wait time was long but expected for the holiday. Our waitress was very friendly but once we were seated was not very attentive. As soon as we received our appetizer a minute later our entrées were brought out which I hate when restaurants do this because it makes me feel rushed to eat and get out and the food sitting there gets cold. My husband and oldest daughter enjoyed their food. My steak was a bit bland so I had to add salt and my jumbo prawns were missing the lemon slice (I'm not sure if this is not normally served with prawns but normally most venues I've been to serve a slice of lemon when any type of seafood is served). I asked the waitress if it had been forgotten and she just told me she would bring some out for me. After about 10min she finally brought some but by then my prawns were pretty cold. My youngest daughter ordered the chicken quesadilla and it was smothered in cheese. She is 4 and while eating she started choking because the cheese was so stringy it clogged her airway. We were pretty scared about the incident and brought it to the attention of our waitress. She told us she would get her manager. After about another 10 min go by the manager \"Kim\" came by and asked what it was that occurred we told her and she didn't seem to really care. She just said ok she's ok now and told us if we need anything else to let her know. No apology or empathy for what had occurred. I don't know if she thought we were trying to get a free meal or file a lawsuit but I felt like she just really didn't care. So for this we will not be gracing this venue with our patronage ever again. There are plenty of other restaurants that would love us to dine at their venue and will appreciate our business."}
{"text":"Had elephant bar 3 times, in 2 different states.   They're all the same mix of confusion. I seriously can't put my finger on what exactly throw me off about this place..  maybe it's the extremely large variety in types of food (Chinese/American/Cajun/Italian/Vietnamese/Add WhateverElseYouCanThinkOf), the Jungle Galore decor that makes me think I'm in Africa, or the \"just meh\" staff. This whole chain needs to focus on a specialty food in order for it to be good, seems like they are way too spread on on trying to fill every niche. That's the part that doesn't impress anyone.  Overpriced. Overrated. Gah."}
{"text":"Vanessa our server was AMAZING super nice, great recommendations, and made the end of our night perfect. Just want to say thanks to her and tell the Elephant Bar you are very lucky to have her :) #GOHAWKS!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few different occasions, all for different reasons.  Sort of standard fair in big city environments.  It is along the same lines of The CheeseCake Factory.  Do not come here expecting freshly made meals with creativity and pure taste.  Come here expecting a very large menu.  You have the option to order nearly any type of food you could want, from mexican to chinese and everywhere in between.  The main issue I have with the place is that due to the large menu of options, almost everything is frozen, fried, canned, or stuff with preservatives.  Personally, I prefer fresh, simple food with a few options specifically chosen for that restaurant.  But this can be a decent place to go with family or friends for some drinks and food, and you can be certain it will be served friendly and clean."}
{"text":"We love to go for happy hour! Great Deals! Been going to the elephant bar for a few years and the HH food and drinks are at some good, reasonable prices.  We have yet to dine in the full dining room, but im sure the service, consistency is all the same.  Bartenders are attentive and friendly.  Missed 1 star because every time i order the Vietnamese shrimp rolls, they are hard and stale, I should just learn LOL."}
{"text":"Love this place.   Crispy Teriyaki chicken is really good. Burgers are good too.  Dessert was strawberry shortcake.  Yum yum. I've never had a bad meal here"}
{"text":"I have never tasted something and had an immediate association with a movie until tonight.  The second the water hit my tongue I thought of Shawshank Redemption and knew that the river of shit that Tim Robbins swam through is the same water which was currently in the glass on my table.   Just as concerning as the taste of sewer was the waitress's reaction when I told her that something tasted very wrong with the water and asked for a diet coke: she had none.  She didn't make any comment or ask me any question.  She said, sure, I can bring you a diet coke.  When she returned with the diet coke I inquired if anything in my glass from the pop to the ice cubes to the glass had at any point shared anything that could have been in my water.  She said no, almost cheerily.  To her credit she was like 17 and thinking of what she is going to wear to her prom, but WTF.  The ahi tuna was dry as shit and tasted as though I was eating something that had an adhesive layer I was meant to remove.  I actually tried to remove part of it.  No adhesive. Sadly.  This place is on my mother's \"fabulous happy hours\" list.  I never had any faith in this list, but as I was just visiting in the past I played along,  as she thinks that any place that has any kind of happy hour is fabulous.  Now that I am going to live here, no more."}
{"text":"no. not ever. never never never never again.   i remember elephant bar when it was adjacent to chris town mall (!) and i remember liking it, but i was 12 so that may not be totally accurate.  anyhow, i've never left a restaurant with absolutely nothing good to say about it. until now. it was awful. i'm sorry, except for the calamari appetizer, which for some reason i liked. it was 95% awful.  i ordered some \"shrimp adventure/shrimp ahoy/shrimp bonanza\" sort of thing, because i hadn't had shrimp in awhile and it sounded tasty. horrendous. of the 3 types, only 1 was mediocre, the butterflied fried kind.  the grilled ones were still GRAY and cold. the \"shrimp on a stick\", which i think was coconut prawns, were stingy and over-fried, not to mention they left the tail on. mmmmm crunchy.  now, i did tell my server about the undone shrimp and he was apologetic and asked me what i'd like to replace it. i said fried shrimp, which took 25 minutes to get there. the manager came over and apologized, offering us a free dessert. we went for it. we shouldn't have. it was apple-blueberry cobbler with walnut streusel. it tasted like unevenly cooked, gooey potpourri...or at least what i imagine that tastes like.   in the end, we did have a very good and prompt server, so he got a nice tip. it's not his fault the kitchen staff can't find their rear with both hands."}
{"text":"Manager was nice as he comped my meal today. Chicken tacos were prepared differently with the chicken chopped, but that was a slight improvement over the full filet version. Some ingredients were missing though on this new version and the salad they served this time was a complete embarrassment. It was old wilted lettuce with no dressing as the oriental salad of last time disappeared. Angela was still nice and chatty and the bar was 100 percent empty again, so it was good to see at least that didn't change."}
{"text":"Why did The Cheesecake Factory change their name? Because this is just a really poor imitation of it.   It was really busy when I met a friend there one evening for drinks, but managed to snag a couple of seats at the bar. I barely saw the rest of the restaurant and only going to and from the bathroom (where I almost killed myself on their weird flooring leading to it - watch out in heels). It really did just seem like an old take on TCF or some other chain that you really don't want to spend an evening drinking in.  The service is dismal. I know I'm at a bar and that I expect to be served drinks. How dare I! If your thing is being ignored right in front of the bartender's face then you will dig this joint.   We practically begged to get served. It was really not nice. Not only am I in a crowded bar without enough room to move, but I'm also not getting drinks to soothe my frazzled nerves OR getting a menu OR water. I suppose I'm there to serve as a warning to other people who might think this is a good idea.  We ordered food which was so forgettable I've forgotten what it was. Not to beat a dead horse, but think TCF without the taste.   Had I been the one paying I would have expressed my unhappiness in the form of a 10% tip (and that would have been a seriously good tip since, you know, I was trying To Insure Prompt Service and failed), but the guy I was with was nicer than I was. Well, I have an idea, so I don't have to worry about that again I just won't go back."}
{"text":"Went a few days ago with my family. I would give the food 3 stars, but it was the service that was amazing, 5 stars. Our server Phil was one of the best servers I have had. Very friendly, gave great suggestions on food, and kept the glasses full.  Great service!  As for the food, it was good. We got the shrimp sampler which was good. My wife and I also shared a ribeye and shrimp. The ribeye was ok but I have had better. My daughter ordered the corn dog and I thought it was really weird that it cam with cole slaw. Odd side for a kids plate."}
{"text":"How do you spell average?  e-l-e-p-h-a-n-t-b-a-r  how do you spell mediocre?  e-l-e-p-h-a-n-t-b-a-r  how do you spell blah?  (hint: starts with an E)  e-l-e-p-h-a-n-t-b-a-r!  if you ever ask someone if they can recommend a movie, and they tell you go see independence day! then that is the sort of person you send to elephant bar.  blaaaaaaaaaah.  it is in the ranks of firebird's and so on.  i can't claim that the food is bad because it's so resoundingly mediocre.  if you are looking for a boring way to sustain life for just long enough to have a boring night with boring people in a boring place and on a boring day of the week, at a boring time of day, and with boring food and boring drink, boring menus and boring specials, boring beers and boring desserts, all while being mind-numbingly bored, then I say to you:  e-l-e-p-h-a-n-t-b-a-r"}
{"text":"very good food  :) friendly, casual and always welcomed with a smile. will be back!"}
{"text":"This is another of what I think seems to be very prevalent here: dress up the place, and the public won't guess that the quality of the food is no better than the local Chili's, Outback, whatever.  I found the quality of the food to be average to poor.  The service was good.  The pricing?  Overpriced.  I was in the restaurant, and looked over the greener grass to the bar area.  Maybe I will try the bar, if you could convince me to go again."}
{"text":"This place was nothing fantastic. We started with spring rolls and they were average. Then I had the Pacific Cove salad, which was a little too fishy and I am not sure I liked how each item was segregated on the plate. The crab and shrimp seemed like they were just pulled from the freezer. Everything was just okay. For the money it wasn't worth it.   The atmosphere was nothing special either... just another regular chain-like setting."}
{"text":"Since I have only been here once I'm only giving this 3 stars. It may go up to 4 in the future :-)  I went here for lunch and it was busy. Service was extremely efficient and quick. She even split our checks and you know how they hate doing that.  I had the wedge salad & the soy-ginger calamari - both excellent.  Two of my companions had the jambalaya and thought it was great. The veggie burger was a big miss. The other burger ordered was wrapped in paper, prompting me to ask if we had gone to In & Out Burger and maybe I just didn't realize it.   Strange decor. Nice enough, they have this whole safari/jungle theme going on (along with a las vegas style carpet LOL). Their menu is all over the place - there is no rhyme or reason to it. They're mixing up asian & cajun & american & all kinds of stuff. But the food is good, or at least what I've had so far."}
{"text":"This place is alright! Not really fond of this Resturant but I'll still eat at this chain establishment. Don't really have any complaints."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to this restaurant. The experience was very average and the waitress could have been friendlier. The calamari was horrible and drinks were watered down. The saving grace was the tomato soup and fried green beans. This will not be a go to spot for me."}
{"text":"First off, anyone who knows me would be SHOCKED that I would go to a chain let alone this place but I got a gift card for Christmas so I thought I would go use it up last night. So I go in and it all started off ok. Bartender seemed nice enough. Bourbon selection was what you could expect from a place like this so I got myself a Maker's on the rocks and perused the menu. Since I wasn't paying I figured I'd order a nice big meal and relax for a bit. When the bartender came over I started ordering but I only got out the appetizer (Edamame) and Salad (Pear Gorgonzola) when she started walking off. I had to get her attention and stop her so I could finish ordering. It was rather odd if you ask me but again, you can't get your hopes up too much in a place like this.  A little while later, and I really thought it took a bit longer than it should, someone comes out with the Edamame AND salad at the same time. It took a second for the person to finally get it when I kept telling them that I didn't want them at the same time. She seemed awfully confused by the fact that I would want to sit and enjoy my edamame and THEN eat my salad. I sent the salad back with a bad feeling it would just sit in the window, which is what it did because it took the bartender seconds to go back to get it and bring it out. Quite obvious that they just set it back in the kitchen.  When I finally ate my salad it was nothing special. I don't know why but it was insanely boring even though it sounded like it should be good. I'm not even that picky of an eater, but only finished it so that I wouldn't get my entree spit in and I was hungry so I didn't feel like waiting forever.  I order a Ribeye for dinner as I was starving for protein and iron. I couldn't believe, once again, how flipping boring this steak was. Luckily I still had soy sauce close by so I poured some on to get a little flavor. Even the  mashed potatoes were lack luster. They tried to be \"fancy\" a put a ridiculous rosemary sprig in it, but it just didn't save the bland food.   After only two drinks they RAN OUT of Maker's Mark. I REALLY couldn't believe they had no back up. I just can't imagine the people who hang out at this bar are drinking up Makers so that tells me they don't stock well. I wound up drinking Jack since the only other \"high end\" bourbon they had was Woodford, which I don't really think is a decent whiskey to drink straight.   All in all it was an experience that just backs up my distaste for these chain restaurants. Boring food, mediocre service, and mind numbing atmosphere. I don't get why these places are successful but then again, I don't McDonald's or Taco Bell and they are successful too.   If you are in the District go to Balboa Pizza or King's Fish House. Save your money and your taste buds from this place."}
{"text":"'Twas fine. No great shakes.  Hadn't been in one before.  Campy but spacious and clean interior.  Liked the booths.  It wasn't very busy (10pm Thurs) but even so the open kitchen was noisy.  Prompt friendly service.  Veggie burger: mediocre.  Very thin patty.  Provolone cheese option was good. Very hard, dry, thin bun...weird, actually.  Seared tuna with Ponzu sauce appie: Fine. Service on this plate has to be fast because it's on the heat for such a short time & if slow, it arrives cold.  It did.  Mojito Classic (the cheap one): from a mix with token mint leaves added.  Meh.  Cold herb tea ginger drink: good.  It got us in out of the cold, fed us but didn't particularly warm us.  Not a destination in our books."}
{"text":"I do not have a problem with this place at all.  I tend to think of 3 stars as less than an average score but in reality it's as stated, \"A-OK\".  I usually come here at night for their HH and to get an app or two and have never been disappointed.  I have also never been wowed.  Their food is tasty and wide ranging, their drinks are fruity but still a bit pricey, even on HH, their bartenders and servers are cordial and are not shy to strike up a conversation, and the atmosphere is nice.  Definitely a good place to stop in if you are checking out The District's other haunts."}
{"text":"Great place, cold beer, quality food and presentation. Lacking in service standards. We got our starters way after our salad, order wine for our main entrees and she delivered while still working on our beer, server took my forks one with my starter and one with my salad plate waited for a fork after my main dish arrived and had to wave to another employee to get a fork.  \"Attention to detail\" plays a huge role in this industry hoping for better experience next time. I love this place but need services to be on point."}
{"text":"First - this has always been a favorite place for a nice lunch at a casual dining restaurant. Have been there many times. But... Think about it.. You own a restaurant. Wouldn't you want the person up front welcoming the guests - to actually WELCOME them? The petite young woman who had that job today seemed afraid of us. Spoke so softly we couldn't hear her.  People familiar with the restaurant know of the row of booths against the far back wall. We could see that one was empty and asked to be seated there. She (very tiny) strained to see the booths, looked at her chart, and said that none was available. We asked her to look again, so she walked off to where she could see, came back, and waved us to come along. Said not a word. So, from the time we walked in, till the time we walked back to our booth - not one word of welcome, no smile, no nuthin'. Ashley (Ashleigh, perhaps) is a strikingly attractive young waitress. Until she learned we were going to use one of Elephant Bar's specials. Body language drooped. Smiles went away. But she did take the order. Lettuce wraps came out first.. and they were perfect. And the waiter (not Ashley) put them on the table and left. I called after him and asked for the little plates that always accompany them. After awhile, he brought them, too. Again, both times, said not a word. Ashley passed by and I asked for another napkin.. She said 'sure' and then didn't bring anything. Then our meals came. My wife's was just right. The Thai chicken stir fry. I had ordered the petite sirloin. Looked fine. And then I (tried to) cut it. Was not easy. Chewing it was the real challenge. I should have sent it back but instead tried to eat it. I finally stopped. The plate was half uneaten steak - half little clumps of napkin with chewed steak tendons in them. (Yes.. after I asked Ashley a second time, she brought some napkins.. silently.. plopped them on the table).  After she took the plates away, she consulted someone and offered us a dessert which we declined. And, we decline to ever return."}
{"text":"It was a last minute late night stop. The bartender greeted us and the waiter, Mike, pretty much made the night. My friend who never eats all her food devoured the chicken lettuce wraps and I ate macaroni and cheese. The food was decent, tried a lime margarita on the rocks, EXCELLENT! overall it was a good experience. It probably helped that our waiter was cute and very very attentive. I'll be back not just because of Mike, but I really want to try their Soba noodles. Oh and we sat next to the kitchen where we could watch food being prepared which I actually enjoyed."}
{"text":"What a bummer. . This used to be one of our families favorite places to go. We hadn't been back for quite some time. & I seriously doubt we'll ever go back. the menu is disjointed. Our spinach dip was runny and lacking flavor. the onion rings were not cooked through so the onions were raw and the breading was doee.  the macaroni and cheese was not edible. we asked for a side of salsa to try to give it some flavor and the salsa was disgusting. French fries were cold and stale. although our server was a nice enough guy he did not offer to comp or trade out any of the food. the only thing we were able to eat were the ribs.  Terribly disappointed."}
{"text":"Walking distance from my house. Busy Friday- Sunday but the rest of the week is a good time to go."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I gave their happy hour a second chance after my not so great prior experience. Glad we did! Food was good, as it was prior ... and this time, the service was much better. She was very aware of the happy hour timing and made sure to get our final orders. Nice intimate happy hour. May be hard to snatch a table during happy hour. Great to go with a group of 4-6. Not room in the bar area for really large parties. Two can easily sit at the bar."}
{"text":"After hearing so many great things about this place I thought I would check it out. The atmosphere is great, the prices are pretty decent but the food is average. You get what you pay for at this place. Average prices for average food. It is a great place to socialize with friends and hang out and have some drinks but don't have high hopes for the food. The service was great though drinks were always refilled, we were checked up on frequently.  I would recommend going here to get together with friends but I wouldn't go here specifically for the \"global\" menu and the rave reviews on how amazing the food is."}
{"text":"The food was amazing as always not sure why I haven't reviewed this location before even though I've been here plenty of times.   This time was very special from the hostess Amani to our server Leza, and the manager JJ (made sure I got there names because they made our evening very nice)! They were very attentive.   I got the happy hour calamari and tempura sushi my wife got the chicken Marsala. Weather was great and So we sat outside. We will back soon!   Thank you everyone!"}
{"text":"I had never been to the elephant bar before my fiancé took my there this past weekend! Happy hour was through the nature restaurant which was a great surprise because a lot of restaurants only serve that in the bar area! We had great service, the food was amazing, and my lemon drop raspberry martini was bomb! This place is great and we will definitely be back! 5 Stars all around!!"}
{"text":"Our waiter Lance was awesome! He recommended this tasty burger and my mouth is still watering! Super helpful and great sense of humor. Went above and beyond to make our dinner a good one"}
{"text":"It's in The District, its got a decent area to catch a game with appetizers or to have a nice dinner. But this time my service was slow even though there was no wait and my section areas were pretty empty. My food was okay ... nothing to write home about. I used to love this place in California but I probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"So they have drastically changed their menu. We still decided to try it out. We had a somewhat large party (7 people). We were told they only had one table that might fit us. We were told all the other tables were reserved no matter how long we waited. Never heard of that but ok. We squished into the table and waited for our waitress. She finally came and took our drink order. After a wait we finally ordered our food. 45 minutes after arriving we still had no food (and they weren't crowded which also didn't make the table debacle any sense). Our food finally came and half of us liked ours the other half not so much. We also had to wait for refills on our drinks. So in the end the service and food were just ok. After the change I doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"My friend and I r regulars here. We always sit at the bar in the bar area. I like the african theme of the decor here. Large animal statues greet u at the front door. We usualy order apps and share them or split an entree. The menu is large with a big variety of options from sushi to hamburgers. There's definitely something for everyone. Of course happy hour is the best time to go since you can save some money."}
{"text":"We have been here about 8 times now. Every time we have a great time. THe menu changes all the time, but always a lot of really good choices.  Last night we ordered the Calamari starter. It was think pieces of cal steak ,lightly breaded and served with shaved bits of carrots and zuchinni. It was very good. For dinner we had A tatse of China ,which was chicken and shrimp with brown rice(excellent) and I had the Burger with Sweet potato Fries, Another home Run.  every time good, we are always happy.  Plus they send out $7.00 coupons all the time. We used one last night as well. Fabulous savings. Clean bathrooms and lots of parking."}
{"text":"I like Elephant Bar and my kids love it.  It is fun, clean and friendly with many food choices so you can take even the pickiest eater there and they will find something they like.  The ambiance is really fun and the drinks, not just wine, are fun too.  Service is always good and they did an amazing job of seating 16 of us one night."}
{"text":"This place was so packed !!! wall to wall tables!!! great service! but if you step out of your booth, you might get ran over by a server!!! Over all , the food and drink was good!!!  Coconut prawns were awesome!"}
{"text":"I only give them three stars because the service is 4 star and the food is 2 stars.   The food by itself isnt horrible. It is horrible when you realize you are eating this at a restaurant.  The food would be good if I opend my freezer and poped the freezer stuff I just bought from costco in the oven.   Basically, I would be shocked if anything was house made. It all tastes like costco freezer food.   When eating there, you cant help but to feel like you are just paying someone to heat up frozen food.   Sapporo gives my that feeling too."}
{"text":"Busy. That's one word that may pop into customers' head when they walk into the Elephant Bar for the first time. At 8:00 p.m. it still feels like the restaurant is at  its dinner peak, but despite this, a friendly host will be at the ready. The waiters were running around like mad; taking a few minutes to check out the enormous menu was not be a problem.  This African-inspired restaurant is mostly known for its Global Grill and Wok Kitchen entrees.  This being said, one option is the Crispy Honey Orange Shrimp from the Wok Kitchen ($12.95). Or opt for a lighter entree, the Japanese Ahi Rice Bowl  ($12.95). Instead of an appetizer split a tasty-looking Jungle Colada ($6.50). Although, what was supposed to be an alcoholic drink turned out to be a thick blend of pineapple and coconut ice cream blended with a bit of strawberry. It was WAY too creamy to taste any alcohol and would have went down better as a dessert than a drink.  The food came soon after and the entrees looked plentiful and fresh. The shrimp was tasty enough with red and green peppers and orange slices but there was nothing \"crispy\" about them. They were more mushy than anything else and the sauce was reminiscent of the syrup kids have on Sunday mornings with their Eggos. The ahi was enjoyable as well as the baked tofu and seaweed salad that came with it.  Overall, there was nothing spectacular about this safari visit. Everything seemed a little too busy and loud (the kitchen was right next to the tables). The service was slow at first, and the Jungle Colada was very disappointing. While the shrimp dish was tasty, there was nothing crispy about it, which made for excellent fryable leftovers.  Three elephants out of five.  One tip for those who haven't already signed up for the Elephant Bar's Passport Email Club is that customers can enroll now for a limited time and receive a $5 reward! This will cover a mini-brownie dessert which only cost $2.95 and has two scoops of vanilla ice cream surrounding a warm brownie!

{"text":"Good food. Good service. Tasty sangria.  For a chain restaurant I was happily surprised with the food here. The lettuce wraps and the jambalaya are my favorites.  I like to try different restaurants....but if i ever run out....I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love elephant bar, have been going here for years... the decor inside reminds me of a something out of a safari, brings a fun element to the dining experience. I got the Cajun chicken dish last time I was in and it was better than ever.Thank you elephant bar for always exceeding expectations."}
{"text":"This AVERAGE review simply is a placeholder for a better review to come along and BUMP it! We have no food to review, because the food we wanted for our Valentine's Day take-away dessert was not available to us! I can't tell you how disappointing it is to finally zero in on what taste we are craving on a holiday, load up the car to first eat mediocre Chinese food at a fast little place so we have money left over for the \"BIG DESSERT IDEA\", drive to Elephant Bar, park the car, and get to the hostess station to order our mud pie......only to be told they've already sold out at 7:15  :( If something's that good, there should be a LOT of it on special days......agreed, yes? I trust the next visit will produce more exciting results. May the force be with the Bar"}
{"text":"This place is always a good place to go for dinner- or a heavy lunch.  I like the Wedge Salad, any Wok dish, or the Miso Yaki Salmon.  Came here on a weekday around 6 pm- no wait, quick service, food was up in a jiffy.  Super good food without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"I remember the first time going into the Elephant Bar and thinking the has to extensive a menu.  For me that is usually a sign that overall the food is not going to be consisten, just to much  of a variety.  My compliments to the chef, I have never had anything that hasn't been quite good.  That is saying something as I over all over the menu.  My dining companion has looked at what at my entree more than once and said \"you are going to eat that?\"  The ambience of the Elephant Bar is rather nice as well.  Not that you don't see the cutoffs and flip flop crowd but it is some place that one can enjoy dressing a bit for a nicer casual dinner.    The only drawback of the Elephant Bar is the service.  As a whole it is usually very good but occasionally you do get a zinger.  To the management's credit, those people usually don't last."}
{"text":"This is one of my family favorites due to wide Asian Californian fusion menu. It today we discovered they changed the menu and some of our favorites are no longer on the menu. It looks half the size of what they offered before.  :("}
{"text":"Yelpers, If you don't read only one review this year, don't read this one; the service was bland, but so was the food - this review can't be much better.  Quick tip, Phoenix in the summer months is not ALWAYS hot, carry a light jacket or sweater in your car, sometimes it's coooold, brrrr. Why some establishments think that 100+ degrees outside means it should be 65- degrees inside is byeond me. We visited on a Saturday before a movie and they seated us just under what seemed to be an ice vent, I was glad I had that sweater in the car.  My first impression of the Elephant Bar was \"What type of food do they serve here?\" Are they Mexi-merican, Italian, American, BBQ, sandwich, Asian Fusion? I'm not sure, and neither does their 30+ page menu. They've got the most confusing menu I've seen from just about any restaurant. I think I saw the same menu item on three separate pages with at least two separate items, why? Don't ask me.  I FINALLY, after about 25 minutes, ordered a barbecue glazed chicken sandwich with the macaroni and cheese side - which they touted all over the menu and table top flyers (the mac n cheese that is). By the way, turns out that their idea of barbecue glazed is a bland piece of chicken with barbecue sauce added after it's put on your sandwich. I could have sworn that barbecue glazed means it's cooked in a fire roaster / oven with the sauce.  I ended up sending the macoroni and cheese back after 4 or 5 bites, the noodles were way over cooked and the cheese was bland, I guess I could have added salt, but didn't really feel like paying for mediocre macoroni. I also requested them to add jalepenos to my chicken sandwich, and they sent out basically an entire jalepeno pepper on the side not peeled, not chopped, not diced, but sliced about 5 times - I ended up cutting it into smaller pieces myself with the butter knife they supplied me so I could actually add it to my sandwich.  The chicken wasn't pink, so I THINK it was cooked, but it was walking the line of cooked and not cooked. After about one fifth of the chicken sandwich I decided the flavor wasn't going to get much better and ended up sending that back also.   The bill arrived and to my surprise the chicken sandwich was still on there. I asked the waitress \"are you really going to charge me for that meal?\". She went and found the manager to which I had to explain again all the reasons I didn't want to eat the food they provided and why I didn't want to order something else instead.  My wife's hambruger was good though. If you're here, hungry, and confused at what to order, get a burger; I think it's the best thing on the menu and difficult to get wrong. Who knows, maybe they can. :-/"}
{"text":"I like this place - a solid option in The District - large and varied menu (a bit too large at times) but a very good happy hour with good burgers, apps and drink specials.  They are welcoming of all types and are friendly and accommodating.  Not the most adventurous (and for those who know me, I am more the adventurous type) but a good option that is guaranteed to have something for everyone and to ultimately please all.  All aboard the Elephant Train!!!"}
{"text":"Update: after reading my review management reached out to offer their apologies and asked for the opportunity to improve our dining experience. What a great way to stand behind your business and ensure your customers happiness really matters. Thank you for taking the time to reach out    I was really disappointed with the food at this location. We had the calamari and the poke and neither tasted remotely close to what it should've tasted like. Calamari steaks were rubbery and bland and fb poke was almost pale pink and flavoeThe service was excellent however the food and drinks were bad enough for me to take that out of my restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"Elephant Bar is my favorite place! Amazing food and menu plus Ive always had great service. No matter who Ive brought to the restaurant, everyone has enjoyed it there.  (Location inside the District is a definite plus.) Chris, a server, is an example of perfect service...setting the bar high for the rest of the wait staff. He even remembers us regulars including our orders/favorites.   5 stars all around....Id give higher if I could."}
{"text":"What a great place! All the food was delicious and plated well. The service staff was friendly and ready to make sure we had a nice dinner out. Family friendly!"}
{"text":"This was a favorite of ours last year. Joined their members club etc. Called them today to see if patio was open for seating..yes. Over we went...greeter pointed us to patio door 'any seating is fine' we were told. 15 minutes later...no server, no menu, no acknowledgement that we were there. No more...no chance..good luck!"}
{"text":"I know this is a chain, but sometimes it just sounded so good.  The food was always great and fast and we enjoyed the atmosphere.  My only complaint is what you get for the price.  If it was a little cheaper I would give 5 stars."}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour, I love the atmosphere here. I strayed from the normal pub burger and had the orange chicken but it didn't cut the mustard so I opted for the steak..I also had the mac n cheese and it was delicious..nice little spot to step away from the normal happy hour"}
{"text":"I always feel a little underdressed no matter what I'm wearing when I go into an Elephant Bar... doesn't matter what location and this location isn't any different.  The sharp decor of the Elephant Bar franchise is definitely appealing to the inner girl.  What girl doesn't want to eat in a place who has painted gold trim, old style wallpaper, old trunks as a decor quirk, with wrought iron blown glass lighting?  I have to say I like the layout of this location the best though.  I like that I can see through the restaurant and I don't feel like I'm going to get lost.  Sat down with my family in a nice window lit booth and the noise was up but down.  I didn't have to yell or anything... I perfectly heard the people across the table.  Service was great.  The server was right there, serving drinks and was right up to get our orders when everybody got there.  I ordered the new Pacific Cove Tropical Crab and Shrimp Louie.  The picture in the menu just looked scrumptious and so when that plate showed up looking just like the picture, I was totally drooling.  It was excellent.  The mix of mangos and tomatos and crab and shrimp and avocado and cucumber with the Louie dressing... mmmmmuah!  Yum.  And I didn't leave feeling a heavy full or anything like that, but I wasn't aching for dessert either.  I would say ya'll should try it.  Even though it is a chain. :)"}
{"text":"Great Waiter & Bartender! There was a big menu full of stuff-- some it had too much of the same ingredients but it turned out to be a flavorful and yummy experience. The staff makes the place better than it really is, and it seems to bring in a large crowd on the weekends."}
{"text":"Good food when it's slow. Not so good when super busy. This is usually a great place to stop after watcning a show at the Harkins theater nearby. If the lot is full on a Friday or Sat night I would pass and go somewhere a little less overwhelmed. Although the service there has always been pretty good for us, the food is hit and miss."}
{"text":"I just don't get the mediocre reviews of this place.  Yes, it's a chain, but it's a unique one at that.  I've never had a bad meal here.  I generally stick with the asian entrees and have never been disappointed.  This lunch was especially good and the service was excellent.  We ordered:  - Thai-High Sweet & Zesty Chicken Salad - delicious - Wok Fired Sesame Ginger Chicken (noodles) - fabulous & a large portion - Side order of fries - seriously some of the best I had w/ both sea salt and pepper and perfectly fried  Overall, a great lunch....I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Most of the food here is adequate, but that's about all I can say.  The service is okay, but not great.  The wait staff is generally nice, but not friendly, and not very quick.  I can say that I was VERY dissapointed by their idea of \"bruschetta\".  I refused to eat it.  It was pita bread, cold tomatoes, slabs of mozzerella cheese, and avocado.  Awful."}
{"text":"Dude... totally try the Sweet and Sour Shrimp.  I couldn't believe how good that was.  And it wasn't even my plate. (Thanks Grandmother)  Service was not bad... I like Elephant Bar's menu anyway.  It just sits right.  The only issue is that it took FOREVER to get our check paid and done.  Everything else was so fast an in our face, then suddenly to slow down to almost nothing to wait for the check to be paid... ugh."}
{"text":"I went for lunch by myself the other day because it's within walking distance from my work, I wanted to shake up my routine, and I had heard that they had a decent happy hour. From the outside it appeared empty but the bar had some customers. Happy hour starts at 3 and it was just that when I arrived. I sat at the bar and ordered a strawberry lemonade that the bartender suggested. Holy sugar overload!! It was tongue-smackingly sweet. I had to switch to iced tea.   I wasn't really impressed by the happy hour menu. Most of the things on it were for sharing so I wound up simply ordering the shrimp fresh (vietnamese) spring roll from that menu. The spring roll was pretty bland even after I asked for some sriracha. What was good was the asian slaw/salad it was served with. It had cabbage, cucumbers, sesame seeds, red peppers, celery and was dressed in what tasted like rice wine vineagar and oil maybe? I dunno but I liked it. They can make good stuff- they should try harder to put it out there!"}
{"text":"I hate to leave a low rating without reviewing the food, but our experience was so terrible that I just had to. My husband asked about the Macadamia Encrusted Chicken, and verified that there were no peanuts in the dish because he's deathly allergic to peanuts.  The waiter confirmed that they only used macadamia nuts.  After a few bites, my husband started going into anaphylactic shock, and we inspected the dish and found peanuts.  While he was trying to vomit, I notified the manager and got his contact info.  After the whole ordeal, and our trip to the ER, the manager said that the 'new guy' in the kitchen told him that they were out of macadamia nuts that night, so he just used peanuts instead.  :| To be fair, the place seemed pretty nice, the menu was diverse, and the management was friendly and helpful.  However, the threat of accidental death due to negligence ensures that we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Service is so slow and the food quality not worth the wait.  First timer and wasn't impressed"}
{"text":"I don't come here that often but when I do the service and food have always been great! On this visit I tried the Pineapple chipotle margarita which was amazing, I highly recommend this drink!!  I ordered the Nachos with chicken, as well as the Hawaiian Ahi Tuna, both on the Appetizer menu.  The serving for the Nachos was generous, but my only critique will be how dry the chicken was. The Ahi tuna was amazing just needed extra parmesan chips which we got upon request.  The Happy hour pricing is only available at the Bar area, FYI.  I was very impressed with the attentiveness of our server, I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Mother's day lunch at the Elephant Bar. I had a great salad, the Thai High oriental salad with the Salmon roll appetizer, served non-tempera, delicious. Food was wonderful, service just right, not too hovering, just enough, very attentive. Split the salad and still was too full to eat dessert. Busy but nice energy, not too noisy for afternoon. Love the giant elephant fountain in the entry. Really great."}
{"text":"The environment was cool, service friendly. The food would probably be good if it had been delivered promptly (I'm assuming it wasn't). My husbands Mongolian beef was overcooked and lukewarm at best. My Mahi Mahi was cooked nicely but also seemed to have been sitting out for awhile before arriving at the table. We will possibly come again but maybe when their slower or for a lunch."}
{"text":"This my first time here.  The menu looks good.  Not crowed but it's only 4:45 p Here to meet the gang  about 10 of us meet about 1-2 a month.  We asked for a round table so we could all see each other instead of screaming down to the end of the table.  They did not have one.  Dinner was okay not great.  Here is the kicker about a week after we had our dinner here the restaurant was gone, not just closed but gone."}
{"text":"Compared to other Elephant Bars, this was barely 3 stars. Our server was absolutely fantastic but the food was very bland to me. My mom sent back her lunch & was okay with getting something from somewhere else later but our server insisted on getting here something else. She LOVED her second dish which was Mongolian Beef. I had the Marsala Chicken. It was a lot pricer than I remember, or it could just be more expensive in this area but with a tip, 2 lunches & 1 iced tea it was $35. I won't be rushing back here soon."}
{"text":"This place has been my favorite since I was very young for one reason - I've NEVER had a bad experience here! I love this places atmosphere, different style entrees & the waitresses are always in a great mood & super helpful. This past experience we had Danielle as our server who was full of smiles, very informative, fast paced yet still gave the best customer service (which is my fave! lol) Overrall, yet another amazing experience at the Elephant Bar :) plus, check in on yelp & get a free desert!!!"}
{"text":"The wife and I have been coming to the Elephant Bar for years. Always great fast service and the food is superb with a variety that could satisfy even the pickiest.   The shrimp and chicken jumbalaya are very good as well as the crispy honey shrimp, one of my personal faves. I have also enjoyed the kung pao chicken, (not too spicy) but amaze balls. Don't forget to save room for dessert as they have a nice selection.   Happy hour is also great if your coming by after work with friends or stopping by the bar before a movie at Green Valley Ranch. Centrally located in Green Valley with plenty of parking. 4/5  stars overall and two thumbs up from us!!"}
{"text":"We came in with a coupon and our waitress was. Super nice. The food was really good. I can't wait to go again. It's nice to take a walk in the shopping area afterwards. Kinda romantic!"}
{"text":"The menu is a huge hodge podge of different things.  Variety is nice but this seems a bit random.  Maybe if they specialized a little more they could do some fine tuning on the food.  The Tempura Salmon Roll appetizer was... different.  We liked that the whole thing is tempura-fried but the cooked salmon didn't taste right in a sushi roll.  The wedge salad was delicious.  The Tropical Citrus side salad was pretty large for a side salad.  It was okay but nothing too exciting.    The Bankok Stir Fried Pad Thai with Vegetables & Tofu was a bit of a disappointment.  Do they use regular linguine noodles and drown the whole thing in soy/teriyaki-type sauce in Bankok?   I have my doubts, but if so, Elephant Bar nailed it!  I also tasted the fish and chips.  The fish sticks looked like mozzarella sticks and seemed a bit tough/dry.  The sweet potato fries were decent but slightly mushy and not really seasoned.  The service was okay but someone needs to tell the waiter that it's impolite to reach directly across someone's face when delivering food or drinks.  He did that several times, which was really irritating."}
{"text":"I visited this location a few weeks ago. Affordable, good quality food. Large portions too. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I give everyone multiple chances at being nice, but something was bothering the hostess every time I have gone. Luckily, the only time I had to deal with her was as I was being seated. The Waiters that dealt with me were much more friendly.  What knocked my rating down to 3 stars was the speed of service. I waited about 20 minutes to get my drink and then another hour to get my food. I understand that sometimes a place is rocking and that the cooks make food based on when it was ordered, but the place only had like 10 people in it, and all of them had their food already when I had arrived.   The saving grace of this place was that the food pleased my taste buds nicely. I had some of the Parmesan crusted green beans and wow, were they good.They come with a nice little dipping sauce of some kind that really tops them off nicely.  Next I had the Shrimp and Chicken Jambalaya. The huge thing that got me here was that it was chicken Jambalaya, which I LOVED. I've been searching for a place that doesn't have pork or beef in their Jambalaya and have came up empty on most counts. Definitely something to check out if you don't eat red meat.  Prices were fair, nothing to write home about though.  Food was great, service was mediocre at best, and prices were decent. Maybe a place to check out, but I wouldn't come here often."}
{"text":"not happy at all with the new menu. everything we came here for was removed from the menu and it is on this huge piece of wood. we also had a terrible server and she only had 3 tables of people. we used to recommend thiz place often but not anymore. we will not be back Anytime soon. I'm sad this used to be a go to for date night."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since we met friends there so we decided to go back for a family birthday celebration. What happened to the menu!? I'm the only vegetarian in the group, but really, only one option now, and that's a Gardenburger I can buy at any grocer? Where's the pad thai I loved? The great salads? The waitress points out I can get tofu in place of meat, but $13 for tofu in orange sauce with rice? So I ordered 3 sides. The side salad was a disappointing iceberg lettuce with shredded cheese and a few chunks of watery tomatoes.The mixed vegetables mixed nearly raw carrot slices and steamed squash. OK, the mac and cheese was a yummy indulgence of calories without nutritional benefit. I'll give points to the Asti Moscato and the wonton sundae for the birthday person. Otherwise ... meh."}
{"text":"Our personal favorite in south Vegas... So yummy. Sushi, sweet and sour chicken, salads, prawns... Great variety of food."}
{"text":"I usually don't review larger chains but I absolutely love Elephant Bar. Never had bad service there, they have a ton of options and their happy hour is fantastic. Drinks are good, great selection of beers and spirits. For food, you HAVE to get the calamari to start. It's unlike any other place and it's so delicious. The teriyaki chicken is great, lemon chicken is outstanding and the prices aren't too bad either. There are very few places like Elephant Bar and this location is the best one.   -Ethan"}
{"text":"This is a chain that definitely deserves to be shunned and avoided like the plague.  I went there for the first time for a birthday dinner for my Mom which was decided on because it supposedly had a fun atmosphere and had a diverse menu. I had high hopes when I walked in because I did dig the interior design and our comfy booth. But the bizzare pacific rim/sandwiches/seafood/steakhouse menu doesn't match its East African/Elephant theme at all.  I tried a shrimp adventure platter which boasted some coconut, Teriyaki, and fried shrimp. The coconut and fried shrimp were far worse then even what you get at Red Lobster or Trader Joe's. The coconut were completely flavorless and a huge disappointment. My Teriyaki shrimp came out cold and I had to get them re-done. The dipping sauces where pretty much Kroger-brand quality.  Worse, is that the food made me and most of the other people in my party queezy afterward. Had to take some acidophilus to calm our stomachs down.  We also had pretty much every bad service experience one could have. We ordered an appetizer which they brought out two minutes before our food was ready, they forgot to make one of our entrees, part of my entree was cold, waitress left us without beverages for long stretches, waitress asked us if we wanted desert multiple times, waitress rang our bill up wrong.  In short, terrible Grocery store food packaged well and served to you for 15 dollars a plate."}
{"text":"I was THRILLED by the happy hour prices and food.  Had the mojitos and the bruschetta dish.  Can't wait to go back and have it again.  Big chunks of fresh mozzarella, avocado and then a chopped up tomato, basil mixture.... served with pita chips.  YUMMY!  I have to say the service (young blonde girl working the bar area alone) SUCKED.  Good thing the food and drinks were so good."}
{"text":"I was not overly excited to eat here because this is just another chain with 'eh' food.  This was my second trip to this place, but will probably be my last because there are just too many good restaurants in the area to waste time eating at run-of-the-mill places like Elephant Bar.  I agree with most of the other reviews that there really is no common theme for the food.  You would think that it is going to be 'jungle' or 'island' themed, but I was at a loss as to what they were actually going for.  The decor is unique and is jungle themed, but the menu was random.  From potato skins and calamari to ribs and coconut fried shrimp; this was more of a more expensive Applebee's than anything else.  I also agree with most of the other reviews on here about the food.  The portions and prices are almost reasonable, but the quality just isn't there.  I ordered the burger and it was clearly from a package and frozen just a few hours before.  The sweet potato fries were ok at best and really nothing special.  Neither were the calamari, nachos, ribs, or tri-tip I tasted.  I agree that all the food may very well have been from Costco.  I have nothing bad to say about the service.  Our waiters were very friendly, helpful and quick and there were no major issues with our party of 9."}
{"text":"I had planned on eating at Rachel's Kitchen for lunch but when I saw it was obnoxiously busy, I wandered over to Elephant Bar Restaurant to eat instead. I'm so glad I did! The decor is super cute and right up my alley. I love animal print and safari-style anything, so I was totally in cheetah heaven!   I ordered the Cajun Chicken from their Lighter Side menu. It came with a full cup of rice mixed with spicy sausage. The seasoning on the chicken was perfect-- flavorful but not burn-your-face-off hot. Just how I like it!   Our server Brandon was very friendly and didn't mind that my colleague and I lingered at the table for more than 20 minutes after we finished dining. I don't spend much time at The District, but I may make a special trip just for Elephant Bar!"}
{"text":"Me and Ellen F. came with a mutual friend who is a huge fan of this place, he says nothing but good things about it. The name itself jarred my curiosity, the Elephant Bar. We came at 11:30 so the place wasn't crowded at all, the host seated us right away in the back booth. Elephant Bar has an open kitchen in the back so you can see the staff prepare your food, which I don't mind.   The decor IMO was appealing and comfortable. It's a safari type theme yet very modern, old school advertisements for Africa and warm wood colored tones. When we walked in I caught a glimpse of the bar, it was circular surrounded by clear shadeless windows on all sides. The bar definitely looks like a chill drink spot, going to have to check it out sometime.  I ordered the Chicken & Shrimp Jambalaya, for $2 extra I opted for the bourbon rice instead of the white or brown option, I'm a sucker like that. To start me and Ellen F. split the chicken tortilla soup. The waitress was awesome, she actually split it up into two bowels instead of one which is a bitch to share with someone. The soup was luke warm, I like my soup hot. Although the soup was not the temperature I liked it did taste really good. Wasn't to spicy had the right amount of zest to it.  The Jambalaya was just OK, nothing real special. The rice was worth the extra $2 though. The sauce tasted like it came out of a plastic bag along with the chicken. I think it got left under the heat lamp for to long as it had that dry film-like coating starting to form on top. The quantity was definitely enough as I was full when I finished it, the lunch portion definitely would not have done the job, so if your hungry get the dinner size for $15.99.   Overall I expected a lot more as far as quality of food, the prices are up there and the ambience definitely gives it that fine dining vibe. If I come by again it won't be by my choice unless its for the bar area. On a positive note the service was great, my water never got low and she actually brought lemons with the water without me asking, she was super friendly and genuinely made us feel welcomed."}
{"text":"The Olive Garden of Asian/Thai food.   The location was nicely decorated with an African theme and very clean.  We enjoyed the great happy hour drink specials before dinner.   The dinner was acceptable, but nothing to write home about.   Our service at the bar and at the table was very quick and the servers were pleasant and smiling which always make dinner a better experience.  I would give it four stars but this dining room was so huge and so busy that it really seemed like an Olive Garden and I don't believe the meals can be made properly when there's seating for 450 people."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about this place but I've never loved it.  Went in Saturday after a movie and expected it to be packed.  It wasn't - immediate seating and we sat there till almost closing with lots of empty tables around us - I get the feeling they aren't doing well.  I ordered 2 drinks and didn't care for either.  The strawberry mule had chunks of fruit in it which I don't like.  Nothing worse than sucking chunks through your straw and gagging at every sip.  The martini was straight booze, and not in a good way.  I added ice and water till the very end and the drink never got better.     My friend liked her tacos and her moscato.  I liked my chicken marsala.  All in all it wasn't terrible but it wasn't great either.  Not a place I would choose to come regularly, just went cause it was convenient."}
{"text":"Very very good service!  Excellent food, drink, and ambiance!  This is my first time and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I went to the Elephant Bar several years ago and had a wonderful experience. This time, not so much. My friends and i decided to sit at the bar, where it was mostly quiet for a Sunday evening. Though the bartender was friendly and attentive, the food I had was meh. The Mac and cheese I had was excellent but the tuna salad I had was not good. The fish was very rubbery and the salad was almost tasteless. After my most recent visit, I am probably not gonna return to the Elephant Bar in the future. They get an extra star for the free dessert we received upon checking in from the Yelp app."}
{"text":"Being new to the area we tried this place on Saturday night. We were seated relatively quickly by friendly staff and asked to sit outside. The place is situated just off the main casino entrance and sitting outside was lovey and quiet.   We opted for two ales, a Rebel IPA and a Blue moon, both were very good.   I had the Orange Peel Chicken and my wife had the Pot Toast, both were great.   The service was nice and quick and a lovely friendly atmosphere.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Kayleigh is amazing!! If we come back it will be for her only! Her menu knowledge is endless and her recommendations are on point ! GIVE THIS LADY A RAISE!!"}
{"text":"Danielle, our waitress, did a good job!! She took great care of us. The food was great and drinks were good too! Parking was kind of a hassle. It's in a really cute location but it would be nice if there is more parking, like a parking garage."}
{"text":"We had sometime to kill before our movie started so decided to get couple drinks & appetizers before our movie. We got couple drinks $4 wells we tried the apps off their happy hour menu. We got the tempera salmon roll,potato skins great by the way, chicken tenders, & artichoke dip with bruschetta everything tasted very good. Our waiter was very friendly & quick to get our order & food. Great service. Recommend this location."}
{"text":"Food is okay.  i can't really pick a dish thats really good. Love the desserts though. Huge mud pies, cookie ice creams...nom nom nom!   Love that there's brown rice and a lot of veggies with dishes.  I mainly come here for HAPPY HOUR!  Pretty good array of drinks (huge tall glass of long island = 0)  , and lots of choices for food.    http://www.elephantbar.com/HappyHour/HappyHour.aspx  The one thing I don't  like was the Vietnamese Fresh rolls.  The 1st it was ok.  The 2nd time was horrible.  It was loosely wrapped, noddles galore that was a little hard.  Sure ly not doing that again. YUCK."}
{"text":"TL;DR the food is good, but good luck getting it in a reasonable time or right the first time  Met my wife and a friend here for happy hour.  They started out by mixing up my wife's and friends wine.  We asked for water when we ordered drinks. Maybe 5 minutes later we see our server bring water to a table that just sat down.  Then about 5 minutes later when our server walks by our table we ask again for water. She said 'oh yeah I brought the other table your water\".  After some time she comes back with 2 waters. I have to remind her we wanted one for each of us.  They gave me the wrong beer, not a big deal, but had to go to the  bar our server was gone. And even then it took quite awhile and a nearly empty bar to get help.  My food order was wrong the first two times they brought it out. Finally just took it because I didn't think they would be any more likely to get it correct.  They also didn't bring silverware/napkin out so I had to flag them done again and wait awhile.  We had to flag them down later to get the check. The check had an item we hadn't ordered on it.  And when I asked the server about it she said 'I told my manager about that he said he'd fix it'.  They did happily fix it and told me next time the service would be on point.  There are so many great options at the district and green valley ranch than here"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a long time. The service was excellent as food came efficiently and the waitress was on top of drinks and customer service. We were joking a lot though and I'm not sure she knew what to make of it lol.... East coast humor...the hostess also was very nice and we even shared a good laugh. The food was average. I got the shrimp and chicken wok stir fry with brown rice and it had a nice kick but overwhelming sauce compared to the balance of veggies and protein. He got the teryiaki chicken and it didn't look like your typical teryiaki chicken and must not have been too bad as he finished it all.  The atmosphere is nice as its dim and the tables aren't on top of each other. The dining area doesn't hear the noise at the bar either which is nice. We didn't do dessert or anything so it was quite simple and the best part of the evening was the company."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. I had to wave down the my waiter  which he probably didn't see anyway because he was too busy flirting with the hostess. The entire time we needed more water for my table, our glasses were empty the majority of the time we were there. I said yes we would like dessert and he left and talked to the hostess again and then just brought my bill.  When clearly I said yes we would like dessert.  He waited on another table alongside us more frequently and they came after us and left before us because they got served better. I am a foodie and love to try new places.  I was recommended to come here by my coworker.  And I must say,  I am not impressed by the service. The one star is for the great food.  But I believe any food can taste great with great service. I made reservations and my party felt ignored the entire time.  Also, it doesn't help that today is my BIRTHDAY. What a bummer!  Maybe I'll return.  Not any time soon.  Just for the food.  Not for the service. I have a huge balloon and gifts by me.  Clearly...  It's my birthday.  Just saying.   I have added 2 more stars after posting this one because my friend spoke to the manager while I was at the restroom and they apologized and comped our entire meal.  I may be returning in the future."}
{"text":"Waitress was so nice and efficient.We always had full drinks,she answered all of our questions since it was my first time.My fiance had been months before.He ordered the ribs,i ordered the macadamia nut fish.We thought it was odd that our food came so quickly(less than 20 mins) his full rack of ribs was like room temperature! gross! Being ribs,its known that theres going to be fat on them, but it was like no one even tries to clean the meat up before coi.king it.My fish wasnt bad, but nothin special. None the less, i do not recommend this place. Unless you want to pay decent money, you could spend across the street at p.f. changs (like we should have)"}
{"text":"This was my second trip here in less than a month. Service the first time ( serve was Will) was exceptional. Was there with a holiday party group and he kept all of us straight and never let a glass go dry. Food was also very good. The homemade chicken tortilla soup is outstanding. It tastes like it was just made. I paired that with the organic greens salad. I asked for the salad with the dressing on the side. The soup and salad arrived at the same time. I started on the soup and did not really look at the salad. Our waiter checked on us and then was back in a few minutes with a (new) salad. He had noticed that the dressing was on the salad before I did. Very nice move! We will return"}
{"text":"Summary: Not seated, not waited on, had to take menus off of another table. (And the place was practically empty) After 15-20 minutes finally we just left, hungry, no one even tried to serve us!  My Experience: I walked in alone with my 14 month old daughter at around 9:20pm. Just as we were walking in I saw someone leave the hostess area. In the restaurant area had only 2-3 tables of people... the bar area had about 10 people the place was near deserted. So I waited... had my daughter walk around the reception area... had her look at the elephant... the giraffes.... the plants... a waitress walks by and smiles at her... nobody even talks to us or tries to seat us. At least two of the waitresses saw us. I finally asked the waitress if I can sit in the bar area with a child for happy hour, she happily says \"Yes, and you can sit in the lower tables just outside so she won't fall\". Nobody comes. I grab a happy hour menu from the bar... waitresses see us... try to grab a full menu from the hostess desk and give up because they are under the desk. Wait and have the waitress look right at me but not say anything to me at all. My daughter started to fuss and I just gave up and walked out! 15-20 minutes. I have been to Elephant Bars many times and loved every experience, but this location was absolutely ridiculous.   I am giving them 2 stars for the benefit of a doubt that the hostess was on break and because the waitress spoke nicely to me."}
{"text":"Overall experience was ok but nothing special. The food lack the wow factor and made me second guess choosing this location. Being a Las Vegas local we have many options and for $60 bill for 2 people several of the other option would be better. It took forever to get the food and we literally left most on the plate. Not very happy with the quality nor overall experience."}
{"text":"Amazing service, even with it being my server's final day.. With the fact it was the 7pm on the Friday before Christmas, my order came out rather quickly.. Loved the tall glass of beer, but the dinner portions for the Korean Chicken & Kona Ribs could have been a bit bigger for the price. Loved the Apple Blueberry Walnut Cobbler..!"}
{"text":"This place deserves five stars but they took the lamb shank off the menu. One star until they bring it back"}
{"text":"It was the night after a movie screening, we decided to talk more and have a bite. He must be a regular there - hmmm??? He said he's a movie buff.  Anyway, the staff knew him.  I had a craving for their Cadillac Margarita, if it's as yummy as The Elephant Bar & Grill in San Diego and yes, same company.  Another favorite is the Quick Seared Ahi Tuna Salad slightly different in a sense that it had seaweed in the salad - heaven to the lips and perfect for satiety.  It's a plus for me when I can maintain eating healthy while dining out... We sat at the surrounding bar area - high table/arm-stool seating. They are located outside theater section outside Green Valley Casino.  Fun staff!  Very attentive and seemed interested in making sure our food was exactly the way we liked it.  I had a little taste of his Spicy Singapore noodles w Shrimp - the noodles were slightly crisp but full of flavor. I'm still not sure if it was my ravishing beauty that got all the attention or maybe he's just a nice guy??? No drama I promise.  Had fun till it was closing time (midnight).  Lots of parking.  There's TV.  Great ambience for hangin' out in the evenings. Full Bar. I would definitely take my friends there - sort of away from the maddening strip crowd with access to the casino, shopping & movies."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Good service. Wok meal had too much Soy sauce. Pot Stickers very good. We'll come back."}
{"text":"I totally don't get this place.  Awful \"hits\" menu and terrible too-loud top 40 hits playing on the stereo system.  I was attempting to enjoy dinner with co-workers but the environment was just too loud, too visually busy and had a similar vibe to the Indiana Jones ride/Jungle Cruise section of Disneyland.  To their credit, the white sangria thing was fairly decent.  Service is good and attentive."}
{"text":"Always love coming to Elephant Bar when we're in town. Chelsea is hands down the best!"}
{"text":"We always get good service here. The menu has lots of choices. It's a casual ambience. My favorite dish is the Coconut Shrimp. I didn't care for the Baked Spinach and Tortilla appetizer. It lacked flavor and tasted like spinach that was cooked in a creme sauce, not a good consistency. The lettuce wraps come with two sauces that are mouth watering out of this world! One is a peanut sauce, the other a sweet cilantro sauce. My son who is 8 loved the kids chicken tender strips. The breading on them is very crunchy and delicious he said. My husband ordered the tortilla soup, not too spicy for him, and the chicken marinara dish. He said it was O.K. which means it was nothing to rave about. This is a good restaurant to try in the district."}
{"text":"Great happy hour, not busy at all.  Family friendly, all kinds of food and drink on the menu, and quality food at that.  Great alternative to other chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Not so good!!.......Recent visit was average...at best. My wifes chicken was undercooked, and the server questioned my wife on what was considered \"undercooked\".....took forever to get a replacement dish. My fish was also slightly undercooked. Quality of food was not worth the price. This place needs to raise it standards!"}
{"text":"Wow yes, quite a difference huh? Went back here with the hubby and sister and brother in law. Discovered that they took my beloved honey mustard chicken salad off the menu. WTF? Why does this always happen to me??? In any event, I ordered the new shrimp and crab Louis salad with a side of sweet pot fries and a raspberry mango swirl smoothie or something to that effect. The salad kinda sucked. Not enough shrimp or crab, plus I hate how everything was \"sectioned.\" Just mix everything in my salad together and then top with huge mounds of shrimp and crab! The sweet pot fries were not very good this time and a waste I felt. The smoothie was ok but not as good as the strawberry banana one. The rest of our party didn't care for their entrees very much either. Oh and their \"home made\" mac and cheese was terrible. Not creamy, not cheesy, and their \"breadcrumbs\" were nothing more than croutons! Not the same thing! Anyways, service was still ok but their food has gone downhill I think. It went from being terrific to just ok for me. Don't think i will go back unless someone else suggest it. Major disappointment.   :("}
{"text":"This review is for the bar- our bartenders Maria and Lisa are the reason we keep coming back. My boyfriend and I came about 2 months ago and struck up a conversation with Maria while she made our drinks. Not only were the drinks phenomenal but we left feeling like we had just talked to a friend. We same back tonight to celebrate our engagement and she remembered us from the previous encounter and noticed the ring that had not been there last time- something even my coworkers had not noticed. Any bar can make tasty drinks, but it takes somewhere special to make an experience. Thank you Maria and Lisa for making our experience!"}
{"text":"Me and my family have been here more than once. We enjoy the food and ambiance of the restaurant. Unfortunately last night had given us some issues. My brother had diarrhea all night and began to puke through out the night as well. I woke up with nasty feeling and threw up as well. My mother had also woken up by throwing up. The service was amazing but I guess the food might have had something it."}
{"text":"Elephant Bar is an awesome place and our server was Edgar and he was amazing ! Overall wonderful service :)"}
{"text":"Danielle was absolutely fantastic As a server! Came back to check if everything was okay. Definitely a Attribute to our he elephant bar!"}
{"text":"A poor version of Cheesecake Factory (and I don't like Cheesecake Factory - big menu with lots of stuff from all persuasions, none of it rendered well - this place is similar but rendered even less well.)  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Come here specifically for the E cookie!!!!! So yummy, warm and sweet!! You get to choose reg or white chocilate macadamia nut  best desert nearby!"}
{"text":"Great location to grab some food after being in the movie theater with friends (since it's close by).   The food was delicious and the service was great. The only thing that bothers me is they sent me a medium rare when I asked for my \"AHi\" to be rare. But in the end I enjoyed my food so no biggy :D I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Food was good. Management was good. But bar tender VANESSA was AMAZING!!! We had a terrible experience with our server Catallina until Vanessa took control and took over our table. She was amazing! She served us more than our original server Catallina did. Our first server was horrid. She had a horrible nasty attitude. She took forever to greet us. She made rude comments about our orders. She forgot to bring our food until after she brought out or steaks! When we asked for oranges for our drinks she didn't bring them till after the fabulous Vanessa brought us some. Catallina brought our oranges out in a napkin! So disgusting. Catallina may have been some of the worst service I have ever experienced. If it weren't for the management and the truly amazing Vanessa I would never come back. Vanessa turned this from one of the worst dining experiences to one of the best! GO SEE VANESSA!!!"}
{"text":"The menu is probably the best thing about this place. There are so many choices from which to decide! We're not steak and potatoes types, so having such a variety of seafood, vegetarian, and chicken dishes is awesome. Mostly Asian inspired, the menu also features a variety of burgers, sandwiches, salads, steaks, and at least one lamb dish. I really enjoyed my Salmon Roll and Macau Shrimp and Noodle Soup Combo ($9.95) which had 6 delicious sushi-type rolls and 8 oz bowl of soup chunky enough to nosh with chopsticks. It came with gari & a healthy pat of hot wasabi. My husband loved his Szechwan Shrimp & Chicken in Spiced Garlic Sauce  ($11.95). Our business acquaintence ordered Orange Chicken  ($12.25) that he likes so much he orders it every time.  Service was great. There was a small variety of beers on tap. Chopsticks right on the table. My only beef was that the pre-wrapped silverwear had chunks of food still stuck to it, and the napkin is too flimsy to serve as a lap napkin or to wipe the soup off your face.  All in all, the great variety on the menu, good service, tasty food, unique atmosphere,  and moderate prices make this a solid choice for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Always a solid staple for me & the wife when in the area. Consistently good service, a wide enough selection on the menu and this last visit we were lucky enough to shave a few bucks off the tab by hitting during happy hour for discounted cocktails - and we do like our cocktails!    Used to live close by this location but have since moved to other side of town. Still get the same experience today when in the neighborhood that I did back when I lived nearby - a very good meal at reasonable prices with friendly and quick service.  Nothing so spectacular that it deserves five stars, but a solid four is well earned every time we go.  Looking forward to next time!"}
{"text":"Meh.  We came here with some awesome friends of ours this afternoon after taking in Captain America: Civil War (great flick , btw). It's actually pretty easy to find in the Village Walk at The District at Green Valley Ranch. Just park near all the real estate offices and start walking towards the Green Valley Ranch Casino and just before you approach the casino it will be on your right.  (+) Decor was very unique and very cool! Lots of little details to the place, which is much bigger inside than it appeared from the outside. (+) Restaurant was very clean and organized. (+) Sangria was very tasty and enjoyable! (+) Chicken Tortilla soup was very tasty, with a little kick to it! Salad was okay and portion size was pleasing.  (-) Service was hit and miss. The young lady who served us was very busy and missed bringing several items to our table, including a side of garlic mashed potatoes. Then it took for-ev-er to get our desert and then our bill later. She was very nice though. Like I said, maybe she felt a bit overwhelmed. (-) teriyaki chicken rice was so-so at best. Tasted way too salty. Makes me wonder if they use MSG.  I do also like the fact that they post the calorie count of all of their menu items. Makes it much easier to track, if you're into that sort of thing.  I don't know. I just wasn't too impressed with this place to justify a return visit. The service was so-so and the food, while not terrible, wasn't good enough to impress me.  2 stars.  Meh. I've experienced better."}
{"text":"Visited here on a Monday. The place was practically empty and we received very good service. The atmosphere made us feel like we were on an African Safari. The food was very good as well. I ordered the garlic chicken Alfredo while my girlfriend ordered the lettuce chicken wrap. The chicken wrap included two sauces, one of which was pretty spicy so watch out! Over all it was a very good experience and I would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Tried a bunch of happy hour items. Definitely lacking. Greasy and cheap tasting.   Service was not good. Waiter forgot a beer. Food took 30 minutes to come out.   Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Salmon with rice and vegi is a must have. If I could eat there every night, I would."}
{"text":"Our server Ashley was very nice and attentive. However, the menu was a bit all over the place and it felt like the restaurant hasn't quite decided what their identity is or what they want to be known for. My wife said that she read somewhere that it's supposedly a scratch kitchen but the food, while good enough, was only average. It presented well and was a good portion size but nothing that was necessarily impressive."}
{"text":"Always great for kids. Using the mail coupons is a very cost saving option. Happy hours also lend great prices.  I have to say, even though it is a chain, the food has always been tasty. We've eaten here probably 10-15 times. As a good standby item that's inexpensive and fast, the coconut shrimp appetizer is pretty spot on. For something heavier, the lamb shank is also a win.   I gave it only 4 stars because the service always leaves something to be desired. It's not the servers per se, but we have had to wait for a table sometimes when there was no one waiting, and plenty of tables open. Also have seen management staff speaking unprofessionally at times to other staff, within earshot of patrons."}
{"text":"It's about time I review the Elephant Bar. This place is reasonably priced and has excellent food. I love their Wok Kitchen creations. Who would have thunked it, but the Elephant Bar has the best Chinese food around. As many times as I contemplate trying something different, I always default back to the Shanghai Cashew Chicken ($11.75). The portion is huge and served with white or brown rice. My wife usually devours the Kung Pao Shrimp.   Their happy hour food is reasonably priced, I recommend the Sliders. They have plenty of TV's to catch the game. Although service in the bar area can be unpredictible, the restaurant service is always excellent. Be prepared for the crowds on the weekend."}
{"text":"The menu could be expanded more but the service was great. Was the only place in Vegas not crowded for dinner on a Sunday evening."}
{"text":"The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results.  So call me crazy because I continue to give this place a chance after it has been proven over and OVER again that they most certainly do NOT deserve it!  I remember a time, in the not so distant past, when Elephant Bar was new and had a great menu and good people serving their clientele.  A time that will forever remain in the past as NOW their customer service is horrible, their overpriced menu is bland and boring and the clientele is slowly learning that a dining experience as they're likely to get here now belongs, at best, at the old Ed DeBevics!  I had to actually get up after a 15 minute wait to ask who our server was.  After thanking the hostess for that information I asked if it would be possible to actually MEET said server as we had been sitting for a quarter of an hour without that distinct honor.  45 minutes after being seated saw us to our actual food...missing some key ingredients I might add!  Apparently there was a shortage of iced tea that particular evening because there were no refreshings-of-beverages for us!  Oh...and if you're going to roll your eyes at me, dear waitress, for saying to you that \"yes, we WOULD still like the appetizer that we ordered half an hour ago and you failed to bring us\"...please have, not only the good manners, but the intelligence to make sure my 11 year old daughter doesn't see it (kinda reflects in your tip)!  Previous visits included the same long wait to have our order taken.  The wrong food.  The RIGHT food, but as cold as a Stouffers Hungry-Man dinner fresh out of the freezer...oh...and gray shrimp:  (very slight dramatization) Me:  These aren't cooked. Server:  The chef cooked them. Me:  Show the chef...these are still raw. Server:  I think they're supposed to look like that. Me:  Show the chef and see what they think. (wait and return) Server:  The chef cooked them longer. Me:  Why are they still gray? Server:  That's just how shrimp look: Me:  Yes it is...WHEN THEY'RE FREAKING RAW!!  We went on Mother's Day because there was no wait...now we know why.  Stupid us...we ALREADY knew why!    Spend your money elsewhere so this location can close down and hopefully open a restaurant that gives a crap!"}
{"text":"My dear Yelp Friend Thomas S. will kill me for giving this place 4 stars, especially after I teased him for coming here a while ago however, once he (and you) read this review, you might forgive me.  I am here visiting my Mom, her husband and my Grandma. For those of you who follow my or Toni M.'s reviews, Toni is my step-mom, but she and my Dad have been together since I was 7 (almost 30 years now) and though I have never called her \"mom\" she and I are as close as I am to my real mom.  ANYWAY....  I was just in Disneyland where everything is close together and you get to choose which line you stand in. Same could be said for this area of Peoria. It is the land of chain restaurants. You name it, it is here. Applebee's (yep), Red Lobster (yep), Olive Garden (yep), PF, Cheesecake,the list goes on and on. Why Elephant Bar. well here are the reasons:  1. Mom, Husband and Grandma all have 20% off cards for being Sr. Citizens at the Elephant Bar (we are close to Sun City). 2. Grandma had a coupon (this is a running joke in our family btw). 3. Their food doesn't make Grandma sick (though she does complain half way through the meal that her food is cold and then gets a new meal to take home. 4. Big menu  5. Did I say Grandma had a coupon?  Anyway, we drove to town to surprise my mom and grandma. My mom just turned 60 and as a gesture for this milestone, she is having a Bat Mitvah at her synagogue. You see, back when she was turning 13, girls didn't go through this rite of passage. We showed up with out either she or Grandma knowing we were coming. We first came to mom's house (her husband knew) and then they picked up Grandma to meet us at the restaurant. My grandmother came through the door, looked right at me and said \"You look just like my granddaughter\". It took her a minute and when I stood up, she started to cry she was so happy (she is going to be 85 this year).  We had a great waitress who put up with my Grandma. That alone gets a lot of stars in my book. I had a delicious salad (Thai Salad), and everyone else was pleased with their meal (even if half way though Grandma's was cold).  I had been to this location before and it was ASS. This time, the service was great, I ordered well and was happy.   Now, tonight, we shall see what happens...it will be dinner at a local chain not a national one, so we shall see!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service! Our server Lucy took care of us from start to finish. Her genuine attitude and smile with everything made the meal great.   She immediately started by letting us know \"I'm Lucy. And I'll be your server. It's wine Wednesday!\"   Stop.   What.   Wine. Wednesday?   Enough said. Sign me up!   We started our meal with some wine and 2 great appetizer! I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken and shrimp pasta and then boyfriend got the pub burger. The food was excellent and the service was phenomenal!   Thanks Lucy for a great dinner!"}
{"text":"This review is for the bar area only.   Why did we come here on a Friday night? Two reasons.   1) Becuase I've never been here before  2) My wife and I were looking for something close to the house and chill.   I usually want a divey spot or \"hip\" bar to have that last drink at, but we wanted something different and without expectations, a chain restaurant bar it is! We sat down and realized we were the youngest people in here by at least 15 years; this is for sure the happy hour spot for life long secretaries, office workers, and retirees. Not to be deterred we ordered a drink and planned the next move in case this place was bunk.   Dani, our bartender, was great! She kept us entertained, our glasses full, and introduced us to some of the regulars. She did what a good bartender does, kept us happy and at the bar. We didn't drink anything fancy, or sample any food, we kept hanging out because of Dani; it's as simple as that. This is an excellent example of what great customer service will do for a business. Side note, the tab wasn't crazy either, we barely broke $40, and we bought a birthday shot for a lady celebrating her 50th birthday? 50 or not, she took it like a boss.   Would I come here again and try the food? Maybe for brunch, I mean... a Philly Cheese-Steak Frittata sounds ridic.   Dani, I see you. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I luv the mac n cheese here!  Always get really good service here.  Happy hour is awesome."}
{"text":"Go to place for our family, excellent food and menu selection at a reasonable price. American comfort food mixed with Asian fare. Great for children."}
{"text":"The service sucked. Waited for a half an hour before we walled out. The one glass of tea I recieved was good though."}
{"text":"My favorite dining spot from Cali to Nevada.. Got my friend loving the jambalaya...  He loves it here now. Our waitress was the best this evening."}
{"text":"Good place to go for casual dining.    Location: The District near Green Valley Resort Casino (not in the casino) At the end of the The District - a small outdoor mall with several different types of stores including Hallmark, REI, The Walking Store, Anne Taylor Loft, among several others  Bar: has several TVs .. good spot for watching sports.... and some really good looking drinks.  I ordered a non-alcoholic beverage for lunch... a Green Tea Ginger Spritzer... it was horrible and I will not order it again.  But the other drinks look really tasty.  Menu: Really good selection of all types of different foods, does have a slant towards asian-fusion type foods  Food: I've been there before and enjoyed what I ate... this trip was the exception... ordered the Chicken Lettuce wraps and it didn't have much flavor and the sauce didn't help, won't be ordering it again  Service: 3 stars... not stellar, not horrible  Ambiance: Casual and a bit loud when the restaurant is full, but it's a good place to enjoy an easy night out with friends without breaking the bank"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty for a chained restaurant.  Shared a big sample platter w/ my mom in law, THE GRAZER Zesty artichoke dip - parmesan crusted green beans - hand-breaded chicken tenders - sweet potato fries (serves 4), so we had leftovers, TEMPURA SALMON ROLL Seared salmon - avocado - carrots - cucumbers - tofu - soy glaze - sesame seeds (it was more liked cooked salmon but still tasty), & the blackened Mahi Mahi (it was ok).  I would go back for the shareable plates & happy hour.    If you download their app, you can get a free Appetizer"}
{"text":"Was just served cajun chicken. RAW in the middle! Hopefully I don't get sick. Manager was nice and apologetic and removed the chicken from my bill. Definitely need someone overseeing the kitchen!"}
{"text":"We ate here while staying at the Green Valley Ranch. This place sure is lively on a Saturday night. They offer patio seating to enjoy the night air. I enjoyed sitting in the big comfy booth. The open kitchen is a nice touch. You can see the chefs creating meals as you wait for yours. Service was great even though the place was packed. We felt very well taken care of. After a few mai tais- the night was even better. :) A wide variety of meals to chose from, so many I kept turning the menu back and forth trying to decide what to order.  Ticket was a bit pricey- 80$ for the two of us. But that included 2 entrees,  3 alcohol drinks and 2 desserts and also a great location. A fun night thanks to Elephant Bar."}
{"text":"I am out $250 worth of clothing after dining here for dinner. The bartender accidentally spilled my entire glass of red wine onto my shirt, lap and shoes as he was pulling out a menu from our table. Other then bringing me a few cocktail napkins there was no mention of any compensation for the disaster. My blouse, white pants and suede shoes were ruined. When the bill came we were charged full price. Terrible hospitality!!!"}
{"text":"We came here on a whim and for the first and last time and won't be back. The food temps were fine. Not complaining about that. What I will complain about is the quality of the ribeye, mashed potatoes and baked potato.   The ribeye seemed like Denny's quality meat (cheap) and extremely over priced. Also seemed OLD. The potatoes (mashed and baked) were OLD. The service was fine. I must tell you the place was empty and now I know why. Will NOT be back. EVER.   What would Gordon Ramsey do?  Shut this place down and give it a complete make over."}
{"text":"Look, I know Elephant Bar gets a really bad rap for being a mediocre chain restaurant. But it's my family's mediocre chain restaurant and this one is AWESOME. Okay, so the food isn't the best I've ever tasted. But their dishes remind me of my childhood and that's all I need!  Also, the service is fantastic. Our waiter, Edgar, truly hooked it up. Elephant Bar is my mom's favorite restaurant and though it's a bit of a drive, we'll definitely come back when the mood strikes. Thanks again, Edgar and Elephant Bar!"}
{"text":"I have eaten quite a few times at this restaurant and it was always great.  Unfortunately, the menu and service went down hill.  I ordered coffee and wouldn't you know it, no spoon.  After ten minutes our waitress said o yeah I forgot your spoon.  I commented \"Don't worry I used my straw\".  The menu has also changed for the worse.  They use to have a great seafood platter.  No more.  They cut out so many good choices and I feel the choices that are left horrible."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good.  I have had good service at lunch, but, when I have sat in the bar at 'happy hour', the service has NOT seemed to be very \"happy\". We have gone a few times, and will go only if we have a gift card, or White Chocolate Grill is too packed. It's too bad, because I still think its a good value."}
{"text":"Our first time here was in August, 2012. I ordered the ahi dinner, I can't remember what my b/f ordered.  Let me say the ahi was highly recommended by our waiter.  The ahi had zero taste, had poor texture and it was like eating rubber.  My boyfriend didn't even finish his dish. When asked how our dinners were, we were both honest only to have the waiter say, \"sorry to hear that. can I get you the dessert menu?\"  Um, no.    We always give restaurants at least 2 trys.  We went there again New Years Eve (12/31/12). It was busy, but no wait.  They had a new menu of specials and I decided to try the sirloin and lobster tail.  It was highly recommended by our waitress as \"THE best lobster tail she's ever had...\"  She recommended the macadamia crusted mahi mahi to my boyfriend.  We ordered sweet potato fries as an appetizer.    20 minutes later, we still didn't have the fries.  25 minutes later, one of the managers comes to tell us he's sorry, but I ordered the last lobster tail in the restaurant and the chef burned it on the grill.  (Note: it was the first time in my life I ordered lobster tail, go figure).  He recommended the jumbo prawns instead, which I agreed to.  I also asked if we could get our sweet potato fries in 2012.  2 minutes later, our fries come.  3 minutes later, our entrees come (he says he took the prawns from somebody else's dish so we didn't have to wait any longer.)    The prawns were so-so, my steak was very overcooked, my b/f's mahi mahi was dry and flavorless, and my garlic potatoes were on the verge of cold.  At this point, we just wanted to leave so didn't bother sending it all back for bad flavor and temperature.   All this being said, the service was good and they were honest with what was going on.  Our appetizer was comped because it took 30 minutes, and my entree was comped for obvious reasons.  No dessert this time either.  After 2 tasteless meals, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"As a local I've been come for years. The new simplified menu and food is triple the quality and I actually enjoy eating here now. Very happy with their improvements! The chicken lettuce wraps, chicken potstickers, and mac n cheese are great."}
{"text":"What a great experience.  We took my brother to the Elephant Bar for his birthday.  We were served by Jamie who was an absolute doll! She had many suggestions and quickly developed a great rapport with our party. She suggested we sign up for rewards to receive a free app.  Cha Ching! We did the coconut shrimp and the artichoke dip.  Both were very delicious.  For dinner I had the jumbolaya, mom had the Parmesan chicken and shrimp with Alfredo, and the two body builders had the sweet potato fries and burger.  All of us LOVED our food.  And for being a yelper, at check in we received a free dessert.  Of course we had the mud pie.  We will definitely be back.  Great experience."}
{"text":"Decent food. The Long Island I had wasn't very great, but the bartender was happy to take it off the bill for me. I like the atmosphere and the servers are friendly. I would go here again."}
{"text":"Well done lunches! Grilled salmon with brown rice and fresh vegetables! Came with a fusion type red sauce of cilantro/spices. Very well done & our service was A++"}
{"text":"Happy hour is decently priced but service is super slow. I also asked them to lower the sound of the tv bc space was limited and it was on top of the table and instead of being cool and accommodating about it, the were kind of ambivalent about it. They turned it down some bit with 9 other TVs playing the same thing and no one watching it. It seemed kinda silly to not leave it at a decent level or turn on caption on a loud crowded bar. The food was kind of bland and cold and they're was no one to complain too. The drinks were good. But no one ever came to check for a refill."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, got great service. The sweet potato fries with their sauce is simply wow. It is a little loud, but it didn't really bother me. My friend brought her daughter & we found it kid friendly, but still geared toward the adult crowd. Pleased."}
{"text":"Went here for Valentines day. We ordered the potato skin appetizzer which was actually awesome.. The entrees were just sad.. I got some country chicken and my man got a ribeye.. He liked his steak but my meal was inedible. The manager gave us a free dessert and took my meal off the bill, which was respectable. Would I come back-never, recommend- never. Should have just waited in the mile long line for The Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"Great food and service!! Krista worked on Thursday night and was quite attentive and never an empty drink!!! Great service!!! She is a keeper"}
{"text":"When someone recommends a place because the menu is \"like Cheesecake Factory\", I am hesitant. Elephant Bar does in fact have a large and diverse menu, but I found the food to be far beyond the quality of the previously mentioned. The restaurant itself is *very nice* inside, and is upscale without being too upscale.  I was their with the wife and 3 kids (we had a +1 friend for the weekend). We all tried something different and very much enjoyed ourselves.  My oldest (9yo) now thinks it is cool to order off the adult menu, and had herself the \"Half Turkey And Ham Focaccia Sandwich And Soup Combo\" - in her words the sandwich was awesome! She also raved about the soup (Mexican Tortilla), of which I had a bite and also loved. I had the \"Pacific Cove Tropical Crab And Shrimp Louie\" - and while not exceptional, it was very good. Another kid had the kids BBQ ribs, while the other had the chicken fingers and mac... I will note that the one kid said these were the best chicken fingers ever. I took her word for it... as they looked the like chicken fingers to me.  What really set this place apart  for me was the service and waiter...Shawn. He was very attentive, drinks were always full, and gave my oldest a child's desert even though is was not included in her \"big girl\" order. We all commented to each other on what a good server he was. My hats off the Shawn and all the staff."}
{"text":"Elephant bar was our first date and we go there at least once a month because everything is so good. We get the same exact thing as that first night in hopes they never take it off the menu. The petite sirloin with fries and vegetables and some sort of sandwich that my Boyfriend swears by. I especially love that they carry moscato because not a lot of places do.   Updated review..(from a 5 star review) they got rid of both of the items we usually get and ordered something else that wasn't that great. Hearts are truly broken. Not sure when we will be back."}
{"text":"Was not a fan of this place at all. Went here yesterday with a large group for a birthday party. They split the tables and have each table a different server which is expected and not a problem at all with such a large group. Half of my table ordered food. I was not hungry so I didn't order anything besides a beer. I didn't even take two sips out of my beer and the waiter had already brought the check to me and my friend who ordered beer and an app. By the time the food was there he was he came along with the other checks and after he rushed to collect the tabs he ignored us for the rest of the night. Its okay though he saved me from wasting more money at this place with awful service. Didn't try the food so that's why it's 2 stars."}
{"text":"Great service. Food was awesome. Tried a bunch of appetizers...green beans,seared ahi,potato skins, coconut shrimp, tortilla soup, all was on point."}
{"text":"Elephant Bar is a place we used to frequent for work meetings and although the food is decent, I never understood the interest in this place. In a city with a ton of diverse dining options, this would not be my first choice but it is definitely decent. Pricey but edible."}
{"text":"If you can give Red Lobster a 4, I can Give Elephant a 10!  But seriously, for a chain restaurant, this is almost as good as it gets.  I like their ahi tuna....had their Mongolian beef today which was good (notice I did not say very) and Jo had the parmesan chicken which she thought was very moist and good.  Wait staff is almost always very attentive.  Happy hour prices are good, and the bar menu is very good.  If I was comparing this to a locally owned, great restaurant, this would be a 3.5. - but on Yelp, as a chain, I don't mind stretching."}
{"text":"Good place for lunch.  We had six people and they seated us at a very nice table for visiting.  Large menu, but at the high end for lunch (many items in the $12-20 range.)  That's because they use the same menu for lunch and dinner.  Food was ok - not as flavorful as it sounds on the menu.  Really probably worth a 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Elephant was a pretty cool restaurant with good food as well. The atmosphere was pleasant, and the servers/staff were friendly and competent. We tried the artichoke dip appetizer which was delicious as well as some French onion soup which we really liked. After that I got the their signature ribeye dinner. I ordered it medium rare and got it exactly as I ordered which was greatly appreciated! The flavor was great, but I felt the steak was a little tougher than would expect for an expensive signature dish. My wife ordered the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich, and they nailed it. She was super pleased. We will definitely return on one of our next visits to the area."}
{"text":"More than a year since I reviewed Elephant Bar.  So here I go again!  The past few visits I've tried to make a point of ordering different stuff.  Usually I order the jambalaya.  I really like that one.  Tasty, good quantity.  But there is so much more on the menu.  So I'm trying to break my routine.  This visit I ordered the Thai stir fry thing.  It was fine, but there was nothing Thai about it.  It tasted like Chinese sweet and sour.  It was good, don't misunderstand.  But nothing about the dish said \"Thai\".  No peanuts, no heat, nothing.  Just sweet and sour.  My wife had the Cajun chicken, and I tried it.  Definitely give that one a pass.  The chicken was very bland.  Tasted like grilled chicken.  The rice was super-spicy.  Not too much for me, but you really couldn't taste anything except cayenne.  That is not what a Cajun rice is.  Compare and contrast to the rice in the jambalaya (which I realize is mostly a white rice with the jambalaya sauce on it).  Or to a \"dirty rice\" you can get in other restaurants.  This was, frankly, pathetic.  The other dishes we've ordered the past many months were similarly uninteresting, or just plain \"not great\".  So I've had to deduct a star.  The jambalaya is still a favorite, but most of the other stuff just isn't up to par (at least of the things we've tried, and we've probably tried at least a half dozen different things).  If you order the right thing Elephant Bar is not bad, but if you don't it's really hit or miss.  And a lot of things you can get as good or better elsewhere (like burgers and sandwiches).  And they're pricey."}
{"text":"Had a great meal with Sam our server. Had a very good Bacon Cheese Burger. Wasn't sure which dressing to get on salad so Sam brought me all the ones I wanted. Good personal service with a great smile.  Artichoke Dip app was perfect."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here, first time ever. It was around 9:30pm, we decided to sit outside. Normally we get ignored outside. But tonight Vanessa (the server) was amazing. She came right out and waited on us. We had a friendly conversation. And the steaks were amazing and cooked to order. This is one of our new favorite spot. Come here check it out."}
{"text":"I ate there twice this month.  The first time we had appetizers only and the second time I had an entree salad.  The appetizers are all mouthwatering.  The atmosphere is inviting and the decor is intriguing.  It's a great place to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"I went here with friends for dinner, and managed to make it just in time (5 minutes before 7pm) for Happy Hour at the bar. We sat at a booth which is technically still part of the bar, so we were able to sit comfortably and still enjoy Happy Hour prices. Plus 1 star! Our server was friendly and did a fantastic job. Plus another star!  However, what doesn't deserve a lot of stars is the food. The food is average, nothing to rave about. We ordered the following appetizers:  Sweet Potato Fries- Not crispy enough  Quick-Fried Soy-Ginger Calamari- Needed a few more minutes in the deep fryer as the thick calamari pieces were soggy. I love calamari, but Elephant Bar's rendition of my favorite dish wasn't something I loved.   Warm & Spicy Artichoke Dip- Average dip and average chips. I enjoyed the chips more than I enjoyed the dip.   Quick Seared Ahi Tuna- I enjoyed the pieces of peppered tuna over a bed of mixed greens dressed with a soy/sesame oil concoction. One of the better appetizers of the night.    Vietnamese Shrimp Spring Rolls- Not good at all. The rice wrapper was soggy and the filling (especially the shrimp) was boring and sparse. The mango/bell pepper/lettuce salad had an unusual cilantro-y dressing that was way too sweet.   Tempura Salmon Roll- The best appetizer of the night. Teriyaki salmon wrapped up in rice and nori, and then deep fried in a light tempura batter. Crunchy, soft, and delicious.   It's hard to believe that out of all those appetizers, only one left a good impression on me. Elephant Bar isn't my first choice when I'm in the neighborhood hungry."}
{"text":"I went here last night with a friend. We did the late Happy Hour.. The food was really tasty and the service was on point! I want to go again where i can sit and have a meal with more friends to try more stuff. We  had the  Wok- Fried Chicken Lettuce Wraps Delicious.   We also  had the  Pacific Rim Chicken skewers. They were good,  but nothing beat the French Onion Rib Eye Sliders. Oh my god!!  You have to try them to understand. Magical!      We had a few drinks and topped the night off with some  Creme Brulee.  Very nice.  Good atmosphere. Great service, and wonderful food."}
{"text":"My family and I came to Elephant Bar on Monday after we didn't feel like waiting 25 minutes to eat at the coffee shop at Green Valley Ranch. No wait at Elephant Bar so it was an easy choice. If I had to rate this experience based solely on my order of sliders, I would have to give them 1.5 stars. Dry little burgers covered with ketchup. ugh. The saving grace were the sweet potato fries which cost 99 cents extra, but was worth it."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch after strolling and looking in shops while a family member was in town. We both wanted salads and soup and ordered side Cesar salads which were huge and added chicken for another few bucks. I ended up bringing half home and also half of my soup. I ordered the shrimp noodle soup without salmon. If was good but could've used a little bit more of a lime flavor to it in my opinion. Was sweet as some reviewers have stated. I wanted to order dessert to go on the way out and forgot and the bartender (only server working at this point) the restaurant was completely dead this whole time (3-4) she told me she can't help me and walked away very rudely and with an attitude. I didn't get her name but she's older. Short, dark hair with some red in it. Our server Trina was awesome and Lucy is also awesome and hooked us up with dessert so I recommend either of them for good service."}
{"text":"I have tried to eat here several times in hopes that it will be tasty.  The location and ambiance make it a desirable place to spend an evening.  Unfortunately, the food is consistently bland (albeit, quite pretty).  They do have killer drinks, so while we have given up on enjoying dinner there, we often hit it for a pre-movie drink on a weekend evening.  Not sure about the wait, we have never noticed it especially busy...Definitely recommend the top shelf LIT, it's only $0.25 more than the well and HUGE.  :)"}
{"text":"Love elephant bar!! The best part was being taken care of by a good server, his name was Richard, give that guy a raise!!"}
{"text":"The two vegetarian dishes i ordered were really good. Nice ambiance and the waitress that served us was great too. I would recommend this place to my friends"}
{"text":"Danielle was the greatest her customer service was great. The Food was good i will be back for the service"}
{"text":"We took clients here for dinner last night... probably not the best idea.  Our server was pleasant but never available.  My business partner was brought a rocks glass with a chip in the rim, he cut his finger.  When a replacement was brought, there was something frozen in one of the ice cubes.  After all that, we weren't even comped that drink.    OK, how bout some positives?  Food was reasonably priced and portions were good.  I had the salmon and it was actually a very nice piece of fish.  More?  Nope"}
{"text":"Ate here a couple times. Typical mega-chain restaurant experience. Decent food in a money-making factory-like atmosphere. I honestly have trouble distinguishing it from Claim Jumper in my mind's eye."}
{"text":"We went to Elephant Bar as a last minute decision because my party of four was hungry and wanted to go some where near by. Our appetizer dishes, coconut shrimp and the artichoke dip were very tasty and delicious. Unfortunately all the other dishes were lack luster. From the Ahi Poke, Clam Chowder Soup, Chicken Sandwich, Philly Cheese steak, and Orange Chicken all failed to have enough seasoning or meet our expectations. Our server was also very absent minded and rarely was around. We had to look for her to get random items or refills. All we kept hearing is \"hold on a second\". Unfortunately this restaurant has potential but fails to meet expectations from quality and taste of food. I'm adding an additional star because the manager was willing to hear our feedback and address the issue."}
{"text":"I damn near broke my finger on my chair.  And they hate giving refills.  Food was ok, higher than Hardee's but lower than Applebee's.  Nice interior.  A bit pricey.  Poor service and poorly maintained furniture."}
{"text":"Food sucks.  Tortilla soup was spicy beyond belief.  Garlic bread with cheese was like something a child would make."}
{"text":"This place is great.  I had the pot roast his time and i didnt give myself time to snap a pic.  Lol.   I came here about three years ago and I still love it.   Its nice to not eat on the strip!   Great food and good prices especially for Vegas."}
{"text":"So.. my favorite animals are elephants and I heard great things about this place.  When I first walked in the decor was great and I thought it would be quite the spot.    Boy was I wrong.    The tower of dirty drinks on the bar that needed to be placed in the dishwasher followed by the manager, Zoltan, flirting and talking pictures with the girls sitting at the bar while my drink sat empty was quite disappointing.  We did however take advantage of the elephant bar rewards program which got us a free appetizer immediately online when we registered.  We got the edamame, coconut shrimp skewers, and spinach artichoke dip.  It was all decent, at best.  We then had the pleasure of speaking with Zoltan, the manager, who when we asked if he was the manager he said \"No, I just hang out here\".  He was then asked by us why this tower of glasses was sitting next to us and he just made excuses for it.  We asked if he needed to hire a dishwasher to assist with the dishes & he said no and that the bartenders should be doing a better job.  He didn't act like he cared at all.  He was too busy taking selfies with the drunk blonde across the bar.    I then went to the bathroom where the toilet didn't flush & there was just enough toilet paper for me.   Roy the bartender was very attentive however the other bartender was about as bad of a sever as you can get.  I would order through him & then he would just tell Roy what I ordered & Roy would serve me.  After we had commented on the pile up of glasses the bartender made a comment to the one server who was dropping her glasses off and she said \"I don't really give a shit\" and then Quartae the bartender said \"Fuck off\".. in ears reach of myself and the rest of the bar to hear.  It was quite the experience and I don't think ill ever be back!"}
{"text":"There are no halves but this place gets 3.5... Great Happy Hour especially with the food.  My wife had the Korean tacos and it came with a margarita for $6.95!!! Tacos were good but not great, tortilla was not that great.  I had the lettuce wraps and they were delicious.  Chicken and veges were super fresh. If you want an appetizer get the buffalo chicken tenders, very tasty."}
{"text":"Decent menu. Alert.....Happy hour has changed and its ok still but prices and menu not as good. Still like it but so so on the happy hour."}
{"text":"Used to love this place... Recently fined here and was told by the waitress that the restaurant was under new owner ship since the last couple years, they took all the food food off the menu and they do not support military , as owner says we do not give veterans a discount! Very sad :-("}
{"text":"The service was pleasant, but not competent. The food was a major disappointment, capped off by a burger ordered medium well, and came rare . . . I have a picture, but do not see a way to post it . . . NASTY.  But what capped off this review, I tried to call the manager multiple times, and they never answered their phone. I posted a review to their website and asked for a manager to call, and two weeks have passed, and still not call."}
{"text":"The service was great. Our server was good at taking our orders and our drinks were refilled often.  Elephant Bar really deserves 2 stars. The food is not that good. The problem is that the restaurant offers too many choices. You can identify this problem by looking through their menu. Because it offers too many choices, there's a good chance that your meal isn't going to meet your expectations.  My friend and I ordered sweet potato fries, the grande burrito, and sweet and sour chicken. The burrito was fine. However, the sweet and sour chicken was worse than the stuff served at Chinese buffets. The meat was dry and there wasn't enough sauce. My friend didn't touch most of her chicken and I can understand why. It was a quick and unpleasant way to lose $12+tip+tax.  I really liked the ambiance of the restaurant and the service; however, the food was a waste of money."}
{"text":"We just had lunch and that was great experience the waitres was unbelievable frindly and nice one of the best her name is  Tina .and then the GM come over and check with us about the food and Service, he was extremely kind and Real, highly recommended. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The Elephant Bar, or what I like to call the \"EBAR\" is my favorite hangout in Lakewood, CA.   You would think, that because I'm in Vegas, why would I bother to visit this establishment. Her name is Nancy Rodriguez. She moved to this location, after spending numerous years at the Lakewood branch. She has not only been a great friend, but an awesome employee. As usual, service was impeccable. She not only made sure that we were taken care of, but also the other customers that were dining this evening. She's fast on her feet, and always has a smile on her face. Las Vegas EBAR is blessed to have her.   Let me not fail to mention, Mike Tuttle, the GM, who came up to us and welcomed us. Such a humble man, who cares about his staff, and his store. Thank you Mike!"}
{"text":"First of all, our waitress Ashley was phenomenal; her service was excellent. However, our food was just bad. I ordered the Misoyaki Salmon. The salmon was the only hot thing on my plate. The vegetables underneath were horribly undercooked and completely not seasoned whatsoever, and somehow cold while the rice was dry and and barely at room temperature. While my salmon was barely seasoned at all, it was hot and cooked perfectly; so I'm very confused on how the cooks got rice wrong, of all things. Same comments go for my friends food."}
{"text":"Blah!  Have you ever had something so bad that it makes you want to throw up in your mouth?  Well, if not, the Elephant Bar can help you with that!  Don't settle for the seats by the kitchen because it is like being in the kitchen unless you have hearing difficulties!  If you close your eyes, it's almost like someone is constantly playing the drums (with pans) right behind your ears.  The food is mediocre at best.  I had the seafood salad (or whatever they call it) which tasted like a dried up crab.  For the record, I've never had a dried up crab, but I think it tasted like that, especially since I got a crab ligament stuck in my throat.  The half sandwich, soup, and fries is a much safer play.    I do like the decor though.  It is like being on an African Safari.  However, it was not enough to mask the shortfalls..."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good - but the variety is amazing.  This is a great place to go to when your party can't decide exactly what they want.   The portions are large, and the wait staff has been good to us every time we've gone.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Happy hour provides a great selection of food and drinks at a fair price.  Atmosphere is wonderful.  Makes you feel like you are on vacation."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to stop for a drink.  Haven't eaten there.  There is a jungle motif.  It's a little out of the way, but if you're up in that area, not a bad place to stop off..."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this establishment when the wife and I visited a few weeks back. We had a coupon for 2 for 20 and we decided we would finally use it and I must say the food was excellent. The ambiance of the place is magnificent.....our server was decent but could have been better.....and the Creme Brule I had for dessert was heavenly. We will definitely be returning....and hopefully the service will be better because I really wanted to give this locale 5 stars. Eat, Drink and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great server who did very well with our service. She was attentive and present. Her name was Catallina. She did really well. Our food tasted very good. My reason for a lower rating is because I have come here many times and always love it but they have completely changed the menu and every favorite thing I loved is gone. I'm so Disappointed with the new menu. Not sure if I will return."}
{"text":"Fantastic service from Brian, delicious food from the chefs & a wonderful atmosphere!  I would recommend Elephant Bar & Restaurant to anyone. Sit in Brian's section, he's the best waiter to have, always friendly & fast."}
{"text":"I have historically been a huge fan... came in for happy hour today.... restaurant was 1/8 full. Ordered a couple happy hour drinks and snacks.... they were out of potstickers... my favorite.  It took 40 minutes for my apps to get here.... maybe they were all busy in the kitchen making more potsticker... very disappointed...  Update: 3/7/18: came in today looking for my very favorite items: potstickers, Mac and cheese and  their Macau noodle soup. They changed the potstickers to \"homemade\" not a good change... maybe food cost was an issue...? They came out grossly over cooked... I.e. crisp.... never had crisp on potstickers... not good. Well ok, I can look forward to my worlds favorite Mac and cheese... was told that yesterday they changed from Elbow pasta to penne which ruined the dish texture and taste....I always have one to go..  I am canceling the to go one...... and oh by the way... it was cold when it came out. The soup was still good. The place just lost my bookmark and return business..  bummer, bummer.. was literally one of my favorites in Vegas.  One very positive thing, they took off the potstickers and the Mac & Cheese from the bill. One thing i MUST add... the server (bartender) was superb through this... it can usually get pretty sticky through something like this, but she was phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"Nanette deserves a raise. Please give her a raise. She's amazing, professional and a gem. Food is as expected. Tasty. Normal food."}
{"text":"Waitress was very nice and funny, atmosphere was okay. Prices were very low, and I thought my jambalaya was pretty good.  May go there again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"We always enjoy eating at the Elephant Bar, especially when we have Edgar as our server. He's very attentive and friendly. He always makes sure we're all doing alright with our food. Every time we go eat there, we always reserve a table in his area.  Delicious food, nice location, great service!"}
{"text":"Elephant Bar in Chandler last night for bday dinner was awesome. I'd never been there and hadn't heard much about it but they have a huge menu and the service was best I've had in a while. Check it out."}
{"text":"Never really understood the concept 100% - Elephant and American cuisine....with a touch of Asia and some??  Regardless, happy hour is pretty chill and affordable.  Cheap drinks always catch my attention!  Yes, I'm part of an AA group - Affordable Alcohols!  Got some cheeseburger with our drinks, which I guess, was part of a combo -- Wow!  If McDonald's would only do such a thing (I'll have a CK McNugget Combo with Johnny Walker Black and Coke please!)  Service was great at the bar, which I recommend of course.  The ambience was real chill, but then again we're out on the Westside of town where everything is starting to become quite sedentary (retirement). - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Tonight was the second time I've been to the elephant bar in a long time. It was soo good. I love that they have happy hour from 3-7 and 9-close. We sat at the bar and ordered the mai tai, pineapple chipotle margarita, and Bloody Mary! They were all very good. For food we ordered the chicken lettuce wraps, potato skins and nachos they are all $6 during happy hour and they were all super delicious. My favorite was the chicken lettuce wraps. I would highly recommend this place to people I'm honestly shocked they only have 3 stars!"}
{"text":"The sirloin steak sandwich now come with fresh fruit vs the grilled tomatoes.    Looks like an afterthought and doesn't seem to go with the dish.   Seared ahi tuna salad overcooked with TONS of onions.   Waitress uninterested and brought us the desert menu WITH our check.   I guess just in case  ;(.   Not enjoyable and will not return"}
{"text":"Did anyone else feel like they where in the movie Jumanji? Seriously, I was on the look out for the safari guy the whole time. The restaurants ambience is exotic and inviting. Loved the elephants everywhere. We were greeted friendly and enthusiastically by our host. Good start. Asked us for our drink order right away. Even better. The waitress comes by kinda rushed. As first timers, my boyfriend ask what the restaurant is all about. The waitress brushes the question off by just explaining the menu is two sided and it flips over. Thanks Captain Obvious . The Mai Tais were unbelievably good and half off because it was Mai Tai Mondays. We started with the green beans and the pot stickers. The green beans were pretty good and the pot stickers weren't anything to rave about. I ordered the street tacos and the boyfriend ordered the trout. He had food envy. The tacos were delicioso. The trout was drought! Overall, we left full and overall pretty satisfied."}
{"text":"This place is cheese-tastic to the max.  The decor reminds me of a place you would find inside a Six Flags or safari themed adventure daycare or something. There are elephants EVERYwhere. I get it, Elephant Bar, but there's a way to do it and theres a way to beat a dead elephant into the ground and then run it over with a safari jeep and then wear it as a hat.   My friend and I had just seen that Chimpanzee movie in the same complex so we thought we would be clever and come here for a beer. I can't report on the food, since we weren't hungry. We did check out the menu though and holy crap it's huge. I really dislike huge menus, it's usually a sign of lack of focus. It's all sort of fusion stuff, and if you don't know what Fried Shrimp or Mac n Cheese looks like, don't despair, there are pictures of every dish. Ugh.   It's interesting that every inch of this place is covered with safari themed decor, but the patio is completely devoid of decoration. It's just a few patio chairs and tables fenced in on the side of the building as an afterthought. I guess it was a nice respite from all the elephants and giraffes and nonsense.   $22 gets you three large beers not including tip for the nice, but completely average bartender who called me \"dude\".   Meh."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great service and food every time I've been there. I've taken my family and clients and every time we've left happy. Love the variety on the menu though it could be a bit big. The coupons are great as well."}
{"text":"Good food, GREAT SERVICE.  It was the night before Valentine's Day so it was crazy busy and my boyfriend and I were seated in the the hostess' estimated time of 20 minutes. We sat down order the app and food and got the appetizer in a little slower than good time but hey it was busy and the staff was working hard.  Our food came and as the server was putting down my boyfriends food I noticed there was blue cheese. I know he would never order blue cheese on a burger, so I ask the waiter and he said it's the PEAR BURGER and he wanted a PUB BURGER. Seeing as the dining room was crazy loud and it just seemed like he didn't hear us correctly, I just laughed and said its totally okay and he corrected the problem, came back, and offered us a free dessert to go for the trouble. THATS HOW YOU PLEASE A CUSTOMER, and how you fix a mistake."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i decided to try out this place because he had a good experience at a location out of state. We went in for happy hour and we were excited about it because the happy hour menu had a nice variety of things to try. Lets start with drinks - First round I had the Raspberry Lemon Drop Martini and it was really good. My boyfriend had the Mojito and it was good also. Second round i had the Sangria Blanco and it was AWFUL. It tasted like watered down sprite with a couple of fruits in it.   Food - We had the Tempura Salmon Roll, Calamari, Artichoke Dip. The Salmon Roll was so gross and spongy tasting. I mean, i think i deserve that for ordering something like that outside of a sushi spot. The Calamari was just OK. Definitely nothing special. The Artichoke Dip was really watery, I'm not use to my artichoke dip being like that. We even let it cool, and it still stayed pretty watery. So, you figure we would of just gave up after three strikes, but my boyfriend was still hungry and so he ordered the pretzels. It was a little burnt, but it was okay. Can't go too wrong with a pretzel. It seems like we weren't the only people that didn't care too much for the food because we saw some people in the dining room send back their food.  At the end when we paid, we got our bill back with someone elses credit card. A mistake of course, but we made sure to keep our receipt just in case. I really wanted this to be on my list of great happy hours because the menu for happy hour has so much, which is nice....but it didn't make and has been kicked off my HH list. My boyfriend and i definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"Had a great experience tonight at the elephant bar. It's been a few years since I've been to one and I have to say I definitely like the new changes.they have a brand new happy Dani was very knowledgeable and Trent the manager even stopped by to check to make sure everything was delicious I will definitely be back soon it's truly a hard thing to find a place that makes you feel welcome like they did"}
{"text":"Edgar, our waiter was so enthusiastic and helpful! The drinks are perfect and the food is always good."}
{"text":"2.5 - One star for cleanliness, another for happy hour drinks, .5 for just okay service.  Me and my girlfriends had a prebirthday celebration and yep, it was sorta disappointing. We ordered Creamy Mac n Cheese (3.50), 2 Salmon Roll (6 bucks), Ginger and Soy Calamari (6 bucks) - everything from their Happy Hour List. Plus 2 Maitais and a Mojito. We also had their Appetizer Sampler for almost 15 bucks. The only decent thing out of their food selection that we had was the Salmon Roll, and it was just okay, not superb, not memorable. We felt that almost everything was frozen and just deep fried when ordered. The Coconut Shrimp from the Appetizer Sampler was just meh, it's like fresh out of the frozen aisle from Safeway. And don't get me started on the Ginger Soy Calamari, Oh dear. We were confused if we were eating actual calamari or tofu. It was so bland and the texture was too soft. The drinks were okay though. MaiTai was on point. Our server isn't that bad either, but again not memorable or superb. Won't be coming back here anymore. Or any other Elephant Bar chains, unless they actually made something fresher than what they're offering now. Summary: Overpriced Frozen Food Taste :("}
{"text":"My parents and I used to patron here quite frequently, but we had not been here in awhile. We came in on a lark after learning about the music festival in Tempe and deciding not to pay $10 for parking to eat at Rula Bula, our first choice.  We came in and were handed a thin, laminated menu, a far-cry from the book they used to have. Immediately, we knew things had changed. Elephant Bar has always suffered from an identity crisis, and I always found their menu long-winded and muddled. Limiting the menu could be good, if they cut the right things.   Looking through it, I could tell that the identity crisis continues, but we decided to stay and give it a try. We ordered the parmesan green beans for an appetizer, which was excellent. We had asparagus prepared in a similar way at Longhorn, but these were better. The sweet chili sauce that comes with it is very good. Five stars.  My mom and I ordered the lettuce wraps, and my dad ordered a burger with caramelized onion, pear and blue cheese. My dad's burger was excellent. It was well-cooked and flavorful. My mom and I were both disappointed with the lettuce wraps. They had an \"off\" flavor and lacked texture. We doctored them the best we could, dumping the tamarind sauce all top, mixing in the  mango salsa and even asking for limes to boost the acid level. We lathered on peanut sauce and sprinkled salt, but it still managed to taste bland and uninspiring.   We each ate half, but our server could see we were dissatisfied. She offered to get us something else, but we declined. The manager came over and offered us a complimentary dessert, which was excellent. She helped us for the rest of our visit and was very pleasant.  Even though the visit was not what we had remembered and there were some lows, overall most of our food was tasty and the service was excellent. I would recommend with fine print: avoid the lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"This place, I'll tell you what! The food is delicious, but the service is grade A+++ 10 stars! My first time here has been a truly great experience. Between the great food and above phenomenal service, I will be a new regular here! If you haven't checked them out yet, I highly recommend doing so asap!"}
{"text":"It has been a really long time since I have been to the Elephant Bar and I was just there recently for a my friends Bachelorette /Bridal party. They were informed weeks prior that we were coming so it you would think they would have been a little bit more prepared. Sadly they were not. Although the staff were friendly enough, there just were not enough of them to take care of our party of 18 along with the other tables they had to take care of inside. There was one lonely bartender and unfortunately this person could not keep up with all the orders that were being thrown at them from us along with any other patrons in the restaurant. Any time it takes more than 30 mins (not kidding) to get a drink that you have repeatedly asked your server about, then its a problem. Especially when it is something simple like a glass of wine. The food took a long time to receive as well, but I will say it was pretty good once it arrived. Sadly some people were missing items with their orders, but they did say they enjoyed their meal once they got all the missing items.   IDK.. you let me down Elephant Bar. You knew we were coming and you were not prepared for us. Next time, try to be a little bit more prepared by having a few more servers and at least two bartenders on duty when you are expecting a big party. Better to be over-prepared instead of under-prepared."}
{"text":"I love these kind of casual dining places. A nice place to get appetizers, a variety of beer and good food. The food is fun and there are a few healthy options. The atmosphere is good place to meet up with friends to catch up and share plates and try out different drinks. The location is nice as well because once your done eating you can go for a walk and shop. Love it!"}
{"text":"Amazing burger!!!   Madeto perfection and then I added a side of brown gravy for the fries!  It was delish!!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to give The Elephant Bar a try despite the reviews.  It started out with promise as the zesty artichoke dip was actually really good and the chips were not overly salty like a lot of other places.  I ordered the blackened mahi mahi with mango salsa.  The mahi was slightly over cooked, not enough to make it inedible but enough to notice and the mango salsa was terrible but the mango butter made up for the salsa.  My husband got the Cajun chicken and it tasted like unseasoned microwaved meat.  It was really thin chicken breasts and the creamed spinach it came with was terrible.   We won't be going back."}
{"text":"A step or two below Cheesecake Factory. The interior looks more fancy than a Chili's or TGI Fridays. We ate here for lunch over the weekend... I got the sesame chicken stir fry, wife got some sort of salad. The salad didn't have any flavor and was watery. Like they washed the lettuce in the same bowl that it came out in. The sesame chicken was lacking chicken. There were seriously 3 or 4 bites of chicken in the whole thing. The rice and vegetables were decent but I was hoping to actually eat chicken with my chicken dish. The place is kid friendly and my kid liked his quesadilla. His meal included an ice cream sundae in a fried wanton-like shell. So, they get points for that."}
{"text":"This was the first time I had been to an Elephant Bar location outside of Arizona and the saying is true, \"Everything IS better in California\". The veggies were less fresh, the lamb was less robust and the seafood was just a bit too seafood-y for my taste. They need to call their counterparts in California and switch food suppliers STAT."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed with my last visit.   Went for lunch on a Tuesday with my boyfriend and his daughter around 1:30, it was pretty dead, only about 4 other seated tables. We were seated quickly, waited for about 10 minutes for a server and no one came. We eventually had to go up to the bar to ask for someone to take out order. The bartender was very apologetic, friendly and took our order quickly. I ordered the BBQ chicken salad, BF got a bacon cheddar burger and the little one got a cheese burger off the kids menu.   Salad was very tasty with good portions and lot of different ingredients for a nice variety of flavor. BFs burger was bland, and they forgot his onion strings. It was a couple dollars extra for the burger meal to be upgraded with sweet potato fries. They were decent, all 15 of them. The kids meal burger was incredible tasteless with a stale bun. She took 3 bites and refused to eat the rest.   All in all, we will not come back. We were offered a free desert for the lack of service, which was good and a nice gesture, which warrants 2 stars."}
{"text":"The outdoor patio is awesome when it's not oven temperatures outside. Very clean and totally love the lil safari decor. Their Pad Thai is SO good! Strawberry Daiquiri was pretty delish and refreshing. C+!"}
{"text":"Get the Asian food. Every time we go, my wife gets the seared ahi or some other Asian dish. I try it and it is wonderful. But every other type of food that I have had there is mediocre at best. Usually it is flavorless and made with low quality ingredients. On the upside, the service has always been great. The atmosphere is wonderful. Just remember, get the Asian food."}
{"text":"This place was suggested by my two old friends who I hadn't seen since 1955.  They were the \"kids next door\" (brother and sister) when I lived in Lima Ohio from birth to 7 years old and I found out they were living in the Phoenix area.  I got their phone numbers from another \"kid\" from our block in Ohio, got in contact and arranged this get together while I was in the area.  We met in the bar/lounge area and talked non-stop for about three hours!    I had a Sam Adams.  It wasn't as dark as I was hoping but had good flavor.  We got three appetizers but I was too busy visiting to eat much.  The chicken tenders were good quality with a nice dipping sauce.  The chicken quesadilla was pretty good.  The Bruschetta wasn't as fresh as that I've had in the past.  The prices were very good.  The place was lively, but not too noisy so we could easily hear each other and the waiter was attentive and polite.  All in all it was a very good choice for our visit.  If I lived in the area I would like to try the food here sometime. (5/1/09)"}
{"text":"I love the food, drinks and service at this restaurant.  The ambiance is also good."}
{"text":"Elephant Bar has quickly become my girlfriend and I's favorite restaurant. We love going here for an afternoon appetizer, we usually get the \"Grazer.\" It's AMAZING! We have also dined for dinner and the entrees were also very good. We have not been let down yet. The last few times we have gone in we have had Joe as our waiter and it's rare to find someone who provides service like he does. He remember our names, drinks, food and the special requests to our order. To say the least its very impressive. Thanks Joe!! Overall Elephant Bar is a must try! Anyone looking for great food and good service this is your place!"}
{"text":"First time in to the restaurant.  Took five minutes to be seated.  It was busy but not so busy that there was a wait...except for us.  Seated and realized this was not a place to have a conversation with my friends.  The people in the kitchen were yelling at each other.  The register was behind us and the wait staff would holler at another server to help them or they were hurrying to get to the station before someone else.   Our server was Andres and he rushed us the entire time.  He asked for our food order when we placed our drink order.  He brought us the bill before we were done eating.  We wanted dessert and he just kept rushing us.  It was so strange because it wasn't like they needed to turn over tables, there were plenty of empty tables.    I don't think we'll be back"}
{"text":"Went the other night and sat in the bar.  Our food was really good.  Our water tasted awful and had a small leaf floating in it.    I got a beer and the french onion sliders.  I knew the bill was wrong but my friend said to just let it go and made me pay and leave.  Just came home n checked the price to make sure I wasn't wrong..  I got billed $8 and $6 for my food and beer and their website and the menu say otherwise.  I ordered the beer cause it was a little bit of a deal for Happy Hour and ended up getting billed separately..    I didn't even really need a beer I am just a sucker for a deal.  6 bucks for one small beer is not a very good happy hour price.  http://www.elephantbar.com/stayhappy2/"}
{"text":"I love this place!! I had a 16 Oz ribeye with awesome loaded mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese... soooooo good! But it's not just the food that brings me back, it's the fantastic staff. I'm always greeted with a big smile and hello from Dani the bartender . With her boisterous laugh and great attitude she makes you feel right at home. I was also greeted by the manager Trent who brought out my steak with a big hello. The food was great and so we're Dani and Trent!! All in all, I will be a repeat customer for a very long time!!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best.  Service was slow.  I don't think I'll return.  Just unremarkable..."}
{"text":"Food is great here!   The only negative thing is the dark atmosphere.   You need a flashlight to read the menu!"}
{"text":"Food was...interesting. Don't get me wrong it didn't taste bad at all but it seems like they focused a bit too much on the presentation.   The rice was prepared well and the fish didn't taste too fishy. I know that sounds weird but some places over or under season salmon and that just ruins it. They did a fairly solid job. I wasn't falling all over myself for it but it was tasty.  The bread tray that they present you with upon ordering isn't your typical rolls and butter. They serve you several different choices of bread and the butter options aren't bad either. The drinks were a bit stronger then I would like for a nice dinner out, but I'm not one to complain about a drink, with more DRINK then chase."}
{"text":"Tried the shrimp scampi in lobster sauce it was good as was everyone else's food. Steak orders were perfectly cooked and cheesecake was delicious. Nice calm atmosphere for a family dinner with a good selection of cocktails, and red wines likewise was a good selection. Food here never disappoints!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Elephant Bar for a little over 2years now and we absolutely love it here. We are always greeted promptly and the servers are attentive to your needs/wants. My go to servers are Jamie (always my go to), my runner up would be Edgar.  We have been there for wine Wednesdays and the Sangrias are divine, we also enjoy the red blend that they have. There is a shareable special that we tried, and all of the items on the menu were great, from lettuce wraps, to salmon roll, poke poke, chicken popstickers, crispy shrimp, etc...they are great   Our favorite entree is the jambalaya, we like the soups chicken tortilla and tomato soup... we can go on and on about how great the place is, JUST GO!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went in around noon on saturday, September 19, 2015. There was probably 3 tables including ours in the whole resturant. Our servers name was Jordan. I think he was actually a bartender and just had to take a table? Let me just say the food was AMAZING but Jordan's service was HORRIBLE. He took our order with his arms crossed leaning up against the wall, he acted like we were such a inconvience to him. Our food took about 47 minutes to come out and it was messed up. Probably cause he never wrote anything down or even apologized. He never refilled our drinks. A Busser came by and asked if we would like another drink.  He came and dropped the check and never said a word. Didn't ask how our food was or anything. We are both servers on the strip and I WOULD NEVER TREAT A GUEST LIKE AN INCONVENIENCE. I will never go back there again and I'm going to be sure to tell all my friends and coworkers to avoid this place. Really a bummer too."}
{"text":"This place is closed...signs down, empty building. We hadn't been here for several months so thought we would stop in. Surprised to see the bad reviews prior to them closing. This used to be a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Reasonably-priced.  New menu with great food for the price. 12 for a steak and side is a sweet deal. My go had a burger and we had 3 drinks. Our bill was under 60 bucks! Service was well attended.  Happy to say I would come back."}
{"text":"I LOVE their wok.....great flavor.  The lamb shank and herb salmon is amazing too.  But NOTHING beats their Creme Brulee.  AMAZING.  It's a fun place to take the kids too."}
{"text":"Ended up here with the in-law's after an unsuccessful attempt to procure a vacuum from the JC Penney home store.  The last time I was here I ordred a macadamia crusted tilapia that was adequate but the portion was severly lacking.  This time I decided to play it safe and ordered a teriyaki chicken and rice dish.  I'm really not sure what this has to do with elephants or africa but it seems that most places with oversized menu's tend to offer something of this variety.  the menu said crispy teriyaki chicken, the chicken wasn't crispy but it was well cooked and the sauce wasn't bad.  all in all the meal wasn't bad. but nothing memorable."}
{"text":"This place was decent enough.  Nothing stood out about it though.  Service was good....waitress was friendly and made good recommendations.  Decent margaritas.  With so many other restaurants in the area we probably wouldn't choose this place again, although I might try out their happy hour somtime."}
{"text":"We went last night as a family. I have never been before. We started with the mozzarella with pita and parmesean green beans. For dinner, I ordered the lemon garlic chicken with brown rice. Everything was wonderful. I wish I could remember our waitress's name because she was wonderful. Everything was pleasant. Especially the wonton sundae desserts! Will defiantly return."}
{"text":"Ever went to one of those places where you leave thinking It wasn't bad, it was not great so your desire to return is minimal.  It had been a few years since being here and ordered pot stickers, orange peel chicken, and a couple of tequila based drinks.  I'll admit the drink was really good, it went down too fast, it was one of those cocktails where after three of them, you be buzzing quite a bit.  The pot stickers were ok, hot and fresh, but no big deal.  I ordered the orange peel chicken which had great orange zest type taste, but the chicken was missing something, that I've got gotten at other places, it didn't have a crispiness to the pieces so it was mundane.  We didn't order off the desert menu either, I think this place needs to update/add new menu items and I left the place thinking, I didn't need to return for another 3 years."}
{"text":"Usually this is a great spot to go to. However, me and my girlfriend recently visited and the air was broken with no mention, nothing. We sat there in the bar sweating our butts off until we realized it was the same temperature outside so we moved out there. We heard from our friends the air had been broken a week earlier and i guess it hasn't been fixed yet. Vegas heat...not good. Plus, i feel for the servers who have to deal with this. Hopefully they can get this fixed. The food and drinks were great but unfortunately the lack of air and i guess the fact it's been broken for awhile isn't cool."}
{"text":"Danielle our server was so attentive! She was so positive and always happy to help us with our requests (may they be excessive). She then signed us up for the rewards program! I can't wait to request her when I get back!"}
{"text":"Love the food...not so much the service.  Went for lunch, stood at the front to be seated...and waited...and waited...and waited.  All the while the manager was sitting talking with an employee at a table right in plain sight.  Did he bother to get someone to help? No.  Did he acknowledge us? No.  So at the end if the meal when he came to the table to introduce himself, I really wondered why he even bothered.  Will I continue to go there?  Yes, I like the food and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Do I love this place? No. Do I hate it? Not quite Do I find it mediocre to switch things up a bit? Hell yes.  some restaurants get old after awhile day after day IMO. we came here to get burgers(i would not trust getting Chinese or \"wok\" inspired dishes from an Americanized fusion place. If I want good Chinese or whatever I will go to where the goodness is really at. Which is NOT here. After not eating all day I ordered the Santa Barbara burger with regular french fries. ehhhh....Nothing amazing. Not much flavor the chefs got the color completely on point though as far as medium rare which is not usual for my luck. I ordered it with no onions and its a damn good thing i am not allergic. Because there was definitely onion on it.  Hidden below the patty sneaky bastards.  Trying to kill me or something. Geeze!  I ordered a weird concoction of a drink (half club soda/lemonade)(Woot DD!) and i had to search high and low as I sat stuffing my face with my burger and hoping to god she would hurry up and get to our area so I can wave her down for a refill.  One thing I happen to love dearly is when I do NOT have to wave down a waitress to refill a drink. Especially if refills are free!  I swear they do it on purpose to not come around so they do less or they are doing way too much and have too much area to cover.  Will I go back?  Sure i guess. Not by my choice though."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after I received a \"coupon\" ish thing in my mailbox. $9.95 for a 3 course meal. Main dish, salald and dessert. On top of that a $1.50 Mai Tai. So we arrive and are seated immediately. There are plenty of booths which is always a plus. The decor is junglelike but it's not Rainforest Cafe, in fact it pails in comparison. They could've done better, especially for calling themselves \"Elephant Bar\"  At first scan I noticed all around us were \"seniors\" so, I was kind of doubting the intensity of the flavors that would come out of the kitchen right off the bat. I ordered the house salad (excellent) with the Macademia Nut Chicken. My first assumptions were wrong, it was good, really good, and there was plenty. Great flavor, the chicken was incredibly moist, the veggie medley was unique and perfect.. no complaints at all. I would definitely return to try other items. The Mai Tai was great and NOT watered down. Last but not least was the dessert.. I had the brownie sundae and my partner in crime had the regular sundae. Really you can't screw that up so there's nothing to say there. Great first date place, or maybe catching up with a friend spot. It's casual, could be business casual. Final comments I will be back, no question about it."}
{"text":"Wanted to give them 5 stars because I have been a loyal elephant bar customer for over 10 years. I always ate at the location in Burlingame, CA and expected the same customer service and quality in Vegas. Unfortunately, I didn't. I called and made reservations for 10:30pm on a Thursday go celebrate our anniversary, as this restaurant was my favorite place growing up. Sadly we showed up at 10:30 and the whole dining floor was vacant except the bar area and we waited over 5 minutes to be greeted. The host was gone and I believe the bartender had to come up and tell us they were closed. I firmly expressed my disappointment and was upset that I had even made reservations by phone for our anniversary night, and besides the fact that the restaurant closed at 11:00 not 10:30. I told them we had a reso and they seated us. We had such slow service as the lady was taking care of people at the bar and us and we waited over 10 minutes for water. I work in a restaurant too and mentioned that this was unacceptable. We began to receive better service from the manager himself and were constantly then being checked on up which was appreciated. The night started out bad and I had higher expectations, but it ended well and the food was exceptional like always. I just hope next time I visit we will have a better time with the service."}
{"text":"We go there for the burgers. They are great. Order medium rare :) we also like the crunchy green beans. we use to really enjoy the happy hour menu but they changed it up a few months back that why I'm giving them 3 stars but the burger deserve 5 stars :) sometimes the bar are is somewhat noisy but I guess u have to expect that cuz your in the bar area :) but can I ask ..Why fix something if it wasn't broken? ( meaning the happy hour menu)"}
{"text":"Even though it is a chain and always expect less, I am always pleasantly surprised when I go here.  Food and service is always quite good.  The last time I went, the manager ran out the door because I left my Iphone.  Can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Gave a 1 star for the drinks only... The food and service was the worse I have had in a long time.  We started by ordering our drinks they came and were very good. Then ordered an appetizer after stopping our waitress after 15 minutes of waiting for her. We got the artichoke dip. It was very running. We had our appetizer not even a minute and they were placing our dinner in front of us... We didn't even try our appetizer and when I questioned not even our waitress she was like well do you want me to take it back...  I ordered the teriyaki chicken... It was very salty. My fiancée had the rack of ribs and rice. It also was very salty and didn't really eat any of it also the rice was very dry. More then the food being disappointing the service so bad. Our waitress came over twice during the whole time and both times we stopped her... She never smiled or asked us how everything was. When she brought us our bill she just put it on our table without saying a word. So you would think it's just the waitress but no there was a manager he walked by us 8 times and never said a word to us or looked our way and he would walk up to were the food was out to be really to serve and he would stand there rubbing his beard and then would pick up the plates to take them and serve them. Just very disappointing after all the wonderful things we have heard about this place."}
{"text":"I've never written a Yelp review before, but after my experience at Elephant Bar today I felt that I had to do so.  My good friend and I, at my recommendation, dined at the restaurant today. There were only a few customers, midday on a Sunday, so we obviously anticipated fast, great service and food. Our waitress was very nice, I think her name is Ginger, so for customer service I give her 5 stars.  However, when it comes to the food, I don't know what happened!  I haven't dined here in almost 3 years, but when I did it use to be the go to spot for me and my former co-workers, which is why I selected it for today's outing, anticipating that the food quality and customer service would be close to if not above and beyond what I had previously experienced.  So whereas the customer service is still excellent, the food quality has suffered.  I had the calamari appetizer and it was pretty good.  However, my friend, a local very successful business owner, ordered the most expensive steak and he absolutely hated it.  He said that it tasted like it had been fried!  I don't know what happened.  Did the cook dip it in the fryer to \"warm it up\" because it was cold due to sitting too long on the line?  As I mentioned earlier the restaurant wasn't busy.  There were less than 30 customers in the restaurant, but it took almost 25 minutes from order to delivery before my guest received his meal.  I don't know what happened, but I was embarrassed to have invited him to Elephant Bar, both as his friend and co-op business owner.   I meet with and entertain clients and business associates often, and whereas I previously thought the Elephant Bar could be, once again, one of my \"go-to\" places in Henderson, today's experience has unfortunately shown me that this is not the case.  So sad... because I truly think the wait and hostess staff are excellent, but I don't know what's happened in the kitchen.  As a former co-restaurant owner/self-proclaimed \"foodie\" and ex-wife of a CIA (Culinary Institute of America) grad, good food I definitely know. Today I didn't experience that from a restaurant that I previously loved to visit.  To the management, consistency, especially in the kitchen, is the key to success or failure of a restaurant.  With the competition in this town, that is more important than ever!  Today your establishment did not live up to your previous food quality standards.  I'm hopeful that this is something that you can correct in the future."}
{"text":"Ate in the bar.  Loved the decor. Good atmosphere. Good service. Good prices. Enjoyed our ribeye sliders and lettuce wraps. I would go here again."}
{"text":"I came here the other day for lunch with my grandparents. We are a table of picky eaters and unfortunate souls with food allergies. You know, a server's DREAM TABLE. :)  Anywho, we never expect sterling service when we go out because of our dietary restrictions (we realize our orders can be time-consuming and difficult), but our experience with our server, Nancy, was amazing.  She was able to suggest certain entrees that met our dietary needs and even offered customizations to entrees so we had a larger selection to choose from. I can't get over how friendly, helpful and knowledgeable she was of the menu and certain food allergies that a lot of people aren't aware of today.  I will definitely be back and sitting in her section. :)"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I have been coming here for years (I grew up right down the street) and the service and quality of food have always been consistently fantastic. I frequent this restaurant for lunch and happy hour now since it is so close to work. I always try to sit in Nancy's section - she's friendly, takes really great care of her customers and has a lot of great menu recommendations. I have some food allergies and I am a vegetarian and she is always able to find something tasty for me whether it is on the menu or not."}
{"text":"Amazing service!! Thankyou Lucy. My boyfriend was very inpatient at first waiting for his beer but Lucy handled everything very well and then gave us extra care on top of it-- thankyou thankyou Thankyou !!"}
{"text":"Reviewing take-out only!  Called in an order for lunch, and spoke to a very nice lady over the phone. I was an hour late picking up my order and they re-made it hot for me. I consider that to be great customer service.   Lamb shank: quality meat but the meat was not marinated in advance, so it was tasteless. Rack of pork ribs - superb, no complaints here, especially that it comes with sweet potato fries! The prices are pretty good compared to Lucille's next door.  Will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Not too bad of a place.  A kind of a jungle look inside.  It wasn't too busy for a Sunday.  The server was nice.  The food took a bit longer than I thought I would have.  The food's above average.  My friend ordered a Philly Cheesesteak which I took a bite out of.  Not the greatest Philly Cheese I've eaten, but edible at the least.  I got the Lo'Carb Lemon-Herb chicken which was cooked very well.  My other friend go the Fire-grilled beef tri tip with shrimp.  Not too bad, but I didn't think any of the food was outstanding.  The pricing isn't bad though.  Not a place I'd go out of the way for, but I wouldn't mind stopping by either if I was hungry."}
{"text":"Good food and good service, they have some tasty alcoholic beverages if it suits your fancy. Shrimp jambalaya was good along with shrimp plates and delicious appetizers and desserts."}
{"text":"I am quite shocked at how low of a review the Elephant Bar got on yelp  (Agreeing with Dennis T who also made the same comment).  It's pretty much your typical American restaurant and I am going to compare this restaurant to other American restaurants I have been to!  That's pretty much how it goes right?  I mean I cannot be comparing this restaurant to...let's say...Buchon at the Venetian....cause that's just ridiculous!  Being an American non-fine-dining restaurant, this is a great place to go with friends!    If it wasn't for the gift certificate I got, I may not even have stopped in here to dine at all!  It must have been fate! ;-) They have an awesome happy hour special!  Great food and drinks!  And on top of that our waitress was awesome!  Loved her!  Made some great recommendations and my friends and I all had a great time!    I pretty much tried all of the appetizers on the happy hour menu and I cannot remember any of them being disappointing...in fact I wanted more!  We even ordered the Jambalya, which was decent!  It could have been more spicier to give it that southern kick, but the flavor was there!    If you are in the Green Valley area and is looking for a place to have a good time during happy hour, check this place out!  Good food, good drinks, sounds like HAPPY hour to me! =)"}
{"text":"My friends and I show up weekly, we receive amazing service and the cocktail servers remember us and our choice drinks each time:) great service and great atmosphere. In addition this restaurant is located in a beautiful outdoor area that is enjoyable to walk around!:)"}
{"text":"This place is right across the street from the Peoria Sports complex....We were there to watch some Mariners Spring Training games. The YELP map puts this place in the wrong place on the map....  GREAT food and they have very reasonable prices as well, HOW weird! When does that happen? I loved the bar, but they really need to get some flat screens in there that are better (easier to see and watch)...We were trying to watch the Final Four first and second round but we finally left to get a better view at another sports bar nearby...."}
{"text":"Best creme brulee ever! :-) when I go here I get the half rack of ribs and the creme brulee, they also have great garlic bread as an appetizer. I do feel that it's a little pricey though and the ribs are definitely not the best I've had (especially with lucilles nearby)"}
{"text":"Ill give them 3 stars because the manager did call me and followed up with me after I post my review and apologize for everything.   I can tell he is good management. And yes my first experience sucked but the food was good I will be trying it again. Giving them another chance.   I will be updating my Yelp review.  I guess he told everyone what happened because they knew who I was. And I'm ok with that. That's how people learn. We are all human we make mistakes. Saying I'm sorry sometimes is all we need to hear. Thank you   Updating my stars Joe our server was extremely nice had my food I was taking to go ready when I was done eating my food was amazing came by to check on us. Glad I came back even the girl in the front was nice and made conversation   Awesome job everyone I definitely had a great 2nd experience.  One of the best restaurants!"}
{"text":"We got a gift certificate to this restaurant, so I guess we were obligated to go.  I hate wasting someone else's money.  We had the Vietnamese Spring Rolls for appetizers.  It's a commercialized Americanized version of Goi Cuon, a traditional Vietnamese dish.  It was okay--not good, not bad, not what I expected and hoped for unfortunately.  But I wasn't at a Vietnamese restaurant, so I had to dial down my expectations there.  The menu is immense.  Probably way too big.  That's probably some of the difficulty we had in this restaurant.  Our extremely attentive waiter had to come back 3 times before taking our order because it took us that long to figure out what our kids wanted and then what we wanted.  I had the Bangkok Pad Thai with Shrimp.  Shrimp was slightly undercooked, not particularly good.  The noodles were Americanized, not very hot though I asked for extra \"heat\", and were just \"meh\".   The tofu in it was very good though.  At least I hope it was tofu.  You can just never tell.  My wife had the Ultimate Bacon Cheeseburger.  The bun was very greasy, so she only ended up eating the contents.  It was okay, standard sit-down restaurant burger.  One son had New York steak.  Cooked to order (not undercooked as is common), and a nice cut of meat.  Not bad.  Other son had Crispy Teriyaki Chicken.  It was okay--nothing super special.  But it wasn't bad, and he ate much of it.  He's a very picky eater typically.  Overall, I'd put this restaurant in the category of \"Chili's\" and \"Outback Steakhouse\".  Good for families and large groups, not very intimate.  The service was impeccable though.  The server here for us was probably the best restaurant service that we've had in years.  So kudos to that!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service but VERY LOUD!  I like this place a lot when you can go in and it is not bursting at the seams.  It needs some soft surfaces so that you can hear the people you are with but the food is always good.  There have been times that I got the wrong order and it was because the server could not hear me either.  They have always made it right for us.  The Creme Brule' is amazing.  Kids love it because of the animals in the lobby and parents love it because the kids can be loud.  They serve ice cream with the kids meals so they love that and the parents probably have kids bouncing off the walls all night. :)"}
{"text":"By far the worst calamari I have ever had. Spinach artichoke dip tasted gross. Appetizer sampler was not worth it. Only thing that tasted alright was the coconut shrimp. For entree I had orange peel chicken and that was okay. To be honest everything was overpriced for what it is so I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Yummy!! This place was so good! I ordered a shrimp platter and everything was so tasty! Best shrimp I have ever had! Great menu and service was excellent also! I will be back!"}
{"text":"We had an experience similar to \"Rich M\" below, I'm guessing we had the same waitress/bartender. We came in on a Tuesday night, the bar was sort of busy but had no trouble finding an empty table. It took about 5 minutes to get a menu and then another 10 before we placed our drink order. The drinks came handily and we ordered food: an appetizer and a pub burger.  After about 25 minutes waiting, we asked the bartender if she could check on our appetizer, as we had wanted to pick on it with our beer while we waited for our food. She said she would check. When she left the bar, she made a circle around the entire bar, picking up dirty dishes as she went. Another patron asked her for \"another beer\" which she promptly poured and delivered to him... all while we were still waiting for her to \"check\" on our appetizer, which she then did.  When she came back she said that she told them in the kitchen to send out the app first. \"FIRST?\" I asked, having expected them about 10 minutes ago. \"I don't control the food,\" she said, and walked away. Several minutes later she went back to the kitchen and came out with both the app and the main dish. \"They both came out together,\" was her response, and when I expressed my dissatisfaction she said I could speak to her manager, whom she sent over.  I explained what happened, and she offered to comp the app and bring our check right away, as we had a movie to catch. She brought the check, I put the money in it, and it sat on our table for the next 15 minutes, as our \"waitress\" ignored us the rest of the night. I finally asked the hostess to send over the manager so we could pay our bill, and eventually a DIFFERENT MANAGER came out, and he had NO IDEA what had been going on, so I had to explain it all again. When we looked at the check, we realized that the waitress had overcharged us, not giving us the \"happy hour\" prices! At this point the 2nd manager offered to comp our entire meal, and our next appetizer when we come back, which I told him was doubtful, at least for a while, and he promised to \"talk to\" the waitress.  Not once during this entire night did our waitress apologize, act remorseful, or anything other than bothered that we were there in the first place. From the moment we sat down we felt as if we were inconveniencing her and keeping her from the couple next to us, whom she chatted with very friendly, while keeping things with us very cold and nasty. Elephant bar, do yourselves a favor and get rid of this girl - you know who she is. She is costing you patrons."}
{"text":"Was sooooo disappointed with my recent visit. Hubby and I went on a Saturday night and ordered the following: Nachos with chicken Happy hour pub burger combo Philly cheesesteak meal Creme brulee (to go)  Never have i ever felt such sub-par service and quality of food from a well established restaurant, but this place seemed to do it so well. The nachos were overwhelmed with beans, hardly any cheese full of a bunch of broken over-oiled chips...the salsa tasted and smelled like it had turned. The bun used for the burger was some sort of wheat grain, i didn't even touch it. The cheesesteak sandwich was sloppy and the mashed potatoes so bland and forgettable. Neither of the meals looked appealing. Our waitress was non-existent and once we felt we were ready to go, we waited for almost 15min before she finally came to check on us. We really came for the creme brulee since this place was one of two places nearby that serves it. Never had it from here before but hubby was craving for it, so we ordered one to go.....and well, you can see for yourself how that unfolded,   the picture pretty much sums up our experience there. Elephant Bar is such an easy pass next time....this place is dead to me."}
{"text":"Honestly, my last experience here was awful but this time I was truly redeemed. I love the food at Elephant bar and love the drinks. The food is what makes the restaurant unique and amazing. I love ordering the Spinach and Artichoke Dip and the Green Beans they are my favorite. The service is fast depending on what server you get at the restaurant. It seems like all the amazing servers have left the restaurant and everyone else is brand new. I will be going back for sure and I am glad they redeemed my customer service. I love elephant bar and think it is an amazing restaurant and anybody should try it. You will love the food and the energy from the restaurant. I honestly think also making the District have open parking and redoing the area was a smart decision."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely great the food the service and the atmosphere our server Susana had really great suggestions and a great personality and was extremely helpful"}
{"text":"**DISCLAIMER** I rate only on the quality and consistency of the Coconut Shrimp  Chain Schmain! If you know what to order you'll be fine.  They have a pretty extensive Polynesian inspired menu. Stay away from all that and go for the good stuff~   COCONUT SHRIMP ~Quite Possibly the best (see pics)  Their Tempura Salmon roll is pretty good too but can vary, this time it was a little over riced and the rice was on the sticky side, but it was still tasty.  I Only go here to eat those two items and occasionally their mini sundae which is super fab!   A scoop of vanilla ice cream set inside a crispy cinnamon sugar wonton bowl with chocolate sauce and whip cream! Perfection!"}
{"text":"Great place for locals. Food comes out super fast and it's delicious. Try the triple smoked burger. Also, ask for Danielle! She's personable and friendly. Makes u feel at home !"}
{"text":"Taste is pretty tasty!   Took some friends to this place and they got drunk!  Those margaritas hit hard.  Food is very good.  Kind of like an asian, cajun, american mix.  I had the jumbiliya.  Pretty damm good.  Service was great.  Chica was over nice to me and I felt it was a duty to tip well.  High class, but good pricing.  cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Although Elephant Bar is a chain restaurant it is one that you shouldn't miss out on a chance to eat.   They are constantly updating the menu and offering seasonal and holiday centered promotions.    I'm a huge fan of this location because it is easy to get to and is never too busy to handle.  The staff at this location is awesome and they really go out of your way to make sure that you are attended to.     It's definitely a place you could take your kids to.   My eight year-old had a great time.   Of the many restaurants in GVR I find this one to be one of my favorites.    It is very reasonable and portions are never an issue."}
{"text":"The be fair and balance out all the reviews of places I want people to go, I had to pick a place that I don't want anyone to go.    Granted, this place would have changed because it has been a couple years since I've been there.  So the first couple times I went there, it felt like an overpriced TGI Friday's and I really had no desire to return.  But no...  We had to do a team lunch there once.  Again, completely forgettable meal, but what I will never forget is two of the guys in my group ordered this one sampler dish.  Compared to the picture on the menu, it literally looked like they split a single portion over two plates.  After taking forever, and then not seeming two concerned when one of my friends said, \"I didn't order the kid's portion.\"  We still laugh and make jokes about this place.  With all the better places around the area, I'm surprised it is still in business."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. We were seated right away, but it took forever for a server to get to our table and 15-20 min to get water! It took almost an hour to get our food and the restaurant wasn't even half full. The server recommended the fish and chips because they were hand battered, but we were not impressed when the food came to the table. The fish was completely tasteless and unseasoned."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Service was slow and unattentive. Food was lousy."}
{"text":"Much better the second time around.  Food was better.  Got the macadamia nut crusted chicken with rice, tropical salsa, and wasabi sauce.  Service was good cuz I showed up around 5, so the place was pretty empty.  I'll go back.  Not first choice, but a good choice."}
{"text":"Some of us met here for drinks and with it being Wednesday, they offer 5 wine on all of their selections. One cannot beat 5 wine, so I decided to try a white wine why it was on the fruity side; was very delicious. They offer great deals on appetizers that usually are $10-12 are only $6. What a deal? I ended up trying the bruschetta and toast which was so good. The way the spinach was prepared was so well done. I tried their potato wedges which are so cheesy that it is running over the potato's with bacon pieces all around.  I ended up taking food to go since the appetizers were so filling . For the main dinner plate I ordered the 10 oz steak which comes with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. Had to experience dessert too which I ordered strawberry cheesecake, and it even came with an Oreo crust. It was so rich that I could not even eat all of it in one setting. The steak was cooked to perfection and was so moist and thick. The service kind of lacked while we were eating there and a manager walking by noticed that we were ready to go and checked us out, but our server was the only waitress for the bar and patio area. We did not hold it against her. The Elephant Bar is such a beautiful restaurant with great art all over the place that you can experience and eat well too."}
{"text":"I come here all the time with my boyfriend and friends for their happy hour- it is awesome!   Sad to see the buffalo chicken tenders off the HH menu, but good opportunity for us to try something new. The potato skins with buffalo chicken is very good and filling. It's only $1 more to add the chicken, and you'll get lots of it. What a steal! Please keep it like that.  The green tea cooler and Moscow mule is really good as well! My boyfriend loves how there's a piece of ginger candy on the drink.  Sweet potato fries are consistently great.  Service is consistently great.  I've never had to wait in line for HH, there's always a spot open at the bar area. Happy hour here is the best!!"}
{"text":"Parmesan crusted green beans: YES Potstickers: decent. (I'm usually not a potsticker fan so don't take it personal) Service: good Feeling like you're dining in a jungle: YES! I ordered the honey shrimp dish with friend rice. Enough for plenty of leftovers and very delicious."}
{"text":"My partner and I have been to Elephant Bar many times, and it never disappoints.  You walk in and are immediately struck by the warm, safari-esque decor.  Giant palm frond fans twirl lazily above, while a cool blue backlit ceiling dominates the heavy wood fixtures.  This time, we went straight into the bar and camped out in one of the over-sized booths.  The restaurant was not as busy as I remember it in the past, and we were there at about 5 pm on a Saturday.  Still, there was a good crowd.    Our service was impeccable, as the servers were very attentive and efficient.  The food came out fast.  Since it was happy hour, we ordered a bunch of their discounted appetizers.  Sometimes we like doing \"picky food\" as we call it.  We started with the coconut shrimp skewers and the butterflied fried shimp with cocktail sauce.  Both were elegantly served and very tasty, perfectly cooked and quite enjoyable.  The sauce had a nice little kick to it, without being too hot or bland.  Next, we moved on to the Vietnamese spring rolls, which unfortunately were chilled and a little weird, stuffed with shrimp and vegetables.  They were almost a little jiggly, and as I have texture issues with food, I had to be careful here.  The peanut sauce served on the side was tasty and saved the day for me, but I would have preferred the spring rolls cooked, as I'm not a fan of sushi and this sort of reminded me of that.  The vegetable relish in the middle of the spring rolls plate was pretty good, though.    Next, we shared the hummus, which was also very tasty.  We did run out of the hard pita chips (I would have preferred soft pita but that's just me), but it was so good I finished off the hummus with my fork and practically licked the plate, until my partner slapped me up side the head and told me to stop being a pig.  Finally, I ordered the $3.50 tomato soup, which came looking somewhat oily and liberally laced with sour cream.  It tasted really good, despite the oily appearance, and it was quickly scarfed up.  With beer, our total for all of this was under $30, so I'd say it was mission accomplished in spades.  The prices are reasonable and the food portions are ample but not gargantuan.  Overall, I give this a B+.  Good service helped ticked that up a notch, and we will be back.  Go here, go often, and have fun."}
{"text":"This is a great place.  I never knew it was a chain when I went here!  I came in, and was kinda of reminded a little bit of Rainforest Cafe, but it has a litte more mature feeling then Rainforest (even though I really love Rainforest).    The food here was good, service was even better.  Everyone was very friendly and not too pushy.  If I am every in the Glendale area again, I will come in again!"}
{"text":"Elephant Bar fell off my radar after multiple visits where we received progressively bad service... The last visit being one where we walked out without eating due to total incompetence by the wait staff. So when my husband suggested we have dinner at Elephant Bar after doing some shopping, I was a little hesitant, but since I did enjoy the food on prior visits where we got to eat, I agreed to go.   The host was very friendly, he offered us the option of sitting at a table, booth or in the bar area so that we could watch the game. Our waitress came by shortly afterward to take our drink order.  For our entrees, both my husband and I decided to order off the special menu. I went with the Pacific Cove Tropical Crab and Shrimp Louie ($14.25). I was in the mood for both seafood and a salad, so this was perfect. The grilled pineapple and mango were nice compliments to the sweet clumps of crab and pieces of shrimp. My only disappointment was that dressing was served on the side, and drizzled on the salad, I would have preferred it all on the side.   My husband went with the Mongolian Beef, a dish he enjoys at many places. He was offered a choice of white, brown or fried rice... Always nice when you are given options like this. When his food arrived, I immediately thought \"That's it?\" What a small serving. My husband enjoyed the food but it was not enough to fill him up and at $14.50, it was overpriced for the portion received.   The service we received was better then previous visits, obviously, we stayed this time...  Our waitress was still rather mundane. She always seemed like she was in a hurry despite the restaurant being fairly slow, and I don't think I saw her smile once.   Elephant Bar is back on my radar, but I am not in a big hurry to return."}
{"text":"The food was only slightly above average. Decent prices and very cool decor but not sure I would make this a regular spot. We also told our server it was my birthday and nothing was done or said to acknowledge that. Kinda disappointed by that"}
{"text":"I like this place for lunch.  Bar food it may be, but it is some of my favorite bar food around.  Could use more elephants."}
{"text":"Updated review. Been here 3 times recently and the food drinks and service has been top notch. They have a fantastic happy hour menu in the bar area. One of the specials is their signature burger and a pint of beer for like 6$ or upgrade to an import or craft beer for another 1$ . Love this place."}
{"text":"Great for a late lunch or dinner plus you can easily turn the vegetarian options into vegan ones (though I highly recommend asking for the Mongolian beef with extra veg and no animal - so good!). Staff is always very friendly and the bartenders make a mean bourbon mule!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Great service Danielle was a queen of service!! Come to this place yall"}
{"text":"Elephant Bar is a great restaurant option at The District. I've dined here several times and never had a negative experience. Friendly servers and it's on Open Table! Ordered Mongolian beef for the first time, pleasantly surprised, it's good. With so many options at The District, EB has great variety of dishes. Something for everyone."}
{"text":"I just don't care for this Elephant Bar for some reason, the Elephant Bar in LA tastes alot better than this one. My parents like coming here so on several occations I have tried different things and there wasn't one that I liked. I like how alot of their stuff looks in their menu but once you taste them it's not good. The food is either too salty or too bland, there is never a happy medium between the two. I have never been served something hot-It's funny I see the food ready to serve to us but it's just never hot. I would not come here if I was paying..."}
{"text":"So the other night, my family and I went to the Elephant Bar after it had been several years since our last visit.  My grandma was in town for a visit and was dying to go when she found out that we still have a location open here in the Vegas Valley.  All the restaurants in SoCal are no more and so she cannot dine as she used to.  On Tuesday evevning we headed down to the District which seems to be thriving as a whole.  The Elephant Bar seemed to be doing pretty well too.  There was a good crowd for an early week night.  Despite the busy restaurant, we were seated right away and greeted promptly by our server.  He brought up some water while we looked over the menu and decided first on some drinks.  Grandma got a sangria roja.  My dad got a tall Bud Light.  I had a mai tai.  I don't know how much alcohol was in these drinks.  Probably not much but they tasted good regardless.  For the food, I think it took my grandma and me the longest to decide.  My grandma wanted a dish with shrimp only but could only find shrimp and chicken dishes.  The waiter offered double shrimp in place of the chicken and that made up her mind.  She got what seemed to be pasta with marinara and shrimp.  I was the final hold out and ordered the wood-fired tri tip and hoisin BBQ grilled chicken.  It was flavorful but perhaps too saucey for my liking.  But I had no issue in eating it and did not complain about a thing.  The beef was tender and the chicken strongly herbed.  The mashed potatoes were dense but softened well when mixed with the BBQ sauce from the chicken.  The fresh sprig of rosemary in the potatoes was a nice arromatic touch.  Though I liked my meal just fine, I was disappointed in one aspect of the evening.  The fact that the Elephant Bar does not carry the dish I used to get from there any more.  It was a big bowl of noodle soup with their Pan Asian chicken skewers.  That was a favorite of mine from almost any restaurant.  I saw the Pan Asian chicken on the appetizer section of the menu but they were served over vegetables rather than soup.  That just was not going to cut it.  It was the combination that I enjoyed.  Too bad they did away with it.  My dad was much more pleased with his Mongolian beef and would like to start going to Elephant Bar again now that it is fresh in his memory as a place he rather likes.  I guess I know what I am getting him for Christmas."}
{"text":"Located in The District, the Elephant Bar seems like a good place to stop off for a bite.  We walked in around 7 on a Friday night and was promptly seated.  About 10 minutes later our waitress came over and took our drink orders, I asked for kids menu since there isn't one on the regular menu.  About 10 minutes later she returns with the paper placemat of a kids menu and takes our drink order.  Another 10  minutes she returns with the drinks and asks for our order. She was quite friendly, but throughout the meal the service was SLOW.  3 kids meals and a salad and shared dessert took almost 2 hours!!  Top the molasses slow turnover time was the poor quality of the food. I ordered the Thai Chicken Salad. The chicken cubes were hard, dry and tough. The salad consisted of lettuce, loose, limp, soggy cucumber slices, bits of Chinese won ton strips,  and 3-4 julienned carrots. Two of the three kids I had with me ordered the kids hamburgers which they reported as super salty. The French fries that accompanied the burgers were good. The other child with us ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl with she said was fair, nothing spectacular. Trying to salvage the meal we ordered desserts to be shared. One ice cream (mocha) pie, huge, to be shared by 2-3 people, and very good. The chocolate chip cookie bake with a scoop of ice cream was brought severely over baked and dry. The Wonton  ice cream sundae was considered very tasty.  Total bill minus tip, $63 and change.  Service, very friendly, but very slow.  Atmosphere, clean, nice, good for families or friends.  Due to the poor quality of good I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and a friendly staff.  The food is good but nothing I've ate here has made me say \"I want to come back again just for this\".    I've been to this location about ten times since I've lived in Vegas and each time I can't figure out what kind of restaurant this is exactly?  They seem to be serving more Asian food choices than anything.  I guess there are elephants in Asia but the decor suggest a more African vibe.  I wouldn't call it eclectic because it really doesn't have any commonly neutral foods on the menu like sandwiches, pastas or soups.  This is a weird note but it also reminds me of the 1990's for some reason."}
{"text":"2nd visit under new management did not care well. Happy hour drinks were Ok food was cold and poorly prepared. Can only assume different chef was on duty. But spending$40 for two at Happy Hour for a poor performance has taken this location off our list."}
{"text":"Our family of 4 love it here, it is our new regular favorite restaurant. The wait staff is awesome, food is excellent, and their prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Ok I have to say this place is pretty good at first glance. I am not sure if this is a local chain or just local.    It has a cool jungle feel that matches it's name. The menu is two sided half American half world flare.   I was seated in the bar which can be hit or miss but I have to say the bartender was friendly and stayed on top of her tables.   I ordered a White whiskey old fashioned that was strong and tasty. Not the best I have ever had but good none the less.   Ordered pot roast with a side of extra veggies. I skipped lunch so I needed something extra ha.   I would come here and recommend it. Nice people, fair prices and good drinks and food"}
{"text":"Let's start from the top - the decor is nice. It's comfortable, clean and has a consistent theme.  Service...attentive though a little...awkward. He seemed to want to be our buddy a little too much. Don't get me wrong, he got our orders right, was prompt, refilled our drinks, even ASKED if he could refill my iced tea, which I appreciated, but somehow seemed a little incongruent to the restaurant.  Hard to explain. He may have been new there as he wasn't expert on the menu. Still...A for effort.  He did a good job trying to encourage us for dessert (which we ultimately declined).  The food was fine. I had the Philly Cheese Steak. Portion size was good, may have been slightly under-seasoned. French fries were quite good.  Good value for money.  I thought it was curious that they served burgers and sandwiches...and asian/wok cuisine.  I was briefly tempted to add a side of fried rice to my Philly but ultimately passed.  There is no breakfast menu."}
{"text":"A let down of bad food with great menu descriptions. The happy hour here is a great deal and their cocktails, especially Mai Tai, are delicious.   Food, however, is overcooked and badly seasoned. Potato skins are cut into spears and this caused the skins to be crusty and hard to the point of stale-like quality. Only the middles of the spears were edible. The  melted cheese mixture was too mild and lacked flavor. They came with ranch, not sour cream?They were OK for $3 off. The coconut shrimp skewers, unfortunately, were disgusting. Very small, burnt, and no flavor. Not to mention they are one shrimp per skewer and this means 4 small shrimp total. Very upsetting. They are rested atop a pool of sweet-n-sour sauce and wonton strips??The sauce didn't accompany the shrimp at all and with burnt coconut, even less appealing.   The entrees were also disappointing. Misoyaki salmon was not tasty or appealing to the eye. For a full-flavored fish like salmon, this had a VERY pale pink color and tasted more like chicken. The glaze was not reminiscent of miso at all and clearly put on the fish too early in the cooking process such that it developed a burnt taste by the time the fish was finished grilling. Not palatable. The vegetables underneath the fish filet were cut too thin and thus became soggy. Soggy squash is disgusting, especially unseasoned, soggy squash. The mashed potatoes, instead of rice, were supposed to be garlic mashed but the garlic was nonexistent. The potatoes also were not homemade and if they were, water was added to them instead of milk. Had a baby food quality. Again, no salt or pepper.   The stir fry is a poor attempt at one and the Cobb salad came with bacon jam spread on toast instead of croutons?? Take a guess about the bacon jam....inedible.   Dessert to go was the gooey butter cake. This was not a butter cake but rather a yellow cake, possibly boxed, with a teaspoon of toffee sauce drizzled on top and RAW? pear slices. The toffee sauce was a \"bourbon\" toffee sauce. No bourbon detected at all. Shocking.    Needless to say, it's not worth coming here unless it's for happy hour and you want to wash down average appetizers with a strong drink. Probably not a return spot....."}
{"text":"OMG WE LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! The manager Zoltan was SUPER nice and our server Roi was such a nice guy. Great recommendations on the food and Happy Hour was FRIGGIN WOOOOWWWW!!! We sat outside and all the servers were gracious of our sleeping baby. It's a great atmosphere to relax and the menu is broad... All I can say is TRY the Calamari, and the Lamb Shanks are HUGE... A bang for your buck... And if you order the mud pie... Share it!!! It's more of a mountain size!!! Lol!!! Thanks guys, well be back!!!"}
{"text":"Just left the restaurant where a group of friends and I met up for dinner and drinks. Our server, Danielle was super sweet and attentive to our group. She broke down both the happy hour menu and the regular menu, clarifying any questions we had. The food, drinks, and supporting staff were all fantastic. Thanks for a great night!"}
{"text":"I was always a big fan of the elephant bar, they had such a variety and so many good dishes to choose from. I'm not sure if they had to do budget cuts or what but I went there for mine and my sister's birthday and kind of disappointed. They completely changed the menu, they're so big they look like you're holding a giant clipboard like a coach at a football game. And completely different dishes, wasn't a fan of the new food. I miss the coconut and pineapple shrimp mmmm!"}
{"text":"Sunday evenings must be the day they schedule employees who have performance issues to work. Server was slow and seemed to be in a bad mood, chicken I ordered had strange metallic taste. Nicely asked for it to be sent back and the server said, \"well it is Moroccan\" and while removing the plate, did not even try to hide her annoyance. Next time will go to another District restaurant,"}
{"text":"This was the first time we ate at this location (been to the DC, CA in Serramonte, on several occasions). I'd say 3.5 stars. The nervous server was new at this, and you could tell, because he kept messing up our order. Ok, after he admitted it, we felt bad for him, so we didn't want to give him a hard time.   What I ordered was very good: the smokehouse sandwich, chicken, lettuce, tomato, BBQ sauce, cheese, and onion strings on a bun (similar to Red Robin). It was a little messy, though. I usually hate messy, but it was so good, I dismissed it. My husband ordered the Philly but found the peppers were a little too spicy for him (he asked the server before ordering, if the peppers were mild or hot), so we ended up splitting. I didn't taste it until I ditched some of the bread. My FIL also ordered the Philly without mushrooms and hot peppers, and didn't like the heat, either, but ate it anyway, because he thought he could ignore it, if he ate it fast enough. His wife, had the Pastrami on a roll; it came with coleslaw but it wasn't overleaded with it, and the meat was lean, too. We also ordered the appetizer combo, which came after our entrees: artichoke and spinach dip with chips, chicken tenders (panko), shrimp (also in panko), and bruschetta slices. I didn't like the dip, it was overly thick for me, but my husband and my FIL dug in. The shrimp and chicken was really good, but everything was getting a little too heavy for me. I had to stop eating.   I like the ambiance (fun jungle theme), the food concept (world fusion), and the circular bar in the middle front of the dining area. This place was busy; there was a steady influx of patrons. It's a popular place.    Maybe our experience might have been better if our server wasn't so new; he did apologize, though. My FIL and his wife had eaten here a couple years back, and didn't like it. My husband and I thought the one in Daly City was better."}
{"text":"Disappointed, went here for a birthday luncheon & although the hostess was not rude, she was not welcoming.  The food was very disappointing, had the seafood trio from the specialty menu, was dry, flavorless & veggies were oily - presentation looked nothing like the picture on the menu.  The looks of my friend's salad she ordered was not appetizing looking.  Service was good, but not outstanding, Server did not offer a birthday dessert or even a candle on the desserts that were ordered for the birthday person.  Lack luster - will not frequent this place."}
{"text":"Good food and service.  Convenient to the mall after a hard day of shopping."}
{"text":"I've always thought the decor and atmosphere was fun and yet somewhat cozy at Elephant Bar, and the food was pretty decent--nothing to write home about--but decent. However, I had their Chicken Marsala yesterday which is chicken stuffed with whatever it's stuffed with, mashed potatoes and gravy and I can say it is really mmmm mmmmm good!  I loved it!  In fact, I refrained from licking the plate, which is what I would have loved to do it was so darn good. Frankly, I've never really had anything there that was bad...just nothing that was superior.  But I do like that Chicken Marsala plate alot. As Ahnold says, \"I'll be back.\""}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. The pot stickers and sweet potato fries were the best!  The service was awesome!  Cody the manager was super, he came to our table to ask about our meal! Love the personal feel and extra attention from the manager!! I will be back again and again!!!"}
{"text":"We experience consistently good food and great service. Jamie was very attentive today. You've got to try this place. You won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"HORRRRIBLE!!!  Went to a retirement party for a co-worker.   Large party of 25 people.   They started out with three servers working our tables, but that dwindled down to 1 and 1/2 servers.  Three of us NEVER GOT OUR ORDERS and no server even noticed or cared.    Worst service we have seen in years.  We had to BEG to get them to bring our food.    And when they did - the quality was fair at best.   We complained vehemently to the manager, and she graciously comp'd us on our meal - FOOD ONLY!!!  We still had to pay for our drinks, which were barely ever refilled.   OHHH - and Jungle Collada or whatever ever it was, had ZERO, ZIP, NADA alcohol in it!!!!   All I can say is this - Everyone that extolls the virtues of this place either has pathetically low expectations these days (as we are taught to expect that), or they are a shill commenter for this dive. Go somewhere else people, and learn to demand better."}
{"text":"ordered the steak sandwich (medium rare).  Came out cooked medium.  Still very delicious.  French fries were not good, way too salty.  Server seemed as though he did not want to be there, with a grouchy attitude."}
{"text":"It's really hit or miss with this place. I've been 3 times in the last 6 months (with out of town business visitors and co-workers) and each time it's just okay, but the service is usually slow even when it's not busy. I went a couple weeks ago and the food was bland and our waiter chatted away a few rows down while we waited for him to come and refill drinks and get extra dressing for our salads.  Get something other than their salads too...not real tasty. The bacon was chewy (not crispy) and do not get the fat free dressing....it's runny and flavorless. I have tried some of the other food and it's okay, not really some place I choose to go, but if others are going, I will go with them. The atmosphere is nice and different and the iced tea is good and fresh."}
{"text":"What a super Sunday, glad I stopped by.  The bartenders at Elephant Bar Chandler really know how to show you a good time.  Brian was really personable, but Miki was my favorite.  I had the salmon roll with a glass of Malbec off the happy hour menu.  I'm a seafood kind of guy myself, and the salmon was so pink!   Quality service, tasty food, exciting atmosphere... I'll be back for more, you can count on that."}
{"text":"dined here two years ago - was much better.  \"happy hour pub burger\": bleh.   - asked for medium rare, served medium well - bread felt and tasted on the stale side - burger was cooked on a griddle with weird flavors to it.  maybe they pre-made the burger and kept it in water.. to flash back on the griddle....something was a little off.   - fries were undercooked.  ** brought it up to the bartender..got the \"sure, I'll tell them\", but after a beer and a half, nothing.    - happy hour prices went up.  hey, slow means price hikes..not a lot of people at all for a Thurs happy hour."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar for happy hour. Had the hamburger, fries, and domestic beer for 6.95. The Burger was nice and tasty. The bar wasn't full so service was quick and efficient. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I would say the Elephant Bar is great for happy hour... Pretty good Happy hour prices for drinks great to meet people for drinks to discuss where you really want to eat dinner."}
{"text":"We frequent Elephant Bar in Henderson about once a week. The employees are always friendly and professional. The food is prepared very well and timely. Danielle does a great with making sure we have everything we need. Great service.  Had dinner on the 22nd. The food was great. Lucy did a great job as always."}
{"text":"Always intrigued by the name, but there's really nothing special about Elephant Bar. I didn't like the mix of food themes and cultures, because to me it says, \"we don't specialize in anything, so we'll just give you a variety of what we THINK you'll like.\" not much of a stand out off-the-Strip-restaurant."}
{"text":"I like the place. I liked the menu better 3-4 years ago. Now they have changed the menu, removed good items and added all the Asian Fusion. I can still find what to eat if we go just for drinks/happy hour or for a lunch, but I won't go for dinner - they don't have anymore my favorite entrees."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time last Sunday because I received a GC. feeling a bit skeptical due to all the negative reviews...  First of all, the staff is very friendly. Prompt and nice... But that's about the only thing that was great.   I had ordered a Ginger Calamari, Misoyaki Salmon, & Macau Shrimp and noodle soup with Salmon...  The calamari was very salty I didnt need the dipping sauce... My Misoyaki Salmon and Macau Shrimp and noodle soup with Salmon was so bland...   Worst of all my Misoyaki salmon still had a piece of wax paper grilled on to the bottom of my salmon they had failed to take off.   When I let the server know... He talked to the manager and decided that they will take off the appetizer off our bill...??? $16.50 Salmon =$9.50 Calamari (is that even?)   I honestly did not complain to take things off the bill because I rather use up all my $100 GC and never come back here... But it made me a little upset how he handle the situation.   Anyways, overall server was very nice so I give them 2 Star."}
{"text":"Have gone there regularly for several years, but the last time they had a new - and higher priced - menu.  A couple of us ordered salads for $14-16 each and were so disappointed that they were mostly greens with just a small amount of whatever were the toppings.  Way way too expensive for the little bit of stuff that was in it.  Another friend's fries were cold, but they did replace them.  Not likely to be going back there any time soon."}
{"text":"Came in for an appetizer and my free birthday dessert which all tasted great. I got the mammoth appetizer, 2 mai tia and apple blueberry cobbler for dessert. I have been here before and the food has tasted great consistently. It was also happy hour so I got $2 off of my cocktail. Overall I think this is a great spot with good food and drinks."}
{"text":"Oh man, I have a huge soft spot for restaurants with crazy over-the-top decor.  The place looks like Africa threw up on it.  Leopard-print carpet (nice!), giant elephant & giraffe statues, piles of old-timey traveling trunks--Elephant Bar has got it all and more.    Service is fantastic--very friendly and cheeky.  The food is pretty good--nothing special, but reliable.  You go here to revel in the gleefully cheesy decor and knock back a few, not to have a mind-blowing dining experience."}
{"text":"Umm Happy hour! Yes.... I don't think I've ever been here any other time than for happy hour....So it's the only thing I can judge it on. I'm a fan of the inexpensive food and drinks.  Strange man hitting on me at the bar... well I'll let it slide cause that can happen pretty much anywhere, people always seem to want to randomly talk to me.   I highly recommend happy hour here, but you may have to stalk out a seat at the bar, it gets super packed some nights."}
{"text":"For a chainy place this was good.  Went there for lunch today. It was not bad at all. Sure its a chain, but does it really matter? Their menu is somewhat interesting. Most items have some kind of finicky twist to them. Service was good and ice tea was cold.  It could be cheaper or more interesting but its pretty good as is. Gotta try something new, right?  \"I like\""}
{"text":"We love the food here 'cause it tasty and affordable. The place was packed and we had to wait about 30 minutes even though they told us 15-20 minutes.  We started off with wedge salad which was okay. My daughter, had the Classic French dip and substituted the french fries for the 'wedge salad'. My wife had the Wok-Fired Mongolian Beef with fried rice. She ate half and brought the rest home of dinner the next night. I had the Shrimp Scampi in lobster sauce which came with linguini style pasta. There was plenty of shrimp and for me, too much sauce. I couldn't taste any lobster in the sauce.   The service was good especially on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"This is an odd place. Elephants everywhere inside (hence the name), out in the Kierland area, so it's part of the 'mall scene', of which I'm not a fan. The beer list is rather small, but the menu itself has a great deal of options.  I had the Ahi Tuna Salad and is was well done.  Tons of greens and a decent portion of Tuna which was prepared well.  The 'salad' was primarily greens with nothing more, but the dressing was nice.  This is a mediocre place out in the mall area. Was it outstanding? No. Was it fine for what it is? Yes."}
{"text":"I always love coming here there food is creative and fresh. I have always had good service and there rewards program is worth signing up for."}
{"text":"great cold salad (crab and shrimp louie). excellent happy hour drink specials. stay away from anything cooked, fried or with a sauce.  GARDE MANGER -- YOU GO GIRL! --excellent crab and shrimp louie. kudos to garde manger! --watercress, arugula and pear salad. nice flavor mix, great choice.  AVOID ANYTHING COOKED, FRIED OR WITH A SAUCE. --sweet potato fries absolutely uninteresting, even with the ketchup cocktail sauce that came with them. --chicken medallions (from frozen microwave bag) laden with chemicals, resembles a piece of chicken, but better served out of the sliding door of star trek: original series' food dispenser. YUCK. --shrimp tempura roll served on globalthermonuclear-hot plate. didn't realize you could burn dried seaweed.  MENU GOES ON AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ON AND ON ...once you get past the _30 page_ main menu... with pictures..., double-sided specials and desserts menu and triangle stand-up drinks specials menu (what?!), you might think you were in one of the infamous chinese high-rise restaurants featuring 500 or more items cooked on multiple floors. move over, cheesecake factory: your spiral bound book has nothing on e-bar!  SIGHTS, SOUNDS AND SMELLS be careful not to sit next to the kitchen. noisy! i don't remember plate clanking so loud since Roy's Scottsdale. I think they actually had a position called \"plate clanker\" back then.  today's visit had its olfactory surprises as well. raw sewage smell from the bathrooms. EW.  the slowly waving ceiling fans, elephant wall and the curvy monochrome of the booths, all laid out in a row reminds me of the Indiana Jones Safari Disneyland ride... you know, the one where you're riding in a hummer.  ugh.corporate cookie cutter restaurant chains: bite the dust!"}
{"text":"Looking for some good food, we went to the Elephant Bar hoping it had less of a chain feel than, say, PF Changs. Disappointed.  The waitress (who was really nice) suggested the calamari as an app because it's her favorite. We went for it.. and were deeply disappointed. If we were back in New York, I would have sent that crap back.   Entrees were decent, I guess, but still tasted like chain fare.  Nice to look at. Drinks were ok. Food, eh. We won't be back."}
{"text":"We used to like it so much more than what it has become. It seems as though the corporate folks can't help but cut the menu down each and every time we come without paying any attention to what is popular versus what is a menu staple. It's a large part of why we don't come hardly at all anymore. Maybe it's time we just stop entirely?   Elephant Bar was someplace we used to recommend highly. No more. Such a shame, too.  Despite the menu having been pared down significantly, the quality of the food is just as good as ever. That's about the only thing that saves them in my book."}
{"text":"Would highly recommend to locals and visitors.... Make sure you ask to be seated in Chelsea's assigned area. She is very attentive, professional, kind and cares about the people she is encountering. She goes above and beyond to give customers a great experience and obviously one of the strongest members of the elephant bar team. She is always welcoming with a smile, NEVER makes you wait long for service and makes you get the full experience of a night out! I will defiantly be going back to Elephant Bar because of her and will be recommending family and friends to see her in the future!"}
{"text":"This fuckin place..... where do I start?? First of all their service is atrocious. My lady and I ordered an appetizer and 2 entrees. Our 2 drinks were maybe refilled once (I was very dehydrated when I left). Our appetizer of pot stickers arrived after our entrees were served and was ice cold. The steak tasted like what I would imagine a steak would tasted like if Slim Jim sold steaks. The Alfredo that the misses got had the blandness of licking a rock. I've had better top Ramen. The price was cheap, but so are the hot dogs at Circle K and they have more flavor. This place was so terrible that I don't even like Elephants anymore. Yes, I am booking a trip to Africa to harvest illegal ivory tusks so I can take them back to the restaurant and shove them up the chefs ass."}
{"text":"Grisly beef, small portions. Super hot/spicy food. Notified waitress that beef was grisly & unedible, also my son's Kung Pao shrimp was so hot he couldn't eat it! Waitress extremely polite and apologetic, gave them free desserts and stated manager had had several complaints that King Pao shrimp was too hot for a lot of their customers & that the cooks might of been too generous with the spices, but that customers were not notified when ordering. Just kind of laughed it off. Again, she was very polite & professional.   Notify customers if some of their dishes are too hot spice-wise. Should upgrade beef if all of their product is too grisly. Also small portions compared to picture advertised on their special menu. Very disappointing, will not return. The \"free\" desserts: one was \"complimentary\" & the other one they gave a $7 discount if you spent $25 on a meal. Brocolli was also low quality, stalks were rock-hard & florets were tiny. Would of been nice to see a manager. Will not return. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I have dined at the Elephant Bar many times.  As long as you use the Senior Discount Card the meals are a pretty good value.  However we will not be dining there again.  On our last visit I had the Thai Chicken and my husband had the Mahi Mahi.  On each dish there were vegetable sides which were mostly stems.  The same thing happened to our dining companions.  I did not complain to the waitress, because I did not want to cause a scene.  As soon as we got home I did call and spoke to the mgr on duty.  She told me the restaurant wanted their customers to be happy and she would send me a gift card for both meals.  A week passed and we received nothing.  I went to visit the restaurant again and spoke to a different mgr who was on duty.  He assured me the gift card had been mailed.  Fast Forward 3 days, still no gift card.  I called the restaurant again.  Today is Tuesday and we received a gift which was postmarked yesterday.  The problem is, the gift card is for one meal and not for two.  We will not be visiting this restaurant again.  They don't care about customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"It's been quite a few years since I've been here.  Food looked at beautiful as ever.  Went here with all of my in town family, which is 14 people.  Mom  picked up the check.  Had the shrimp and chicken Jambalaya.  It was spicy and about $15.  Can't believe this was about 1100 calories.  And this was some of their lower end caloric foods.  My son had some chicken alfredo which had near 2000 calories.  I think that was around $11-12.  My husband had the Philly Cheesesteak.  It was good and about 900 calories and around $10-11.  He said the Philly Cheesesteak at the rodeo we went to in February was better, though.  My daughter Paremesan Chicken & Shrimp Pasta, which was about $15.  This had probably around 1600 calories.  In our party of 14, it was my mom and 4 of her children and our kids.  The food looked beautiful.  The service was good.  The only reason for the 4 star instead of 5, which I would give it a 4.5 star if I could is most of the foods were very high calories.  I suppose you could eat 1/2, so it would be nice if it weren't so high in calories.  Or, maybe other restaurants have that same caloric portions, but just don't say?  Okay, I'll change it to a 5 star instead.  If I want low calories or less fat, I'll go somewhere else.  Service was really good, though.  Nice ambiance.    Lastly, my sister did get the battered fish and parmesan chips and that only had 900 calories.  My jambalaya had more calories than her fried plate.  Go figure."}
{"text":"I went to celabrate my birthday.  What a great place.  The atmosphere is so cool.  I was not sure what to have and our waitress suggested a few items.  She really knew the meun. Even when I asked about a drink, she said she had never tried it, but if I didn't like it I could send it back.  She was very attentive and checked on us offten enough.  There were three of us and we all enjoyed our meal.  I had the pot roast over mashpotatoes.  Melt in your mouth good. Our dessert of creme brulee was to die for.  When I go back and I will, I will get Amanda Arauz our server was brand new in that position and we never would have known.  She proformed like a pro and wewill aks for her again."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a large variety of food options. We went for happy hour after work and were pleasantly surprised that they were having happy hour prices all day! I don't know how frequently they do that but their regular happy hour goes until 7 which is great if you are trying to make it after work.   The happy hour food was delicious. We tried lettuce wraps, pot stickers, artichoke dip, and calamari. My favorite was the lettuce wrap. The drinks were very good too. All of us ordered a cocktail which is 2 dollars off during happy hour.   We loved their outdoor seating , it's perfect for soaking in the crisp fall weather. My only complaint is their bathrooms are very outdated compared to the rest of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for a friends birthday. I have been back a few times now and really enjoy it! It has a good atmosphere and it's fun to look around. There is a bar area, as well as traditional seating. There are a variety of options to choose from on the menu, anything from a delicious 3 cheese macaroni side, to steaks, seafood, and Asian style cuisine. It seems like a rather casual environment, but not a place I would wear sweatpants and a tank top too. Nice jeans and a dress shirt. The staff has always been very friendly, and overall the waiting staff is very attentive, but there was one occasion where I would have like a little bit more conversation/interaction. The food is great, and the prices are good too. Aside from the Steak and Seafood meals, you could easily end the night at about $20 a person for a meal, (soft) drink, and tip. They also offer specials on their website, and if you sign up with your e-mail, they will sometimes offer discounts like $5 off a purchase, and I've even received a few offers for BOGO lunch entrees. If you're in the area or are looking for dinner and a movie, or just a fun, different place to go, I would certainly recommend a trip to the Elephant Bar!"}
{"text":"Just don't go.  We went for happy hour and was a joke.  Drinks were just deplorable. Apps were ok.  Service felt more like self serve.  Save your time and money."}
{"text":"Do you enjoy grease saturated (not in a good way), subpar chain food, and being violently ill before you even have the chance to leave the restaurant?   Then by all means, hit up The Elephant Bar!   Haven't been since 2005 (dinner with my Dude's family) and 2011 (my friend had her Bachelorette Party Dinner here).   Sick within 30 minutes of eating a burger one of the first times you meet the people who are now essentially your in-laws? Not cool.   Perhaps this review is a little off seeing as it has been two years.  But yeah, never would come here of my own accord.   A star for fantastic service and another for great cocktails.   Otherwise: Avoid, avoid, avoid!"}
{"text":"When looking for a place to eat on New Years Eve my amigas and I decided on Elephant Bar for a couple reasons.  We hadn't tried it yet. They take reservations. Jungle theme?  The restaurant does have a really cool look to it. Sure maybe a little Vegas, but it's different from most places in Scottsdale so I appreciate it. Plus we all loved the life size elephant in the lobby!   The menu was a little confusing. It was very varied, but that can be a good thing. I just had fried shrimp and fries. Boring I know, but it was good. Overall everyone enjoyed their food. And the choclatini and tiramisu are also FABULOUS!   I can't wait to try this place again when it's not a huge holiday, and eat something less boring!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a LONG time. So long that I forgot all about it. But, recently it came up again, and I was really excited to go.  First of all, I will admit that what initially caught my eye about the place was the name. I love elephants...this is The Elephant Bar...what can be bad??  My husband and I were were meeting a group, and we arrived early so we sat in the bar and ordered drinks while we waited. There were 2 bartenders working and both of them (at different times) greeted us and made menu suggestions. I was impressed because the bar area was pretty full.  When it came time for dinner, Lisa was our server, and she was awesome. Sometimes when you dine in a group the service suffers, but not here, she was even on top of refills. Again, I was impressed.  The restaurant itself was nice enough. Other yelpers have pretty much nailed the decor.  I ordered the Mongolian Beef w/o mushrooms and hot peppers. It was fabulous AND they didn't mess up my special request!! I gave it an A. My husband ordered the Ribeye Sandwich & the Mac N' Cheese. The Mac N' Cheese was visibly dry, but overall he gave it a B+.  Others in our group ordered the pear salad, which looked beautiful, the Orange Chicken which I was told \"was good, but not very orange-y\".  My only regret is that I did not leave room for dessert!! Some of them looked pretty amazing!!  Overall, I was not disappointed with The Elephant Bar. I was most impressed with the great service, but the food was very good too. I am rarely in the Green Valley area, but I would definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"If you are looking for great food and a fun atmosphere I definitely recommend this place. I have visited this location many times and although I have always ordered the same thing (Jambalaya) I have a great dining experience each time, as the food is always excellent and the service is terrific. The food items are little more pricey but well worth it. To be honest I was a little bummed that they changed the Mud Pie dessert but not enough to altar my rating as I still get excited every time I visit."}
{"text":"Elephant Bar?  Our 10 year old chose it for her reward dinner. She loved the decor , it was reminiscent of a blend between Rainforest Cafe and Cheesecake Factory. I bet the decor alone made the place expensive to start up, but the only thing that is going to keep it and it's other locations open is the indifference in the palate's of it's dining customers.   It was our first visit, she had been once before and any 10 year old can be enchanted by a huge elephant and a brass giraffe and fans. The menu for most kids is the same everywhere, hot dog, corn dog, mac and cheese, burger, chicken tenders. So why not eat it in a funky enviroment, right?  We ordered the Ahi Tuna Appetizer and three fountain drinks. Fortunately we put that in right away, because the preparing of food here was very slow. The Ahi was actually the best part, I wish there had been more of it. The salad they rested it on however was so-so, something tasted off about it and the strange ginger-like dressing was, well.. strange. We ignored it after a taste.  I ordered Macadamia encrusted fish, my partner a Shrimp special from Chef Reinhold and we let the daughter pick a grown up dinner, half rack of St. Louis ribs. My fish was actually fish sticks and they didn't sub in the sweet potato fries as requested. Since the fish sticks were burnt, I immediately had them returned to the kitchen for a new set. My daughters ribs were quite dry, but she seemed to like them. Not so much the cole slaw or the apples or the fries that came with. It was a good thing she had a late lunch and wasn't very hungry. My partners food was ok, but uninspiring. The bowl of rice and veggies is kind of hard to screw up.  I was given two of their coconut shrimp while I waited for a return entree.  Then the restaurant decided they should give me something to eat while I waited.  They asked if I would accept a house salad and I said, sure, with blue cheese. I received such a watered down version I almost swore it was a poor ranch, but it was something to eat and it helped pass the time.  Everyone had finsihed by the time I got my entree. When the second entree came, some sticks were still darker than I'd like, but it wasn't worth sending it back. The dipping sauces provided for them were disgusting. There was a green pesto like sauce that didn't match fish at all and there was a sweet and tangy sauce overdone with citrus, cloyingly sweet. I ended up using the soy from my partners platter, it was the most palatable. Maybe a tartar or peanut sauce or even a hot sauce would have been better. The coleslaw was mediocre and not worth the calories, the fries ok, but I was dissatisfied.  We also ordered a dessert, daughters choice and she pretty near ate the whole thing herself as dinner was light for all of us.  I almost gave this place three stars, because they took the fish stick disaster off the bill, they tried to make things nice with a salad, the server was doing his best with a kitchen that wasn't making it easy, but the truth is I won't return. My review score should reflect that I don't  think you should visit either, hoping for a better time. I think you'd be sorry about it.  I hope my two star review will help convey the warning that It's just not good enough food and even with the removed entree, no alcohol, we still paid over $50.  There is a lot of selection nearby at this price range, don't get sucked into the decor or unique name. Rename this place \"Elephant Barred.\""}
{"text":"Shout out to Tina even if the food wasn't amazing which it was she made the whole experience so fun and with a huge smile.  I had the Korean chicken street tacos my gf had the cobb salad and we both shared some super yummy parmesean green beans. Really like this place and the outside dining was a great addition."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite restaurant, but no more.  My husband and I went there last night to celebrate my birthday, and it was such a disappointment.  They seem to change their menu a lot, and what we both wanted wasn't on it (or was changed).  I wanted the teriyaki salmon, but could not find it.  I know they have the one with soy sauce, but I never cared for that.  The waiter convinced me that he would have the chef use teriyaki sauce on it, but put a side of the soy sauce because it adds so much.  (??)  Anyway, the salmon (sad looking little thing) came with nothing on the top, and a container of what looked like engine sludge.   I tried a little of it (like putting paste on wallpaper) and then asked for the teriyaki, which he brought and saved me from a clogged engine!  :-)   Rice and veggies were nothing special - dry and too al dente. My husband fared no better with his shrimp scampi.  He said the sauce was awful, and shrimp, well, shrimpy.  He ate very little of it. Oh, and they also messed up the mud pie!  It was very soft ice cream (used to be nice, frozen slice) and just chocolate flavor - I remember it as mocha/coffee, something like that. I do not recommend this restaurant.  I have never posted a restaurant review before, but had such a disappointing experience I just had to do it."}
{"text":"This place is ok, the menu has a good selection of foods and the staff seemed friendly enough.  It was crowded so it took a little while to get our table and our food, however the decor of the place keeps your mind off of the wait time.    The food is average, I cannot say it was horrible, but it was not memorable enough to say that it was fantastic.  There are many other choices of places to eat, however, if I find myself in an area with an Elephant Bar, I know what to expect going in.  I know the staff vary from place to place, I have been here once before and sat in the bar with a friend and I can say the bartendar, a young girl was not the most pleasant.  She was nice and took care of us, but her sense of humor was not a warm and welcoming persoanlity, it is like she was there because it was a job and nothing more.    If you are hungry this is not a bad place and know you will get ok food here, but do not expect a gourmet meal.  Friendly service is a toss up by place and person you deal with I guess, but like I said I would go here again if needed."}
{"text":"Very good food with a different menu from the norm. Interesting bar. Would like to go back for a drink and just hang."}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch today as restaurant week is winding down. Really nice menu for only $ 20.00 per person. And surprisingly the food was very well prepared from our last visit there. A nice surprise. Actually it tasted really darn good. Ciao"}
{"text":"Restaurant including restrooms - clean - check Waitress - friendly and helpful - check Food flavor - incredibly edible - check Price, acceptance of credit cards and ample free parking - check  This place was by far one of the best I've been to and worth the five star rating. We were greeted and quickly seated, our drink selections were assisted by a very friendly waitress names Theresa and our order was taken efficiently with even more suggestions by Theresa. I might also add - Theresa made perfect suggestions.  We had the Parmesan Encrusted Green Bean and Seared Ahi Tuna for starers and followed that with a Chinese Shrimp and Chicken dish that had all the right flavor, a Korean Chicken BBQ Kona, Thai Chicken salad and the surf and turf trio - ALL cooked to order and included some unusual requested alterations.   A special shout out to Theresa who made our night out memorable and treated us like family - good or bad she made the place 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I really have no idea why it has taken me so long to write a review about this dreadful restaurant, but I think I just don't like people to know I bother with chains sometimes!  I have been here so many times, mostly with my Tuesday dinner posse, but a few times with friends and the bf, and gosh...the service here is sooooooooooo bad!  A few general observations: the restaurant does not like to accommodate parties larger than 4....and when you call ahead even, to put 2 tables together takes so long that you get to wait an hour!!! (on a Tuesday no less!)  Happy hour prices @the bar: starts at 9 PM so you can't even order a happy hour drink until that very minute...at least give waters while people wait!  Then the portions on the half off stuff is definitely smaller - but that was never divulged (ordering an entree salad and getting a few shrimp instead of 6-8 is a no-no!!)  Ohhhh the ironic thing is one night I was not feeling well and craved the only thing I ever order there - the macau shrimp and noodle soup and salmon sushi roll combo....and it was actually bad.  I had to hunt down someone for soy sauce.  My bf laughed at me bc the one night I actually craved elephant bar, it was again terrible and he had wanted to go to Cheesecake Factory.  Last night my bf asked, \"Do you want to go to elephant bar?\" and I told him just thinking about eating there made my skin crawl - he laughed and said he was kidding...so we went to PF Chang's (ahhhh I mentioned 2 other chains in this review).  Long story short - don't eat here.  Food is eh (my mom even tried it when she visited me and the French dip is nasty), service is bad, and the hostess doesn't like you."}
{"text":"Came here for late night happy hour which goes from 9pm to closing.  Environment: I sat at the round circle bar. There were a lot of small groups just socializing and have a good casual time. They also had their main restaurant that wasn't too busy.  Service: they only had one waitress and bartender for the bar area at night. Because there were a number of groups, she seemed to be pretty busy and had a hard time catching up with people's needs. Nonetheless, she never forgot anything we ordered which I was impressed by.  Food: the food here is usually pretty delicious. I only had the artichoke dip with the bruschetta and it was very good. The bread was lightly toasty in butter and it came with a creamy dip and side of pico de gallo. I also got the jack sparrow old fashion which was very good and sweet.   Overall, their happy hour deal is amazing. Everything is pretty cheap and everything taste really good. Just expect to wait a bit to get your drinks and food since they are a bit understaffed at night, but as long as you are with friends and are entertained, this is a pretty fun spot to meet up after work."}
{"text":"We had a coupon: 1 app & 2 entrees for $20. Food was mediocre. The portions are large though. The lettuce wraps were the only things that were okay. The service wasn't too bad considering how busy they were. It was worth trying with a coupon, but we wouldn't come back.  Appetizer: WOK-FIRED CHICKEN LETTUCE WRAPS Chopped chicken, water chestnuts, toasted coconut flakes and roasted cashews with fresh Vera Cruz salsa, marinated cucumbers and crispy chilled lettuce leaves. Served with tamarind macadamia nut sauce.  My entree: CITRUS SALAD WITH GRILLED CHICKEN Lemon herb wood-fired chicken breast over a fresh mix of greens with carrots and red cabbage. Tossed with avocado, caramelized walnuts, mandarin oranges, green apples, dried cranberries, gorgonzola cheese crumbles and green onions. Finished with tropical honey citrus dressing."}
{"text":"I have not eaten here recently, but I'd like to throw my two cents in as to why. I used to love the Elephant Bar when I first moved to AZ.  The atmosphere is cool and they had some special lobster sauce. But after my initial two times, the food was terrible. I took my mom, stepdad, and little siblings there... They were not impressed. Then I took my dad and stepmom there... Again, not impressed. Furthermore, I had been raving and even my food was terrible. The fried food was so dark and greasy that even the kids wouldn't eat it. The sauces were different both times. It took forever for the food to come out. Their only saving grace was the coconut shrimp... Which quite honestly, is no better than the frozen costco version so not enough of a save to bring me back... Ever."}
{"text":"Butter cake, butter cake, bake me a cake. Is that the nursery rhyme? Cause the butter cake is awesome! Yum! The food is good as is the service! Nice ambience. Never have anything negative to say about this place! Good for a quick lunch or an informal dinner! Thank goodness we actually have food to complain or give thanks for!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times. Every time the service has been good but very inconsistent. The food is good but with it being a normal chain, there is nothing new or exciting happening on the menu. For the most part, this place is very busy so I would recommend calling ahead. I don't really feel like the prices are on par for the quality."}
{"text":"Normally this place is great but tonight I decided to take my friend to have drinks. We were the only patrons at the bar and we were only able to get one drink while watching both bartenders gossip and check their text messages. It is really sad when bad service kills an otherwise great place. Eat here but don't go near the bar area."}
{"text":"This place has definitely gone downhill since my usual visits years ago. Their menu is constantly changing and it's so big you'll spend at least 10 minutes just looking over what you want. The food is sub-par compared to other places that serve the same type of food. Heck, P.F. Chang's just across the way is much better and you pay only a few dollars more, but the statement is true \"you get what you pay for\" and this location definitely proves that everytime."}
{"text":"Got a gift card so we thought we'd try it again. Service was slow and she was rather grumpy. I had the shrimp pasta with lobster sauce. It was undercooked and did not have a lot of flavor. The shrimp platter we had was boring. I think next year we will regift the gift card."}
{"text":"Meh. Very underwhelming and cold food. Maybe my party and I just ordered the wrong things? Next time maybe I'd try a burger but I won't be rushing back any time soon."}
{"text":"Always consistent great food and great Friendly staff!! Always looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"My husband and usually dine at this location about once a month. We come back because the food is consistently very good and the servers are always attentive and friendly. The only reason I am docking a star is because of the bar. Maybe it's just bad luck, but  each time we have gone, the bar is either out of something or has made the drink from a different recipe. The last time they used a Sprite/ 7up instead of a ginger ale...and another drink had a different whiskey than what we asked for..and the mojito, which is usually very good, tasted like it was seltzer water and not sweet at all. The waitress explained that there were substitutions used and let us change our drinks. I hate to mention it, but ordering the mixed drinks seems to be an issue each time we dine here. We will continue to come here for the food, but I wish they could improve their bar. I think it would also improve their happy hour business if they were known for more than just a glass of wine or sangria."}
{"text":"More 2 1/2 than three. They try hard, they just have a hard time executing. I like the steak and prawns, but half the time it has to go back. This last time it tasted like the Korean BBQ sauce they put on it had burned. Not on the grill, but in the pan they either keep it warm in or when they hear it up for the food.   We also like the crab Louie side salad, the fries green beans and the coconut shrimp.   The salmon is hit and miss as well. Sometimes you get a nice thick filet, other times you get the thin tail end. BTW, I prefer the filet.   The eCookie is great. Most of all, DON'T BE AFRAID TO SEND IT BACK!"}
{"text":"I love a joint with a good happy hour and this place delivers. $3 off ALL apps (including the samplers!) $4 wells, $2 off specially cocktails, $1 off drafts/wine. HH goes from 3-7 and 9-cl. We went with the burger/beer special tonight.  We were beyond satisfied with the HUGE bacon cheese burger with all the fix-ins PLUS a beer and fries for $6.95. Best burger I've had in a looooong time. But if your not in the mood for \"bar food\" they have some great dishes on the regular menu as well. The Jambalaya is so very tasty as is the shrimp soup with salmon. My husbands always gets the ribs. And always eats every last bite. For dessert you MUST try the Mud Pie. It's huge, so definitely share it. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very extensive menu so good place to bring the family.  They specialize in wok style cooking so definitely check out that section of the menu. If you're not in the mood for that they have a large selection of salads (I love the Ahi Tuna Salad) and sandwiches. There is also a Build Your Own Burger (beef patty, chicken breast, gardenburger, salmon/mahi filet) option which is great. The kitchen is equipped with a wood fired grill so burgers/chicken/steaks etc have that great grilled flavor.  There are several specialty cocktails on the menu, like the habenero lime margarita and black cherry mojito...YUM! Staff is friendly and well versed on the menu. Would highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"We started going to the Elephant Bar several years ago.  I was a big fan of their Pacific Cove Crab and Shrimp salad so drug others along.  The salad isn't what it used to be.  They've cut back on the great ingredients and increased the size of the fillers. There was lots more cucumber and limp lettuce and much less other ingredients.  Other items that should have been on the salad were no longer included.  Egg and avocado were missing. I should have sent it back  but instead I won't go back.    Service has also been good .. thus, the 2 stars ... otherwise, it would have rated a 1 star.   I received several emails from Elephant Bar's customers service indicating manager would get back to me.  She also indicated she could tell by the pictures of previous salads I had ordered and sent her that this was definitely different.  She was right as 2 1/2 weeks later he did respond. However, even though she could see the difference, I don't believe he would admit it.  His email indicated that he was sorry I felt that the Louie salad might not be the same.  He was sorry because of how I felt and not necessarily of the changes to the salad.   I wish I could figure out how to post pictures of the salad for comparison here but don't know how to do that."}
{"text":"We had the black cherry mojito, classic mojito, dirty martini, BBQ chicken flatbread, tempura sushi, Korean need tacos, and chocolate indulgence; all were very good! The service was excellent! I was very impressed and will definitely go back again soon."}
{"text":"This review is regarding the owners of the Elephant Bar, CHALAK MITRA GROUP LLC 18900 Dallas Parkway  Suite 125 Dallas, TX 75287  I finally wrote them a letter today after almost a month of my dissatisfied correspondence with their office over a gift card for my father-in-law who lives in Chandler AZ and loves the Elephant Bar.   Dear Sirs,  We have been loyal customers of the Elephant Bar for many years.  As we often do, we purchased a gift card for my father-n-law a few days before Fathers Day knowing that it was possible that he wouldn't receive it on time but we had no idea that it would arrive 15 days (11 working days) after it was ordered. Although this has been resolved and your company has returned the balance to my credit card as well as sent a $25 card to my father-in-law, I believe you should understand the incompetency of your office which required many phone calls and persistent emails on my part.  Here's the timeline: June 14:  received an email confirmation that gift card transaction happened online June 16:  my credit card was billed June 19:  (Fathers Day) I emailed you and requested a tracking #   June 20: reply; \"You ordered the shipment for standard delivery; USPS does not offer a tracking number with this level of service. Thank you-   Client Relations Manager\"  June 23: I emailed the manager and told her that the card had still not arrived.  June 24: she replied;  \"Thank you for notifying me of that. I will send one out from this office. The good news is I have UPS, can send ground and give you a tracking number. I will get it prepared and ready by noon\"  June 28:  I still had no tracking number.  I called. She replied with a tracking number without a \"link\" which is standard practice in all customer services.  June 29:  My father-in-law (blank blank) received the card and it was addressed to (wrong name)...   Sadly, I will never buy another gift card from your company.  This is very disappointing and does not leave a \"good taste in my mouth\" about how you do business."}
{"text":"What a friendly staff!  wonderful ambiance, food is served in a timely manner, and the service is awesome... that credit goes mostly to our favorite server Lucy she's friendly, thorough and attentive. Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"I am 5 starring this based on DRINKS ONLY. I stopped in while waiting for my boyfriend to get off work to grab a martini. It's valentines day and it was super busy but the bartender was quick to take my order and quick to get my drink! I had a raspberry lemon drop martini and it was ama-za-zing! Bartender was super funny too! Good times!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner one time and it was just ok. The decor is upscale casual, but everything was just ok. Service wasn't bad and it wasn't great. I got the burger and fries which were pretty good. This would be a good place for a dates, family dinners, and a drink."}
{"text":"I dine here maybe every three months. The place is lovely. I've never had bad service and my family likes it. I like the large variety, but the food is just not that great. I love the Seared Ahi Tuna Salad, but everything else is just o.k. Probably most important: it's affordable."}
{"text":"My first time dining here was with a large group out on the patio on a Friday evening. The service was great considering there was about 20 of us on separate checks and they had the heaters on and turned down the music for us, very accommodating. My meal was pretty forgettable, it was a steak with some veggies. I would like to come back to try some of the other items on their menu but won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"The food was very good but the service left something to be desired.   For the most part everything tasted good and was well prepared.   My wifes Mongolian beef had some tough peppers but you usually do not eat them anyway.  This is the first restaurant I have ever been to where they bring your salad, after they bring you your  entrée.   Before we finished our meal we were asked if we would like dessert.  This made us feel a bit rushed and like they were in a hurry to get us checked out.  We ordered dessert and our bill was brought to us before our dessert. Maybe we wanted to order more...."}
{"text":"First of all, I should say I go into a restaurant WANTING to love it. It is very hard to make me never want to return- I am a food lover!!  Early 2011. My husband and I received a gift card to this restaurant so we took my sister-in-law out. It ended up being embarrassingly bad, and we felt really bad for taking her here.  Our server was so rude! He was very unprofessional, and acted like he did not want to be there. I wish I could remember his name, but I did not bother to write it down. I recently turned 21, so was excited to try a new drink. I ordered a red apple martini and he brought me a green apple martini.  I do not like to send anything back, so I thought I would give it a try, and I ended up not liking it. I flagged him down and let him know that I had received the wrong drink. He said to me \"are you sure?\" and tried to convince me that I had ordered the green martini. It was very awkward, because I knew (and everyone at my table knew) that I had ordered the red martini. I asked if I could please just get the red one as the green one was not very good. He reluctantly took it away and then returned to our table several minutes later. In a quiet voice he said \"Hey, if my manager asks, tell him you changed your mind, or I will get in trouble\".  Overall, the experience was horrible. There were long gaps in time that our waiter was no where to be seen and at one point we had to get the attention of another waiter for water refills. A customer should never have to ask for a refill after their cup has been empty for 20 minutes. It was very rude. The food was nothing special, did not leave an impression.  We had planned to be there for an hour at the most, but from the moment we walked in to when we left, it was over 2 hours! The length of time of the meal should be dictated by the customer, not by bad service.  We felt very silly for having gone there. Most restaurants strive to give the customer an experience that they will want to return to. This restaurant did not give us that experience at all. Very unfortunate."}
{"text":"I ate at the Elephant Bar last night for the first time in nearly two years.  I have always liked the bar area, and that is where I usually sit.  The beer prices are pretty high ($5.25 for just a pint!), but much of the menu is now reasonably priced.  I noticed the menu is WAY different than it used to be, with a lot of cheaper options.  I got the Garlic Noodles with Sauteed Shrimp, and it wasn't very good.  It was on par with something you'd get at a cheap Chinese restaurant, but more expensive.  My wife enjoyed her salad, and the service was just fine.  It used to be that it was really difficult to find a seat in the bar area on Saturday nights, and you could count on a long wait for a table.  But last night wasn't all that busy, perhaps because the quality of food and service has slipped.  I'm giving it three stars because I used to think that the food here was pretty good, but maybe things have changed."}
{"text":"Introduction: I honestly come here at least once or twice a month at minimum. Not sure why it took me so long to type this review.  Customer Service: 5/5 Everytime we come here, we get this waiter name Joe. Joe is probably the BEST waiter I have ever seen and with a killer crazy memory too. They say elephants have amazing memories.  Hmmmm, maybe that's why he's working at a place call \"Elephant\" Bar! Wink wink!   Joe remembers my order after the 1st time around. Trust me, I am picky. My order is the Cowboy Steak with steam rice, grilled onions on the side lightly cooked, my meat medium well, no blood, diet coke and siracha, soy sauce and Tobasco sauce on the side.  Yes, he remembered all of this on my 2nd time around, holy cow, I barely can keep up with my own order. Anyway, ask for Joe, 10 Stars all the way.  Atmosphere and Cleanliness: 5/5 My opportunity to utilize the word IMMACULATE again. It is spotless and the music sound is perfect, people are nice and the place is super cozy. I can literally take a nap here.  Quality: 5/5 YUMMY for my TUMMY! Always perfectly cooked.  Everything I order is always OUTSTANDING! BEST beer battered onion rings in Town.  All onion rings should be made this way.  Quantity: 5/5 A LOT!!! It's so much, I can barely finish it no matter how hungry I am.  Price: 5/5 You know my rules, if you get perfect service and food right, nothing is overprice. Needless to say, a big piece of Steak with sides included for under $28. HELLO! No brainer, way cheaper than a lot of those fancy Steakhouse restaurants and nearly as good.  Tips:  Many people don't realize there's actually a lot of Asian dishes here. I personally think it's better than Cheesecake Factory, but with a much better environment.  Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"Wow. Circular bar with literally NO TVs visible.  Shame.   Draft beer is only $1 off on happy hour and it's expensive to begin with. Way over-priced. $4.25/for a SMALL pint of domestics. The HH drink menu is strongly weighted to cocktail discounts.  The saving grace is the classic margarita on HH is $3.25.  Happy hour is every day 3-7pm and 9pm to Close, which is nice.  Discounts on food and drinks."}
{"text":"My boyfriend I dined here a few months ago. We'd never been and thought we'd give it a try! The decor was lovely, the staff was very friendly, and the food looked spectacular! Now you'd think my star rating would be better but sadly it isn't. Even though everything looked amazing the food was actually tasteless. We were both surprised that our food tasted so terrible when it looks so amazing. I had ordered a shrimp plate and he ordered a lamb dish. Unfortunately we've never been back and probably wont ever go back."}
{"text":"Mediocre would be the best way to describe this place. Nice on the inside but overpriced food and drinks that you could make better yourself.  I got the chicken sandwich which came with a piece of chicken that tasted like it had been frozen and was about half the size of the bread that it was wedged in between. Spinach dip appetizer was good but small. Not worth the $9 price tag. Wouldn't recommend this place. To many other good restaurants to eat at. Don't waste your money or time."}
{"text":"Absolutely HORRIBLE. If I could I wouldn't even give this place even a star. The worst dinner we ever had, coconut shrimp appetizer was pretty good but our entrees were inedible. My sweet and sour chicken was dry and had more breading than chicken and was burnt. My husbands Mongolian beef was all salt and fat. The manager didn't even recognize it as he asked how he liked his \"cashew chicken\" to which my husband told him it was Mongolian beef. The manager seemed embarrassed that he didn't know his own food. The rice was crispy and hard. When the manager realized we were not pleased with our meal he offered to buy us dessert which we declined since dinner was so bad, we didn't want to take the chance and just wanted to get out. Our waitress, who we saw once to take our order, another time to bring me the wrong drink and the 3rd time to hand us our check (over $60) gave us coupons for our next visit which will never happen. I've never written a review before, good or bad but this was so disgusting I had to share."}
{"text":"This place has such a cool mix of different foods. The happy hour is actually affordable. It's a great place to hang out with friends and great place to bring out of town guests."}
{"text":"We haven't eaten here in awhile. Dinner was great. Lucy was an excellent server. She was very attentive to our party's every need. Glad we chose to dine here."}
{"text":"Visited the Elephant Bar while in Glendale for a work trip.  We enjoyed the dinner! Ordered the potstickers and ahi tuna as apps. Both ok - nothing too special but worked great for our large table of picky eaters.   As an entree I ordered the Kung Pao chicken and shrimp and was very impressed.  Spicy and delicious! Not in the mood for a drink so I can't speak for the bar menu or happy hour but everything else hit the spot and they accommodated a large crowd with no reservations. I would compare this place to a BJ's type chain - which is a compliment!"}
{"text":"We enjoy the food and services. The food was delicious and fresh. We sat outside enjoyed the beautiful weather along with our dinner. It was our first time and we already planning to come back."}
{"text":"I came here for a company function and had some appetizers. The food was above average but the flavors were impressive for the type of restaurant it was. What I find confusing was that the decor and menu didn't match. The menu had Chinese, Thai, and american food but the decor was an African safari theme. What I enjoyed the most were their ribs. For not being a BBQ place their ribs were very good. It had a good amount of smoke, spice, and sweetness. The rest of the food I had was just OK. The service was kinda slow and my waitress did not know what she had on tap. To me, if you're going to assign a person to a party, you better make sure she know's what types of beers you have unless you're a beer garden then it's ok not to remember everything. Also, I noticed that there were Asian cooks so that's a good sign that the Asian food might be good. Overall, I would come back to hang out at the bar and eat the ribs."}
{"text":"It's like Cheesecake Factory on mushrooms.  Why you wonder?  Because the menu is oddly eclectic, yet the decor is strangely safari.  Besides the major misfire in matching theme to decor to menu, the food is great.  They make a killer huge sampler appetizer platter that will feed 4 easily.    Love the burgers.  They will actually cook it to temp med. rare if you ask, which is awesome.  I get the standard cheese, which has some sauce I love, which is probably just mayo and ketchup mixed together, but it works for me.  Tomato basil soup to die for.  Sadly,  my favorite item was just taken off the menu, which was the chicken caprese cutlet.  Why the hell you others didn't order it is beyond me, but thanks for nothing.  I can't carry a whole menu item on my own, ya know.  I've had the chicken marsala with mashed potato and spinach.  The spinach was great, chicken average, and potato smooth.  The salads are huge.  The chopped and crab louis are excellent.  Made to order cobbler for desert  served a la mode and mud pie  (which is mode all on its own - a big, frosty slab of coffee pie with whipped cream and chocolate sauce) are good bets.    The waitstaff is hit or miss.  Most times we've had great service, but it's never personal, meaning, the staff doesn't really chat or form a bond (I like to bond with people bringing me food - it's an Italian thing).  But, the hostess always has your back, and will scream the requisite THANKS FOR COMING, HOPE YOU ENJOYED IT, on your way out."}
{"text":"Disappointing meal at Elephant Bar tonight. Flavorless Macau shrimp & noodle soup and marginal seared ahi tuna salad with wilted or slimy spinach and half of the seared ahi inedible (chewy). Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great place to go if a group can't all decide on what they'd like to eat. I feel there is something for everyone and my 3 year old likes it there too. He gets excited by the animals he sees.  I enjoyed both meals I received there and the service was fast, friendly. The desert I had was just okay. I had a Red Velvet cupcake (maybe I should know better than to get a complicated cake like that at a restuarant) it was very dry and not edible really. I will always go back though because I love the food, the multiple pages of variety and the atmosphere. Lastly, I love the price and find they are very inexpensive for a meal to get you full with leftovers. This is the only location I've visted but would expect that everything would remain unchanged at any location especially since this is a chain."}
{"text":"Same consistant food and service. Getting pricey though. Early dinner as $127 for 4 people. NO DRINKS"}
{"text":"We got here just in time for Monday happy hour. Our table of six ordered two apps each and tons of drinks. Danielle was a great server and kept our drinks full. We didn't wait on a single thing. The green beans were the favorite of our table. Sliders...lettuce wraps...nachos...artichoke dip. It was fabulous!!"}
{"text":"I pretty much come here on my lunch break most days. I love the coconut shrimp skewers. Their HAPPY HOUR is awesome and I enjoy the Lemondrop Raspberry Martini. YUM."}
{"text":"Elephant Bar, in particular this location (I've been to others) was once one of my favorite places to go. I've been a customer since we moved to Phoenix a number of years ago.   Their food has always been \"good\" although never quite, 'great', but that was my expectation. I've taken my friends, family and even coworkers to multiple locations (others are closer to work, for example) and while nobody has ever been blown away, the food has never been a huge issue.   That changed recently. My wife and I visited the Peoria location and I got the rock sugar beef, one of the most expensive items on the menu. I've had this before, numerous times and at two separate locations and I'm well aware of how it should taste when properly made. My wife has also sampled it and knows how it should taste.   So, imagine my amazement when I take a bite on my last visit and it is not only flavorless but somewhat gamey in after taste. I offer my wife a taste, without prompting her as to why, and the first words out of her mouth were, \"That's disgusting!\"  Having confirmed there was a problem and it wasn't just me, I sent the dish back and told them why. I informed the server that I'd had this dish numerous times before and so had my wife and we both told her it tasted like \"bad/old meat\" and was not right. She relayed this message to the kitchen manager, \"Bryan\" and he sent her back to tell us that not only had he tasted it, but he found nothing wrong with it. Further, they are cooked in batch and if I don't like it, the next one will probably turn out the same so it's best that I order something else rather than have them cook a new one.   Yes, that's right, Bryan was such a tough guy that he sent a woman in his place to call my wife and I liars with no pallet and to order something else if I don't like it, because it's clearly not his fault or his kitchen producing bad food. I opted to save room for dessert and that was the last we heard from management.   Incensed, I spoke with two other managers by phone (never did get to speak with Bryan, still hiding in the kitchen I guess) and eventually talked with corporate. They put me in touch with the general manager, Richard, and we had an email exchange where I gave a detailed account of the situation.   Mind you, I stated to all three managers in person and to corporate on the phone that I did not want a gift card out of this, I wanted someone to fix the problem. Richard, naturally, offers me a gift card. I turned it down and reminded him that wasn't my goal and I wanted an explanation for why the food was bad and why we were treated like liars or bad customers and didn't even get a table-side apology from a manager when we sent the food back, only an insult from a manager hiding in the kitchen who wouldn't talk to us face-to-face.   Richard never answered me. My last email to him I said I would gladly return to this restaurant if he could explain to my why I should expect the experience to be different the next time. I told him, bluntly, to give me a reason other than the gift card and I would gladly return to the restaurant. Richard never responded.  No response from management means no more business from me, my family or my colleagues. These people should be ashamed of themselves."}
{"text":"In what should probably have come as no surprise, but somehow still managed to astonish me, this location suffers from some of the same management drawbacks as the other Elephant Bar location in Peoria. Somewhat ironically, it also suffers from the inability to properly prepare the same dish on a consistent basis.   Allow me to elaborate with an example from my most recent visit. My wife and I dined here for lunch as we work nearby and had been several times before. As per usual, service was simply so-so. A common theme between this restaurant and their Peoria location is slow drink service, and I cannot understand how that can be when the place is 70% empty at the start of lunch service (11am).   I ordered my standby, go-to dish which is the rock sugar beef. When cooked properly, it is one of my all-time favorites and, for the last year or so, the only thing I will order at this place because I can't bring myself to pass on it for something else. After what seemed like a bit too long of a wait, the food finally came out and, much to my disappointment, the rock sugar beef was once more prepared incorrectly by incompetent and lazy kitchen staff.   So what was it this time, at this location? For starters, the wrong kind of mushrooms were used, and mixed in with the standard fair. I'm all for variety, but I prefer the mushrooms they're -supposed- to cook it with per the menu, not whatever other types they have kicking about in the kitchen. That's beside the main issue, however, which was the quality of the meat. Out of the maybe 7 hunks of beef that I have, at least half of them were overly fatty and/or contained gross sections of grizzle. And it wasn't the kind you could cut off, it was all through and horribly marbled into the meat, so there was no way to salvage the pieces. The kicker, however, was that the largest piece on the plate, by about three times the size of the nearest competitor, was almost 90% fat chunk. There was almost no usable meat on it, it was literally a pile of fat and sinew that someone should have thrown away from the get-go, but instead decide to cook up and serve to me, as if I was a dog that would eat this kind of utter crap.  I told the server, who seemed to have no empathy whatsoever, that this was not what I expect from one of the more expensive items on the menu and a signature dish. He offered to get the manager and send him over, and sure enough the guy showed up in short order. This is where the story takes an even worse turn.   From the start, this guy was a completely dismissive jerk. I told him I'd been eating this dish many times at both locations, probably fifty times in total, and never had it this nasty before. I knew what it was supposed to be and this was absolutely not it. His response? Basically a superficial, insincere and backhanded apology, stating that, \"Well, you've had it 50 times without a problem and things happen.\"   Excuse me? You're basically telling a customer who just told you he's been in your restaurants that many times that, \"Oh well, it happens. Sorry you expect perfection, that's not gonna happen.\" He also went on a tirade about how he serves hundreds of these a day without a problem so clearly this is just an anomaly and nothing to worry about. Great customer service, tell me I'm making a mountain out of a mole hill, I really want to hear that after you served me dog food.    To put it mildly, I was shocked by his attitude and body language. He offered to have another batch cooked up, but I declined (who would want the same idiot to cook them more dog food?). He made no mention of going back to the kitchen staff to ask what brain donor decided to put a 1lb lump of fat on my plate and call it beef. He didn't take the offending, dog-food looking pile (I lumped all the inedible pieces together to show him how much it was) back to the kitchen staff either. He just walked off in a huff, pissed that I was unwilling to accept garbage after 50 visits. I guess his expectation is that I should allow for complete crap food every now and then, otherwise I'm some kind of effete snob.   And yes, he comped it off the bill, but I'd have preferred if he had gone back and gotten an explanation for why I was served utter dog food, how it made it out of the kitchen to begin with, and come back to tell me why it wasn't going to happen again and why I should continue visiting so frequently. Instead, I just get it coldly comped off the bill (he didn't even say he would do this) and then no drink refills for the remainder of our time in the restaurant. I guess that was my punishment for complaining about being served something unfit for animals, much less human consumption.   I will never return to this location until I receive an apology from someone in upper management. I cannot believe that I have to go through this sort of disappointment again after the experience at the Peoria location, but apparently this is some kind of endemic problem to this chain."}
{"text":"Nice place love the decor, here with a large party all whom enjoyed their meals. I ordered chicken fingers and a side salad. Chicken fingers were not buffalo when they came out. Had to ask for my side salad way after everyone else's meals came out.  Plus sides were the yelp check in for the free desert and download the app for a free appetizer."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Sat at the bar for 10 min!!!! Didn't get a menu or anything!!  There are so many options avoid this dump!  Bartenders too busy talking to each other to take an order."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good and atmosphere was nice. We were greeted upon arriving and chose to sit in the bar area. Luckily we caught the tail end of happy hour which was nice. Our bartender was a riot. It's been a long time since I've had a server that is so straightforward and friendly (with dry humor). There was another couple next to us that were some of her regulars that spoke very highly of the service as well. Made our date night a humorous one. I think her name was Angie or Angela. Definable ask for her section. We will return."}
{"text":"Hostess - poor Server - poor Food - just okay Ambiance - weird Price - too much  Will not eat here again."}
{"text":"Drinks here are like no other , the service was top notch. We sat out side and it was great. We had some apps and the spicy edeme was super good wish it was a little more spicy but I understand.   I will be back to try the dip again because I could just eat that and be good for awhile"}
{"text":"Consistently good food and service. They also put coupons in the news paper from time to time. My favorites here are the thai hi chicken salad, orange shrimp, and creme brulee. My husband loves the jambalaya and burgers.  Tim is a fantastic server and I always ask for his section when he is working. He works very hard and provides excellent service. The managers always come around and ask if everything is ok. I also love the atmosphere here!"}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted a couple of drinks and Cheesecake Factory was packed so we decided to come to elephant bar since it was right next door. There was no wait and the bar was empty (not a good sign). We ordered our drinks; I got the jungle colada and she got the Mai tai. They were both ok. Nothin special.   I decided I was a little hungry but not enough for a whole entree. I'm a sucker for a good Mac and cheese so I got a side of Mac and cheese hoping it would be amazing. And my friend got the Thai high salad. When our food came out, my Mac and cheese looked good but her salad was a bagged salad wth fancy wok'd chicken nuggets in it. What kind of \"trendy\" restaurant serves bagged salad? Or chicken nuggets instead of nicely sliced chicken? Then I take a bite of my Mac and cheese and it was most definitely boxed Mac and cheese. I tried to eat a few bites but I just couldn't. It was horrible.   My friend and I were extremely unsatisfied with everything. We left disappointed. Next time we would rather just wait an hour for the cheesecake factory bar."}
{"text":"Typical chain restaurant. The food is ok. They had a happy hour while we were there for some drinks and appetizers but wasn't very impressed by the deal. The only beers included were coors and bud I think (they have other beers available but they were not included with the happy hour deal). The vibe is comfortable but I'd rather spend the money somewhere else with less of a chain feel and a little higher quality food."}
{"text":"Now, I can put away food and I love serve but... when is enough? No line to wait (a plus), happy hour ( a plus) cold food lets talk. Bit into my Orange chicken and it was ice cold. My broccoli was also cold. So I ask for another. Guess what they went back and microwaved it up. Are you kiddin me. Please remake my meal. I'm not trying be difficult but if I pay for something I want it the right way? After a little talk with the manager then it was better. Damage was done. I give it two stars."}
{"text":"You could describe the Elephant Bar chain of restaurants as comfort food with an Asian accent.  The menu is fairly large, and contains Chinese style wok-fired items, sandwiches, ribs, fish and chips, etc.  You get the idea.  Some of the food is better than what you would expect in a chain -- the barbequed ribs and crispy salmon tempura, for example, but much of it is average or even subpar (like the patty melt -- dry and tasteless).  I would only grant Elephant Bar two stars, but the prices make it clear that they are not trying to do much more than they accomplish.  It is honestly mediocre.  That's something.  I guess.  Go here for a quick average meal after the movies, if you go at all.  Note:  Seniors, over 60, get 20% off with a \"Safari card\", and there are often coupons and discounts available."}
{"text":"I am not entirely sure how to describe The Elephant Bar, other than to say it is akin to walking into Razmataz without much furniture?  There is just a lot of... Africa... in there.  It is exactly what you would expect - hence the three stars.  I love their pineapple, pink swirly drink with rum in it.  I have no idea what it is called, but it is the only reason I hit up this place.  Their food is pretty average, prices above average, and my \"chicken tender\" snob sister said that she didn't care for hers, which makes this place difficult for a picky eater.  If you come out of the mall and want a sit-down dinner, this place is by far better than the other options.  Check it out - maybe you will find a new love!"}
{"text":"Amazing Food, Great Atmosphere, Music, Sports Bar all wrapped into one. Their food is on the high end, but aye what would you expect with fine dinning!?!  Everything on the menu is a must try, great place to take a date if you want to add a little bit of sophistication without going overboard."}
{"text":"I stopped in today at lunch with my boss. It was 11:30 and we were seated right away. It was not crowded at all. I have to say off the bat that the waiter that we had was exceptional. He was very attentive, anticipated our needs (like more sugar packets, refills, extra napkins), and was friendly.  We both started out with soup. Leighton had the cream of asparagus and I had the french onion soup. I had a taste of the cream of asparagus soup which was delicious. I'm usually creeped out by cream of anything soup but, like I said, it was pretty good. It reminded me of a broccoli cheese soup I had once - same kind of tang - but with asparagus. The french onion soup was excellent. I definitely recommend it. I used to stop in Mimi's cafe for their french onion soup but think this has just made my list as far as the best in town.   For our meals we both did the \"meal\" salads. Leighton had the Thai - high chicken salad. Of course I had to try some of that too. The chicken was a bit over cooked for my taste. Whatever it was cooked with was burnt and had a rubbery texture to it. I'm not a fan.   I got the seared ahi salad. As you can tell from my reviews, I'm a raw sushi kind of guy. With that said, I could have dealt with having it a little less cooked, however, it was great. It had green sesame seeds on it...I asked what that was about to see if he could tell me what it was sauteed with. He mentioned that they are seasoned and sauteed but he didn't know what with. If it was some type of wasabi, it was not strong. There wasn't anything \"spicy\" hot about the salad. It had a very light dressing on the greens which also had sun dried tomatoes and edemame.   All in all, it was a great lunch and I would go back again. It was a bit pricey for what it was, but we had a coupon for buy one entree get one free which made it worth while. I wish I had room to try the creme brule. It looked great. Maybe I'll stop in some evening after work for a dessert fix ;-)"}
{"text":"Always good service here. Sat at the bar for the Happy Hour special. To drink, I had the Skinny Girl Cucumber Cocktail. It was sweet & refreshing (plus low calorie). For food, I had the Misoyaki Salmon with brown rice & veggies. I give it a 2 out of 5 unfortunately. The salmon was cooked inconsistently & brown rice was a bit dry. My bf had the same thing & he said his was like that too. For $16.50 for the plate, we won't order it again. Although I've had their aps before and they were always excellent & fresh.   The bartenders are always GREAT. The guy at the bar, he was attentive to us & also funny. Will definitely return again."}
{"text":"Service was great and food was delicious!  Thanks to Jamie for making our big party happy!!!!"}
{"text":"Im not gonna lie here, The Elephant Bar by my house (Torrance, Ca) is terrible. So I was reluctant to eat here. But since it was in Arizona, I figured I'd give it a whirl.   The African jungle theme is really cool at this place. The upholstery has zebra skin, elephants, and jungle; pretty cool. The service was pretty quick,me specially since we had 23 persons in our group. The drinks were flowing and the food only took about 30 minutes to come out.   I had Angel hair pasta with shrimp in lobster sauce. Overall, it was pretty good! Lots of flavor and plenty of shrimp!  I made a point to try other dishes on the table to provide the best review possible. I tried the shrimp plate, Mongolian Beef, appetizer sampler, and Breaded chicken. The food was pretty damn good. All pastas and meats were cooked just right with nice presentation.   I enjoyed my time here. The staff was nice, food was tasty, and drinks were flowing. All pointing to good times!"}
{"text":"Everything here was underwhelming. The menu is huge and, just like you would imagine after watching a few episodes of Kitchen Nightmares, you know this isn't going to end well.   Both meals were just not good - not terrible \"I'm worried about food poisoning bad\" - but definitely not good. The waitress took our drink orders immediately upon sitting and still we didn't get our drinks until halfway through our main course. A second drink was never brought and we decided better to pay and leave than press the issue.   Takeaway: Not worth it under any circumstances. The decor is cheesy, staff is underwhelming and the food disappoints. Turns out you can't have 1000 things on your menu and pull it off."}
{"text":"You know I see some really prissy and picky people trying to review this place.  I've come on two separate occasions and I enjoyed it. The restaurant is low lit and has a great smell. Each time they gave me a table near the kitchen and had the chef give us a complimentary dessert . Now of course there is going to be a bit of a wait when they are busy, so try not to give them so much hassle. I order the Jambalaya, so I was full aware I would be waiting awhile but for me once I got the food, it was worth my wait.  Try the Strawberry shortcake if you get the chance, just great."}
{"text":"Elephant Bar is nothing to write home about. I had lunch there with some coworkers. The soup and sandwich I had was decent but nothing I couldn't have eaten at the local Panera. The one saving grace of this lunch was the crispy green bean appetizer, which was actually quite delicious. Otherwise, don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Elephant Bar for several years, and was concerned maybe with the economy they went under, but I found the contrary!  Met a business colleague for lunch and was quite pleased with our server. She was attentive and polite and didn't check up on us too much.  I had the Kona Cooler, which had Red Bull in it, so I was set for the rest of the day..haha.  Entree was jambalaya - scrumptious. A very well made dish with the perfect assortment of rice, meat, and seasonings.  Will have to bring my wife and family back sometime. Thanks guys"}
{"text":"I am looking forward to spending more time at the GVR District and it was great to find out that the Elephant Bar started a rewards card. When I registered on the app, my family was able to order the thai-chili edamame appetizer on the house. The  customer service was on-point, the server was polite and patient. We felt like we could time our time and enjoy the experience without feeling rushed eventhough it was a busy night. My wife and I ordered the same thing thesirloin topped with a flavorful steak butter also served with ratatouille vegetables and brown rice (from the lighter side). The sirloin was cooked perfectly...it is difficult to get a perfect medium-rare steak these days. We will be back to earn more rewards!!"}
{"text":"I ate dinner there Valentine's night with my dad & stepmom. I ordered crispy chicken teriyaki and it was perfect as always! Both my dad & stepmom ordered some spicy jambalaya dish with spicy rice. They said that's what they always order. The rice ended up being too spicy so the waiter brought plain white rice.  My dad wanted garlic bread & assumed it came with his dinner but it didn't so our waiter never missing a beat brought him some. They pretty much ran the waiter for the entire meal. It was very busy that night being Valentine's Day and our waiter Jordan did an outstanding job. Unfortunately my dad is very cheap & nitpicky so after dinner was over & we said our goodbyes, I hid around the corner until they were gone & went back into the restaurant to give Jordan a bigger tip. He really deserved it."}
{"text":"This is a nice restaurant for big groups to go to for lunch/dinner. I have eaten here countless times over the years and it has always been decent. The menu has a variety of items so people with different tastes should be able to choose what they'd prefer to eat easily. I've enjoyed the iceberg wedge salad, the ultimate bacon cheeseburger, and especially the seared ahi Tuna dish. I've also tried their teriyaki bowls, calamari, ceasar salad, and have had a Mai tai and a couple other cocktails here before. Price-wise it's okay, not stellar. My biggest complaint one day was when I came to watch some Sunday Football in the bar and was told they did not have the Sunday ticket which is a shame. I had to quickly eat my lunch so I could leave and go to Green Valley Ranch to watch the game I wanted to see."}
{"text":"Since joining the HR family at my job, they thought it fitting to have a welcome lunch.  We decided on Elephant Bar.    The place is full of dramatic statues of African animals: giraffes and of course, elephants.  It's covered with trees and makes you feel like you're in a small safari.  After a few minutes of waiting, we were sat by the kitchen.  Above our table, the air condition ducts were dripping of condensation.  Too bad it was right above where I was seated, so my entire place on the table was dripping wet.    First thought about their menu: a lot going on, kinda like Cheesecake Factory.  On this day, I got the Santa Barbara burger.  They cooked it medium for me and was seasoned great!  The avocado was what sealed the deal for this burger.  SOOOO good and juicy!  I also loved the zebra print wrapper the burger came in.  With the burger, there was side choices you could choose from.  I chose the caesar salad.  One piece of advice: Don't get crazy with the cheese!  I love cheese, but the parmasean cheese on this salad was just too much!  Out of the 5 years I've been in Vegas, I've only been to Elephant Bar 3 times.  This was my first time dining here.  It was an ok experience, however, I'm curious to try the Macadamia crusted fish and chips, so you best believe I will be back!"}
{"text":"We visited on a slow Sunday so seating was immediate and the place was relatively quiet. My wife had a top sirloin steak and I had the jambalaya. The steak was prepared perfectly and was very tender and tasty. The jambalaya was fantastic. We would definitely recommend this restraint to anyone"}
{"text":"After a morning of shopping in busy Scottsdale we decided to stop at Elephant Bar on Mayo to get out of the craziness that can be Scottsdale Road area.  We had been to this location before and remember it as being ok for drinks and appetizers so off we went.  We were greeted immediately by a friendly fellow and shown to a table in the bar. When I asked why we couldn't sit in the restaurant the waiter said we could and no problem.  Maybe we look like big drinkers and he thought we'd want to be seated close to the liquor.  LOL.  My husband ordered a Ahi Tuna Salad and said the tuna was really fishy but the greens were fine.  Instead of a regular entrée I opted to order off the appetizer menu and got the chicken lettuce wraps.  PF Chang's has nothing to worry about.  Theirs are far superior to the ones I just had at EB.  Very boring.  We shared another appetizer, the crispy green beans. I don't think they got their grease hot enough because these were incredibly greasy and smelled of old grease.  The chipotle sauce served with them was ok and the only thing that made the greasy green beans even a little bit edible.    If I would have noticed how horribly stained the booth was that they seated us in I probably would have insisted on leaving.  Unfortunately I did not see how dirty it was until my husband stood up to go to the restroom.  I will pass on Elephant Bar the next time I am in the mood for Ahi Tuna, Chicken Lettuce Wraps, crispy green beans or a clean booth to sit in!"}
{"text":"Dawn was great at the bar. I highly recommend her for service. I would come back because of her alone but the food was really great too. Come check thing place out! My wife recommends the jungle colada. I had the hop shock"}
{"text":"We're here at happy hour waiting. One of the waitresses was sitting with another employee. I didn't know she worked here until she told the other person, \"let me drop this wine off \", a glass that had been sitting at the bar for 15 minutes. The service at the bar was even worse. How unfortunate because this is one of my go to places in California (Torrance location ROCKS). It's too bad the service here isn't even close to what I've experienced at other locations."}
{"text":"I probably would not have come here however my daughter's school had a fundraiser here and I like to go and support the school. The jungle themed decor seemed to be very appealing to all the kids.  It was not your run of the mill night in the restaurant.  I will say that our server was very pleasant and helpful.  I asked what she reccomended and she gave me a few suggestions.  I opted for the macadmia crusted mahi mahi.  My daughter had a rice bowl.  Everything came out quickly and piping hot.  I must say my fish was delicious.  And the portion was quite generous.  My daughter loved her rice bowl.  She got ice cream with her meal also.  Overall they appeard to be doing a great job with the amount of people that were there.  I saw food come out pretty quickly and everyone seemed to be having a good time.  Would I came back?  They offer a $5 off coupon if you sign up for their e-club.  My daughter loved the decor and she asked if we could go back sometime so ya, we probably will."}
{"text":"Came to the elephant bar for an early dinner had some really awesome service. If you stop by the chandler location ask for Jeff!!"}
{"text":"Ok, I have not been here for almost 7 years when it first opened up because I thought it a little pricey for what you get, and being a family man, NO KIDS MENU. Well, I guess with recession they have smartened up. My wife and daughter and I went in on a coupon special that was a pretty good value. Thought we would check it out again. Right off the bat, I asked if they had a kids menu,and they do, a really decent one too. My daughter loved the monkey mask, and she has food allergies - the menu was GREAT FOR HER. In fact, meeting her needs was the best thing they did that day. They even accomodated a dessert for her - banannas instead of ice cream with strawberry sauce.  MY FOOD - first of all, my wife and I are big water drinkers, issues with sugar, fake sweeteners and caffeine. Believe it or not, we still tip well contrary to the rule of thumb about water drinkers. Our waiter was jerk from the start. Not accomodating, unwilling to give the dressing choices for the salads - he said - \"the usuals\", but the worst was the water. For a yuppie restaurant, the water was not filtered and tasted like a bandaid - I think they were dropping in sanitizer tabs to get people to up the bills. We did not want to order pelligrinos that day and we were really thirsty. He said it always tasted like that, if we didn't want to deal with the taste to get a drink. My question is, if it is the local water, the sodas and teas would also carry some bad flavor.  We have eaten at every restaurant surrounding that, and did not have that problem. I ordered an iced tea, and my wife got a seltzer water, which they charge for. She was only trying to avoid the taste of the tap. The food was plentiful, but kind of bland - we ordered the chicken piccata caprese. Then the dessert came out, and my brownie was a  pile of crumbles with whipped cream on top. WOW! Not bad taste, but made you wonder. The manager was never notified, although they got a new dessert and I was afraid it was going to be spit in because the waiter was kind of jerky. After I talked to the manager who was an even bigger idiot, and made me want to never return. I actually said something because my daughter liked it, and I wanted to try it again - but now I am unsure about it. Maybe, but 3 strikes and they will be OUT!"}
{"text":"Ok wow! didn't realize how terrible the reviews were for this place. Ive eaten here twice once was 7 years ago and my second time I had a gift certificate so I decided to give this place another try. I must admit this place has improved alot compared to before.. I was impressed how the menu had so many ethnic foods and so many options to choose from. The service was great, our waitress kept checking in on us and made sure everything was perfect. The food was mediocre but i still enjoyed it. I had the misoyaki salmon and my friend had the jambalaya. The salmon was delicious, but then again i love salmon and love it in any way it was prepared. As for the jambalaya it was not too impressive it was just ok. We also had a spinach and artichoke dip for appetizers and that too was just ok. Over all i just give an A-OK, the service was great and the food was just A-OK, The onyl way i would go back is if someone really wanted to eat here. Maybe next time i will try the bar area and try their bar foods.."}
{"text":"I'll give my experience here a D+   Upon arrival Floors and table were dirty. Bathroom had graffiti on the walls. My biggest beef (pun intended) was my steak. I ordered the top sirloin and it was smothered in butter and over cooked. I ordered it medium well and it was closer to well then medium. I guess that's what you get for $16. The Veggies looked soggy (didn't even try). The only appealing looking food was the mashed potatoes, until I tried them. You have to try hard to mess up mash potatoes. The only thing I liked out of the meal was the lagunitas ipa, even though I ordered a rebel ipa. You cant fool an Irish when it comes to beer. When I asked the waiter he said \"oh yeah, we're tapped out of rebel\", then walked away. It would have been nice to maybe offer the second beer at a discount because he didn't give me what I ordered, but whatever. Standards must be pretty low if you find this \"Asian restaurant streak house bar\", or whatever it is, appealing. Since we're in Vegas I'll place a wager that this place will be out of business when the BWW opens."}
{"text":"What do you call an elephant with glass slippers?  Cinderelephant.  This elephant walks into a bar...  Had enough?  Me to.  I probably won't be back to Elephant Bar.  My food wasn't bad.  It was just mediocre and overcooked.  For the money I could go so many other places.  The atmosphere tries to be interesting and jungley-wungley with animal patterns all over the place.  It struck me as a buffet in Vegas.  I'm not quite sure why but that was the overall impression and it hit me quick.  Not one of the good buffets either.  A buffet overcrowed with blue hairs and sweaty tourists, a loud and bustling buffet with high prices and mediocre food.  To their credit (I think) the desserts we split were huge.  I would call them family style.  1 dessert could easily have served 4 people."}
{"text":"great place to just relax and have great food---we loved our waitress and the mgs. were always so nice to us too in this place---its accross from the hotel and most of the people would rather go to visit this restaurant too--"}
{"text":"Very busy tonight so we sat  in the bar area. We had margaritas during happy hour and were able to order from the  full menu. I had orange chicken and my husband had the teriyaki chicken. All was very good. We used a coupon for one appetizer or dessert and two entrees. The only dessert available for the coupon had walnuts  in it and my husband is allergic to them so they let us substitute. Our server was fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Really hit or miss.  We got a gift card for Elephant Bar some time ago, so we have been there twice to use it up.  The first time, we ordered the chicken marsala and cream of asparagus soup.  FABULOUS.  Also, Elephant Bar has extraordinary iced tea.  The second time, my fiancé duplicated his original order and I got a weeeeeeeeird salad with basil leaves in it.  His order, which was so great the time before, was super bland and the sauce was really lumpy.  My salad was utterly disgusting.  More than half the salad was basil leaves rather than lettuce.  Sure, I expected the basil, but as a complement to the salad itself... not that the basil itself was the salad!  The people who gave us the gift card have some notion that Elephant Bar is our favorite restaurant (not sure why), so I bet we'll be getting another gift card for the next major occasion.  It's a very Seinfeld-ish of situation.  That's the only reason I would likely return.  I really value consistency when I dine out... it's a major bummer when you come back for something (like my fiancé's chicken marsala), only to feel like you're eating a completely different dish."}
{"text":"Most amazing time.  Bar was fun and the happy hour prices were amazing.  Love the decor and the employees all seemed to be having a great time.  I even saw the a couple of employees joking and having fun with a darker skinned manager.  It was a pleasure to see people enjoying their jobs."}
{"text":"This is great. Angela is a terrific bartender. Good drinks, excellent service, personable, and makes our business meetings go smoothly. Stop by, ask for Angela and Enjoy the best experience ever. (Food is great too) - don't miss this chance to relax and enjoy. Yum  ***********************************************************************  I hate seeing good places get in trouble but....alas EB has closed. It seems they are closing many locations which is a shame as they've been a standard for decades. Good luck everyone in the reaming locations."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Wednesday they weren't very busy.  Took long time to get drinks.  Then when food came it was cold ordered a second drink came when we ready to leave. Food was good better if hot. No excuses service sucks."}
{"text":"Once our meal was delivered we didn't see our server anymore, she did not come back to see if we needed anything or if we needed drink refills.  Once that she finally came to our table it was to bring us our bill.  She had a do not care attitude, she costed herself a very generous tip. As we were leaving we ask the hostess to please get the manager so we could make him aware of the poor service we received. The food was good but not good enough to go back to get the poor service."}
{"text":"Went for lunch yesterday, I had the chicken tortilla soup/ Caesar salad combo... The soup was very hot which is always a bonus, the salad on the other hand had a very peculiar taste.. And it was soggy, The soup was too thick for my taste. The only thing that saved me from not returning was the service! We were never rushed and the conversation flowed."}
{"text":"Have been here before in California didn't know we had one in Vegas. We went here after leaving P.F. Chang's. Our server Jamie was amazing!!!  The food was absolutely delicious!!  Highly recommend!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I come with my coworker every other week as we are creatures of habit. Unfortunately our last experience didn't start off so great as we found ourself arriving before the lunch crowd, but one of the last ones to get served. The good thing is the manager recognized the situation before we escalated in frustration and explained what happen regarding the delay (new cooks). They valued us and that was important... Along with a gift card to return... Been back twice since and still plan to return."}
{"text":"This place was pretty cool, the decorations on the inside were very need. Very african vibe to it. I got the beef sliders and those were very tasty, the au jus wasnt amazing but it was a fun place. The coconut shrimp were not very good, they were on a stick and looked like corn dogs. The dipping sauce also was not the best. Drink prices were good during happy hour. The atmosphere was fun because the waitresses were nice and it was busy in there. Overall the food was ok but the place was nice."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and decor, lots of choices, good food.   AMBIANCE You kind of feel like you are going on safari when you walk in here. There are tiger and zebra stripes everywhere. There is a Vegas feel to the place because of the zany motif.  FOOD There is a random array of choices for your dining pleasure. Food quality overall is above average. Everything is made fresh onsite so they have that going for them. The menu is made up of lots of items that you can find elsewhere at specialty restaurants (seafood, thai, etc)  SERVICE:  Overall our service here has been touch and go. Sometimes good, sometimes just so-so. Service has been pretty inconsistent.  Other: Our first time there, the manager came over and gave us a $10 gift card and told us to visit again. Thats was pretty awesome for our first visit but it has kind of gone downhill from there."}
{"text":"Summer is hot, hot, hot and so is the Elephant Bar when their a/c isn't working. Decent food and a good server but disappointed beyond belief that they didn't tell us their a/c was not working on an evening when the 8 pm temperature was still 101!  Honestly, I don't remember the food that much. I do remember perspiring through the meal. The red wine should have helped but it too was warm.   I'd heard good things about this place and it was close to where we were staying. We won't be back during our week-long stay."}
{"text":"The food was great the service was average. I ordered an appetizer a big salad and a meal all top notch. Everything was cooked properly and delicious I can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"This place has good happy hour specials we went here for a couple drinks before we went to a movie over at green valley they have pretty good happy hour snacks as well def try this place.."}
{"text":"Elephant Bar Restaurant is also located near the Chandler Mall.  This place always seems to be busy and I don't know why.  Mixed reviews, that's all I say.  My dinner was okay, but not memorable.  The best thing was the ice cream sandwich for dessert - this was absolutely heavenly and I'd go there and just have that.  I went back a second time with a friend around Christmas time.  We had to sit at the bar and it was just gross.  The bar smelled like a brewery and everything was sticky.  I mean, I've been in bars that don't stink like a frat room basement.  My lunch was totally unmemorable again.    There are better places to go."}
{"text":"My experience with Elephant Bar has only been through takeout, but my Postmates driver made special note to how nice the place is and that he was going to go there himself.   The food so far has been outstanding. To date we've had the Beer Battered Onion Rings, which were way over salty, but other than that decent. The Tempura Salmon Rolls, which were terrific, and a nice treat to have as an appetizer without just going to a Sushi place. The Garlic Chick Alfredo was a big hit. The Pub Burgers are really great. And my personal favorite, the Caramelized Pear and Blue Cheese Burger, which is fantastic.   And the prices are really good. I'll likely stop by the restaurant sometime myself, as it looks pretty cool in the pictures."}
{"text":"We went during happy hour (3-6pm) and got wonderful deals on drinks, appetizers, and shared plates. Their sautéed vegetables and Ahi tuna are amazing, as well as the mango and baby kale salad. Service was excellent and the bar area was designed very well."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite with Cesar Q.  and some work peeps.  The ambiance at this restaurant/bar is great!  Love the safari theme.  The staff wears pretty cool safari type shirts with denim bottoms.  We were greeted at the door and promptly seated in the back just off the kitchen.  There were 5 of us and apparently this was the only place for us!?  Whatever our food got to us quicker I suppose.  We were lucky that there was someone in training so we had 2 servers.  We were asked what we wanted to drink and quite quickly we got our beverages.  Placed our order with ease.  The servers did a good job.  I ordered a dinner salad and baked potato as my entree.  The salad was fine, nothing special.  My stuffed baked potato was good but the outside had been burnt with crispy black spots on it.  Such a let down.  We spilt one tortilla soup and I can say it was really quite good.    I'm not overly impressed by this place.  It's pretty ordinary something like an Applebee's type place.  Everything appeared to be pre measured.  Would only come back if I have to because of work or drinks."}
{"text":"The service is nice. The manager is nice. The waitresses are patient.   The food is not surprising good but worth the money. We used the 20 dollars coupon, great price. they have Asian food too.  One of the dish has a cute name: pacific rim chicken. Sounds like a movie.   I like their drinks. House made, tasty."}
{"text":"Love the food here.  Lately it has been the Cobb salad for me as I am trying to eat healthier but it is hard to resist the deserts. Everything on the menu is delicious and the prices are right. They have an open kitchen so you can see the chefs. If you like it a bit quieter you should not sit near the kitchen. The outside area and booths are nice."}
{"text":"Only been once for happy hour and sat at the bar but the experience was great and we will definitely be back. Bartenders were very nice and attentive happy hour deals on food and drinks are great and they have a lot of options prime rib sliders are amazing only thing that could use some work is their draft beer selection I feel like it was lacking in variety overall very good I can't say anything about the dinner menu though"}
{"text":"Happy hour from 3 to 6pm then 9pm to close.  Great happy hour deals. The food is good the drinks are okay. Nothing special.  The food took a little bit long to come out but we were not in a rush out anything.  The service from our waitress was atentative and prompt. The lettuce wraps are great."}
{"text":"First time in an EB for me and I mostly enjoyed my lunch - the shrimp variety platter (or whatever it was called) was substantial and a decent value. The decor here is like an adult version of a rainforest cafe and the menu is far too large and random ala cheesecake factory but with a lower quality product. I have heard through the grapevine that happy hour here is worthwhile."}
{"text":"Coupons! Yes, there I said it. Coupons. Every couple weeks there are 2 for $20 coupons in the newspaper (that thing made out of paper that someone throws on your driveway in the wee hours of the morning) For $20 bucks you get your choice of three appetizers or a dessert and two entrees (choose from six select items). Plenty of food for two! It's a great deal if you like the entree choices.  This week they changed it up a bit and now it's 2 for $25 and includes 2 salads, 2 entrees and a dessert to share. Either way it's still a very good deal.  Here's the catch. The food is good, we typically get decent service, but without the coupons it wouldn't be worth it. They typically provide a \"before\" and \"after\" bill and today's meal would have been almost $45. With the coupon it was only $28.   Next time we're going to try Happy Hour. The menu looked to have a good selection and the prices seemed reasonable."}
{"text":"Manager - Trent Server - Lucy   Great atmosphere with great service. I went there with my girlfriend to celebrate my promotion. It started off great there lettuce wraps are the best. Unfortunately the food I ordered didn't mention it had mushrooms which I'm allergic too, it sucked cause it looked absolutely amazing the teriyaki chicken. I notified my server Lucy and she took care of it right away super apologetic. The manager over heard and immediately jumped in offering suggestions for different meals. They were awesome even though it wasn't there fault but was at the same time they made it right. I ended up getting the cowboy stake and wow it was fantastic just melted in your mouth definitely a must try. Also my gf got the pub burger and that thing was huge she only was able to eat three bites and she was forcing it down cause how great it tasted. Highly recommend visiting great place great people. Great pizookie."}
{"text":"The interior of this restaurant reminds me of an upscale Outback Steakhouse. Walking in, we were led to our table by a stern face hostess who acted as though I was bothering her when I asked what the happy hours were for today. Minus one star.  My sister and I shared a Macau shrimp and noodle soup. In addition, I ordered a red sangria and coconut shrimp skewers while she ordered a Mai Tai and BBQ Ribs.   Do people in Macau eat their soup laden in sugar or what, because this soup was unusually sweet unlike any other Asian soup I've ever tried in my life. Oh, and I'm Asian, by the way, so I've tried bowls of Asian noodle soup amidst many. My friend who is Swiss thoroughly enjoyed this noodle soup, as she excitedly exclaimed to us that this is her favorite soup at this place. Perhaps my sister and I differ in taste in comparison to the general populace when it comes to noodle soup. Regardless, this isn't the typical Asian soup that we expected it to be. Minus another star.  Her BBQ ribs came with a small cup of deliciously warm slices of cooked apple, a pile of coleslaw and regular plus sweet potato fries. This entire entree is very good. My coconut shrimp skewers were also excellent.  The star of the night for me is the red sangria. All of the ingredients in this drink were so perfect in ratio, between the fruit, the ice and the amount of liquor. I'd come back here for happy hours!"}
{"text":"Generally shunning chains in favor of local novelties, Elephant Bar vaguely known as a failed branch once occupied space at a local mall back home, it was on the invitation of Rosie Gillam that three friends sat down to taste the restaurant's newly debuted Brunch menu, conditions that an honest opinion be offered based on the overall experience with a particular focus on the food.  Unabashedly rooted in its theme, a large pachyderm and giraffe statues overlooking the foyer as well as the adjoining bar, Elephant Bar Henderson is located in The District at Green Valley Ranch at the end nearest the Casino and managed by Mr. Mike Tuttle who has overseen operations at several locations over the course of a dozen years, there is little doubt that management long-ago learned to take care of its employees, our waitress a nine year veteran despite her young age while several others have worked nearly a decade at the space.  Genuinely a happy feeling family eatery, the global cuisine admittedly all over the place with obvious \"something for everyone\" intent, a first look at the Elephant Bar menu reads much less elaborately than other chains looking to sell their items with hyperbole, signatures and dietary discretions indicated by icons with additional verbiage limited to method and content.  Bopping IHeartRadio standards, volumeless ESPN on screens in the Bar, it was with warm greetings from a server prone to \"Hun\" and \"My Lady\" that the table was greeted and with suggestions for signatures offered an order was composed to take place in three courses, a total of eleven plates showing far better than many have suggested though a few of the newer selections certainly need to be tweaked or reworked.  Starting out with \"Shareables,\" plenty of coffee, water and iced tea  refilled readily while the table dined and conversed with Mr.Tuttle, first bites of French Onion Ribeye Sliders showed a decent grade of meat topped in Swiss Cheese with caramelized Onions, the 'au jus' a bit oversalted and mostly unnecessary while sauces accompanying the Crispy Green Beans and Coconut Shrimp were equally flavor-marring, the parmesan crust alone making the former irresistibly crave-worthy while the later was already quite sweet without the \"Pan-Pacific\" sauce included for dipping.  Looking at Braised Lamb Shank as a bold move for such a restaurant, their 2014 bankruptcy and subsequent purchase by Chalak Mitra group no doubt contributing several flavors familiar to Southern Asia and India to the spread, it was on the strong words of Mike that the re-launched lunch optioned was ordered and with a falling-from-the bone texture combined to a deep sapor it turns out that the General Manager was spot-on in his recommendation, each bite as rich as expected with necessary levity added by steamed spinach.  Impressed by the Angus burger with Blue Cheese and Pears, the beef soon to be upgraded to Prime per management, items from the Brunch Section were soon delivered in the form of a duo, the Raspberry Passion Pancakes fluffy with buttermilk flavors that help to prevent passion fruit from overwhelming while the Sunrise Breakfast Tostadas are unfortunately *far* to rich to be enjoyable, the tortillas holding up better than the table's tastebuds to the mixture of bacon, peppers, onions, eggs and layer-upon-layer of thick, salty cheese.  Informing the GM and waitstaff of the Tostadas' issues, the comments appearing to be taken seriously and passed on to the Chef, dessert was composed of two Elephant Bar Signatures plus the Brunch-Only French Toast-Butter Cake Sandwich - the Cobbler and Cast-Iron Cookie each hitting all the right notes beneath melting ice cream while thin slices of Cream-Cheese infused cake were mostly lost between bread, the Gooey greatness better appreciated in the classic preparation with toffee sauce and ice cream adding even more richness.  Admitting up front that national chains are not frequently a part of the dining agenda, menu prices alone amusing considering the higher cost generally involved in weekend plans, Elephant Bar suffers many of the flaws frequently associated with such places by attempting to be \"everything to everyone,\" but at the same time manages to execute some pretty complex flavors with a service staff that outperforms many \"celebrity\" spots on the Strip.  Sure the sauces, seasoning and sodium content can tend to be overwhelming, but when taken as a whole there is no doubt that the menu executes better than others in its genre, particularly as relates to plates bearing \"signature\" status."}
{"text":"A nice restaurant to grab Happy Hour in the Green Valley Area.  Environment: Located at the District in Green Valley, the outside ambience is very nice. As for the interior, I have only ever sat in the bar/ lounge area, however the restaurant seems to have a nice, open floorplan with adequate interior decorating. The bar is off to the left upon entering and is designed as a circular space, with the bar in the center which is nice in that the bartenders can easily see everyone, even those sitting at the high-top tables against the walls.  Food: The menu offers a lot of variety, from grilled dishes, seafood, bar-style tapas, and Asian fusion. I have tried the tuna tataki, calamari, lettuce wraps, artichoke dip, salmon tempura roll, and potato skins. Some dishes are better than others but upon repeat visits I have been able to find a couple dishes I love despite the trial and error.   Service: Service is always good as well, even with the shorter staff available late at night for the happy hour, the bartender is always sure to be checking up on everyone and making sure that everyone's waters are refilled and asking if we would like another round of drinks.  Overall this is a great spot to grab some late night happy hour or for a quick bite before some gambling or a movie at the Green Valley Ranch Casino."}
{"text":"I came here for something new with the wife back in May. She had never been, but I had some time ago.  She had their summer special salmon and I had their summer special steak. We both drew the same conclusions -  their chefs know how to cook meat and cook it to perfection!   However, the rest of the meal was lackluster. The garlic bread was good for the short time it was warm. After that tasted very stale.  The veggies were honestly just plain wrong. The flavor seemed off, they were undercooked, and they just didn't do it for either of us.  The rice - well, it's hard to screw up rice. Luckily that was good and the amount made up for the lack of food in our bellies from the rest of the meal.  The atmosphere was so cold that our food chilled off really quickly, which also aided in making it an unpleasant meal.  I wish I could say I'd return, but I really doubt it will happen.  Edit: After posting this review I received an email from management requesting for further feedback. I was promised a call from the regional manager and after several months I still have not gotten that call."}
{"text":"I hate giving three stars but the only good thing about this restaurant is their cocktails and waiters. We were sat down in a timely fashion and our food came out quickly. We had the calamari as an appetizer, which was bland and tastes no where close to fresh. I had the Mongolian beef which was mediocre, not very flavorful and my boyfriend had the ribs and teriyaki chicken which he also said was nothing special. I definitely wouldn't go back for the food, definitely over priced. But their Mai tai and tropical rum cocktail were great!"}
{"text":"The service here was really friendly, but on the slow side. I ordered the chicken teriyaki, and it was just OK. The chicken wasn't bad, but wasn't great, either. The rice was flavorless. My dad ordered the pastrami sandwich and loved it, though. I don't live in the area, but am there often, so if I have an occasion to go back to Elephant Bar, I'd be fine doing so, but I'd order something else."}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday evening and ordered  1. 2 Mango Swirls, 4.50ea 2. Artichoke dip and chips  3. Kona BBQ ribs  4. Crispy shrimp and white rice  for $37 (Used the 2 for $20 coupon that I received in the mail)   - Seated right away. Hostess was pleasant.  - Dining area very clean. Comfortable seating  - Server was very nice.  - We ordered one Mango Swirl, but she instead gave us 2. Didn't really feel like disputing since the drink was so delicious. haha.  - Artichoke dip was average. Needs more artichoke. Not enough chips. We asked the server that handed our food for more chips and she said okay, but never came back with them. fail. Wasted dip.  - Kona BBQ was exquisite. Loved how tender it was. Needs a bit more BBQ sauce. Not finger-licking enough. The meal also came with peach cobbler, fries, and cole slaw.  - There was a mix of potato and sweet potato fries. Not fresh, but not old. Could be better.  - Shrimp and rice was good. Reminded me of Pei Wei. Rice a bit harder than normal. Needs more water or change it to 3 ladies. haha.  - Portion was enough for the dine. No extra.  - Pleasant meal. Great location. Will come back with coupons. Rewards membership available."}
{"text":"Beer was cold and the happy hour prices are good. Enjoyed the nachos. Only down side was the ladies restroom could use some work. Messy and the toilet seat liners were empty. Stall a little small."}
{"text":"New menu. Nice choices. I enjoyed the pot roast.  Went back for it a second time. You have to like dark gravy , potted meat over  mashed potatoes and some veggies for this dish. I do. My wife enjoyed a salmon and veggie dish. No"}
{"text":"I went here for a teenager's birthday celebration since she likes it here. Fried green beans and a global sampler were ordered as appetizers which was too much food if you ask me. Their menu has way too many selections - I was overwhelmed and got full just by looking at it.  Global Sampler: Includes coconut shrimp skewers, chicken fingers, sweet potato fries (for an additional $3), artichoke dip and bruschetta. It's recommended for 4 people but it was plenty enough for our group of 8. 3.5/5   Fried Green Beans: Comes with a dipping sauce. Lightly breaded green beans. 3.5/5  Island Tilapia: Broiled tilapia sprinkled with island spice blend. Comes with green beans, fennel and rice with Andouille sausage and salsa. I enjoyed the first few bites but got tired of this dish rather quickly. 3/5  The service was better than the food. I enjoyed the unlimited strawberry lemonade though."}
{"text":"Yikes! What happened to Elephant Bar? It used to a be a really good restaurant with a great menu. There's used to be a lot of variety and selection. The menu has now been downsized and there are no more pictures. We came in on a late Saturday afternoon and there were a few people sitting at the bar and only ONE table in the dining room. That didn't seem like a good sign but we ordered anyways. My boyfriend got the Korean Beef tacos and the mango salsa on the plate tasted rancid. I got the chicken marsala and it had a weird taste to it. It definitely didn't taste like a wine sauce. More like a gravy with a weird spice that was overpowering everything. When we left I immediately felt like throwing up and had really bad acid reflux, which NEVER happens to me. Needless to say, we probably won't be returning. Now I see why a lot of them closed down in California. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant, and all it had to offer.  The decor and atmosphere is intimate and romantic - dim lighting, cool African-safari-themed art on the walls, etc.  I had the Gardenburger and sweet potato fries for my meal, and it was completely delicious.  I also ordered a mojito - and, as I say, I've never met a mojito I didn't like; this one was particularly delicious!  Although there's a specific recipe on the menu, they'll flavor-infuse your mojito with any number of fruit options; I chose pomegranate, and it was Amazing.  The waitress was very friendly, provided recommendations for us, and was very attentive to us the entire time we were there.  I never got to the bottom of my glass of water (in my mind, a clear sign of great service!).  In addition, the street surrounding this restaurant is beautiful and intimate, especially at night; lights strung from tree to tree, brick street, and classy shopping and eating venues.  (Definitely a fantastic date option!)  Can't wait to come back here again!"}
{"text":"A lazy Sunday lunch calls for the elephant bar!! The drinks are strong but not overbearing, the olu passion mai tai is just yummy!! But the mojito comes in a close second. They have a wide variety of choies- I've only sampled a couple of them- the misoyaki salmon is rich. And the Yalkisoba noodles are another level. SERIOUSLY. The macau shrimp and noodles, lemon garlic chicken breast are all solid choices too. I will say that my favorite pick is always the Korean street tacos. I just can't get over the delish combinations of the marinade, sour cream, avocado, cabbage, and that outstanding salsa. With brown rice? Yum!   It's pretty obvious that I really enjoy coming here but I don't usually care for the really dark ambience, the outdated upholstery on the booths and chairs, or how there is usually one person for the whole floor of the restaurant. We've been there time and time again and it's always the same test of patience. But when my friends and i go, we'll go with our tummies just about hungry. So it's okay. Happy hour is good, and they're adding more and more lunch specials and brunch specials. I'll be at the elephant bar, just with more initial thirst than hunger."}
{"text":"Forgetful Elephant  On an unusually busy, non-holiday Monday, I entered the Elephant Bar Restaurant in Peoria AZ and was greeted by...no one. For a good five minutes. Sure, employees passed by, even ones that looked like managers. Not a single person acknowledged me. I'm not prissy by any means, but this does not fare well with me. At all.  Two of my family members, Mother and her sister, arrived right on time after the five minutes were up, and believe it, they were attended to. (Granted, I'm 37 and they're a little older and women, but customer service dictates: Even if you're prejudiced, biased, sexist, old-fashioned, homophobic or all of the above - YOU DON'T SHOW IT to the people who are paying your bills.)  Nevertheless, we were sat, and the waitress was a tad bit nice up front - when she arrived 10 minutes following us being sat, that is. Then, she was thoroughly confrontational with my mother when she produced a coupon for \"buy-one-get-one-free\" and wanted to combine that with a senior discount card. It was almost a game for the waitress to state multiple ways of telling her \"No\" on using two offers. Then, when my mother offered to separate me and her check and my Aunt's bill, the waitress's sly remark was: \"Oh, well, you didn't tell me that.\" Never did she apologize for policy and try to make amends in other ways. Heck, even \"I'm so sorry, but I can only accept one discount. Let's see which one would be best for you\" would've been the most appropriate response for a policy that \"cannot\" be altered.   I will say, jumping ahead, the waitress did soften as the meal went along. So, I'm not 100% bashing her, I'm just saying in order to get the tip she's there for, she needs to put herself in our shoes, or at least, take some customer service classes.  We ordered. I had a major 2-day craving for real-no-box Mac'N'Cheese and lo...they had it all over their menu! 'Course, you have to pay more to substitute fries for it, but still I had a pregnancy-like yearning for it! So, I got that and the so-called Ultimate Bacon Burger. Let me tell you, a real, well-made hamburger is my #2 all-time favorite food, so I'm usually picky. This was average at best. It wasn't terrible, it was just okay. It was very messy - and this is coming from a clean freak that disavowed those Carl's Jr. \"If it doesn't get all over the place, it doesn't belong in your face\" campaigns.  Oh, and the Mac'N'Cheese wasn't bad, but it wasn't exciting despite the bread crumbs they added and all the multiple advertisements they gave it. Better than the 33 cent box kind, oh, hell yeah, but not something I would pay too much for.  Like the other chained \"Elephant Bars,\" the ambiance is nice. If they're going for the Rainforest Café or Claim Jumper crowds, they're in 5-6th place. My biggest concern was the lack of friendly, attentive and concerned staff members. Even as we were leaving, a younger male, probably early 20's, was applying for a job. I almost told him: \"Hey, buddy, despite the economy, you should still aim higher.\""}
{"text":"Decent for what it is - Solid 3 Stars!  Elephant Bar is a chain restaurant that caters to \"Global Cuisine\".  Atmosphere seems as if you're on a safari, dim lighting and animal-esque motifs surrounding you.   Came here for lunch with my grandma (FYI = if you're a senior, you can sign up for their discount program, allowing you to get 20% off your bill!) because she was craving their \"LETTUCE WRAPS\", which I must say was decent.   For those of you on a diet or just watching what you eat, they offer a \"lighter side\" on their menu options. I don't understand why this section of the menu is placed towards the back where the desserts and beverages are listed. Oh well! I had opted for the Quick Seared Ahi Tuna Salad (in their lighter side menu) which was quite filling for a huge plate of salad! My Ahi Tuna was cooked just right.   Service here was great! I wasn't ignored, yet smothered.   Overall, the food is okay. Nothing \"OMG\" about, but decent for the price you pay.  Nonetheless, only going here if my grandma want's to go. Or if I have friends that feel like going to the bar!"}
{"text":"I know there is an EB restaurant in Burbank,but I got to try it in AZ first. I loved my shrimp scampi dinner with amazing lobster sauce.  My bf had the fried shrimp plate that was small and more like for lunch then dinner. The waiter was a nerd but he was very good at his job, and i liked him! The decor was cool I liked it. The only negative thing was when we first got there they tried to sit us at a small table when there was a huge booth open, we had a group of 6."}
{"text":"The lunch Chicken Marsala was just ok. Chicken was dry, but it was only $8.95  Loved the coconut shrimp side, especially for only $3.99  Not sure I can recommend their Cobb Salad. The dish served on is not meant to toss a salad in, so if you like your Cobb tossed, ask them to toss it before bringing it to your table.  The side of 4 ribs was a value for only $3.99  The best part of this experience was Mike, our waiter.  Helpful and attentive, above and beyond.  I really appreciated his assistance with my daughter & granddaughter."}
{"text":"Elephant Bar is one of those restaurants where I would only go to during happy hour. There are a few stipulations, so pay attention. Happy hour deals only apply if you sit at the bar. They have two set times, Monday through Friday from 3pm to 7pm and another one everyday from 9pm to close.   The bartender does not make chit-chat, but she got the job done. With running a bar and the dining area surrounding it, I cannot hold it against her.  The drinks range from two dollars for non-alcoholic cocktails to six dollar specialty drinks. If you like well drinks then they will run you three dollars.   The food runs from three to six dollars. The most expensive appetizers are the coconut shrimp and the seared ahi tuna. Both dishes are worth the price. If they cost more, I might not have thought so. The ahi tuna comes with a refreshing salad consisting of bitter greens, sprouts, cucumbers, carrots, and topped with seaweed salad. It is accompanied by ponzu sauce. Without that, or soy sauce, the dish would be on the dry side. I love raw ahi, so the texture of the seared outside could be the reason for my complaint. We also got an order of the sweet potato fries. They are nothing out of the ordinary. Crisp, not greasy, but lacked a contrast. It needed a light dusting of sea salt and a tangy sauce to give a more bold flavor. Bachi Burger offers the best version of this tuber for that exact reason."}
{"text":"I've been here before and thought it was okay, but we have never gone back because it wasn't worth it. I wouldn't have gone this time but a group of friends wanted to get together, and they picked Elephant Bar. I almost didn't go, but I was willing to take one for the team in order to see some friends. Drinks are okay but pricey. Staff was really pleasant and handled our large table beautifully. We shared some Seared Ahi Tuna apps, it was a little dry and not quality but it was edible. I ordered the Crispy Orange Shrimp with rice, the flavor was there but the shrimp were not crispy, and the rice was bad...I can tell it's been sitting in a container drying out and clumping. Yuck. My husband got the NY Steak sandwich, (it doesn't come with a top bun) and about 10 fries. He ate it and said it was okay, not the best he had but he would eat it again. Oh well, third time will not be the charm unless they drag me in there kicking and screaming."}
{"text":"ribeye...sad...fried green beans....tasteless......not good...yuk...."}
{"text":"I wanted to like you. But you gave me too many choices. And when you do that, like a kid in a candy store, I'm distracted big time. When that happens, I order a burger on a menu filled with at least 5 different cuisines. At a place called the Elephant Bar Restaurant. Huh? I had the Santa Barbara burger for one reason only: avocado. What a disappointment. Not ripe. So, tasteless. The burger itself was fine, but nothing extra. Came with some salty, semi-soggy fries. Again, maybe that's what I get for ordering a burger @ the Elephant. Maybe I should have ordered elephant."}
{"text":"I am not really sure what to say about Elephant Bar. When I think about it my mind just goes blank. Vanilla, bland, neutral, uneventful... just there.  Given that, it is a decent place to just stop over for a quick bite while shopping or before a movie and I find myself there every so often just because it is convenient and close. They do have pretty good happy hour specials (food and drink), but as is my problem with many places in Vegas their food is the definition of corporate. It could be the exact same recipes from Claim Jumper, Cheesecake Factory, Applebee's or any other 'New American'-style chain. I wont hate them for it, but dont expect any amazing culinary surprises.  As for the drinks, I have to say they are decent. The male bartender who always happens to be there when I go (admission: I always sit in the bar... its closer to the alcohol) is always friendly enough and makes a good drink. The atmosphere is low-key enough that you can sit and have a pretty in-depth conversation without anyone bothering you which rates high in my book. Overall a good place for drinks, decent place for food, but not a destination."}
{"text":"Had dinner here recently with 3 other adults. Service was quick, attentive. Good menu selection. Good drinks selection as well. We had the carmalized pear burger and the lamb chops. Both were very good. We declined dessert offers, but there were good selections.  would definitely eat here again.\""}
{"text":"Edgar our server was amazing super friendly! I have been here before but today was a memorable experience! He offered us everything and asked all the right questions to make our dinner great! Best personality ever! He continued to ask if everything was ok and what he could do for us! Great place dinner was delicious! The Chicken Marsala was amazing I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My sister and her boyfriend took my husband and I out for dinner and drinks to celebrate my husbands birthday. We told the hostess who seated us. It took 30 minutes to get our drinks. The food menu was way to big. Appetizers were messy and the dip was room tempature, yuk! The food is not anything to write home about, they might as well be a sports bar, because all they did well was the fried stuff. My sister hated her dish, and to top it all off they never recognized my husbands birthday, which was why we went there in the first place. We went ahead and ordered a dessert so we could all share, the waitress brings 6 forks and 6 spoons and no extra plates or napkins. Needless to say, we will NOT be going back!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Ambience was really cool. The Botha were large, comfy, and private. Went for a lunch meeting and it was perfect setting. We both enjoyed our meals. The desserts looked amazing, but we didn't save any more. Next time I will. Waitress was speedy and friendly. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and have had different experiences every time. The service is ok. It could be better but that doesn't really bother me since every time I come here i'm usually not by myself. The food is really good but the prices could be a little better. The portions are really big (like The Cheesecake Factory) so sharing meals is probably a good idea if you are coming here with any little kids. Other than that this place is easy to find and there is always tons of parking. I've never had to wait for a table since i've only been here for lunch so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Food good ..... World sampler nice variety !!! Coconut shrimp the best chicken tenders always good !!!! Mud pie ridiculous !!! All and all good experience !!! Made a mistake on my order manager came and apologized !!! Service keep them from 5 star experience !!! Good but not great !!! Positive overall will return !!!"}
{"text":"The service was fine. Our group of 14 had lunch today. I ordered a Cobb Salad. The Salad came and the bowl the salad was in was filthy. I showed the server and gave her the bowl. She returned with the same salad in a new bowl.  Terrible way to treat a guest.  Will not be returning"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good.  i got the BBQ \"sampler plate\" and the wife got the Ahi Tuna.  The tuna was pretty good and sushi grade.  I liked the variety that was given on the sampler plate and it defiantly was a good amount of food.  The rice on the tuna was eh. They apparently season it with vinegar which I and my wife did not like.   The Mac and Cheese was stale tasting like it was made early in the day was put in the fridge and then microwaved.  The waiter agreed about that but didnt take it off the bill.  There are a lot of food choices here so there should not be a problem feeding a small or large group or even kids. We would giv eit a second chance."}
{"text":"Run. Not to, but away from this Elephant. Pretend it's a real elephant and it's scary and chasing you. That's how fast you should run. While I've had friendly, if not efficient service. It's the lame food. I've seriously had better things from Stouffer's. Sauces are thick and sugary. Drinks are overly sweet and not nearly enough booze to shmooze. After the Jordin Sparks party at SKYE we met some friends who said they would be here. I sighed. Or did I cry. I forget. But we gave it a shot. It was 10:00 pm and the place was an elephant morgue. Seriously the only guests were our friends. We were immediately told we could have no food and only one drink. Ahhh! Really? How hospitable! A quick shot of Patron and a visit to the elephant pottie and we split."}
{"text":"A quick note. Still a great bar with a great bartender Jeremiah. Efficient but not overbearing. Thanks."}
{"text":"Asian Fusion cuisine with casual atmosphere & full bar. Decent lighting and nice wok or fire-grilled choices on the menu, also gluten-free. Food presentation was very nice. They have senior discount which is great! Chopsticks are available on the table. Prices are reasonable to high for all courses. Some substitutions cost extra but the manager was accommodating and made the exchange without the extra charge. I had soup with shrimp and noodles which was very tasty and the portions are large. I also started with the chicken lettuce wraps which was nice. My companions had miso salmon and the crusted chicken and pasta respectively. All were satisfied, but it's not a place we are running back to. It's not a family place and I found the build your own hamburger procedure on the menu annoying and tedious to read and follow."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, delicious food and a staff with a good attitude.  I got the Miso Yaki salmon and aboslutely loved it!"}
{"text":"Nice place, variety of food.  Excellent service.  The menu is a little long and several pages.  It was nice to see the managers making sure the food was going out correctly before the customer received it."}
{"text":"I really like this place! It's one of those forgotten gems. You eat here and you say, \"Man! This place is really great!\" Then months pass and you forget that it exists. At least for me.  I have been visiting this place more often now. I often have business lunches and they always suggest another more popular restaurant nearby. Just recently I have been suggesting Elephant Bar. It hasn't let me down yet. Great mixture of dining and you can mix it up with a burger if you want. Salmon is also on the menu.   If you are with a group and no one can agree upon what they have a taste for, this is the spot. Only here can someone order salmon, burger and fries and Mongolian Beef under the same roof. What's not to like about that?"}
{"text":"What I like: MisoYaki Firegrilled Salmon. Love it, love it, love it. To me, this one dish is worth it.   What I also like: The decor. Incredibly cliche but it's fun.  What I don't like: I feel like I'm constantly waiting. The last time I went there was 11 of us, so I will grant them that there was a ton of us, but it seriously took forever for the food, for the desert, for the check. It was pretty crazy. But even when it's just me and my husband, the service always seems slow.  Plus, it is pricey for what it is.  But it's definitely something to check out."}
{"text":"Some friends and I came here recently for a little late lunch. It was a warm but breezy afternoon and we sat outside. I really liked the area- it's right across from Green Valley Ranch in one of those village-looking outdoor shopping centers.  This means the surroundings were pleasant to look at and there wasn't a ton of car traffic.   I can't say I was impressed by what I ate.  I had salmon sushi and it wasn't all that. To be fair, I'm not a fan of warm sushi. Room temperature is good for me, but at least the salmon was freshly cooked, right?  I ordered a wedge salad and was sorely disappointed to the point of not even eating all of it.  Heck, I can hack a head of iceberg lettuce in half and throw some blue cheese next to it for much cheaper.  Not worth the price.  My meal was actually not memorable.    Would I come back? I would definitely give it another try because the service was nice and the surroundings were pleasant. I'd like to try the dining room, as it looked nicely put together.  I hope the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"The food is not memorable, but the drinks are yummy.  My recommendation is to hit the bar only or for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Fair neighborhood restaurant with good value for the money. The open kitchen creates a good feeling regarding the preparation of the food. They also have some interesting internationally inspired dishes on the menu. However, they changed the menu and reduced the vegetarian options significantly, which is a drawback for me.  But I love the cozy ambience of the cool separate booths!  Edit: Ever since they changed the menu I really do not know anymore what to eat there. Before I had some favorite items such as the (Vegetarian) Burger that you could put together in 5 steps of your choice. I really hope they will update their menu soon again!"}
{"text":"Jose is the best bar tender I have ever ran into.  If you stop in ask for him.  Their food is absolutely amazing and their prices are great! I love bringing my friends here, anniversary dinners are awesome here. I come here at least three times a month and I have a great time with all of the servers here. What a great team! Always impressed with the service!"}
{"text":"I had an okay Cobb salad for lunch today, along with a glass of wine. I'm not a big fan of laminated menus, but they did have a decent selection of dishes. It has a TGI Friday's kind of vibe. Not haute cuisine, but it's keeping it real. The service was very good."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great and i can see it being good for bar fun.....other than that...So so food......tried the shrimp platter ...ugh yea not that great. The fried green beans were good and the garlic bread. The menu for salmon had Atlantic....not good folks....Atlantic salmon is bad for you. So my recomendation is to stay away from ordering sea food here."}
{"text":"Wow, I am kinda suprised by the recent reviews of this place. My girlfriend loves this place and has been going for the past 5+ years. She would probably give it 5 stars. I really like this place, the atmosphere, we always get great service. The food is really, really good and the prices aren't bad. Sometimes, very crowded, but haven't ever waited too long. We love going back and can't wait till our next visit."}
{"text":"I had the spinach artichoke dip and chicken potstickers as appetizers. Both were really good. I ordered the Farm House Chicken. It was really good. The green beans it came with were really good too. My mom ordered Chicken Marsala and she loved that as well."}
{"text":"Great Eats and great service. Will definitely come back. Alot more to try. Taste proves quality."}
{"text":"Meh. My boyfriend and I came here during spring training since it was so close to our hotel. However, I'm sure everyone else thought this as well as the restaurant was super busy (also I guess happy hour just ended). Anyway, our server was awful. She was the most unenthused lady I meant on the entire trip.   My boyfriend ordered a coke and I order a raspberry lemon drop martini, my martini was delicious but I waited about 20 minutes for it (no exaggeration) and my boyfriend drank the coke within a few minutes since AZ is so hot! And didn't get a refill until after we got our appetizer. Our appetizer plate NEVER left the table and was there to crowd our main dishes when they arrived. I got the mahi mahi sandwich which was quite tasty, my boyfriend got a burger and said it was horribly bland- not to mention he only got his soda refilled one time. Come on.  The nicest thing our server said to us was \"take your time\" when we got the check. I understand the busyness of a restaurant but you need to be SEMI interested in the customers.   Would I go back? Only because the elephant on the wall was cool to take pictures with."}
{"text":"Food and service was amazing Saturday night. Had the tuna appetizer and grilled chicken. Loved the tuna so much, had to order a second! Friendly, helpful wait staff."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite places in town... early afternoons are great if you don't like crowds. Maybe a handful of people at best, which is a breath of fresh air considering how crowded restaurants can be in Vegas. Danielle was our server today, and her service alone made this review 5 stars. Her engagement with us was outstanding. Will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Kung pao shrimp looked alot better in the picture, everything else is just typical asian fusion. Ordered several dishes(shrimp, macademia nut crusted chicken, stirfry, salad..), the pictures on menu made it look alot better than how it look like in reality and taste wise....not good. Nothing about this restaurant was phenomenal~"}
{"text":"Consistently good food and service, a destination when we are visiting the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Had dinner with a friend and Danielle was awesome. From the appetizer to the main course to the cocktails, everything is really good....I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I just stopped by here for drinks.  The bartender was good and the drinks were decent.  The partially separate restaurant is huge.  I would say just judging by appearances this is a high end Applebee's."}
{"text":"Went for third anniversary. Got lettuce wraps, orange chicken, and soba noodles. Wraps were bland and cilantro sauce that came with it was very strange...not in a good way.  Had a guy at booth next to us literally screaming at others tables, three times, and never saw management intervene. Not the place we expected. Next time will just go to PA Change next door."}
{"text":"The Elephant Bar is a place that I visit when other people make the choice to eat here.  It's in Henderson and popular with the work friends because we just head over after the work whistle blows.  I came here for dinner recently and as is usual for me, I searched their menu online beforehand to see if there was nutrition info available and there was.  I decided that I would either go with their chicken lettuce wraps or the petite sirloin, based on calories and protein content.  They happen to have a gluten-free menu as well as a \"lighter\" menu, which I appreciate.  Once there, my friends and I had great service from our waiter the whole time.  I went with the petite sirloin, which came with vegetables and a parmesan baked potato for only 450 calories and 36 g of protein--right up my alley.  It was a tasty meal and I was more than impressed with it since I didn't know if it was going to be good or not.  This is only the second time I've been here in maybe a year.  Between them, my friends had the mongolian beef and the shrimp and crab louie salad, with the mongolian beef looking like something I'd try the next time.  The pals also had a coupon for free strawberry shortcake with the purchase of two entrees and I had a sample taste of that:  delicious!  The bill came to $43, without the dessert being charged--not bad at all for three people.  Overall, this place has a lot of options on its menu, enough to satisfy everyone's palates and dietary needs.  I hear the happy hour is great, so I'll have to return and check that out sometime."}
{"text":"We were greeted with a friendly smile. Our server was attentive and made wonderful menu selections. I ordered the Turkey melt and my friend ordered the Thai High salad. Both dishes were fantastic. I was somewhat skeptical at first about trying out this restaurant based on reviews and lack of patrons inside (it was on a Saturday at 12:30pm). I'm glad I tried this place and will return."}
{"text":"Food and prices were awesome! Decor is very nice, a little dark though, especially when trying to read a menu!  Over all I think this is a nice family restaurant!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm even giving this a star is because our server was nice and friendly. I live near the District so I have tried the Elephant Bar on several occasions. I don't know what the problem is but the food is just not good. The chicken seems to have some sort of seasoning on it  and tasted chewy and disgusting in my salad.  I thought maybe it's just me but someone else in our party had the same salad which looked completely different and he thought the same thing.  It's in a great location but I anticipate this restaurant closing soon as on a Saturday night it was almost totally empty.  No one in our 11 person group really enjoyed their meal. They need some help in there evaluating their food!"}
{"text":"There's a couple reasons why we have stopped going here. The service is slow. We were there on a Tuesday evening. We usually sit at the high tops at the bar. We've had the same server a couple times now, Chelsea. I'm sorry, but she is slow, forgetful, and never checks in. It wasn't like the place was busy. The food has also been hit or miss. I used to love the chimchurri burger, except when there's no chimchurri on it. Appetizers should be served hot and before a meal, not at the same time as your meal, and who likes cold spinach artichoke dip?? No thanks."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times. Mostly lunch hour or afternoon. Tonight decided to make a dinner run at 6:00 pm. The wait for a table was nearly 30 minutes, not bad for Friday dinner hour. When we were finally seated the place was half empty. What the hell??? All these empty tables and a 30 minute wait???Makes no sense to me. Server said it was normal to be this way on Friday. (2) of us. We each ordered a bowl of French Onion Soup. Then we ordered 3 appetisers to split. The soup was not bad. Have had better but it was OK. The appetisers were not good. No Flavors. We split the lettuce wraps. The lettuce used was not right. It was all stuck together and tore up when we tried to seperate it. The sauces were very bland.  Waitress said the peanut sauce was spicey. However we found it had no flavor no heat. The parmesean grean beans were bland. No flavor. Worthless food. The wait staff was horrible. Not responsive. Finally a manager came by and we asked for drink refils and extra sauce. He was more service than our waitress. The only treat we got was when we got the bill. The appetisers were half price so the bill was much less than I had expected. Shape up Elephant Bar. You have a great location and you can ruin it very easy."}
{"text":"Ever in the Henderson area and looking for a place to eat...? Definitely stop by this restaurant, it's worth it!   I went for lunch on a nice day in Vegas ( not too hot, nor to cold). I sat outside which their seating outside provides a great view, spacious tables, and temperature control. All which make eating outside very pleasurable.   Their menu provides a great selection and pricing is average. I was on an all vegan diet, which was not a big problem for their chef to work with. I ordered soba noodles with vegetable stir fry and tofu. 100% vegan. Most people think of vegan as a flavorless meal, this entree was the complete opposite. It was flavorable enough that for those that are non-vegan, I recommend to try.   Overall if you are strolling around The District I recommend you to stop by. If the weather is nice, try eating outside. Have specific needs? The employees (especially our host Brandon) was understanding and went out of his way to make my experience pleasurable."}
{"text":"Happy hour prices are good! I like how they have happy hour prices on the weekend.  Service could have been better. Location is great. Facility is clean and friendly staff. If your around the area give this place a trym"}
{"text":"I went here with my mom and sister in law today for happy hour. I must say.... I don't understand why people say this place is so good. Even my mom was raving about it as we left and I do not understand it. We got a ton of food, calamari, artichoke dip, pretzel sticks, chicken lettuce wraps, and my mom got a burger. The calamari was probably the best thing, it was a little spicy and had a nice enough flavor. The artichoke was nasty, if this wasn't frozen I would be shocked. It tasted like it had some of the lowest grade cheese (or processed cheese) and had a weird plastic look and texture. The pretzel sticks were dry and bland. The lettuce wraps were also bland.... the peanut sauce that came with it made it better, but not by a whole lot. The lettuce wraps are better at PF Changs and Cheesecake factory... and I don't like either of those restaurants. My mom liked her burger. I didn't try it. Overall it was a lackluster and bland experience. If I had the choice, I would not eat here again.   PS there was a lady with a screaming toddler in the bar area and this older lady turned around and told her off..... it was definitely the highlight of the meal."}
{"text":"Disappointed by the limited menu items, however the entree items were good and tasty. The restaurant decor was kind of tired and needs a refresh.   Thee e-cookie and service was great."}
{"text":"I would have to agree with the star rating. This is very nice establishment with average food. The prices are reasonable and they do offer a free appetizer if you sign up for the loyalty card (took about 3 mins to do) I ordered a mojito to start, it was decent but not made fresh ( I could tell it was a mix) We also had the spinach and artichoke dip as our appetizer along with an order of sweet potato fries the dip was very bland and the fries we fine, the rest of dinner was pretty much the same. It was good but nothing that would bring me back for a second visit. The service was good and the food is okay if that's what your looking for. I personally like my food to have a little more character.     I would come back if invited but probably by choice. I feel this area has so much more to offer as far as food choices are concern. Thanks for an average dinner but I'll take my money else where."}
{"text":"I went here with Justin G. on 1/26/13 because we were bored and I guess, hungry. Justin suggested this place because he had never been, I acquiesced, although I tried to persuade Justin not to go, because there was nothing else really open after 10 PM by where we live.   When we walked in, servers were sitting in booths eating. We stood at the hostess station for a bit until one of the servers noticed us and told us the dining room was closed but we could sit at the bar.  Okay, we showed ourselves to a table and went over the happy hour menu. We got sweet potato fries, macaroni and cheese, chicken and Justin got a hamburger for himself. The food was okay but our waitress was all over the place. She had a large table and spent most of the night yaking with the people at the table. That was pretty annoying. Justin had to go over to the bar multiple times to ask for the sauce that was supposed to come with his food, napkins, refills and when the meal was over, the check.   I guess our waitress saw him ask for the check because she came rushing over and said that \"omg, they (her customers) wouldn't shut up. SO annoying.\" That made me just feel uncomfortable because they were in earshot and, well, that's pretty unprofessional when she's leaning on the wall, talking to them, and then turns around to talk smack. Weird.   When we left, Justin said he wasn't too impressed with the food. Looks like I was right again. Save your money and head out a little earlier to some place else."}
{"text":"We went here for my little brothers birthday last night and the food was pretty good i had the tofu stirfry wich was alright although the meatball sandwich my sister had was really small she said she had orderd it before and it was bigger maybe they are cutting portions,The biggest dissapointments for me were the waitress would not shut up She just kept talking and talking whenever she came by and i am trying to watch my calories so i got the stirfry thinking it was healthy lol!! and without the brown rice (that i ate) i later found out my stirfry was 1180 Calories!!! ahhh not a healthy place to eat when your watching your calories. about 40$ for four of us without drinks."}
{"text":"We ate on the patio on this gorgeous January afternoon and had Joe as our server. He is the best!  He had our two sandwiches split and shared on each other's plates. He has a great personality and a smile on his face. We will be back more often because the food is always delicious and now to request our new favorite server."}
{"text":"The waitresses are funny and will joke around with you but the food and drinks are only average and kind of pricey. This place is good to go during happy hour"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight and had the most amazing server. His name way Ryan M and he was amazing. The food was excellent as were the drinks. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. If you go in ask for ryan by name and you'll have a memorable experience."}
{"text":"In general, I tend to avoid patronizing chain restaurants and franchises when a suitable locally owned option exists.  But a friend of mine invited my girlfriend and I out to dinner along with his woman, and he had a some coupons for the Elephant Bar, so we decided to give it a shot.  First off, I really dug the atmosphere.  It felt like stepping into a Pier 1 Imports catalogue.  That whole tropical colonial vibe.  Not that I support colonialism.    This was a few months ago, so my memory is a bit spotty. I remember the service being good, and both of us enjoying our dishes.  After looking at their menu online, I determined that I had the vegetable stir fry with tofu.  Delicious.  Portions are large. Members of the non-lumberjack population that do not need to consume 5000 calories a day, would be just fine splitting a plate.  Unless you want the leftovers for lunch, then go ahead and get your own platter."}
{"text":"Mcgraths fish house used to be the worst resturant in this complex, but now that that's gone elephant bar is the winner of the worst. The pictures on the menu were like a dating site - easy to be mislead to expect something great to only be disappointed when delivered.   Terriayki chicken that my husband described as being killed, beaten, finely choped, fried beyond recognition, and them being merrinated in soy sauce for a week. The veggies he compared to the left overs found on the stove When the grill was cleaned.   The Asian in my Asian chicken salad must have been left in customs. No matter how many rice noodles are piled on the salad, it just can't be improved."}
{"text":"I went to Elephant bar last week for the first time. I was very surprised.. My meal was great just had a sandwich, the most impressing thing was our server Vince!! I am very picky and always ask for my stuff complicated and he was so polite and patient with me! I felt like I was in my own dining room eating. Very warm and professional. I will oh back for the food but more so for the great costumes service. Hopefully I can request to sit in Vince section!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to grab lunch after walking around the District (since its located there).  Quick tip: If the weather is nice, opt to eat outside.   Everything here is average price. You got your choices of salads, grilled foods, chicken, shrimp, and more. They are VERY accommodating to your needs. I had lunch here with a friend who is currently fasting and is on a vegan diet. Our waiter Brandon was very informative on a dish she wanted, but was worried if the dish contained any animal products. He came back and said it did contain some parts, but that the chef could substitute it with something else. How awesome!  Anyways, I had wood fire salmon with cilantro citrus sauce. It was AMAZING! The salmon was perfectly cooked and the vegetables along with sauce just tied everything together making this meal very enjoyable. I even treated myself to a guava cream shake which I see myself ordering again and I don't even like shakes that much.  Bottom line: worth your time."}
{"text":"Service was excellent by our waiter, but the food was horrendous, I won't be returning, I took the food to go and I will gladly feed the homeless!"}
{"text":"The reverse happy hour is amazing! I love the food there and the drinks are also fantastic! Can't wait to go back for more drinks!"}
{"text":"Visit 3-4 times a year.  Tonight food good service good.  Can't ask for much more.  Thanks"}
{"text":"Neat looking place with nice decorations, clean restaurant and friendly staff.  The food on the other hand not very impressive.  The Mongolian beef was over cooked, tuff and not very good.  Mashed potatoes were disgusting according to my daughter who loves all forms of potatoes. Philly cheese steak was greasy,  the bread fell apart,  and had little flavor.  Parmessian crusted chicken with pasta-the shrimp ate delicious,  the chicken had no flavor,  pays was good wroth Alfredo sauce.  The mammoth appetizer was descent as well as the chicken lettuce wrap.   All in all the place looks nice,  good service,  nice decorations,  but the food was not that good.  Perhaps for appetizers and drinks."}
{"text":"Yelp censored the below review of Elephant bar  \"Really horrible.....  Probably the worst food I have ever eaten.   Really nothing else to say\"  As it violated their content guidelines  So I will add to it.  The food at elephant bar was substandard to the point of being inedible.   I ate 2 bites of my Cajon chicken...and just stopped eating. My kid can make microwave chicken better then that.   The rice with andoulle sausage that was the side dish was actually worse. It had either sat out for days....because the rice was crispy despite not being fried, or was microwaved beyond recognition as rice.  This place should be ashamed of serving food like this"}
{"text":"Great! Went there on a very busy Friday and the food still came out delicious and on time. I had never been here before but I enjoyed the teriyaki chicken. This place is very similar to PF Changs but less expensive! Better value :)"}
{"text":"Danielle is the only reason I return to Elephant Bar. The food is pretty okay, 3 out of 5 in my opinion but, good customer service goes a long way. The booths are generally clean and the restaurant isn't too busy. Food comes out quickly and they're quick to accommodate anyone with allergies. It's also in a very convenient location which makes it a go to dinner spot. My only issue was with the server that I had the other night as he did not split the bill with my friend and me and charged me the full amount of the dinner. If my friend didn't have cash, I would have ended up paying for the whole meal. He also left and never returned after he did this so there was no way that I could get him to fix it."}
{"text":"Lest some readers of this review think that I've suddenly lost my touch or perspective, I can only say in my defense that I have seen the woefully low overall Yelp rating for this establishment and read many of the low-rated reviews, but must nevertheless ignore them and honestly report on my recent trip to the Elephant Bar.   I don't know whether I had an atypical dining experience, or if Elephant Bar staff took heed to recited complaints and improved their food and service, or if other reviewers just encountered a bad day there, but my overall experience was enjoyable, and all dishes I sampled were tasty.    I began with very good Macau Shrimp Noodle Soup, sporting mushrooms, green onions, white onions, bok choy, and fairly large shrimp in a lightly spicy broth.  It was an unusual and interesting Asian-flavored dish.    For my entree, I selected Chicken Marsala, which included a nicely grilled chicken breast, pappardelle noodles, and a mild traditional Marsala Sauce, accompanied by a good cooked tomato half and sauteed spinach.  It was a filling and satisfying display.  For dessert, what turned out to be a very big order of Strawberry Shortcake tasted good but I could have done without the thin Strawberry Sauce.  I also tried a friend's Creme Brulee, and it was very good.  Service was friendly and on the whole very efficient.  Food and drink orders were correctly fulfilled.  But entrees arrived a little early after appetizers and soup.  And, on the initial bill the server had forgotten to credit Senior Explorer card discounts.  This oversight was quickly corrected.    Judging by this one personal encounter with the Elephant Bar situated in Henderson, and several previous good dining outcomes I have experienced at Elephant Bar restaurants throughout Southern California, I expect to return here fairly soon for other fare, like the tantalizing Chicken Lettuce Wraps with glistening moist bits of chicken, diced water chestnuts, unblemished green shells of lettuce, and peanut sauce that one of my tablemates simply was not willing to share.  Boo!  Hiss!"}
{"text":"My friend and I hit up the happy hour on Friday night and had the pleasure of having Cortae being our bartender. He was very patient with us as we couldn't decide on our cocktails to start the night off (yes we were THOSE people. Lol) and then suggested a great selection for us!  The chicken pot stickers were to DIE for! Perfectly steamed then seared crisp on one side and beautifully presented.  Just a great night of tapas and drinks!"}
{"text":"Love happy hour with my girls ! Getting the drinks perfectly made and apps sampler was superb. Paired with our specialty drinks it was a perfect GNO!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the service was great. I recommend the Mongolian beef if you like spicy food. The portions are also large enough to share between 2."}
{"text":"I am new at this , but I really like this place a lot.  I love the flavor of their food , the wine selection albeit may be small selection, it is really nice complement to the foods they serve, although I only drink reds.  The last time here I ate at the bar and the server Denae was absolutely one of the best I have ever encountered.  I plan on going back in the near future before I return home."}
{"text":"I wanted to try out this restaurant while I was shopping at the district but I regret it now, I came in with my son and my husband , ordered some mojitos, water and juice for us , we literally waited 15 min or more to get our drinks, when we finally ordered the food, it took about 30 to get our food, I ordered a pot roast and my husband and son got a cheeseburger, they didn't like it my husband didn't even want to finish it , my pot roast tasted like a pile of shit. I'll never be back here for sure."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. The ceiling fans when you walk in are a nice touch. I wouldn't call this place Vietnamese though. They have a huge menu with all sorts of food, some of which are Asian fusion but there's also American and Italian. I had the Moroccan chicken which was good. My friend had the steak and lobster which he liked but I thought was meh. The steak wasn't anything special and the lobster was mushy but it was his food so whatever. I'd definitely like to go back because there was about 5 dishes I would have liked to try."}
{"text":"Great time with the hubby! Service was AWESOME!!!! Shawn was the best server we've ever had here! Good luck in Vegas Shawn, you are wonderful!!!!!Food was yummy too!"}
{"text":"excellent food!  several things are available but not on the menu so don't hesitate to ask for some combo or appetizer that interests you.   we ordered a big cookie (relish!) and it came out uncooked and not the correct cookie.  our waiter brandon tried several times to have the kitchen make us another but it never worked out.  he said next time we come in we could have a cookie on him.  great service.  definitely one of our favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"It's been about 2 years since my last visit. I gave up on this place after too many poor experiences. I was very happy that the place seems to have improved greatly! The Pub Burger at happy hour is one of the best deals anywhere- a big burger with bacon & a giant onion ring plus fries and a (domestic) draft beer for $7.95. Add $1 or $2 for an import or craft beer. Service was good, and the bartender (we ate at the bar) was friendly and even laughed at my jokes!  The happy hour menu doesn't have the rock bottom prices they used to have here. Drinks are discounted and some apps are half price. My old standby drink here, the Elephant Tea (a long island) was missing too which makes me sad. I would come back for the Pub Burger at happy hour for sure."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner at Elephant Bar last night!   Got a coupon in the mail for 2 meals and an appetizer for $20! While they did limit the  selections you could get with the coupon, we were happy with the choices so it worked out fine.  Food was delicious and the service was fantastic! Waitress was very attentive and polite.  Location was a plus too! Had a lovely walk around The District shops afterward.   All and all, a hands down 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Always a great time.. happy hour menu to die for with excellent quality and value.. drink menu is flavorful and inventive.. the bar tenders and servers are always attentive and classy.. we make it a point to visit every time were in the area.. the only thing I would change would be the noise level and wait occasionally..."}
{"text":"You can come here for happy hour drinks but do not under any circumstances eat dinner here."}
{"text":"We were at the District Sunday evening and decided to try Elephant Bar for dinner. I was surprised how empty it was on a Sunday evening, but after our dinner I realized why.   Obviously we were seated as soon as we walked in and almost all the tables were empty. Our server was nice and provided pretty good service with a few exceptions. We started with the calamari and ordered the California cobb salad and the misoyaki salmon. I usually stay away from farm raised fish as there is a big difference in taste but I was assured it was good.   The calamari was brought out and it was terrible. Very greasy and fishy tasting with a thick coat of batter. The Cobb wasn't bad, but just your typical salad. The salmon was presented nicely and I liked the thin vegetables it was served with. The fish itself I didn't like, it just didn't taste fresh like salmon should. The misoyaki sauce was pretty good but didn't help the flavor enough.   For dessert we ordered the butter cake and cheesecake. By now a few more people came in that were seated around us. We saw our desserts sitting on the counter in the kitchen for quite a while. We didn't see our server, or anyone for that matter. It was all I could do to not walk over and just get them myself. Finally the hostess walked over and brought them to us. The first couple bites of butter cake were good, but then it got cold and hard, like they didn't heat it all the way through. The cheesecake was better.   I visit the district often, but don't see myself returning here."}
{"text":"I haven't been in a while.  To be honest haven't been a big fan up until now.  We went there for brunch - who knew they served brunch!?!  It was empty when they opened at 10am.  I had stacked tostadas with refried beans, bacon, eggs, cheesy sauce.  It was delicious!  The bloody mary wasn't bad either!  May have to try again for dinner one night."}
{"text":"Love it. Great variety of food and everything on the menu tastes good! They have delicious tropical drinks. Awesome service. Great coupon club, too!  Maybe the decor is cheesy, but that's part of the fun!"}
{"text":"I love the location of this place and it has super convenient  parking and access to the District and GVR.  The place can get pretty busy and the wait times can be long. The menu is decent and pricing is fair but the last couple of times I've been in the service has been lack luster.   Nothing phenomenal about the place food is decent service could be better!"}
{"text":"First, there is not a single dish containing elephant on the menu...so I don't know why its called elephant bar if they don't serve it.  The wife had chicken marsala, which while not bad tasted more like chicken in a brown gravy with mushrooms than chicken marsala.  I had a steak and shrimp dinner.   Steak was good.  Shrimp were fair.  The shrimp were served with an asian chilli sauce that, again, while not bad tasted pretty much like a generic chilli sauce that you can buy at any asian market.  Veggies served with both meals were pretty good.  Ordered the apple blueberry cobbler for dessert.  Not bad but a bit sweet.  Service was good.  Restaurant is LOUD...almost to the point of unpleasantness."}
{"text":"Always go there with my bf for a happy hour. The food is amazing, the service is very quick and the prices are very good. Try chicken wrap and fried calamari."}
{"text":"I went in here for a midday drinky drink! I had their bloody mary.  I would have to give it 4 stars.  Tasty, tangy and not to salty. Just the way I like it.  Atmosphere was calm for a Sunday.  The food looked fabulous and the server recommended the coconut shrimp.  I shall try this next time my friends :)"}
{"text":"Once upon a time there was a privately owned local restaurant called the Elephant Bar at Christown Mall. It was a 6 star, superb restaurant and closed maybe in the 90's. This is not that same one. Very Corporate Disneyfied jungle themed restaurant now. I am guessing since it is a chain it is not related to the original. When they sprung up a few years ago I wondered what happened to the old one and if there is any connection to these newer ones. The woman in the restaurant today could not tell me.   With that said, Wow, the reviews on here really surprised me. I ate lunch here today and have eaten at the Chandler location twice before. Today's lunch was great. Our server was a Gem (Brian maybe?) and the food was fine. I never pretend that eating out is all that healthy anyway so I assume it is not when I go out. I am not sure why a lot of Yelpers noted how bad it was for you since it did not seem any worse then any other Chain fusion chain restaurant I have ever eaten at.   I ate the Macadamia Nut chicken lunch special. It was good. Not great, but not terrible either. Instead of my three stars for good, I am giving it four stars because the service was spectacular, the company divine, and the restaurant is beautiful. Okay, maybe a tad cheesy, but I like the entire safari themed furniture and decor."}
{"text":"It was 6:30pm and we had not eaten dinner yet. There was a discussion on just where we were going to eat. No decision was made so I just started to drive. I headed to restaurant row near 83 ave. and Bell road. Saw The Elephant Bar and decided to give it a try. I had eaten there but more than a year ago for lunch. We had to wait about  ten minutes for a table not bad since we came in at what would of been a busy time. We were seated and had to wait for several minutes before our waitress arrived. Longer than I had expected. Our drink order was taken and our food order was taken when they returned with our drinks. I ordered the Quick Seared Ahi Tuna salad, my wife ordered a side salad and the Mac and Cheese. She is on a low protein diet.  Silverware was delivered to our table. My knife was very dirty. They took the knife and brought me a clean one. Really looked like they just wiped it off and returned it.  I had asked the Ahi to be as rare they could do it. Raw was preferable. My wife's food came but not my food. Five to ten minuets later the waitress noticed I had no food and came over apologizing saying it was on it's way and would be ready in five minuets.  When my salad came the ahi was very done. So done the meat was starting to flake not quite white yet but getting there. I talked to the waitress when it was delivered about the condition of the ahi. She did apologize and volunteered to take it back. My wife was almost done with her meal by this time so I just asked her to leave it.  The manager came over and apologized for the over cooked ahi and offered to bring me another piece. I really did not want to wait and said I was OK. He left and came back in a few minutes and said he was going to send me a new piece of ahi. It was delivered in about ten minutes and was prepared the way it was supposed to be.  Somewhere above our drinks went dry. We was never offered a refill.  I would of given them 1 star except the manager really did try to make things better. The salad was very tasty. The ahi was just over cooked after I had asked for it to just be seared.  They got a low score because the food was not delivered to both people at the same time, the silverware was dirty, no refill on the drinks, food over cooked. Will I go back?? Probably but maybe just for lunch to get a sandwich."}
{"text":"Service is excellent and the restaurant is clean. Waitress and manager were very attentive. The appetizer is average. We ordered Lettuce wraps and it was plain. We also ordered steak for dinner and it was a bit over cooked. Meat was tough and probably will not ordered it again. Their drinks, however, is absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"New menu now. All side items ala cart. Very expensive for what you get. Doubt we will ever be back. The day we went for lunch at noon time the place was dead. Service was below standards. Prediction is this unit will close at this rate. Wound up ordering soup and salad. Salad was about the worst dinner salad ever."}
{"text":"I was seriously surprised when I walked into this place!  The decor is over the top!  The menu was, sadly, pretty blan though.  There wasn't much to get excited about.  My salmon meal kind of sucked.  I wouldn't go back unless I felt the need to be surrounded by animal print."}
