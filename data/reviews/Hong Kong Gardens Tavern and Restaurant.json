{"text":"This was unreservedly the very worst Chinese food that I have ever ordered.  I ordered Shrimp Chow Mein at 5:00 pm and it arrived luke warm, with pale and overcooked vegetables (green pepper and onion) in a thick sauce like glue, and overly salty.  The shrimp were unappealing.  Instead of crispy chow mien, it was in soup sauce, soft and just mush.  I very politely asked if I might have it re-heated, and nicely asked about the texture of the chow mein noodles.  The woman was not very pleased.  Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Really great value, great old-school Chinese food that, like someone else wrote previously, will remind you of the take-aways of your youth.  Really happy with it and the price was fair as well.  We had take-away as I mentioned, but the restaurant itself looked quite nice too.  
Without a doubt I've found my new go-to for Chinese goodness!"}
{"text":"Would never get this Chinese food again. Got seafood chow main and pork fried rice. Absolutely no flavor. Go across the street and get green mango. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A legend in the KINGSWAY. Family run for years. They provide excellent chinese food in a fun and casual dining room. The decor is a trip back in time. Superb wonton soup and stellar fried rice."}
{"text":"The chicken balls were actually quite good however our 10 year old ended up with brutal, painful food poisoning. As that was the only thing she'd eaten there was no question where it came from. Something was badly mishandled and contaminated. 

I desperately wanted to like this place as it's local, but food poisoning aside the rest of the dishes were below average at best and the hot and sour soup was borderline disgusting.  Even average Chinese takeout would have been acceptable, but based on our experience I have a hard time believing a single 5* review."}
{"text":"Since this has been here for years, we thought why not?  Busy delivery service, too.  But OMG - worst Chinese food ever.  Husband has lived in China and we both eat downtown Chinese food, so we are not neophytes.

Food was so bad, we only took a few bites - we had ordered 4 dishes thinking we could keep the rest for other meals.  But we didn't take anything home - worst Chinese food ever."}
{"text":"Great Chinese-Canadian food. Vegetables were fresh and not over cooked. Chicken as tasty. Had the Broccoli and Beef, HK Special Rick, Phoenix Next and of course Chicken Balls. My kids and I had a great meal.
If you are looking for a good filling meal that reminds you of the Chineses food from your childhood, this is your place."}
{"text":"Got some late evening take out since everything else in the area was closed.  

Wonton soup and general chicken were decent.  

It's pretty tough to mess up rice but this one was fried and re-fried many times over (probably because it was left over at the end of the day).  

Salt and pepper shrimp were inedible - not de-shelled, too much msg/salt (shouldn't have ordered it since its usually a hit or miss dish, especially from a place you're not familiar with)

You probably need to know what to order from the menu.  They've been in business for a long time, so they must be doing something right.  However, this customer got unlucky..."}
{"text":"Excellent phone reception and all around customer service!! and Good Food woo hoo!

Helped move a friend into a new apartment yesterday and she rewarded us with free chinese food. As a Yelp elite cough God cough I was the chosen one to find a delivery place and I was so lucky to find Hong Kong Gardens. Yelp put them at a decent 3.5 rating with a 3.8 rating on google and 4.1 on a similar delivery/review site. Phoned them up at 10:45pm and they were still open and what's more, the female receptionist was super helpful in helping us place our order since we didn't have menus and she was extremely accommodating, e.g. offering to modify our combo meal, adding plenty of paper plates & cutlery since all the kitchen supplies were still packed in boxes. She told us the delivery would probably take less than 45 minutes and I was skeptical but nope - our order showed up within 20 - 25 minutes! Delivery guy was really friendly and welcoming and I'm happy they appreciated gaining a few new customers...they even threw in a complimentary bag of Chinese dry noodle snacks which were still warm on arrival. 

Our order:
-Combo for 2: Egg rolls (crispy goodness), Chicken chow mein (probably the freshest and biggest pieces of chicken I have tasted from a Chinese delivery joint in a long while), chicken balls & sauce (real chicken inside - we all agreed they were great), chicken fried rice (it was ok, the original combo comes with pork fried rice). A few packets of cutlery+pepper+salt, plum sauce, hot sauce & soy sauce :)
-4 cans of pop 
-Crispy ginger beef (a unique dry spice batter on the beef...different from the excess of ginger beef sauce that I'm used to. It was ok - definitely better than the one at East Moon's in North York. But I suspect it won't be easy to find a good crispy ginger beef in this city...not like how it's done in the National Capital Region anyway).
-Fortune cookies
GRAND TOTAL: $41.50 

BONUS: No delivery charge!!

SUPER BONUS: The receptionist called back to make sure all the food arrived on time and that we were satisfied with our order and of course we were :)  That was a nice touch and we were all impressed with the quality of their service. Highly recommend this place!
