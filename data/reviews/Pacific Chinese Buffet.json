{"text":"The worst place ever, the place is scary the food in not fresh at all, terrible experience I have ever had don't waste your money and time."}
{"text":"This was a horrible dining experience.  All the food that was supposed to be crispy was rubbery and gross.  If it was supposed to be hot it was cold, if it was supposed to be cold it was warm.  Entire family is sipping ginger ale and hoping to not vomit tonight.  Complained to the management about the quality of the food and she offered us coupons for a return visit.  Sure we will come back, we love trying to get food poisoning.  Nothing better than a little ecoli."}
{"text":"Astoundingly, Astonishingly ... Average.

Although I have nothing bad to say about Pacific Buffet, I can't say anything that makes it really that great either.  It is the 2012 replacement of the now-defunct Long-Yun's Mongolian Buffet Restaurant.  I am very hard-pressed to explain how impossibly average you will find Pacific Buffet.  If you were to rate all 100,000 Chinese buffets in the United States, and then calculate the precise average of them, you would end up here.  

They have all of your tired old favorites: Lo mein, sweet & sour chicken, crab rangoon, etc.  Another table has the fruit and salad choices, which like any buffet is a roll of the dice for potential bacteria d'jour.  There is a guy working the teppanyaki grill (this is a flat surface grill which has an ancient custom for your requests to go misunderstood and to take far longer to cook than you anticipated).

They do have sushi, and though it is limited to a few maki rolls and a few individual pieces, I would recommend the sushi area as the place to fill up.  Will you find any of it outstanding?  No.  Will you find any of it inedible?  You shouldn't.  Like a science experiment in finding the statistical average, you will find yourself incredulous at how precisely mundane everything it is.

Okay, one thing fun that set it apart - on our way out of the restaurant, my kids pet the horses.  They are the concrete horses that Long-Yun's left behind when they had to skip town.  As my co-worker Tim pointed out to me, the horses are like a shrunken version of the giant horse statues at P.F. Chang's restaurant.  They were downsized to a version that is much more... you guessed it... average."}
{"text":"Food so so, price is expensive consider the quality of the food. $12/adult is expensive when the resultant deliberately ignore the empty crab leg plate and left it sets there during the whole corse when we were there about an hour. Will not recommend, will not come back!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly but its getting worst when it comes to how much food is available terrible and how fresh it is i ordered a water and the water had a faint taste of fruit punch mixed which means they do not clean very well I've also been told on two occasions that more food would be made but the results were only one pan of food was brought out I really dislike this place now I will not be returning don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant, but walked out feeling a little disappointed.  I found the food and atmosphere to be only mediocre. The food did not seem fresh and the round, outdated building made me feel like I was in a seedy truckstop in 1974.  Staff were friendly.  One huge bonus is the all you can eat crab legs, but you are limited to 6 per trip and they are on the small side.  I would eat here again if I had to, but wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"The worst food, i have ever had, very unfriendly staff and they overcharged my card and i had to tell them to fix it never going there again"}
{"text":"Very Friendly staff... no extra charge for seafood... steak not worth the wait.

We were there on a snowy winter night... only 3 other parties in the place... the staff made sure that any item that was not on the buffet that we wanted was refreshed.

I love bean paste sesame balls... they brought out 6 at a time...and finally came around and ask if my husband and I wanted another round.

I decided to try the steak... which was included... but was only a quarter inch thick and tasteless.... this used to be The Mark Steakhouse back in the 70's... they may beat the last buffet in buffet quality... but the steak is sure forgettable. 

Another party seemed to be regulars and tried some of the sushi rolls and enjoyed them all... and the staff made up some special ones that the party hadn't had before.

The other reviews are right... it is average... on the positive... the steam trays fit properly so there isn't a rain forest under the sneeze hood... so the crispy foods are really crispy!

Dinner for 2 with soda and tax - $28"}
{"text":"I saw the dirty dining story on 19 Action News for the former Long-Yuns that was open in this spot a couple of years ago, so I was very skeptical when I saw this place open. We gave it a couple of months and see that they have consistent traffic during lunch time. So we gave it a try and I have to say we will definitely go back. The food was great and plentiful. For $6.95 at lunchtime, you get 4 islands of food to chose from. Granted, this food is not on the PF Changs level, but neither is the price. Dinner buffet was only $11.95, and you can order steak and they will cook it for you. The place is very clean, wait staff is very attentive, and hours later, I still feel fine."}
{"text":"The only food that was good was the stuff they didn't make--french fries, watermelon, and cantalope. Every type of Chinese food I tried had the same odd flavor. Can't think of anything that would make me return."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place! Great location, friendly service and delicious foods! Must get the crab legs! The place looked very clean and smelled yummy! We will be back again and again! We recommend for sure."}
{"text":"Formerly Long Yun's, it used to be a lot better than it is now although it started to go downhill before the closing and re-opening under its new name. The service is friendly and I would even give the food 4 stars except that they don't put out enough of it and they wait too long to refill the trays. We used to eat here once or twice a month, now it's once or twice a year."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is deteriorating very rapidly. The place was almost empty. The food looks like left overs from lunch. I don't see this surviving for long"}
{"text":"This place is just ok.  Not terrible nor magnificent.  They have have a good selection of food but they seem to ration it.  The food was good but the presentation was a little poor.  I would come again and the price was great!  $6.95 for Saturday lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"This place is beautiful! Apparently the previous restaurant that was here was yucky, but these are new owners and it's totally remodeled. Now it's a Chinese buffet. The price is great and it's super light & airy & pretty inside. We booked the private room for an anniversary party. They let us come decorate it in advance and it's huge! We had it set for 40 and it wasn't crowded!  The bathrooms are super clean too. There are tons of food choices, even some \"American\" food.  There is also Mongolian BBQ style where you pick out what you want them to grill and they grill it.  I'm not normally a fan of buffet food, but it's convenient for lunch break and this one is pretty great."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place stays open. Below avg for and quality and quantity is sad.  This is a Chinese buffet and they basically ration the food they put out.   Over priced for what you get and at one time the org Long Yun's was clean and food hot and fresh.  Would not recommend this place at all."}
