{"text":"This is a great place to celebrate a special occasion or treat yourself. The filet mignon with the Yukon mash was fantastic, and the service was phenomenal. My steak was a little on the rare side for my liking, but they put it back on for a few minutes and threw in a free desert for the trouble. Top notch food and service!"}
{"text":"Small crowd night. Good service. Salad and both entrees nicely done. Wife had the filet and I had chicken. I ordered the chocolate cake for dessert and the ice cream was ice crystals. They could of had 5 stars but for the ice cream."}
{"text":"This is a small intimate restaurant where the chef cooks in front of the guests which is pretty cool.
 very mellow atmosphere , more of an older crowd.  ordered the fillet mignon with the Yukon mashed potatoes and hubby ordered the lamb chops , both were exceptionally delicious. Got the cheese plate and it was yummers! Great w/ my merlot chateau st. Jean and red sangria.
Cons: didn't like the bowl like plate that made me scoop out my meat and didn't hold my steak knife. Crackers in cheese plate would've rather had a heartier kind than these water ones.
Also  service is very slooow! 
Which is why I gave it 4 stars

Total $110.
Dress; anywhere from dresses to jeans with nice blouses
For men: slacks to the Tommy Bahamas poster boy look."}
{"text":"came here for easter brunch with the family. the food was fantastic. the dessert table was great. our waitress didn't come by often. ordered a juice and it came in such a small glass and she only refilled it once... it was so small.  I didn't like that there were only 4 for brunch and when the bill came they already had the tip included at 20%. for what? we got up to get our own food, the waitress really only brought out juice, the back kitchen guys are the one to refill the water. I hope next time it'll be better. the 4 stars are for the food and yummy dessert!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service.  My husband and I had the filet mignon and Gouda Mac n cheese.  Steak was cooked perfectly and the Mac n cheese was awesome!  Service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. The foie gras, buffalo, ribeye, desserts, caesar salad, drinks, are the best in the Valley at any price at any location. Thank you."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Litchfields to celebrate our belated anniversary.  We just moved to Arizona and have already had a variable amount of dining experiences. Therefore, we went  without any expectations.  Our senses and tastebuds were blown away!  From the minute we parked, the scenery was beautiful and the hostess was friendly.  The decor inside the restaurant was warm and inviting, yet still elegant.  Our server was helpful, gracious, and wanting to please.  My husband, an avid steak eater, was thrilled with his filet, but loved his wedge salad and in-love with the asparagus. I will admit, the wood-baked bread took his gold medal.  So much, in fact, he brought some home for the kids.  I, a vegan, was not expecting much.  I asked for a simple salad and was awed with this array of fresh veggies and delicious asparagus. Dressing wasn't even needed or used.   We also enjoyed a variety of wines and, although we didn't indulge, the cocktails and desserts looked amazing.   The manager walked around chatting with diners and helping in anyway asked and the help-staff left us wanting for nothing."}
{"text":"In beautiful Arizona on business. Staying at the Wigwam Resort. Had dinner with 8 guys at Litchfield's. The decor is southwestern and very cozy. A open wood burning stove is blazing for all of the guest to see. Litchfield's has a great selection of wine and competitively priced with other restaurants nationwide. Service was outstanding two servers handled all eight of us with ease. I had the trout, it was fresh and very very good. ( try a side of risotto with your meal, outstanding). A majority of the table ordered the pork chops. It was huge and most of them could not finish it. They all raved about it and all of us being from Chicago we know about chops. (Stockyards and Bulls) Pricing was fair for the service and meal. The grounds around the restaurant are  amazing. Have an after dinner drink by fire pit outside. All in all, a must try."}
{"text":"We hit Litchfield's up recently for a Saturday night dinner - it was wonderful!  Hubs enjoyed the Ribeye and smoked gouda mac and cheese - I had the vegetarian tamale.  My husband enjoyed his steak and my entree was average.  Portion sizes were pretty small, so thankful we ordered salad and appetizers as well.  Salad was the house salad - divine with berries and balsamic vinegar.  Creme brulee at the end was absolutely PERFECT.  Great piano player who took requests (Moon River). 

Prickly Pear Margarita was awesome.  Cocktails are tiny! 

The only reason we are going 4 stars with the review is because of price.  It was a good meal, and a nice ambiance, but is overpriced by about 20%."}
{"text":"I appreciate the use of local ingredients, but use them right. Chicken was dry. Gouda mac n' cheese tasted like feet, and I like gouda. Service was awful. We had to flag down sometime who was wiping down clean tables to get a refill on water and another guy just walking around to get our check. The meal took over two hours and we didn't order dessert. The appetizer, frito mixto, almost ruined my appetite entirely. The sauce was a pico de gallo mayo (which tasted like old el paso salsa mixed with miracle whip) and the calamari/shrimp/bay scallop mix was something from Long John Silver's. I too got sick after eating here. Even with a 50% off discount this place is worth avoiding at all costs. The hotel is terrible too - just reaffirms why I stay in Phoenix if I want good service and food."}
{"text":"Very nice setting, great tasting food. We ate here while staying at the resort. It's upscale so expensive but not outrageous. The food was very well prepared and I love that all of the ingredients are from local farms."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant. Had the ahi appetizer which was fantastic. Rack of lamb was perfectly cooked medium rare. Wish they would open 7 days a week. Service is great with really knowledgeable staff and since everything is cooked to order, I was able to request certain items be left off my meal. Great place for a special occasion celebration"}
{"text":"We (myself, boyfriend and daughter) had a great Christmas Eve dinner here. It is our third time. Our dinner was reserved at 830pm. They seated us right away even though the restaurant looked busy. The food was delicious! We ordered the duck, seabass, and filet dishes. Also had the Caesar which was exceptional. Service was impeccable that night. Such a great dining experience. The prices are a little pricey but it's worth it. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Walked out of The Vic for their atrocious service.. went on to Verrado Grill to be turned away...Landed at Litchfield's to enjoy a fabulous dinner, tasty drinks and never felt hurried at all. Waitress was witty and attentive. We were last table in restaurant yet no one made us feel the need to rush. Great ambiance and relaxing feel.. live music outside... Had a fantastic time... highly recommend.."}
{"text":"The food was hit-n-miss but on the whole good. The service was nice but she seemed distracted most of the time. The noise and lack of privacy were unacceptable.

The prosciutto with dates appetizer was good but there was nothing to it. It was exactly just the ingredients, a little bit of prosciutto and 3 dates. There's no reason to order it again and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone because you could easily make it at home.

The warm beet salad was excellent. The farmers salad however did not fit the meal or the season. It was light and citrusy, it would be excellent for a warm summer evening, or light spring lunch at a cafe, not a cold February evening at a steakhouse

The lamb was good, just good. The filet was excellent but did not need the sauce added. It was very tender for grass-fed beef.  The beef was served with some melt in your mouth baby potatoes that were excellent.  We ordered mushrooms as a side and they were not good.  This was especially noticable because the mushrooms at Red's (Litchfield's predecessor) were simply amazing. 

The creme brule and creme with berries deserts were just ok.  The creme brule was over powered by the marmalade on it.  The creme with berries had some sort of cake or bread at the bottom that was supposed to be soaked in grand marnier but only half of it was, the other half was hard and not good.

We did not enjoy the proximity of other tables and the amount of noise from all the close tables packed into the dining room.  Adding to the din was the kitchen, located in the dining room with all the banging and clattering, it was hard to enjoy a quiet conversation.  

It's the best we'll find in the SW valley but no one should drive out just for this restaurant.  In the end the quality of the main courses and the salads saved the restaurant. so A-Ok."}
{"text":"Never again!  If I wanted my steak burned to a bitter charcoal crisp I'd do it on my own grill and leave it overnight and save $$$.  I've been lured back here because of the beautiful grounds of the Wig Wam, but never again"}
{"text":"We went to Litchfield's for our anniversary. We loved the ambiance of the restaurant. The staff was friendly and our server was not just knowledgeable but kind and gave us his opinions on certain foods we had questions about. My started with the spinach appetizer- very good. My husband ordered the salmon- he mentioned it was a tad bit too salty. I ordered the scallops and I also thought the same. Although both were still very tasty. We shared the mashed potatoes which were superb. Overall I gave the restaurant four stars. We would definitely come back. One thing I thought would have been nice was for the hostess to ask if we were celebrating anything. In situations like this some restaurants would maybe provide a small dessert and write \"happy anniversary\" on the plate. Maybe in the future."}
{"text":"Amazing Farm to table setting.  In the summer they have groupon that make it more affordable!"}
{"text":"The food was great, but the manager, Tim, handled a situation with string, offensive words and manners.  It made the whole experience awkward."}
{"text":"We used a groupon to go here for dinner Saturday night. When I made the reservation, they asked if it was a special occasion. It was and our server told us happy anniversary as she greeted us and then brought us a dessert at the end of the meal. They have a great wine selection. My husband had the filet mignon and it was flawless!! I had the salmon and it was also very good. The ambience was great and I loved watching the chefs plate food at the open kitchen."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places out of all of Maricopa County and for sure the best restaurant in Litchfield Park. Scottish salmon is amazing. The chef always comes up with amazing food. Great wines. Beautiful spot in the incredible Wigwam Resort."}
{"text":"From the menu, the dishes appeared as if they should be creative and tasty.  That said, the pork chop, which was promised to be \"medium\" was served well done and dry.  What a shame as it \"looked\" very good.  The chopped steak was definately not just ground beef and was very tasty and tender, however the sweet potato spaetzle was a mushy disappointment.  The lamb stew was the best of our table.  It could have used a few more veggies than just a carrot and some potatoes, but was good in flavor and tenderness.  For dessert we had zabaione which proved to be on the runny side instead of a light custard.  Having been an Italian chef, this was a little disappointing, however the flavor was ok and the berries were outstanding.  

The noise level of the restaurant reminded me more of a Denny's than a 4 star restaurant.  It was very distracting.  If we are to return, we will just eat in the restaurant lounge - which was very quiet.  Or maybe just go down the street to the other Wigwam restaurant, the Grill (Red Allens).

Service is not lacking.  Everyone bends over backwards to be attentive, professional and not overbearing.  Our server was a sweet young lady.  The location is fabulous and we enjoyed our after dinner tour with Lance, the very informative and entertaining on-site Hopi storyteller.

Ultimately, no matter who the chef is who developed the menu and concept - the food is only as good as the staff cooking it.  This place is just screaming for a high level chef like Robert McGrath or Eddie Matney.  Perhaps I was just expecting better."}
{"text":"I was REALLY pumped up to go to this restaraunt.  I had wanted to go for a long time...the west side isn't known for fancy so I was excited to go to what may be higher end food than we usually get.  I wasn't dissapointed but it wasn't the best I'd had.  The appetizer was good, all sorts of little fried wonders!  Also, they brought out some warm yummy bread.  My first drink was amazing...Saguro Margarita...to die for!  Do it!  I got the fish special for dinner and it was a little dry for my taste.  The rest of my group however got the lamb and loved it.  I will go again and hopefully then can report a higher rating."}
{"text":"I give it 3 stars for the ambiance.  Service was actually quite good.  Food? B.O.R.I.N.G.  I ordered the Cesar salad and added chicken.  Chicken dry. Salad ok.  Dressing was good.  Boys ordered a pasta dish that was tasteless.  the pasta was fresh and al dente but the sauce was less than exciting.  All in all for a 5 star resort I expected much more."}
{"text":"It hurts me to write this, but we had an absolutely bad experience. We come here every year when they do their groupon summer special. This year was probably our last. 

My favorite part of dinner was the bread. We started with the pork belly appetizer. It was tasty, but the jalapeño honey tasted like it was only drizzled on one side. 

Then we waited and waited and waited. I could see the 2 chefs working their tails off. The manager never came around to our table. We just sat wondering if we would finish our wine before dinner came out. Dinner finally arrived, but they didn't bring us any steak knives, so I tried to get someone's attention. I couldn't flag anyone down, so we had to wait longer for our server to come over.

Our steak was tougher than it should be and unevenly cooked. It was over-seared on one side. It seemed like lesser quality meat than previous trips. The scallops were ok, but nothing to write home about.

Service was terrible. Our server was standoffish and inattentive. Even the extra service staff was lackluster compared to previous visits.

Litchfield's was never our favorite, but a solid place with high quality ingredients. Sadly, this doesn't seem to be true anymore. 

We cooked steak at home that was much better the next day and it was so much better!"}
{"text":"Have lived here 7 years, moving back East in a month and just discovered Litchfield's (bar side). Friendly ladies behind the bar, nice drinks and delicious dinner right at the bar. The sweet corn soup is our favorite, along with the brown rice risotto -so savory with sweet potato and sweet corn and the steaks are delish. But the best part is Jay Soto - wonderful piano and smooth jazz artist plays Fri/Sat nites. Where can you find such world class delicious live smooth sounds but in Litchfield Park? How amazing and sorry we didn't discover this fact sooner. We've had two very enjoyable Friday evenings in a row here and will always remember this hidden gem and the fact we got to see a great artist in such a cozy venue."}
{"text":"Setting off to San Diego on a Thursday evening, my girlfriend and I decided to eat here before setting out for Yuma.  It wasn't busy, the ambiance was relaxed and the overall atmosphere was very comfortable.

The wine list is a little overpriced but, on the whole, we ended up with a $30 Zinfandel that we paid $70 for - a good wine but not really worth that price!

We decided to split the beet salad, a good choice as it would more salad than either of us would have eaten alone.  It was fresh, the greens, beets, walnuts and cheese all blended well with the dressing.  She ordered the trout and I ordered the cavatelli.  Both were nicely presented and well balanced plates.  She ended up liking the cavatelli more than the trout, so I ended up eating more of that which was okay with me as I thought it was excellent.

The staff was attentive and polite, the food was better than average and the overall experience was very pleasant. I only wish they could brew a decent cup of coffee..."}
{"text":"Food took over 70 minutes to come out-we just about left. Beet salad, carrot soup and spaghetti were delicious. Seafood was meh at best. Ambiance was beautiful! However, nobody checked on us after we got the food, the server yelled at her bussers and tried to blame it on them. Then she hovered when it was tip time. Manager came out but didn't attempt to \"fix\" our experience. Hostesses were very nice and accommodating. After all the hype I expected a better experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I came for our anniversary on a Saturday night. We had a reservation and the table was ready when we arrived, the waitress was both very friendly and attentive.  We started with a bottle of local Arizona wine, reasonably priced for a restaurant, and each had the roasted beet salad. Excellent. We each had steak and both were perfectly done. For side dishes we had two, the trumpet mushrooms which were a bit tough, and the broccoli, which was fine. The farm to table concept is a welcome one, and the service was excellent throughout. 

We would recommend this place for a nice night out, our check with wine and gratuity was right at $200. Overall very enjoyable and good service."}
{"text":"In A Nutshell:

-I celebrated my 40th birthday at Litchfield's located inside Wigwam.
-I couldn't have asked for a better place.
-Real quick history lesson.
-Wigwam, sits on 16,000 acres of land that was formerly used to grow cotton.
-The cotton was used in Goodyear Tires, which is why the company bought the land.
-Eventually the well-off executives families, decided to make Wigwam a resort due to the nice weather and facilities.
-Litchfield's in recent years was renamed and reorganized.
-Today, it has a fantastic rustic feel w/ warm wooden ambiance.
-The service is first-class.
-The open kitchen uses a pecan wood-fired oven to cook all the protein.
-Each season a new menu is offered, so 4 different menus year round.
-Everything is farm-to-table and if it's not farmed locally, then it's shipped in fresh.

Overall, I recommend grabbing a meal here.  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"On 11/12/2017 you wrote
Very nice, it was a date night for my wife and I. And we couldn't have went to a better place. Deion was our server and he did a great job. We sat in the patio area and the weather was perfect for it. We started with a nice bottle of cabernet and the black mussels, which were nice and meaty with chorizo bits. So good then I had the ribeye with blue cheese crumbles on top along with cheesy grits. The steak and grits was perfect. My wife had the filet mignon and green beans also cooked perfect, green beans had pieces of bacon in them really tasty. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went to Litchfield's for Christmas Eve dinner. Food was overpriced and service was bad. Dessert table looked like the frozen selection at Costco. Automatic 20 percent gratuity was added in to check automatically.. service didn't warrant a 20 percent gratuity. When you have to request water 3-4 times and the busboy made off with our bread and butter. We asked for it back and he said he would bring a fresh batch. Two requests later the bread arrived  with our meal.."}
{"text":"Another West Valley disappointment
. I figured this was a high end resort nope. Steak tasted like dirty grill order a glass of Silver Oak that tasted old. Service just was not there... pass on this one..."}
{"text":"We have dined here before and usually have had a good experience.  Tonight was a major disappointment. Service was good but food was mediocre at best. For appetizers, we ordered ahi tuna, gnocchi, and the cold pea soup.  The tuna was tender but only had a tiny drizzle of sauce which you couldn't even taste, rendering the fish very bland.  It was served over thin cucumber slices which certainly didn't kick up the flavor.  The gnocchi was pretty good but a bit too salty.  It was served with an egg yolk and chunks of fatty bacon or pork belly or something.  The chilled pea soup was awful.  Served with a few streams of creme fraiche, a touch of mint, and a few wafer thin slices of a chili pepper, it literally tasted like eating grass with a terrible after taste.  Not sure what they were thinking on that one??  
We split the salmon entree served with halved heirloom grape tomatoes and cornbread croutons.  Again, almost no sauce, the fish was slightly over cooked and a little dry but tasted good with accompaniments. Oddly enough, the star of the show was the asparagus. It was cooked perfectly, salted well, and had a great overall roasted flavor.
For dessert we did the Apple crisp which had a gingersnap crumble with vanilla ice cream. It was good and a good portion, but nothing to write home about. I want to like this restaurant because it is the nicest in the area, but at their premium price points, they need to taste the food that they are serving and address some obvious flaws."}
{"text":"Second time here. Food was lukewarm. Server knew we were celebrating our anniversary but never asknoweded or offered any type of help celebrating.  I love the Wigwam but this will be the last time this restaurant will be part of my agenda."}
{"text":"Had the Caesar salad. It was different in that there were whole pieces of anchovy mixed in the dressing. For my entree, I tried the ribeye and smoked Gouda Mac and cheese. The steak didn't have much flavor and was a little tough, however, the Mac and cheese was delicious and cheesy! Very pricey restaurant."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here a couple times. Great place. Had lunch here today. Food came out a little cool. My daughter's burger was OK. I had the street taco trio, one each of chicken, carnitas, and beef. Blandest tacos ever. Only the carnitas had some flavor, and barely. The beef was not marinated and lacked even salt and pepper. Chicken was dry and unseasoned. Tasteless. 

Service was good though. 

We'll be back. But not for the street tacos."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on a weekend evening, so it was not surprising that there was a wait for a regular dining room table. We were asked if we wanted to sit in the bar where there was no wait and still have the full menu available, and we decided to go with that. My only grouse with the bar area is it was very dimly lit so that we needed the light of our mobile devices to read the menu. Other than that, everything was excellent: the decor, the service, the quality of the food (the pork belly nachos we had as appetizer was by itself already worth the drive to the Wigwam), and the music provided by a wonderful pianist."}
{"text":"Food was great!  Service was \"standard\".  Had to ask for bread 3 times, but the quality of the food made up for the service!  Might bring wifey back."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner at this restaurant- the ambiance is wonderful. It's casual but still classy- the service is very good. We had the pork belly appetizer which was delicious. I had the scallops and my husband had the pork chop which was amazing as well. The Wigwam is always gorgeous and we enjoyed the views. Definitely adding this into our regular fun dinner date nights."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a special occasion and this place did not disappoint. We reserved a private dining room for the family and they were very accommodating. They're a lil pricey but worth it! Food was great and service was awesome. Would definitely recommend this place to all!"}
{"text":"Tonight was our worst experience ever eating here. We sat in the lounge because there were apparently no tables available for us in the dining room (never mind that the majority of tables remained vacant almost the entire 2 hours we were here). 

The service was forgetful and ridiculously slow. I understand that it was the last night for the Groupon but the restaurant was poorly prepared and extremely understaffed. We waited an hour for our food with very few acknowledgements from our server. She was sweet but had no sense of urgency and didn't really pay attention to her tables. She seemed very inexperienced to my husband and I (who was previously in the restaurant business), despite the 2013 \"employee since\" date on her name tag. 

Fortunately, the food was delicious (as usual!)...hence the two stars.  

Will probably return, just won't sit in the lounge and will make sure it's not a Groupon expiration night (because they won't be adequately staffed)."}
{"text":"Service was horrible here - safe yourself and walk to Red's Bar & Grill. The hostess sat on phone never acknowledged us - and food not worth the wait at all."}
{"text":"We feel that instead of the flavor of the food, they used cheese on practically every dish. The menu could use some updating to include more vegetable based options."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner at Litchfield's on Jan. 4, 2018.  In every respect, the dinner was \"superb.\"  We started off with the Spinach Dumplings and then she had the Endive Salad and I had the Mushroom Bisque.  We both had the Diver Scallops on a bed of butternut squash and cranberry risotto.  The food was perfectly prepared, graciously served by our waitress and all was encompassed in the quiet relaxing ambiance of the restaurant.  We would definitely return and recommend it highly.  We dined at 5:30pm on Thursday, Jan. 4th.  I prefer to fine dine during the week (M-Thurs) and early before the chefs are pressured with multi-dishes to prepare and the crowds arrive."}
{"text":"We dined at Litchfield's recently. After living in the West Valley for a year, we had not experienced the restaurant, and have heard wonderful comments of the food and the experience. Unfortunately, that was not so. It was all about the kitchen and the tardiness of our entrees. My husband had the cucumber gazpacho and I had the tomato medallion salad: both were excellent. The evening went downhill slowly and escalated after our main entree had  not arrived. after sitting in the restaurant for an hour and a half. We asked our waitress several times, of which she apologized and said the head chef was absent. At an hour and a half, my husband approached the manager of the whereabouts of our food, of which he pointed to my husbands dish. We waited five more minutes, got up and left. We left money for the glass of wine, ice tea, and our first courses. 
I am in disbelief how a fine dining restaurant cannot keep the patron informed of the parings of the food, and the timing. Yes, at a fine restaurant, I am prepared to wait 20-30 minute in between courses, but not an hour plus. After residing at our table for 1.5 hours, we left, and will not return. My advice to future patrons, is ask if the kitchen is running on time, just as we must do in a physician's office: wierd. 
I would have rated it no stars, however it own't allow me to post the review without indicating so."}
{"text":"Sadly I purchased a Groupon for this restaurant. I tried to make a reservation using the number provided and was not able to get an answer, so my party and I arrived Saturday night at the hostess station to put our name on the list. I was \"greeted\" by an extremely rude \"host\" who informed me that they did not have any such list and my best chance at a table would be \"I don't know, next Sunday?\" as he literally looked down his nose at me. (Sidenote: the restaurant is closed Sunday-Tuesday). I have stayed in the Casitas at the resort many times, and have eaten at Litchfield's and found it to be just ok, a hotel restaurant not really anything too special. I was going to give it another try, I am always looking for good options close to home. I have decided that I am going to forfeit my Groupon and not risk spending an extra dollar at Litchfield's. There are too many great options in Phoenix to waste time in a place with rude service."}
{"text":"I had been hearing great things about Litchfield's, so we finally tried it out during our recent stay at the Wigwam in August.  First, they start the table off with a delicious sourdough bread with garlic butter and sea salt...it was so good I could have just stopped there and been happy.  We shared the spinach dumplings with a sweet tomato chutney to start (a little different than I was expecting, but still good), the salmon with potatoes, mushrooms, corn and mustard for my entree, the filet, green beans and cheddar grits for my husband's entree and we finished the delicious meal splitting a peach and tart cherry cobbler.  The food was tasty, the service was great, the decor was lovely and the atmosphere was lively.  Definitely worth a visit...and a return visit!"}
{"text":"A splurge of an evening to celebrate good friends leaves a so-so memory of a meal.  New York strip, trout, salmon, and pork chops were very good, however the steak was cold. Cheese platter was excellent but local honey ran off the serving board and waitress appeared inconvenienced to clean off sticky table. When Beau requests a cup of coffee, the waitress runs off to get it but neglects to ask if anyone else would like a cup. Plenty of apparent servers but waitress is harried. Noise, service, and ambience not scaled with food and bill.  Bummer."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants. Our go-to on special occasions and our favorite for steaks...better than Flemings.  We have been coming here for years and have had good food and service almost every time. 
We went today and both had the Veal Osso Bucco that was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I love Litchfields for its location, outdoor seating and ever changing fresh menu. This review is for the lounge and outdoor seating. The appetizer menu is good, love the strawberry salad. Had the sliders and they were bland. Service is mediocre, depends who the server is and how many tables they have. I always will go back, but feel they could do better."}
{"text":"Ok, my previous review was based on the dish I picked which was the pork chops. (not the best thing on the menu).  But this update is to talk about what others at my table really liked, one was the trout, which was really good and the other was the New York steak strip which was tender and also good. I still believe this place is on the expensive side. But to be fair I thought i'd update my review concerning what others at my table thought.  Just be cognizant that this place is pricey and at least some dishes aren't worth it."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere.  They graciously accept living social coupons.  The food is delicious.  My husband had the ORGANIC SCOTTISH SALMON with pumpkin risotto, I had the CEDAR RIVER ARIZONA FILET MIGNON and chose the Crème fraîche potato side dish.  There was live music, the staff were extremely attentive and we WILL gladly return at any time in the future even without a coupon.  Our bill was $121 before using the coupon and that included a $45 bottle of wine.  The prices are not all too high when you think about what you can spend on a date in a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I had Easter Brunch today at Litchfield's in Litchfield Park, AZ.  We reserved the four course Easter Brunch..not the buffet.  We were seated promptly and given the menu for wine and the specialized 4 course sit down meal. Our drink order was taken and we both ordered the identical fare from the menu.  Our server was Charlotte.  

Charlotte brought us our drinks....water and coffee (no cream).  The water was great (with lemon and ice).  The coffee was tepid.  A starter plate with one croissant, two mini muffins, one scone and one danish were brought to the table after we gave Charlotte our order.  I asked Charlotte if we could have some fresh HOT coffee....she smiled and said she would.  

We had to request hot coffee a second time.  

Our mixed berry appetizer was pleasant.  It came with Brie cheese, shaved pistachios and a toated baguette.  

The entree left much to be desired.  We ordered the Margherita Eggs Benedict.  Our eggs were cold.  After eating the first egg, i stopped eating it since it was cold.  We did not complain to the server or to management.  We did not want to whine.  

The hot coffee arrived and was good.  

Dessert was presented on a pastry table that was close to our seating.  They were okay.

The biggest complaint we have is that the french doors to the patio seating were wide open allowing for multiple flies to enter the dining area and the open kitchen.  Not just one fly or two, but multiple flies that were buzzing the food and the customers.  In addition to the presence of flies was a bird (a grackle or raven) which hopped and flew into the dining area and rested on a plate of tarts that were on the dessert table.  Not once, but three times did the bird zoom in and out of the dining area, until an employess appeared with a dish towel to chase the bird away.  The tarts were not replaced nor were any other plates of dessert while we were still there.  Our server did not come around asking us if we needed anything and I  requested additional coffee....which she brought to the table, but failed to bring any to my husband at the same time, nor did she ask him if he wanted more coffee....he had to request it himself.

Sadly we will not be dining at Litchfield's again, nor would we recommend it to anyone else.  It is not as though we do not eat out regularly.  We do.  The price per meal was $54.00 each.  We have had better food and much better service at places that were less known and less expensive."}

In the Phoenix Metro Area there are an abundant amount of restraunts that  cater towards fine dining, however, few stand out.  Litchfields is a fine dining establishment that defintely stands out among the rest. 

Litchfields is part of the Wigwam Resort in Litchfield Park, AZ, which attracts a mixture of vacationers, locals,  and business clientele. 

Litchfields has an open design, with a rustic decor emphasizing the history of Goodyear and the Litchfield family. If you're in a adventurous or romantic mood dinning outside under the stars is recommended; as outdoor fireplaces and heaters are provided for those willing to brave the chill of the evening air.

The service at Litchfields is impeccable and second to none. Our server was knowledgable, and attentive without being intrusive. All the questions we had reference menu items, wines, and salads were answered and suggestions were given based on our preferences. 

After placing our order we brought a nice half boule of warm bread, which was delicious. The food at Litchfields is all fresh, organic and locally sourced to the greatest extent possible. 

I ordered the Filet and my dinner companion had the the New York Strip. Both entrées were very generous cuts. The meat was very tender, flavorful, and  rivaled those served at any high-end steak house. You can chose from a half dozen side dishes (carrots, asparagus, heirloom potatoes) to accompany your steak. 

Although I was completely satisfied and full.  I had to finish off with a nice creme brule. A perfect ending to an amazing dining experience."}
{"text":"First off I'd like to say I'm biased to the atmosphere because I love the Wigwam. Started out with a friendly hostess. Appetizers of pork belly & charcuterie/cheese platter were out of this world. I'm not even a pork fan, but that belly was amazing. Entrees of duck, filet mignon & pasta were all great. My father-in-law (a huge foodie) said his duck was some of the best he's ever had. My filet was slightly over cooked, but as a person who doesn't eat rare meat, slightly over is better than under. It was still moist, tender & flavorful. The side of potatoes were just ehhh. Fried squash blossoms were delicious. No dessert. We all enjoyed the experience & would return. I don't find the menu overpriced at all. Tiny downside was asking for a glass of ice I never received -- not a big deal at all."}
{"text":"Wish i could give it higher rating because i do like the place. The history on the walls as you walk to the restaurant, the furnishings, the art work, all incredible. The food is hit or miss, sometimes it's fabulous, other times not so much. The service is always good. I enjoy watching the chefs as they prepare the food at the front of the restaurant where virtually all the tables can watch."}
{"text":"We did not like the pork chop and Buffalo. The mac & cheese was wonderful.

The decor was nice."}
{"text":"We were looking for someplace to celebrate our Anniversary and have never eaten on this side of town, we chose Litchfield's after receiving some recommendations from others who had eaten there. The restaurant is located in the Wigwam Resort, hidden way in the back, so ask for directions. Upon arrival we were seated right away. Walking in I loved the openness of the dining area and how you were able to watch the food get prepared. I noticed that they also had a few private dinning areas, which would be perfect for large parties to come eat.

To start, they brought bread and butter. One of the best I have had in town, we ate it so quickly that they brought us more. Then we had the ahi tuna. It was delicious and the mustard on top complimented the dish perfectly. For the main meal we had the Colorado Lamb Rack and the Brick Roasted Chicken with a side order of the smoked Gouda mac and cheese. The chicken was cooked perfectly and I loved the concept of polenta waffles, but they were a bit dry even with the honey on top. As a lover of mac and cheese, that dish did not disappoint.

To end the evening we received a complimentary dessert because we were celebrating our anniversary. I think that is always a nice touch when a restaurant does that."}
{"text":"Went there last night because we bought a Groupon for it. Beautiful ambiance, and the kitchen is right in the middle of the dining room which is really neat because you can watch the chef and team cook.  Had the cheese tray, which was delicious! Still can't figure out though why they give three crackers to a table of two...we had to ask for an additional cracker because there was so much cheese. Really good though. Then I ordered the lamb which was the special of the evening...recommended by both the manager, and waitress. They must have got a good deal on the lamb because they were pushing it hard. Turned out to be pretty bad.  I asked for it medium rare and it was charred and well done. But the waitress was a doll and switched it out for the ribeye which was much better, still a little tough but at least it was pink inside. Overall a good experience. I would head back for a cheese tray, glass of merlot and the ambiance."}
{"text":"Litchfield's is overrated. I usually do not complain about my meal, but when you're spending $300+ for fine dining you expect near perfection. The The Mediterranean sea bass was dry and plated over a mound of vegetables which were also dry. There was no sauce whatsoever. I felt like I was eating fish jerky. When the manager came over and asked about our meals, I mentioned how dry the fish was. It was not palatable. He insisted that he take my meal and make another. He genuinely cared about our dining experience as did our lovely waitress. I reluctantly requested the salmon. In short order a new meal was placed before me. The salmon was delicious however it was still plated over a mound of dry, bland vegetables. While our meals lacked in flavor, the customer service rated very high. Fish entrees are challenging to retain moisture because it's very easy to overcook and dry out fish. That's why fish entrées typically are served in a broth or sauce of some kind. Maybe drizzle some of the black mussels broth over the fish to make it more palatable. I might not have said anything if there was an overcompensating flavorful sauce. My husband's beets appetizer was bland as well. I recommend going to Ocotillo in Phoenix. They have the most phenomenal beets I've ever eaten in my life!! Smoked beets over honey ricotta and chopped pistachios. Wow! The special tomato salad was very good however the teaspoon size of ricotta cheese was just not enough. Why bother even adding it to the plate? So where our meals lacked in flavor, Litchfield's scored high in service. That's why I gave it only three stars. We will probably not return as there are many other restaurants which serve incredible food while also providing fantastic service and at a lower cost."}
{"text":"I couldn't decide whether to leave three or four stars. I think the food is primarily decent, although the appetizers could certainly use some work.
The waitstaff is always phenomenal, and very charming.
The last time we were there, we sat on the patio near the fireplace and all staff was very accommodating ensuring that we had a fire, and keeping it going throughout the night.

That being said, for those who have been here, the kitchen is set up in the middle of the dining area which is wonderful for the patrons who would like to watch their meal prepared. 

However, we instead had the pleasure of watching the head chef flirting with a very young waitress for several hours, and not tending to the kitchen or staff as one would expect. It had gone on so long, I couldn't believe that he was even working in the kitchen, let alone the head chef. 

I actually asked around, and learned that this is par for the course, and complaints have been made yet have gone ignored regarding his behavior.

I understand the chef is young but he could certainly take a tip from chefs such as Christopher fromChristopher's at the Biltmore. Patrons generally like a chef to make the rounds asking how their  meal was and checking on quality, rather than attempting to hit on young waitstaff in view of the entire restaurant.

Just a thought. One that apparently has been raised several times and gone ignored.

As for the food, I have had all the steaks, the baked chicken, and the asparagus-all fantastic.

The wild mushrooms, every time I ordered them have tasted unwashed. I want to love them so much, I can't figure out what the issue is.

I think there's some minor tweaks needed, but I still feel like this is one of the best places on the west side."}
{"text":"The meal we had was 5 star quality. Service was prompt. Great outside views and ambiance. Just advice order an extra side of the potatoes to bring home"}
{"text":"Delicious food every time.  Their short ribs are exquisite and so is the salmon. Service is always terrific and the atmosphere is type you want to keep coming back too. We weren't disappointment and will be back again soon.."}
{"text":"I didn't see that coming.

I never have been to an upscale resort/hotel that had a restaurant that was ever worth the money and have always left disappointed. Not only did my family not leave disappointed, but we left very impressed.

My family and I stopped by for dinner at Litchfield's.   The setting is awesome. Very relaxed, comfortable, and a perfect place for a future romantic dining experience. The service was great. We never had a glass that was not full or bread that was not available. Now for the meal, everything was great. We started with their cheese board and spinach dumplings. The board was loaded with items, almost more than we could eat. Almost. The dumplings were good and the tomato jam that came with the dish was tasty. For our entrees, we had the sea bass, ribeye, and scallops. All were wonderful. The sea bass was mild tasting but very flavorful. The ribeye was wonderful and for only $40, a real bargain for how good it was. Last but not least the scallops were awesome. So many places offer scallops and risotto and every time the dish is so average. Not the case with their scallop and risotto. It was full of so much great flavor and one I would order again. For dessert, we had the panna cotta and I believe the chocolate torte. Both were so dang good. The panna cotta was was smooth and had so many different textures. Same can be said for the torte and was so sweet, which I prefer. If I was forced to pick one, the panna cotta was the winner.

Overall, we had just an amazing dining experience and so glad we stopped by. If I could make one complaint, I ordered a Moscow mule, which was great. Sadly though, it was not served in the traditional copper mug. I hate that. The mug really does serve a purpose, or at least it does probably more so in my mind but dang it, I love the mug. Anyhow, just an awesome dining experience at Litchfield's and will go back again. They may just change my mind on how I view resort restaurants."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly good.  We've returned about 5 times now over the past year. Here is what we've gathered.

Why go there:
It's got a charming dining room with unique custom furniture, the tables look like they had been crafted by some talented carpenters... If you are a fan of the reclaimed wood furniture movement, you'll enjoy the place.  The steaks are outstanding, grilled over fire that has this beautiful smokey taste to it.  Their pastas are also very well done, the menu changes seasonally with a few staples on the menu, with many items locally sourced which is always a plus.

Don't miss:
The Cedar River Ribeye.  Don't get it past Medium Rare, it's a good size, I'd guess 16 oz before hitting the fire.  We like to have it with the gouda mac.  My wife loves the filet, the wagyu short ribs were well worth the money as well.  This place can cook meat!  Their bread complimentary is always a highlight, especially served with that whipped herbed butter.

Tip: 
The Wigwam is a very relaxed resort, no one will know you are not staying at the resort and if you only come to eat at Litchfield's, you won't feel weird.  After dinner, hang out at the Wigwam bar outside for some live tunes on weekends.  Litchfield's menu though, doesn't echo anywhere else but within the restaurant, so get your fill there for the best food in the resort."}
{"text":"This place has been on our bucket list for years and we finally were able to dine here for my husbands birthday. Every bite from dinner to dessert was phenomenal! The atmosphere was lovely. I was uneasy about how the service would be, as we were using a Groupon and a previous reviewer had mentioned a lack of service when using one. We are generous tippers. My advice to the management is twofold: train the servers not to assume that if a Groupon is being used, that the diner is somehow\"cheap\". Also, have everyone shadow Colleen. I regretted not giving our younger server more than 10% on the total bill. She was good. But to overhear Colleen at the other tables giving heartfelt recommendations and descriptions of what those brilliant chefs were cooking, and where it came from, left us feeling underwhelmed by our service in comparison. We did mention our occasion and my husband was offered a free dessert, which was very kind. Upon our return we will ask for Colleen. She clearly loves what she does! And kudos to the chefs!  We appreciate your excellent execution of our meals:)"}
{"text":"Allegeini red wine was the least expensive per glass on the menu $9 per 5oz . I'd say it was worth every cent. 

My husband ate the Arizona filet mignon. It was a fantastic cut of meat but it was undercooked when asked for medium it was more like rare.

I had the fettuccine pasta with tomato olive and spinach it was simple healthy and delicious!

I would say the overall experience was wonderful but I love eating at restaurants that use local vendors."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here while visiting Phoenix for the weekend. The atmosphere and food is excellent. My husband ordered a steak and it came out overcooked but they were quick to fix their mistake and brought him a new steak. The service was great and we will definitely be back the next time we are in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"With all the good yelp ratings, I was disappointed in the visit and the food.  When we were seated, I walked passed the kitchen and saw the ribeye. 
 OH man...  Smells so good.   I got my food and it was a little tasteless, but the house fries were good.  The service was very slow too.  The environment is very nice."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for a delicious meal made from quality ingredients and friendly, sharp service, then make yourself a reservation at Litchfield's.

Groupon makes me try new restaurants and an expiring Groupon brought me here last Saturday night for dinner. I was not alone in my procrastination, as they were packed early in the evening, leaving me with an 8pm dinner reservation for two.

The booth we were seated in was comfortable and the atmosphere was warm, inviting and not formal at all, which I was thankful for. I was thankful for this because I was wearing shorts and flip flops as were some of the other diners. It's a golf resort establishment, so wear something with a collar but no need for a jacket or tie, y'all.

We didn't do the Restaurant Week menu- it was not an option to be paired with Groupon- so we ordered the charcuterie plate and I opted for the Cedar River AZ ribeye and my main squeeze ordered the pan roasted halibut. *FYI- the menu on Yelp is old and dusty and not at all close to what they're serving now so find that here:http://wigwamarizona.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Litchfields-Menu-Summer-2015F.pdf

Servers brought warm sourdough on the half-loaf with house made herb butter. Delicious and not too overwhelming portion wise. You ask for more, and they'll bring you some. 

The kitchen is open to the dining room and I mean it's one of the more transparent food prep and fire areas you'll see at a restaurant. There's a wood-fired grill and oven with a gas range next to it, each one helmed by its own chef in clear view of the dining room should you choose to see how they work the food orders for the waitstaff.

For $15, the charcuterie plate was crazy good and the portions were enough for 4 people. Duck prosciutto, hot coppa ham, dried chorizo, some fresh white cheeses (cheese should never be yellow or American), corn nuts made in the kitchen, some bomb ass olives, pickles and small slices of grilled bread. Damn good, people.

Plates were timed perfectly as our entrees arrived less than 5 minutes after we finished destroying the appetizer. 

The presentations are not crazy artistic with lots of sauces drizzled and things on plates, but my steak and her fish filet looked outstanding. The ribeye was served with garlic mashed yukon golds and a nice, smoky red wine sauce while the halibut was laid atop some wild mushrooms of several varieties, baby spinach and snap peas. 

Both the steak and the fish were cooked to perfection- with the halibut having that golden crust that makes for terrific flavor and a medium rare ribeye from the wood fire over cast iron grates. Both entrees were delicious and the portions were large but not overwhelming. 

I ain't new to eating good food so believe me when I say that we had great service and a dynamite meal at Litchfield's. I don't know what the deal is with the other reviews dissing the place. I will definitely be back for dinner.

If you have the time, check out the extensive collection of historic photos from the early days of the resort and Goodyear/ Litchfield Park. The resort has stunning grounds and the furniture is boss."}
{"text":"Best Filet Mignon on the planet!! Wow. After the first time, I've been talking about it and 6 months later I visit again, this time with my Mom who agreed - it was a 10. Really, incredible. We bought the groupon for 25$ for 60$ worth, and shared a house salad, then each got the 38$ filet meal which includes a side- mine green beans, hers smoked Gouda Mac and cheese. Woooooow, that Mac and cheese! I like that it is in a resort hotel, so no rigid dress code, and they have entrees on the menu for 20$, so very affordable for a high end place. They cook everything out in the open and the chefs are truly amazing to be able to watch the multitasking and brilliant things they serve up. Also, their farm to fresh idea is really great. Service is fantastic, you will feel extremely welcome by everyone you come in contact with. Can't wait to visit again!!"}
{"text":"Of the many many many times we have eaten here, tonight was by far the worst! It's almost as if the place is slipping into a franchised mentality. Ordered drinks and after nearly 15 mins the server (term used loosely here) came back to ask us what we would like to order. We went with the cheese platter to start with, which was waaaay too much food for an appetizer. It used to be a small tasting, perfect for 2 but it appears they are piling the food on without regard to presentation or food costs. In addition, the waitress never came back to check in us. We would have ordered another drink halfway through the platter but were never asked-only given water and bread from the helpful staff. 
After 45 mins the server FINALLY came back, never asked about the platter and offered to bring us more drinks but never suggested we order entrees. We were shocked!! This is not how servers treat patrons willing to spend $100+. We sat there an additional 45 mins with just our drinks and the bread basket between us!! If we hadn't been so upset and wanting to have a nice evening out, it could have seemed like something straight out of a sitcom-completely comical. The server was the opposite of professional. Needless to say, the next time we were able to flag her down, we asked for the check and went to the bar to order more food and drink to continue our evening. 
My advice is go to reds or across the street to ol' pueblo, that way the prices aren't hiked due to \"fine dining\" and the service is by far better."}
{"text":"Litchfield's is the renovated restaurant at the Wigwam Resort.  This takes the place of Red's Steakhouse.  The 80-seat dining room is set off by a wood fired show kitchen in the center of the restaurant.  We were surprised by the need for a reservation on a Tuesday night.  We used to show up at Red's and simply sit down.  Since the restaurant has only been open for three weeks with a lot of buzz, we should have anticipated the wait.  Thankfully, the bar was well stocked and we only had to wait for 20 minutes.

For appetizers, we ordered the fettucini on the recommendation of our server. What a great dish!!  She wasn't lying.  It was seasoned so well.  We also ordered the prosciutto with dates.  This was a little less fantastic.  The prosciutto tasted great but it really didn't tie into the dates.  It was like the dates were just set on top of the meat as a garnish.  I was disappointed with this presentation.  The flavors were good.  Maybe tie them together a little better?

My main course was the two 4 oz. fillet.  I ordered medium rare and they were served over a bed of roasted garlic potatoes.  I could cut my meat with a fork.  It was so tender.  The meat was Arizona raised (and Arizona eaten - I might add).  Great main course.  My colleagues were equally satisfied by the trout and salmon dishes they ordered.

For dessert we shared the creme brulee and the bananas foster.  I really don't know why the bananas foster wasn't flamed table side.  I was very disappointed in this.  I've been to some fantastic restaurants who flame the dessert table side....let's face it...it's entertaining as well.  Both desserts hit the spot.  Great flavors.

Overall, I would give 4 stars.  The portion sizes were very well controlled.  I really appreciated this as all the dishes were more guilty pleasures than dinner.  My complaint was the lack of an after dinner drink menu.  The server was not educated on after dinner drinks and tried to fake it.  I mentioned to the bar tender on the way out that they're losing money here.  We did finally settle on a nice port, but later I found that they had Macallan 25 and was disappointed that I missed out there.  

If they fix the after dinner drink menu and the flamed bananas foster, it's easily five stars.  The service was fast, efficient and friendly.  I would recommend trying the place out.  You won't be disappointed, just call ahead first."}
{"text":"MR C & I have now been married for 6 months. We had our wedding recption on the patio of Litchfields. So, on our 6 month anniversary we returned to the Wigwam and decided to have dinner at Litchfields.  

We started off with the cheese plate: OMG this ROCKS. We had it at our wedding dinner (post cocktail reception on the patio) and again the following evening at our intimate dinner. The housemade crackers, the local honey to drizzle on the goat cheese and the fresh pomogranite seeds... I die thinking about it.. YUM.  Next, we share the beet salad.. again delish.. a little overload on the goat cheese, pecans, etc... but delish. And finally we shared the New York Strip... ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.. perfection, delish. The cabernet sauce and the wood fired onions...the flavor of the steak.. one incredible bite. WOW.  Top it all off with the lovely and inexpesive Penfolds Merlot and it was one lovely dinner. 

The atmosphere, the quality of the food, the excellent service... and of course our memories... we love this place.  We love the casual yet classy feel of it.  

And dont forget to check out the patio!"}
{"text":"If I had to make a list of choices for a \"last meal\", Litchfield's would rank at or near the top of my list.  The house-baked sourdough bread and luscious local butter to start, followed by an organic Scottish salmon filet on a bed of the tastiest prepared kale I've ever had and a substance unknown to me called \"goat quark\" among other things were most pleasing.  On this, my third dining experience here, we finally saved room to split a dessert, and the light and creamy goat-cheese cheesecake, described by my friend as \"orgasmic\", made us glad we did - except maybe about the \"split\" part.  After the first bite I think we were coveting a full serving.  It was utterly, wonderfully different in texture and density, and a smooth delight in taste.  It would have been worth the journey in itself.
  The polished concrete floors and a several large dining parties made for a noisy dining room but not to the extent of being unpleasant. Service was good, as always.  The serving staff was a little younger than on my prior visits and perhaps a tad less polished, but always attentive; my water glass never got below half full.  Of water alone I am a heavy drinker so that required some attentiveness. A wonderful meal and dining experience."}
{"text":"Yummy food
 Great service. Amazing Resort. Great night  with enertainment and music. Love the atmosphere and staff. Pleasant and quick service"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience from valet to dessert!! Boyfriend and I were both very impressed. We were graciously greeted the moment we walked in by a man in a suit who walked us to the restaurant. Our server was knowledgeable about all the items on the menu and suggested some things to try when we were waffling between a few different choices. Cheese trio platter was sooooo good. I'll be getting that every time we come here and it was the perfect size for the two of us to share. I had the beet salad which was very good. Love the candied walnuts in it. Boyfriend had the lamb which he said was perfect: Tender, juicy and delicious!  The breads that came at the beginning of the meal were obviously homemade and fresh. Even the coffee was good. It's very rare for us to find a place that does it right so completely but I think we've found it.  Service was fantastic! Our glasses were never empty and we were well attended without being pestered. Could it be possible I can't find anything to criticize?! I can't. Love this place."}
{"text":"The service was good. They mad sure we had everything we needed. The drinks and appetizers we delivered to the table very fast. It was a busy night but it took an hour for us to get our food. I had the duck breast and it wasn't very good. My wife had the pork chop and it was over cooked. I will give this place another try I think that they were a little overwhelmed last night."}
{"text":"Very beautiful restaurant and great atmosphere. The bread and garlic butter that is brought out when you first arrive was heavenly and the bus boy was pretty prompt with bringing out some fresh bread once we quickly finished the first batch. The food was phenomenal. I had the spaghetti and it was not what I was expecting in the traditional sense of spaghetti (had goat cheese, kale, and mushrooms) but it was so delicious! One of the best meals I've had in a while. My boyfriend got the rib eye steak with a side of potatoes and was very happy with his meal as well. Cool view of the kitchen while you eat too. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Clubby ambience great for the occasion .warm welcome.cool politely hostile semi knowledgable waitress a definite detraction. Assurances of USDA prime rendered a smallish 20oz. Porterhouse 6/10. Prime rib a dull pink rewarmed  joke . Salad was sad. Wine list amateurish. Dessert very good.
The owners need to try Club A in NYC,or , despite the price Ruth's Chris.
. Better ,BobR's backyard for charcoal grilled organic  grass fed corn finished bone in heaven.
  Give this a pass;i=Avoid."}
{"text":"This was our first experience since the remodel and likely our last. It is very pricey for what we get.  The dinner salad was served without a dressing and with a smear of what appears to be chocolate  at the bottom of the plate. Chocolate in a dinner salad? come on!  It also contained  what we think were figs  that tasted like gummy bears. My duck breast neither tasted nor looked like duck breast but was served with a delicious rhubarb confit .  My husband enjoyed his Scottish salmon served with what looked and tasted like bread cubes.  We weren't sure!  The main dishes came without vegetables so you had to pay an additional $7-8 for a veggie which added to the price of the main course.  We did not trust the deserts to be  homemade so did not order.
All in all, Litchfield's has an impressive wine menu; a limited dinner menu ; high prices and attempts at culinary novelties that seem to fall short somehow."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  The Wigwam Resort has a long history, and it should have a great restaurant.  Unfortunately, they stumbled with the service and the food.  The atmosphere is nice, but it is so darned loud!!  Difficult to have a conversation here.  We liked the open kitchen and the mission style ceilings.

The service started off okay, and our waiter seemed attentive.  The bread was delicious--warm sourdough minis with good butter. However, it took our waiter and his manager about 15 minutes to find the wine that we ordered.  The appetizers came out quickly, but then there was a huge lag waiting for our main courses....like a half hour.  My wife had the butternut squash soup with a mole sauce, which was really good.

The two main courses that we tried were the sea bass and the chicken.  The sea bass was good, but the accompanying veggies were just okay.  The chicken was completely overcooked and the butternut squash gnocchi were gummy and disgusting.  

Because the food took so much time to come out, we opted to skip dessert, which I rarely do.  But the options were so boring: chocolate cake, blah, blah, blah.  The manager did knock a few bucks off our bill given the issues that we had with the food and slowness of the kitchen.

I will try it again, just to see if they improve things, the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"The good: We dined as a part of a party of seven and 6 of us opted for the \"5 C's of Arizona\" Menu. Cattle, Climate, Cotton, Copper and Citrus.
The menu was cleverly created and was well presented and prepared (pic of the menu posted). The table favorite was the made to order cheese curd. This cheese was literally made while we were enjoying the previous course. For $55 this is really an excellent deal for a 5 course meal. One member of our party ordered the house salad and the filet mignon. 
The not as good: For a restaurant in a resort of this quality and prestige, my expectations from a service standpoint are pretty high. The wait staff were very polite. However, here's where the place fell short. 
We ordered a few bottles of wine during the course of the meal and the server always began pouring wine where the bottle was last placed. This resulted in short pours as he went around the table. I would have expected the wine to be poured first in the ladies' glasses and just enough to result in even pours around the table. 
New tableware had to be requested by someone at each course. When dishes were cleared and knives & forks were removed, they weren't replaced unless requested. 
Our one dining partner who didn't select the 5 course menu got to watch us eat for three of the 5 courses. A lot of restaurants will present an amuse bouche to a diner who doesn't opt for a multi-course dinner. I realize it isn't the kitchen's fault one person is a holdout, but I've always felt it was a class move to provide such unexpected items to guests. 
An explanation of the dish served was never described or explained. I would have expected the dishes on 5 C's of Arizona menu would have garnered some descriptive presentation. We were left to to our own to tie the intent of the dish to the category. 
So, my overall impression is Litchfield's makes really good food and while the wait staff are really nice folks, there are some training opportunities to take this potentially 5 star restaurant to the next level."}
{"text":"I have lived in the Phoenix area for 2 years and Litchfield's had the best food so far.  The pork chop was perfect.  The smoked gouda mac and cheese was so rich and decadent.  

A reservation was easily booked at the desired time on trip advisor.  It was also the most expensive meal I have had here in the valley but it was worth it.  The service was very good.  It's not something I will do all the time but we will be back."}
{"text":"Pork chops were amazing! Additionally  we had a cheese platter, a bottle of wine and heirloom tomatoes...oh and a creme brûlée you would have thought we had Chinese take out! They had no take home bags! Our food was sent in multiple white plastic bags, like Chinese take out! Save the whales."}
{"text":"If it were black tie it would be a five!  This place is undoubtedly the best upscale restaraunt in the west valley.  The service is great, the food quality is awesome, and the ambience is upscale and refreshing.  While casual is welcomed, I always feel under dressed without slacks and a decent shirt.  You can also sit outside and enjoy a few drinks and occasionally a live band on the weekends.  You almost forget you are in Goodyear -- its like being tucked away in a mini Scottsdale.  The only negative comment I can come up with is the noise level.  The acoustic designer failed.  Dinner in the main restaurant is loud.  Other than that, this place is great.  Be prepared to spend some decent cash (maybe $25.00 per person) but you will enjoy the hospitality and the food."}
{"text":"Lovely foie gras and sea bass. Perfectly prepared and a wonderful evening for my in-laws 47th anniversary."}
{"text":"My family and I decide we would all have Christmas dinner on Monday night here. We sat down at 7pm, didn't get food until after 8:30pm and didn't leave until after 9pm. So on top of slow service, our orders were wrong, food tasted good at the time but as soon as I got home, I got very very sick. All night I suffered from the dinner. I'd go again, but it'll be awhile. My mother also ordered a filet mignon and got sick."}
{"text":"Perfect date night place.  The food and service were excellent.  When you sit outside you can get the feel of the resort and it's like you've been transported far away from home even though you may live just a mile or two away!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding.  The new management under Mr. George McGann has really changed this place around.  There restaurant is newly remodeled and a great place to eat.  There are lots of great food choices and we recommend this restaurant to all of our friends."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is point on, the food is good. The waitress misunderstood my request about my order, I was cheated out of my goat quark and other small dish fixings.  No biggie really, but detail is important. She also talked a little too loud, but was super nice! My water glass was always kept full from the water guy, and the salmon is A1!!!  My husbands steak was excellent, as were his big steak fries. He loved his coconut creamed corn chowder soup.  It's a little over priced, can get more almost  anywhere else for much cheaper, but if it's the \"whoo- who\" you are looking for on a nice night out, this could be the place! 
I find it funny that the Manager made a reply thanking me for the 5 star rating....  
Um, it's 4 star, lol."}
{"text":"This is our first time at Litchfield's, and it was outstanding.  Food, atmosphere, cocktails, service by Deon -- everything was first rate! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the upscale dining experience over at Litchfield's in the SW Valley.  Thanks to Yelp for saving us from driving to Scottsdale for a birthday dinner for my daughter who has moved to Avondale.  The service and atmosphere of the entire resort is top of the line and just beautiful.  You have to walk though the bar to access the entrance.  The kitchen is awesome because you can see everything getting cooked right in front of you with no walls and it was the cleanest restaurant kitchen I have ever seen in my life.  The food was pretty darn good also.  I ordered the prime rib-eye steak special with crab meat covering it (see pic), my daughter got the spare rib special, and my wife got the salmon.   My steak was just ridiculous and pretty sure I could have used a butter knife to cut it.  The flavor was just spectacular with a marbling taste, also had a burgundy sauce (garlic/buttery flavored) that was just perfect with the steak and pretty large portion.  I did not care for crab meat on top of the steak but the mashed potatoes were good as well.  My daughter loved her spare rib which was small but we used a fork to cut it and she had some avocado that was slightly fried with batter which was very good and different.  My wife thought the salmon was very good but the sides did not compliment is very well.  Overall the food and experience was just perfect for our occation."}
{"text":"We live in Litchfield and like to keep our business local.  Litchfield's is very expensive, which would be OK if the food was outstanding.  After reading other reviews, the only constant is that the food is inconsistent.  That doesn't work for me - especially for an \"upscale\" restaurant.
Have no plans to go back."}
{"text":"We just got home from an incredibly delicious meal here.  The first thing you notice when walking through the door is the smell from the mesquite grill.  When we arrived at the Wig Wam Resort, I wasn't sure what I was leaning towards having, but after I got a whiff of that aroma, I knew I was having a steak.  The restaurant was bright and nicely decorated.  The tables weren't on top of each other, which gives you a sense of space.  We were seated at a table by the window, and had a lovely view of the fountain.

Our waitress, Holly, was very friendly and answered any questions we had about the menu.  The menu isn't large, but has something for everyone.  My husband and I usually tend to choose similarly, and tonight was no different.  We both had the caesar salad and filet mignon.  The salads were wonderful, and we were trying to get every last bite off the plate.  I liked that the dressing was under the salad (I've never seen that before), and actually really enjoyed it that way.  We both ordered our filets medium, mine butterflied, and they were grilled to perfection.  There was a demi-glaze that was the perfect balance for the meat.  My husband got sides of potatoes and the gouda mac n' cheese.  He couldn't get enough of them and was practically licking the plate.  I had sides of baby carrots and green beans with cheddar melted over them.  They were both delicious!

We decided to splurge and have dessert.  My husband got a prickly pear creme brulee, and I had a warm peach and pecan cobbler with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream melting over it.  Do I need to tell you how delicious they both were??

This was a wonderful date night out, and the meal really made it extra special."}
{"text":"I really loved this place! The food tastes amazing and fresh i ate the ribeye and as big as it is for a lady i almost ate it all!! (If it wasnt because i was with some business partners haha) the pork belly nachoa are to dieee for will deff come back and eat some more!!"}
{"text":"Awesome hospitality! Food was fresh and tasty! We recommend being waited on by Cristina:) she was sweet and helpful!"}
{"text":"Extremely fancy, extremely expensive, and extremely great! We had the Blackhead Ahi and Frito Mixto for our appetizers and the Colorado Lamb Rack and Wild Boar for the entree. It was amazing! The staff was a little inexperience however, the atmosphere was great and I loved the resort it was connected with! SO classy!"}
{"text":"Our original plan was to meet friends at Red's for happy hour, however once we arrived there was a sign posted that it was closed for a private event. So we went to Litchfield's. This was our first visit so we were not aware that it's reservation only, however the bar area is open seating so fortunately we were able to be seated right away. I would've given this restaurant 5 stars but the two hostess' at the door lacked personality and friendliness. One didn't even acknowledge us, and the other one acted like she could've cared less if we stayed or not. Our waitress/bartender made up for it, she was very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. The food was so delicious my husband and I cleaned our plates! I had the ribeye and he, the salmon. Our cocktails were just ok, dessert also amazing-raspberry cheesecake. The menu changes every few weeks, and the meat is prepared fresh in the main dining room-very cool! Pricing was high but to us worth every penny for the quality of our food, absolutely delicious! For 2 dinner entrees 4 cocktails and a dessert our tab was about 150-160. So this is definitely more of a place to visit for a special occasion. The atmosphere was very warm with a musician on the piano. We will return but WITH reservations next time!"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and accommodating and the atmosphere was delightful.  However the food was just OK and somewhat overpriced."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderfully prepared, fresh, creative and delicious food!  Perfect for celebrating a nice occasion!  The chef has perfected steaks and fish.  The sides (especially the Yukon mashed pot) were also wonderful!  I am a foodie and very discerning when it comes to good food and fine dining all over the world and would not hesitate to recommend this lovely country club restaurant to anyone who appreciates gourmet food and lovely ambiance!  My only suggestion would be that cuisine this good should be presented and served on tables with table cloths!  The exposed wood tables didn't seem nice enough for the beautiful dishes we thoroughly enjoyed."}
{"text":"My husband and I treated our neighbors to dinner on March 14th.
The place is beautifully decorated, the food and service was good, but the noise was too loud. There were two large tables near us with men drinking and they were very loud. We had a hard time talking to each other and it was very distracting. We're disappointed the manager didn't do something about it. Also, for the amount of food, the prices were too high. Disappointed in our first time."}
{"text":"I wanted to rate this place higher but my steak was overcooked, the portions for the sides were too small, and the prices are pretty high because almost all the entrees (except for the steak entrees) don't come with a side.

I ordered a glass of ice water with a lemon and it was great, the lemon was fresh.  Then our server brought out some fresh bread with some garlic butter.  It was very tasty.  I also ordered an IPA draft that they had on tap ($6, not horrible for a fine dining spot).  My entree was the ribeye steak ($33) and my side dish was the smoked macaroni and gouda cheese.  The side came with the steak entree.  My steak was overcooked.  It was too charred and burnt on the top. I was bummed out that it wasn't cooked how I requested.  I should have sent it back.  I really enjoyed the mac and cheese, but the portion was very small. 

My date ordered a 5 oz. glass of Riesling wine, a salad, a fish entree, and a vegetable side order.  She enjoyed all of her meal.

Our bill was $89 and some change.  Luckily, I used a $30 off coupon from GroupOn.

The customer service was top-notch, and the scenery outside was very nice."}
{"text":"I've been curious about Litchfield's for ages, but due to the cost, I never would have tried it without a Living Social deal. Now I can say we visited, though we're not likely to return.

The grounds of the Wigwam are quite lovely. Unfortunately, we saw more of them than intended because we had a terrible time finding the restaurant on the resort grounds. We had to ask several employees for help until we found our way through the labyrinth. I half-expected to encounter a minotaur or David Bowie. 

The ambiance of the restaurant was extraordinary. We sat by the doorway and overlooked a lawn where they were setting up for an event. The weather was perfect. The attentiveness of the staff was impressive. Our water glasses were kept full and we were regularly asked if we wanted more bread or if we needed anything else. 

The bread basket was delicious. I'm a bread snob and a home baker, and this was very good bread. To start, my husband ordered the Caesar salad while I had the house salad. My salad was good, though not extraordinary; I can make similar at home. My main course was the Scottish salmon with pumpkin risotto and Brussels sprouts. It was very good, though there were very few Brussels sprouts; I was glad I had the salad for more vegetables. The pumpkin risotto was a delight--perfect pumpkin flavor without being overwhelming. The cut of fish was good.

My husband had the ribeye. He enjoyed it, though he didn't hesitate to say that the steak at Fleming's is far better. Fleming's has set an awfully high bar there.

I had one of their signature cocktails, the Litchfield Lights. It was good--spiked pineapple juice.

We didn't partake of dessert. The selections didn't interest us.

It was a pleasant enough place, but I've had better food for a much cheaper price. If I wanted good farm-to-table cuisine I'd be more likely to visit a place like Palette at the Phoenix Art Museum."}
{"text":"Almost perfect!  The wait staff lacked the skills you find in your top-tier restaurants.  Other than that, outstanding.

Medium sized dining room, open, with a few booths placed in the middle (odd) and tables around the outside.  Very warm, and relaxing with an exposed kitchen and three or four busy chefs.

Simple, uncomplicated menu.  Food is absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection. 

A long time ago I banned myself from ordering pork chops in restaurants.  No matter how good the restaurant was, they always overcooked it.  Sticking to that tradition, I ordered the Baked Margherita Linguine  and it was outstanding and reasonably priced.  However, one in our party ordered the Wood Fired Pork Chop and it was out-of-this-world delicious!

Not only was that pork chop cooked to absolute perfection, it came with a drizzle of the most outstanding pork sauce I've ever tasted.  If I could learn to make that sauce, it would go on everything... including pancakes!

Great meal, great atmosphere, awkward, clumsy service.  Go!  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"We sat outside on the patio and could not have had a better evening. Our waiter was Deon. We were very well taken care of. He is friendly, attentive, considerate and knowledgeable . The food was amazing and the attention to detail was wonderful. I wish we could have heard the piano player a little more from inside."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! 
I gave five stars just based on the location, service and quality of food. The west valley doesn't have many options of great restaurants. 

The wait staff is responsive and gives great recommendations of wine and appetizers."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Wingwam Resort and decided to enjoy dinner at Litchfield's, which is located within the resort. Inside they had a nice decor with someone playing the piano. We decided to sit outside under the lights and by the fireplace. The host and waitress were both excellent. We ordered the lamb chops and ribeye steak. They were both cooked and seasoned perfectly. The thing that I will remember was actually the Gouda Mac and Cheese! That might have been the best Mac and Cheese I have ever had! Overall an amazing dinner in a beautiful place with great service."}
{"text":"Great upscale option in the West Valley

Took a coworker to Litchfield's for a working dinner and to celebrate a project well done.  We had heard that Colangelo and his partners bought the Wigwam and had made some drastic improvements, including to the main dining option.  Tip: You can park inside the gate and don't have to be a guest or member.  I parked outside and had to walk... apparently, just because I felt like being foolish.

Was impressed with the food quality and flavor.  They have an appealing menu for American ranch fare.  The steaks we had were cooked perfectly and flavorful without being over-seasoned.  Sides were good and the interior design of the restaurant was quiet and comfortable.  Dessert options were standard fare.  

Overall, there is nothing novel in terms of food and dishes, and what they serve is executed very well.

Service staff is par for the course.  Very nice, yet a clear step away from top tier. Attentive enough though, and you aren't left to wait too long between courses and paying for thing when ready to wrap up."}
{"text":"100% not worth the price. Had filet mignon and wife had salmon and Chilis could have produced about the same flavors. The only exceptional thing is the venue, live piano player and vibe of high end evening out."}
{"text":"We visited Litchfield's with a Groupon while doing a staycation.  The resort is awesome and the restaurant is real nice, great atmosphere and cool decor.  I went there with my wife and we noticed great diversity in the restaurant - younger couples, older couples and some families.  I'd say this place is better for couples and not kids.  The attire also varied - saw dresses and shirts with ties, but also saw polos with shorts and flip-flops (hint, its a resort).  I'd say casual will do - collared shirt and nice jeans or slacks for the fellas.  Food was great - had the park belly for the appetizer.  Very interesting as it was on Indian fry bread with an egg on top.  Very flavorful and a big cut, we were able to share this.  For our mains- my wife had the trout.  She loved it and has never had trout before - crispy on the skin side and great flavor.  I went with the ribeye, even though the rack of lamb looked great at the table next to us.  The ribeye was cooked perfectly - medium rare and had a nice charred crust and intense smokey flavor.  They cook it over wood which gives the food a nice smokey flavor.  The steak also had a sauce and it melted in my mouth.  The food was awesome!  Now, the service, it lacked a bit.  Our server was nice, but a little rough - she was older and had trouble going table to table.  She joked, but it was  a little much at times for a nicer place.  The service was really slow and she did not check in with us as much as she should have.  I am not one to complain, but it comes to a point when a server should check in and remember orders from tables of two.  The bus boys were on their game, kept the water flowing and picked up plates and brought out bread quickly.  The bread and butter are awesome too!  That's my two cents - go there for the food, but be patient because you may be waiting a bit."}
{"text":"Really great service and food. I was there for my anniversary dinner and really couldn't have asked for a better spot. I'd recommend the filet mignon, it was so delicious!"}
{"text":"Great meal! delicious fillet and rib eye.  We had a great experience and enjoyed meeting Lou who was helping us with our wine selection the night we were there.  We sat outside on the patio on a beautiful crescent moon evening, great atmosphere.  The inside dining is a little loud and sounded somewhat like a cafeteria so I am glad we chose to sit outside.  We visited 5/3/14 had Great Service and Great Food celebrating 30th Wedding Anniversary."}
{"text":"Getting better all the time! Litchfield's is the best on the West Side - maybe the only place you can go on a really \"special\" occasion without a long drive. Figure on $50 a person, without alcohol, so you can have an appetizer or dessert. We like all the entrees, and we visit every 6 weeks or so. The wood-fired chicken is especially tasty and very reasonably priced. Steaks are also great, and are priced similarly to the best steak houses downtown. It is getting to the point where you do need reservations on weekends, and they are closed Mondays and Tuesdays."}
{"text":"The service was great, atmosphere was great. That's where the two stars come from. Food was lacking. We got the cheese tray as a app. Seemed like if there was a display to show what they were serving that's the plate we got. The prosciutto was very fatty and had a clump of what I would say fatty grease in the middle. For entrees we got the halibut and NY strip steak. Both were cook great but just lacked flavor. Seemed as if there was no seasoning on the either. Strip was suppose to have a Demi glaze over it which couldn't tell at all. The middle of the steak was cool great which I asked for med/rare but the outside of it was charred to the point that it smelt burnt with every bite. I didn't even eat half of it. My dog loved it though! Got wild mushrooms with the steak. Again flavorless tossed in a pan with olive oil that's about it. I honesty felt like I asked for everything plain due to some diet restriction or something which of course I didn't. We also got asparagus as a side. Very strange the top layer was not bad at all but when you got to the bottom of the dish it was very gritty. Kinda like getting sand in your mouth. Normally I would have said something but since we already had a groupon I didn't. Just didn't want to look like the cheap ass coming in with coupons than complaining about the meal. It's to bad I was looking forward to it from other reviews. I hate to say this but since they are closed Monday and Tuesday's all I could think of is we were just getting the crap left over from the weekend."}
{"text":"Upscale restaurant on-site at the Wigwam. The hotel's location means that there are few full-service restaurants close by - so we chose to eat here. We were very glad we did!

Service is great - fast, friendly, and prompt. Food was terrific (ribeye for me).

Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Back to Litchfield's ( and we'll continue to come back...)
Excellent meal for 7 .. Entrees served fresh from the grill.  Had steaks, salmon, chicken, pasta .. All of it excellent.
Go there, now."}
{"text":"Great fine dining on the west side. Food is excellent. Ambiance and service was top notch."}
{"text":"We were there for my birthday dinner & it was wonderful.  We tried the pumpkin dumplings and they were delicious.  We had steaks that were excellent.  The kids enjoyed their meals as well. The staff was friendly and attentive without being annoying. We had our nightcap on the patio near the fire. Ricardo, the manager was on the ball & kept the staff at their best. Great for large groups or special occasions."}
{"text":"Always great food and service! Love to have date nights here and the ribeye is fantastic..."}
{"text":"Good food. A bit pricey but the atmosphere makes up for it. Service good. Very attentive wait staff. We have been there several times"}
{"text":"We've had great experiences both times we've been to dinner. Good food, service and ambiance!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! We went at 6pm on a Saturday night. We had made a reservation but there was absolutely no wait and they got us right in. Every single person at Litchfield's was incredibly nice. The food was amazing. I had the lamb and my Husband had a steak with mash potatoes. Both of our meals were wonderful. Litchfield's itself was a bit hard to find. We asked the Valet guys outside and they pointed us in the right direction. Also, it did take us 2 hours for dinner. Which wasn't a problem for us because we were there to relax and just talk and have fun. All in all I highly recommend Litchfield's....especially if you have a Groupon! :o)"}
