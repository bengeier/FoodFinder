{"text":"Great chicken! Seriously better than Raising Canes. The chicken is extremely tender and juicy, and the batter is delicate and crunchy.
Ya gotta try it!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp! and saw the great reviews; however, the chicken tenders were quite disappointing. The only reason I would say that is because the texture of the chicken itself is off. I felt like I was eating fried fish because the meat just dissolves in your mouth which is quite odd for chicken. The batter was light and fluffy which I enjoyed. The sweet potato fries were a mixture of undercooked and overcooked fries. The only solid thing was French fries and soda. I probably will not return, sorry!"}
{"text":"If you tried Cane's you must try these tenders! They are fresh tenders, moist and delicious, and the batter is to die for, twice the size of any others I've tried and prepared fresh to order. Their House Secret Sauce is amazing. It goes well with the tenders and their fresh cut fries too.
As I was staying at the Luxor Hotel, I went to the food court and I was immediately attracted to the rotating sign over the store. I love the roadside feeling of this place. Original vintage hub caps are part of the decor of the front counter, I even like the formed tin they are attached to, even the counter help wears uniforms that resemble mechanics of long ago. They offer great sides like mac and cheese, mashed potatoes and their okra nuggets are cooked to order. What steals the show talking about their sides, are the fresh cut fries. They serve them with every entree, they even have a jumbo serving of them that easily satisfied the four of us. We ordered both the sandwiches and the tenders and we were given a pager as we waited for the orders to be prepared. That was a real upscale touch with the pagers. About 8 minutes later our pager went off, and went to pick up the order everything looked amazing. The food is placed in heavy paper boats lined with paper, none of that foam stuff that other places offer. I asked for an extra cup for us to share our milkshakes, and guess what? It is hearth friendly compostable clear cup! Wow!
I love this place. I understand they have an other location at the Monte Carlo Hotel, but I have not been to that one. Certainly a place I want to visit for great tenders that won't break the bank. I will let the casinos do that."}
{"text":"Chicken strips were delicious. Probably the softest strips ever. & food was fresh. Down side is that they take awhile & a little pricey. Good thing they have military discount."}
{"text":"This chicken place is a breath of fresh air for a food court type of venue.  They make the chicken fresh to order.  The chicken was super soft. If you are a chicken strip fanatic this is a place to try! 

Side note: The service was alright. As you went up to them, you weren't really greeted with a smile but the food made up for it. 

They also had free refills on the lemonade which was a plus. It was a very refreshing drink for the hot Vegas summer ."}
{"text":"Excellent state fair tasting chicken tenders. The sauce is awesome!  Wish they were in Dallas. The prices are decent and the fries are good. Everything is cooked thoroughly."}
{"text":"I had trouble believing yelp, even looking right at the place, you'd think McD or something. 

Once you get the tenders though, completely different story, absolutely awesome! Crispy, homemade breading, fried to perfection. You don't find chicken tenders like these anywhere anymore.

I will admit, you have to laugh at yourself a little bit going into the Monte Carlo, past 5 high end restaurants and the buffet, but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Possibly the greasiest food I've had. And don't get me going on their shakes.  Skip this!"}
{"text":"The chicken tenders were good don't get me wrong but I wouldn't say that they were amazing. Let me break it down:

Pros:
-Chicken is freshly breaded and fried
-Hot and crisp chicken tenders
-Moist, juicy meat, not dry at all
-Friendly workers :)

Cons:
-A little pricy (3 pieces + fries is $7.95, 4 pieces is $8.95, and 5 pieces is $9.95)
-Fries weren't that well seasoned but were still crispy
-Location: Since it's in a food court deep inside of the Monte Carlo, the smoke smell is thick and might bother some while they're eating (but I mean you're in Vegas so...)

Overall, these chicken tenders are above average in taste and are sure to satisfy any cravings. I would return if I were craving chicken tenders. Up to par and better than some restaurants. Don't expect the fries to be that great though. The Original Chicken Tender is a top choice in the Monte Carlo food court."}
{"text":"This place was in the food court at our hotel in the MGM. One of the many places we had in the food court. How can you go wrong with chicken tenders? I ordered the 3 strip plate which came with a side. It usually comes with fries but I decided to swap those out with the mac and cheese. It added to the price, but I wasn't really feeling fries at the time.

The tenders were pretty good. Better than a lot of the ones I've had out there. The chicken was fresh, moist and tender. Where most get it wrong is in the breading. Some can be too hard and dense. The breading on these were great, not too soft or too hard, just right. Which makes chewing easier. The seasoning was good too, I hate when chicken tenders are too salty, but these were also in good proportion. The mac and cheese I got was good as a side and fulfilled my craving, just wish the portion was bigger for it.

Overall, a good choice for a quick bit to eat if you are nearby in the hotel."}
{"text":"I am from San Diego California and I wish their was a place like this in here. Every time I came to Las Vegas I eat at this awesome place I love their tenders the taste the flavor. Also the service well this time I went I got a rude cashier by the name of Alexandra or something like that, but when I got my food serve a friendly lady she as awesome I ask for different sauces and with a big smile she provided to me and also had a great attitude I think she had an awesome name too...Osiris...
I just wanted to write this because is a great fast food place to go to in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"You know how they say when you go to a restaurant you're unfamiliar with, order chicken tenders because its difficult to mess them up. Well, this place takes the cake on that one. The WORST chicken tenders I ever had in my life. Thought it was just me, had a few others in my group taste them and we all agreed - no flavor at all. It was just batter and chicken. And some parts of the batter was so thick, that I thought I was biting into chicken but nope - batter. Fries were cooked too long and also flavorless. They're skinny/shoestring fries and should not have cooked as long as they did. Even the sauce that came with it couldn't save it. Save your money, the food here sucks. Unless you crave bland food I would definitely pass this place. Go to Nathans instead."}
{"text":"I did a quick search of the food available at the food court at the Monte Carlo and this one caught my eye. Chicken fingers. I can do that for lunch today. So on my break, I took the short walk over and ordered the meal that included 3 tenders and fries.

The breading on the chicken tenders is tasty, a little bit sweet. But it's not as crunchy as I would like. The chicken though is super moist and tender. It also comes with a huge basket of fries, the type made from freshly cut potatoes with the skin still on. Their special sauce (dare I say?) reminds me of Raising Canes' sauce: nice and peppery.

Overall, this is a solid place to turn to at the food court when you're looking for freshly fried chicken tenders. They also sell Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs and beer."}
{"text":"Food met what we were expecting (fast, easy, and good).  Good customer service."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. Texas toast sandwich with sweet potato fries. Delicious. The woman at the counter was super nice too. Def will come back."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Luxor and I heard of this place supposed to be really good, it was Saturday night and around 11 pm I called the front desk asking if this place had a time they closed and the lady checked and said they close at 1am so I thought that's fine gives me time to rest in my room. Around 12am I got up and went to go here, got to the place and they were closing up already. No big deal thought I'll start tomorrow again, well now it's Sunday I come down check out it's 11am I go near this place again and they shoo you away shouting WE'RE CLOSE OPEN IN 5 MINUTES! I was like okay calm down I'll wait, so my boyfriend and I go to Johnny Rockets for his food we order and wait for about longer than 8 minutes and I was like okay I'll go back over to the other place walk back up they again shoo me away and yell WE'RE CLOSE GIVE US 15 MINUTES ! I was like this is rediculous I'm not going to come here they obviously don't want to serve people today."}
{"text":"Freshly deep fried chicken tenders, delicious crispy just-right fries, creamy ranch dressing with their own fry sauce. $12 & change, not bad at all for a casino. Loved it! Will eat here again when returning for Def Leppard on June 17th."}
{"text":"Honestly, this is probably the best Chicken Tenders I've ever had... they're so fresh and tasty. They're fried perfectly and have a crunchy but soft batter - if that makes sense! 
They're located inside the MGM Grand Food Court. It closes at midnight so you can't utilize this spot for late night drunk munchies (bummer!) Price is expensive, but so is everywhere else in Vegas...
TIP: There are coupons on every single tray in the foodcourt, pick them up and save money here. I believe it's a 50% off and a discounted milkshake."}
{"text":"Came here just before midnight in a Friday and they had a huge line. As they close at midnight, maybe 10 before midnight they said that only those in line would be served and that the line effectively ended after the last person as of right then. So don't be late!

We really enjoyed these freshly fried, lightly breaded tender chicken strips. We watched the guy freshly breaking them and putting them in the fryer as ppl ordered. The sauce they came with was decent and they also have ranch and bbq if you ask. The fries seemed fresh as well. 

Solid, reasonable priced quick dinner/snack when you've been drinking all day! We will definitely be back! (This is in a food court area)"}
{"text":"I love this place! My cousin referred me to this spot! Honestly next to chick a fila this is definitely my fave spot to eat chicken. I love how they don't put too much batter on the chicken! It's not hard and crunchy unlike most chicken strips I've tried, it's perfect lol. It's like really moist when u bite into it and the strips are pretty big. Also I tried the bacon cheddar fries they're actually the best I've had lol. Too bad they don't have this spot in California I would totally go there a lot if we did lol. I also tried my sisters chilli fries they're pretty good too."}
{"text":"One of the few spots in Vegas where I ended up spending less than $10.00 for a solid meal.  It's located inside the Luxor Hotel at the food court.  Whether you're looking for a quick bite, or something to soak up all the alcohol you had earlier the Original Chicken Tender is a great option! I ordered the combo which was a 3 piece with fries and was pleased with my meal.  It wasn't too heavy, not that much grease, and the sauce that comes with it is what makes the experience great.  I don't recall what sauce it was exactly kind of reminded me of a ketchup and mayo mix but with something else too.  As for the fries... they're just regular fries nothing really too special about them.  The service here is really fast and perfect for a quick bite if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"I was in need of a quick meal after a long day and there as aass a food court inside MGM where I was staying.  

I'm not sure this place is a franchise since I have never seen this name before.  The cashier who took order was nice.  But the food took over 10min when they had no customer before me lol. How? I don't know.  

Their chicken was soft, and nicely cooked, just what you expect from chicken tenders.  Surprisingly their fries were really good as well.  My co-worker ordered sweet potato fries and those were delicious too.  The dipping sauce they use  is a must! 

Is the price expensive as people say?  Hmm yes and no.  I mean I live in Hawaii so I didn't really find it that bad, and my 9 dollar 3 pieces chicken tenders and fries did fill me up.  I think maybe if the price includes a drink then would be perfect.  4 dollars for a bottle of water is way too much."}
{"text":"We just got back from Vegas and we didn't just eat at The Original chicken tender place once. We ate there THREE times. Best chicken tenders EVER. Made to order, juicy, just the right crispy. The sauce is the BOMB! I would absolutely recommend this place and wish we had one in my town. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Seriously delicious chicken tenders made fresh.

I was thrilled to find what I at first thought was a Dairy Queen. Wrong resort.... that would have been at the Excalibur or one resort over from Luxor.

I really enjoyed the crispy and delicious the chicken tenders were. And how large, hot, and non greasy they were.

Since I was on vacation I did not quibble about prices that were slightly above average.... but this was a food court. Just having the option to order and enjoy fried okra what I special treat. 

I would have been satisfied with the regular dipping sauce, but order their gravy at an extra cost. it was the only thing that had a processed taste... but I still ate some of it.

I did use my coupon from Luxor for a free soda pop, with unlimited refills.

the total bill was about $13.00, but this was for a lot of food, looking at a food court. and don't let the word food court fool you. This one was massive and clean and food courts are where most people in Las Vegas high end LUXURY resorts can eat at anyway. 

I will be back in February and will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Not bad for fried chicken strips in a small food court. Their chicken tenders are HEAVILY battered but it is extremely crispy and fried very well! The prices are not too high (around 8 dollars for 3 pieces with fries) considering everything else in the food court was really overpriced. Overall, i thought they were okay!"}
{"text":"I saw some haterade posts so I just had to set it straight.  This place has the best darn chicken tenders I have ever had.  They friggin batter it in front of you.  So all the haters need to relax, this is a solid place.  Especially for those that need that hangover remedy!  #realtalk"}
{"text":"Absolutely the complete best chicken tenders I have ever gotten. They look like the pictures they post online. There fries are thin, but crispy. I just can not believe how good these were. My husband tried them first while I was getting napkins and he was completely shocked as well. This is something worth trying and coming back too!!"}
{"text":"Loved their crispy chicken tenders, fried okra, and sauce. One of the better places in the food court! Great stop for a quick meal :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Better than Raising Canes in all aspects. The batter, the sauce, the fries; All great!!!!

In addition, the Assistant Manager, Tanay is on her P's and Q's. She knows her job and it is obvious that she likes it. Seems as though she works every shift though. She should be promoted!!!"}
{"text":"Everything was fresh and cooked to order. And THANK YOU for being a chicken strip place that isn't scared to leave em in the fryer for a little bit to get extra crispy! The fries were great too, not too much salt & also cooked to order. You can get a 3 tender meal with fries for under $10 so it's a clutch lunch spot or for a late night snack."}
{"text":"I was honestly pretty excited to try this place out but I guess it wasn't worth the hype. I ordered the 3 piece meal. It comes with 3 pieces of tenders and some fries. I added a side of mac&cheese to it as well.

Chicken: I've had better. It is of decent size and the batter is different but after a while, i felt like it was just too much batter.

Fries: disgustingly old and soggy.

Mac&Cheese: its okay, i tasted powder when i ate it, i'm not too sure how to describe it but eh it was just okay.

I did have a favorite though; it was the Arnold Palmer. OH MY GOODNESS, so good and refreshing."}
{"text":"Would of never thought eating this at the food court would be so good. Most delicious chicken tenders!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Vegas I have to have these. They're the softest chicken tenders and most delicious I have ever had. It's what my friends and I look forward to when planning a trip to Vegas ! They are not frozen. They bread them right in front of you, that's why they're so fresh"}
{"text":"I woke up hungover and was craving chicken tenders..the tenders were hand breaded and fried in front of me.  The fries were also dropped on the spot so everything was fresh.  Overall I was unimpressed, the breading on the chicken tenders didn't really stick to the chicken very well and the fries were pretty crunchy.  The flavor was just not there either, pretty bland. $15 for 3 tenders fries and a mug root beer, should have just put it all on black."}
{"text":"Awful. Management should be ashamed. They cannot put mustard on the dog in the restaurant which nullifies the entire hot dog eating experience. Means they put the sauerkraut on them you have to put the mustard on top if you want it. Only alternative is for them to give you the kraut on the side.

Really.... Is this a legit hot dog stand?"}
{"text":"Eating in a casino can get expensive if you eat in the signature spots the entire time so places like Original Chicken Tender comes in handy for that little snack. The snack in particular are the two Nathan's Famous hot dogs that you can get when you don't want to pay $24 for the standard buffet. I got them for $6 and they came with a cup of fries. You'll have to prepare the condiments yourself from packets but it's still better than overpaying for the casino restaurants."}
{"text":"The morning make your own Omelette Bar was a money saver and a very worthy breakfast. It was $9.95 and included toast and average potatoes. The best part is that you pick any ingredients and they cook it up right in front of you for that same price. Mine included three toppings and they took the extra time to make it well done as well. This might be the best breakfast among the three hotels. All the buffets are low rated, other places have lines, but this was good enough for budget travelers."}
{"text":"Customer service wasn't so bad but the chicken is AWFUL... For $13 I got over salted tenders with the batter that just falls off the meat and the chicken meat is slimy and not to mention how disgusting it is to be served ranch that's house made at room temperature from the counter in solo brand sauce containers... I would have argued that my 5 piece was really a 4 piece and that I was shorted but I considered myself lucky because we could barely finish 1 tender let alone finish 5... long line and a job to get back to prevented me from asking for a refund.. oh well, never again. HIGHLY DONT RECOMMEND
I will go completely out of my way to blue ribbon friend chicken at the grand bazaar shops or even leave and get Raising canes just to never have to eat this again..."}
{"text":"Wow. Grabbed a quick bite here after a long afternoon of gambling, and I was pleasantly surprised! These were not your average chicken strips. The service was extremely fast, and the batter was light and airy and crispy. The texture was unlike any fried chicken tenders I've had before. The sauce they came with had good flavor. This is a great place to get a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to eat if you're in a hurry and want something quick from the food court! This place is located on the second floor mezzanine in the Luxor hotel and casino. I ordered the 3 piece chicken tenders with fries and sauce. The chicken is crispy and heavily battered but the fries are delicious! Only rating it 3 stars because I've had better chicken tender and fries and the prices seem to have gone up. My meal costs $10."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, their chicken tenders are perfect every time. The service is always good and their fries are pretty good too! Always fresh."}
{"text":"My girlfriend talked about this being the most amazing place to get chicken strips, she looked forward to coming here for years since she has tried them. I believe she was mildly disappointed with her second interaction with this place. The strips were better than your general run of the mill chicken strips, they just weren't the life altering moment she was looking for. I'd say they were in my top three though that I've tried, so if you're definitely craving some chicken, i'd say this will definitely hit the spot.  If you came here drunk and remembered this as being the best place ever, maybe nostalgia got the best of you."}
{"text":"I have to come here everytime i go down to the strip lol me and my friends love this place. Definatly addicted, very good simply made food."}
{"text":"Holy cow (or chicken) these are the best tenders I've ever had! Super light and crispy coating. Awesome sweet potato fries. Coming back for chicken and waffles!"}
{"text":"Saw some decent reviews for this place and since I love Raising Cane's but was staying at the MGM Grand, figured I'd try OCT.  Well, it was a bit of a disappointment.  The chicken was way overdone and dried out. The sauce was not special and tangy enough for my tastes and the fries were pitiful and soggy.  Terrible experience so the next day I took a cab to Raising Canes and that hit the spot."}
{"text":"It's hard to find cheap decent fast food along the strip. The Orignial Chicken Tender is together with Nathan's (hot dog) at the food court of Monte Carlo Hotel is a good option. 

We needed a quick bite to maintain our schedule while walking around the casino. 
I ordered the chicken tenders and fries combo along with lemonade.  The food was made to order. Nice, tender, and with a crispy exterior. Great for soaking in the alcohol after a long night. Fries were freshly cut and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"My goodness, who ever thought the best thing I have will taste in Vegas would be found in a hotel's simple food court. Totally didn't expect anything, was just hungry and decided to grab a quick bite and my oh my, that chicken tender got me sprung.

I bit into a piece of white meat delicious-ness that was perfectly juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside and was so fresh, it was about to burn my tongue out of my mouth. Yes, I did discover that this \"fast food\" joint FRESHLY makes their chicken. I witnessed the cook pulling out the chicken tenders to flour them in breadcrumbs and then deep fried them. It took a little longer than your standard Mcdonald's fast food speed, but 12 minutes is worth it. Shoot, I can't even start on how their house sauce that comes with their chicken tenders makes me want to have all chicken tenders in the world have a mandatory marriage to that sauce. 

I believe 2 chicken tenders are about 5 bucks, just get one of the combo meals. You can upgrade the side to sweet potato fries for a buck more if you wanted. I think this chain is just a Vegas thing, the one we discovered was located in the Luxor hotel. We have found our \"must go to place to eat in Vegas\". Funniest thing ever because 40 dollars buffet, not impressed, but this, YES."}
{"text":"This is a really good chicken fast food place inside the Luxor food court. I believe the tenders are made to order and not frozen like McDonald's. At least they taste like it! They serve delicious chicken and fries served with unique dipping sauces. I have been here many times and will definitely go back!!!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My hubby has been raving about these chicken tenders for a while now, so knowing that I HATE chicken because of all my bad experiences-with the chicken tasting like rubber and just grossing me out... I have to say that these are the freshest, most delicious chicken tenders I've ever tasted! 

Wtf! They have the batter on the side ready to make your own fresh chicken tenders. They serve them to you super hot, perfectly cooked, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. 

The fries were perfectly salted and the sides of BBQ sauce and Honey Mustard are so good. 

Delish! 

We ate them at the food court which is also a reason why they were so fresh."}
{"text":"Semi-quick restaurant with good tasting chicken tenders located at the Luxor food court. 

I ordered a 3 finger meal with fries and a water. Food took about 10 minutes to get out to me. The food was better than I expected. I really enjoyed the fries. That is what was first to go on my plate. 

The meal filled me up and satisfied! 3.5/5 STARS for me."}
{"text":"I was walking around the Luxor looking for food and I came across this place and thought I would give it a shot. The prices are high, which I expected being on the Strip in a Casino. But the food was amazing. The chicken was perfectly crispy without being oily at all. The chicken seemed to be good quality and the fries were good also. My only complaint is it took a while for the food the come out. When I ordered only one lady was working behind the counter so she had to get everyones orders, drinks and then get the food cooking. Besides the longer wait the food was great. I will be back the next time I am in the Luxor."}
{"text":"The service isn't great, and the wait times are long, but these are literally the best chicken tenders I've ever tasted. Mind = blown. The taste trumps everything, so I'm giving them a coveted five-star review. Deal with it."}
{"text":"One the best and juiciest chicken tenders that I have had. 

I ordered the 4 piece for about $7. It comes witch fries and their social sauce they give. Doesn't seem like they charge extra as I asked for 2 more. 

The chicken tenders were very very juicy and very delicious. So much that when you buy into it, juices would come out. The French fries were not bad, nothing close to McDonald's but still pretty good."}
{"text":"love salty crispy chicken but this one was super salty. inedibly salty. maybe we caught a bad batch. sweet potato fries tasted like it was dipped in maple syrup prior to frying?!#!??"}
{"text":"I stayed at the Luxor over the weekend for my girlfriends DirtyThirty celebration! Short on time with a jam packed schedule going out for food wasn't terribly important. Luxor like all of the hotels in Vegas offer a food court of sorts. 

There were several options of course. Pizza, hotdogs, subs, and burgers. Being a sucker for chicken tenders I had made up my mind. I ordered the meal that came with 3 tenders and accompanied with a cup of french fries. 

There was a short wait but all for good reason. Their tenders are made fresh. They are battered and fried shortly after you place your order. None of that frozen shit. They were so nice and light, super soft too! Yes, that is a thing with fresh chicken. It also came with this sauce, surely made in house, didn't come in a packet. Sooooooooo good! I had to get another one! Also, with much excitement, after eating 3 tenders I noticed I still had one in my basket! BONUS! Made my freaking night! I tell you what, I was a happy camper and member of the clean plate club. 

Their chicken tenders are so good. We decided to get another order to share while we were getting ready for our show the next night. I need some of that goodness right now. What am I forgetting....hmmmmm, yeah, the service was good too. You probably want to know that huh? Just go get some chicken from the Original Chicken Tender at the Luxor food court, it will stay on your mind, for quite some time. It's still on mine. Haunting me. With it's deliciousness. Hmmmmmm."}
{"text":"Needed something quick and fast after a show and I picked this place. It was pretty solid. I got 3 chicken tenders, mashed potatoes, and a biscuit. The chicken tenders weren't greasy and the batter was buttermilk and crispy. Potatoes were tasty, but the biscuit was dry. The lemonade was delicious. My mom's fries felt like an after thought (limp, eh) but overall, pretty satisfied!"}
{"text":"2.5 Stars, but rounding down because everything other than the chicken was a complete fail. 

I ordered the 3 piece meal, which comes with fries for $8. Swapping out fries for mashed potatoes cost an extra $1.  I added a big biscuit for $1.50. Yeah Chris Rock said it... Big A$$ Biscuit!!! We up to $11.50 for 3 Chicken Tenders, mashed potatoes, biscuit and tax. 

Biscuit - MC Gusto ain't got nothing on Denise Austin, because these biscuits were hard a$$... Buns of Steel! I bit in and thought my tooth broke off. Hard on the inside, hard on the outside, like my arteries.  Yea, I got jokes today. So sad, because I was so drooling when the guy brought out the paint brush and started basting the biscuit with a little butter before wrapping it up. I didn't eat another bite, I threw it away. And they didn't give me butter or honey.

Chicken Tenders - The tenders are pretty good. I don't know if they are $4.95 for two pieces good (while in Vegas, you pay Strip prices), but they were good. Definitely $4.95 for three pieces good. One problem is that the breading was already falling off before I even tried to pick one up. It's light and crispy, but the falling off thing is an issue. The original thousand island based sauce (it's like a chipotle thousand island dip) is money, while the bbq sauce is not.  

Mashed Potatoes - If you're charging me an extra $1 for mashed potatoes over fries and you forget to put gravy on the potatoes or on the side, I am gonna be pissed. I didn't find out until I got back to my room and I wasn't about to walk another 500 steps back for them to fix it.  

Maybe things sucked because I ordered after 10 p.m. (they are open until midnight every night, so no excuses!). At these prices, they need to get things right.  

Original Chicken Tender is located in the 2nd level food court by the upstairs sphinx."}
{"text":"WHOA! this place surprised me more than seeing the real Elvis on the Strip.  Dont be fooled by its location inside the Luxor's food court this place is legit.  Fresh chicken dipped and battered in the store.  Texas toast chicken sandwiches.. aaah, check.  The chicken tender sandwhich was one of the best flavorful sandwiches i have ever had, the fries are awsome as well.  I took my food up to my room and the cleaning lady was cleaning my room or else I would have ate it sooner!!! LOL!"}
{"text":"Might be the best chicken tenders I've ever had. If you're in or around Luxor, it's a must to try this chicken. Juicy and flaky, done just right!"}
{"text":"GOOD CHICKEN TENDERS and FRIES!!! 

Grabbed a quick bite to eat before The Blue Man Group. Located inside the Monte Carlo food court. I've had their chicken tenders before and liked them a lot. I had to have them again. 

I had  3 PIECE CHICKEN TENDERS with FRIES $7.00 and original sauce on the side. Chicken tenders were perfect in my book. Crunchy coating and meat was moist and tender. It taste even better dipped in their house-made original sauce. The fries were also perfect. It taste like it's double fried because it's crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. 

El Hubby had their PHILLY SANDWICH $9. It had thinly sliced beef, mushrooms and onions. He really liked it.

Staff were very nice and friendly. They made small talk and thanked us for coming. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've had a lot of chicken tenders in my days and these by far are the best ones. Each bite will literally melt in your mouth. The fiancé & I always come here whenever we have a Groupon. For less than $20 dollars with the groupon you get 6 chicken tenders two large fries two pieces of Texas toast and two large drinks two coleslaws. Not bad considering the total for that would be $32 plus tax. Everything taste amazing I highly recommend this place & check out Groupon to get you a good deal for less."}
{"text":"If staying at or near Luxor, and looking for cheap eats, this chicken tender spot is not bad.   If you are a local though, this food has nothing on Cane's.  At canes, for cheaper, you get 6 strips of chicken, fries, coleslaw, and texas toast.

For $9.95 here at Original Chicken Tender, you get five freshly/generously breaded chicken cooked to yummy juicy delicious perfection and a side of skinny fries.  But that's it.  Their dipping sauce is similar to Cane's (probably some kind mix of mayo, ketchup, worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper).  I noticed though when you dip the chicken, sometimes the breading falls off.  

Still, besides McDonalds, this is probably the cheapest good food you'd get in the area."}
{"text":"I ordered the 5pc with fries. I liked the batter but it would've been better if they added some season  to it might have taste better. The sweet was good but not to sweet."}
{"text":"It wasn't the worse sausage biscuit I've ever had, it wasn't all that fulling either.. I would have gladly chose McDee's over this place again.... Eh... that  is all."}
{"text":"Our group needed a quick lunch between conferences and the lines were crazy long for all of the fast food stops. We decided to all get the chicken tenders, and to ours surprise it was really fast with less than a five minute wait time. They definitely got their name correct for this place. They have the most tender chicken. We all felt like it was worth eating once since there's so many choices of places to eat here, you really don't want to eat at the same place twice!"}
{"text":"After reading some reviews of this food court gem, I had to try it. You were right, the chicken tenders were amazing, not sure how to describe how crispy they were and how tender...the sweet potatoes fries were excellent too and the sauce was yummy! Even the lemonade wasn't too tart or too sweet. For 11.95 I got three large tenders, a large lemonade and two regular orders of sweet potato fries which were large size to me. It's located right near the casino inside the Luxor."}
{"text":"I waited 20 minutes for my food before deciding that it was taking too long for an order of 4 pieces of chicken tenders and fries. When I approached the counter the person who took my order was no longer  there. Alejandra however was there and she was very helpful. It seemed to just be a mix up . Thankfully she had a great attitude and was very helpful.  Due to her great customer service and communication skills I am willing to give this place another try while staying at the luxor."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I don't know if I was really starving or what. These chicken tenders they serve up are super moist and yummy. Too bad there's no honey to dip the tenders in. The fries were a bit limp but for mall like food, I had a decent meal. After I ordered, I noticed the food tray had a bogo 50% off coupon on the placemat. Oh well. I will save my coupon for the next visit when I'm rushing to watch a show and need to grab a quick bite again."}
{"text":"This location sells both chicken tenders and Nathan's hotdogs. We got a combo to split that included (2) Nathan's hotdogs and an order of fries. It was a nice snack to hold us over until dinner. Definitely a little pricy at almost $11. (Another Yelper said he paid $6 for the same combo- no idea what he is talking about.) Despite the cost, the dogs and fries were delish!"}
{"text":"I wanted something fast but not \"fast food\", while at the food court in the Monte Carlo. I had the 3 strips and fries. Most moist, tender chicken I have ever had at a fast food joint. I was so pleasantly surprised. We were staying at the M/C so I knew I would be back the next day. They make them to order, so it takes a few extra minuets compared to McD's just next door. They do not charge for Ranch or Blue cheese - another pleasantl surprise there too. I tried their Nathan's Chili Cheese Dog the next day. I wished I would have stuck to the strips, It was just okay (took a star away for that). I wouldn't describe the chicken as \"crispy\" so much - but you could tell it was freshly battered, freshly cooked, and it was tasty w/out any sauce or extras. I dipped mine in hot sauce and ranch (must ask - but no charge)."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Chicken was fresh but bland. Not a hint of seasoning, fries were good though. Staff was very nice."}
{"text":"Friday May 19th around 7 PM.

Johnny Rockets next door doesn't have chili cheese fries because it's an express location, not what I thought it was.  I went here and saw the Philly Cheesesteaks are $14!   I decided to order a regular fry and top it with chilli and cheese.  I needed a quick dinner before Cher's concert tonight.  Food was hot but wasn't happy they added two little scoops of chilli, that was a $2 upcharge.  I asked for another scoop because it was all cheese.


Great quick spot to bite."}
{"text":"Original Chicken Tender was good but nothing great! I guess some people do really like them however to me it's your typical over priced food court inside of a casino! Nothing special! I was extremely hungry one night after gambling and we decided to head over to try this place out. They also in addition to this have these \"famous\" hot dogs that they offer. And again there, it really was no excitement behind the hot dog I had. I guess if you are hungry and craving some chicken strips and or hot dogs come here?"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!!! I bought a groupon for $20 for 4 chicken strip meals. I figured it would be a cheap meal while in Vegas and wasn't expecting much. When I realized it was in a food court, my expectations went down even more.  I was so surprised at the quality of food we received. The chicken strips were the best we have ever had, and we a lot of chicken strips! They were juicy and tender on the inside and crispy on the outside, and the sauce that came with them....DELICIOUS!! Each meal came with 3 chicken tenders, fries, a fluffy piece of Texas toast, and a drink and it worked out to $5 each with our Groupon. It was the only meal we had that we felt like we didn't get hosed and actually got an amazing deal. We will definitely be going back the next time we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Literally, this is the saltiest chicken tenders I've ever tasted. Total waste of money. I literally had to down a bottle of water. It just tasted like I was eating salt packets. I thought it was just the breaking so I took it off but it's the chicken that's salty as well. Never again and FYI I'm not drunk."}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise, hand battered and prepared chicken tenders made to order.  Best place on the strip for convenient, reasonably priced food."}
{"text":"Man, I gotta say, I was really impressed with how good the chicken strips are here! The dipping sauce they give you is amazing too. They take a while to freshly-cook your meal, but it comes out piping hot and tastes great. MUCH BETTER THAN EATING AT THE BUFFET where the food has been sitting for an hour...ick. I went back the next day for more. Seriously - they have it down to a science - the flavor/seasoning in the batter is great, the portion size is impressive for the Strip (everything's expensive here), and the sweet potato fries kick a$$ too. Highly recommended for the freshly-cooked, good quality chicken. Worth the 10 minute wait, for SURE."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Why the Monte Carlo  has such a poor quality place in its food court. Elvira is so slow moving and bad attitude."}
{"text":"When you're on the strip finding decent, cheap food isn't always easy to come by. And although I wouldn't exactly classify the food here as cheap, per se, it's definitely one of the cheaper options you'll find in the area. Ordered the 5 strip meal cuz I was hangry! Honestly, I wasn't expecting much. But I was pleasantly surprised. The chicken strips we juicy and the breading was light and crispity crunchity! They were definitely tasty. The sweet potato fries, while not very greasy to me, were actually greasier than the chicken strips. As for flavor, they were ok. Their lemonade was good, too! So if you're in the Luxor area, tired of the buffets, just want something quick and \"relatively cheap\" then this is a good place to stop."}
{"text":"Ordered the original chicken burger. It was greasy and not delicious. Would not eat again"}
{"text":"LOOORRRRDDDDD. How? How can these chicken tenders be so magical? Once you eat these, you won't ever go back, no other chicken tender can compare. It's light (which is weird for fried foods), crispy, moist, and the sauce, I don't know what the sauce is, but it's amazing! The perfect combination. It really is that good, don't trust me? Try it for yourself and you'll be amazed too! 

Every day after I got this, I craved it again and again, and until this day, I still want it *crying internally* I'll be back for you!! hahaha 

PRICE: affordable and reasonable 

SERVICE: quick and the workers are very nice 

*I went to the one at Luxor (which I believe is where the 1st one opened in Vegas). They're also located at Monte Carlo & MGM, but I can't speak much for how good they are there."}
{"text":"The omelettes are good and you can choose what you want to have on them - or with them (bacon or sausage). Quick delivery. However don't bother ordering the overpriced orange juice. It's just a diluted fruit drink concentrate. The coffee is...eh...American, that is more like coffee flavored tea if you're from Europe."}
{"text":"Worst chicken fingers EVER!  I was starving after a day of hiking in Zion National Park in Utah and I still couldn't finish them. You know they have to be bad if a practically starving person who skipped breakfast and skipped lunch and then hiked all day couldn't finish them. Instead of breading around the chicken, it's more like a thick. greasy batter (like what you would expect with fish & chips).  So gross & disgusting!  They look big but when you bite into them you can see it's there's hardly any chicken in them - they're just puffed out due to all that batter. It's another Vegas con job!  The fries are nothing to write home about either (flavorless McDonalds copies) but at least they weren't gross.  They were edible.  But those fingers are so gross I just can't believe a franchise was created with those things as a base.    Never again!  Do yourselves a favor and pick ANY other place in the Luxor food court even if you have to pay a few dollars extra.  Your stomach will thank you for it."}
{"text":"Had the chicken tender burger and it tasted pretty good with their special sauce. The service was slow, and the diarrhea and abdominal pain that followed were not worth it."}
{"text":"Serving both Nathan's hot dogs and chicken tenders, I prefer just to get the hot dogs since they're advertised bigger. You can upgrade to sweet potato fries for an additional fee. Every item they have served is tasty as far as food court food goes.

It's pretty expensive compared to other places in terms of how much one gets for the money they pay, though, so I rarely eat here when I go to the food court except when I feel like eating a hot dog. The food is served very quickly and they provide a vibrating pager when one's food is done."}
{"text":"I needed a quick bite to eat in the morning, so I dropped by here. This is located in the food court downstairs of Monte Carlo. Their chili cheese dog was good!! Even though I ordered it and let it sit til it was cold (because I had something to do), it still tasted good. Roughly 10 bucks for a dog and fries."}
{"text":"For food court fare, the Original Chicken Tender is a great choice. Straightforward menu, freshly-made food, and plenty of space to sit and enjoy your meal.

Compared to the local staple of Raising Cane's, the superior chicken is debatable. Only way to find out is to try for yourself!"}
{"text":"3.5 I'd say. Simple, quick food. Oil is taken care of as needed. Good for what it is in comparison to some other options close by.

So this place won't wow you, it is a lot of carbs and a lot of fried food. Looking at the options in the pictures I had hope there were veggies available but that isn't the case. We had gotten a chicken tender platter and texas toast sammich.

The fries were good, cole slaw is what you expect. The texas toast isn't as crispy as I'd want it to be honestly though, for the sammich or as an addition to the platter either. The chicken tenders are cooked well and still maintain a decent amount of crunch once you get into them."}
{"text":"Chose here as my late night dinner after watching KA. the chicken strips were so soft and yep crispy and tasty at the same time, the fries were average to good. The sauce was also good too."}
{"text":"The absolute best chicken tenders you can find anywhere. What a surprise in a food court. They cook them to order so they're fresh and hot when you get them, and the flavor is incredible. Perfectly cooked and tender!"}
{"text":"Checked into our hotel and we were starving. Sent the husband to grab something and he stumbled on this spot. Ordered the chicken fingers and the chicken finger sandwich. AMAZING!!!!!!!! Chicken was moist and a perfect crisp!!!! Sauce was good. Fries were good. Bread was soft on the chicken sandwich. Food was great. Went again the next day for the chicken strips!"}
{"text":"Food was very tasty and their own signature sauce was great. Chicken was very filling. 2 small kids had a 3 piece tender each and I had a 5 piece and could not finish it. The homemade fries were also very good. Would Definitley eat there again for a quick meal and I am back at the Luxor hotel"}
{"text":"Wanna do Vegas on a budget? Either hit me up or hit up the food courts.

Ate here on our group's first night in Vegas. It's quick, cheap and filling. OG Chicken Tenderz also seemed to be the best option amongst the others in the Monte Carlo food court (Subway, Rubio's, Sbarro... meh).

I got the chili cheese dog, which came with a side of yummy fries. The dog was loaded with toppings so a lot slid off, which was okay with me. A couple people in our group got a basket of chicken tenders... and the breaded part pretty much fell off of everyone's chicken. Food was oily as fuuuuu but it was good for it's price and provides fuel for a night of drinking."}
{"text":"This place sucks I had 50% off a 7 dollar milk shake but we ordered it 2 min later so it was to different receipts from the main meal so they wouldn't allow it. It is ok now because the manager met with us and discussed the problem"}
{"text":"I ate here last night for dinner since I needed a quick meal and this place was perfect. The chicken was amazing, it was tender and fried perfectly in a light batter. The fries were okay, just normal fries. I would definitely return for the chicken and amazing fry sauce, but I'll skip the fries next time. 

Service was quick and friendly for a food court. I think this place has much better chicken than Raising Cane's, and better fry sauce too. 

Bonus, I ordered a 3 piece, but got 4 pieces. *your experience may vary."}
{"text":"I've been in Las Vegas my whole life and just recently I've had the urge to go and try food that is located on the strip. Now to a local from the West Side, going all the way down to the strip for chicken tenders may seem a little overkill. However, these tenders taste great. They have an original flavor that you can't really compare with other locations. Now the strip is know for having higher prices than it should and that's also the case here unfortunately. I got the 3 tender platter for $15. I will definitely be returning but the price makes it a once in a while thing."}
{"text":"My favorite place on the strip to get a super tasty casual meal! This place is a MUST every time I come to Vegas. It's something about the batter... it's crispy but light and the chicken is always moist.  The best chicken tenders Ive literally ever had they are perfection!!!"}
{"text":"The original tender sandwich (10.95), which includes a small side order of fries* is two strips of chicken. Two (2). Dos (2). It is snack level of chicken for 10$, and it is not even that good.

*upgradable to sweet potato for additional 1$

I don't even know why I came back after the initial patronage brought me face-to-face with the smallest 10$ chicken sandwich outside of airports, amusement parks, stadiums, or fucking Michelin-starred establishments. I mean, honestly ... Popeye's is just one property over in Excalibur's food court, and I think their po' boys have more chicken in them, and at a third of the price. The chicken is actually much better at Popeye's as well.

What other complaints do I have? They provide you with a single miniature ration of dipping sauce even when buying the biggest meal. Come on, player! Not even Cane's is that stingy.

What do they do well? Nothing. Although, begrudgingly, I must applaud their effort to offer 25% off discount for civil servants. (See tip.)  

Every time I return, I feel like kicking myself in the nuts afterward. I must be some kind of sadist, not much unlike that one entrepreneur farther north on the strip running a kick me in the balls LLC."}
{"text":"Wow. In love at first bite! Crunch, crispy & delicious! Just get it! Chicken tenders are the bomb! $5+ for 3 pieces of chicken tenders only. Worth it! I must say, I came during lunch time and the wait was pretty long. Try to come during non-traffic hours."}
{"text":"Greasy, overcooked chicken tenders and soggy sweet potato fries, served with a side of bEtchy employee who gave me a bag when I asked for a to-go container, saying that was all they had and I could take it or leave it.  Such a waste of money!!"}
{"text":"For the price and convenience, this is a solid choice. The tenders have a crunchy exterior and the sauce pairs with it well. The coleslaw is sweet and a tad bit overdressed but it's fast food so you can't complain too much. The toast is a classic choice, however, it desperately needs butter and garlic. Overall, if you're drunk or hungry, then you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Food was great and the price was good. Best of all, Carmen's service was excellent. She made sure our order was correct and applied eligible discounts without asking. She handled our extra requests efficiently and correctly. Carmen was super!!"}
{"text":"Showed up around 9:30pm.. there was a specific item I asked for on the menu which I was politely told they were not serving it.. after kindly joking around about how I've been all over trying to get this certain dish, Jay the young cook from the back overheard my anguish and simply cooked it up for me special! That is customer service. The chicken is AMAZING, tender and moist with a very light breading...A MUST STOP FOR ANY FOODIE OUT THERE! Thanks again Jay...You da Man Brotha!"}
{"text":"I just wanna start by saying I'm a 5 year old with my eating habits. Chicken strips/nuggets are probably my favorite food. I'm from the Phoenix area where chicken is abundant and delicious but this place blows any chicken I've ever had out of the water. The customer service was amazing. Our food was done within seconds of ordering. I might eat here again before I leave. Which is in 15 hours. Props to this place."}
{"text":"Okay I have been raising children for over 20 years and never once have I had a chicken tender/finger or nugget meal by choice. My family has our eat out days on the weekends and it was my turn to pick the place. Who picks the Original Chicken Tender for lunch? Me, mom that's who. These are the best chicken tenders I have ever eaten. If you've never tried this restaurant in the Luxor food court, you better get your butt down here as soon as possible. The meal seems pretty pricey but you are getting what you pay for. I ordered the 4tender meal with fries and had to pay for the drink separately.  

When I got to the table an assessed my food, they had put in an extra little baby tender which I gave to my hubby to try. He thought he'd been here before until he tried the baby tender. It was right about then when he regretted getting his chili dog from Nathans (when he could of picked up a pack of Nathans hotdogs from the commissary for $3. ha ha) I managed to only eat two tenders and my cup of fries before I became too full to finish. Dear daughter got the same meal as I did and was filled up too. I need to make mention that this 12 year old didn't even look over at the McDonalds two doors down when she found out we were going to the Original Chicken Tender.  

Dear daughter went to the register to get a bag for our food. I sheepishly asked her to ask if they gave free refills as I well hella thirsty after ingesting a cup of fries and fried chicken with my 16oz. cup half full of ice. She came back and said they did. Yes, I did send her back up there for more Pepsi. I thought maybe they were having sympathy on the kid but would turn me down.lol  

Being a local, I wouldn't fight traffic on the weekend but will be going back during the week day whenever I have spare time and the craving."}
{"text":"These are the best chicken tenders I've ever had. Really fresh tasting and tender. Didn't know chicken tenders could be like that. The regular fries are just standard fries. Really good food option for a food court, and probably better than most restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"We wanted something to snack on so we tried this place for the first time.  Very impressed with the chicken tenders.  They taste light and not greasy.  I would definitely eat here again, specially for a late night snack."}
{"text":"The chicken tenders were fried to perfection and were very moist. The honey mustard sauce was also good. I would've rated it higher had the fries been crunchy (they were soggy)."}
{"text":"It's located in the MGM'a food court. 
I had never seen this place before, but chicken sounded good. I ordered a five piece chicken tenders with fries for $9.95 and a cup of water to share with my boyfriend. 
They give you a pager after they ring you up to come back for your food. It didn't take too long, and when I was called, they were very nice and gave me an extra side of sauce when asked.
The chicken tenders were really good. The chicken wasn't dry, like I expect most chicken tenders to be, and their original sauce is good - although... I don't know what it's ingredients are. Lol."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. The tenders are light and flakey moist with a great taste.  This place is a sleeper. If you are close to Luxor do your self a favor and try it... You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Please whatever you do, don't eat here. I made the mistake of eating here three days ago and have been throwing up ever since. Originally, I thought it was food poisoning but now I'm convinced it's salmonella seeing as how it's been three days and I am still unable to eat anything. Do yourself a favor and don't risk ruining your vacation at this place."}
{"text":"Went here after watching some football at one of the hotels. 

There was no line so we were able to order right away. I went with the three piece meal with a side of french fries and macaroni.

The chicken tenders were pretty spot on. They were fresh and had a nice flavor to them with the breading.

The fries on the other hand were decent, but didn't have a ton of flavor. Unfortunately, my highest hopes were for the macaroni and it definitely did not meet my expectations.

Overall, this is a decent place to grab a reasonably priced bite to eat along the strip and is a good amount of food as well."}
{"text":"The people who worked here were really nice, and I got a really large portion of food. Not nearly as over-priced as most of the other places on the strip. The taste and quality its comparable to Cane's. My only complaint is that the food was really greasy. Definitely ask for extra napkins :)"}
{"text":"Food court at the Luxor, not great. Typical McDonalds, Starbucks, so we decided to try Original Chicken Tender - yum! Chicken is delicious, crispy & flavorful. There wasn't much of a line, but to get the order, it took us 12-min. Shoe string French fries, ok."}
{"text":"Delicious! I think these are the best tenders than anywhere else. First of all, before this location at Monte Carlo I had only tried the location at Luxor, stroll very good, but this location at Monte Carlo is 5 times better. Just as u bite into the tender it is just so juicy and hot. And the fries are very moist and squishy just how I like, and u actually do get more fries here. 

Point is, lol, u can't choose from either a 3,4,or 5 piece meal with fries and special sauce, or u can substitute it for sweet potato fries. Drinks are separate. I did take note that there are also several milkshake options. As well as choosing a tender sandwich with Texas toast or a regular hamburger bun, of course topped with the special sauce. 

This location is combined with a Nathan's Hot Dogs. Takes about 7 minutes for your meal to be cooked.

Give it a try, you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Every time im at the Luxor I have to stop at this place. Located in the food court on the second floor. The menu is very simple, mostly tenders, tender sandwiches, fries, different sides, and milkshakes. But I like to stick to the originals such as just the tenders, fries and their special sauce. 

The chicken has a nice crunchy layer, but my favorite are their fries. My favorite types of fries are squishy and flexible and that's just the way these fries are. The sauce is very refreshing, one container surprisingly is enough for your meal, but u can always ask for more.
You can also choose to order it in a sandwich, either in Texas style toast or a hamburger style bun, and yes it is smothered in their special sauce in the sandwich."}
{"text":"Located in the food court at the Luxor casino. Similar to canes. Food court was very clean. The tables, the floor, and the chairs were spotless.  Rare for food courts. Prices are always jacked up in a casino so I didn't have mind paying $16 for my chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"By far, best chicken tenderness I've ever had. I come to MGM just for them."}
{"text":"limited food court so i picked to try this place out. for $8.59 (7.95 before tax) i got the 3 chicken tenders with fries. chicken tenders were okay/not bad. fries sucked not the best and greasy with so flavor. over all its an okay place if you like chicken. check it out. but....

why its an a-ok three stars rating is because my friends and i had to wait 30 minutes for our food. RIDICULOUS. there was one girl working and two guys. the one girl was cooking ALL the food. the other two guys did not help her and were just standing around. she cooked the chicken tenders and the fries. the guys would just either ring up a customer and then stand there to package the food. even packing the food didn't make sense. they would put everything in the bag side ways so when i went to pick up the back and walk back to my hotel it all fell out.

truly there needs to be a manager or someone there checking their workers out. 30 minute wait for three chicken tenders and some fries is crazy. wasn't even busy. props to that one girl tho. working her butt off..."}
{"text":"Come here to watch the Brett Eldredge in concert at the Park Theater, try out their food court, not very big, a few booths and lots of table.. the chicken tender is gooooooood, so as the Philly cheese steak, got them from The Original Chicken Tenders."}
{"text":"Let just start with this is the worst chicken I've ever had. Taste all old and nasty. The ranch was fake, like the kind you get with your carrots at a middle school cafeteria lunch. And it was expensive. But the fries were ok."}
{"text":"Literally the most delicious chicken tenders I have ever had the pleasure of eating. So crispy, scrumptious and delicious. They take about 12 minutes to make but it's so worth it because They make it fresh for you and it actually is not greasy at all! On top of that, they Have this really good homemade sauce that pairs ever so well with their tenders and fries. Yummy! My friends and I have not found a \"mouth-watering\" restaurant in viva la Vegas and although this is fast food, it does the trick! Decently priced and worth every bite. Your love for chicken tenders have not been satisfied until you've had them from the \"original chicken tender.\" ;)"}
{"text":"Needed a quick lunch before my tour so my gf and I decided to go here.  How can ya go wrong with chicken tenders right? Well man was i wrong...it took 30 mins to get my 4 chicken tenders. I already finished eating the Chinese food from next door, and I was waiting on these.  A random stranger always walked up to the counter with me wondering about the time it was taking. So, I'm speaking for this guy too...let's call him Bob. It came out and the tenders were crazy small and weirdly battered like it was battered fish. At the end of the day, Bob and I were disappointed."}
{"text":"Got the 5 piece chicken tender with the fries.  It was pretty good hangover food; it was fresh and really hot (temperature-wise) too.  And the sauce went great w/ the order.

Customer service was good."}
{"text":"We came on a Monday evening and ordered
1. Original Texas Toast Tender Sandwich, 10.95
Chicken Tenders with Original Sauce and coleslaw served on Texas toast
2. Original Tender Sandwich, 10.95 
Chicken Tenders with Original Sauce and Lettuce served on a Potato Bun
Rather the french fries, we upgraded them to sweet potato fries for $1 more for $14.95 (We used the Casino Guide BOGO coupon) 

- In Luxor. They also have it at Monte Carlo. 
- Chicken tenders better than Chick-Fil-A! But Chick-Fil-A has better sandwiches. 
- The sandwiches had 2 chicken tenders. 
- It came with side buffalo sauce. 
- Sweet potato fries taste better than Boiling Crab! 
- Sandwich and fries were fresh. 
- For the price, it's pretty expensive, but if you have a coupon, it's worth a try!"}
{"text":"The chicken tenders are really good. The fries are okay. The coleslaw tastes like fish. I spit it out. They are stingy on sauces. To make it a platter don't think its fries and a drink it's a fat slice of bread (not even Texas toast. It's literally a piece of bread with one side of butter) I can't taste the butter. Really sad this place sucks other than the chicken."}
{"text":"My kids loved the food here. They ordered chicken strips and french fries. A lot of places pass out coupons for this place and even the other food places in the food court give coupons on the tray, so try to use a coupon. My kids wanted to eat here another night but they were closed. They close earlier than the other food places in the food court."}
{"text":"Really good food! The chicken is cooked fresh and it is very moist. Reminds me of canes chicken right down to the sauce and Texas toast. Service is good, there is a wait but its worth because it's fresh. Definitely one of the better food court restaurants I've been to."}
{"text":"It's late. You're a little drunk. You're staying at the Luxor. You're too lazy to go out. You're hella sick of McDonalds.

This is your second-best choice. Nothing more. Nothing less.

The chicken tenders are tasty, but you stomach probably isn't feeling too great after day three of a daquiri taper anyway, so you'll feel icky not matter what you eat. Greasy deep-fried food might as well happen. Go hard or go home."}
{"text":"I really like this place for chicken tenders. It's a perfect lunch place to get a quick bite. This place takes a while to give you the order but it's only because they make every meal fresh. The batter to the chicken breast is thin and it taste like it was baked even thought it was fried. The chicken always easily comes apart. They have a brown secret sauce as dip and it's compliments the chicken strips even more. They also have Ranch and barbecue as well! The regular fries and sweet potato fries are always good and non greasy. 

I will never come to Vegas and not eat at this place because Vegas is the only place they have \"Original Chicken Tenders\""}
{"text":"So. These are good chicken tenders. They REALLY reminded me of Raising Can'es... especially their sauce. But honestly way overpriced. It's an extra $1 to upgrade from fries to another side... The food was pretty decent..... the only complaint I have is the fact that the breading falls of way too easily. So whenever I would dip the tender in the sauce I would get a tender back with no breading or sauce and the breading left in the sauce."}
{"text":"Not the greatest chicken strips I've had, but still a solid, reasonably-priced food option at the Luxor. True to their name, the chicken tenders are very tender with a light breading. They're a little bland but the sauce that comes with the order adds a much needed kick of flavor. I opted for the sweet potato fries as my side order and I'm so glad I did. They're really friggin' good. And their lemonade is AWESOME. I don't know if it's freshly made but definitely isn't the typical overly-sweet fountain soda version. I actually went back for a second order! If you're staying at the Luxor and looking for a quick, tasty meal, Original Chicken Tender is the way to go."}
{"text":"Flavorless chicken strips and chicken sandwich. If you're looking for a quick snack this wouldn't satisfy you."}
{"text":"WAY overrated...
read some reviews that these were the best chicken tenders on the planet.  whatever.
obviously those folks have not been to chick-fil-a....
as a southern boy, there is just no comparison to chick-fil-a...
in fact, we have like a million places that have better chicken tenders than this.
also, my 5 piece and a drink was over $16.  seriously.  that is the dumbest thing i have ever heard.
these were the greasiest, nastiest chicken tenders i may have ever eaten. i  would rather have a mcnugget...and i never thought i would say that..."}
{"text":"Food is ok, but it's pricey like everything else at the Grand. Cheaper than any of the food outside the food court, though."}
{"text":"The chicken strips here were the best ever! I don't even know how to explain it. The chicken tenders were so soft and moist, it was like nothing I've ever had before. The batter was light, crispy and flaky. This greatness was also the chicken used on the chicken sandwich. The perfect strips plus their special sauce which was a mildly spicy, sweet mayo served on a buttery brioche bun was a superior meal. The fries were thinly cut and salted to perfection. This was a great meal. You will never taste chicken like this at any other place. It was a great surprise for a food court meal in Vegas. We will definitely indulge again..."}
{"text":"Food is alright, maybe pretty good?

Really expensive for what you get. I know it's Vegas but it's STRAIGHT ROBBERY HERE PEOPLE."}
{"text":"Fresh and high quality. Customer service was good and the chicken had a nice crispy batter."}
{"text":"This is the one in Luxor... a lot of people and the front desk recommend here... 

this is on the second floor with other food court... i knew other places so this was perfect opportunity to check this place... at first glance, they seem over priced... but whatever everything is bit over price in LV... so i had the five chicken tenders,... i didn't want a drink but the guy was kinda looking at me like i should get it...  which was extra $5 for a diluted drink, but thats my fault... vending machine has $3 cold drink... the food came out surprisingly fast... i went to my room, which may have taken 2-4 minutes and i sat down to eat... and it was barely warm... i don't expect to be hot or anything but warm... not fried before and been on the warmer for along time... 

you can expect i won't be coming back... almost $20 for a barely warm chicken tenders... w/e..."}
{"text":"The food here was surprisingly decent. After a week of disappointing crusine that cost an arm and a leg (and this from a New Yorker), it was refreshing to find a place where you get what you paid for. The tenders were nice and crispy but in terms of flavor kindof bland compared to Popeye's chicken. You definitely need sauce with these. The place looked clean and the staff is helpful. Good place after a long day and a week of paying for expensive food that isn't worth it"}
{"text":"Being in Vegas I was really excited to try new things! Upon arriving I decided to make my first meal here at this establishment, for chicken tenders and fries sounded the most appealing in the food court which was titled \"the district.\" 

I ordered the four piece, which came with fries and dipping sauce. My mom had the sandwich, which also came with fries. My chicken strips tasted fresh, and weren't oily whatsoever, my only complaint is that I wish they had been a little crispier. My moms sandwhich was sturdy with ingredients and she was happy. I would eat here again."}
