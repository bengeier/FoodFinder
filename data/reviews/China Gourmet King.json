{"text":"I ordered delivery from China Gourmet King this evening and was pleased that it was delivered in a timely manner and was very hot. However, I found the food wasn't to my taste. The chicken didn't seem to be very good quality, we ordered soo guy, lemon chicken and chicken balls and found with each dish that we were throwing away a few pieces of pink stringy chicken. The chicken fried rice and vegetable lo mein were just ok and the wontons were nice. I ordered a garden spring roll thinking garden meant vegetable but it was full of meat so I guess not. The chicken curry didn't come with any steamed rice like most other restaurants give. All in all not worth the money and I don't think we will be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my food here. I ordered takeout and the food was plentiful, hot, and really tasty. I ordered a lot of food and it was prepared very quickly without harming the quality.  The dishes I ordered were spicy vegetarian tofu, mushroom fried rice, vegetable mushroom chop suey, and stir fried mixed vegetables with almonds. All of the dishes were prepared really well.  I don't have any complaints with my order except that the tofu in the vegetarian spicy tofo wasn't the traditional type of tofu you'd get in restaurants in China. Next time I order I'll have to make sure that I ask them to not add any MSG to my items."}
{"text":"This is Scarborough's best kept food secret.  Best Chicken Balls ever, they deliver consistently hot, delicious food with great customer service."}
{"text":"We have been working our way through the menu's at www.justeat.ca and this place caught our eyes because they had a 20% off offer. Mind you, we found out after looking at the menu, that you needed to spend $50.00 to save that 20% It wasn't tough to order that much anyways.  We were most impressed by the quality of the meat we ordered, we are big chicken lovers, and ordered a few chicken dishes, every item had white meat, this was a nice change.  We will order again"}
{"text":"I've been ordering from CGK since about 1998. The food has been very consistent over the years. Not bad for a take out joint. The service is always fast and friendly, I have done pick up and delivery. Their neck of the woods is a bit rough as you'll see in the strip mall where they're located, but they are always nice to me when I order. I recommend the Singapore Noodles with pork and shrimp, the cantonese chow mein is excellent as well as all the other \"white man's style\" chinese food (read: Cantonese) My guilty pleasure: The daily lunch special with 3 chicken balls and sweet and sour sauce, chicken fried rice and chop suey. It's 5 bucks and it's nicely prepared just the way The Garden in Tillsonburg did back in the 70's."}
