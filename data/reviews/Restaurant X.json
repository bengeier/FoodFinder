{"text":"Experienced the X for the first time.  It was magnificant.  We could not decide what app to get, so we got two.  The sliced tomato's and moz cheese, basil and the the shrimp spring rolls.  Both very good.  I liked the spring rolls best.  We split a salad.  Forgot they have a good variety of beer.  Some interesting choices.  I had the Marlin special.  Very good, served with mashed sweet potatoes and green beans.  My wife had the salmon. I had to try that, it was very good. Great selection of desserts.  We really went all out.  It was so good.  Service was excellent.  Someone was always asking if we needed something.  The owner was very active in the whole evening.  I feel that when school starts it may be hard to get in without reservations.  We will be going back.  It's small enough that the staff is not rushed.  They take really good care of you.  Very good experience."}
{"text":"I affirm every good thing said by prior reviews here.  I had lunch here last week.  Perhaps it is in some part because of its reputation, but when you enter, you feel that they take their food seriously, but not themselves.  In appearance it could pass for a small-town diner.  Every plate that I saw, however, including those for my fellow diners, looked delicious and elicited strong positive responses.  I had a crab-cake-like entree made with langoustine.  The fact that they would offer such exotic fare was reason enough for praise, but the entree was delicious."}
{"text":"Quaint small restaurant. Warm weather seating available. Great selection of salads. I enjoyed my chicken Caesar salad. Companion enjoyed Asian steak salad. Chocolate mousse was delicious. Service a bit spotty but very friendly. I will definitely return to this restaurant many times. It's on my list of go-to places in the area. :)"}
{"text":"My Dad lives in Davidson so I've eaten here many times over the past few years.  We've always had superb service and amazing food.  It's by far our favorite restaurant in Davidson.  

Between my dad, husband, and myself I would say we've had a vast majority of what's offered and we've always been pleased.  Personal favorites include the seafood trio that's offered as an entree special, the smoked salmon corn pancake stack appetizer and the beef brisket entree - but seriously everything is great. As for deserts I love the raspberry crème brûlée, but my husband would say the banoffee is the best and he's actually from N. Ireland!  

Christina and her staff are top notch.  They are very warm and welcoming.  We've never had anything but exceptional service.  In fact I now just let my normal server chose a wine for me to go with my entree selection.  I also love the outdoor seating - big plus.  

I just don't think I have enough good things to say about Restaurant X!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Came in with a big group and they took great care of us!!!

The owner Nick was awesome."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch selection! We went here last Saturday morning and it wasn't the usual crowded restaurant where we waited for 45 minutes for a table like most places--granted this was when the weather was horrible from the hurricane, so that could have had something to do with it. But we received excellent service and food (we had the chicken salad sandwich and bacon, egg, and cheese on wheat)! The mimosas were delicious as well. We'll definitely be coming here again very soon!"}
{"text":"Great gem of a restaurant! My DH found it while searching for a place that served a full English breakfast (due to my love of all things British). This place does not dissapoint. We both ordered the full English. It was cooked well and very tasty. I loved the combination of flavors. The coffee was very good and my cup was never empty. I loved the atmosphere! It's a  cozy place. We were able to have a conversation and hear one another speak.  The location ( right next to Fuel Pizza on Main St) is less congested than other Davidson hotspots. The service was great! Everyone we encountered was friendly and accomodating. The owner Nick was kind enough to stop by and make us feel welcome. I am looking forward to coming back for dinner soon. I'm giving Restsurant X 5 stars because it has all the elements that make a restaurant appealing to me; clean, great food, great service, warm, welcoming AND great prices. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Wow. Great, fresh and tasty food !  And an on-site owner who actually comes by each table to check and see how things are. So happy to have a place that understands how to make fresh food with great taste."}
{"text":"This was an absolutely wonderful dining experience. Quiet, intimate and fairly casual. The canon trite was fabulous as was the coconut banana rum bread pudding. This restaurant should not be missed."}
{"text":"Lets start of with, they had $3 Mimosas. That was already a great start. We split Pancakes and the Western Omelet. Service was great and food was excellent too. We will be back again."}
{"text":"Amazing staff and food!!!!  Owner came in to make sure we were well taken care of! Great people. Thank you for a great experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, excellent atmosphere!! The patio is the perfect place for a mid morning brunch on a nice sunny day. Finally, a place that got it right!!"}
{"text":"Best fish and chips ever. Nick the owner rocks. Walked in with 30 people and they made our night amazing."}
{"text":"I can't believe we missed this place.  This is a solid 5 stars.  Great service and the food is really spot on.  The beef brisket is a must.  The Shepard pie is great.  I salute the owners, a husband and wife team   Please check these guys out for dinner.  I am told the Sunday brunch is great too.  Well done!!"}
{"text":"We love the independents. Our first visit was very enjoyable.  A smaller, comfortable setting that filled up quickly. 

First,our server (Jennifer) was the best. Very cordial and attentive. The owner also kept up with us and made us feel at home. Not being a wine drinker, I looked over the beer list which is quite the selection. I chose a Kronnenbourg which I've never been offered in a restaurant outside of St. Marteen (memories of vacation!) Appetizers were very good. Always wanted to try grilled Romaine. Wasn't dissappointed. The grilling brings out a wonderful flavor.  Our party of four had crab cakes and the special seafood trio. The trio was delicious - crab cake, salmon & tuna atop mashed potatoes. I had to clean my plate.  The only drawback of the whole experience was the bread which did  not taste good. A good bread would have been the final compliment to the meal.

 All in all, a very good meal, service and evening. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Hidden gem definitely!  First time there today for brunch and couldn't resist the restaurant favs. He had the Bangers & Mash and I had the Chorizo Shrimp and Grits per the waitresses suggestion. Hands down the absolute best shrimp and grits, and I've ate that PLENTY of places in PLENTY of states. We will most definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Here for wife's birthday...my daughter is along..they are headed to a community play as I write this..
Let me say... We are here because we love this restaurant , but tonite was not good.
My daughter had a steak fillet that tasted like kerosene . 
When I reported this to our waitress she all but ignored the feedback. No apology, no Bill adjustment, no free dessert nothing... :(
With this being a birthday dinner, a free dessert  would have smoothed over the problem and been an expected  gesture ( we are regulars).  
Not so... So here I am writing this \"critical\" review. It could have and should have been different."}
{"text":"The shrimp salad sandwich was tasty.  Had large shrimp pieces - not the canned stuff.  I asked for it on the Ciabatta bread which was a good choice.  Raspberry creme brulee was good but I've eaten better.  My friend said the chicken vegie soup was excellent.  We ate in the covered patio - not the greatest ambiance.  The inside was even stranger - the painted cement floor was slick as an ice rink!!  They said it gets that way in high humidity or when it rains."}
{"text":"Fish and chips for Friday lunch cannot be beat. Get there before they're gone.

It's obvious when  place cares about the food they serve and that is the case at Restaurant X. You don't go for giant portions of mediocre food. You go for quality fresh food and they don't disappoint.

The dining room is small and can feel close when it's busy.

These guys know what they're doing and it shows."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Variety of fresh sandwiches and salads. The blackened chicken is actually really blackened. It's extremely hard to find a restaurant in North Carolina that can make authentic blackened chicken and it's always moist. Love their daily soups and pastas. I haven't tried everything on the menu but so far no processed food. Everything fresh made."}
{"text":"This week's edition of Excited about Eating visits Restaurant X in the college town of Davidson, North Carolina. This bistro-type restaurant offers an international menu featuring pub fare, seafood, and upscale beef dishes.

Dora here. It's easy to see why they've been nominated six times for the Open Table Diners Choice Award. Food choices were great, but they also offer several seating alternatives. We chose the covered patio. The plastic screen makes it nice and toasty for winter diners. 

We visited on Saturday during Brunch, so I chose Shepherd's Pie, meat, vegetables, and gravy blanketed with mashed potatoes. We visit a lot of pubs and I have ordered Shepherd's Pie many times, but I have to say, this was the best ever! The meat and gravy, with deep flavors and just the right amount of juice, blended very well with the mashed potatoes. It was the type of dish that you just couldn't stop eating until it was all gone, and that happened quicker than usual because my wife enjoyed it also.

Dora here. Guilty! I confess my fork kept digging in to that wonderful goodness! I was powerless to control it. The flavors popped and it wasn't overloaded with unnecessary vegies like some. Warm and perfect for a cold day!

Good thing you also enjoy Fish and Chips, Ernie. Phew! And the fries were just the way hubby likes them, thin and crispy, the kind you can gobble down a ton and not feel heavy or bloated afterward. The fish batter was nice and light, not greasy, with generous portions.

Restaurant X is located on Main Street, along with many other quaint local restaurant. It's a beautiful area, one I imagine we will explore more fully soon. 

We rate this restaurant 5 fork out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"Check out the new patio chairs (replaced the inside chairs and moved the old outside) what a great move! Love, love love the change. Also makes more room on the patio for seating as well as comfort. The best little spot in the Davidson area!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed sitting outside on a Sunday morning eating brunch at Restaurant X. The service was very fast and attentive. I enjoyed the meal. The menu was pretty short and basic, but I would maybe try it again."}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight at Restaurant X and it was the worst experience I have ever had. My mom and my husband both ordered the burger and they both were burnt to a crisp. My mom ate two bites and my husband ate half before deciding they couldn't stomach anymore. Despite what the owner thinks, you do need to take a couple bites of something to realize it is as bad as you think it is. We told the waitress the burgers were burnt, because, well, waitresses ask how your food was. Then the owner comes over to our table and says \" I heard that you thought the burgers were overcooked, that's how you cook burgers on an open flame, it's not hard. It sounds like you're being picky.\" WHAT? Then he says \"fine you ate half so well comp half of the meal, couldn't have been that bad.\" My husband told him we do not need it comped and that's not what we were asking for and to please leave our table. This man then says, \"this is my restaurant, I'll leave your table when I want to leave your table.\" EXCUSE ME?! What kind of person who works in the food service industry, let alone is the BUSINESS OWNER talks to customers this way?! This man was literally standing at our table telling at us and accusing us of being too picky. After he left, my mom said she had a charred taste in her mouth that she couldn't get rid of. We will never be back, strictly because of this man's behavior. The crappy food is now just an after thought. Save yourself the trouble and go to any other restaurant in Davidson."}
{"text":"Thank goodness we found this little gem... great place to eat brunch/breakfast.  Family owned.  The name has thrown us off for years and we finally treated ourself. Our family enjoyed French toast, Benedict, and growers western omelette.  We will definitely be back...
Oh and I read previously a bad remark on the potatoes...there is no way they are frozen... they were amazing.  Actually my kids wish the came in a potato bag like a bag of chips."}
{"text":"Ate lunch for the re-opening post car crashing inside the restaurant. This was the first time we ate inside and the ambiance and cozy, cool, clean and stellar attentive service. Started with a cup of curry chicken soup which was awesome.  I had the goat cheese salad with chicken and my husband had the brisket sandwich with fries. Both dishes were very satisfying and I could not help stealing some fries as they are thinly fresh cut and finished with sea salt. The goat cheese was so big I shared with my husband. Cannot wait to revisit on Sunday for brunch."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited last night as we were looking for \"something different\". I am ashamed to admit that I have never even seen this restaurant that is located right beside Fuel Pizza for the last 11 years that Restaurant X has been in existence. But, there it sits in plain view. It is easily accessible with plenty of convenient parking. My wife and I were welcomed by our waiter, Corey, who is every bit entertaining as he is informative. There is a good beverage menu with wines and both craft and traditional beers. No appetizer for us last night. My seared Ahi Tuna over soba noodles with Thai peanut salsa, hoisin glaze & wasabi aioli was perfectly prepared. Perhaps the best that I have ever had. My wife ordered the NC mountain rainbow trout and was very pleased. The accompanying farmer's market vegetables were outstanding. For dessert we split a banoffee pie - bananas and toffee, that was also excellent. The owner Nick circulated among the tables and made us feel welcome. We will definitely be back in the near future!"}
{"text":"ex-X Fan
We used to love Restaurant X for their quaint atmosphere, great food and warm service. After our recent visit, sadly we feel it's gone downhill. Service was great at first until we were politely honest about my Lobster tail meat being too tough to remove from the shell. We aren't complainers, but when asked I thought it only fair to be honest since I had chosen the Lobster tail and Crabcake entree because of the Lobster :) I was very friendly about it and the server offered to bring it back to the Chef to have him remove the meat, but at this point the meat was cold and on one side shredded. I thought he might suggest they just bring another tail (i've never seen Lobster meat stick to the shell like this, so we figured it was a fluke). Instead, the server wanted to take my plate... I was starving and wanted to finish the crabcake (which was yum!) and veggies while still warm. From that point on the service became poor, though not warranted. Later the server came back and took my plate with Lobster tail untouched from point of realizing something wasn't right with the tail and returned 20 minutes later to say they would deduct $8 from my meal. We took that as an insult and that the owners didn't wish to turn the experience around, which is sad because we would've come back and continued to give them business. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone, because the owners don't seem to care about the quality of your experience."}
{"text":"Asked for vegan options. Was told they only had one -- a pesto pasta. Dish came out and was made with cream sauce and melted cheese on top......definitely not vegan. Only redeeming factor was half price bottle of wine night."}
{"text":"In town on business and gave Restaurant X a try. I ordered the special of the evening; seafood trio (sea bass, crab cake and tuna) on a bed of (tasted like instant) mashed potatoes and veggies (steamed green beans and carrots). The meal was ok, nothing special.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive. Nice outdoor and patio seating. The patio was still enclosed but will be nice in the warmer months."}
{"text":"Super disappointed ! Our server was great...... however, when you advise the staff of food allergies  and there was little to no attention to how the food is served, Cross contamination and the chef does not come out and talk to you there is a problem! When you are told not to eat something to be on the safe side that shows no effort or detail was put into the fact that a customer has a food allergy. For example we advised of a gluten allergy and my food cane out on bread. Second we advised of a deadly shellfish allergy and the attention to detail of cross contamination was not adhered to with how the potatoes were cooked. Food was average"}
{"text":"Jeremiah, our waiter was super nice and took care of us. We both ordered the x-factor which consisted of two eggs, bacon, and sausage along with home fries. You have the choice between pancakes or French toast. Decent variety of the typical American breakfast, however underwhelmed by the quality. So-so food, sub par taste, decent ambiance. Nothing to go outta your way for."}
{"text":"Our favorite local restaurant - hands down.  My kids love this place - the fries are 'better than McDonalds\" - hand cut and fresh - perfect!  Same with the chicken fingers.  For me - I always go back to the salmon with a port sauce (I think?) because I can't get enough of it!   You'll feel like family in this small, cozy, wonderful restaurant..."}
{"text":"Yaaay for a five star review!!!  For such an odd name, this place is REALLY good!  I almost changed plans on my friend and wanted to suggest a nearby Mexican restaurant, but thankfully I didn't, and kept to meeting her at Restaurant X, soooo glad for that!

So why is it so awesome?

As soon as you walk in, you'll feel a chill, laid back atmosphere.  With the choice of wall paintings (warm pastel colors) it just says beachy and come in and relax.  

They offer a decent beer selection (with brews listed on a chalkboard) and also a good collection of wine.  I didn't try any alcohol but hope to the next time around.  Everything looked very enticing.

The service is great.  As soon as we entered the place, we were greeted with smiles and a warm welcome.  Our server was very friendly and professional and new the menu well.  When I couldn't decide between the eggplant sandwich and the goat cheese wrap, he gave good feedback on both and I went with the goat cheese wrap (which did NOT disappoint!).  It was soooooooo good!  Fresh and to perfection.   I also had their soup of the day, which was lentil with curry, also AMAZING.  I finished my meal with nothing left on the plate.  My friend had the roasted vegetable and mozzarella sandwich, which looked mouthwatering (I'd love to try that next time!  She had food falling everywhere but couldn't stop inhaling it, she also cleaned her plate and left satisfied.  Both of us couldn't stop saying between bites how good our food was.  The best part is their menu has a nice diversity of healthy (not overfilling) options and lots of choices with fresh ingredients.  I loved the baby tomatoes in my wrap, they were terrific.

I still can't get over that I almost missed out on this.  I am so grateful that I got to eat here and have such a quality lunch.  Great, great, great spot!"}
{"text":"I was SO excited when I saw the menu! I could barely narrow it down to half when I first read through it. I was ok that I had to seat my mom and I ourselves, and that I had to return inside to get our own menus. But it became clear throughout the night that she was the ONLY waitress, and we even wondered by the end of the night if she was the only staff member period. We ordered 6 dishes between the 4 of us - The fish and chips, the red snapper, the brie cheese, and the fried green tomatoes were all wonderful. However, bruschetta was awful - I could not even get the bread to break in half with my fingers. So I then ordered the Mediterranean pizza, and it wasn't much better chewy-wise, and came covered in the peppers I asked her to exclude. But clearly an issue with their bread so I would stay clear of the bread. I had to go inside to ask for bills, and even that took quite a long time and I was 15 minutes late picking up my daughter who had a two hour class nearby. Great menu, but very disappointed by the overall experience which is too bad because I have to eat out in that town every Monday and Wednesday night and I was very much hoping for a \"regular\" place near the theater."}
{"text":"Was expecting much better in this price range.Fish and Chips were very disappointing.Service was poor."}
{"text":"I'm just not seeing it. After reading the reviews here I'm not sure we went to the same restaurant. We went here for late breakfast after seeing the line at a neighboring breakfast spot. This place had two parties present. Red Flag. Waitress barely said hello when she came to fill our glasses.  I think I even initiated the greeting. Her outfit was dirty but hey, it was the end of her breakfast shift. BTW, glasses were dirty. Silverware to match. I'm sorry, but when I sit down to dirty glasses and silverware and then someone greets me in dirty clothes, I take warning.  One of us ordered a side of sausage. When two sausage patties came to the table they looked like they were overcooked in the micowave, dark, small and shriveled.  My friend said they were cold. I had to tell the server as not only did they look awful, they were cold to boot. He quickly replaced them with look-alikes but at least they were warm (someone probably pressed the start button on the microwave). My wife ordered the western omelet which was tasty but included sausage which was a surprise and not mentioned in the menu. Maybe it was ham but, it sure looked and tasted like sausage. My wife also ordered a cranberry juice which she could not finish because of reasons mentioned above. The egg dishes were ok but i do think it is hard to screw up omelets. Anyway, our first breakfast experience at \"X\" was not a good one. Don't think we will be back for breakfast."}
{"text":"Why this place sells salads is beyond me; they should stick to what they're good at and avoid salads. I went with friends and wanted something healthy so got the haricot vert salad with shrimp. Five shrimp, a few green beans, one cherry tomato and about a pound of spinach--$10! A joke. If you go here, don't order a salad and Restaurant X, either take salads off your menu or spend a few pennies and add some veggies."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, I might have had the bar set too high for this place.  The atmosphere was very tight and on a cold night it was not very enjoyable since the wait staff had to open and close the door to get to the heated patio for service.  Overall, the food was good but not great.  We had the salmon and the filet along with the shrimp roll.

Might come back once the temperature gets warmer and enjoy the patio area."}
{"text":"I liked it. 

Restaurant X has great ambiance and you really feel a nice small town charm here with nicer food.

I didn't give it 5 stars because our server was nice and helpful up until a party of 6 came in and then he kind of forgot about us. Not enough to complain about but just something that irked me.

I will be back."}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience here. We didn't plan on going here but at the last minute, decided to give it a try. The food was spectacular, the service was outstanding and we even spent some time with the owner, Nick
They accommodated our large group without a blink. 
Food was incredible. Would love to come back here again."}
{"text":"While out in Statesville. We looked up a vegan brunch place and this came up. We walked to a nice cozy bright and sunny small restaurant. Seated by the host. Our waitress stop by for our coffee and drinks. 
Ok so here's where it gets a little odd for me.. our friend is off and on Vegan. Don't ask!! But we wanted to know what's in their veggies sandwich which is served on some kind of bread. Both waiter and waitress have to go ask the chef.. and a lot of questions we have, they have to run and ask. Soo I'm thinking so do they know the menu. Or are they new., either way, I was annoyed with my friend.. can he be a vegan on a different day.. I ordered a steak and French toasts! Which was delicious.. menu is limited. If you want simple brunch. And what's listed than great. Start to be difficult like my friend, thing starting to get annoying! So if you know my friend than don't take him to Restaurant X. They don't mix!"}
{"text":"Crab cake was delicious, as were the fries and fancy coleslaw.  Service was superb.  I love this place."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch in Sunday morning at around 11 - we were a party of 4 and had out pick of tables, which surprised me. We ate on the patio and really enjoyed the food and experience - this place is a great value! I will definitely come back for lunch and dinner in the future."}
{"text":"Great food, personal service. It was a quiet Sunday and we dined outside on the patio. They took great care of us. I had the Full English Breakfast, always a treat since my wife is British, and she had the Fish and Chips. Nick the owner sat near us and we had a lovely chat. Nice in a shabby/chic kind of way. We'll return for dinner."}
{"text":"I ate at this restaurant just the other day and I have to admit that I was really just not the impressed with the place. We had reservations for ten for a big family dinner and they were well accommodating and the waitress was a real doll. I would say that with our group of ten it didn't seem like they could fit that many more as the place was small but not claustrophobic more cozy and quaint 

My wife and I ordered the Calamari that had a really great dipping sauce however the calamari was over cooked and had a burnt taste to it. We also ordered the \"special\" soup of the day which was a cream of potato soup that was for lack of a better term god-awful. It was very starchy and had no flavor.

The menu really lack in variety and there were not a lot of choices which would be okay had the prices been a bit more variable.

The entrees were good but they were not very large and not really worth the price of the meal. I had the Norwegian Salmon which had a great flavor and the potatoes were delicious but the fish was a little tough and over cooked.

My wife had the seafood trio that came with a crab cake, a piece of salmon and a piece of trout. The crab cake was not very tasty and the two other pieces of fish were very small in comparison. 

I think the place would be a lot better had the prices been a bit cheaper."}
{"text":"Great little bistro in Davidson wonderful wine selection and a lot of local beers are served the food is excellent and the service is great. Even though it was a busy night, with the Christmas in Davidson going on, in thewe had great service and a wonderful time."}
{"text":"A hidden gem!  Excellent food (blue cheese potato chips, seared ahi tuna, brisket, fresh fish, to name a few) and wonderful service.  Owners Chris and Christina make you feel welcome from your very first visit.  This is my team's Wednesday night destination for over two years.  We love the place!"}
{"text":"5 stars for lunch, 4 for dinner.
I LOVE lunch here.  The only negative Tue-Fri are their ONLY lunch service days.  
The owners are fabulous, it is locally owned & operated - you want to meet them, ask they are there everyday as far as I know.  The food is prepared well, the presentation is nice, ingredients fresh and local when possible.  The menu is small but has just enough going on to satisfy most.  I have had 1 issue with customer service in all of the times I have gone (and it was somewhat my fault calling in a to-go order 15 minutes before lunch service ended.  Nobody is perfect, so I am not holding it against them.  

My favorite lunch - Asian Chicken salad in a wrap - with fries (the fries are perfection)

Dinner is high-ish priced in my opinion, but in line with the rest of the restaurants in town.  It is a great place to go for an intimate dinner date.  We walk over for dinner occasionally because we can, but mostly if we are in the mood for a steak.  Nothing to complain about, nothing jaw dropping just good food & great people."}
{"text":"Excellent after Church Brunch

We've lived here for 21 years and I know there have been some recent changes but they have only been for the better.

We attend Church probably no more than 200 yards up the street and used to come here fairly often but the cuisines were bland and too predictable 

They have been closed for several months after a motorist lost control and took out part of the front of the building. Opened again and my wife and I chose to drop in after Church yesterday.

Still a British theme restaurant do er opted for traditional fare.

My wife went with the Banger and Mash and loved them Last time I had the Banger here was several  years ago and I was somewhat disappointed but from the look of the big moist and plump sausages, they were dead on. The Mashed Potatoes were excellent and definitely home made and portions were more that ample.

Shepard Pie is one of my favorites but at the last too restaurants I ordered Shepard Pie at, I was very disappointed. More like from a Food Service Company as opposed to home made.

Not here. Definitely home made with good chunks of meat as opposed to ground beef. Savory vegetables in a thick rich broth topped with mashed potatoes before it was popped in a proper oven and served nice and hot.

This was Shepard Pie the way it should be.

Service was excellent and owner came over and introduced himself which was a nice touch. Dining area is a bit cramped but better on warmer days when the patio is open.

All in all, excellent with great food and service and a place I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I'm planning on coming back when the menu isn't set like tonight with Valentine's Day. For me it was just average and I wanted to be impressed. I've looked at the regular menu so I'll come back to try it again. I was disappointed in the presentation of the shrimp cocktail which were just laying on a plate with the cocktail sauce in a plastic cup. The shrimp weren't deveined and it still had legs. The server was nice but sketchy, he brought my coffee after the meal with no spoon and he pulled out of his front pants pocket the cream for the coffee! I asked twice for a spoon but he forgot and I finally received one from the bus boy. We paid and waited for our check after he took my credit card for 20 minutes and then blamed the bus boy for not bringing the receipt to sign. I could go on to other things but I'm going to keep an open mind and try it again.
Things I liked, the outside heated dining area, it was warm and quite. The entrees were delicious. The owner took time to thank all of the patrons for choosing his restaurant"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant. They have fantastic servers who are always very sweet and knowledgeable about their food. We often go on Wednesday for half price wine. It's hard to pick one dish that stands out to me because I love them all, but I'd have to say the Seared Ahi Tuna is my favorite with the Crabcakes and Shrimp and Grits as close seconds. My parents swear by the Fish and Chips and my husband frequently ends up ordering whatever is on special- usually a pasta or a steak. Between the four of us, we've tried just about the whole menu and have never been disappointed. One thing to note, the lunch salads are somewhat small, so I would suggest adding a protein to fill you up! I always take friends and family here whenever we can't lock down a specific type of food because I know everyone will love their meal!"}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant, a casual British kind of decor. Very nice friendly service, good food, varied menu, good prices. Started with a champagne flight, nice! I had the pulled pork on a ciabatta roll with fries. Very good, all the food was very fresh and generous portions. Liked it very much!"}
{"text":"Very small space; lucky to get a table without a reservation.
Many Davidson students with parents.
Seafood special was excellent, as was the banoffee pie.
Special salad was very tasty, but expensive as a $16 appetizer; not big enough for two people.
Kind of a quirky place, but everyone very pleasant and helpful."}

{"text":"The filet mignon was jucy, tender, the perfect temp and melted in my mouth.  Cory the server has a way for describing food making your mouth water.  With his recommendation I walked away with one of the most amazing pieces of peanut butter pie.  All home made and worth every bite."}
{"text":"Being disappointed by a restaurant really offends me. Came here because of decent reviews and they only had their brunch menu at lunch on Saturday. I ordered the X Factor breakfast (about 11.50) which comes with sausage/bacon/home fries/eggs/pancakes or French toast. I ordered this with French toast. It was delivered with pancakes which I didn't argue about because I was in a hurry and I like pancakes too. The home fries were the square frozen potatoes from a bag. The eggs were cooked perfect. Bacon was limp and flavorless. Pancake was meh. Honestly the grand slam at waffle house is better and 2 or 3 bucks cheaper. Maybe it was a bad day but it definitely hurt my feelings."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating here for the first time today, and my experience was nothing short of amazing! I came in for lunch with three other friends, and we all really enjoyed it. I ordered the blackened chicken Caesar salad, which was more than enough food and had so much flavor. My friends ordered a burger, a philly cheese steak, and lasagna. They all thought everything was delicious as well, and I even tried the lasagna and absolutely loved it! The manager also stopped by our table to make sure everything was good, which I always appreciate. I will definitely be returning, and I recommend Restaurant X to anyone who wants some fresh, delicious food with great service!"}
{"text":"We walked down to Restaurant X after church today and sat outside. A beautiful day for outdoor eating on the amazing patio they have. Food was delicious and fresh. Service was outstanding. We had the blackened Salmon salad, Ahi Tuna Asian salad, and the turkey BLT. Salads were huge and fish was hot and fresh. We really enjoyed visiting with the owner as well! Extremely nice and relaxing lunch!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous food and great service.  The toasted goat cheese salad and nightly special are always a success. Outdoor and indoor seating are available."}
{"text":"The food was really good and the servers were nice and professional...food came out in a timely fashion, and the atmosphere was very enjoyable. For anyone visiting NC in this area I would recommend going here...I even the dessert was really good, and I had just enough room after my meal. Next time I visit NC I will defiantly take time to have another dinner there. The drink specials were good as well had a few of those :)"}
{"text":"We had dinner there late on a Tuesday night and received good service from a friendly Tunisian waitress. Food came out quickly and hot with nice sized portions. It is a quiet and cozy restaurant in Davidson with a good range of food. I particularly liked the pecan encrusted tilapia."}
{"text":"We loved it. Service was outstanding, food was excellent, great atmosphere. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We come here at least twice a month on Sundays for brunch. Make sure you get there before 1pm as they start closing the kitchen at 1pm. We always order the same dish, as we love it, the full English breakfast. My husband loves the London Pride beer, a very tasty traditional English beer. I like to have a glass of rose.

They have half-priced bottles of wine on Wednesdays. We had shepherds pie for dinner. It truly is the best shepherds pie we have had. It came with a side of roasted vegetables, just the way I like them, very crunchy, fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"It only took us 4 years living in Davidson before we tried X and we've been missing out!  Food was very good, service super friendly and ambiance was unique and comfortable.  The interior is quite cozy and gives the feel of a pub overseas.  Prices were about what we expected - reasonable but not a cheap eats place.  I had fish & chips and they were delicious.  My wife had amazing shrimp & grits, sister had a filet to die for, my daughter had beautifully prepared crab cakes and my son devoured his burger and fries.  Don't let the name fool you, Restaurant X is worth remembering."}
{"text":"I love these guys, I really do. The owners, Chris and Tina, are UK transplants and some of the kindest, coolest and hard-working people you'll meet. You'll see Tina greeting and seating, but more often than not Chris is hidden in the kitchen, working the stove. Which explains why everything is so. damn. tasty. 

We stayed in Davidson for the entire summer, and it was such a relief to have X as an option. It feels like something you'd find in a much larger town, more worldly thanks to its creators. 

While Jeff swears by the pasta specials, I'm hooked on the seafood. They grill up a wonderfully tender and flavorful salmon as well as an Asian style Ahi Tuna. For lunch, it was always the goat cheese salad, with a crisp-on-the-outside baked goat cheese patty right in the center, all gooey and soft inside - this may sound high-fat, but I prefer to think of it as high-calcium ;)

And I highly recommend either saving room for dessert or stopping in for a glass of wine or coffee and one of X's sinful confections. I'm a chocolate mousse girl myself, but they're known for the sticky toffee pudding. If you've got a serious sweet tooth try the banoffie (not an Italian term, but banana+toffee=banoffie) pie. 

Can't wait to visit Davidson again and drop in on this local hot spot."}
{"text":"Juiciest bone-in pork chop ever!  The service here is top-notch and the staff is really friendly. The food is outstanding and was cooked to perfection. We had a Jurassic Chop with sautéed spinach and the surf and turf. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I have passed Restaurant X a number of times but finally had the opportunity to visit.  I have to say that the food was really good.   

Started off with a side salad and was very impressed with the way it came out.  For the main meal I ordered the Dinochop.   They were not joking when they say Dinochop (see the picture).  

There was a lot of food and it was all good.   The service was also good and would definitely return again."}
{"text":"Restaurant X is so good -- I came here because I was intrigued by the story of the owners. I've spent some time living in London, so I'm interested in all things British.

They have an amazing selection of bottled beers, including a lot of stuff I've never heard of. I consider myself a little bit of a beer connoisseur so to find a selection like this, especially in the Charlotte area, was surprising. They have a number of beers from England (and not just Boddington's, Bass or Fuller's). They also have a good number of beers from American microbreweries.

Anyway, despite the amazing beer selection, you don't come here just to drink. The food is also pretty spectacular. I got the crab cakes -- some of the best crab cakes I've ever had.

Strongly recommend making the trek out here if you're in the area. Must eats for any foodie."}
{"text":"Restaurant X is simple, delicious food. A no frills dining experience focused solely on the quality of the meal, and the quality is excellent."}
{"text":"All i can say is WOW! What a great experience!  I was in Davidson on business today from Chicago, and looking for a local place to grab lunch.  Thanks to the other reviewers, I found this great little gem!
My experience here can be summed up as: \"Great Food with Southern Hospitality\"!
My server was Aubry, and she was terrific! so friendly and welcoming, and very attentive.  She is an excellent server, and an awesome representative of Restaurant X. :-)
Food wise, I ordered the quiche and salad on Aubry's recommendation, and both exceeded my expectations. generous portions, and tasted terrific.  
The restaurant is very clean, and a nice comfortable, welcoming place to hang out (they have wifi too!). 
Overall, an outstanding experience, and I hope I have time to go back for dinner before I have to return to Chicago.  
Great job Restaurant X and Aubry! Thanks! Steve"}
{"text":"The food is ok, the facilities are ok, the service is good... But the prices do not justify the limited menu and meager portions when those other factors are considered."}
{"text":"We came over to this restaurant because we bought a LivingSocial deal. The decor doesn't tell much about the restaurant but WOW the food is absolutely fantastic! People usually gather in Davidson to have brunch at Toast but this restaurant is as good or better than Toast. The staff is extremely friendly and they were always checking on us.

I had the Steak Benedict (sounds yummy no?), my wife had the omelet and my kid had the pancakes. All of the dishes were outstanding. We read online about the dessert Banofee Pie and I ordered it - WOW!!! Amazing!!!

This has become now a spot for us on Sunday brunch :)."}
{"text":"This restaurant has gone way downhill. We have been before and had great food and service.  The last few times have been substantially worse, but the last visit (and it will be the last) takes the cake. We waited over an hour from the time we sat down until we received our food. The manager proceeded to argue with us that it had not been that long (despite the fact that we knew exactly what time we arrived).  Some of the food was cold. Other food took 10 minutes longer to arrive at the table than the rest.  I understand that sometimes places get busy but this type of service seems to be the rule now not the exception."}
{"text":"I think it is funny how it took the owner five months to respond to my previous negative review. That in itself should tell you a lot about this restaurant. However I do not find his boldface lies funny at all! We DID NOT eat the entire meal. That is ludicrous. We WERE NOT offered a free dessert and therefore COULD NOT have eaten it all. That too is a lie. Lastly, we did ask to speak to whomever was in charge that day. We did get a nice young man who did his best to help us, however the damage was already done. 

I must also say that the way my wife was treated and talked down to that day by our waitress is inexcusable. Never should a customer be treated or talked to the way my wife was treated! 

So in a nutshell, if you want absolutely terrible food, an extremely rude waitress, and to be called a liar in a public forum, then by all means go to Restaurant X and leave a critical review on Yelp."}
{"text":"Have wanted to try this restaurant for some time, as we have family ties to Ireland, and miss the cuisine.  We finally got the opportunity to give it a try for breakfast.  Although the food was fine, it was nothing special (Irish bangers were good).  We found it expensive relative to what we received and the area, and the service was just \"ok\", especially considering the lack of patrons.  Kitchen refused to accommodate a simple request, which was disappointing.  We'll be happy to return to Toast next time we are out for breakfast."}
{"text":"Opens at 9:30 means that you open at 9:30. I walked up three times to the door - 3 separate employees saw me and my son. I left in disgust at 9:40."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast last week and unfortunately will not be returning. It did seem quite odd to be empty on a Saturday morning, but it was our understanding their breakfast / brunch menu were new so we thought we would give it a shot. Hopefully it will improve in the future. The food was very unremarkable, the pancake was quite dense and somehow undercooked in the center. The potatoes seemed as if they were simply the standard frozen potatoes you can get from Sam's club, and generally everything seem to be lacking flavor... including the crab benedict. The breakfast sandwich was fine, but not great. I ordered a mimosa hoping to improve the experience, and although it was quite small and weak I didn't think much of it until I realized it cost $8! Pretty ridiculous even for Davidson. In fact, if it wasn't for the $8 mimosa (which cost more than three pancakes on their menu) I would not have bothered to write a negative yelp review because our waitress was so lovely and I generally don't like writing negative reviews on small businesses. But it was quite an expensive breakfast for what we received and there are simply too many wonderful breakfast spots around to compete."}
{"text":"Wanted a nice night , it's a hit or miss place....we were so underwhelmed .  Messy presentation , barely warm food. 2nd visit. Off the list, sad we tried."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here with my wife and a couple friends Friday night.  Got right in without a reservation. Salads were just ok.  My wife enjoyed the grouper special.  I had the brisket which was very dry and bland. Think pot roast overcooked without gravy. With a drink each our bill was over $70.   For that kind of money I expect something better.  We would go back if someone else really wanted to go there, but I would not get the brisket again."}
{"text":"Skip the wait at Toast. Food here is just as yummy and the porch is a great spot to sit. Great non breakfast choices too. Pancakes were spot on and the eggs benedictory was done the real way in boiling water. Loris of coffee ... Key on a Sunday morning!"}
{"text":"Great place for Sunday Brunch. Great new owners that really care about their food."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for a Sunday brunch for our 2nd year wedding anniversary (because it's the \"cotton\" anniversary and this is right next to \"Cotton Gin Road\") and I could not have been happier with everything here. I ordered the \"Full Monty\" and my wife ordered the \"Full English\" and boy were we satisfied on every level.

The Full Monty - The Full Monty is two crab cakes combined with eggs benedict, home fries, and a delicious mozzarella topping.  It was fantastic.  It was so good I stopped eating a quarter of the way through because I became sad that I only had 75% of my meal left so I tried to savor it more. Everything about it is amazing (except for the health factor.)  I felt like I was hitting every happy taste bud in my mouth with my first bite and all I wanted was more (even though I was happily full).

The Full English - This is a little bit of everything from eggs, home fries, a \"banger\" which is a thick English sausage, this creative curried mushroom smidgen, baked beans, bacon, and toast.  It's a little bit of everything and you will feel soooo delightfully full.  

It's was about $10 per meal which I thought was very reasonable.  Do not expect a fancy restaurant, but to be honest, I preferred this place much more than the \"Terrace Cafe\" in Charlotte. Combined with their nice outdoor seating, no wait on a Sunday morning, and lot-parking, my experience at Restaurant X was truly an anniversary-grade experience.

I forgot to mention that I did order the Banoffee (banana-caramel) pie that was highly recommended by other Yelpers. Unfortunately, it too sweet and decadent for my wife and my tastes but I didn't want to let it soil my opinion of Restaurant X."}
{"text":"We live in Davidson, NC now and this was our second attempt at this restaurant.  I made reservations on Open Table and shared that we were celebrating an anniversary, which we were.  When we checked in, there was no acknowledgement of our celebration, I was actually surprising my husband. So, that was the first issue. 
The food turned out ok which is why I gave it 3 stars. Service, not so much. Our waiter moved very slowly and gave the impression that he really wanted to be anywhere else but there.  He didn't ask if we wanted dessert, brought the check and after we paid it, never saw him again.
We were hoping for a special celebration in a local casual restaurant but weren't expecting the \"too\" casual service. 
Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and fresh. Their homemade fries are so yummy! The restaurant was very clean. Super friendly and attentive staff! #tinaforpresident"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a following, and its not the food that draws them in, its the casual and cozy ambience that it offers. Dining here is strangely familiar, like eating on the porch of your favorite aunts house. I don;t know what it has that effect, but it simply does.

The food is slightly better than average. I am writing this a few days after I went and I can barely remember the food. In fact, I honestly can't remember what any of us ate there.  Nothing was bad, but nothing was spectacular enough to stick in my memory.

The service, the feel that everyone knows everyone is very present here. So, if you are homesick and in need of a home cooked meal, I think this place is perfect for that."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch and had the bubbles and squeak with Irish bangers. Meh. Nothing special, expected more based on the reviews, service was good at least."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch to celebrate my sister's birthday, our server was a delight, the drinks and food came out quickly and were delicious. Everyone was friendly and the overall experience was great! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"'X' marks the spot. Literally. This little gem was the Davidson Ice House when I was a student there in the mid-1970s. It's on NC 115, just South of town, next to Fuel Pizza. 

Restaurant X is a quaint little place with a small dining room and a four seasons porch. (Call ahead for reservations!) The owners are very personable, laid back, and talented. He is English, his wife Irish. They've been in NYC and San Fran, and settled on the Charlotte area as a place to take up shop and raise a family.

The service is attentive but, like the hosts, laid back, and talented. 

The menu was a one-page list of choices that were all wonderful-sounding. This place has a short beer and wine list, too, but I like their taste. Having a pot load of choices is never a great thing in my world, because it hides poor ones and wastes time choosing. So I rather like the short menu and drink lists. The hosts seem to have chosen real gems, and they can manage to cook everything properly that way.

The food this New Year's Eve 2009 was excellent. I had a concoction of sea bass and shrimp in a wonderful sauce over rice, with what tasted like smoked, grilled green beans and carrots. My wife had a Salmon in pastry shell dish with potatoes and veggies. We tried the crab soup, too. Portions were big enough we were full, and avoided dessert. We'll have to go back and try that later!

This would be a great place to go after a show or before a game at the college. If I were a student there, I'd take my visiting parents. If you're a parent, please suck it up and take your student... Know that there were NO really good restaurants in Davidson 30 years ago. This definitely rates four solid stars in my experience, maybe four and a half. Go try it!"}
{"text":"The food is always great here, but the Banoffee Pie is the stuff of legends.  Trust me.  Just order it."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate the food separate from the staff (OWNER). The food here is hands down awesome!! Best fish and chips, we drive 45 minutes for them. My husband and I have now gone a few times and always well taken care of. Well the other night we made reservations, showed up at our time and was ignored by the owner. The other staff member tried and help seat us but she kept pushing him off. Other parties, who did not have reservations were even sat before us. Once we were seated, we ordered. Now we ALWAYS split meals. I mean really their food is way too much for one person. We were not informed there would be a splitting fee, we were never charged it before, so when our bill came the charge was on there. The owner came to our table and gave us the hardest time. We do not have a problem paying it but now its the principle behind it. As an owner of the restaurant I would have expected for her to just apologize about the confusion and take it off, she argued with us and finally took it off. Like I said, LOVE the food but the owner has no respect for people coming to eat there!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed another delicious meal at Restaurant X today. If you haven't been there for the weekend brunch, please give it a try. There is a nice assortment of breakfast and lunch items, and nothing is run of the mill. I had what I usually have when I go there for brunch- the Full English Breakfast. It consists of two eggs, home fries, grilled tomato, curried mushrooms, an English banger (sausage),English bacon and toast. Everything was delicious, especially that banger. Restaurant X is a nice local place, run by a very friendly husband and wife team, and their kids were helping out today. There is nothing pretentious about the place at all, but the food is consistently fresh, well prepared, and reasonably priced. A winner!"}
{"text":"Home made food!! Mick is a great owner with great hospitality. Try Ahi tuna or fish chips. 

Unique menu, with high quality food!!"}
{"text":"We've been to Restaurant X more times than I can count.  It's one of our favorite places for both breakfast (now served every Saturday and Sunday!) and dinner.  

This is a delightful place, with delicious food and service.  Although they are under new ownership, you won't notice many changes.  The kitchen staff and servers have stayed, and everyone welcomes you like family.  We especially like Carmen and Cory!

Their apple pancakes, eggs benedict, and Irish breakfast are what keep us coming back for breakfast, along with their fantastic service and strong coffee.  The curried mushrooms on the Irish breakfast are amazing, too!

Their dinner menu has stayed pretty much the same over the years, but we have noticed a few nice additions under their new ownership.  We love their shrimp spring rolls and pork belly appetizers, and I usually get one of their specials for my entree.  JC makes the most amazing chicken/pasta dishes - I don't care what he's offering, I always love whatever he prepares.  And I RARELY get chicken when going out - I'm not a huge fan of chicken in general.  My hubby loves their steak, but he'll also branch out on occasion and get either a special or the lamb chops.  

I can't forget to mention their outdoor patio.  They keep it enclosed and heated in winter, and it's quite comfortable, even if it's freezing outside.  In the warmer months, they open the sides so you'll get a nice breeze.  IMO, they have one if the best outdoor dining areas in all of Charlotte.

We love Restaurant X and will continue to be regulars!"}
{"text":"Come for brunch and order the quiche! Thus change up their quiche menu but no matter which one they're serving they are fresh and fabulous! Huge portion, light and fluffy and the perfect crust. I love this casual European Bistro style restaurant. The food is excellent and the ambiance is perfect."}
{"text":"Great food--so so service. It's always a strong performer and the lines outside are a testament. Sometimes they get overwhelmed with the patronage and the service lacks. Not rude--just an attentiveness issue. My son ordered a steak without sauce and not on a bed of spinach--it came out with all the trimmings. Not a big deal, but took 7 minutes to get an extra plate and we fixed it.  The waitress never came back to check on the meal and I had to walk to the counter to get a refill on my son's drink. Like I said--great food--lacking in service when they get busy."}
{"text":"I STRONGLY encourage those who gave Restaurant X less than 4 stars, to give it another try!! My boyfriend and I come to this restaurant once every couple of months or so, and we absolutely love it.  If we spent a bit less when we visited, I am sure we would return more often!  I have really love everything I have had here, but I must say, the Tuna and Salmon here, are my absolute favorites!  My boyfriend often tries the specials and seems to love them.  The restaurant is definately an older crowd... or an older crowd than we are anyway, but the food continues to bring us in!
I would highly suggest sitting outside, even when its winter with the heaters! COZY is the perfect word!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here for dinner last summer - what a pleasant surprise!  (I liked it so much that I went back for lunch two days later.)  This is a fantastic addition to the Davidson/Lake Norman restaurant scene.  The space this restaurant occupies has been a lot of different things over the past several years, but, hopefully, Restaurant X will be here to stay.

The food at Restaurant X is very reasonably priced for the Lake Norman area.  The menu was somewhat limited, but I thought it offered a good range of selections.  It seemed clear that the owners are focusing on preparing a handful of entrees very well instead of preparing a lot of meals poorly.  My wife and I selected entrees that were well under twenty dollars, yet the food was still delicious.  The owners of the restaurant are great, too!   On the evening we went to Restaurant X they were eating dinner with members of their family at a table just down from ours.  One of the owners came down to check on us and to apologize if they were disturbing us (which they weren't), and she ended up chatting with us for about five minutes.  

Restaurant X has a pretty standard lunch menu - with sandwiches, burgers, and the like.  My sandwich was very good on the one occasion when I went there for lunch.  Lunch wasn't quite as reasonably priced as dinner, but it was still very fair for the quality of the food (and also very fair for the area).  

Two other selling points for Restaurant X - the portion sizes are perfect and there is an outdoor seating area.  If you are used to the portion sizes from major chain restaurants - portions sizes that require a forklift to bring to the table - then you may be surprised by what you receive at Restaurant X.  The portions here tend to be much closer to what you \"should\" eat.  You aren't going to leave hungry, but you also won't leave feeling sick from overeating.  The outdoor seating area is nice, too.  Restaurant X is small, so the outdoor seating helps to make the place feel a bit more spacious.  

Restaurant X is a spot you should definitely try!"}
{"text":"How does this restaurant get almost 4 1/2 stars?? It might have been an off night, but the service is meh...we ordered a salad and it came out 3 seconds before our meals. (No exaggeration) While me waited the owner came over and was super nice which hurts me to write a bad review. I ordered the surf and turf and my husband ordered the shrimp and grits. His was ok, but my steak which was ordered \"medium rare\" tasted like shoe leather. I had my husband tasted it and he agreed. The crab cake wasn't anything to go back for either for almost $90 (with tip and one glass of wine and an ice tea) it's a huge disappointment. I guess being barely busy on a Saturday night should be a big indication on what to expect..."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the service felt rush by the service asked for a drink order forced to drink warm tap water. I will not eat here again."}
{"text":"What a cute little restaurant tucked away in the pleasant town of Davidson. I dined here on a Saturday, arriving around 6:00 - just beat the crowd. When we arrived, there was literally one couple on the patio and no one inside. The place was FULL when we left. I ordered the daily special, which was a flank steak w/ mushrooms. It wasn't the best cut of meat, but had good flavor. They have large pours of wine. My sides were tasty. Unfortunately, I was unimpressed with the creme brûlée. No caramelized sugar on top. Just some whipped cream. It seemed out of place.

I tasted my friend's appetizer, brie, for the first time. Turns out, I don't like brie very much. She said it was good. I'll take her word for it. She had the pecan crusted chicken breast and enjoyed the meal. For dessert, she had the pancake with ice cream and was not a fan. 

Service was excellent, with the owner coming out to greet us. Our waitress was very patient, keeping water glasses full and was very pleasant. The staff worked as a team, which is always a sign of good service. I'm recommending Restaurant X if you're looking for something different just a short drive from Charlotte."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today. Cute little restaurant. Nice music.  Selection of entrees was very nice but only 3 choices for the kids menu, needs more.  My son loved his chicken strips kids meal though.  Said it was delicious and very filling. I had the blackened salmon Caesar salad which was great, and my husband had the surf and turf which he devoured.  I also had the house merlot which was a decent size glass, that is nice!  We ended the meal with the apple pancake.  My hubby and son devoured it!  Said it was delicious!  We will be back.  Very nice meal. Love the homemade meals here!  Recommend."}
{"text":"Best Resturant in Davidson!
Owner's Nazira & Nick are awesome and great hosts. The food is 5 star and the service is excellent.
Can't wait until the Resturant re-opens after the unfortunate Car accident!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner for first time. Parking is difficult since several restaurants close together. The service was excellent and attentive. I had crab cakes which were very good but served with a tasteless slaw and handful of fries. One of friends got burger and said bun was dry but burger itself was good.  He said could have had more fries too. My husband got penne pasta special which said was good but nothing special. Might give them another try."}
{"text":"Just a sad, sad restaurant. I went with my mother and a family friend last night and the whole experience was jut disappointing. Our first clue should have been the empty dining room at 7:30, but we decided to give it a shot despite their lack of customers. The second hint that something wasn't quite right was my beverage; I ordered sweet tea, and was surprised when it tasted like coffee. It was tea, but clearly the brew basket hadn't been cleaned between uses, creating a less-than pleasant flavor. I mentioned this to the server, who seemed more annoyed that I had a complaint than concerned that the tea wasn't good. While I stared at the dirty, empty table next to ours that hadn't been bussed in god knows how long, the appetizer arrived- the Restaurant X Double Dip- a small serving of fried pita chips, hummus, and buffalo chicken dip. The hummus was absolutely disgusting; it practically crumbled when scooped with a chip. Lord knows how old it was. The buffalo dip was slightly more edible, but nothing to write home about. Or server seemed unfazed when she cleared away a practically untouched plate; I guess they throw away a lot of uneaten food there. My mom ordered the brisket, which, other than the odd 'garnish' of a lonely cherry tomato split in half on the rim of the bowl, was decent. Our friend ordered the shepherd's pie, which looked sad but he insisted was ok. 

Overall, poor service, poor food. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"A nice place. The staff were very friendly. The food was good but I think I have had better for the money we spent. I will not say anything was bad. I had just heard such raves that I was sure I was going to be blown away. I thought  I have had better experiences for the money spent. The place is nice, not fancy.Please let me say the food was good. We had the fish special and it was tasty. I just thought it was expensive for what we got"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Try the shrimp spring rolls, seared tuna and the banoffee pie! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Only been once so far for breakfast. I had the Eggs Benedict, which was pretty good. I enjoyed the potatoes served on the side. Looking forward to trying again."}
{"text":"Restaurant X is a quaint little place that has a few tables and a simple menu. We made reservations to come here New Years Eve night for dinner. The miss' and I arrived on time at 6:00pm and were seated promptly. Our server was friendly and attentive throughout the course of the entire meal. Unfortunately the food did not live up to the service.

There are two words that come to mind when trying to describe the menu: uninspired and simple. Well, I shouldn't say that; the appetizer and dessert were spot-on awesome and the kind of stuff I would expect from a nice restaurant. However, the entrees simply do not live up to the same kind of standards for whatever reason. But let's start at the beginning. For an appetizer we shared an order of the shrimp spring rolls. These things were dynamite, as the shell was light, crisp, huge and fresh and the shrimp were cooked perfectly. The slaw and veggies that were used as a stuffing and garnish were nice and fresh, and there were also two sauces that gave a conflicting sweetness and slight spiciness. That was one heck of an appetizer!

For dinner I ordered the pork tenderloin ($17). It was extremely tender...more tender than I expected from roasted pork. It was served with a peppercorn sauce that had waaaay too many peppercorns in it. The vegetable sides were extremely boring. Mostly every dish came with mashed potatoes and a veggie medely. The mashed potatoes were fresh and creamy but nothing spectacular. The veggies were a mix of green beans and carrots and they were the worst part of the meal. I would guess that the chef simply cut up some carrots, cleaned some green beans, boiled them on the stove and then served them up. There was no flavor to them at all and it was not only disappointing but shocking. My wife ordered the special which was a grouper filet covered in a crab meat mixture ($22). The grouper was a bit dry and the crab meat was overpowered with mayo so it was extremely rich. The special came with the same ol' combo of mashed taters and meh veggies.

Then it came time for dessert. We generally don't order dessert simply because we are so stuffed from dinner, but if a place has a unique dessert listing then we will suck our guts in and split something. Despite the lacking entree menu, the dessert menu had some things on it that you wouldn't find normally...it wasn't full of cheesecake and the like. We decided to try the banoffee pie, and it was AMAZING! The pie crust is made from ginger snaps, and the main meat of the pie is simply a toffee. The pie was then topped with banana slices and whipped cream. Now toffee is something I haven't really had before (aside from a Heath bar) so it was a new and delightful experience for me. It was like caramel but better, as it wasn't as sticky or drippy. It was this perfect consistency where it was firm enough to retain shape as you cut into it (but you didn't have to saw into it) yet gave way very easily as you chewed your way to dessert bliss. This is one of the few times where I can say that a dessert blew away my entree, as I tend to be more about the meats than the sweets.

Simply put, Restaurant X was a disappointing letdown. The ambiance, appetizers and desserts scream a wonderful sophisticated dining experience yet the dinner menu is full of things that I could have found at a chain restaurant (with the quality of sides equal to that of a Ponderosa buffet spread.) I expected much more from Restaurant X, and a drop dead delicious dessert isn't enough to tempt me to go back."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out for a family brunch today.   We waited 20 minutes for the server to arrive at our table and when she finally did, she looked annoyed that we were sitting there.  She NEVER checked on us and got annoyed when we requested separate checks.  If she would have came by when we were sat, we could have explained that to her.  If it wasn't for the nice blonde woman, we would have never received water or coffee. The food was mediocre, not worth the horrible service."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of trying Restaurant X for the first time this past Sunday. What a lovely experience. Everything was perfect for a nice family Sunday brunch. Impeccable food, service and overall ambience. I highly recommend to anyone that loves a good afternoon or night out to relax, eat and enjoy life"}
{"text":"Okay I just learned that Chris and Christina have sold the restaurant! I will miss them...but the good news is that the new owners are people who were customers and they plan to keep many if the favorites (PLEASE keep the Ahi Tuna  with noodles and slaw!), so I'm optimistic that it will continue to be my first choice of local dining spots!"}
