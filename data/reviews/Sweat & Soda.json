{"text":"Great food and wonderful customer service! Loved the beet, zucchini and chicken salad and enjoyed the spicy soy dressing. The cold brew coffee was super refreshing in this hot day. The barista gave me a couple of things to try after I was asking about an iced coffee, and the cold brew was an awesome choice.   I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"GREAT place. Big, open, airy space with lots of good food and drinks (including coffee) but with the added bonus of lockers and bike racks for anyone who wants to come by post-run or ride.   My new favourite hangout in Leslieville!"}
{"text":"Very cute coffee shop and prepared foods spot. Reclaimed wood on the floors and base of the counter in a very bright room. People hang out for a while as it is inviting. Staff/owner? seem very nice. Order at the counter, they deliver to your table. The vegan (corn and bean mix with fresh veggies) sandwich and lentil soup were good. More nutritious than satisfying though. Lentil soup had a bunch of pumpkin seeds thrown in at the end. Seemed a bit more like granola than soup. But it's a great spot. According to yelp reviews, this is a hangout for running groups. They may be out running now, didn't see any this time."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a coffee and work. Food is great too, always healthy and the portions and the right size"}
{"text":"Awesome place. The staff is friendly, as is the owner, Yoona. They have super healthy, tasty options. I had the breakfast bowl (yoghurt, quinoa, chia, strawberries, blueberries, bananas and pecans) -- amazing! They are also very serious about their coffee. They use Propeller beans, and know their stuff. Kombucha and cold brewed coffee ON TAP! Really nice space, with a garage-style door, and big windows in back, bright space with Queen St. facing windows in front. Very welcoming. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Staying in the area for a week and have been to this place three times. Had the black bean burger, the  PB & Chocolate and Green smoothies. They are low key and friendly and have a place for you to refill your water bottle. The sun is great in their front room. Vegan friendly!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance. It's a beautiful place. Lots light and fresh food. My only complaint is the inability to make your own smoothie. They had a couple of smoothies listed on the menu board, but when we asked about modifications we were told it wasn't possible? If they have the blender and the ingredients and we have the money to spend, how is this not a thing? It's crazy to me that you can't make your own smoothie at a place like this!!"}
{"text":"The coffee is awful. I've tried the drip coffee and the cappuccino. The drip tastes very sour and acidic, meaning the beans were over extracted. The cappuccino was burnt and the milk curdled. 20 notches worse than McDonalds coffee. I couldn't take more than a sip. Really unfortunate, they use propeller beans so it looked promising. On the plus side, decor is cute and looked like there was lots of space for work."}
{"text":"This place is REALLY GREAT!  There are a lot of options for salad bowls.  I tried the Kombucha Berry (kombucha style sangria mocktail) and Quinoa and Chickpea salad on my first visit.  The Kombucha Berry drink actually came with some sliced strawberries and lemon which was pleasantly surprising and it tasted great of course.  The Quinoa and Chickpea salad was amazing and a lot more filling than I expected.  The bowl is actually deeply filled with a lot of quinoa, shredded lettuce, carrots, tasty mashed chickpeas, and also comes with a side of Tahini sauce.  It was honestly one of the best salad bowls I've ever had.  The hospitality here was also top quality.  I had a chat with one of the workers, Andrew.  I told him I was actually coming down with a cold and he surprised me by giving me a cup of ginger tea on the house midway through my meal.  I'll definitely be back and I'd highly recommend giving this place a try if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"The fitness cafe. A creative concept that works perfectly in Lesliville, this is a health focused coffee stop for the everyday biker or runner. The space is really open yet cozy! They also have a garage door that opens up in the summer"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere. Friendly, welcoming. Simple offerings, great quick lunch or Grab and go spot. Healthy offerings at a great price point. Great addition to queen st e"}
{"text":"This is a very beautiful space! I love the plants in the back - maybe they will grow into a living wall! Apparently, this coffee shop is geared towards cyclists and runners because they have lockers. I didn't use the lockers but I did meet my running group there.  I ordered a coffee before my run. It was good house coffee. Strong and not bitter. After my run, I ordered the breakfast wrap with soft poached eggs, potatoes and bacon and a spicy sauce. I don't like wraps (the actual wrap element), but this was a small wrap which contained very delicious food all packed together.  The staff is friendly and very helpful. In fact, they are unfazed by sweaty, flushed runners."}
{"text":"Great food - unique combinations, healthy and delicious. Great vibe - really well put together and inviting. Great coffee - done with respect and honor."}
{"text":"I tried the; ROASTED VEGETABLES & TEMPEH BOWL (Vegan)  I was completely satisfied, portion was good, just the right amount of balance and fair price. The tempeh was very unique from others that I've tried it was primarily a sunflower seed base and it was delicious. Would recommend and I'll eat there again :) Everyone I was with seemed pleased with their order and said that they would order from here again."}
{"text":"I love this spot. The space itself is very energizing, with natural light, greenery and a very relaxed atmosphere. If I worked from home, I'd definitely come here every day to work away because I find the vibes to be so inspiring!   The food is great too. Their salads are actually healthy and not just the latest craze of faux-healthy. And quite filling! They also have a filthy delicious breakfast wrap/burrito (that probably isn't healthy at all, but it's goooood!)   Overall, what I really love about this place is the environment and the friendliness of the staff. My one complaint is I wish they were open later. I'd love to come here more often, but it rarely happens because of their early closing time."}
{"text":"I'll begin by saying that the space is gorgeous and the staff is wonderfully friendly.  If I lived in the neighbourhood, I imagine I'd be caffeinating and reading the paper here quite regularly.  They have lots of healthy food offerings, in keeping with their mission to be a fitness hub.  I had their Peanut Butter & Chocolate smoothie (Natural peanut butter, oats, dates, cacao powder, banana, chia seeds, almond milk) with a shot of espresso for an extra dollar.  I love smoothies like this and have them regularly, however I was quite disappointed by the outcome.  My drink was watery, washing out much of the flavour (other than the espresso) and the mouthfeel was anything but smoothie-like.  At $6.95+ tax, I was expecting an especially yummy smoothie with a satisfying texture, but much as I was rooting for Sweat and Soda, they disappointed, hence the 2 stars.  Still, I'll probably go back for coffee because theirs really is a gorgeous space, but probably won't have a smoothie here again."}
