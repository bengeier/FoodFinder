{"text":"The course was in great shape, one of the best in Vegas and rivals Revere, although not as difficult.   The carts had a bad roof design (kept hitting clubs when putting them away) and the hand holds are directly above your head; awkward to use. They also don't hold a charge very well as we barely finished 18.  The restaurant may have good food but that's not what I experienced. I had trouble getting a simple hotdog from the person who was working the register as they did not know what they were doing; maybe they were new? Then when I got my dog it had probably been there for days as it was burnt to a crisp  Great course but bring your own food."}
{"text":"What a dump!!  Got an excellent deal online, which included green fee, cart and range balls.   Upon arriving to the course, no carts were available - but we got it right before tee off. The range has more dirt than grass, and the balls are worn completely down.  I like the layout of the course, but both tee boxes and fairways were utter crap, hitting the ball from the fairway was no advantage, holes everywhere and not much grass.  My suggestion would be to pay the extra money and play a real golf course"}
{"text":"Pace of play is extremely slow.....no real marshalling either.....so many other choices in Henderson to play. Starter is always great, along with the restaurant staff who are excellent. Our group won't be playing here again."}
{"text":"The best course I have ever played. First class service the second you walk through the door. Course was impeccably maintained with fantastic views. Club rentals exceeded my expectations and the Hummer cart was awesome. Comes Loaded with Gps, Digital score card, drink/food menus, and range finder. Finished the round in just over 4 hours. Had a nice lunch at the Slice 19 following the round. Excellent! Well worth the short trip from the strip. Thank you Chimera for helping make this trip memorable."}
{"text":"The deal I purchased online was good. Package had range balls, green fees, cart, breakfast and lunch. The course overall was nice - lots of green. The greens were in decent shape, fairways were nice, bunkers had soft sand. I would play this course again. The cart had lots of juice. The pace of play was good. The food was alright as well. eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, oj etc. Lunch I had to skip but the club house was packed so my impression was it was good."}
{"text":"Welcome to Tuscany....was a great little course in the East part of the Vegas Valley.  They do book 8 minute tee times...so if you start noon or later, you'll likely fall a bit behind if booked solid.  8 minute times are, unfortunately, becoming more a fact of life on the golf course than I'd hoped.  That said, we started a 1ish tee time about 10 minutes behind and proceeded to finish at about a 4:35 clip.  There are some great views of the valley and the greens are fairways were huge...it is a Palmer design so no surprise there.  The greens were the highlight...quick and smooth.  The rough was not very punishing but tall enough to keep a ball or two out of what would have been worse.  It was pretty well bunker but the bunkers were pleasurable to play from.  While I didn't play well, I would surely go back for some revenge.  If there is one most playable course for golfers living in or visiting the Vegas Valley, this very well could be it."}
{"text":"Played on 7/14/17.  Could tell that the course had good bones to it, but it was in horrible shape.  There were dead spot all over the course.    Staff was friendly but it was as if they weren't even expecting us to show up even though we had tee times.  Very unprepared."}
{"text":"Played the course late May and it was in great shape, no problems with the course but the marshals were out to get you for anything you are doing wrong.  We had the marshals come by every other hole and were not friendly at all. we had to go around another cart that was parked on the cart path and the sure enough they came by and warned us not to do that and that we would have to pay for there carts, WTF, so i give them a 2 not necessary for bad service but for being jerks and not leaving us alone. All and all it is a nice course I ended up shooting 2 over minus the *** that worked there, it was a good course in great shape."}
{"text":"The course is kept in great shape and is an enjoyable experience.   The problem is that it is so overbooked.  4 hours and we left after only 12 holes.  Each tee was backed up."}
{"text":"I've golfed here twice and enjoyed it both times.  Very good service.  challenging layout and well maintained."}
{"text":"This formerly was my \"go-to\" golf course when visiting Vegas every January. Since the club changed hands, it's out of my price range. This course has always penalized non-residents with a premium charge to play golf. But now, the rates are insane. A $63 extra charge for non-resident when I checked for a weekday time. You must be kidding. Before this year, I would pay $59 to play during a weekday. Now, it's anywhere from $108-$123 to play. Forget it. And I can't even consider playing this course on the weekends. Many of these Vegas courses are pricing themselves out of the market.  I loved going to this course before, but no more."}
{"text":"We decided to try this coarse yesterday. When we got there the lot was empty, 103* and the wind was ripping, the cart guy was super nice and took our bags. We went into the club house and asked for the golf now rate. This guy said he could not give us the rate. Every other coarse in Vegas will give it to you if you mention it. The fact they do not reflects on the boss's IQ. While we tried to do Golf Now I shopped and asked some questions about the clubs. The guy, the one that had not washed his hair for a week, was rude and put out that he had to stop watching TV to answer. I got my wife and we went to LV national where everyone was professional and had a good time. To many nice courses in LV to put up with these people."}
{"text":"Played Chimera Wednesday, March 1. As always the course was in fantastic condition. Other things were disturbing though. Many of the golf carts that they had were temporary, as we were told, because they were loaners from the company that was going to supply them with new ones. Our group got two of those temporary carts. Though their regular carts were fully equipped with course GPS, etc., ours had no towels, no golf tees, no score card, no sand bottle, no windshield and, of course, no GPS... And we payed the same price. All that did not make me happy."}
{"text":"Hit or miss, depending on who's doing the cooking we have had experiences from non cooked pizza to great meals. The front staff is great, friendly and attentive, kitchen needs to get better, consistency from the kitchen is not to be expected. Lately there's been a sewer smell when you first enter the place."}
{"text":"Fun course to play.  A good course for different skill levels.  Played in Feb. and the course was in great condition.  Good elevation changes.  The holes kind of start to seem alike for some reason.  You really have to hit it poorly to get into trouble.  9 and 18 greens are surrounded by water and are the only greens with a difficult approach shot.  I paid $65 through golfnow.com, don't think it was worth that much but I had a good time.  They do need a real clubhouse.  The staff was helpful and nice to me."}
{"text":"I have played three rounds of golf during my visits to Las Vegas. Chimera Golf Club was the nicest course I have played while visiting, and funny enough was the cheapest. We had a foursome and paid $44/ea via GolfNow! Chimera is about 20 minutes away from the strip and tucked away into a gated community. The course had extremely dark green fairways, which was impressive for this time of year. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for the best budget golf in Vegas."}
{"text":"First time playing here since the name change. The course was in excellent shape. The pro shop staff was friendly. The cart guys were energetic. Pace of play was pretty slow that day. The bar was great, with great food. Tracy, our server, was incredible."}
{"text":"Great course. I love golfing here since I live so close. The course itself is beautiful. The girls who work in the bar are extremely friendly and nice. The guys who run the driving range are petty cool guys. The marshal seems like he hates his job and very pushy. But the worst are the guys who work the pro shop. Extremely rude and also seem like they hate their jobs! Why work there is you don't like being there? For example when I went to sign up (give them business and money) I felt like I was playing 29 questions with the guy just to get him to tell me the rates for a membership. Me \"what are your rates to sign up?\" Him \"what rates?\" Me to sign up for a membership.\" Him \"memebership??\" Me \"the rates for a membership to golf here.\" Him \"what do you mean by rates for a membership?\" This type of conversation went on for about 5 minutes..."}
{"text":"Great looking course, especially for Dec. Like the whole package of breakfast/lunch/2 beers/cart/round of golf. Fairways amazingly green and lush, greens were very nice.  Range balls were bad though. Very old and some cracked open."}
{"text":"absolutely gorgeous course, fairways and greens were in fantastic shape.  the views were amazing and the range balls were free with a tee time.  the price is fantastic too, can't ask for much better when visiting Vegas.  I highly recommend it.  The only downside, is it was slow but that was on group in front of us that was terrible."}
{"text":"The pizza joint they put in is a joke.. just like the bar.. personal service is horrible.. the cooks have zero common sense and have no idea what their doing or their just lazy and incompetent... goodluck with that I really hope your able to get it together..."}
{"text":"I'm a local here and play Tuscany quite often. Great course and always in great shape. Makes for a fun forgiving round. One of my favorites in town"}
{"text":"Chimera does it again ! 8:16 t-time 1/2 hour delay. Why ? Certainly no frost delay. It's 85 Degrees. They continue to screw everyone.  Very rude personnel."}
{"text":"I played 18 today and loved it. The course is fun and in fantastic shape. I was fortunate to get paired up with some solid guys who were helpful and personable. I am going to play here every time I come to Nevada. I never once said I wish the course had or did this bla bla bla, My hat off to the staff and patrons."}
{"text":"Great place for golf and restaurant service. A coffee bar that opens 6am even on Sundays! Take out and pizza delivery, good service, good menu. Everything is remodeled and totally improved so ignore negative reviews; just see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Well I have not played here since the name change and shame on me, what a great round. The course was very well kept and played beautifully. It was good to see that work is being done and although we did not have lunch the dining area was sparkling and resembled a hip diner. It was one of those days where the Vegas temperature stayed under a 100 degrees so for golfing that is always good. The staff , as always, was cordial and helpful, Kenna was wonderful. We will be coming back with a foursome for another great round."}
{"text":"1st break in the rule of no 3 stars.   I think I have some good feedback.    Course / Conditions: The layout is as described, not too tough for the hacker, but the tee boxes and adding yardage ramp the course up.   #9 and #18 are great holes with water caries on each.  18 is one of the toughest for shorter hitters.   I am not long and from the 2nd tees back hit in to 9 on my first pass at the course, but in 3 rounds (on either hole) that was the sole time I went for it.   The back nine from 15 in to 18 were my favorite layouts.  Greens in good shape, fairways pretty nice, just a few chunky spots.  Clubhouse / Staff: A negative here was that on the first of the 3 rounds, there were just 10 tee boxes set up.  I went to practice some chips and came back 15 minutes prior to my tee time and no spots were available on the range.   They had more blocks and balls, but would not open any up.  Balls were also so beat up, not vice like most ranges.  The tees also hardly had any grass to hit off, they needed to be moved, but they chuckled when I mentioned this.  Staff in Pro Shop were nice.  Pace: Biggest gripe was this!   On first round for nearly the entire day, had to wait 5 minutes on each tee.   Come on now, 8 minutes for each group will do this on a busy day.   Would have been a 4 star review had this been better.  Slope Rating: I think a bit high, but perhaps my first round (6000ish yards - 123 slope) of the 3 was an anomaly.   I could not come close the last two rounds.  I played the 2nd set back on 1st round, then the Lilla 6500 ones the 2nd and 3rd rounds.      Would I go again, yep.   Worth the price, yes, got a deal through Golfnow and it was fair."}
{"text":"I have to agree with much of the review written by Stephen M. I played at Tuscany this past Sunday. I arrived at the course, and the employee at the cart barn tells me they are out of carts...how does a golf course run out of carts?? It shows that they are having some serious issues with overbooking and trying to squeeze in too many people. Anyway, a cart does eventually surface just before I tee off...only there is no ice in the cooler. I ask the employee and he says they are out of ice...and that the restaurant is out of ice as well. So you are sending people out on the course with no ice...on a day when it's 105 degrees. How do you run out of ice when you have many groups that still are going to play for the day? It boggles the mind.   Once out on the course, we came to realize that there was no water in the coolers by some of the holes. What's the point of having those out there if nobody is going to refill them? Is it to tease the golfers? \"Ha ha, it's fucking hot and you guys don't have any water or ice to keep your drinks cold\" Yeah, great way to piss people off. As if the whole water/ice fiasco wasn't enough, the pace of play was atrociously slow. The guy I was paired up with and I were waiting for 10+ minutes on every hole on the first nine holes. There's something wrong when it takes a twosome over 3 hours to get through the front nine. I think they do their tee times 7 minutes apart, and it's nowhere near enough time.   The course itself is actually really fun. You get range balls included, a cart with gps, and a course that is in pretty good condition and is fun to play. There are many interesting holes, and the closing 18th hole is great. But why would anyone come here just to spend more time standing around than you do playing? So you can watch three other groups tee off while you stand around in 105 degree weather drinking your warm Powerade? With so many other golf options in Vegas, I wouldn't come back here again. They need to fix the major issues they have before they start losing more customers."}
{"text":"Fun course to play regardless of skill level. Decent prices most of the time. I would give it four stars, but they try to pack as many golfers as possible on the course. Sign up for their email list to get the best deals."}
{"text":"Course is in great condition, fairways and greens are perfect. Today I played a Twilight round, the course is definitely busy, we teed off at 3:20 and played 15 holes.  One of the most picturesque courses in town."}
{"text":"3 stars my ass...Ive played 20 different tracks in Las Vegas including Arroyo, Revere, Bears Best, Badlands and Desert Pines, and for the money, Chimera @ Tuscany could be for the DOLLAR, my favorite one.  This was the 3rd time i have this course and it was absolutely pure and pristine..the tee box, fairways and greens which were fast but not crazy. Nice layout. Wide but not easy. Lots of rolling hills.    Staff in clubhouse and near range were very cordial and friendly. The rack rate is ridiculous but you can find this course for under $45 at a number of sites.  I paid $36 for a 128pm tee time on a Tuesday in May via www.teeoff.com. That site if you follow on social media always has promo codes. Hence, i paid $30. There isnt a course in America better than Chimera for $30. We played with a Foursome in 4hrs, 10 mins. Not so bad.  It is a 26-32 min ride from Mid Strip but totally worth it. Like Rhodes Ranch, this track never disappoints.  I will play it on each trip to Vegas. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"thanks to this golf course, now i can't play at my reg LA public courses.  THANKS ALOT.  this place is a heaven, well the overcast weather did help!  as for service, i didnt deal with anyone except the lady at the bar inside and she was super nice!"}
{"text":"The bartender Rachel is super rude. She told me I can go to another bar. Wow really? I live in the community and a lot of us like going there. I'd rather go when she's not working. Unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"Brought my two sons to vegas for a golf weekend. This course was so much fun. Nice wide fairways and literally every person we encountered who worked there was courteous and helpful. I loved it. Eric Hoagland in the pro shop took care of us like family. We will be back."}
{"text":"I'd probably give this place 5 stars once the new clubhouse is built. But miles far from the strip in outer Henderson is the Tuscany Golf Club. It's places in a incomplete housing development which, when finished, is going to look absolutely sublime.  As for the course, it is in impeccable condition. A resort course that has plenty of tees for all skills, is very easy to play and has huge fairways and easy greens to hit into. What I love about this course is the fact it is a Vegas course. One where you can make bets: plenty of Par 5's, drivable Par 4's and a great 18th hole, over a water hazards, just in case you have any press bets.  The course does run through a housing project, and you are somewhat close to a few houses for a few holes. But the houses don't cause much of a nuisance. This is a fun course to play, it's easy to score. But a word of warning: watch out for the wind. It picks up here pretty hard!"}
{"text":"Tomato soup, grilled cheese, tuna melt.....all delish!! Best cosmo! Taco Tuesday is fun! Cheap tacos, cheap margaritas!!"}
{"text":"I would love to give this course 4 or 5 stars, but there are just a few issues this course is having. The last 3 rounds I've played here, I've played 5 to 5 and a half hour rounds. They're clearly packing the course too much, or they're stacking tee times too closely together. Id rather pay $5-$10 more and play a round here that I wasnt waiting 15 minutes on every tee box.  As far as course conditions, AMAZING! One of the best in town. The player services guys, great customer service. I remember a guy named Kyle and Andy helped me, good guys.  Just wish they'd have a little better time management skills here."}
{"text":"I'm rounding up here.... as I would like to give them a 3.5 stars.  It's a really nice course (better than Legacy, not as nice as Rio Secco).  They get 2 stars for the Trailer which is the golf shop/restaurant which has been that way since... I got here 4 years ago.  I guess \"the economy\" isn't helping... BUT... they always seem to be booked... busy... lots of golfers... whenever we go (which granted isn't all that frequently.. but still.)  LOCATION: 3 stars It's in BFE... on your way to Lake Las Vegas... so if you live in Summerlin or NLV... this is going to be a hike.    For me ... from GVR... it's a quick hop, skip and a jump... 20 minutes.  COURSE: 4 stars Played it less than 2 weeks ago and it was in really good shape. Surprisingly ... as I thought maybe with it being \"winter\" and the \"bad economy\" the management might \"let it slide\".  But Thankfully, they did not and it looks great and the greens while on the fast side (what isn't in Vegas) are not filled with pock marks.  The fairways are green and well kept.  The roughs don't look like weeds... and are mostly forgiving... sort of.  Hand wedge works every time if you need to.  I managed to find almost every fairway bunker... so I can't remember having a favorite hole.  Beware of goose poop on #9, #17, #18.  BEV CART: 4 stars The gal made a GREAT Bloody Mary.  :)  If you're local, sign up for their e-mail ... and you'll get Special Pricing. And if you work \"in the industry\"... aka casinos... you get even better pricing but you have to let them know when you make the reservation. And I think it's only good 24 hours in advance.  But ask when you call to make a tee time."}
{"text":"Such a nice course. Both times I've gone, the course was perfect. Fairways and greens are so well kept. Best part is I paid $30 to play. Fairly wide open course with a few well placed hazards. Only problem I have with this course is that it's pretty far from my house. But worth the drive for sure. Compared to Bali hai and rio seco, Tuscany was way nicer and for way less."}
{"text":"Great crew, course was in great shape, every lie was perfect. The greens were a lil bumpy, but thats just because lazy people don't fix theyre ball marks. Hot dog at the the turn was delish and delivered with a smile. I will come back soon!"}
{"text":"Pro Shop staff and cart people were polite and attentive. Driving range was decent, hit from mats not grass. Nunzio the starter needs to go back to customer service 101. I ran in to the restaurant to grab a quick clif bar and there were no employees in the restaurant or bar area to pay. I waited 5 minutes looking for someone and heard someone in the kitchen so I walked backed there. Kitchen staff started looking for front house staff and was also unsuccessful. I left $2 on the register and went outside. Nunzio was crabbing about me needing to tee off and he was also hassling our foursome. I explained to him what caused the delay and he then bowed down and with a smart ass grin and directed me to the tee box pointing in the general direction. We've been playing this course for years on a regular annual trip and starters have  always been a PITA here. I think we are done with this course..."}
{"text":"Dog Track.  One of the worse courses I've played and after reading the reviews it must be a just us eh?    We played as non-residents, when we called for reservations we didn't think to ask about the conditions but the ProShop should have given a heads up or offered a discount on the green fees.  We found out they were 2 weeks away from overseeding but already the course has gone to shhhit - maybe they're rationing the water here with the drought but at times it was like hitting out of an alley way or stuck in mud (in the fairway!).  It DID NOT look like the pictures on the website.  Staff were lethargic and unresponsive - why have 5 guys standing around at the tent if they're not going to wipe clubs, get a cart or provide even a towel to cool off.  On the front 9 we didn't see a cart girl - we saw her once on the back.   We took our time teeing off since there wasn't anyone behind or after us, but we soon caught up with a group of 3 - even after skipping a hole to get a head, there were several other groups playing at a snails pace with no push from the marshal.  It's called Ready Golf - I don't want to spend 5 and half hours in 95 degree heat when there's only 25 people playing on the course.  Insane.   I will say there's some nicely laid out holes and if the course wasn't brown and chopped up - there could have been a better time.  Regardless I won't be back and it won't be on my recommendations list next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The only thing good about this golf course is the course itself.  Its really a nice looking course.  But that's about it...  Ive been playing here for several months.  Here's what I have experienced at Tuscany.... They over book pretty much everyday, even weekdays.  They let employees \"squeeze in\" in between tee times.  They front load the course.  you can expect to see 3 or 4 groups on a hole at one time.  There is no Marshall to maintain pace of play.  Ive seen a Marshall maybe twice in a dozen rounds...  All he does is drive around and tell you that its slow today, if he stops at all. A 5+ hour round is standard. There will not be cold water in the coolers on the course once the ice melts around 11am. They do not refill them or put more ice in throughout the day.  You will not get a wet towel to clean your clubs, and the cart guys will most likely tell you they ran out of ice.  They do not have enough carts to support their over booking.  We've been 15 minutes late for our tee time, waiting for a group to finish so we could use that cart.   Holes 10 and 16 (surrounding the driving range) are always littered with range balls.  Ive played with guys who specifically keep a yellow ball, so they can find their ball.   Just today, Sunday afternoon, they turned people away from the driving range because they ran out of balls.  The range tender told me that \"a bunch of guys showed up too early for their tee time, and hit too may balls.  So we don't have anyone to go pick them up\"  I couldnt believe what I heard, I had to just laugh.    It really is pathetic how this course is ran.  The manager, if there even is one, doesnt care, or is completely oblivious.  Do not pay to play here.  there are much better courses in vegas."}
{"text":"SLOW PACE OF PLAY ALERT!!!!!!  Tuscany is one of my favorite courses to play here in Vegas, but after the last few rounds taking over 5 hours I am gonna pass on it until management gets their head out of the sand. On top of that, the customer service needs to be polished up as well.  Today, we got our carts and the cart guy told us that we can drive down the 1st tee. We get there, and who I believe is the starter is down there. So, this is the 1st problem. The starter is at the box. He should be back at the cart barn regulating when people head off to the 1st hole. Instead, they are just shoveling people down there.  I asked him, \"Are you the starter?\" He says, \"You got your ticket?\"  I ask him again....\"Are you the starter???\" I think he nodded his head. Guy can barely answer my question.  There is a group in the fairway and the green is clear. I'm thinking that we may actually get a 3-4 hour round in today.  We tee off at 2:47 sharp. I checked my phone when we got into the carts after teeing off. We finish the hole and then the nightmare begins at #2 tee box.  There is a group of 4 waiting to tee off. Another group of 3 waiting for them. Then, there is a group in the fairway and another group on the green. Including us, this hole is 5 groups deep!! The food cart girl drives right by us and doesn't say a word. What the heck???  At 3:10, I call the pro shop. \"Hey, were out here on #2 and it's 5 groups deep over here. Is there any way you can send a marshal out here so he can figure out what the problem is? The pace is incredibly slow.  He says, \"Ya, I know it's pretty busy out there today, but I send someone over there.\"  Didn't say sorry or apologize or anything. Didn't call me sir.  It takes us 55 minutes to finish 3 holes. My buddy calls the pro shop and basically gets the same treatment. He asks the guy how long they space the groups apart. The guy says, \"7 and a half minutes.\" He then tells my friend that the industry standard is 8 and a half minutes.  We see a marshal on #4 when we are at the tee box. He drives right by and says nothing, but the folks behind us are now caught up to us. He decides to have a chat with them. We can over-hear them talking.  \"Sorry about the pace being so slow today. It opens up a little bit later, but the next 6-7 holes are just like this.\"  Great......the rest of the front nine is jam packed.  We finish hole #7 at 5;10 and then say screw it!! 2 hours 23 minutes for 7 holes!!! We pass everyone and head back to #1 where it's wide open. We play 1-9 and get off the course at 6:33.  Bottom line......If you tee off after 1:30 at Tuscany you will not be able to finish in daylight. They cram as many people as they can onto the course and don't regulate any of it."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by how well it's kept. Clean and friendly staff. Fairways are in excellent condition."}
{"text":"I have played allot of courses in Vegas but his one was the in the best condition I have ever played. Clubhouse and pro shop id below average but I don't go golfing for that. I payed $25 for twilight 18, cart, and range...great price for a nice track plus booked online and got 2 free beers."}
{"text":"I enjoy playing at Tuscany. It is one of Las Vegas' newer golf courses. My first time at Tuscany - the Club house was in a converted quonset hut / tent.  They now sport a beautiful club house and restaurant. The club initially had some problems growing grass in  this arid part of Vegas, so the team from Rhodes Ranch came in took it over and the course has been blooming ever since.  Rhodes Ranch is the \"sister\" course and you can often get supurb package deals for plying both courses. The course is well laid out with a number of sand traps that seem to play right to my driving distance.  There is enough water on the course to splash a few misplaced shots The course winds past the beautiful stone clocktower has spacious fairways. The theme of the course centers around wine and vineyards making it fairly unique. I think this is an excellent course for the price you pay.  You have to drive a bit further than some of the Summerlin courses but it is a super experience."}
{"text":"This sister course to Rhodes Ranch, this golf course is tucked near Lake Las Vegas.  Thankfully, it hasn't suffered the same fate as the Lake Las Vegas courses....it's managed to stay open during the recession.  Here are my thoughts on this course:  Pros - It's both a fun and challenging course.  The fairways aren't too tight, but some holes have the appearance as if they are narrower than they actually are.  - The course is in good shape most of the time.  - The rates are great for the type of golf course you get to play on.  Cons - It's location is far from my house & the Strip.  Unless you live in Green Valley or Henderson, it's a drive.  - There is no permanent clubhouse.  Unfortunately, it never got completed.  There were plans to do it, but with the economy tanking, it's on hold for a while I'm sure.  - Because there isn't a permanent clubhouse, the food is served out of a snack bar type restaurant.....the food quality isn't good.  - The driving range can get cramped, especially if there are lessons being held and it's the weekend.  Overall, I rate this place 3 Stars....if they had a permanent facility and better food, I might bump it up to 4 Stars.  Will I return?  Next time I feel like driving to Egypt to play golf, sure."}
{"text":"As you can see, do not make it a point to review places or experiences but after playing golf out here yesterday felt obligated.  The course just came out of oversees, everything was green and plush.  Going to make a point to get back out there in a couple weeks when they can now the fairways and greens just a little tighter!  Great round regardless. While the golf course was in good shape and looked great, the star of the show was the people.  Good guys in the shop, attentive kids outside and Slice 19 really is a cool little place to eat before or after your round or stop in a grab a beer anytime..  had all the MLB playoff games on late afternoon.  Star of the show was the most polite and delightful young lady roaming the course as the cart girl (sorry, never thought to ask her name to give a shout out). Last, one minor annoyance was the guy parked on the  par 3 6th tee... maybe do away with the game, or at the very least ask him to stop smoking cigarettes. The  smell of his cancer sticks was the lone blip on a really fun day."}
{"text":"Fantastic course! It was a fun, but not overly difficult layout. The fairways were wide and the greens not too slick. The course was in amazing shape and the staff super friendly!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service.  No greeting for front desk staff.  Casey, the cart/range person poor attitude, not helpful, and lazy.  The guy behind the deli/grill area where they serve food, no greeting, I had to interrupt him from his flirting escapade with another female employee to get some service.  Not a high end staff.  Great course though.  However don't pay top dollar to play.  1st time experience here.  Not impressed a bit.  Cart died, i told another cart guy on the turn, he said he would trade it out for another, forgot  about me and ended up finishing my round walking."}
{"text":"I would have rather given zero stars, but alas, yelp does not allow it.  This review is purely from a customer service point of view since I was never able to play the course.  I booked a tee time for two people about a month in advance at about 2 p.m. for a Thursday in March.  My business partner and I were arriving from different cities in the morning of our tee time and would have plenty of time to make a meeting we had and then head out to the golf course.  Well, my partners flight was delayed and then eventually cancelled and he would not be arriving in Las Vegas until almost 6 P.M.  I called Tuscany at 8:20 in the morning to explain what happened and the person on the phone didn't even ask me any questions like \"Would you like to reschedule?\", he simply told me that he would charge my card for the two green fees and I should have a nice day.  Look, I understand that they have a 24 hour cancellation notice, but I also run a business and I know that you have to look at each case with a little something called logic.  I sent an email to the management of the Tuscany Golf Club and never received a response.  The only thing I saw from them was the charge on my credit card the next day.    Funny thing is that my partner snagged a seat on an earlier plane and even though I already had \"paid\" for our round at Tuscany, we just fit in 18 at Bali Hai and then the next day at Royal Links and spent a ton on drinks and pro shop gear (I needed a new three wood).    Thanks Tuscany Golf Club!!  Not."}
{"text":"I've played this course several times over the years and there seems to be an issue with overbooking. Each time we play, there is a delay on every single hole although the course conditions are pretty nice having the wait that amount of time is absolutely ridiculous . In addition to the delay on each hole the cart girls were scarce,  to be once inside the clubhouse the service was equally disappointing. If you're an avid golfer you would enjoy the course if you can just get a chance to play a legitimate round without the delays."}
{"text":"Where do I start ? What a disappointment . Not worth the drive or the money. There are no carts avail till your tee time so no putting prior to your round . The starter is an IDIOT ! We told him our name 3 times & he said oh follow that group .. Ok then 5 mins later he said oh you are playing with that group that already tee off meet them on next hole ?? Really ?? So we missed the first hole. Pace was not great waiting on holes & hello !! Women play this game too ! I only saw one woman my wife ! Way over cooked got hot dogs .. We will not return !"}
{"text":"I'm very sad to say that I'm giving this course a bad review. I would have listed this as a 1 star but the greens were well kept and the course was in good shape for now (Which would have been enjoyable if we could actually play the course. See below).  Let me first start with the positive, and that is the course was very nicely maintained and looked picturesque.  So there's that.  Ok, so I'm a local and was invited out with my coworkers to play this course for the first time.  First thing I will say is that the staff sucked. The clubhouse clerk had the demeanor that he didn't give a s**t about anything, which was really off putting to start things off.  The starter clerk and the golf cart clerk were the same. This is a golf course not a Denny's you guys. Step up your manners please.  What ever, just get me on the course and it'll be ok right? Wrong! Let me start by saying that I have never seen a course SO OVERBOOKED in my life! Our tee time was a twilight keep in mind. They were backed up by 3-4 groups every hole. At hole #4 I counted 17 people on one hole! 17!! 4 people on the green, 4 people on the fairway, 4 on the tee box, 2 waiting in cue, then my party of 3. Unacceptable! UNACCEPTABLE! We finished 9 holes in 3 hours and 45 mins then went back to the club house to file our feedback. When my coworker tried complaining about the overbooking, he was told by the clerk in a condescending manner, \"that's why they call it a twilight.\"  That was enough to send us walking out and never returning. I will never recommend this course to any of my clients or friends. Sorry guys."}
{"text":"Came for a golf trip with my golf buddies. This course is in superb condition. I was amazed at the low price for a course in this condition.im from monterey california and this course would be in the top 10 there. The ladies in the restaurant were friendly. The only negative was the rude guy with the glasses that works in the pro shop."}
{"text":"Chimera delivered a great round of golf. Reasonably priced and worth the money.  Wonderful big and challenging greens, deep bunkers all well maintained. Nice club house with bar and rcs with good food. Staff very friendly. Course is challenging but fair if you keep it in play. Fully recommend."}
{"text":"Love the course but I was pretty pissed that the lawn mowers were in our way pretty much the entire day. We had to keep waiting on them.. they also are up three of our balls. When I spoke to the staff about it they didn't really seem to care. It was kinda disrespectful."}
{"text":"Beautiful course I don't care which hole is supposed to be the signature 18 is my favorite. Great selection in the pro shop and really friendly staff. At 50 bucks is really a good deal compared to other courses that are the same price like green valley this course tops that easily. All the fairways are green and well kept and is in a great spot out of town for you and your friends to go out and enjoy a nice round of golf."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! This used to be such a sad course out in the middle of nowhere. Now it is a gem. Great conditions, reasonable rates, and a more vibrant community surrounding the course make this a awesome excuse to hit the links.  I have played it a few times now, the last being over two years ago, but they have really done a great job at making Tuscany one of the best courses in town.  The only drawback was the slow pace of play with no marshall and the bunkers were not very good, i.e., no sand in some of them. Everything else was top notch, though. The fairways, tee boxes, greens, and rough were all very green and lush especially by Las Vegas standards."}
{"text":"Tuscany is a fun course to play! I am always scoping out a great golf deal in Vegas in the summer. I play at 3pm in the summer. who cares if it's 107!? After about 3pm it's 19$ for a round that includes range balls, a cart with GPS, and two beers or sodas from the clubhouse. You really can't beat that price and the golf is great, too!  You should also know that Tuscany has an Iphone app. You can set up an account and make T-times right from your phone. They are on the way to Lake Las Vegas, but  not that far so stop whining and go whack a par! Now get out there and golf!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this golf course, it is infested with Nats every hole every shot you are shoeing away the insects instead of concentrating on your game. Also for $60 and yes that is local rate you would expect at least one bottle of water in the cooler. And the cart girl did not show up until the 16th hole. You can keep this nasty golf course with the nasty insects in old Henderson"}
{"text":"rough, fairways, and greens plush and immaculate.    good speed on greens."}
{"text":"Great course.  Way too many golfers. Hit and wait on every hole. Played 16 holes in 5 hours and walked off the course when our cart died. Thanks but no thanks.  Will never play this course on a weekend ever again."}
{"text":"Chimera has been my go to course while in Las Vegas . The staff is very helpful and pleasant. The course was in good shape , understandably a little over grown due to the overseeding . I do have to say you can't beat the price !! I will continue to head to this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"This course falls short of some of most of the other courses I've played in the Vegas area. It feels like they ran out of money to build nice facilities. Unfortunately, the staff was pretty awful as well so it's hard to find many reasons to come back here..  *The clubhouse (if you will) is a trailer. The snack bar is a dirty grungy room in a trailer.. with rude staff and high prices.  *No bottled water provided *We stood around awkwardly for 20 minutes after our tee time (after asking 3 staff for help) before we were finally given some sort of instruction. It seemed the guys working here were more interested in modeling their ray bans than they were about working or helping out. \"Can we get a cart to put our bags on\" \"um no\", \"ok our tee time was 10 minutes ago, when can we start\" \"no clue\", etc. UGH *The course it self is a big yawn. As a beginner, playing on a very easy course was nice, but it lacked any sort of challenge and interesting features. I find playing at the little executive course, Desert Willow, more exciting than playing here.   Overall not such a great experience. The course was pretty well kept, so they get points for that. If the staff wasn't so damn rude, they'd get 3 stars."}
{"text":"Decent golf course, but the help on the course and some players make the place not worth paying for the greens.  When you're out enjoying some time away from work, the family, and just life... you want to do it at a leisure pace.  So it doesn't make your tee time enjoyable when a \"red shirt\" asks you and your group to hurry up.  We can only go as fast as the group in front of us... not our fault that you may have overbooked.   For this reason, we most likely won't be returning to this slightly above average course."}
{"text":"It was an absolutely wonderful time at the Monday Night Football event. The chicken wings and the sliders were awesome. The beer is cold and there are tv's everywhere.  Lots of different style seating available. Comfortable couches and chairs, high top and low top tables or if you prefer a bar stool. Great atmosphere. Apparently I have some really awesome neighbors. But you do not have to be a resident of Tuscany to enjoy the golf Clubhouse restaurant and bar. They serve breakfast lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I took a golf lesson from Mike. He got right down to my swing and coaching me what I needed to do to correct it. It was only A half hour lesson, but at the conclusion, I was shifting my weight and keeping my head down, and releasing. I will practice a few days and come back for my fine tuning."}
{"text":"Now I'm specifically speaking about the bar  The pig wings were absolutely unbelievable. Seriously well mixed great and fantastic cut of meat and seasoned well. The server was not afraid to ask if we needed anything and the ambiance was neat clean and what one would expect of a golf pro shop. Should I ever find myself in the area again I will not forget to stop on by and have another item. Unbelievable out of this world quality and amazing service."}
{"text":"The golf course was beautiful!!  But I don't play golf.  I was attending a tournament with friends.  The food is. well, not good.  The sandwiches made for this event were horrible and the macaroni salad was dry.  I don't believe they used more than 2 tablespoons of mayo in the entire serving bowl!  The cheese used on the sandwiches was that processed cheese food you see in the supermarket!  You know, the kind wrapped din a piece of plastic!  Better food at a fast food place would have been better!!"}
{"text":"We played Chimera Golf Club today, and we were very disappointed. We live in Las Vegas and have played most of the courses here. The course conditions at Chimera were the worst we have ever played. The fairways had very little grass. It was so bad that we played lift, clean and place in the fairways. There were times we couldn't even find grass to place our ball in. We received no discount for the conditions and felt that even if they had reduced the rate we still would not have played. What made it worse was that there were no prior notifications letting us know about the conditions. Most of the golfers in our league stated that they would not play there again. Neglected course."}
{"text":"really a great course, nice routing and solid layout. aside from the cart attendandant being really nice, the outside staff were hitting balls when we were finished without offering assistance with are clubs, not to mention, no water on the golf course to drink, its a 108 out guys, come on!  people appear rather complacent here and that is not good. that includes management too!!!"}
{"text":"A late Wednesday afternoon round of golf. First time I've ever played this course. Finished in 4 hours, even with some waiting on the last 5 holes.  Course is in excellent condition. Has a few great views, especially #2 tee looking toward the Strip. Not a lot of water in play and generous fairways. Lots of houses along the course so you do have to keep it fairly straight, and the houses do mess with your ability to judge the wind. This was a windy day.  Practice facilities are ok, driving range with grass and mats, small chipping green, and a smallish putting green located a ways away near #1 tee.   The grill room looks nice, I only stopped for a couple of beers to take out on the course. Fairly large seating area and some patio seating as well, good for large groups. Pro shop was under some construction but they have the typical fare, shirts, hats, etc.   Enjoy your round of golf here. Kudos to the Superintendent and his staff for the immaculate conditions."}
{"text":"My favorite course.  Great people.  Great food.  Anyone giving this less than 4-stars is crazy."}
{"text":"What a nice golf course ! Really enjoy the manicured and green ! Come back again if I will be in Las Vegas"}
