{"text":"Good food; Gyro sauce was great.  The food comes from local distributors.  The server was very nice."}
{"text":"Ordered take out for the first time, Philly cheese steak and a Gyro.  Both include these big, fresh cut fries that are pretty good.  The Philly cheese steak was decent but nothing to write home about.  Unfortunately the Gyro was the worst I've ever had.  If you're going to have a restaurant with Greek food you better have outstanding Gyro.  The meat which is typical Gyro cone  meat was tasteless!  It tasted and had the texture of a boiled, soggy meatball with no spices.  The Garlic sauce which is used on Shawarma not gyro was like water.  My opinion, the Asian/Greek concept is not going to work."}
{"text":"Amazing food, Its all fresh and the portions are large. The owner personally comes to your table An explains why it's Asian/Greek, very sweet woman. Can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"Went in on Saturday Evening there were a few patrons already, The staff were extremely helpful but a little difficult in communicating due to an understanding of English,  I and my companion ordered an appetizer, I the seafood rangoon from the Asian menu and my companion from the Greek menu, both came to the table hot and were just o.k. For the main meal my companion ordered the gyro platter, but was disappointed as the gyro meat was        extremely bland and tough and lacking in the sauce. I ordered the Mushroom Ravioli. The flavor of the basil sauce overpowered the mushroom ravioli so mush so I had to remove the sauce to eat the ravioli. All in all the restaurant lacked the wow factor in the food and it was just mediocre   They should defiantly rethink there menu. I would not go there again."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at this restaurant.  The food was excellent and the owner is extremely pleasant and helpful.  She was so willing to do anything you would like to make the food just as you like it.  This was our first visit but we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ate here last night, the owners are extremely kind and interested in how they can improve asking for any comments, portions are very generous and food qualify is excellent. I had the pad thai with chicken and my girlfriend had the pho, both dishes were absolutely delicious. They also have a huge selection of bubble tea's, we had the mango and the coconut and both were great. We will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"We had a really great experience. The owners are very friendly and provide awesome service and great food.  We had the egg rolls, Szechuan beef, Teriyaki chicken, and General Tso chicken. They use local meat from Duma's and other local ingredients. Nice little Restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing fresh food and the best service I've had. No MSG with locally sourced veg and meats from notable Dumas meats. Something for everyone on the dual menu - I got Asian this time. Egg rolls are packed with chicken and 3 to an order. Spicy Noodles had subtle heat and great depth. My son's chicken tenders and fries were a stand out in kids cuisine! Normally you get frozen planks but not here! Fresh cut fries and breast cut and dredged in a crunchy coating. One child eats free with each adult order on Tuesdays ppl! Get here and steal your kids dinner!!!"}
{"text":"The Pad Thai and all the Curry's are phenomenal. The flavor profiles are authentic. Probably the best Thai food I've found in Northeast Ohio area. Highly recommend trying as you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant is such a find, I almost hate to share for fear it will get too crowded!  Seriously delicious food, cooked beautifully and just the right amount of spice.  Very generous portions, and they have always accommodated my special requests.  Servers are sweet, very attentive but not too much, and from my first visit they remember names and which dishes we like.  Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I try to visit a new restaurant each time I visit my kid at KSU. Good service, great attitude, very busy!  I vote for the nachos and the red curry duck!"}
{"text":"Great food with exceptional service. One of the better thai restaurants in Stow. The restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"Got their spicy noodles with chicken. Really liked what I got. Wanna go back sometime soon to try other stuff. Hope this business finds success!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!! This place is so yummy!! They just opened 3 weeks ago and I will be back many times!! We tried their coconut and mango bubble tea! It was delicious and very fairly priced! The chicken pho and chicken pad Thai were both amazing as well as their Cambodian nachos!! Portions are huge!! The staff is so nice and restaurant is very clean! I was blown away by the quality and service!"}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall is my favorite Thai place I have been to by far! As a connoisseur of Asian foods, I enjoyed coming to Bangkok more than I can even describe! The outside is very tiny but the inside is surprisingly big - the owners greet you at the front door with a big smile and a friendly attitude. They are fairly popular, which makes the fact that they know each new person that comes through the door that much cooler, so it's nice to see lots of regulars who frequent the restaurant.   I ordered Chicken Pad Thai, Fried Rice, and a Rice-Wrapped Spring Roll (my go-to when trying a new Thai place) and HOLY COW! It was absolutely delicious. It did not take long at all to receive my food, and they have a surplus of different condiments to choose from at the table for any sort of extra flavor you would like.   Honestly, if I could give them more than 5 stars I absolutely would. It is a must-try restaurant if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"This is no longer the Greek / Asian combination restaurant... ignore those reviews... not sure why they are included here... that place is long gone from this location.  Crab Rangoon is anazing... generous,filling with green onion and tiny carrot bits... great flavor  Fried dumplings are a nice handmade Shu Mei style pork and veggie with a ponzu based sauce... no food service pot stickers here..  real house made dumplings  Free egg rolls were nice and light with same dipping sauce as crab rangoon.  Cashew chicken was amazing... the egg plant slices were awesome!  White rice that comes with each entree was wonderful... perfectly dry and sticky.  Only warning... items on menu may be fried even if not listed as fried on menu.  Only 3 entrees list fried chicken... unfortunately that is not the case.  Ordered the sweet and sour chicken thi nm ing it would be something besides thick greasy sticks of dry tasteless white meat... I was partially right... sadly it was every negative stereotype plus they were covered in the sauce and veggies and pineapple.  By the time our takeout made it 10 miles home the breading had soaked up all the sauce and was a solid nasty mass of goo!  I picked out the chicken and found it rock hard and too dry to even shred. I salvaged the pineapple and green pepper too... saved it all in the fridge and will try and revive it tomorrow as a round two dinner.  Even with that $11 lesson we really loved,the rest and will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Simply massive amounts of food that's incredibly good. I've never had a problem finishing off an entree but I simply can't do it at this place. The prices are very reasonable as well. All around great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Boy I sure hope this place makes it as it was fabulous. We started out with their version of egg rolls and they were not your usual but that made them delightful. We also did the tzatziki spread with warm pitas. It was loaded with cucumber and went fast! Them we moved onto entrees consisting of Chicken lo Mein, chicken fried rice and gyro platter. The Lo mein was loaded with chicken and veggies with a refreshingly light flavorful sauce.  The fried rice was magnificent too again lots of chicken and fresh veggies.  The gyro was so great meat tender (and real!) I loved the twist they took using a garlic sauce.  Fresh cut fries were stunning. The portions were all large and so fresh tasting. We can't wait to go back and try other items. Please try them it is a great place!"}
{"text":"This place is brand new and my family and I went there for dinner today. We went because my son works there, but we were impressed with the food. Being brand new they have to hit their stride, but everyone really liked their dinner. I had the Philly Cheese steak, my daughter had the sweet and sour chicken, and my wife had the orange chicken and it was all very tasty."}
{"text":"I love yelp to help find amazing new places. I was very happy that the food outdid the ambience.  Not much elegance as long as the food is amazing. We ordered the TumYum soup to start. It came out very hot and the aroma was amazing. The vegetables and the broth is a total 10. The shrimp cooked in the soup to perfection. We ordered the mei fun and Bangkok hot plate. Both had great flavor and more then two meals. The chicken was slightly overdone. The hot plate was very good and amazing flavor.  Was unique and the veggies where perfect. The side condiments where hot oil, pepper, and sugar. The reason I write that is primarily why I give it a four star. They need to clean the plastic containers or find something else to display the side condiments.  I will be back and look forward to a different dish possibly the curry selection."}
{"text":"Very helpful and courteous staff ! Take out took a bit long but was delicious ! I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I am an avid Asian food fan, so when I say this is the best...it IS the best. Super big portions. Fresh ingredients. And a large menu that they will tweak to fit your taste buds.   Then there is their great service. When you walk through the doors, you become a member of their family. They don't wait on you, THEY TAKE CARE OF YOU. They aren't happy, unless you are happy. Whether it is take out, or eat in, they go the extra mile to please.   This is my new Asian Food home! Treat yourself to a wonderful meal with friends."}
{"text":"Omg nothing else local even compares, we had the Cambodian numya soup, pho, pad Thai, and Cambodian tacos. Everything was fresh and super flavorful. One of the best meals I have had anywhere."}
{"text":"Occasionally you come across a restaurant with amazing ethnic cuisine which, upon tasting, leads you to question everything you know about food.  You become inspired to travel and experience the local fare, expanding your palate with novel flavors and dishes you didn't know existed.  After eating at Asian Greek Cuisine, I find myself questioning not only everything I know about what passes for food in general, but also my desire to venture beyond so-called chain restaurants ever again.  We came to this restaurant as part of a group, and were the only patrons at 6:00 on a Saturday evening (red flag). The staff was friendly, and we were seated in the empty restaurant immediately.  We ordered appetizers from the Greek menu (hummus and spinakopita), which were bland and uninspired.  The pita bread served with the hummus was OK, but was no different than that which could be obtained at a local Acme.  Finding the appetizers underwhelming, we decided to order off the Asian menu.  Unfortunately, at this restaurant, culinarily crossing the globe resulted in equally disappointing results.   Dinner consisted of beef fried rice and pad thai.  While the portions were large, so too was the disappointment.  The fried rice was under-seasoned and tasted as though it was from the last of an old bag of Uncle Ben's.  The eggs used were rubbery and failed to mask the distinct taste of the vegetables which were reminiscent of those one encounters in college when consuming $0.25 ramen noodles.  The Pad Thai also lacked seasoning, and the noodles were sticky and undercooked.  I was only able to eat a quarter of the dish, before deciding to abandon the endeavor for leftovers I had in the fridge at home.  In all, I would rather spend my money on the exotic food at Chipotle than try this restaurant again."}
{"text":"This place is a must to try. The food were very good   The Pad Thai noodle is the best I have tasted.  The Summer roll were also good.  The bubble tea was good too.  The service was excellent.  The place is clean.  Very good overall.  I would come back."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow!! Went her the other night based on other reviews and this place rocks!  Not the fanciest place, but immaculately clean, spacious , and everyone is friendly, made me feel very welcomed.  On to the food..... had fried dumplings that came with a sauce that was superb. I asked what they recommend for entree and took their advice went with seafood hot pot. All cooked perfect, plenty of seafood and FRESH vegetables which were nice and crisp. Broth was tasty and the rice cooked to perfection. One of the freshest simple tastiest meals I've had in a long time.  They do a brisk take out business as well. I will be back every time I visit Akron area."}
{"text":"The owners were extremely nice and we're smiling the whole time, which is always awesome. I got the Chicken Kopastini pita wrap and it was great. So were the fresh cut fries. The portion was huge. Very good seasoning used on the chicken.  The chicken fried rice was about average."}
{"text":"We stopped in this little restaurant last week after reading some of the reviews.  Oh my!  The restaurant is very clean, and the service was exceptional.  They have a very diverse menu, it was hard to choose. They don't serve alcohol, but didn't really miss it, just went home and had a glass of wine afterwards. Their curry dishes are very good, and I actually got dinner and 2 lunches out of my order.  I am gluten free, and they  have many rice noodle dishes. We also have since gotten takeout, and everything was perfect.  Great service, great food, and definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I've been so excited about the opening of this restaurant and I was not disappointed. The gyro meat is REAL meat, not processed strips of meat. It was juicy and flavorful and the giant fresh cut fries were perfect! They will be seeing me frequently!"}
{"text":"First time here. Very nice staff and friendly people. For an appetizer, I chose the summer rolls. Bigger than any restaurant I've been to that serve summer rolls. For lunch I had the beef pho. It was a huge portion and very flavorful. Boyfriend got the calamari....OH MY!! Soooo good!!!! Reasonable prices. Would definitely go back and try other dishes on the menu!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. We sampled egg rolls from the Asian menu and gyros from the Greek section. The egg rolls, while a bit different from the usual Chinese restaurant egg rolls, were fresh and obviously made from scratch. They were served very hot and were quite delicious; served in a portion of three egg rolls for $4.25.   The gyros were large and tasted great. The garlic sauce that they were served with was good, however I think I would have preferred the traditional tzatziki sauce. The thick cut fries were worth the visit.   Service was very prompt and the chef came out to chat, which was a nice touch.  Always happy to support local restaurants and wonderful to have an alternative to the corporate chains that dominate the area. I look forward to returning for a Greek dinner and an Asian dinner from the menu."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I make it a point to try as many restaurants as possible in our area. We have developed a liking for asian food, especially Thai, and have eaten at most of the good Thai places locally including pad Thai, Thai gourmet, lemon grass and cilantro. Admittedly, this place started at the bottom of the list due to its name. In my experience fusion restaurants tend to be \"jack of all trades\" and rarely stand out.  That being said, we finally got around to trying this place and I wish we had done it sooner. The restaurant was nearly empty early on a Friday evening. We were greeted promptly by a very friendly woman who I assume is one of the owners. She gave us a rundown of the menu and told us that they just hired a new chef within the last 2 weeks and were in the process of expanding the building and revamping their Thai menu. We wanted a good sampling of the menu and ordered spring rolls, yellow curry, cashew dish, and coconut fried rice at her recommendation.   The food came out promptly and was absolutely the best Thai food that I have ever had and it wasn't very close. The sauces were rich and flavorful. The portions were very large and they didn't skimp on the meat. The service was very personal and even the chef came out to say hello to us. I would absolutely recommend this restaurant to anyone whether they love Thai food or not! It is a diamond in the rough that I hope stays in this location for a really long time. We will be back again just as soon as I stop being full from our last meal there."}
{"text":"Great food and phenomenal service.  We will definitely add this restaurant to our list of local favorites!"}
{"text":"Wow! Authentic style, beautiful presentation in a family atmosphere. They don't have a liquor license but don't mind if you BYOB (no cork fee, either). If you're in the mood for Thai or Chinese, this is as good as I've had in NEO."}
{"text":"First time visit and was pleasantly surprised.  Owners were very kind and welcoming.  There was a lot to choose from on the menu including a few American favorites. Food was good and the portions were enormous.  Prices were fair. We will be returning."}
{"text":"I recently got turned onto this place and I am so thankful I did. The location was hard for me to find even though I am from the area, but it was worth the trouble. I ordered four of the gyro specials! DELICIOUS!!! One of thebest gyros I've ever ate. The service was friendly and helpful and the chef came out to chat as well. The truth is this is one of those spots that you want around you. I love Greek food and truthfully for the price I can't feed my children fast food! I'd much rather eat here any day of the week. The quality of food was very good and I would suggest you give these guys a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very good Pho. The restaurant is smaller, but clean and pleasant. The owner was very nice, and our takeout was ready quickly."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant!  Wonderful service and fresh ingredients!  I go back at least once a week and always get the Tom Kha soup - either as an entrée or as take out.  I've never had anything I didn't like. I've tried the Asian nachos, the grilled chicken skewers with peanut sauce, Pad Thai and so much more. My daughter, who is vegan, was very pleased with the assortment of food and how much she enjoyed the dishes - curry, eggplant, spring rolls, veggie egg rolls, tom kha soup, etc.  I hope they will be around for a long time!"}
{"text":"Going here yesterday was such a nice experience. We read about it on yelp and stopped in for lunch. The man inside was smiling and greeted us. Such a sweet man! Im assuming it was the owner basically. A very clean, friendly, helpful. Calm, smiling man. We loved him!   We wanted some pho - he suggested the beef pho. It was enormous and delicious. And we each got our own plate of other stuff like bean sprouts. He explained that if we wanted we could add chilli oil or chilli paste or some hoisin sauce. Those things are on the table. It was just darn tasty as it was tho.   They also had a special where if you got pad thai or another lunch then you got a free little soup. We tried the tom yum soup - it was delicious! It had little mushrooms and chicken and basil? Maybe with sort of a sour/spicy/flavorful broth - delicious! The pad thai we got filled the whole styrofoam container - it was an immense amount. (Later when i tried the pad thai it was slightly dry - but could have been better fresh)   The man was so sweet. I can't even tell you - he just was so cute. He seemed super excited about the food and to tell us a little about it - tho he was jot overbearing in any way - just perfect. Im not sure if he is from cambodia or some other place? I heard him saying some foods were cambodian. Then he suggested if we liked the pad thai to also try the \"pad ke mow\" or something that sounded like that. It has a thicker noodle and he said it was very good.   Please give it a try. The man was clean, the restaurant was clean, the bathrooms were clean and he seems to take a lot of pride in the place. The food was very fresh (like fresh basil, bean sprouts) - everything looking so nice. High quality foods. Ask him about the foods if he and you have a moment and see how he talks about the food with such pride and love.  Oh I have never asked anything of you but please visit this restaurant."}
