{"text":"We were staying at the Renaissance pittsburgh and decided to walk to Starbucks, which is about a minute walk.  Then we discovered this gem while walking to the Square. Inside is a French patisserie with macarons, a cafe, a small grocery, and a wine bar. At around 9am on Saturdays and Sundays this shop has cooked scrambled eggs, cooked bacon, sausage,  potatoes and omelette  made to order!   everything was delish! Much more fun than a regular breakfast bagel from a chain restaurant or a hotel breakfast buffet!!! Such a charming place in downtown Pittsburgh!!!"}
{"text":"My review is only for the wine bar. It is tiny (and for us, it was a little hard to find) but we loved it. Our bartender that night was a lovely young woman (originally from somewhere down south) who was friendly and informative. It is a very casual place with great wine. We tried a flight and a number of others and her recommendations were spot on (of course, we brought home a bottle as well :)). It was a perfect spot to slip into after walking around downtown Pittsburgh. I wish the rest of the place had been open when we arrived, but we'll be sure to check it out next time we're in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I've visited the grocery store a few times and I was pleased with the quality of the products. My favorites are their crab cakes and coffee.   I've been wanting to visit their wine bar for a while and finally got the chance to do so. Again great quality products, but the experience was very poor. I was really disappointed. I'm sitting at the bar and there is another person eating, drinking, having a good time. Next thing I know...he is behind the bar working!! :D He continued drinking and it became apparent that he was drunk. The other employees were friendly but not very educated on what was available. The wines here are Italian...yet every time they compared them to French wines. They would benefit from training.   Additionally, they were not clear with my friends about the wine tasting samples when they said they had never visited before. \"I can give you samples of whatever you want!\" Oh, but she failed to mention it's a $2 charge per sample which they didn't even let my friend finish! The constant staring from them was also a nice touch.   While the grocery store is nice, I would not recommend the wine bar."}
{"text":"Food is tasty but the service is less than desirable for the outside grill. Guys running the grill are rude, mouthy in an impudent way and the wait has been 30 minutes on both occasions."}
{"text":"Went with a friend for brunch. We arrived just as the Wine Room was opening. Based on the on-line menu, I was looking forward to trying the Chicken and Waffles. Although I was the fourth person overall to order this morning, they were out of Chicken and Waffles*...so, I ordered my second choice, Eggs Benny. The menu described it as a biscuit topped with corned beef, an egg, Guinness and cheddar cheese sauce with some shaved potatoes on top.   What I got was not what I expected. It was served barely warm and the sauce had already begun to skin over, there was no corned beef...instead it was roast beef...and the amount of shaved potatoes would not have equalled a thin slice of a teeny, tiny baby potato. The Guinness and cheddar sauce was brown, cold and bitter. When the meal was delivered, we were asked if we wanted salt and pepper to which my friend and I just gave a blank stare as neither of us had even tried a bite. It wouldn't have mattered if we did as they didn't know where the shakers were.  The only reason I gave it two stars is because of the ambience of the Wine Room. I doubt, however, that I will ever be back as there are so many other, much better, places to have brunch.  * I just want to make this perfectly clear, I was the first person today to order the first thing on their menu and THEY WERE OUT!! Obviously, they don't prepare for each day separately."}
{"text":"Just moved downtown and stopped in this evening for a quick glass.   They were very helpful so I ended up get flights to taste their selection from Abruzzo.    They chose a great variety for me.  Enjoyed the wine and the atmosphere. I would recommend to anyone who likes to explore different wines."}
{"text":"They offer weekend brunch now in the wine bar in the back of the store. It was outstanding!   Every table gets a starter plate with a biscuit, muffin, and a huge plate of fruit with Greek yogurt. Then you choose your main course. I got the Brussel sprout hash and my mother got the smoked salmon.  Delicious!   The service is prompt and everyone is exceptionally welcoming and kind.  Brunch at Market Street Grocery is more than welcome in the burgh, where good weekend brunch spots are severely lacking. Do yourself a favor and give them a visit. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great wine bar, wonderful staff a go to place! This is a great addition to the downtown food scene! Jonny is a great asset!"}
{"text":"What a great addition to Downtown and it was exactly what Downtown was missing! It's a cute little store that has most of your grocery staples and then it's a little bit of everything else. What do I mean by that? So it's also a coffee shop, a bakery, a wine bar, and a restaurant. That's a lot of variety for such a small store, but that's perfect for downtown residents who need something in a pinch when all the other places in town are closed after 5pm.   I've yet to make my way to the wine section of the store but I've tried nearly all the other aspects of Market Street Grocery. In all honesty, I wouldn't buy any of the grocery items (including produce) here because they have such a high mark-up for the convenience factor. Their full coffee bar serves up some good coffee, which they serve La Colombe coffee btw. However, I'm not sure how the coffee is competing with Starbucks and Nicholas Coffee, both right around the corner. The French macaroons are from Gaby Et Jules and they are fantastic. At $2.50 a pop, they're so worth it! There are many flavors to choose from, including a special flavor each month. My favorites are the White Chocolate Basil and Raspberry. Another thing I love about Market Street Grocery is the selection of prepared foods, consisting of a selection of hot items and a selection of cold items. From what I could tell, these selections change daily. I've ordered quite a few prepared food items and they've never disappointed. Not even the blackened tuna, which looked like it would be gross since it was stored in the cooler. The tuna was perfectly seasoned and seared on the outside, while still raw on the inside; it was a perfect medium rare.   Overall, Market Street Grocery is a nice stop to for (almost) everything you need; freshly brewed coffee, baked goods, prepared foods, wine and groceries. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Excellent! Breakfast casserole was amazing.  The macarons were melt in your mouth perfection.  Wonderful, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I'm stoked for ya, downtown! Market St Grocery has come along and got ya covered with a sweet selection of organic and high end foodstuffs!  This is a really cool little specialty market. I pass through town a lot, and it's nice to have a place to grab some organic veggies or Bob's Red Mill flours. Plus, as a lover of good cheese, I appreciate a quick stop that carries Drunken Goat and Humboldt Fog!  Check out Pittsburgh Ice Cream Company and their array of fun flavors, like Salty Goat Caramel, and Landlocked Vanilla (which uses Wigle Whiskey's Landlocked Rum!).  Next up for me: Trying their Cafe and Diner!"}
{"text":"I just--ugh--I am *such* a sucker for Market Street Grocery.  I just find it laughable that before it opened, city news outlets made such a big deal about a grocery store opening up in downtown Pittsburgh.  I'm sorry, but this is not a viable alternative to Giant Eagle or your local family grocery at all.  It's more like a specialty foods shop.  The products are absurdly hip and they aren't cheap, but they stock that Whole Foods-quality good stuff that I love to ogle so much.  I stop in here for the hot breakfasts, the coffee, and occasionally, I will treat myself at the Gaby et Jules pasty counter.  Just note that Gaby et Jules is like a pop-up stall, which means that you pay them separately from everything else in the store.  Anyway, the employees at Market Street Grocery are VERY friendly, and the breakfast foods are delicious.  They use that good, thick bacon, y'all! I follow their Instagram account and drool over the daily lunch offerings, but for some reason have yet to actually try it yet.  I will crack soon, I'm sure."}
{"text":"This review is for the coffee bar, the only thing I tried.  They have La Colombe (yay!) which is great.  The line moved slowly, the coffee was great.   I was there mid-morning and I'd be a little hesitant to try to hit this during the lunch hour."}
{"text":"Fresh food, premium products, courteous service. Best suited for lunch, coffee, and picking up specialty items. Notwithstanding occasional hit-or-miss product availability issues, an overall winner that fills a big gap in downtown grocery shopping."}
{"text":"This is really a gem in the downtown area. Market Street Grocery is a wonderful addition for downtown residents and workers alike. It's a charming little space with lots packed in it. There's Jules & Gaby for delicious macarons, prepared hot and cold foods, and if you're searching for caffeine, let one of the baristas make you a latte or cappuccino.   I come here somewhat regularly for lunch. There's always a great selection of hot foods including soups to choose from. And the prices are very reasonable, definitely cheaper than going to Blue Bird Kitchen.  My favorite spot is the wine bar. It's a great casual space to hang out alone or with others. The staff is nice and very knowledgeable. They have happy hour from 5-7pm everyday. I've tried a couple of the little bites and they're pretty good. I love the fromage d'affinois and tallegio cheeses."}
{"text":"Great lunches! They have daily lunch specials both hot and deli style. Their general tsos chicken might be better than a Chinese restaurant! No kidding. Try it next time you're in. They also update their daily lunch options on their Instagram every morning. I also can never pass up getting a fresh macaron from the Gaby et Jules counter."}
{"text":"This place is long overdue.  Working downtown and living nearby, we have long complained about our lack of options between here and home.  By the time we leave, most Strip grocers are closed, and that other market that is open in the Strip just doesn't seem fairly priced or offer much in terms of a selection.  Lots of unique cheeses, fresh produce, meats and seafood here.  A great coffee bar, Gaby et Jules bakery, and more.  I'm looking forward to becoming a regular here!  If you live near or in downtown and work here, I am sure you will enjoy this spot too!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place! This essentially is the only store of its kind downtown. They sell grocery essentials of course. In addition, they have wonderful coffee and baked goods. There also happens to be a wine bar in the back of the store!"}
{"text":"I work downtown and having this market is extremely convenient! Yes, it's a little pricey and they don't have everything you could ever need, but they have the basics and it's the only market of its kind downtown! Need to grab a six pack? Coffee? Wine? Have nothing for dinner and want to grab fresh meat and veggies? They've got you covered. They also have prepared foods if you're looking for something you don't have to cook or need a quick lunch. I have thrown together many meals with the help of this place and I love the convenience of not having to go food shopping after work!"}
{"text":"Super cute little store, they have salads and hot food as well & it all looked super good. I got a salad that had fruit and what I thought was feta but I think was actually goat cheese, still really yummy! There's a coffee bar, and a macaroon counter. I got a vanilla iced latte and it was delicious! I meant to try out the macaroons but I didn't get the chance to, cute sitting area outside and a little picnic table inside. It's super downtown so parking would be hard, luckily I could walk from my hotel. Will definitely be coming back next time I'm in the burg!"}
{"text":"Convenient and hidden gem in Market Square behind and integral to Market Grocery. Small boutique wine store with amazing selection of each varietal. Glass and bottle prices.   A must do on a date night, before the theater or happy hour."}
{"text":"Came here a couple of weeks ago when I was visiting Pittsburgh for the first time. And when I first walked in, I was immediately drawn to the bakery. So many unique macaron and locally made jam options! They were great gifts to take back home for the family. The customer rep who assisted was so accommodating, when we asked if they had any discounts he mentioned the student discount. So if you're a student, ask! You might get 10-20% off! On top of that, when we asked if there were any ice cream/froyo places around, he recommended us towards the back(near the wines). And let me tell you, you can't leave without trying their ice cream! We tried two samples, but the one that gave me a foodgasm was the lavendar lemon donut ice cream. Every component within the name, you tasted, you smelled, and you felt. Literally died and went to heaven!"}
{"text":"THIS IS A MUST If you love wine and find yourself in Pittsburgh! My girlfriend and I are visiting Pittsburgh for the first time and randomly discovered this incredible spot. There are no words to describe the amazing customer service we received. We are first time visitors to Pittsburgh and the owners made us feel so welcomed. They took the time to tell us everything this great city has to offer as well as pour us a few glasses of some amazing wine. When we came to Pittsburg we didn't know what to expect and didn't want to do the typical touristy spots. Getting lost in this city was one of the best experiences. You truly meet some amazing people. Do yourself a favor and stop in and get yourself a glass of wine or a sandwich or some ice cream! You won't be disappointed!   PS: Try the rosé ice cream! It's one of a kind!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I usually disregard Yelp reviews that are based on complaints about the service, because I feel that with the server/customer interaction you usually get out what you put in. That's not quite the case here - our server was polite and friendly. But still the service put a major damper on what could have been a rock solid experience.  I came with my family for Mother's Day brunch at the wine bar in the back. Cute little space, maybe just 3 or 4 tables and 4 more seats at the bar. Menu was interesting, and Prix Fix option was a decent value for a nice brunch. We ordered, talked over some coffee, and talked, and talked...  The food took over an hour to come out. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to rush Mother's Day brunch but that's not right. My parents had to drive a few states over after brunch so we weren't looking to stretch things out indefinitely. The other tables were clearly perturbed, and being a quiet space we could hear the conversations at each. Likewise, the wait staff was concerned, whispering to themselves about the problems in the kitchen, but never acknowledged the issue to us. I found that kind of patronizing - we're sitting in a small room with nothing to do for more than an hour, of course we are going to see and hear what is going on.  The food was solid - Eggs Benny better than Chicken and Waffles better than Hash. I'd give the food four stars. But to have an understaffed or incapable kitchen staff on one of the biggest brunch days of the year really dampened my enthusiasm. I'm in no hurry to come back - unless I have a couple of hours to kill."}
{"text":"Lovely little market in the center of market square. I got a coffee and a chocolate croissant, both were delicious and fresh. They offered made to order omelets at a cart outside. Defiantly worth a stop in, if you are passing through the area and went quality coffee."}
{"text":"I'll go to Market Grocery over Starbucks any day"}
{"text":"Wandered into the Market Street Grocery for the first time this morning and was really pleasantly surprised. I didnt spend as much time as i wouldve liked because i was on my 30 min lunch break, but i was pretty impressed with the selection and the prices, and the staff working this morning was super friendly, which was great. I had my name tag on, and one guy working noticed and addressed me by name while i was browsing, which really impressed me and made me feel welcome. I cant wait to go back when i have more time!"}
{"text":"Walking up to Market Street Grocery can briefly transport you another place. The grand structure with big windows sits on a small side street off of bustling Market Square. In the summer, bright blue tables and chairs line the sidewalk. This afternoon the scene struck me as very French!  That vibe continues on the inside with a La Colombe coffee bar and Gaby et Jules macaron counter. You can build a great lunch from the cold food case, which is priced by weight. I don't purchase many of their specialty grocery items, but it's nice to swing by Market Street Grocery on my lunch break if I ever need to pick up an ingredient for dinner. I've always had quick and friendly service from the staff as well."}
{"text":"Market Street Grocery has been a much-needed addition to downtown. For those of us that live in the city and work downtown, it's ideal for grabbing groceries daily, as opposed to massive weekly trips to the larger grocery stores.  If there's one issue, it's the lack of inventory consistency throughout the day. The shop isn't very large, so I understand needing to rotate based on shopper behavior throughout the day, BUT not having meat or fish at the end of the workday when we're stopping in to grab something to take home for dinner is frustrating. They're still working on figuring out what/when to stock various items, but this has been the only real issue we've experienced thus far.  Overall, though, the inventory is excellent for a small grocer. They've managed to stock some random, hard-to-find things (ex. Spanish Sherry Vinegar), and also have whole bean coffee/espresso options from La Colombe, which is great to see! The produce, cheese selection, and warm foods options are great, considering the limited space, as well. Having Gaby et Jules within the store is also perfect for grabbing a daily baguette (or croissant...or macaron), and the café portion of the store makes some good, simple drinks.  The staff is awesome. Helpful and really a pleasure to deal with, and the prices are more than fair...especially when you factor in the convenience of being able to avoid the larger chaotic stores after work.  If Market Street Grocery can find a way to keep meats and seafood stocked in the late afternoon/early evening for those of us leaving work and trying to finalize our at-home dinner menu, they'll easily get 5 stars from me. Until then, 4 stars is probably right for a place that's got it ALMOST perfect...almost."}
{"text":"Best coffee I found in Pittsburgh by far. Nice people, good vibes. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. My wife and I were regulars for about SIX months. They do NOT know how to treat their staff. Go to Giant Eagle. Better prices, better quality. The \"fancy\" look is not worth it.  My wife once came in without me and told me a story that I refuse to believe. I will not share it because it is too disgusting but the take away is- the employers do not care about the employees, the store or the customers. This is just another way for them to make a quick dollar. I hope this place shuts down; SOON. Unfortunately I cannot give ZERO stars."}
{"text":"My coworker took me here as I said I was \"bored of downtown lunch\".   I was hooked upon entering. Super cheap lunch that fills you up and feels on the verge of healthy up at the deli counter. The french bakery corner? Yes. Elephant ear me now!   I haven't tried the wine bar yet but that is on my list. Some day!  I noticed that you started doing some on the street sandwich making during lunch. I haven't tried that but I also have no idea how it works. Maybe put some signage up?"}
{"text":"This is a tiny market but filled with lots of goodies. When you walk in there is a \"coffee shop\" on your right. On your left is a mini French bakery-the main item being macaroons. There is a small cold case that has a nice variety of beer. There is a deli case with prepared foods. Everything looked tasty. There is a small freezer with a few types of icecream. One was a local Pittsburgh ice cream. Way to represent!!  There is a dairy case and then a section where you could grab premade sandwiches and salads.  The prices are a bit high but the quality of their items make it worth it. If I lived downtown this is definitely where I would shop."}
{"text":"The best place for prepared food, groceries, wine and coffee in downtown! A perfect one stop shop for me and my friends. Whether it's their delicious lunch during work, a wine and cheese happy hour, or groceries to take home- Market Street Grocery never disappoints. Everyone there is awesome and I couldn't love it more!"}
{"text":"So unique....you can eat and drink wine same location but two different vibes!   When you enter you are greeted by the deli side. The atmosphere is bright and upbeat. Immaculately designed and fresh....various menu options to choose from. You will be greeted by friendly staff that welcome you upon entering. Centered right in the heart of Market Square but quiet enough to unwind after a rough day.   Now onto my favorite the wine bar! Cassidy immediately greets you and makes you feel at home. This ultra relaxing atmosphere (which is located in the back end of the store) offers a reclined atmosphere. Great for a group of friends to gather or quaint enough to relax and enjoy own your own. Generous pours and variety is what you can expect. I really enjoyed my visit!"}
{"text":"At the Bakery, I asked where I could get a good cuppa, that wasn't $bux or Dunkies. They pointed me across the street to the Market Street Grocery.  All in all I'm glad they did. The barista was wonderful, The coffee was delicious and the shop was just amazing. They have lots of neat little sub shops within. A Macaroon shop, a grocery, a wine shop and what have you. Honestly this is a neat gem of a place. A must visit if you're down town."}
{"text":"A beautiful little grocery store with several counters (e.g. coffee, bread, meat, breakfast foods from a hot bar, a selection of prepared foods and a bit of nice looking produce). I was stuck downtown for a conference all week, and wish I found this place sooner.  Had a tasty little omelet on Saturday morning when the other options nearby were  pretty sad. Also tried a sausage from their breakfast bar that apparently runs all week (omelet is weekends only I guess) which was one of the tastier mild sausages I've had."}
{"text":"OK, we wondered thru the Grocery, which looked nice and had some interesting items, to get to the Market Street Wine Shop and Wine Bar.  The Wine Bar probably should have its own listing on Yelp.  The wine bar carries Collefrisio wines from Italy. You can order a glass, a bottle, a flight, or take a bottle home with you.  Unfortunately not all wines or cheeses were available.  We selected two different reds to try and compare. Both were a dark ruby red with some fruity scent one had a more cherry jam flavor and the other more of a black cherry and mulberry flavor and were pretty well balanced.  We decided to try some cheese and meat options/charcuterie with our wine.  As mentioned previously, they were out of one of the cheeses and one of the meat options. We had a Jasper Hill cheddar cheese that was very good and a goat cheese that went well with the wines.  The soppressata was good but cut very thin, just a tad to thin.  It came with some slices of bread and mustard.  The waitstaff was very nice and helpful but the service was a bit disjointed.  It was a full house and a small place with only about 12 seats.    We did learn that you should go during Happy Hour because a couple of the wines are reduced to a more realistic price.  Again, following a local trend, the pricing was a bit high!  So go for Happy Hour!  There is separate entrance off of Graeme St. when the Market closes."}
{"text":"This grocery store, although small, is perfect for picking up something quick for lunch or even if I need to stop before going home from work. Their hot and ready food always tastes good. Not too long ago I discovered that they had a good breakfast food that I sometimes pickup on the weekends. Their food is always good."}
{"text":"good quality but very limited selection, an oasis of fresh organic veggies and fruits, not much there but better than nothing...very expensive but again you cant find this anywhere near here on foot! favorite find for me-dried papaya with No sugar and No sulfur-extremely rare and a treasured treat for me!!"}
{"text":"The second time I've run across a high-end micro-convenience grocery deli sort of place in a downtown during business travel in the last few months, so this is clearly a trend. The food here is a bit expensive, but not out of line given the location (the 7-11 a block away also has overpriced food that's a lot more disgusting). I would wish for a few more fresh ingredients but for what it is - processed options, fresh sandwiches, and the wine bar (which I did not get a chance to try) - is very cute and, um, cozy. (Small.) Feels like a nice getaway spot for a downtown stroll, or if you need some groceries for the mini-fridge. Very nice."}
{"text":"So cute! Prime location, prime workers, and prime products!   My boyfriend and I wandered in on a Saturday, and we were very impressed. The grocery has fresh produce, cheese, dairy, gelato bars, sandwiches, coffee, wine, prepared foods, and the list goes on.   They also have a gabe et jules counter with croissants and macaroons.   I will definitely be back to indulge."}
{"text":"I work in downtown and this place is my go to for a healthy lunch. If you get there early you can grab a salad or sandwich they make fresh daily. They carry local cheese and produce which I love. Their deli meats are local as well as smoked in house.  I get the sliced turkey which is only $10.99 a pound. The hot dishes they serve always change and are always a solid choice. They do weigh per pound and some items are a little pricey but so would eatting at any restraunt in Market Square. The price balances out with their service and quality of their products. There is seating inside and outside. Do not go their expecting to bargain shop but their prices on groceries are equal to the market. Shop local, eat local."}
{"text":"Great stuff, however it's SEVERELY marked up. Like $4 for an otherwise 78¢ can of soup marked up. It's disappointing to see a grocery store open up downtown, especially around so many universities, and try to pull prices like that. There is an end in the very near future for this store"}
{"text":"This is what I'd call a hybrid review because I'm reviewing the grocery as a whole and at the same time reviewing Gaby St Jules one of their vendors.  I had a lunch date so I had to return here to get a look at the whole place. They have a deli area where I got to sample a piece of pastrami. I learned that this is part of the grocery and they cure their own meats here.They  also have a hot prepared foods area where you can buy your lunch and take it with you. In the back their is a wine bar which is definitely on my return to do list. It stocks a vast array of wines and looks cozy and inviting. They are plenty of dry goods for shopping as well.  Gaby St Jules is in the entrance immediately on your left. It is a stand alone pop up store of the main one located in Squirrel Hill. They have a very limited selection here of their main shop but I was told that if I call that store with something I want in particular then they would have it sent to me.  Here they had an assortment of macaroons, French bread loaves, and 3 large pastries. One is an almond croissant, another was a French bread and the third was a regular croissant. These averaged about $3.00 for a nice size dessert. The macaroons sell for $2.20 each and I was told to refrigerate as soon as possible to avoid them getting hard. I purchased their almond macaroon along with a few sugarplum ones. I wasn't too crazy about the almond macaroon but did enjoy the sugarplum.  They had a small dessert called canele which was reasonably priced. The crust was caramelized while the inside consisted of rum and vanilla for flavoring. I bought it since it was small but wasn't over-thrilled with it.  If I were rating Gaby alone I would only give it 3 stars because I have tasted better macaroons and pastry elsewhere. However, the market as a whole is well laid out and makes a great opportunity for a grab and go or just if you need something to take home with you. It is located on Market Square next to a camera shop as you head towards Fifth Ave.  I definitely plan to return here to check out the wine bar and its offerings."}
{"text":"The only grocery store you'll find downtown. Although, it's hardly a quarter the size of your typical grocery store. Products are very limited and waaay overpriced for me. I'd rather make the extra trip to a Giant Eagle or Aldi.  Aside from the groceries, they have prepared meals and made-to-order sandwiches. The Tahini Dream is their only vegetarian sandwich but I definitely recommend it. They use \"roasted\" eggplant (actually just sliced up eggplant thrown in a panini press), hummus, miso vinaigrette, and any other veggies/cheese you want to add. Simple but delicious. They can toast it up for if you as well. I'll admit, they make some good sandwiches but $10 is a little steep for me.   There's also a little coffee stand, but like everything else, it's pricier in comparison to the coffee shops around market square."}
{"text":"I could have sworn I left a review last December after one of my first visits. I've been here a handful of times. It's a little pricey but not horrible and comparable to Whole Foods and the likes. A small market boasting lots of goodies from Gaby et Jules pop-up bakery to specialty peppers, breads, cheeses and meats. On my last trip I ordered peppers and they didn't have enough of the amount I wanted. I took what they had and a store member (I assume deli manager) advised cashier not to charge me for them. Excellent customer service."}
{"text":"I love this little market! When I lived downtown, it was nice to have a grocery store nearby to grab food throughout the week if I couldn't get to the supermarket. Their prices can be a little high for fresh fruit and hot food though.   I wish this market offered more vegetarian options. Though I was surprised to see that they offer Beyond Burgers in their freezer! That's amazing! But I'm looking for more options in their hot food bar as well as their refrigerated to go food. They have a good selection of fruits/vegetables, pasta, sauce, soups, condiments and drinks. They even have Gaby et Jules macarons!"}
{"text":"Awesome little shop. First time visiting and I bought some coffee. I will be back in the morning for their breakfast. They make lunch sandwiches also. They have chicken and beef raw. They also have cooked food in a case if you want to grab a quick lunch. The staff was very helpful and even offered to grind my coffee beans for me. (A service I didn't know they did)."}
{"text":"I walked in with no expectations and walked out knowing that a considerable portion of my weekly lunch expenditure will go straight to paying these wonderful proprietors and their employees.  Where to begin?   1.  They have a dedicated counter for Gaby et Jules patisseries.  Fresh macarons and pastries within reach!    2.  A great selection of fresh food: fruit, meats, sides, seafood, etc.  It all looked really good, really fresh, and reasonably priced considering the location. Surprisingly reasonable, actually.  3. Higher-end options, including hard to find organics and locally-sourced milk, yogurt, butter, etc.  It's nice to know that I can venture out on my lunch break and pick up something healthy.  It's also nice to know I can stop here before I leave for the day if I need an entire meal or just a single ingredient.  They sell some craft beer six packs and wine too.  Again, considering location, prices were very reasonable.    I can't wait to actually try some of the food here, but for now I'll walk away with a bag o' macarons and a smile."}
