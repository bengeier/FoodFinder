{"text":"I was almost put off by the reviews of things being too salty. I'm so glad I didn't listen. Sure the Peameal bacon and tots were a bit salty but I was eating bacon so that makes a whole lot of sense. Bacon is salty, that shouldn't be a surprising fact.   Sadly they were all out of hollandaise so breakfast poutine was off the table. I went with the peameal bacon on a bun. First off the bun was fresh and delicious and the slices of bacon were seriously thick. It was excellent value for the massive amount of food. Also there is a complimentary bowl of fruit (apples and oranges) to sort of attempt to balance the scales. My partner was also very pleased with his breakfast burrito.   I'm glad that he is often in our area on weekends and can't wait to come back. My only regret is not trying this sooner!"}
{"text":"The truck was parked on King and Strachan on a Saturday morning and we happened to be driving by on our way to tims to grab a quick bite. So we stopped here instead and ordered the eggmanwich $6 and the breakfast poutine (small) $7. Both were very good. Dave enjoyed the sandwich as it had bacon, eggs and sausage. It was tastey. I enjoyed the poutine as it was made with tater tots, bacon, chopped sausages and cheese, topped with Hollandaise sauce and garnished  with chives.  It was an inexpensive and fast breakfast and it was conveniently located away. The only complaint is it was quite salty and I couldn't finish the poutine."}
{"text":"Love the poutine, best hollandaise sauce in Toronto. The BELT is served on an awesome egg-dough bun and was supper filling for the price,  the over easy egg on it made my day. Best hangover cure in Lib Village. Find this truck if you can."}
{"text":"We have seen The Egg Man truck parked in front of Massey Harris park on King West a couple of times and were curious. And this morning as we took our coffee in the park we decided to try it out. I had the B.E.L.T which came on a soft egg bun and was delicious. It was a perfect balance of egg cheese, bacon, tomato and lettuce.   And my partner had the grilled cheese with bacon, which was a whole lot of cheese and bacon - almost too much, but really satisfying.   It is also great that they set up shop down in an area that is a bit of a wasteland - as far as street life goes. Having a food truck by the park livens things up a bit and makes the park into more than just a place to bring your dog to drop a deuce (which it largely is)."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Toronto. Beautiful North American portions of creative breakfast foods. Having had the breakfast quesadilla, the manwhich and the breakfast poutine; this food truck has become one of my favorite ways to pamper myself on a Saturday morning.  The food is always fresh (made the second you order), the service is always great and the prices are better than fair.  Love yourself. Have a manwhich."}
{"text":"Got the Manwich this morning at Bay and Elm. Bacon, sausage, egg (he happily accommodated my request for medium vs over easy) and cheese on a toasted english muffin. The sandwich comes piping hot which I really appreciate. What a delicious way to start off my morning! Thanks Eggman :)   They're located in Liberty Village on the weekends from 9am to 1pm, he told me the intersection but I forget now.."}
{"text":"The Eggman is great. My family and i look forward to our hearty breakfast on the weekends. Ask the Eggman for a Shep special. It's not on the menu. But it will fill you up for the whole day."}
{"text":"Tater tots was never a big thing for me as a child. After snagging a couple of The Eggman's golden-brown, crunchy, pillowy potato-bites off a coworker, I was seriously looking forward to tracking down this truck again. I was so serious that I stalked their online site for the truck's next appearance.  I went for the full tater tots overdose with the breakfast poutine. A generous helping of tots is mixed with crispy bacon, sausage, thick peameal, melted cheese and topped with tangy Hollondaise sauce. The various meat products give each bite a different savory note, while the sauce cut through all the heaviness so you didn't get sick of all the grease. The light sprinkle of chives was a valiant effort to give you some hint of vegetables, but grab an apple from their fruit bowl if you are worried about balance. Definitely way more than enough for breakfast. In fact I had it for breakfast, then lunch and toasted it again for a late-afternoon snack.   Also, grab a side of tater tots for the office!  It is surprising how fast they will disappear!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I got the manwiches with tatters. Tatters are a poor substitute for regular potatoes and my sandwich was so salty I could only eat half. Guy working there was super nice though. Unfortunately we wont be back."}
