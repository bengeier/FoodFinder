{"text":"Overpriced ordinary at best. Went on a weekend night and hardly anyone was there. Now I know why. 

Waitress disappeared for over 10 minutes after she said she'd be right back to take our order. 

Bread did not taste fresh. 

I ordered a medium rare steak and it arrived medium well. Mashed red potatoes were tasteless. 

Never going back."}
{"text":"Poor service, Horrible food, Flat soda, Nothing Italian about this place. No interaction with the guests. Place seemed very uninviting.  The only thing it had going for it was a cute bartender."}
{"text":"The wait at Outback was 1 hour and we were crunched for time. We spotted this restaurant across the street and noticed the nearly empty lot. My wife said \"how bad could it be?\".
Sadly, we soon found out. 
First the positives: there was no wait; the restaurant seemed to be clean; the side of shrimp I ordered was fresh and properly cooked.
The rest of the food on our table seemed to come out of a can. The marinara sauce was too bland and too sweet. Salad was iceburg lettuce with bagged croutons served with a mix of cheese food and a poor substitute for Italian dressing.  Their baked spaghetti dish consists of boiled spaghetti smothered in sauce and cheese then hot flashed in an oven. The watery pool under the crusty cheese made for an unappetizing display.
They are nice folks but could be Montrose's next candidate for Kitchen Nightmares."}
{"text":"The location in Copley is closed. Saw the sign on the front door \"closed until further notice.\""}
{"text":"The bartenders are amazing. I found the food very good. Talking to the staff about the bad reviews they agree that it was bad. The menu has changed as has the quality. Well worth a try!! I spent a month here and ate here nearly every night. Steaks are amazing."}
{"text":"Ugh...we thought this place was closed, and now we know why!  Food was so-so (new menu, so we were optimistic)...service was HORRIBLE...sat outside...might as well have been across the street at another restaurant...had to go inside to get / pay check...clearly we inconvenienced the waiter, as the first thing he told us was he did not want to be outside..."}
{"text":"The poor reviews are well deserved, poor quality ingredients poorly executed - and more - bugs in the vinegar cruet!"}
{"text":"Bartender Ryan was good, fast, attentive. Wedding soup was beefy and good. Shrimp lunch greasy and worthless. We were there at lunch in Sat and it was empty."}
{"text":"I just ate here tonight.  I would not recommend it.  We ordered the meatloaf, salmon, and chicken parmesan  All the food came out barely warm.  I am allergic to dairy which I stated several times but my side of pasta still came out with cheese on it.  The salmon was supposed to have a sauce on it but thank goodness they forgot to put it on because it was basically honey (it was supposed to be a bourbon sauce).  The meatloaf portion was small.  This is a very expensive restaurant for the quality of meal you receive.  The cooking definitely needs to improve for it to stay open and I hope he owners look at these reviews!"}
{"text":"Three of us visited this morning for breakfast and were greeted and seated promptly. However after our order was taken we waited nearly 50 minutes to receive our food. We were told there was a large party that was just served, but neither the restaurant or parking lot indicated any such thing. The food was good, but not exceptional. For the most part our server was prompt and attentive to her job, but was nearly 15 minutes in completing our bill and payments. I would expect to spend this much time on a friday or saturday evening dinner, but not for a quick sunday breakfast, on what appeared to be a somewhat slow time. We were there over an hour and a half! I hope things improve as we hate to see this building go empty another time. Maybe this was just a fluke?"}
{"text":"Food was awful! My chicken Marsala
Tasted like it a cup of Marsala wine was added to crappy Alfredo sauce. Marsala
Is not a creamy sauce! Blech!"}
{"text":"Food is very hit and miss. Pricing on the menu varies wildly, with many simple dishes costing astronomical amounts. Live music here was good. Best thing this place does is pizza. This restaurant seems to be having an identity crisis though. They push pizza, wings, and country music. They are supposed to be Italian, but have very high priced continental on the menu. Is this fine dining, italian, or pizza and wings? Pick one thing and do it right."}
{"text":"Probably the worst food not just italian styled but that I have ever tasted! The meat tasted reused, server was nice but the food was terrible! The fiore's barely had anyone there and it was a weekend evening...I should have followed my instincts that is never a good sign.  I ordered a meatball sub and fries and both were awful. Never again!! Terrible...nice server but food was trash! Strongly discourage!!"}
{"text":"Received a coupon for this restaurant in the Valpak and decided to try it out because of the 1/2 off dinner entree. So I took my beautiful girlfriend on Saturday night. 

Boy do I wish I would've read the reviews before we went. Where do I start?

We were seated in the bar and handed our plastic menus. The prices are outrageous for the lack of quality. I ordered the strip steak and my girlfriend ordered the crab leg dinner. 

My girlfriend has a gluten allergy and she specifically asked for her salad to have no croutons on it. Of course the salad was brought out covered in croutons. She sent it back and instead of making a new one the waiter obviously just picked them off because she found a crouton on the salad. 

My salad had the \"house\" dressing which obviously tasted like it was straight out of a bottle of wishbone because it was awful. 

The bread brought out was stale and not warm. 

My steak was requested to be medium rare and it was cooked completely thru. 

The crab legs were decent but not the 1 pound advertised for 24.99. 

I am just overall not impressed and will not go back and definitely will not recommend it. This place needs a lot of work if they are going to last in an area that is over saturated with much better choices."}
{"text":"Food is okay, but nothing special.  Pasta tastes like it is boxed.  Sauce is sweet but otherwise lacks any identity.  Juke box seems out of place.  Led Zep, Skynyrd, etc seem more suited for a townie bar, than a restaurant wanting to be Italian.  Service is attentive, but S L O W.  Bar shouldn't be afraid to add some alcohol to their drinks."}
{"text":"This was very disappointing. Another low quality restaurant trolling unknowing travelers on I77. You would be better off at McDonalds."}
{"text":"I had high hopes since the decor was lovely and service was fantastic.  Food was presented gorgeously but was soooooo very bland.  My table mates had osso bucco, lasagna, seafood and the red pepper pasta.  Drinks, especially the Sangria was yummy.  I feel bad for the servers. They work hard but the food is sad."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that the service here was fantastic! My husband and I sat at the bar and the bartender was fun and friendly. I ordered a red wine and my husband asked for a sample of beer that he'd never heard of. She obliged and he ordered a glass. 
Since we were a little skeptical of the reviews on here, we started with the calamari appetizer. It was legitimately the worst calamari we've ever had. We actually make a point to try calamari at lots of different places. This particular dish was over spicy, over heated and somewhat soggy. Based on that dish, we opted not to order entrees.
We won't be back. Hopefully that bartender can find another job before the place goes under."}
