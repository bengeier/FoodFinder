{"text":"Good burgers they always have a special combo
For a decent price burger and drink and fries same price as fast food joints
Go for Sweet potato fries 
Service a bit slow at times"}

{"text":"Great place to get a burger at any time of the day. It's open 24 hours. Staff is very friendly. The place has a good atmosphere. Definitely recommend this place for downtown lovers."}
{"text":"Meh, nothing special for how expensive it is. The beef is decent and I would even consider going to MCDONALDS over HERO burgers. It's quite expensive so I'd rather go to a good burger joint for the same price!"}
{"text":"Ordered through Order It, I had onion rings and Wild Alaskan Salmon Fillet with multigrain flatbread, added on peameal bacon, fried egg, and portobello mushrooms.  I noted to have the sauce on the side and toasted flatbread to avoid sogginess when the food arrived.  However, the sandwich came soaked in the sauce and the flatbread was not toasted.  What a mess!  The sandwich was also missing tomato that I ordered.  The onion rings were too chunky for my taste.  Do not recommend delivery service."}
