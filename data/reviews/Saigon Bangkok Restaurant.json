{"text":"Very impressive in cleanliness, excellent foods and friendliness.
The price is reasonable. A MUST try. 
Will come back for sure...Thank you Saigon Bangkok."}
{"text":"Great place. Don't have to say much but to try it out, you won't be disappointed if you got a taste for good food"}
{"text":"This place is a gem at the corner plaza of st. clair and runnymede.  Be selective of what you order, the food here is either amazing or mediocre.  The items that reminds me of home? Try the Bun Bo Hue ( spicy beef noodle soup), its amazingingly delish, and also duck with bamboo noodle soup.  Broken rice dish with variety of different meat options is incredibly flavorful as well.  And I would top that off with an authentic vietnamese ice coffee, so good. If you lucky, ask them about fried rice with salted fish, its not on the menu but if they have the ingredients, its one of my favs.  They recently offer vietnamese sandwiches as well, I havent personally tried it yet but will definitely try it soon."}
{"text":"Great place for pho and banh mi. The vermicelli is decent but not my fave. Tried some Thai dishes here also and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Just tried this new vietnamese / thai restaurant on St. Clair west. We've lived here for almost 5 years, and have never set foot or car into the plaza that it's in, but what with the Wal-Mart and new Petro Canada on the corner, well ... maybe things are looking up in this area. *sigh*

We ordered for take out as the menu had come to us in the mail; the bill was low with the 10% grand opening discount. There was only one person in there eating, but to be fair, they just opened a week ago, are in a plaza, and it was pouring rain.

The staff was sweet. They couldn't accept debit or credit cards yet, but as I said, they just opened. They deliver for free in the area, so that's a plus (they're only a 500 m walk though, so probably not necessary when it's not pouring).

We ordered pho, mango chicken, spring rolls and deep friend tofu. The pho wasn't the best ever, but we'll still have it again. The deep fried tofu had a good texture (sometimes it can be gross), but not fried enough. The mango chicken had a ton of mango, and while good, not amazing. 

The only real disappointment were the chicken spring rolls. They came with a ton of fish sauce, that lacked pepper flakes, or whatever the usual shiz is that you get. They were dense and a bit odd.

All in all though, an ok option. I'll probably stick with my other faves for thai - though I will try out their fresh rolls next time - but for cheap pho at St. Clair and Runny that's not scummy with friendly staff? This is a pretty good place to go."}
{"text":"Vietnamese / Thai / Pho restaurants are a dime a dozen in Toronto, but I was pleasantly surprised by how good this one actually is! While this part of St. Clair West is a rapidly developing area, it is still severely lacking in dining options. Saigon Bangkok is easily my favourite restaurant in the neighbourhood, and not just for a lack of options!

The menu is diverse, the food is delicious, and the service is always fast and courteous. Family owned and operated, Saigon Bangkok sometimes feels like you are having dinner in someone's else's dining room- complete with Family Channel programming on TV, potted plants and a fish tank. Perhaps it's not everyone's cup of tea, but I find it has a cozy charm. 

Each time I go, I try to to order something different, which as a vegetarian, is a rare luxury! So far, I've ordered everything from the pad thai, to the pho, to a sizzling hot plate, and I have yet to be disappointed! My boyfriend swears by the beef vermicelli and I've recently gotten my room mate hooked on the stir fry! The food is always fresh and flavourful, with generous portions (especially for take out)! 

On more than one occasion, I've been served by ten year old Karen, who is probably the most dynamic kid I've ever met, and actually a pretty good waitress! When she found out that I loved the guava candies they hand out with your bill, she sold me a bulk bag of them for $1.50!

If you're still not won over, the price alone is a selling feature, with most entrees costing less than $10! I don't know about you, but I'm broke as heck most of the time, so it's nice to know that I can still eat out once in a while without breaking the bank.

Don't get trapped by the cheap prices though! Debit is only available for orders over $15!"}
{"text":"Ordered seafood green curry and their soft shelled crabs, both were disappointing. My curry did not have much seafood in it and the soft shelled crabs were so oily. It tasted like it was old and just reheated."}
{"text":"Food is wonderful but the young waitress is not. She has screwed up the order the last 4 times I have been there. Wrong dish, missed dish, and she always seems annoyed when it is pointed out to her. Pity, with better management this could be a wonderful restaurant. They need to use order pads to take written orders as most other restaurants do.
I will try it once more but if she gets it wrong again then I will look for a more reliable establishment"}
{"text":"I payed 8 bucks for an appetizer portion, and the owners daughter was eating what seemed to be my actual full sized soup..."}
{"text":"I really like the food here, great restaurant and it's always my go to pho place in the area! 

The pho soup is really good I normally get the special, but I've had the Basil Pad Thai (great generous portions), Green Curry Chicken and their shrimp spring rolls. All very very savoury and delicious. I sometimes also get their avocado shake, which is great! 

A nice homey family run business, good pho in the area!"}
{"text":"Standard Vietnamese food offerings (Pho, rice, vermicelli, etc.) in a restaurant that seats about 30 people; there are actually several choices in the plaza.  Family-owned, service is friendly but upon customer prompting.  We both had Pho and it hit the spot, can't complain."}
{"text":"I order delivery from this place using one of those apps all the time. Great flavour and portion! And it's awesome that delivery is free if you order more than $20!

My favourite is their shrimp rice paper rolls, grilled chicken Bahm Mi (only $5!), grilled chicken rice, crispy chicken rice and the signature broken rice. Some of their dishes come with the shrimp bean curd which is sooo good. In general I found their grilled chicken is better than grilled beef than pork chop. 

If you order delivery like I do, this place is nice to separate the soup when they deliver it to you, which is the proper way. However unfortunately the noodles will still be stiff when it's handed to you so I would not recommend pho for delivery."}
{"text":"I came here with my dad for a quick lunch, the place was empty when we arrived. I ordered the pho special which included beef, beef balls, tripe and I think beef tendon (there was only one small  one). I found the broth to be quite flavourful, but nothing to rave home about. But my favourite pho restaurant is still the one at Wilson!"}
{"text":"Ok after reading just the \"Star Ratings\" and dying for Pho that was close to home and can take out, we decided to try Bangkok. Let's just say I was not disappointed. To my surprise, when I got home, I could not understand why the bag was so big for 2 orders of Pho. I soon discovered why, the broth was contained separately from the noodles and (steak for me) (chicken for my Partner). Could not believe how fresh everything was. From the glass noodles, to the copious amounts of fresh beef and chicken to the bean sprouts and Thai basil and even the slices of line were extremely juicy. The price was excellent for 2 lg servings. I definitely have found another gen in the Big Smoke and it's just around the corner. I want to go on, but you know what, all I can say is, Go! Find out for yourself.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Let's start with the answer to a question they didn't want to answer: what are they best at...Thai or Vietnamese food? Answer: neither. The pho was the best dish because it had no flavor. The bun was awful and pad thai was barely edible. It looked like they put a bottle of siracha on it to add \"some spice\". Sadly, I have to rate this as they worst Vietnamese or Thai restaurant I've ever eaten at. Please don't waste your money or calories."}
{"text":"The pho was great and for 9$ the xl bowl was huge.  Enough for lunch the next day.  However....  There was a man who I assume was the owner,  sitting with his bare feet pointed at me up on a chair while he watched the football game....  Gross.  I had to call the waitress over to check on the appetizer that hadn't arrived when I was almost done my main.  I had to call her again to get a pitcher of water,  then again because she had forgotten to being me a glass. When I asked to take the rest to go she brought over a Styrofoam container and walked away. It felt like I was in their house and somehow intruding on them.  

My advice,  just call ahead and get it as takeout."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for dinner one night, there was only another table waiting for take out. Ordered the fresh shrimp rolls and a large pho. Very impressed by the flavour and meat portions! Shrimp rolls were delish, full of fresh herbs and decent size shrimps. 

I recommend this locally owned family Pho joint, although a bit pricier than most."}
{"text":"I've often been wondering if there's Pho outside of China Town, or Ossignton.  Now I know that there is.  Not only that, but it's tasty.  It's different than what i'd been expecting, and what I'd had up to now.

This whole place is a classic family restaurant where the daughter - who can't be older than 10 - takes your order.  Mom makes it happen, and then bam!  You got your tasty treats ready to go.

The Pho was delicious (7.50 small, 8.00 medium, 8.50 large) and it had a slight taste of Christmas.  

You'll know it when you try it."}
{"text":"We had the shrimp fresh spring rolls which were really good, and the lemongrass vermicelli with chicken and mango chicken were both decent, and huge servings for the price.

This place was very clean and had an authentic feel (picture menu!) that reminded us of our time in Vietnam. 

We went here because we saw a picture of bubble tea on the window! Unfortunately the bubble tea person was not in at that time to make it. 

We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Had the medium size pho with meatballs and slices of beef. It was a cold night so I loaded it up with spices and the hot pepper that comes inside the bowl. $9 and I was full. Family run place that aims to please."}
{"text":"On a cold day, a bowl of pho really hits the spot. The large size bowl of pho is enough to feed two!"}
{"text":"Love this place. We eat here often. Place is clean, food is fresh, pho is yummy and the price is excellent. Alot of authentic thai and vietnemese dishes. The owners are nice people. I dont think they speak fluent english but it never effects the service. My sister always orders a bubble tea. She says they are delicious."}
{"text":"The chicken wings here are super hot and super good!! I had the spicy beef noodle and it was delicious! I wish I could try my dishes but I was toooo full! I will definitely come back here!"}
