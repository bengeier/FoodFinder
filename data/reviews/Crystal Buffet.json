{"text":"No kidding this is possibly the worst restaurant I have ever eaten at. I didn't expect much from a Chinese buffet. I was initially shocked by the price $25 with tax on weekend evenings. The selection was enormous with many exotic items, however it is preferred that few items be offered as long as they are edible. Being a buffet I was able to try just about everything and found it all to be nothing but terrible. The food was soggy and the flavors were far a cry from what each item was supposed to be. I couldn't keep from making terrible faces as I sampled one dish after another eventually circling the buffet hungry for anything to fill my stomach. Eventually I found luck in mediocre potato's and seasoned fries, both items which I don't normally enjoy--after all I love Chinese food. The worst part was that even the deserts were terrible: dry and anything but sweet. My server asked if everything was okay and didn't respond remotely to my response. I continually looked for a back door from which to dash but grudgingly paid after being held hostage in the worst dining experience of my life."}
{"text":"They changed the name of this restaurant to Crystal Buffet. Not sure if it's the same manager still but the set up looks the same. Came here when it was buy one get one free for dinner (Monday-Wednesday). They gave each person a ticket to redeem a whole lobster. The lobster was dried, overcooked and had a strong seafood smell to it. The actual buffet was okay. They were really good with replenishing empty dishes so the food was always hot. The best thing at this buffet aside from the price is the soya milk. However, I wouldn't come back here even though it was cheap and the service was good because the food just wasn't good."}
{"text":"When I went here, they had the buy one adult buffet, get the second adult free deal (Monday - Wednesday). I was slightly skeptical about this place because of the exterior, it didn't really look like a good establishment on the outside. 

Decor; wasn't that great.

The food however, surprised me. I was expecting terrible food and thought I was going to need my pepto bismol. But that wasn't necessary. Food was alright, it wasn't as westernized as most Chinese buffets are. I think my favorite dish was the schezwan eggplant.
They did have lobster, however they gave each guest one ticket to claim a lobster. It was small, dry, it had this brownish/grey color to it.

So, it was an okay experience. Would I go back? Probably not. Would I recommend others to go to it? Erm.. Maybe not? But I wouldn't stop them from going if they wanted to."}
{"text":"My store had booked this place for our annual party.  Initially I heard that this place was pretty bad but decided to try it after hearing that it was under new management.  To my surprise, it was as bad as what other people told me.

The food (when it was available) was actually worse then cafeteria food.  Many of the items were mis-labelled (e.g. label read Beef Brisket on one side and Chicken with black bean sauce on the other side of the island BUT Deep fried Shrimp was in the hot area).  May cause a serious issue with people that have allergies (potentially fatal actually).

Forget the booze.  The stated price was $3.50 but ended up paying more then $5.00.  When asked the explaination was price of beer+tax+alchohol tax+service charge+tip.  What the PLUS???

One more thing, the seating was pretty bad.  In order to get out, the person next to you had to get up.  The seating setup is very similar to a Marche I went to downtown years ago.  The packed you in like steerage with no room to move around.

Do not recommend this place to anyone with high blood pressure.  If the food doesn't kill you, the stress of moving away from your chair will.

(Less then 1 start rating but they don't allow that here. Pity.)"}
