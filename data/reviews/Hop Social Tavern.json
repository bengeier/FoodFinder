{"text":"I was excited about trying this new place because it had so many good reviews in yelp. I am a foodie and this fell Short of my expectations. The food was probably passable for the younger crowd but neither my daughter or I ate our dinners. The food just wasn't impressive. They were too complicated flavors. The staff was really nice, but our waitress never asked us why we basically left all our food intact and didn't ask for a doggy bag."}
{"text":"Good happy hour food and drinks! really enjoyed the pretzel and the mac and cheese. Happy hour beer selection was good and would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This will be my go to restaurant. The pretzel fondue was to die for!! Seriously, do not pass it up. My son who is a picky eater, really liked his chicken strips. They are made with a buttermilk batter and sooo good. My husband had the Gorgonzola Burger which was huge! It was very good and even better later in the day heated up. I had the spicy Mac and cheese and it was just ok. For me, it lacked a crunchy element. The service was excellent and our server Carrie (sp?) was great, very friendly and attentive. The atmosphere was inviting and there are TV to watch the games. The decor was trending without overdoing it. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Sat in the bar area took a while for anyone to come over or even acknowledge not even that busy. Plenty of the staff & managers just kept walking by.  Finally getting ready to leave a server came and said has anybody been to you yet not even a greeting. In haven't been here before  wanted to know about some items too much in hurry or just didn't care say a little of both. Ordered the blackened chicken pasta friend had roast beef sandwich. The blackened chicken was way way too spicy overwhelming plan pasta no feta a couple leafs of spinach a bad dish. I let the server know when we could find her asked another server for ketchup that didn't happen I asked that server again she was to busy now running food, but we have semi hot food now, OMG really. Are server came finally came over told her about the over spiced chicken not good wanted to order something else ask about fish tacos she told me has some spice I didn't want any. Came out the same way as the chicken spice couldn't believe it didn't eat, such a waste of time & money. We weren't the only ones saying the same, ya think they would fixed.  First time and last time will go here. Staff with no care, friendly attitude. No Thanks"}
{"text":"I. Love. Hop. Social. Tavern. There is STELLAR choice of beer. They have so many beers on tap. Angel is the best bartender I have ever had the pleasure of being served by. She turns bartending into an art form. Even IF this place was trash I would return for her alone. Luckily this place is really great and so is she!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, terrific service, great beer selection, overall fantastic dining experience!"}
{"text":"I loved the beers and thought the happy hour food was fine. I am excited to go back for dinner.

The vibes and my waitress were wonderful. :)"}
{"text":"The food was good. I enjoyed the atmosphere and it's a nice place. The customer service is what knocked stars off. When we first arrived we were greeted by a hostess who was kind and let us know happy hour was in the bar area only. When we got up to the bar, it was packed! One of the only tables open inside was dirty, so my fianc√© kindly asked a waitress (standing right next to us) if they could have it cleaned.. mind you she was busy, so he even acknowledged the fact she was busy and asked once she finished if she could please ask someone to clean the table. The waitress looked at him and didn't even say a word and turned back around. Like really? We were kinda shocked that she literally worked there and didn't have the decency to say a word. Someone ended up cleaning our table right after and we ate our food. We didn't get water refilled or barely checked on. I just wish our first experience was better because we would've returned, we love places like this! But the customer services sucks! Manager didn't care either when we made him aware of the situation, after we finished, paid and we're about to leave. Didn't bother to ask who we were referring to either."}
{"text":"Beer cheese and pretzels tasted like someone dumped a LOT of salt into it. It was completely inedible. We didn't even touch the cheese part and the pretzels were topped with MORE SALT. 

I ordered the buttermilk chicken salad which came dressed with a raspberry vinaigrette - and when I asked about the dressing choice people didn't really seem to know what was printed on the menu. Not only that the cucumbers were soggy and looked like they had been frozen and the salad hadn't even been picked through for bad or off looking pieces. You can tell when someone in the kitchen doesn't really care what kind of food they're putting out and that's what it looked like from our perspective. 

The manager came by to check- her question to me at the table wasn't the best. \"I heard your salad came out with the wrong dressing\" :-/ I was thoroughly unhappy but didn't want to make a big deal about it, I tried to eat it but, it just wasn't good with that raspberry dressing. I thought the manager would comp the salad as a whole seeing as how it was the kitchens fault that it came out wrong but decided to charge me for the chicken. I think she should have just taken it off completely."}
{"text":"Love this place! JJ my neighbor great cook love the set up the donuts the corn fritters need to go try more in the menu worth driving to Chandler"}
{"text":"If I come into Hop Social better believe I'm looking for Angel or Cooper. My husband and I always come here after our shifts to have a good time and get some great cocktails. These two know how to keep it entertaining and I can't imagine coming to the bar without them behind it. Also you can't beat the happy hour just about tried everything but always go back to the steakbites"}
{"text":"It pains me to write a bad review, because I had such high hopes for this place.  We went to Hop Social the first weekend it opened.  My husband and I put in a food order and never received any food after waiting a hour and a half.  Tonight we went again to give it another try.  We were seated right away and then waited for 15 minutes to get water because the hosted seated us in a place that wasn't covered by wait staff.  We put in a food order and waited, and waited and waited.  My husband and child's food was sitting under a warmer for 20 minutes before it came out, because my pizza took so long.  The kung pow chicken was cold, blah and was some chicken and rice.  Thats it.  I ordered the forest mushroom pizza...and it came out with no mushrooms!!!  When we finally were able to tell a manager, they put in a new order and comped both pizzas.  But really, too little, too late.  We will not be giving Hop Social a third chance and I'm really bummed by that."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Service is a little slow but I like the food and the happy hour is awesome. They have a ton of beers on tap and I want to try them all. At once. I know I had some good food but I think I had tee many martoonies so there's that. Mahi tacos were very good for sure. Order it all I say."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time and it was outstanding!  The spicy Mac n cheese was the best ever.  Pear and Gorgonzola salad fantastic.  Service was excellent.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, decent beer list, clean, great service. We ordered the chicken sandwich, caesar salad, and the pastrami and pretzel bun for lunch. We both had the house cut fries as well. Food was decent. My pretzel bun was soggy by the time I got it and both of our fries tasted like they were made hours ago sitting under a hot lamp. They are hard and not fresh. The manager came over and asked us about the food, we told him what our opinions were and he offered to get us new fries, but we were already done eating at that point. He was very nice and accommodating. I did mention to him the lady at the front handing food off to the runners was poking her bare fingers in burgers and grabbing things to fix on plates while handling checks and other things. It was completely grossed out. He said it was normal for them to do that. Based on the quality of the food, it was over priced and I don't want someone's fingers inside my food. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Angel behind the bar is amazing !!! Great service !!! I will defiantly be back !!! Thank you girl !!! 5++"}
{"text":"I've been in a few times. The service has always been prompt and friendly. Beer selection is a little heavy on the IPAs (my favorite) but there is still plenty to choose from and the taps are always changing. 

It's just a beer & wine bar, any outside food is allowed and some local places will deliver. They have some free snacks though!"}
{"text":"Went in on a crazy shopping day to meet a friend/s for lunch. Sat in the bar and had an awesome time. Our server was super friendly and very attentive. We all LOVED our food! My friend enjoyed her gluten-free beer too. We must've had 3 different managers check on us during our visit. We felt cared for and I personally enjoyed my meal immensely. I ordered the Kung pao chicken. My friend had chicken tenders with fries and gravy. I kept stealing hers too. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT experience, we celebrated my moms birthday here, it had great drinks and appetizers! I ordered a veggie burger and I have already revisited.  the waiter was great, even signed a card to give to my mom with a treat on the house!"}
{"text":"The food is super super tasty! And the service is well attend . I recommend the bison burger is my fav !!"}
{"text":"Seems like a pretty cool place, but the staff all come across as pretty snobbish.  Otherwise, drinks are good but a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Beautiful people work there. Beautiful decoration. 
The food tho taste below average. I think the owner forgot to survey around the chandler area and see how competitive and diverse (ethnic food) business in this city. You can't just serve regular bar tasting food. Make your food the reason customer wants to come back!

I suggest the franchise to check out it's competitors nearby(places I would consider going before Hop Social)
- Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen in Chandler. Equally beautify decorated but the food is good and cost much less on drinks. 
- Wildflower Bread Company inside of Chandler mall. Great sandwich and salad options! Fraction of the price. Your competition to lunch crowd.
- Meridiem Kitchen & Lounge. Very nice environment. Great for business meeting and social events!
- And tones of other restaurants in chandler downtown."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends and we had a great time although it was a little bit loud the place was clean the service was good and the options they have fit everyone's pallet. Since it is very close to our home we will definitely be back. Happy a place like this open in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Their menu is definitely versatile. They have everything from calamari to fried chicken. The appetizers are outstanding, but the main courses.... Not so much. 
The servers are always pleasant. However, service is painfully slow."}
{"text":"Love love love love it here!!!
Seriously the best service, best brews, best foods! 
I feel like I could not say enough to express...so just go, try it out!

We have been here twice already:

The soft pretzels are dlish, the artichoke/spinach/cheese dip is rich and creamy, chili Verde nachos were decent. The meat was so good, tender and full of flavor....a little too many chips, proportionately a little off. 
Hubby enjoyed the cabernet tenderloin tips. I tried the sauce it was so rich and tasty.
I had the stuffed gorgonzola burger yum! Cooked perfectly!
Had the beer flight and everyone I tried was awesome!
Can't wait for our next visit"}
{"text":"I like this place but not sure. I have here twice - first time the waitress was friendly and quick. Second time not so much. It could be that we came on a busy night for a Wednesday or the waiter was new. Our waiter was practically absent during the time we were there. Someone from another party seemed to think the bar wasn't spectacular. Most of the wait staff were prompt. How long do you think it should to bring a ginger ale? It took maybe 20-30 minutes for my drink & 45 minutes for my sandwich. The waiter didn't come to update us. I'm not convinced yet and will update this review when I come again."}
{"text":"My husband and I were so excited to see this place was open and to try it. Unfortunately it didn't live up to the hope. We sat on the outdoor patio (open seating) at 2pm on a Sunday - it was not busy. About 1/3 of the tables had people at them. 

Menu: great list of items and excellent beer list!

Service: unbelievably slow!!! Order for drinks and apps went in in good time. 15 minutes later we had to flag down our waiter and tell him we wanted to place an order for food. All drinks seemed to fly out quickly. Unfortunately our beer flight had beer spilled in all the holes - sloppy. Our appetizer (spinach dip and chips) came 30 minutes later which was a little slow but ok.  

The poor part was that we didn't get our food (hamburger and salad) until 3pm. Our waiter came and said \"I don't know what's going on with the kitchen\". No apology, no comped drinks or app. I was disappointed. Our waiter came outside only once ever 15 minutes which meant no water refills. I do have to say it looked like the waiter was working his tail off inside, just didn't pay as much attention to his 2 outside tables. He gave us the bill and within 1 minute we put the credit card on it. It wasn't picked up for 15 minutes (no joke, I timed it). 

Price: overpriced. My salad was $14 and to be honest the two small pieces of breaded chicken were cold.  The salad itself was arugula dressed with a nice dressing (although the blackberry seeds  can feel like their nearly break your teeth) and sprinkled with cheese with 2 black berries. To me this salad was barely worth $10. To top it off, it cost the same as my husbands burger and fries."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place that is a mixture of hip sports bar, craft beer bar and great pub food, this is the place.  As someone who has worked in the hospitality industry and dined in likely hundreds of different brewpubs in sports bars, I think this one is at that benchmark that the others should aspire to be.

Here are the winners: The craft beer selection isn't the biggest, but I would say it's fairly diverse and very open to those that may not have ever had a craft beer.  If you are looking for a foreign beer, this isn't the place. They do have a few bottles, but 99.9% of the beer they sell is draft beer from the US, with quite a large number from Arizona.

The food: my wife and I got two different burgers from their menu and I will say that the presentation was fantastic but what preceded the burgers was even better. We got their homemade hot fresh donuts as an appetizer. Do yourself a favor, get these and have a nice dark but sweeter style beer with it. I recommend the Dawn of the Red by Ninkasi. The taste of the dough with the cinnamon and the nice crisp outer crust was great but then the warm dipping sauce that they give you just made it fantastic.

As for the burgers, my wife got a bourbon burger and I got a Gorgonzola stuffed burger. Both were cooked perfectly, the burgers tasted very fresh, the buns were exceptional and the fries that accompanied it were not standard shoe string or ribbon fries, they were Oil fries along the lines of those produced by folks like 5 Guys but without an overpowering seasoning.

Something of note for the beer crowd: the draft lines were obviously very clean simply by the way the beer taste in the glass and the glasses were beer clean. Beautiful lacing on all of the glasses, no noticeable odors whatsoever coming off of them and I was extremely impressed with the only exception that you get offered a larger size, a tall, and I was a bit put off by that because of the size of the glass only because I wanted a more traditional style glass for an IPA.  But again, the glass was beautiful, it was clean and it was done right.

Finally, our server, Ashley, was fantastic. Polite, timing could not have been better, nice recommendations, but she wasn't hovering and made us feel welcome even though it was our only our first visit. All the servers were extremely polite and well-dressed but casual in their tops and nice jeans; the place is impeccable down to the cleanliness of the bathrooms and even the glass on the front door.

For those that may not like beer, there is a short wine list but a fantastic cocktail list including handcrafted cocktails. The place is a total win."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. We sat at the bar, the bartender gave a solid recommendation on food and beer. The staff was very friendly and the service was great. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place after hearing great things, but at as another reviewer said, it fell short of my expectations. First of all, the wait time to get our food was borderline absurd considering the restaurant was far from busy. It took about 20 minutes for a starter salad and about 40 minutes for a salad and burger. The side for the burger was delayed too. One of the items came out wrong and while we kept it anyways (we were super hungry after the long wait) there was no offer to remake or a discount on our check. As someone who comes from the restaurant industry, that was disappointing. Contrary to other posts though, I did think the food was good. And the staff was nice."}
{"text":"Staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Had an amazing mushroom pizza last time we were here. The only complaint came from the kid who doesn't like mayo"}
{"text":"We love this place... great selection of beer, the food is fantastic, the atmosphere is friendly with very good service, and the pricing is just right. We bring guests here all the time since they've opened because it's unique, casual, and the food is yummy."}
{"text":"New, replaced Elephant Bar.
Was surprised they had a multitude of options which was nice.

I thought the sushi (California) roll was nice and the side sauce was awesome!

My son had fish and chips and the fish was ok and the fried were greasy s. We traded for asparagus but it was burnt. 

I am sure as they get more into their groove they will improve."}
{"text":"This is a big, nice, beautiful space with plenty of bar and patio along with regular seating.  There's like 50+ beers on tap, a ton of them are local too which is great (and real local, not Four Peaks' fake ass version of local) and so if you're just drinking then this place is probably more like a 4 star.

But their food is kinda iffy.  The steak bites are...ok.  It's just steak and balsamic with too much steak seasoning but it isn't bad for the price.  Don't order the artichoke dip though, christ.  It was like greenish Elmer's Glue.  

Some other reviewer said the meals aren't great and while I didn't order much else in the way of food, the stuff that I saw I tend to agree didn't look great.  I hate the fact that I'm agreeing with that reviewer though because they started off by saying \"I'm a foodie\" which might as well be the same as saying \"I'm a bland and boring piece of crap who thinks the fact that I eat food makes me special\".  Seriously, stop calling yourselves foodies, people, you look like assholes.

Anyway, this place has the potential to be pretty good but that menu has to get better.  Earn your extra stars, Hop Social.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I came here with my family last night to try something new, we ordered two burgers and a chicken sandwich... The food took an hour to come out, and all three orders were wrong. I kept mine because I don't care enough to send food back (I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with the aioli the side, it came with no sauce, bacon on the side, and entirely cold) My father had an entirely wrong entr√©e, and my mother's food was burnt. I finished my meal and waited with them for 30 minutes until having to leave for another commitment, their food had still not arrived at this point. I later heard that my mom's food was equally as burnt as the first go round but my dad's order was all right. In the end my parents were not charged for their food, but the bill was $24 for my sandwich and a single well gin drink before tip. The drink was literally doubled the price we have seen at any other restaurant.

They have a wide beer selection which is nice, I wish they offered sours though. If you are going out to drink then this is probably your place, but spending over 2 hours for bad food is definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"Everything was pretty good! Reliable service and something on the menu for everyone. 

You might be tempted to get a burger or one of the usuals on the menu BUT I have to say the Kung Pao Chicken was one of the best I ever had. Not too deep fried or too spicy, it was perfect. I still think about it sometimes. So if you're willing to order out of the box get one of the Asian fusion dishes, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Delicious Bison Burger, Lots of choices on the food and beverage menu.  Great opportunity to watch sports or people...enjoyed some time on the patio.  Ambiance music is complimentary to all ages! The staff are very attentive and friendly. I will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"We love Chelsea the day bartender!!! She has the best personality, so friendly and great service! We go see her at least once a week now! Great food and atmosphere"}
{"text":"Another average place for happy hour in Chandler. Nothing really bad but nothing luring me in for a repeat visit either. 

I met up with my friends here a few weeks ago and sat out on the large patio. Our server was a nice guy who was happy to put in a food order for our friend who was on her way and put in her drink order the second she arrived so she could take advantage of happy hour too. 

We shared the artichoke dip to start, and it had me longing for the stuff they sell at Costco. The fries were slightly better but nothing special. That's all I tried at Hop Social since there aren't many other vegetarian options. 

The best part of the evening was the cider I got on draft. It was very tasty, and my friend got an order too after having a sip of mine. I'm not a beer drinker at all so I appreciate that they had 3 ciders on tap. For my second drink, I got their happy hour margarita, and I was less impressed. Stick with the taps!"}
{"text":"Wow!  What a great new hotspot for the Tempe/East Valley area.  Fun atmosphere with plenty of good conversation accompanied by tasty food and a wide verity of drinks to choose from."}
{"text":"We walked in to see what was going on a few months ago..they were having a \"soft opening\" and we were blown away by the atmosphere they created, the friendly staff and crazy menu...all great. Can't say enough. Oh, and our new Best Burger Perfection in town. Did I mention the home made fries? Thanks, David and Family."}
{"text":"This is a brand new bar/restaurant..it's 5 stars because somebody really knows how to hire. Inside ,outside ,more inside ,more outside seating., fire pits, couches..first class build out..could be best in this area. Full size wrap around bar and most importantly standing bars for when it's crowded. The sound system and ceiling noise dampeners are well done. Great sound , loud but not too loud..full sound. Wonderful employees. They are really assembling a great group. Be patient, it's a new place with new people, let them work the kinks out..sheesh. Order your drink or food and just chillLevi, Chelsea..thanks for the effort to answer our many ??. Beer choices are many, some are great. 52 craft beers. Glasses need to be cold for every pour, not just when it's slow. The prices are excellent for the food amount. The bacon wrapped meatloaf was excellent, real potatoes were mashed. The gravy..tasty but just not sure where it is going. Either it needs to be tomato based or gravy or just something else...a real winner though..ended with donuts..delicious!"}
{"text":"From Oregon.  Really wanted to like restaurant since from NW.  Friend who had strawberry salad said best salad EVER!  And he's old.  Two others had salmon - Scandinavian farm raised silver salmon, so not distinct flavor.  Mine was overcooked and very bland.  Other choice was sweet mustard sauce - too sweet.  Opted for sides of mashed potatoes and veg of day (NO kale), which were mushy baby reds - note to owners:  waxy potatoes should NOT be smashed because you end up with mushy mess.  Asparagus was mostly yellow and stringy... overcooked and old.  Interior stark modern with big green sofa/banquet bench in middle of room, cheap tables and chairs.  One huge open room = noisy when busy.  Have a salad or a burger, go for huge beer menu (have several I need to try), and if you want to talk, steer clear of busy times.  Lose the *&@#$% kale!!!!!"}
{"text":"A lot of beer on tap.  If you are a beer lover go here.  The food wasn't too bad either.  This is your typical fancy (high end) pub.  We started with the nachos, which were great.  I moved on to the french dip which didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant inside with nice ambiance and TVs for sports! Kale salad and chicken Marsala were delicious. Friendly staff as well.... Chandler needs more places like this!!"}
{"text":"We chose this place as the location to meet my best friend and her new beau and couldn't have chosen better. First off, the layout and setup are awesome. The vibe works well for those who are looking for a fun bar vibe (at the bar area), group dining, or for a more quiet area in the back so you can have great conversation. 

We met them on a Saturday night and made a reservation. Our server was phenomenal - well versed in the menu, sarcastic and prompt. She let us know when to get our orders in after a large party was sat to ensure that we didn't have to wait too long. She also encouraged us to sample certain beers after asking what type of beers we liked to find new kinds of beers we could like. I tried a beer that tasted great but definitely had a clorox aftertaste (just the way the beer is brewed) and we all had a good laugh about that. We ordered beer and appetizers, all were absolutely delicious. The boys got pretzels and we got the spinach dip. 

For dinner, I had the poke, Brittany had the pasta, fiance had the shepherd's pie and Matt had fried chicken. 

The food, drinks and desserts were incredible. Atmosphere was great, and service was a 10/10. We would definitely return and can't wait to try more of what they have to offer."}
{"text":"Had the fish and chips, the best part of the meal was the chips. Fish is frozen... enough said if you like eating rubbery fish that has been fried you will LOVE this meal if you enjoy tasting your food skip this version of fish and chips."}
{"text":"In town enjoying the warm weather for my Birthday weekend. Could not be happier that we stumbled across Hop Social on Yelp and took the leap of faith! Amazing patio, food, drinks and the donuts!!! Great social scene to boot. Go, you will love it!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food, decor, location, awesome beer selection, and service. My only issue was sitting at the bar...the bar stools all wobble as if you're sitting on a spring and make you feel drunk just sitting there. Other than that, no issues."}
{"text":"Why did I wait so long to come back here!?  I first came here during their soft opening and really enjoyed the food.  So when my friend suggested another restaurant in the area, I suggested we go to Hop Social since she had never been.  We looked at the menu and decided to split the Strawberry Pear Apple Salad and the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger.  When ordering we told the waitress that we were going to split the meals.  Now normally this means that we get extra plates.  We we received our meals they were actually split in half.  Each of us received a plate with half a burger and some fries, and a small salad in a bowl (which looked beautiful!).  

Our waitress was friendly, checked up on us regularly and our glasses were never empty!  I'm not going to wait so long to go back!"}
{"text":"The scratch made food is really good and the staff is awesome! I love draft beer and they have tons of it."}
{"text":"I give this place about 18 months-2 years and then it will burn and fail...great d√©cor , terrible prices!, ok food, decent service, nothing special to set it apart from Bennigans, Chili's, or half a dozen other corporate themed restaurants...too bad as the location is good..it is so sad to see this bland , no personality, nothing unique spot be done over and over again...think: I am form out of town and I ate a place that did nothing to create a memory....that is Hop Social Tavern in a nutshell."}
{"text":"We went after work with a table of 8.  The service varied from attentive to absent but she also had three other large tables on the go.  Everyone enjoyed their food...we would have drank a lot more (and tipped a lot more) had the server been more focused on follow up.  Overall, the renovations look great, the food and beer was awesome and with some time, I'm sure the service will improve too."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative star I would. Ordered the salmon and after the second bite I realized it was spoiled. My husband being brave decided to try it, he was smart and spit it out. Poor waitress when she told the manager we watched him smell it and nod. Sent her back to tell us they won't charge us for it! REALLY!? You served a customer bad fish and the manager doesn't even come over to apologize. No offer to get us something else (which we would have declined as now all I can think about is the night ahead with food poisoning). Nothing we had was worth the trip. The poke tuna appetizer was a huge mound of rice with a little ahi (in retrospect probably a blessing knowing the quality of fish). It came with a small over cooked piece of wonton when we asked for more the waitress came back with two little broken pieces and said \"if you need the cook can make some fresh ones\" REALLY why would you not start with fresh ones!?  The menu is all over the place from wood fire pizzas, stir fry, tacos, burgers, steaks, pastas pot pie and meatloaf it makes no sense.  Figure out what you do well (not the fish obviously) but quality and do it right. This place will never last! Don't waste your time go to Maerles or Firebird next door, you won't get food poisoning."}
{"text":"Food is great, staff excellent.  I personally just prefer a quieter place."}
{"text":"This will forever be the place I associate with thinking 'how can you screw-up cheesecake'.

The location is great, the atmosphere is great, reservation keeping is phenomenal, table waiting for us rather than just being prioritized for the next one on arrival, and you're greeted by the friendliest people on the planet.

The wait-staff have long lost their ability to give a f**k. I had no clue this place had a full bar, the waitress never gave us a drinks menu. When clearing the table next to us, the waiter dropped silverware and just kicked it under the table, which was never picked up even when the next people were seated there.

3 times manager-type people stopped by to see how we were doing, the first time, I admit (Dave) I said nothing to you. I should have, my burger was about raw. We did mention it to the next manager type woman that came by who offered to warm it up after she saw what it looked like on the inside, but I declined and just charged on hoping for a good dessert.

Oh boy... dessert, the apple cobbler (I think it was cobbler) was great apparently, which is what my partner got. I got the cheesecake. I don't know how you screw up cheesecake, but they managed to find a way to make it taste like rubber. When manager type #3 (bald man with glasses) asked how dessert was, I replied 'terrible', to which I got the surreal answer \"I know right!, let's torch the place! Okay you guys, have a good meal.\" and then he left.

We won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Good food, friendly staff, awesome beer selection. The pot pie is the owner's family recipe. The steak salad is amazing!"}
{"text":"I got a to go order at lunch. The service was great, the environment seems fun and trendy. I wasn't impressed with the blacken chicken pasta. It was very oily and the Cajun seasoning was a little salty. However I will give it a second chance perhaps for happy hour."}
{"text":"Had lunch. Very good food. Buttermilk fried chicken was tasty, a tiny bit too much salt but crispy & chicken moist. The hamburger was very good. Absolutely order the corn fritter appetizer: DIVINE!
Pleasant staff"}
{"text":"Attractive restaurant in the old Elephant Grill facility. They have 52 craft beers on tap but it's odd they have don't have prices listed. Happy hour which is just ok on drink specials is $1.00 off each beer...but it's a $1.00 off what? They have just two wines for Happy Hour. Service is not so great...saw our server once and we had to ask another server to take our order. So many choices in the area...not sure if we will come back.."}
{"text":"Meh. We ordered a pizza and a couple of beers. We enjoyed the pizza, but weren't impressed with anything else, especially the service. They do have a nice beer selection, but these days who doesn't?"}
{"text":"We have had positive experiences with both food and service in the past. Today the food was good however, the service was not on par. Didn't appreciate snarky comment from server about my family. Will return, but rubbed the wrong way this afternoon."}
{"text":"The first time we tried to eat here was on a Tuesday night, the wait was 45 minutes, so we decided to check it out the following week. The staff was nice, and we were seated promptly. My husband and I both got the pot pie, and it came out quickly, and it was very delicious. We couldn't get over how big the portion was. We took a slice of cheesecake home to eat later that evening, that was amazing as well. 

My only complaint is there is no refill on the ice teas. We ordered a few refills and were surprised to see $14 of our bill was for iced tea. Our waiter never mentioned that refills weren't free like most restaurants do. I am sure we will be back again, and I am hoping for another good experience."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I heard about this new restaurant opening so close to home.  We ate there last night with our adult children.  The service was great--super attentive and quick service.  The decor is very attractive.  But our food was not good.  My son's fried chicken was so mushy that he was afraid it was not cooked all the way through, and it was very salty.  My fish taco had very little fish in it, which was also soggy with little flavor.  One daughter thought her club sandwich was okay, but not exciting, and our other daughter said her ribs were okay.  Same with Hubby's burger.  All the fries were served cold!  I would have said something to the server, but my kids get embarrassed, lol. On top of all that, it was SO LOUD that we could barely hear each other.
I guess we'll keep trekking to Phoenix to Angel Trumpet Ale House and to Gilbert to Wilderness Brewing, where the food and beers are tasty and a fair price."}
{"text":"First experience here was great! The service was great and so was the food. Plenty of tvs at the bar to watch games and they have great happy hour options- I tried the beer flight since I was unfamiliar with some of the beers. One of my new favorite spots in chandler."}
{"text":"Honestly such an amazing experience here! I had been in here one time before and really enjoyed it however this time exceeded my expectations. From the food to the drinks we enjoyed every piece of our meal, and our waitress, Bri, was most accommodating. The real selling point was the manager, Joe, that came to our table and checked on us. He had a genuine conversation with us about my husbands hat (he was wearing a Modern Times hat). After this he came by with 3 beers for my husband to try from Modern Times! How amazing is that! I mean honestly haven't had that great of service in a while!  Will 100% be back very soon! 

PS- Get the meatloaf or pot pie! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I walked in and asked if they had a gluten-free menu. I was told by the two hostess that they don't have free food. I explained I wasn't asking for a handout. The manger asked what do you want. I said it's my first time here. I haven't read the menu yet.  This was not a good start. They have no items marked as gluten free. The manger had no knowledge of the menu.  Said he had to talk to the chief who hasn't developed a gluten-free menu yet.  The manger never came back. We left."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, incredible food, awesome happy hour food/prices and great atmosphere! This place never disappoints and this is our favorite go-to hangout! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here for my birthday! Amazing customer service. Great seating area. If you like beer this is a great place for you...there's something like 50 beers on tap. Really great food. Manager brought me an ice cream Sunday! Overall great experience."}
{"text":"This place just opened not too long ago and I've already been here twice. Both times our waitress was so friendly and helpful! Even the manager was walking around making sure every guest there was happy. The ambiance is super fun and the food was really good! I also had an awesome beer but can't remember the name of it."}
{"text":"Great place, among a plethora of shops bars and restaurants. Busy, crowded but plenty of seating. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Great burger....fries are well...some fast food joints serve up fries that make their fries look silly."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Second time here. Had a variety of things to eat. All were wonderful. We made a reservation on a Friday night when there was an hour wait and were seated immediately when we arrived. Our server greeted us with a free app, the manager stopped by during the meal, the beer list is impressive. This may be our new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Disappointed because we wanted to love it. 

Server was upbeat and personable. She gave her opinions on some food items when we asked and we appreciated her honesty.

Beer selection is large. Not sure you are going find limited release taps here, for example. I was hoping to discover and try something new, but it was ok for what we wanted.

They brought the side salad for my husband after his burger came.  Should have come before his entree.

They forgot to make my dinner and they didn't realize it until my family was almost halfway through their meals. When the server came back to tell me it would still be a few more minutes, I told her to cancel my dinner order. Instead, I could just eat off my child's plate. I really was not upset, as my child did not like the dish much anyway and my husband said his food was nothing special so I figured we could save $15 and not waste my child's food. Then the manager came out and said she still wanted to make it. That was nice but I already said no so then I felt like I was being rude. After we were done with dinner, they made a card for my child and brought her an ice cream sundae as a special surprise. That was lovely, but I couldn't tell if that was for her or for my benefit.

Patterns in the reviews make me believe that the kitchen is the main problem. Several complaints of salads and apps coming with main courses, food being cold, etc. Our server even said \"The kitchen is a mess tonight.\" Hmmmn."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a friend to try something new in the Chandler area. Hop Social definitely has an inviting and unique look unlike most restaurants in the area. Their menu had so much to offer, even for a vegetarian like me. Our waitress, Erika, was one of the most personable and welcoming servers I've had in my dining experience. She was so accommodating and very honest in her opinions of the food and drinks they serve. Our food came out in an impressive amount of time and tasted delicious. From the customer service, their staff, and overall atmosphere, I can confidently say I will back for some good eats and drinks from Hop Social!"}
{"text":"The beer and food tasted fine. The bar is dirty. Sat outside looking into the bar itself. There were small flies of sorts but couldn't tell if they were from inside or outside. Saw the bartender and waitress pulling several things out from drinks with straws  before serving the drinks to the customers. Saw one waitress scratching something off the ice scoop with her fingers while the bartender watched. They didn't clean the scoop and continued to use it to serve drinks. Bartender seemed to be interested in the waitresses then seeing if we wanted more drinks. Overall it felt like they just didn't care."}
{"text":"After just moving to Chandler we wanted to try some local places and so we went to Hop Social for their happy Hour! Their alcoholic drinks were pretty awesome and such a reasonable price even off the happy house menu. We also split a barbecue chicken flat bread on the happy hour menu, it was pretty good, maybe could've used a little more barbecue sauce, but overall pretty darn good especially for the price! Servers are not overly friendly or efficient, but I think the atmosphere makes of up that. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We came her before a Spring Training game.  Staff was great at suggesting meals to try, since there were so many options. Environment was great, if we didn't have plans we would have stayed longer for another drink."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place; it's a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  Quality food, excellent beer selection, and hip vibe."}
{"text":"great place and great selection of beer for the flight"}
{"text":"This place is so fun! We live nearby and noticed how busy it always seemed after opening, so had to stop by and try it out. The decor is a funky, retro industrial and the inside is a huge, open concept floorplan. They have a huge food & drink menu. Would definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"Went there on New's Year's Eve.  Think the owner(s) were in town checking out their newest creation. They have years and years of family restaurant businesses.  (I heard Farrell's Ice Cream Parlor was their creation in 1962 from Portland).

Our bartender was friendly and made my wife an amazing chocolate or coffee martini.  They other bartender wanted to make another since she jokingly bragged \"hers was better\".  It was a fun way of getting us to order another martini. Everyone was cool.

Great remodel of the former restaurant.  
Great local and not-so local craft beer line up.  

If the prices of beer were a bit better, I would go back more often.

Sounds weird, but on the app menu, not for dessert, you must order the donuts.  Perfect with a beer!"}
{"text":"Second time visiting.  First time was for a happy hour and today was lunch with co-workers. Ahi Poke is yummy. Ginger on the side was the best I ever tasted, I could have had a bowl of that stuff! Fish tacos are below average (I would suggest a better sauce). I received the same slow service both times I have come here, slow service from both the wait staff and the kitchen.  I get that this is a scratch kitchen, but a work lunch should not take 2 hours. I think this place has a great shot at being a local favorite if they improve their service."}
{"text":"I have no other way to describe this restaurant than with one word: phenomenal!!! My friend and I came in for a quick beer and bite. We didn't expect to have the best service ever (always ask for Sarah Monday - Friday, she's perfect) and to eat the most amazing food ever. Honestly, I was so happy with everything I put in my mouth. If you want the best dessert ever, try their donuts. Because dear baby Jesus, I almost cried when I took the first bite."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. Always a great experience. We especially love Cooper the bartender. Remembers us and has a fantastic personality. And I know his parents love music! LOL The good is alway exceptional! This place has become our go to place!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this place tonight food was amazing service from Angel was Top Notch. The steak bites meatloaf and donut balls are must have. One of my new favorite places"}
{"text":"OMG!!!!! ANGEL! ...is my new best friend..Her Martinis are Awesome!!!!..She made me a blueberry martini ,
..Im in love,....But then she made a pear martini for my husband....Okkkk Im in Love all over again again!!!!lolololo..She is awesome..
 Also the service was Awsome and we were sitting at the bar... Shout out also to Stephanie who made me and the hubby the first drink which was the passiondrop martini (wildberry )!!!!!!!!!!!loveeeee .. food was great too!. 

ANGEL!!! I WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour! 3-6 and a really nice selection of moderately priced food. The thing I enjoyed most was the selection. Normally, with a happy hour at a bar and grill, you get basic bar food. But their happy hour menu includes full meals...like a cheeseburger for only $5.95. 
Came in with a party of 5 for drinks and snacks, and ended up ordering 6 or 7 different appetizers. Everything was good, but I really enjoyed the nachos! You won't be disappointed.
Only reason for 4 stars rather than 5 was the prices on the beer. Though they have an impressive selection of beers on tap, only a small number were included in the happy hour specials, and those were still $4.50 (I think). To be honest, I'm not certain how much I paid for the beers I did have, but for a couple appetizers and a few beers, I didn't feel like I got an amazing deal.
The good news is, the food was all really good, the beer was COLD, which I appreciate, the decor was nice. All in all, a great new place. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I first have to say I will be coming back.

The reason as to why I did not give a full 5 stars is because we made a reservation and we came in with a party of four when they went to seat us she took us to a table that was fairly small that only had two chairs at it. The hostess just had us crowed around the table while they found us extra chairs (which seemed very difficult to them) we ended up asking if we could switch tables because it was a small table and because we didn't want to stand around and wait for our chairs. 

Other than the issue with the chairs, our waitress was amazing came back multiple times to ask if we needed any drinks. She recommended a lot of different types of foods that were popular which was nice as well. The food came out fairly quickly for how busy it was. I would definitely recommend to make a reservation before coming in since it is busy all of the time. I thought all of the ladies that worked there were extremely nice and helpful, again besides the issue we had with the original table."}
{"text":"I honestly wanted to like this place - 3 stars is probably generous. After two visits, I have some solid complaints about the food and the customer service. 

First of all, it's really loud. Even after the noise dampeners it's still difficult to hear the people at your table. Secondly, it's freezing in this place. Second visit and still ridiculously cold. 

The food overall is pretty tasty. The corn fritters were dry and the sauce is way too sweet. We've been twice and had the orange chicken (pretty solid, small portion for the cost), chicken sandwich (pass - it's nothing to write home about and mine was incredibly salty), the Mac and cheese (probably the best thing we had here period. Would recommend), and the steak salad (pretty good but borderline salty again and difficult to eat). 

The servers, while nice, are not attentive enough. Additionally, my biggest complaints are the fact that all the food came out together - the cup of soup, appetizer and all the entrees. Huge pet peeve of mine. When our entrees came out, my steak salad was ice cold and had clearly been sitting for a WHILE. The restaurant remade it warm but no apology was made and no alteration to the bill. My husband was done with his pasta before my remade meal even arrived. 

Overall, I think it's still a work in progress. Potential but I'd like to see a lot of these things change before coming back - especially for the price point."}
{"text":"We came at 8pm on a Friday night so we were expecting service to be less than stellar being busy. There was a woman, who I believe was a manager of some sort, who was so friendly and picked up slack of waiters. Waited 45 minutes for food and didn't get the appetizer we ordered. I had someone else come by to get refills and when I asked a question on a drink I received a response of \"I don't drink alcohol\" - a little shocking to not be educated on what you are serving. Our waiter was sub par and I would believe that to be the case even if they were slow. Food and drinks were good. We will definitely come back just looking forward to trying when slower."}
{"text":"A friendly crew and good food.  The menu has a lot to offer and will bring me back.  I stopped in for a quick salad to go and very much enjoyed my strawberry/pear and apple salad.

The Elephant Bar had been a location of choice for me for a long time but this new concept and food selection will keep me returning to a familiar address.  The staff and management seem to work well together and together they offer a great experience to the customer."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Reasonably priced. Owners come around to make sure everything is good. More staff than typically bar, so you never have to wait long."}
{"text":"Another team builder happy hour for work! They had great happy hour specials for food and drink. The patio was cozy and the ambiance relaxing. Would definitely go here again on my own! I will say the food is half par for the cost. Would probably just stop in for a drink!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 8 - were seated quickly & all had a good time 

Extensive beer selection

Wide variety menu to please large groups 

The appetizer nachos are HUGE. Absolutely delicious. So much meat, cheese, cilantro, and general heavenliness."}
{"text":"Love the menu, love the atmosphere,  and the beer selection. Have tried many things. Veggie burger is my fave. And the chicken pot pie...yum."}
{"text":"This establishment was only ok. We sat at the bar and there were so many bartenders that we couldn't simply enjoy our drinks before someone was \"checking in\" with us. Definitely the opposite issue of many places. The many beers on tap are mostly Arizona breweries. The food was good, but nothing special to report. We will it make an effort to return."}
{"text":"Pretty great place! Loved the atmosphere. Our server was very nice and helpful. The kids loved their food as did my husband. I tried his fried chicken sandwich and wow was it good. The gravy that is served with it is amazing, I could literally drink it by itself. My dish was mediocre at best. I had the blackened chicken feta pasta dish. The server did say it was a tad spicy. I don't like spicy food so she recommended plain chicken breast. I got the dish and there was hardly any sauce. What I was tasting was very bland and honestly boring. I asked for more sauce and they accommodated. The sauce was wine based so that was the consistency. It was very light in flavor which explains why the dish is bland. Would I order it again, no but the food I saw at other tables looked amazing. If you are looking for a light dish then this is the one for you however. The server took my dish off the bill without us asking her too. That was greatly appreciated. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. 

Our server was Bri; some little blonde girl, seems harmless. Ordered a cup of soup for my mom and a salad for myself to start which never came out. Our entrees, a dinner salad and a pizza, came out first  so we had to ask the food runner about our original side salad and cup of soup which they said they would go grab. By the time my salad came I had already grubbed out on a slice of pizza. what's even the point of having the salad? We asked about why our food came out backwards and the server said \"the kitchen just does whatever they want.\" Okay, nice. I feel more comfortable after that answer. Yeah, no. 

I only came here because my mom wanted to come here. I honestly would have rather spent a cool $60 somewhere else. 

2/10 would not recommend. 
The place looks nice but the service could be way better. Food is decent. Pizza wasn't a total waste. Salads were actually really good. My mom said her drink got poured with a heavy hand so you win some and you lose some. Maybe if I drank I wouldn't have been so bummed out about the service. Not sure though and I won't be coming back to find out. ?"}
{"text":"We were really pleasantly surprised by Hop Social. We stopped by during Happy Hour on a whim before going to a movie at the nearby theatre. I had visited the building previously when it was still Elephant bar and was curious to see what it looked like now. The place looks completely different now.
At first, I was worried that we would be late as the place was rather crowded. That wasn't the case at all. We were informed the Happy Hour menu was only available at the bar and on the patio, so we sat on the patio. The set-up out there is really nice. Large shades block the view of the parking lot and the cushion seats and high top tables create a really welcoming environment. The misters helped with the spring heat.
We were promptly greeted and ordered our beers. The beer menu is fantastic and I was able to get one of my all time favorites from a smaller brewery (Tower Station IPA from Mother Road Brewery in Flagstaff). We ordered three different dishes from the Happy Hour menu - the fish tacos, Kung Pao lettuce cups and the steak dish. Everything was brought out really quickly despite how busy they were. We were able to get a really decently sized dinner out of these three dishes as the items on the Happy Hour menu are full-sized. 
Overall, we really enjoyed Hop Social. We were able to get four beers and three dishes for under $40. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food was really good, we went on a Saturday night and it was pretty busy, we ordered our food and it took 45 minutes before it came out, the waitress never refilled our waters and didn't apologize for the long wait until I brought up the issue and asked why our food was taking so long. Our food finally came out but they only brought 3 plates out of the 4, and the 4th plate was the same order as the 3rd, and it didn't come out till 5 minutes after the first 3 got to us. Just really bad service. The waitress was nice but just didn't seem to concerned about the food taking that long. The atmosphere was cool and the food was good but the service was a major disappointment."}
{"text":"Im a fan! Tons of beer options and consistently good food with diverse options. Definitely worth checking out"}
{"text":"If I could give 10 stars I would.  We came here to celebrate my sisters 40th bday.  They went above and beyond to make it special.  They were super organized, efficient and the food and drinks were AMAZING!!!  Can't say enough great things"}
{"text":"Great staff and amazing food! Have had wonderful service every time we sit at the bar. Wonderful, fun, and great environment"}
{"text":"Best place to have great food and with amazing beer choices!  Their happy hour is awesome from 3pm to 6pm and they also do a reverse HH."}
{"text":"Favorite place for happy hour! Such an impressive amount of options and so delicious! Highly recommend the steak bites, soft baked pretzels, spinach artichoke dip, and the donuts (so good!). Will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Great new place to have a drink with some friends.
I recommend going in early it can fill up fast."}
{"text":"I've been there 3 times since they've opened. The  Chandler mall area has been lacking exactly this for so long. There are so many chains around the mall with lack luster food and average decor. Not the case with hop social. The restaurant is gorgeous and the food is delicious. Yes, one of the times it took a few more minutes than expected for my husband's beer, but the server was very apologetic and took the beer off the tab. I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews. Everyone I've bought here loves it. We will be back very soon."}
{"text":"I am not sure why I didn't come to this place earlier. I was pleasantly surprised how nice it was redone in here after it used to be the elephant bar. They really brightened it up in there and the decorations are nice. TVs are nicely located to watch sports. I dig how they have couches in use to. Beer selection was good and the food options were nice to. I had the grilled chicken sandwich which was good. Nothing that blew my mind but I liked it and would get again if I was in the mood for one. Staff was very friendly and I would defiantly recommend."}
{"text":"We attempted a few times to check this place out but we weren't able to find a parking spot. Decided go go during the day on the weekend & had no problem getting in. FYI: you can make reservations on Open Table. It's a free app. We ordered a few drinks and each got a burger. I went with the pb&j burger and added bacon. My boyfriend got the stuffed gorgonzola burger. Both were amazing but be aware, they were both messy, lol. Their fries are really good too. Everything tasted fresh. I would higher recommend both. For drinks I had the salted caramel martini and my boyfriend had the Irish trail. Our bill was $46.47 before tip. Both were good. Definetely would go back."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal, delicious food, great service- such a pleasant experience - can't wait until we get a chance to come and try other things on the menu. Flavorful sauces, \"homemade\" goodness, and quality ingredients. Meals are not \"pre-made\", trucked in frozen and set under a warmer. Meal set Hop Social apart from all the other local beer brewery/tavern places. I had the steak tips in a delicious sauce. I recommend this specialty! We also had the Chicken Pot Pie - absolutely out of this world!!"}
{"text":"Totally our kind of place. Reasonably-priced. Tons of option (pizza, kung pao chicken, burgers) and fairly normal food (no fru fru stuff.) The fresh-baked cookie for dessert was really good, although could have filled the pan and bit a bit more chocolatey. Really friendly group too."}
{"text":"Stopped by tonight after planning visit all week.  They were closed due to a computer issue.  Really?  There is no Plan B or contingency plan for such issues?  There should be...."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about Hop Social. Went for the first time a week ago. We were a party of 4 and sat in the bar area because it was very busy as it was a Friday night. The food took quite some time to come out once we ordered but our server made up for it as she kept the drinks coming and provided excellent service overall. The owner David came by our table and checked in on us. He was very nice. He shared the story behind opening the restaurant. 

So for the food...I ordered the fried chicken dinner. The chicken and the potatoes were delicious! The cole slaw was terrible. And I love cole slaw so I was a bit disappointed. There was too much dressing (Miracle Whip and not mayonnaise maybe??). My daughter ordered the burger. It was very dry and meat was almost crumbly. Hubby had the Chile Verde nachos. Loaded with meat and very tasty. Huge portion! He loved it. He also liked the huge variety of beers on tap. 

Ambiance was nice. Large bar area and 2 different patios if you want to sit outdoors. 

Fast forward about a week later. We visited for the 2nd time at 4:30 pm or so on Saturday. It wasn't nearly as busy as our first visit. Plenty of open tables when we were seated. Hubby ordered the fish tacos and enjoyed it. He also had a California roll. Said you could tell it was fresh. I had the fried chicken again although I really wanted to try the pot pie. In hindsight, maybe I should have. My son in law also ordered the fried chicken dinner and my daughter ordered the fried chicken sandwich. We brought our friend who was in from Germany as well and he had some sort of beef sandwich. The fried chicken dinner was disappointing this go around. A bit dry and over cooked. My son in law ended up getting a chicken sandwich in spite of ordering the dinner. The runner had it fixed within a few minutes. Appreciated. However! The service was atrocious! Or should I say lack of service. Again, food coming out was extremely slow. Sara was our server. She rarely checked on us. Never apologized for the slow service. Never filled our drinks until we flagged her down. At one point, we bussed our own table because we were tired of having our dirty dishes on our table so I got up and put them on the table next to us. We never got her attention and most of the time couldn't find her when we needed anything. I'd highly recommend requesting at the time of seating to NOT sit in her section. This visit ran us about $135. 

Anyway, the place seems to have pretty decent food for the most part. Expect very slow service in regards to getting your food once you order. I'd highly recommend not going here if you're in a rush. We did learn they offer Happy Hour 7 days a week. Specials seem pretty good. We may try it one more time. Maybe."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the drive to the East Valley. I recommend sitting near the kitchen where you can see the dishes coming out. The service was very good. Our table tried the pretzel and cheese dip as an appetizer. The cheese sauce was amazing. For dinner we shared the Cuban pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw. The pork was perfectly cooked with lots of flavor. The coleslaw was very crunchy and very tasty. We also ordered the Thai prawn linguine which was delicious as well. We were treated to a banana berry Sunday, great way to end the meal. There's something for everyone on the menu. The portions are perfect for sharing. Looking forward to returning and trying something different. Hope they open a location in the West Valley soon."}
{"text":"First time here at happy hour. service was outstanding very informative about the menu and answered any questions. Quantity of food to price is impeccable! Great for a date night and we will be back again: GM was on the floor talking to guests making sure all were happy! 
The home made donuts with caramel sauce will garuntee a return from you"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to go. I went just recently for the first time after the little hype that I've heard.

First impression - the inside decor was badass. From the beer selection decor to the sweet modern couches. The look overall is great. 

Its right by the mall, which is a great location. I think this place will do well because of that alone. 

I ordered a burger. My friends ordered Chicken Marsala and Fish Tacos. Everyone seems to think their food was Ok. I don't think it was FANTASTIC, but I may have just ordered the wrong them for my liking. 

Customer service was great. Everyone seemed genuinely nice and happy to be there. There is a pretty sweet bar area, which I thought looked cool as well. 


I hear that the desert here is awesome. For that reason alone, I'll probably be back to try this place again. I may even order something different and try and get this place up to 4 or 5 stars! 

Customer service 5/5
Restaurant cleanliness 5/5
Location 4/5 (because of the traffic)
Food 3/5
Value overall 3/5"}
{"text":"Came here tonight at the recommendation of a foodie friend --- wow!  Seriously delicious. Shares the grilled salmon with my Love and it was amazing. Nice flavor and perfectly cooked. Mashed potatoes rocked. 

Highly recommended"}
{"text":"We went to Hop Social on a Friday for happy hour. We grabbed a table outside. Service was good and there were many beers to choose from. We got fish tacos, mac n cheese, and poutine. Food was good, but nothing that jumped out as \"I gotta go back and have that again!\". 

My two complaints were 1) the seating set-up outside - it felt really cramped. We had a table with one side against the outside wall (with a bench) and the other side with a chair, towards the walkway. Every time the server for the table behind us would walk by... my chair was bumped. I couldn't possibly move it in any closer to the table. And 2) the happy hour beer selection was really confusing - there was no list. The happy hour menu just says \"select craft beers\". When asked for a listing, I swear that the two different servers told us different beers (they changed shift while we were there). Would be nice to have them listed! 

But, on the plus side... the food was good. The service was good."}
{"text":"I've been here twice since it opened, and both times have been great! The entire staff is friendly and goes above and beyond to welcome you. There are plenty of seating options, and the way it's set up is very trendy and modern. There are tons of options for beer, food, and cocktails. Everyone on staff seems to like being there and want to see this new restaurant succeed. Our first visit in, the owner himself came to talk about the menu and his restaurant. I will definitely be coming back to enjoy the atmosphere and food Hop Social offers."}
{"text":"We didn't know what to expect and were very pleasantly surprised. Excellent draft beer selection. Server was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about all beers and food. Amazing steak salad. I will return specifically for this unique grilled salad. Great Cuban sandwich and fries, too. Happy to hear there may be another southeast location soon."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Great food. The fish tacos. Pretzels and the steak bites were excellent. Go for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Great food, fast service, and tasty beer. I was most impressed that the manager not only brought my husband free desert on his birthday, but a card signed by the staff. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Had the Pear Strawberry Apple Salad, on the first visit. Delicious! For sure my favorite. Next visit, I tried the Hazel Nut Chicken Crusted Salad and it was good. Will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"I have been to this establishment two times. Both times the gargonzola burger came out raw!! Took forever to get a new order finally the manager came over and I asked him if the waitress had sent him over as she told my party she was going to relate to him and the Chef to put a rush on it! He said he did not know but they had 3 Managers working!! Seems like quite a staff to pay. The rest of my party of 3 had almost finished eating!! I told him just forget my meal I wasn't going to reorder and he never apologized just said well you can walk out anytime the meal is on us!! Not the best customer service for a manager to not try and make amends besides a free meal. Loved the atmosphere so may give it another go round!!"}
{"text":"You can see in my previous review I'm not a fan of their happy hour.  I'm still not.  I stopped by for dinner with some friends and decided to get there just before happy hour ended to grab a drink before dinner.  Still, they have 40+ beers on tap, still only a handful are on happy hour, still the bartender isn't really sure which ones, and for the 2nd trip in a row, I received a different beer than what I ordered.  I can't recall this happening to me anywhere else and it's happened here twice.  2-stars for the bar.  Onward to dinner...

Needless to say with my happy hour experience I wasn't going into dinner with super high expectations.  That said, the service was excellent and attentive (she even got the drink's right!) and the food was quite good.  I went with the Cuban which was great.  It had lots of shaved ham and pulled pork and was very ample in size.  The fried chicken was also good. It's enough to feed two people if you're looking to split a dish.  It's two large chicken cutlets fried with mashed potatoes.  Additionally the donuts for dessert were a good way to end the meal.

The atmosphere on a Friday night was great and the 45 minute wait we were quoted seemed to go quickly.  For dinner, I'll be back.  For happy hour...well, we've covered that."}
{"text":"The beer list is a very attractive draw, but after coming twice they didn't have the beer my husband asked for (supposedly high in demand) either time.
First time I had the shrimp tacos, they were ok. Last night I had the meatloaf and not sure about you but I do not appreciate when stuff that is not listed on the menu shows up, like the crispy onions and green onion twirl, plus the meatloaf was spicy, like a hot sauce spicy.  Was not described that way.
My 3 1/2yo did not like the kids mac n cheese; it was too good, too gourmet, i.e, not Kraft. They brought her chicken tenders as a replacement that she liked and we appreciated that.
We don't like the tables - if you sit close to the table, your chair leg rests on the base and then you rock, so the chairs/tables aren't totally comfy.
We'll probably come back again because it's an overall good place in a good location, but we'll be more discriminatory about the entree choices and maybe ask for a booth to bypass the table base issues."}
{"text":"Phenomenal tap selection, great service, delicious food! Love the decor and over all vibe of this restaurant, nice outdoor seating area too. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Most disappointed ... I was really hoping for a great experience. My Wife and I sat on the front patio and were served by a less than excited employee. Food was very bland which I didn't finish. While finishing our drinks I noticed something over the wife's shoulder on the wall behind her seat. To not alarm her, I asked her to stand and move to the other side of the patio. She never listens to me but this time she sees I'm not messing with her and follows my instruction. There was a very large roach just a few inches away from her. When we alerted the staff of this they acted as if it was happens often. We won't be back and strongly suggest the same for you.

{"text":"Five (5) stars () for Angel who was tending bar our first night.  She provided such a great experience I knew we would be back.
We have been here twice since discovering this place and I was wishing we had come here the previous night.  
I love the ambience here.  It's a relaxed, sorta comfy gathering spot.  Even when I looked around it felt like this is a good place to gather with friends, enjoy some great beers, nosh on some tasty Happy Hour nibbles (these are enough for a meal, especially if you plan to have the donut dessert), relax and unwind.  Ya think the couches contributed to that impression?
Anyhoo...
The beers are fantastic.  The gluten restriction had to be overlooked once I gazed at the options and tasted my first sample.
I could have tasted all of the beers they were serving - you know, if time permitted.  I was just Wowed!  I suppose I was hooked.  Sours, IPAs, Porters, Stouts , Ales, K√∂lsch, many more and a few aren't on the menu.
Happy Hour is 3-6 and their reverse Happy Hour begins at 9:30.  A full HH menu along with drink specials -or special drinks, if you prefer.  
Oh, can't forget to mention they do allow *dogs on their patio.  
*Please, please, if you do bring you dog, be a responsible pet owner and POTTY your dog in advance.  If dog does have an accident, clean it up promptly and efficiently.  So gross approaching entrance and seeing AND smelling dog poo on sidewalk and in nearby garden.
Ya wonder why places don't want pets allowed? 
And word to the wise, dogs don't \"want to say hello\" so keep your pet in check and nobody gets hurt.

Once again I was drawn in by at least one review which caused me to bookmark this place.
Glad my hubby suggested we give this place a try."}
{"text":"Love the pretzels & cheese.  Excellent! 
The atmosphere is relaxed & comfortable.  The service is good & the food is pretty good.   I feel it's more of a drinks & app place, but the pretzels & cheese alone are worth the trip."}
{"text":"My wife and I attended happy hour at Hop Social Tavern and it was a very positive experience. The restuarant/bar is very comfortable inside and out and we chose to sit in the bar area. Our waitress was very friendly and very professional on how she took care of us.  My wife ordered the fish tacos and I ordered breaded chicken tenderloins off the happy hour menu. Both portions were generous, extremely tasty and priced just right. We'll definitely be back and will bring along some friends the next time"}
{"text":"Wonderful service, Avery was a great server! The food was amazing! I'm glad this place opened  perfect spot to spend a Sunday. We had the Brussels sprouts and the Social pizza, both great choices!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and the bar staff were very friendly and helpful. I ordered a margarita wo salt. It came with salt so they were very accommodating and replaced it. What I rally liked was it was totally re made. I DO NOT like a salty margarita and usually they will just dump the salted rim margarita into a glass w/o salt which surprisingly I can taste. super glad they did not do that here! We also had the strawberry pear salad , super good and the Italian pizza. The pizza is the reason for the low number of stars. I ate a piece and mind you I was starving after playing golf all day. With every bite I kept hoping it would taste better. Like really, how do you mess up a pizza?? Well on the second piece i scraped off the toppings and the dough wasn't cooked at all I could literally stretch it like raw dough.  My husband showed it to our server and he took it off our bill after offering to remake it. That said I will be back to try it again because they handled it well and it seems like a great place."}
{"text":"This place is okay. Friendly staff not bad food.  But the bar has three TVs on each side of the bar.  But they have a hanging light in front each tv. Makes it super hard to watch the games that are playing. If they moved the lights a foot and half would have been great."}
{"text":"Checked out this place with my buddy last week it was our first time there. I like the place and service was  great!  The food menu was interesting, thought I try out something new. We ordered calamari for appetizer, mushroom pizza, and the stuffed Gogonzola burger. The appetizer and pizza was delicious but didn't get a chance to taste the burger cause it came with a piece of hair in it ."}
{"text":"One of the most delicious restaurants I've been to in a long time!! Tonight we shared the stuffed salmon, BBQ ribs, and the chicken Marsala. We enjoyed the layered nachos, pretzels with beer cheese, and Ahi Tuna Poke appetizers and the donuts with caramel sauce for dessert. Everything was cooked to perfection and memorable! The open kitchen restaurant has quaint sofa seating, as well as high tops, and a spacious energy filled bar. We will definitely return often."}
{"text":"our server Erica A was great! drinks are good, food is good, my 3 y/o said the mac & cheese was YUM! definitely will come back again.

protip: try the alcohol, it's delicious!"}
{"text":"This place *could* be great. The menu and food is above average and the beer selection is decent. The problem is service and operations are just awful. Based on two separate experiences seating takes forever, beers take 10 minutes to be delivered, plates show up soaking wet, food takes 40+ minutes from pad to table. Staff is working hard but lack management structure and streamlining. 
Advice to management: You need to learn how to scale your ops if you're going to continue to run at 80% dating capacity. People keep coming because your food and atmosphere is better than most options but you've had enough time to get operations dialed in. Do better."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd try here. I really wanted it to be a favorite because the beer menu is amazing! Unfortunately, the food just falls way too short. The first time was a spicy shrimp pasta. Tasted like a lean cuisine. Last time it was the Mac & cheese. Just no flavor at all. This time it was the chicken sandwich. It was SO SALTY....we tried picking pieces out to see what was the salt item...I think it was the sauce. Maybe the chicken? Not sure, but I'm done trying. I'm really bummed! The people are super nice! Service is great! Beer menu phenomenal! All moot without good food. Color me sad."}
{"text":"This was a fabulous place with great food. The menu is eclectic and all delicious. The bar manager was fabulous, engaged with his crowd and extremely accommodating even though he was incredibly busy. All staff welcoming. 
People of all ages! 
The setting was loud, but it seems like that's the case at any sports bar! 
Definitely a \"must go\"."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the deconstructed steak salad is unique and delicious. Service was really good considering they just opened a little while ago. My husband loved his dish and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I happily spent all 1200 of my calories at Hop Social today and don't regret a single one. Everything was delicious! I'll get back to that in a minute. First I have to talk about the customer service, it was fantastic. So Tenley was our server she was so friendly and attentive, our drinks and food came to our table so fast.  Our dinner entrees came out before our appetizer,  Tenley profusely apologized, the manager brought out our appetizer and apologized, it was comped by the manager, the tiny booboo was handled so professionally I didn't feel slighted in the least. Actually it worked out to my benefit, I took my pretzel dipped it in beer cheese then dipped it in my Chicken Pot Pie, dipped in beer cheese dipped in meatloaf, dipped in beer cheese dipped in mash potatoes, dipped in beer cheese dipped in Mojito, just kidding but I did a lot of double dipping. YUMMMM 

Beer selection was huge I took sips of several but ended up with some traditional but equally well made tasty mojitos. 

I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie which came out so hot, and tasted great just like moms. The meatloaf and mash potatoes were delicious and also tasted great just like moms. OH! And last but not least DONUT BALLS with Carmel Sauce! Crunchy crispy sweet cinnamony little nummies, not like moms she didn't let us eat donuts."}
{"text":"The pros:
Cool atmosphere, decent food, and good happy hour. 

The cons:
Unfortunately the bartenders at this restaurant are more distracted that a kid with ADD in the outfield of a tee ball game. In the unlikely event I ever come back here, I am going to order my drinks and then go catch a flick at Harkins.  If I stay through all the credits, they should just about be ready by the time I get back provided I walk. 

The highlight of our most recent and likely final visit was after waiting 30 mins for a drink, my girlfriend ordered a house Merlot. When another patron asked the bartender what kind of wine it was he drew from his knowledge as a high level sommelier and replied \"The Sh*tty Kind, haha.\"  

This place could be great, but only after Jon Taffer comes in to smash a couple liquor bottles and berate the bartending staff to pay more attention to paying customers than their Instagram feed."}
{"text":"Busy and seemingly popular place on a Friday night.  The Bison Burger was good, and they have a large selection of beers on tap (over 50), which is great.  I sat at the bar, and the service was ok considering how busy they were.  TV setup at the bar was good, and they had a variety of games on. I don't live in the area, but I had this place bookmarked so I decided to take a drive and check it out.  I'm glad I did.  I would and probably will return."}
{"text":"Hop social has had enough time now to work out kinks in a new restaurant but for the amount of chances we have given them, they fall short in my book, I'm not hard to please when it comes to food and alcohol. 
Service at the bar is way too nonchalant. \"Hey what's up, whatcha drinking?\" Is not how I want to start a dining experience. I'm not expecting City Hall type service but at least introduce yourself. I have a hard time speaking up for myself but I'm pretty sure my drink was really wrong. I ordered the Phoenix rising which was vodka and spicy passion fruit but when the bartender brought it to me it was almost like a double shot. No ice, no presentation, no kidding. The fire seared Ahi was incredible though! I do have to give props for the flavor and creativity with the dish, it was very yummy!"}
{"text":"I'd driven by here a few times and it always looked busy so I figured I would have my birthday dinner here with friends. At first, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect (I remember when it used to be the Elephant Bar) but I was pleasantly surprised. 

The entire place has been remodeled and it has a cool \"modern\" vibe. There is also a nice outside area if you want to sit outside. The staff was super friendly and very accommodating.

As for the food, it was pretty good! Not to sound cheap, but it seemed to be a tad bit expensive but the food was good. I had the steak with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Definitely something that I would recommend! They also had a nice selection of alcohol.

Lastly, when they found out that it was my birthday, they gave me a banana split and a nice card signed by the entire staff (and thankfully they didn't sing).

Definitely a place I would go back to!"}
{"text":"Most of the reviews for this place are people loving it.  We didn't quite have the same feeling.  We loved the Elephant Bar when it was in this location and wanted to give the new restaurant a try.  The interior has been converted  to a very open concept.  It's nice.  There are lots of high bar seats, some lower tables and booths.  There's a very modern feel.

I wasn't real pleased with the menu.  I'm not sure what we were looking for but had a little trouble ordering for a late lunch because I didn't feel we had good options.  We didn't want a hamburger and didn't want a steak.  We ended up with a pepperoni pizza.

The 12\", 6 slice pizza was $14.99 and had a total of 7 pieces of pepperoni.  The pizza was very good and had lots of cheese.  Seasoning was good but it was more like a cheese pizza than a pepperoni one.

We felt the restaurant was quite expensive for what it offered.  Service was good."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and there were a number of positive aspects that helped them earn four stars. First off, we were greeted with a warm welcome at the door when we arrived and our table of five was immediately seated. The dining area is quite spacious with interesting couch-like seating in one area and counter-height booths in another. We tried the donut appetizer and OMG...so good! Don't be scared away by the reference to ricotta cheese, which sounds like an odd ingredient addition to a donut. They really are wonderful and frankly were probably the best part of the meal! The food was good but it I'd say it wasn't anything special (the donuts were special). The pastrami on the pretzel roll could have been but it needed some seasoning/some flavor. My hubby said the same about the meatloaf - just needed some seasoning. Our waitress was quite friendly, attentive, and efficient. All in all a good experience. We'd certainly give them another try."}
{"text":"This is a great place.  The food is fantastic and the service is awesome.  The 3 times I've been there, the music absolutely consumes the patio making it hard to visit and really takes away from any ambiance that we love in similar patio restaurants. I also noticed the crowd is a little more mature, like me, and would likely appreciate music that is all age friendly.   Each time we've visited we have asked that the music is turned down it is so obnoxiously loud.  We are happy to have this as an option and will go back   Hoping they take the music request to heart."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a chill night i'd recommend this place. Looks pretty fancy on the inside."}
{"text":"Very busy for a Tuesday and a much older lively crowd. The pretzel appetizer is delicious. Good selection of beers (some local) server wasn't well educated on the revolving choices. Disappointing considering it is a beer place. Grilled steak salad with Brussels sprouts was good, pizza was not. The Italian sausage pizza was loaded with green and black olives making it very salty and there was nothing special about the crust. Glad to see the crowd. Great prices for happy hour but you must sit in the bar.

Second trip and loved the veggie burger. So unique with black beans, beets and saut√©ed poblano! Lots of flavor and the texture was good, and because of the beets it was a beautiful red. Also the buttermilk fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy was fantastic, crispy juicy and tender. The donuts might be my favorite item on the menu, perfect amount of cinnamon and powdered sugar but the caramel sauce was perfection!! Do not resist the urge to indulge, it was worth every calorie bite!"}
{"text":"Came here for Father's Day 2018 with my dad and boyfriend. We got sat down right away. Our server brought most of our things to us in a timely manner but There are two reason why they didn't get 5 stars and that's because a few little things that matter while in a restaurant. He forgot our waters and didn't bring them out til we almost left, and we asked for ranch for our fries and they brought out some sort of horse radish sauce which tasted NOTHING like ranch but really besides all that, this place was great. The beer selection, the food and the people were pretty great."}
{"text":"Fisrt time here - came later 8:45 - for dinner hoping there wasn't a wait. Seated right away - friendly service - good food & drink - cool vibe -  we\"ll be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and presentation for a sports bar.  They remodeled the former elephant bar and opened it up to make it very light and open.  The food was delicious the noise level was high but because of the nature of the place, expected."}
{"text":"Great food had the appetizer chicken strips and was soo good! And big portion! We had a large party that accommodated us. Great service and atmosphere"}
{"text":"Met some friends here for dinner on Monday. Fantastic food! Loved the unique choices on the menu. Our server was very attentive and charming. We enjoyed the fact that they specialize in Oregon beers since we're from Central Oregon. Great atmosphere!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We have been here for happy hour many times and always had a good experience. We went last night at 5:00 and the bar was packed so sat at a table just on the other side of the wall from the bar. Ordered the house wine thinking would be getting HH prices since HH lasts until 6.
We were very disappointed to hear they only do HH pricing in the bar. Most restaurants in the area - especially since Hop Social has the open concept - offers HH pricing no matter where you sit. The bar is very small and with the summer coming, the outside patio will not be doable, so
unless you are one of the lucky few who actually gets a table in the bar, will have to pay full price during HH. There are many other options in the area - Tres Tempe, TPM, Good Times Charli's - that do offer HH to all patrons so unless Hop Social changes their  policies, will not be going there again."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time and it met all expectations.  Our waitress was amazing, the food was to die for.  We had too many delicious options to choose from which will keep us coming back.  Celebrated a birthday here which included an awesome Sunday and personalized birthday card.  Such awesome environment and personalities here.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It was okay. There was 6 of us for a meal and everyone ended up getting their meals at different times. It wasn't a HUGE deal, but I feel very uncomfortable eating my meal if everyone doesn't have their food. So I waited and mine got cold before theirs came. The food was pretty good. My friend had the pot pie that was supposed to be awesome. She said it was ok. Many people we know love the place, so we will definitely give it another try."}
{"text":"This place has great food, really cool staff and a great place to dine and socialize.  Definitely check this place out. You'll be glad ya did."}
{"text":"So this is our 4th time here and once again they nailed it.  The service is spot on, management comes around to check on us to see if we are doing ok.   The decor is fresh, relaxing and  has some funky cool lighting fixtures.  The food is yummy and have never been disappointed,  personal recommendation is the meat loaf, it's better then mom's. The beer selection has several varieties and they have chosen some really good brews."}
{"text":"What a great lunch! Got seated right away, server was friendly efficient and made sure we had a great time. Cesar steak salad was incredible! Will be coming back for me!"}
{"text":"On a work trip and been here two nights in a row now. I'll start with the service, second to none! Angel at the bar is awesome and will watch over everything to make sure it's perfect and if you're lucky she'll remember your name :) Food is great and the atmosphere is perfect. I would recommend!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came to Hop for Valentine's Day due to Firebirds 3 hour wait. The first thing that scored points with us was zero wait time. 

Our server was quite pleasant and attentive. He made sure we were comfortable and satisfied. One point of improvement I would suggest is to make sure he knows that you do have hot drinks as well. Nothing on the mnThe manager came around multiple times as well.

One thing I should have counted on with a venue like this was how noisy it was. But the noise level was such that it could have made it impossible for the waiter or cook to hear medium well as opposed to medium rare for my steak. 

Speaking of my steak. Sorry Firebirds! This ribeye dwarfed yours.  This was nearly a plate-sized ribeye. It was definitely quite tasty and gives Firebirds a run for their money.

For an appetizer, we had the corn fritters which we tore up faster than a school of piranha on a carcass. They had the right combination of texture and flavor. The honey sauce was excellent. It is sourced locally but has the same taste and texture as Manuka honey.

Overall, the experience was pleasant and we will return.

My wife had the chicken tender salad and was quite happy. The tenders looked quite good and the portions were large enough for her to eat the next day."}
{"text":"First time here and the service is absolutely amazing and beautiful the food is exactly the owner came and greeted us made sure we were well taken care of!!!!!  The Coziness of the restaurant is fantastic!!!  We will be returning"}
{"text":"This place is really big and have variety of beer and food.. it has a little bit of everything.. in the beginning our server was very attentive, kept checking up on us and etc.. but once it got busier it took her longer to come back.. which I understand it was getting busy.. but kinda wished it was lil more consistent I guess.. the food over all was good other the kung pow chicken.. very very Americanized.. ever thing else was good"}
{"text":"This place was great! I'm not sure I've had Margherita pizza as good as the one I found here, and that says a lot. The sauce had a sweet hint to it and the crust was perfection. Everyone in our group was excited about their meal, and the diversity of options is bound to offer something for everyone. 

You may notice upon first review of the menu that they offer donuts as as appetizer. Do it. Get the donuts. 

Great beer and other alcohol selections and the vibe and staff are also upbeat and fun. I just wondered what it would take to get a set of couches like they have in there... so cool!"}
{"text":"Had the Stuffed Gorgonzola Burger... comes with arugula, smoked bacon, a Ginormous sliced onion (pass) and creamy horseradish sauce. Burger and fries were good, but I enjoyed the I overall atmosphere that came with the dinner.

Definitely a spot to come back and visits as they have some 50+ beers on tap and a nice \"social\" vibe for Chandler (that's been needed). 

A lot of items on the menu to give a try as I spent most of my time talking to the people near me at the bar regarding what they had in front of them. 

If your a \"frequent resident\" of the Chandler Mall area then u know this is the old Elephant bar location. Watching it go through construction and expansion was interesting as it seemed like it took a while. But in the end, the results have paid off.

Overall impression of this place is it's ideal for a meetup with friends, coworkers, or just dinner if ur looking for an upbeat vibe. Drinks came correct so I was happy!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.. 
Medium pricey and it's a very good place for a classy and friendly dinner or happy hour."}
{"text":"Great diverse menu. Something for everyone. I've had 4-5 dishes over the past 6 weeks and they were good. Serving sizes good, as well. We like the environment and the patio is nice. Serving staff is hit or miss. We didn't have any drinks from the bar so I cannot comment on those. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Amazing soul styled, home cooking, scratch food.
Great beers on tap.
Chicken pot pie and meatloaf are amazing!
Chicken sandwich was ok.
Wasn't a fan of the donuts."}
{"text":"What a beautiful place. The service is awesome.the bartender was super attention give and sweet. Lots of beers to choose from and a big menu. My friend and I just had a few appetizers that were delicious. I can't wait to come back and try it for happy hour!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in saturday evening ( feb 10 ) for dinner. Busy place..  we made reservations and we were seated within 5 minutes.
Recommend Saturday evenings to make reservations otherwise 45 min wait..
Waitress Erika was very friendly and professional. Made our visit delightful. Atmosphere was very unique. Booths, high tops, low tops, couchs and chairs, bar seating , regular dining tables, outside patio seating. Decor was excellent. Open kitchen to dining area is immaculate. 
We had a grilled chicken sandwich and a meatloaf dinner. The bill was a reasobable $30. Chicken was tender and bun roll it came on was delicious. The meatloaf was exceptional with garlic mashed potatoes and cooked carrots topped with onion strings. All very tasty.
We were impressed with the complete experience. A definite return in the future..  thumbs up !!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here twice for happy hour with my coworkers. You can only get the happy hour deals if you're sitting in the bar area or outside on the patio. Service is extremely slow. The first time I came here, our server took orders one at a time. She literally came up to our table, took one of our orders and walked away. Didn't even ask if anyone else needed anything or checked in on us very often. You know when you try to get someones attention before they walk away, but they completely fail to acknowledge you? Yea, that was us every single time she stopped at our table haha. 

They have 52 beers on tap, a lot of local brews. Which is pretty neat. You get $1 off draft pints during HH. The steak bites were pretty good. & the spicy mac & cheese was very good as well. Does have a huge kick to it for those who like spicy food. If you cant 
Handle too much spice, I wouldn't recommend ordering this dish. Donuts are awesome as well. They taste very similar to churro but more doughy haha. It comes with caramel on the side but they are still just as good if you eat them by itself. & who could forget about the prices during HH, they are awesome. Just wished the service was just as good as the food and drinks."}
{"text":"A very mediocre spot in my opinion.    Atmosphere is great, love the open kitchen, but everything else could be better.    Hostess right from the start had a b*tchy attitude towards my wife.    I ordered the Citrazona which was luke warm, and my wife a vodka soda with a splash of pineapple which tasted more like a double shot.    For dinner we ordered the pizza and salad; pizza was a 4 out of 10, the salad we ended up cancelling because it didn't arrive until our pizza was finished.

I'll give this place one more try but this time going in w/ low to no expectations."}
{"text":"We LOVE Hop Social. My parents live nearby so we always go when I'm on that side of town. The chicken pot pie is AMAZING! It is a very nice, modern restaurant with TVs at the bar and an open kitchen. 

They have some pretty large tables. We have easily gone with a big group a few times and were seated right away. Their beer selections are great with 52 beers on tap and a few rotating seasonal beers. 

We have been impressed with all the food we have tried from the pretzels & cheese and nachos to the spicy tuna roll, stuffed salmon and Kung Pao chicken. Seriously I think we have tried it all  Get the house made donuts, you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks but do not go there if you have a large party.  

They have this extremely stupid system where they don't submit the whole tables orders at the same time.  

We had 16 and there was a 45 minute span when our food arrived.   

The table next to us with 8 had a 20 minute span. 

We will probably return with only 2-4 people."}
{"text":"45 minutes wait at the door, however when you go on their website and make an immediate reservation through open table, the table becomes available. Strange process. Tables don't get bussed in a timely manner, so customers have to wait longer to get seated. Food is mediocre at best. Fries were cold soggy and over cooked, the salad was stale, the pizza crust was not at all what a good pizza crust should be. Same beer at other restaurants nearby are 30% less in price. First time here and very disappointed."}
{"text":"Monday night and they are 3/4 capacity.  Sat at the bar and got served quickly.   Really nice wine selection for a hop tavern.  
Selected a William Hill cab.  I know that winery well...see pic from the day after the Atlas Peak! 
Selected the Cab Tips.  
WELL, that was great!  Tender chunks of fillet in a wine sauce with creamy mashed and asparagus.  Come on, it's only Monday!  I'm in town all week and I will be back for an other selection.  Can't try them all this trip...but hey, there's no rush.  Come here!!!"}
{"text":"I really had high hopes for this place but they failed at every turn. Whether it be food, drinks or most importantly service. Sadly of all things you would think a place like this would want you to drink and have a good time but apparently they enforce 4 drink maximum regardless of how long you have been there. Well at least this rules applies to folks who are of any ethnic background, (the folks next to us were on their 3rd drink that hour and had been there since 6 pm, it was 9 pm when I asked them).I wouldn't go as far as to say this place discriminates because they did hire a 4 ft 2 inch ginger only a mother can love as a manager. But I will say stay clear of this place if you plan on having a good night or want a decent meal.
It is very out of character for me to leave a bad review or complain at the end of the day it's a business and it feeds many mouths. But this place is true disappointment."}
{"text":"We've given this place 3 tries, because we really wanted to like it, especially because of the beer selection. All 3 visits had horrible service. My honest opinion is it's not the servers, it's management. Based on our observations, it seems to be poorly run. Which is sad, because the atmosphere is great. The food is just ok. My husband really liked the fried chicken. Other things we have tried:
-calamari, menu says it's hand cut, it doesn't taste fresh at all, and is overbreaded
-hamburger, tasted like a skinny frozen patty
-asparagus, all 3 times over cooked 
-coleslaw, really good
-fish and chips, fish was good but overbreaded and really greasy so couldn't finish it
-chicken fingers, good
After 3 tries, we won't be back :(  BUT- if you're looking for place to just go sit at the bar and have a good beer, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food and awesome beer! There is something on this menu for everyone and as a transplant from Oregon I really enjoyed that they offered great Oregon craft beers as well as some great local craft beers. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this new place.  Great beer selection and menu.  The food was very good and loved all of the local and specialty draft beers.  We did have a couple of issues though.  First off, we were sat at a two person table that should not of been a table.  It was literally on top of the table next to us.  We were a part of their dinner.  I asked to be moved to another table and was denied.  I've never had a restaurant saw no when we asked to move.  They should not try to squeeze in this table, on top of another and in a very high traffic area.  The second issue was the length of time it took for dinner.  We we're there 30 minutes before our appetizer came and over an hour by the time dinner showed up.  All of the food we had was great, but service and the slowness of the food was unbearably slow.  We may try it again, we did enjoy it, but hopefully the figure out these delays soon."}
{"text":"Tried this place yesterday with a coworker and I have to say I am impressed, not so much with the blah gray paint on the outside but the inside makes up for it.  The service provided by Adam was excellent and the servings were huge, which would account for the prices.  I had the cheeseburger and my friend had the fried chicken plate.  The cheeseburger was so huge I had to take half of it home but my friend devoured the whole plate.  Both meals were above average and definitely deserves a return trip."}
{"text":"My favorite newer place in Chandler.  Great beer selection and cocktails. Friendly staff, Cari is our favorite server, and excellent atmosphere.  Great food comes with a great diverse menu and pricing is in line with BJ's or Cheesecake Factory in the area."}
{"text":"Great experience today. I haven't posted a restaurant review in a while but I had to this time. From the being greeted, seated, served and visited by the manager, I really felt like it was their mission that we enjoyed our dinner tonight. Every dish excelled. I went simple with the fish and chips. True beer battered and reminded me of something I had in Australia. Wife had the steak salad, very nice. Little guys mac n cheese was enticing me to steal a bite. This place is highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this place after reading the reviews.  It was just A-ok.  
Maybe I ordered the wrong entree but it was one of their specialities.  I decided to go with the fish tacos and I was underwhelmed. Had a reservation and we were sat on high top table near the kitchen.  I expected since we had reservation we should end up with a booth.   I did read other reviews that the pizza is good and other entrees.  I might give them one more try maybe when they are not soooo crowded."}
{"text":"Amazing food, awesome service and atmosphere. Happy hour is a great price for the quality and quantity of food. The wife and I also split the French dip sandwich for dinner, it was awesome served as two meals just the sandwich was split. 

Angel at the bar is extremely nice along with everyone else."}
{"text":"I thought this place was good and had a great atmosphere the first time i went however the second time was a totally opposite experience. I went with a friend on Father's Day and was told the wait would be 25 min waited about 10 min and was seated, so i thought i was in for a good time. So our waitress comes over and asks what we would like to drink we got water initially because we were still looking at the drink menu. I kid you not the waitress, Ariel, was serving a table right behind us with 8 people, and she didn't take our drink orders for another 20 min. Once i finally got her attention she asked what we wanted. My friend ordered a 16 oz beer and i sprang for the larger size while advising the waitress I'm not sure when I'll see you again so I'll take the larger size. The waitress immediately got defensive rolled her eyes and said i said sorry like 20 thousand times. So i proceeded to ask for a manager. The manager comes over and offers us a comped appetizer. We refused the food and finished our beers hesitantly hoping our drinks were not tampered with. It's safe to say i will never be back again!!"}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was really bad from star to finish. Before being seated for dinner we sat at the bar waiting for the rest of our party to arrive.  Five minutes later the bartender still hadn't served us so we went without a drink and they were not even busy.  Once we sat for dinner the servers were also not well educated on menu items and the food took forever to arrive."}
{"text":"Really good food, atmosphere, and service been there 4 times already and still keep going back!"}
{"text":"Much nicer than expected!  We tried the  happy hour scene and we loved It!
Place is huge and gets busier as time goes on around sunset. We had a nice selection to choose from (food and drinks).  I had the taco fish happy hour for $5.95. My husband had the Chicken and fries, our friend had the steak with salad.
Taco was super good and portions were huge. Flavor wise it was spot on.  My husband picked chicken and Gallo, and praised it.  Our friend like the steak slices but would have preferred the Chicken when he saw it on our table. All appetizers were priced around $5 or less.
My taco fish  (2) were big and soooo good!  When compared with Sand Bar, from this point on, l'd rather go to Hop Social anytime!  Food and beverages tasted better, prices were a lot lower for what we got. Also even though it got really busy, we could still have a conversation, they don't overload you with sounds. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Hi;

Food was decent; not blow me out of the water. Thought the experience of booking on \"yelp\": then being told because we booked only a half hour prior we wouldn't be seated: (felt the entitlement of our head hostess can cool off) started the experience. Observing the wait staff buss their own tables (hop social culture); made the poor waiter; not be able to connect; have timely deliveries; and further socialize.  Weird experience to a local bar dressed up."}
{"text":"The servers here are so friendly and helpful! Ericka is amazing!! She was attentive and made great conversation and recommendations. Ericka made it a point to remember what 5 beers I wanted to try for the flight and she got it right without writing it down!! The food is fantastic!! I absolutely love that everything is made from scratch. Even though it was busy tonight, everyone made an extra effort to bring us free chocolate covered strawberries and donuts! The beer here is so awesome! There are so many selections; much more than other local taverns in the area. I loved the flight of 5 so I could try 5 different beers and the prices are very reasonable. Overall, I would highly recommend this place and will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"I have mixed reviews about this place. The first time we visited we had such horrible service.I actually cannot recall the last time I had experienced such terrible service. We were seated at our table around 6pm and it took our server about 20 minutes just to bring us water after we had asked. Once our food was delivered I asked if we could get some ketchup for our fries and she returned 15 minutes later with a tiny amount of sauce. Literally about 2 tbsp of ketchup for two people to share. As I was eating my fries she literally took my plate away while I was chewing my food and didn't even ask if I was finished. Same with our drinks. She grabbed my husbands beer when he had about 1/4 of his beer left. We let her know that he was not finished and she looked annoyed and stormed away.  

A month later we decided to try again. Only because the food was so good. Certainly we couldn't have horrible service two visits in a row, right? WRONG! The food was delicious however I don't don't think we will return. Literally just horrible service ever. Such a shame because they really do have a fantastic menu"}
{"text":"Great stuff. Tried a flight and enjoyed each beer. Price might seem a bit high but then again I would have to try this another time or two and see how the portions are. We sampled appetizers and enjoyed the nachos and thought the Ahi Tuna was ok."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great beer. Food took forever (35-40 min on a Sunday afternoon around 1:30) and is overpriced- my $13 strawberry pear chicken salad had very little chicken and should have been $10 at most. Hubby's BBQ burger was okay but not really anything special. Great place for appetizers and drinks or just drinks. Pastas / other specialties sounded good but I see those more as dinner options (especially at those prices), can't imagine the wait time to get your food during dinner rush."}
{"text":"Our server was very unfriendly and got our order wrong. When the order finally came 15 minutes later it was under cooked. Disappointing. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Good Craft beer selection and a killer happy hour. Cheap and inventive. Wait staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is very chill and has a great happy hour with a strong menu and solid drinks. I like the price of the beer flights and love the donut balls they have on the menu.."}
{"text":"So, my wife and I had been anxiously awaiting the grand opening of this new place for a while. Was excited for a new Hop Heavy beer place...This is a very hard review to give because the staff was friendly, the food was ok, and yet I find myself debating between 2 or 3 stars. The bottom line is that it feels NO different than a corporate franchise like Red Robin or Applebee's once you are inside at the bar. The beer choices were limited in the sense that you've already had everything they have to offer (only for half the price at any other bar). They have like 5 beers on Happy Hour, and those are still $5 even on HH?! The others are $7 and more. The happy hour food was ok, but nothing special. They spent months and tons of money transforming this place from the old Elephant Bar only to make it just as corporate and Blahh as every other mall bar you've been to. Please either be super unique or super cheap, you just can't have it both ways. Won't be back."}
{"text":"A last minute decision for NYE dinner.....GREAT FIND.   They have only been here 5 weeks. The pot pie was awesome....bacon-wrapped meatloaf....yup awesome! Our friends had the ribs and tenderloin tips....everyone was happy.  We also had a couple apps.  This place has a great atmosphere; decor is modern. Can't wait to come back!!"}
