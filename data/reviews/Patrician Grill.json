{"text":"This is a very laid back, traditional greasy spoon diner. It seems a bit like time has stopped. This diner definitely has some edge compared with the posh furniture shops nearby.   The food and service are straightforward. A cheese burger tastes just like a cheese burger should. Actually the customers seemed very non-fancy too. Keeping it simple, great!"}
{"text":"This is a greasy spoon folks, everyone knows what that means. The breakfast is cheap and good. There is one guy trying to serve everyone coffee and breakfast so relax. I'm giving this 4 stars for being one of the last true diners in the city.   **don't expect anything but booths and simple food. If you go here expecting more, I don't want to hear your complaints. :D **"}
{"text":"Always come here for breakfast with family. Service is great, food is great, some good regular coffee and got a home-y feel. If your looking for a decent home style breakfast nothing fancy this is the place. Usually the server is by himself, so relax take it easy on him. This is a place to enjoy your breakfast while reading the newspaper."}
{"text":"I go here on Saturday mornings before heading over to St Lawrence Market. Old school dinner that is aware of its nostalgia. The fluffiest pancakes I've had in a long time...a must try. The milkshakes are pretty badass too! I recommend you go here for a good well-priced no-frills breakfast."}
{"text":"Sitting in a booth at the Patrician Grill is kind of like being on a roller coaster. Somewhat cramped, a little uncomfortable and you're never sure exactly what's coming down the line.   I've eaten here dozens of times over the years, and have had some really good experiences and some not so great ones. The menu is expected - regular greasy spoon/diner fare, with no real extra surprises. The one thing that never fails to amaze me is that the fries taste so so so eerily like McDonald's. My go-to grilled cheese is definitely decent here and everything else I've tried has also been diner tasty.   The service is friendly and wait times vary depending on how busy they are. The one thing I really hate about this place (like many other diners) is that you leave the place reeking of grease. There is nothing I hate more than walking around for the rest of the day with my hair smelling like I just took a bath in bacon and eggs.   The atmosphere is fun and makes you wish you were walking out into Toronto 50 years ago - but only if you weren't so gosh darn stinky."}
{"text":"Love this place. I come here quite regularly, it's a place where they know what I want instantly. Cheap prices and good food. It's not a complicated place. Is a place where I come and read the paper and get exactly what I want and expect. Stress free place. No credit or debit but ATM downstairs."}
{"text":"Very good burger!  Cool diner.  It was busy so that is a good thing.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is ok. It's cheap diner food that isn't all that bad. The service is horrible. I don't know who he is. But he is always there. Hes either the manager, owner, or what ever. He is the rudest person. Hes sarcastic, impatient, and just a douche bag. I would never go back."}
{"text":"May as well try to get there for the early bird breakfast special, open the place up. Special Old Reserve. \"What can I getcha?\""}
{"text":"One of the things I love most about my job is it's across the street from the Patrician. Classic Toronto diner. If you do diner you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"We found this breakfast restaurant on Yelp! And wasn't disappointed. It was exactly as described: quick, affordable, and greasy!  We chose this diner as it was close to our hotel and was inexpensive. we both ate for under $25 tip included.  Highly recommend if in the area and want a hearty breakfast for a fair price!"}
{"text":"Great little Italian diner perfect for an easy breakfast or a delicious burger. We got the burger (yes it's homemade) and the breakfast special. Cheap and delicious. Efficient service. Great posters on the wall :) sit at the counter and get the real diner experience. Don't miss out on the coleslaw either!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I don't have much to say about this place...this is a open kitchen operation, and most of the customers here are from the neighborhood. I came here for brunch...everything is just mediocre...my tables and water glass are not shining. My fish and chips is just not worth of my hard-work money."}
{"text":"I'm writing this update WITHOUT reading my previous review. The Patrician was the first stop in what has ended up being a 2 1/2 year long, weekly breakfast get together with friends. We've been to almost 120 different places, all of which qualify as greasy spoons, or they at least offer a greasy spoon style breakfast. Authentic greasy spoons or diners are our priority, but we are running out of those. This update springs from a new perspective...that of someone who has a bit of experience in this department...and over 100 other places to compare it to.  The Patrician is an authentic greasy spoon. Built in the 50's and run by the same family since 1967, this place is great. It's got a lunch counter with an open grill, and a number of booths. Coffee was offered before we were even seated, and the server/owner was very friendly and efficient. The eggs were done perfectly (over easy, and sunny side up) and I'm told by my comrades that the bacon was \"above average\". Average bacon, but cooked perfectly. Crisp, but not dried out...and very flat. The toast was standard, Wonder-style brown bread, home fries pretty good, and the coffee was about average.  It's the authentic vibe that makes this place. If you are trying to find traditional Toronto greasy spoons, add this one to your list."}
{"text":"Discovered this place when I had an hour to kill. It is amazing to see a place like this still going strong in this neighbourhood. As far as greasy spoons go this place is tops in my book. It is pretty much what you hope for when you walk through the door. Coming back here soon and often"}
{"text":"I'd like to go with it higher but I can't... The price is great for the breakfast (it's all I've had their) I mean for being on King St I appreciate theyve maintained the greasy spoon price... But don't expect quality service, same guy (assuming owner) but he gets the job done so I won't complain... I will however negativity comment on the cleanliness and fruit flies... I stopped going for that reason."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like a good diner?  this place is old school, good food, friendly people."}
{"text":"If you're wandering around king east on a cloudy Saturday morning after an especially rough night with your friend Vodka then this diner is for you.  The staff is pleasant, the diner is greasy and the food hits the spot. In terms of breakfast selection it's pretty bare bones from your egg/bacon/toast options, omelettes, or breakfast sandwiches. The sales tax is included in the menu price. A breakfast for 2 with coffee came to 23$ inclusive of tax. They only take cash here so hope you didn't spend it all the night before."}
{"text":"Totally a dive, and totally awesome!  We stumbled in here just before it closed on Saturday at 2pm. The place is an old-school diner with a menu that has all the basics you'd expect in such a place. I had the grilled chicken on greek salad ($11), and it was super yummy and surprisingly filling. Good portions. My friend had an omellete platter, and his food was equally cheap and tasty.   2 meals with 2 drinks came to $22, plus tip. Great value!!"}
{"text":"This place is kind of an establishment on King East.  A place that ppl will fight tooth and nail for if they are ever threatened to go out of business.   It also has really mediocre food.  But it's that kind of old school, surly customer service that you kind of love/hate from a diner that has been there since forever.  Fairly affordable, but definitely not the most affordable in the area Alright, definitely not the worst or best in the area. A place you kind of both love- b/c of the old diner experience and hate- because of the old diner experience.  Worth going either once or being a regular at- if you get what I'm saying.  I'll stick with once."}
{"text":"Not a bad breakfast just nothing special, the eggs are what you would expect from anywhere else the bacon is nice and crispy the sausage was a little to soft for me I like it to be a more well done. All in all I had the the 3 eggs breakfast special with coffee for roughly $9-10 The meal felt a little smaller compared to other places."}
{"text":"Good inexpensive breakfast, comfy booths. On King Street on the way to work. Parking on King permitted after 9a.  Great service!"}
{"text":"My first review was a bit amateurish, so I feel like i need to revive and revamp this  review so here we go, second review (don't remember how many times I been here 4?)   I had the breakfast special once again 3 eggs, toast, home fries and coffee all 8.75 including tax. That was probably the best thing about this.   Eggs: I had them over easy, thou too much of fried egg and not enough run with yolk, they were decent after I add salt and pepper. They werent bad but they werent the best eggs I had so 3/5 there  Home Fries As people have read in my past reviews of breakfast places, the home fries are what usually the issue, either they are really good like I have had at The Bus Terminal  or bad like I have had at Egg Smart.  Here I would put it on better end of the scale they were good, decent and i didn't hate them 3/5  Sausage This is what is probably the most disappointing, i felt like I was eating a breakfast sausage drom the frozen section of the supermarket. Atleast it tasted good but it wasnt anything special 2/5  And there was coffee and toast. No issue there.  So that why I would give this place a 3 plus .5 for price so  3.5/5"}
{"text":"This is a late review, but well worth it.  I love the small, diner, greasy spoon type of establishments, especially when it comes to breakfast.   I did Yelp and Google search for the aforementioned type of place while visiting Toronto back in December 2016. The Patrician Grill, in my opinion, stood out from the rest. So I decided to pay this place a visit one morning. My decision was made easy because this diner was within walking of the condo in which I was staying for my visit. I made the walk and was not disappointed when I walked into the Patrician.  The restaurant was packed, but there were a couple of tables available. I chose one and sat down. Even though the place was nearly full of customers, the waitress came over to me not even a minute after I sat down. I love places that when full, the staff treat you as if you are the only person there. Basically their staff managed the many customers well. PERFECT.  I ordered french toast, scrambled eggs and bacon. Of course, they did not disappoint one bit. My food was cooked to my specifications and I did not need to tell them to cook anything additionally. Their french toast definitely was nothing short of outstanding.   Anyone who lives in Toronto, or visits there, should definitely consider the Patrician for your breakfast needs. You will love it greatly, just as I did."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall greasy spoon - not a bad thing. But I found the prices a bit on the high side for such an establishment.  I'd probably only come here for breakfast - they have the greasy spoon standard of eggs, bacon, home fries (skimpy portion) and toast. The service was ok."}
{"text":"It's a great greasy spoon to check out if you're in the neighbourhood. They don't have the widest variety of hours so it was a while before I had the chance to finally try them out. I went there later in the afternoon on Saturday so it wasn't particularly busy and my friend and I got seats right away. The breakfast burger and home fries were delicious. We actually ended up being the last ones there, as mentioned they're not open for long hours and it appeared that there was a film crew coming in to set up. We were not rushed though and the staff was very friendly with letting us take our time to finish our meal."}
{"text":"I love supporting local businesses and the Patrician Grill fits that bill. Breakfast anytime, great burgers and good, hearty food all around. I've been going a few years and the owners are great. Always a warm welcome. It's cash only so be prepared!"}
{"text":"Tried it for breakfast today, can't say I was at all impressed. The server was kind of pushy and had pretty sarcastic answers, and not in a charming way. They don't refill soda, even though they have it on fountain. Weird. I asked for a glass of water, which she never brought. Eventually had to get up and take a glass and water pitcher back to our table. They forgot to give my companion his toast, it sat on the counter until we had basically finished our meal. I love diners, but I could do without going back here."}
{"text":"Not a whole ton of variety but the food is quite good. For about $2, you get a big plate of onion rings! Staff are really nice and friendly. There are lots of old Hollywood posters on the walls, giving the diner a vintage, all-American vibe. Sucks that it's cash only but it adds to the diner's old-school charm."}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant at 11:07 on a thursday, asked if I would still be able to receive the breakfast special for the same price which was supposed to end at 11:00. The owner responded \"No way, It ended at 11:00\". I left right away. Such a turn off when an owner wont even try satisfy a student by giving them the special a couple minutes after the time. Instead of him not gaining a $2 profit on my special, he lost my entire $12 bill and all of the other profits I would have brought if I was given decent service. Rude."}
{"text":"Dependable is the name of the game here! Have a burger or a club sandwich for lunch. Salad lovers or vegans need to hit the bricks and move on. I've been a regular customer on and off for more than ten years and never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"got fish & chips. very generic diner. credit card not accepted."}
{"text":"I can't stress enough how bad this experience was. In a city with so many options, do yourself a favor and go anywhere else. I tried to order a grilled bacon and egg sandwich, which is on the menu and he told me he couldn't do that. Without cheese it wouldn't stick together. (The menu item didn't have cheese). So, I am a good sport. \"Okay, thanks for the recommendation. Bacon, egg and cheese then.\"  He charged $1 extra for that cheese. Making my sandwich $7.   Someone else asked if the egg in their sandwich could be scrambled instead of fried. He said \"maybe.\"  There is only 1 other customer in the restaurant, not table of customers--just one old man.  My husband wanted decaf coffee. The had instant. I ordered tea. It was the sweetest syrup-y poured from a bottle of tetley that I could imagine. One sip. I didn't drink it. $2.25 wasted.  The bathroom downstairs is something to experience. You have to duck to get in. Clean though."}
{"text":"Cool neighborhood coffee shop that's not open at night or on Sundays. If you're looking for a greasy breakfast joint for eggs and bacon, this is it.   this is not a place for fancy brunch with your girl."}
{"text":"Greasy spoon? YES PLEASE. I love this little place. Very diner-esque -- something like out of the movies. Fastest service ever. I can't really recall what I ordered -- probably something on the line of like.. the \"usual.\" Got me two eggs, over easy, toast, some sausage, home fries. Y'know the deal. Absolutely love this place, it's so cute and so cheap. No complaints there."}
{"text":"Authentic diners have achieved dinosaur status in the city. Within the last few years, popular greasy spoons have been forced to close their doors with only a few surviving members, one of them is the Patrician Grill.   Opened since the late 60s, the Patrician Grill offers no frills in its decor and food. Quick and simple meals are found on the menu in the family-owned and run establishment. Sit at the counter to watch the cooks create your meal or retreat in one of the leather booths while sipping your morning coffee.  All day breakfasts are a popular order, as well as homemade burgers and their classic BLT sandwich, which is cheap and full of flavour. Local business people and college students from nearby George Brown flock here for no-nonsense comfort food. \"Eat here, diet at home\" is the motto at the Patrician Grill and is practiced daily by its loyal patrons."}
{"text":"I have to amend my previous review a bit. I visited this restaurant for lunch today and found that their lunch options are quite a bit less appealing than the breakfast. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and it was cold, small, and absolutely not worth the $11 it cost. Stick to breakfast if you decide to try this place."}
{"text":"Breakfast is cheap at $8.75 taxes in for 3 eggs, 3 sausages, potatoes, toast and coffee. We received our food quickly but never checked up on. No offer for more coffee or juice refill. Whoever served us didn't really make eye contact with us when we ordered but seemed friendly and social with others in the restaurant who were regulars. Its a nice, nostalgic establishment with simple food, just wish they gave us more of an experience to come back.   Cash only. There's a sign that says \"ATM\" but I didn't see the machine."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. How many authentic diners are left?  Good food and good service at very reasonable prices. It deserves 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while searching for some hangover breakfast food, and couldn't have found anywhere better!  The inside is pretty small and has a classic diner vibe going on. The grill and cooks are right behind the counter and cook everything great and fast.   I ended up ordering a cheese omelette with a side of poutine, and both were cooked exactly how I like it.  It is a little pricier than what you would normally pay for breakfast, but you're in downtown Toronto so it's expected.  Great classic diner, I'll for sure be coming back!"}
{"text":"One of the better diners around....  cheap and laid back, comfy booths, zippy service, stools at a an eat-at counter - best cheeseburger deluxe around - lots of parking around on the street.....  i drive to get there once a month or so......  love it"}
{"text":"We went for late breakfast on Saturday, it was not too busy, great ambiance - not noisy, nice lively jazz playing quietly in background.  As for the food, oh man we got stuffed. These portions are big but not that large that you cannot finish.  I got greek omelette with home fries - home fries are amazing, omelette is bit bland but pretty tasty (I guess I would've made something like that at home). My partner just swallowed his three eggs with steak which he had medium raw and was impressed with it.  I also got chocolate milkshake that a nice waiter refilled free of charge:) And we shared pancakes. Nothing spectacular but for that price, and with super friendly, easy going customer service, I will definitely come there again. Highly recommend for breakfast and/or brunch.  They have homemade apple pie and homemade rice pudding - I was eyeing those and will definitely try next time."}
{"text":"I think in order to really appreciate this place, one needs to be a frequent visitor/resident/employee in the King East area.  There's really nothing spectacular about the Patrician, yet it remains somewhat of an institution for those in the area.  Terry, the owner, is a charming, yet abrasive individual who remembers his regulars and appreciates his customers.  The rest of the staff are friendly and accommodating to their clientele and offer a friendly neighborhood experience that you don't always find this close to the downtown core anymore.  The interior of the place doesn't look like it's changed since the place opened some 40 years ago, which definitely adds to the appeal.  I think the nostalgia and friendly environment keeps the locals loyal and excited about their mediocre, greasy spoon offerings.  And considering their very reasonable prices, that's more than enough reason for me to keep going back again and again."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast and the vibe in this diner is \"Sopranos\" cool. You can feel an exciting chill in the air...like something unknown is brewing and it's not your coffee :-) Their motto is \"nothing fancy since 1967.\" Which validates the para bing para bang vibe of this diner.  I ordered the vegetarian Omelette with onions green peppers mushrooms, and cheese buttery yummy deliciousness. Came with side of home fries and toast. My better half had three eggs with tomatoes.   This is a place where they follow minimalist approach when it comes to food and let your taste buds do the rest!  Hey \"nothing fancy here since 1967,\" because they know they are doing it right!!"}
{"text":"Unimpressed. Coffee cups are small and without much taste. Omelettes use fake cheese. Wait staff have little personality. All of this is okay if prices accordingly, but prices are on par with some of Toronto's best. Suggest folks check this place out only if the line at Le Petit Dejeuner is unbearable. That's why we are here, this time."}
{"text":"Just like the menu says - nothing fancy since 1953 and it's perfection.  Ordered The Patrician special with salad.  Beautiful and delicious. Bottomless coffee as a great diner would have.  I'm full and happy."}
{"text":"Reasonable diner but nothing special. Eggs tasted very buttery. Service was mediocre but nothing to complain about. Cash only, which would be acceptable if they were a cheap diner but they're not, so they should really get with the times and accept debit at a minimum."}
{"text":"As far as diners in Toronto go, this is one of the best.   Popped in for a cheap lunch after spending way too much on furniture a few blocks away and we were not disappointed. I got the Patrician sandwich which is a pumped up BLT with cheese and an extra slice of mayonnaised white bread in the middle. It comes with their house slaw, and it's a god damned masterpiece.   If you like comfy plastic booths, surly men who know their way around a griddle and the smell of bacon in the air, this place is for you. If you want to pay $23 for an eggs Benny with a whimsical twist, you and Patrician probably won't jive."}
{"text":"This is my breakfast spot and since moving from the neighborhood its also become the place I miss the most in the area. I have been there for lunch a few times and everything I have had has been great but for me its all about the breakfast and I'll say that it is one of if not the best simple breakfasts in the city."}
{"text":"Don't come here with food allergies. We're regulars here and they made a mistake today by putting cheese on my husbands burger after I specifically ordered no dairy. Hey scraped the cheese off and reserved it. Cheap. What's worse is when we told them the waitress asked if it would be ok to scrape it off!! We were embarrassed FOR HER. Never been bold faced asked that before and we've dined at some dives. UNREAL THAT THEY ASKED AND THEN ACTUALLY DID IT. Now my husband is sick. Allergies are as real their ignorant asses."}
