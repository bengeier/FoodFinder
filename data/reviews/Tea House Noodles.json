{"text":"I picked this place because it was close to the Hyatt, where I was staying. The reviews were all really high so I was excited to go but was pretty let down. Maybe it's because I know what Asian food should taste like? It was generally healthy, which I liked but that is one of the few things I liked about it.   *service: pretty good. I went later in the lunch hour but it was so busy. They got the food to me quickly which was good. They seemed haphazard but overall they were very nice.  *pad thai: tasted nothing like real pad thai. It was a peanut sauce which was good, but not pad thai. The chicken was dry and bland. All together it tasted fine but I wouldn't order it again.  *regulars: a lot of regulars were coming in, which was nice to see. This place seems like a staple in the area.  *authenticity: not at all. I get what the word fusion means, but it wasn't fusion...and it wasn't Asian.   I wish I liked it more. The regulars seem to like it so maybe they know what to order and I don't. Or maybe we just have completely different tastes...."}
{"text":"Nothing beats a Freakin' Rican on a cold Friday in February!  Chicken, tofu, rice, various beans and veggies kicked up a notch with the sweet and spicy Rica Rica sauce.  The portion is large enough for me to have a light lunch and extra for dinner.  Or a snack.  On second thought, I might just finish it up now!  The food is fresh and healthy but definitely is not lacking in flavor.  The staff are friendly, fast, and accurate.  So go there now.  You're welcome."}
{"text":"This place definitely serves the need for different tastes. One of the hardest things that restaurants do is trying to meet the needs of everyone, and/or taking special requests. The Tea House Noodles is geared specifically to individual customers. You can create your own noodle and rice dish. I got a Flat Thai Noodle dish with chicken. It was really good! You got a lot for $8.99. The workers are friendly, too."}
{"text":"We waited an hour for our food to leave the location, okay, it was lunch time, they are 20 minutes late. The food was not good at all. I bought my boss lunch, misu soup with noodles, she would not even eat it after one bite. This being my first experience I was so let down. it's a bunch of shaved ice berg with onions, not ONE snap pea. The broth tasted like absolutely nothing with a hint maybe chicken broth somewhere in there. I wouldn't have even paid $2 for this. I will NOT be eating here again and I will recommend everyone in my company do the same."}
{"text":"From out of town and stayed next door at the holiday inn. Had a late lunch with a buddy and was thoroughly impressed. So much noodles! Good portions for the price. If I'm in Cleveland in the future I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"this is a perfect place to eat lunch fast, even if there is a line out the door.  the staff  deals with huge crowds everyday without missing a beat and the food is comforting and delicious!  the lime-aid that they serve compliments everything i have ever eaten there and i am always happy to see tofu on the menu.  i am such a fan of the rica-rica sauce, whats in there??  only wish i could get my hands on this for dinner!!"}
{"text":"I way underestimated Tea House Noodles. Since my last review I've been in many times and get the Pad Thai NO VEGGIE, which makes all the difference. It is to DIE for and WAY better than Noodlecat. Plus it's cheap. Rock on Tea House Noodles, rock on."}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot downtown.  TeaHouse is tucked away at the end of Short Vincent where you always feel the ghosts of the Cleveland Mob in their heyday.  What do I love about this place?  It's great, fresh, healthy and cheap.  My \"standard\" is the brown rice bowl, topped with steamed veggies an extra Rica Rica sauce.   The Rica Rica is a sweet and hot chili sauce from the Pacific Rim.  Sometimes I top my bowl with chicken or tofu but sometimes I just buy it without the protein.  Another favorite are the Freakin' Rican Beans.  I love Rica Rica so much I literally do buy it by the case for my home.  You can buy it by the bottle, but they have not found a distributor yet to sell it more conveniently.    The service is very fast since the menu is limited.  I highly recommend this set up in the form of a food truck since not much space is needed.  The employees are very nice and will always let you sample the sauce before you order it.    I always get a glass of their lime-aid and never anything else to drink.  Their smoothies are good too, but I just don't do many smoothies.  Get their early because there is limited seating.  Most downtowners buy it \"to-go\" and if you get there after 11:45, plan to wait in line outside the door.  Teahouse once opened a place with seating a few blocks away in Reserve Square but it didn't make it :-(    I went there a few times because I was guaranteed a seat.    Teahouse is only open for luch Monday through Friday.  Too bad, but I understand.  Their restaurant in Little Italy is open Saturdays and I think for dinner.  They take credit cards; lunches run about $6 plus a beverage.  Parking is limited at meters.  It's downtown, what do you expect?"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor an order a \"Mey-Thai.\" It's not on the menu, but it's a half-tofu, half-four bean medley pad Thai on rice."}
{"text":"This is one the better restaurants in downtown, if you want something quick and healthy. Basically, its like a burrito restaurant. You pick your meat, noodles or rice and sauces. The noodles are fresh and the rice is brown. The sauces are pretty good too. I like the spicy freaking rica rica. They also sell smoothies. I think they are ok, but a little pricey. If you get the bowl, its pretty cheap for a healthy lunch. Some times they have specials depending on the day of the week. Their vegetarian bowl is so good, I didn't miss the meat."}
{"text":"We order out for Thai food on a weekly basis so have a high standard to compact to. The noodle tea shop had excellent food, fresh, nicely spiced, yummy. Only the Pad Thai was below expectation. Everything else was really excellent and so, so, so affordable. Go there if you can!"}
{"text":"On a quick business trip to Cleveland, I could not take yet another hotel lunch so ventured out to find something local and good and this place was perfect! Simple --  you pick your noodle or rice (all with the freshest veggies ever), a sauce, and a protein and viola the most sumptuous bowl comes your way! And if you are gluten free -- not worries -- they will tell which combos are safe! Try the fresh squeezed juices as well the carrot ginger yumyum!"}
{"text":"I'm sitting here in my office trying to finish this rice bowl and I'm struggling a bit.  Maybe it's the sauce that I got (sweet-red hot sauce) but I'm just not digging this meal.  I didn't watch the entire preparation but I think there is a reason why this food is served so quickly.  It is all premade/precooked ingredients with sauce added on top after the fact.  Thus, the sauce doesn't permeate the meat or vegetables.  In this case that is probably a good thing as this sweet hot sauce is pretty terrible.  And I'm not picky - I am happy with most food court quality sauces.  PROS -quick service  -chicken was cooked well and in a respectable portion -vegetables were fresh -service and staff were great  CONS -the sauce (and therein the entire meal).  This sauce is honestly quite awful and should not be served in a restaurant.  I noticed another poster said they did not enjoy their sauce either and put Sricha chili sauce on top.  I did the exact same thing.  Thank God I decided to take some to go.  Once I ran out of Sricha I stopped eating.  I mean I can cook chicken and throw Sricha on top (which I wouldn't do because that is nasty) - I am going to a restaurant because I want some creativity and interesting flavor.  Might as well have put ketchup on this thing it might have tasted better. -more on the sauce/preparation, even if I chose another sauce personally I'd rather wait and have my food cooked in the sauce to absorb the flavor and then added to the rice/noodles.  I'd even pay another $1.  OTHER -$8 is not a great price.  I just moved from another city where there are numerous $8 noodle/rice bowls that are WAY better than this.   -I question whether this is healthy food.  meat, vegetables and (arguably) brown rice are healthy.  When you douse them in sweet or spicy sauce you are probably adding a lot of salt and/or sugar which is NOT healthy.  As I said before though the chicken was cooked well (for fast food) and the vegetables were fresh so A+ on that.  I'm not a hater and will try again with a different sauce and hope for a better experience but for now this is a thumbs down for me.   My hope is that I can change this review to 4 or 5 stars as I love the concept - I just think it needs better execution."}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly and fast. The portions are generous for the price. My favorite dish is the Pad Thai. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"On a whim a friend and I decided to give this place a try. The establishment is very clean and well-kept and the service is friendly.  However... the food is just awful. I ordered a veggie dish with a (supposed) Philippine hot-sweet sauce and chicken.  The veggies were boiled down to an uninspired mush that was 80% cabbage, the sauce tasted like ketchup, and the chicken was plain, processed and appeared boiled as well. The food was bland, bordering on disgusting.  The price for a meal seems reasonable but with so many other excellent Asian restaurants nearby I see no reason to try this place again."}
{"text":"Awesome people, awesome food. So helpful and patient with my delivery order questions and the delivery guy was really pleasant.  The prices were great and they did a great job keeping things we were allergic to out of condiment choices and salads. Officially our new fave."}
{"text":"these dudes are FAST. I think i had just gotten out \"noodles- coco ginger- chicken\" and my order was already sitting on the table waiting for me to get it.  and the beverage chic read my flippin mind and already had my limeade sitting there waiting for me.  it took longer for my credit card to go through than the food to order up.  this place is not only fast, but flippin delicious.  you know that butler in mr. deed's?  he's very sneaky, sir. so are the people who work here, apparently. indeed."}
{"text":"drunken review time baybayyyyyy!!!! my hotel offered free drinks so i'm gonna blast you all with a review saying this place be TYYYYTE. i had the pad thai and that Shh was dope. my drinks dun made me hongry. so anyways yall i got the pad thai with 1/2 chicken and half tofuuz. my only question to you is... baby where the rest of my chicken at? it's more like a 2 to 1 tofu to chicken ratio up in this B. but guess what mutha yelpuhz.. 5 stars anyway!! why? because this pad thai explosion in yo face includes a muy dulishee ozo sauce combo that straight up blew my head off into mm mm MMM land! the sauce is exquisite. so good it made me write a yelp review even though ain nobody got time for dat. if youre in cleveland on business or have to hole up downtown - spend some of that per deezy on this thai place fo sheezy. p.s. i love you all and as a bonus review the mega man x series is some real good video games. sincerely, cheese lou weeze."}
{"text":"Just got food here for the first time. I went in knowing that it had gotten high reviews, but not much else. I asked for some help figuring out what I wanted. The woman was super helpful and really was able to key in on my tastes. They let you sample the sauces, which is super helpful when you really just don't know what to get. I ended up with a noodle bowl with rica rica and coco-ginger and shrimp. Great balance of flavor and price!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I was so sad to see the one in Little Italy/University Circle go. It was such a great place to go get a delicious dish that wasn't fried or Italian. So good.  So, when I started working downtown, I obviously got super excited to have Tea House Noodles at my fingertips--almost literally. It takes MAYBE 1.5 minutes to get there now. I keep experimenting with combinations and nothing has really turned me off yet. Tons of veggies, the tofu is good (not rubbery like it can sometimes be), the noodles are fabulous and the service is great. I was so surprised to be greeted by a smile and quick service that didn't make me feel rushed. I have a hard time with decisions and sometimes I need to stand in front of the menu to decide--that's not a problem here and I can't even explain how refreshing that is.   Speaking of refreshing, this food just feels good. It's not heavy and with the way I eat, I can get another meal out of it (it keeps well and can be re-dressed pretty well too--Sriracha or some of your own sauces).  I'd definitely recommend this place to a hungry downtown luncher (or anyone else for that matter) and they'll be getting a lot of my business."}
{"text":"This place is a viable lunch option. Their close to work and deliver, so I have been here at least 3 times. I have tried their pad thai, it's not authentic or that great. I've also tried their smothered chicken, which was a better option than the pad thai. All in all, for around $8 you will get a quick, healthy, lunch. It's kind of like chipotle, but asian inspired. I know some people order something different from here everyday. I don't like it that much, but will suggest you give it a try."}
{"text":"Overpriced \"health\" food. That's what this is. This is an asian restaurant that is cashing in on the health movement within Cleveland (and elsewhere of course) and doing so kinda lazily.   The food isn't executed well....from the noodles, the broths, spices....just the execution....hell the recipes.   Could it be good? Yes. All they need to do is lower their prices 20-30% and revamp their recipes a little bit. Just my take on one visit."}
{"text":"I wish it was open for dinner. Love the choices. So healthy and fresh and delicious. I think the Pad Thai is the best. The portions are huuuuge. Good times."}
{"text":"Great, fast, and healthy downtown lunch! I love personally love the brown rice, four bean medley with the coconut ginger broth. Can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because I love the concept of flavorful and healthy Asian.  I opted for the noodle bowl with chicken and a mixture of coco and curry sauces.  For a meager $6 you get a pile of food!  I didn't read the menu close enough to know that the bowl is assembled with noodles on the bottom, and then a salad mixture of greens, carrots, water chestnuts, snap peas and cucumber.  Then which ever protein and sauce you pick is placed on top.  I found the food to be a bit on the bland side (probably because they don't use salt).  And I did not care for greens but that is my fault.  Maybe if I go back and 86 the greens and put some salt and pepper on it I will feel differently.  Friendly and fast, walk up and carry out service."}
{"text":"I used to come here quite regularly and for whatever reason I stopped. Went back today and it was every bit as good as I remember or possibly better.  The people behind the counter are always very friendly. The food always tastes incredible.    It is a bit of a walk from my job but hopefully time permits for me to start eating here a few times a week.  I can't imagine why anyone would rate this place less than 5 stars."}
{"text":"Tea House Noodles serves delicious food! I live downtown and decided to try something new. I ordered the Pad Thai with four bean medley (I was alone that day) and Tofu. It.was.awesome. I also ordered their Coco Lime Ginger soup, with rice.  That sheeit was sooo good.   I am hooked on that soup.  The food and delivery was so good with my first order ever, that I ordered the same two days later (FYI, they close at 4pm AND are not open weekends - ).  Had the Pad Thai, with chicken as my protein this time. Good!  I had the fresh carrot juice which was delicious -  tho not made with organic carrots.?  There is consistency with this place.  A few days later, I ventured into the physical place. The 'owners' were friendly, tho not Thai. Watever. Good healthy food."}
{"text":"TeaHouse noodles is a difficult place to review. On one hand, they have some very tasty and healthy combinations, however you can quite easily stray into no-mans-land with some of the combinations available on the menu.  Don't be afraid to ask for a recommendation on what's popular if you have not been here before.  If you're new to TeaHouse, you can't go wrong with one of the premade options such as the pad thai, freakin' chicken or Asian chicken chili over rice.  These will help introduce you to the sauces and give you an idea on how to build your own bowl to achieve a good flavor profile.  I usually ask for easy sauce on any of the dishes, as they can be a little overwhelming with sauces (though they are very good). It can be on the messier side to eat, especially over noodles as they have a tendency to fling sauce every which way.  Overall, TeaHouse is a good place for a quick, healthy meal and great option for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Tried tofu for the first time here on accident.  The Frikan RIcan was terrific!  Delicious, healthy, protein packed bowl of deliciousness. If I lived or worked near here this would become a quick addiction!"}
{"text":"ASIAN CHILI ALL DAY!  I haven't tried anything besides the chili and I have eaten there 20 + times.  I am probably missing out, but I don't really care to find out since I love the chicken chili so much.  I add a little sriracha to mine to kick it up a notch."}
{"text":"Service fast and efficient; once I ordered on phone for curbside pick up and the transaction was pretty good since I hadn't paid on phone! The server rushed to settle dues. Pad thai is yum!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, just terrible. Bland, overcooked rice noodles in yellow water (no ginger or lemongrass flavor at all), razor thin slices of old carrots, and shredded to mush bok choy and scallions on top. 1 tiny, lousy pea pod. Did I mention it was bland? Like, worse than hospital food tasteless level.  You've been warned."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh - if this place existed in Orlando I would eat here all the time. I'm iffy on noodle bowl places because they're usually either all noodles or too manufactured to have any flavor. Tea House is neither, and I am in love.  One thing that turns me off about little places like this is when you walk in and don't know exactly what you're doing and what you want, they treat you like dirt. The staff were so far from that - warm, inviting, and made you feel like you were a regular (I watched them with several other first timers and regulars and everyone got the same level of excellent care).  I ordered a lot because I knew I'd want food for a few days in my hotel room since I wasn't going to be leaving much. I tried the standard pad thai, a noodle bowl with the ginger-coconut broth and chicken, and two of the vegetable steamed buns, plus the fresh limeade.  The ginger coconut broth had a wonderful flavor and just enough so it wasn't soupy but wasn't dry either. It infused into the noodles so well that I'm sure it's just going to taste better as I eat it the next few days. The bowl was huge, too, and a good balance of noodles, well cooked veggie mix, and tender, moist chicken. Very mild spice, but didn't warrant any additional sriracha as I didn't want to ruin the delicate coconut sweetness and bitter ginger.  The pad thai was just as delicious, a bit more on the creamy peanut side, but again, too flavorful to add more heat. Freshness just as outstanding there, too, the tofu was nice and firm.  I won't say much about the veggie buns - they're frozen packaged, but good quality and they were steamed perfectly, so I'll give them a thumbs up anyway. I mainly used them as a vehicle to try two of their other sauces that piqued my interest - the curry and the famous Rica Rica. The curry was probably my only complaint - a bit sour and just not pleasing to me. The Rica Rica is a version of your standard sweet thai chili sauce with a hidden kick. Not something I'd call hot, but a pleasing little tingle that went well with the sweetness. I can see why they bottle and sell it - I just might pick up a bottle after I'm done here.  The limeade was just as fresh as claimed.  The whole bill came to $23 and I will be able to easily get 3-4 meals out of this. The bowls are huge and packed to the brim, the buns are huge - I will have happy leftovers!  So hey, if you guys are reading this, you made the night before all my medical tests much better with your tasty food and hospitality. If you ever want to relocate to Orlando I will totally support you!"}
{"text":"I scoured the area for something with curry... something spicy... anybody?  This is what I came up with.  So I headed down to Tea House Noodles at 4pm on a Monday.  Closed.  Apparently they close at 3:30.  This is very very important information.  I even visited their website before I went and saw nothing of a 3:30 closing.  Whatever... it was nice out, so I'm not going to complain too much.  I made a note and headed back on a Thursday at noon for a quick lunch.  The place has a following, I'll give it that.  The line-up was out the door and I was excited for some yummy noodles slathered with curry.  Once I reached the counter, I placed my order:  Thai Noodles w/ Curry Sauce & Chicken and a side of rice.  The staff was friendly but the food was bland and unappetizing.  I ate about 20% of it and then tossed it.  The rice was cold, the noodles soggy, the chicken processed, the curry lumpy.  I was disappointed because I really wanted this place to be as good as the line-up suggested.  I guess there just aren't many options for the office workers downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"I dont write novels for reviews.....Just the facts.  Soooo here we go.  1. Location- A great little hideaway that makes you feel local for finding it.  Plenty of street parking and withing walking distance to most working downtown.  2. Price & Quantity- For under ten bucks you can eat anything off the menu. If you can finish a bowl and still be hungry......well I would be amazed.  Actually I would be suprised you could still fit through the door.  3. Tastiness- Its awesome.  If you looking for something authentic then keep on truckin.  This is Americanized asian food at its finest.  They put their spin on classics and make it their own.  Thumbs up for a creative spin on classic dishes.  4. Staff- Amazingly friendly.  If you look lost and confused when you get there......well they will walk you through the process to ensure you get to eat exactly what is on your mind.  MY OPINION:  RUN DONT WALK TO TEA HOUSE NOODLES!"}
{"text":"This place ROCKS! The sauces are great, the service is fast and the staff is generally nice. I have been to both locations (downtown and little Italy) and have been thrilled with both the noodles and the rice.  You pick your base, noodles or rice. Add a sauce and add a protein. It is fun to mix and match, the servings are the perfect size and most importantly the food is really good and healthy!!!  If there was an East Side location like Eton place, I would eat here every week. Yeah, that is exactly how I feel."}
{"text":"This is not 5 stars as in 'this is the best food you'll ever have'; it's 5 stars as in 'this is the best food you'll have for $7'.  Brown rice and noodle bowls, chicken or tofu, all of which ingredients are of very good quality - and then there are the sauces, which are the real draw. Sweet-hot sauce is what I recommend to the uninitiated, though Rica Rica appears to be the crowd favorite. Daily specials are excellent; Monday garlic ginger chicken and Tuesday smothered chicken are my favorites, but am again overruled by the crowd, which seems to favor Pad Thai Wednesdays and Freakin' Rican Thurs and Fridays. Lines are frequently out the door, and deservedly so - this is the only place I know of locally with this phenomenon. I have taken three skeptics there, and have gone 3-for-3 in converting them to believers.  A must-try."}
{"text":"Looking for the best lunch in Cleveland? Well look no further. Mix and match protein, sauce and rice or noodles and you got a quick inexpensive healthy lunch. Bob and crew will take great care of you."}
{"text":"At 1230 on a weekday had no wait. Got a Pad Thai with chicken and tofu. It wasn't a very traditional Pad Thai, it's sauce was peanuty instead of the usual fish sauce, soy sauce and maybe sugar or lime juice. It was good though. And more than enough to be full at lunch."}
{"text":"Meh.  I have definitely experienced better.   I think Tea House noodles has an identity problem.  It's \"Asian\" in that it serves Asian-inspired food but not really committed to any particular region or cuisine.  I feel like it's food made for people who want to feel like they're eating something ethnic without actually committing to it.  Just dumping a bunch of traditionally Asian foods in broth doesn't make you authentic, it makes you kind of lazy.  Head to this place if you aren't picky but if you're jonesin' for an authentic taste to your meal, skip this joint and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Worst noodles ever. I had the pad Thai and it was more like noodle soup and was way too sweet. I could not even finish it."}
{"text":"I usually pride myself on ordering something new off of a menu when I return to a restaurant, but Teahouse Noodles is the exception because my usual order is tooo good: noodle bowl w/ rica rica sauce, tofu, light on the noodles but with extra vegetables.  Teahouse probably has the most healthful lunches in the downtown area, given that most of the other fast places are chains that use tons of preservatives.  I agree with the other reviewers who are fans of the limeade --so refreshing!"}
{"text":"YUMMY YUMMY IN MY TUMMY!   Researching my company website I came across Tea House Noodles. Thought to myself \"hey~you like Thai right??\" so I decided to try it. And since this has been a repeat lunch adventure. Here's why:   1) Quick and easy. What do they advertise...as easy as 1-2-3-4??? Well it is. Pick your poison off the wall and create something that will be ready in a matter of mere minutes. Maybe 3.   2) Friendly staff. My first time in I questioned different sauces and was allowed to taste and try and mix and match first. Who does that?! They do! ( I would mix the Rica-Rica and Curry sauces together for your bowl)   3) Options. You can come in 5x a week and pick something different. Salads. Bowls. Soups. Rice. Noodles. Veggies. Tofu. Chicken. Shrimp. Sweet. Sour. Hot. You pick and that's the best part!!!   So. I suggest you go in. Say hi. Order in confidence and don't forget your fortune cookie on the way out!:) Oh...and enjoy.   (also available by dt bike courier ...fyi)"}
{"text":"A great hole in the wall find for two fellow out of towners. You'd miss it if you weren't looking for it, but it's a really good place to eat. The noodles with chicken and rica rica sauce was zesty and balanced with the veggies. There were many other items on the menu that I would like to try in the future. They only have plastic utensils are rather flimsy to eat with, a minor inconvenience of dining in."}
{"text":"Awesome.  2x in 2days.  Great food, great people, great price!  Day one ate carry-out.  Day 2 came back with family on a day off and couldn't have been more impressed with the food or people.    Please bring Teahouse Noodles back to WestGate!"}
{"text":"There's not much to say: Delicious fresh food, fast! Not too expensive, either. Grab some noodles and head over to the library park on a nice day."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and outgoing. The guy who served me really seemed to enjoy his job. (Its always a good sign when the employees  are excited about healthy food choices and can tell you exactly what is in the dishes they are serving you) The food was fresh, with some creative sauce mixes and choices.  I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The first time I had Teahouse was nearly 16 yrs ago. It was delicious then and it is now. I've ordered the noodle bowl with chicken and rica rica sauce (my favorite) standing in line during the lunch hour rush, I've called ahead and ordered, and has had my noodle bowl delivered. No matter how my food came to me, it was hot and tasty. I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to experience something different for a change. The noodles does not make it carb friendly, but it's a good cheat meal! Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"I needed a quick lunch while working downtown, so I stopped in and grabbed a veggie bowl with tofu and rica-rica sauce.  The dining room itself has small, high tables, perfectly fine for eating in but not filled with ambiance that demands one to take a seat instead of takeout.  Like the other reviews state, this place is super-speedy.  My meal was ready in less than a minute.  I received a bowl full of different vegetables that were crisp and flavorful, topped with a generous serving of extra firm tofu.  The tofu was itself unflavored, probably to allow it to go with any sauce, but some spicing might have been nice.  The rica-rica sauce definitely measures up to the hype.  It is sweet with just enough heat, not too far from a sweet and sour chili sauce but still unique.  My main complaint is that the food was literally drowning in it.  I am not a huge fan of heavy dressing, so I ended up draining off a quarter cup.  I'd suggest ordering the sauce on the side so that you can add however much you want if you like light dressing.  However, if the summer wasn't so short, and there weren't so many lunch spots to try in Cleveland, I'd return for a decent, reasonably priced, generously portioned and relatively healthy lunch."}
{"text":"Hang on a second -- I need to wipe the delicious noodle soup broth off of my face before I start writing.   ....OK, now that I'm not a huge, embarrassing slob I can tell you why I L.O.V.E. Tea House Noodles so much.   This place is right up my alley. Quick, cheap, healthy noodle and rice bowls with fresh ingredients and a spicy-kick to boot. Or in simpler terms: Om nom nom. It doesn't get much better than this -- well, maybe if they delivered out in Ohio City.   My first encounter with Tea House was exactly the opposite of what I was expecting. Being the Yelp addict that I am, I obviously checked out what everyone had to say before I ventured over. On my way there I was preparing myself for a fast-paced, hectic line in which this indecisive gal would have to figure out what I wanted without much thought. *Oh, the horror!* I was getting worried already.   Luckily that wasn't the case! I walked in during a slow time, talked to the gentlemen working about what I should get on my first visit and he was so patient! He deserves a badge of honor for putting up with me.   I adapted the flow of this place quickly: Pick brown rice or rice noodles, a sauce/ broth and a protein. There are a few options beyond those, but that's the gist of how it works. I love spicy foods, but I'm not a fan of sweet. Therefore the gentlemen suggested a noodle bowl with the chicken broth and diced chicken. I added hot sauce on my own and voilà -- instant, warm, happiness in my growling stomach. With every order you get some scallions, freshly steamed veggies and sesame seeds in your bowl. Afterward your body will be asking you why you haven't treated it this good before now.    This place is the *perfect* lunch destination in my opinion for a few reasons:  1) Variety! There are so options that you'll never get bored or feel like you're eating the same things all the time. There are at least 10 different sauces and broths and they have daily specials during the week. Plus you can combine different things to truly make it your own. Although, I'm still a Tea House Noodle amateur. You have to be a pro for that level or mixology!  2) It's healthy! Maybe it's just me, but I like to know what I'm eating. Here there is no question. Everything is fresh, in it's purest form and ready for slurping! (That is, if you're a noodle bowl fanatic like me.) They even have freshly squeezed juices, smoothies and salads!  3) It's fast! I know I already mentioned this, but how often can you get something this good for you in a flash? It's right downtown, easy to walk to and you can even order online for delivery. I honestly can't think of a reason NOT to eat here.      So, yeah. If you couldn't already tell, I'm a fan. The only downside I can see are the hours...Oh and the $6 minimum on credit card purchases. *Sigh* Welp, I guess you can't have it all."}
{"text":"Amazing! The pad Thai is so great with peanut and rican sauce. Ginger dressing on salad is perfect. Made a good choice for lunch today and will 100% be back soon!!! Customer service was very friendly and helpful, which always adds bonus points."}
{"text":"Had a blast here - the food was great, and prepared around our (vegan) dietary needs.  Thanks so much!!!   Even got to chat with the owner about their trips to and from Chautauqua :)"}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot. I seriously crave the Pad Thai eveytime I work in Cleveland. Always super fast and always super delicious. They also do curb side pick up,  just call and order and they will bring it out to your car!"}
{"text":"This place is great for a cheaper healthier lunch option downtown. Its fast, and full of regulars. I get my brown rice, tofu and peanut sauce with a side of siracha. It's great."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant in bustling Uptown area near Case Western. All fresh ingredients with lots of vegetarian options. Pick noodles or rice, add your protein, veggies, pick a sauce. Quick and yummy. Staff is friendly and very nice. Pad Thai really good and steamed rolls are really good."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for a healthy, good bite. I had the noodle, rica rica, chicken combo. Excellent. The green tea topped with lime-aid was tasty too. Excellent value."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after walking by it for months! I ordered  rice bowl with the peanut sauce and chicken. After inquiring about the \"rica rica\" sauce, the owner gave me some on the side and told me to mix it with the peanut sauce...and it was unbelievably delicious!! Very large portion and extremely tasty!!"}
{"text":"I think I like the atmosphere of that place better than the food..noodles are just noodles... I would add a variety... Also, there is no way to opt for a certain kind of veggies... They come pre mixed. I added chicken, which was just a plain chicken..I gave it two tries and now I know it's just not for me.. But the people who work there are super awesome!"}
{"text":"It's easy to miss this little place, but you will be glad you found it.    The ingredients are super fresh and everything is made to order with a very short wait.  Mine was ready in 2 minutes.  The service is also super friendly and fast.  I got the Pad Thai and it was very good, but not your traditional version, as this one has peanut sauce.  The limeade was good but pretty weak.  The chicken noodle bowl's broth was a little thin, but the greens were great, like a salad.  I will definitely be back, and have found a great alternative to overpriced Noodle Cat."}
{"text":"Friendly and quick service but food is mediocre. I had the noodles with 1/2 Rica Rica sauce, 1/2 curry sauce, with chicken. Sauces are decent, but chicken is dry and unseasoned."}
{"text":"I love the freshly pressed apple juice from here. The prices were reasonable. I appreciate the healthy and delicious menu. Will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Such a nice surprise!  We ordered delivery and were amazed at how fast our order arrived. The people are very pleasant and the food is delicious! It is definitely a fusion of Asian influence fused with fresh and healthy. The Pad Thai isn't traditional, but is a healthy, fresh, and tasty version. The sesame ginger noodle salad is very good and the fresh squeezed limeade was very refreshing!   We will definitely enjoy Tea House Noodles again, before we head home!"}
{"text":"The place really disappoints. Their sauces are actually great but the noodles are limp, lackluster, and tasteless. Perhaps I am spoiled because I am from a city where there are some amazing noodle and ramen places but this place is does not come close. I honestly just go there to pick up their side salads (which are awesome) and just skip the noodles all together."}
{"text":"I love Tea House Noodles! There are so many combinations of bowls available, you can change it up every year time you go. I love that there are veggie options as well."}
{"text":"this is, simply, the best place in cleveland -- maybe...the world  nothing tops the rica rica sauce -- for which, thursdays and fridays are the best days of the week -- and, of late, while trying...the other sauces, the pad thai...has really grown on me -- superb  then there are...the fresh juices, the funky teas, their...lime-ade, but, most importantly, the people there -- by far, the best"}
{"text":"Kim's QATTPR (Quick And To The Point Review).  IN THE FORM OF GREATNESS Chicken Noodle Rica could possibly be the best dish on planet earth.  This magnificent noodle bowl come with steamed napa cabbage, bok choy, pea pods, carrots, water chestnuts, green onions and sesame seeds.  Basically everything you need in life is incorporated in this dish well except red wine or liquor however, we are talking lunch time here so with that being said this is a winner winner chicken.... lunch!  MIXED FEELINGS The Coco-Ginger sauce is a bit weak however, a quick two step to the condiment stand will solve this problem.  Why yes for here it sits the heavenly Sriracha Hot Sauce, pick that bad boy up and add a few thousand squeezes to your coco-ginger sauce and you've got yourself an exquisite sauce fit for a Thai King.   BAD TO THE BONE Limited seating is a bummer given the fabulous music piped through this joint.  Long lines during prime time lunch hours is a bit of an upset however, I personally would wait two years in the Sahara Desert without water or sunscreen to enjoy just one small fork full of this insanely delicious chow.  peace, blessing, salad dressing  The Kim"}
{"text":"This was pretty awful.  It's basically a make your own noodle bowl place where you can choose noodles or brown rice, protein, and sauce.  You don't get to choose your veggies; there is a predefined blend that they toss into your bowl.  This sort of cookie-cutter noodle concept is a decent idea, and it's very efficient, but it is hard to pull off well.    Here, the the noodles were undercooked, the meat was bland and the veggies were stale.  I was particularly disappointed by the veggies; I mean, if you get your veggies from a big veggie bucket that's been lying around wilting all day, how can they be fresh?"}
{"text":"Some of my vegetarian friends are always about some tofu. I tried it once, and like any new food, I tried it without any sauces or seasonings. It was terrible. Then I somehow ended up with the \"tofu noodle rica\" bowl from teahouse. Damn that Rica-Rica sauce... Without the chicken distracting from the sauce, it was even better. They know they have you hooked once you try it. That's why they sell it by the bottle. If you bought a case of this stuff and sold it out of town, you would pretty much be a dope dealer. But it would be sauce. You would be a sauce dealer. Dealing Rica Rica sauce."}
{"text":"I ordered noodles with a peanut sauce and it was just overloaded with sauce...I would go back for a 2nd chance but ask them to take it easy on the sauce."}
{"text":"Perhaps I just didn't order correctly.  But the food I got was pretty bland and tasteless and what I did taste was not good.  We got the order delivered which was nice but it took a long time.  2 stars was being gracious in my mind."}
{"text":"Fast, cheap, and tasty noodles and rice bowls Sauces vary from Teriyaki to Thai peanut sauce The tofu I had with my bowl was very good The rica rica sauce I had with my meal was flavorful, but after a while it was too sweet for me  Tasty limeade too!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night with a group of 4, only ones in the place and received really friendly service. Couldn't find parking with the home Indians game, so ended up paying $5 to park in the 5/3rd garage right across the street.   The pad thai is a generous serving (enough for lunch the next day). Your standard clear noodles in mildly spicy peanut sauce. Had my first steam bun here...aside from the experience of seeing and eating one for the first time, it wasn't really that impressive. Got a side of the mango curry sauce to go with it."}
{"text":"It was good.  I got the noodles, rica rica, half tofu half chicken based on others' reviews.  It was very tasty.  Kind of pricy, but what the heck."}
{"text":"Omg, what can I say... so delicious. Staff are always pleasant, location is clean and easy to get to. Conveniently located in downtown and in uptown. The Asian chicken chili is a reason to live. Teahouse Noodles is one of my favorite things in Cleveland. :)"}
{"text":"I got the veggie bowl with 1/2 chicken and 1/2 tofu with rica rica sauce. While I like the healthy food options and great service, the taste was too Western for me. The rica rica sauce is much too sweet for my taste..."}
{"text":"Rice Noodles, Chicken, Veggies, Peanut, Rica Rica......I could eat this EVERY SINGLE DAY.  It is so delish.    Get a bottle to Rica to go......if you like sweet, spicy, you will not be disappointed.    I now live in Seattle, but my mouth waters every time I think about it, and it will be in the MUST DO list when I come home."}
{"text":"This place is truly a hidden gem. I love it! I have had several things on the menu but I always come back for the spicy sesame ginger noodle salad, it's soo freakin good! The smoothies are killer good too. I would eat here everyday if I could. do it."}
{"text":"Teahouse noodles serves some delicious dishes that everyone should try.  Everything I've had here is spicy, but I've only eaten here twice.  The food is very unique.  The noodles are home made and are served with your choice of a variety of toppings.  I don't recommend this place if you're a big eater because the portions are small.  I usually buy a bottle of Rica Rica sauce on my way out, which I use for cooking at home.  http://www.teahouse-noodles.com/"}
{"text":"So I've been working downtown for about a year now and I've tried only a few places (I tend to pack my lunch most days) but whenever I go for a walk, I walk past Tea House Noodles. This little (and I mean little) spot is located on East 6th street and you wouldn't think anything of it if you just were walking by. I've been told its pretty good by colleagues so I figured I would treat myself today.   After the short walk to the restaurant, I walked in and there were 3 employees working. The spot has a very small amount of tables and it would be crowded if there were more than 3 parties eating in there, so I opted to take it back to my office. The menu is displayed on the wall to your right when you walk in and essentially you are given 3 choices noodle/rice/veggie/Pad Thai-sauce-protein. I went with the noodle/rica-rica sauce/chicken combo and it ran me $8.49 (which I felt was a fair price). I also was greeted promptly and to be honest my meal was ready in less than 1 minute, which scared me a little bit. I had also already checked out the menu before I came and I had already decided what I was going to order.   Luckily, the food was tasty, I'm of Asian descent so I really expect a lot comparing it to my mother's cooking but my meal was pleasant. The noodles were a flat thai noodle, which was almost clear in color and had an al dente bite. The rica-rica sauce was orange in color and packed a tiny bit of heat and you get the taste of ginger as well (I very much enjoyed this sauce). The vegetables were fresh but all were not cooked to the same consistency which was disappointing. What was not disappointing was that there were lots and lots of different types of vegetables (water chestnuts, pea pods, green onion, carrots and lettuce accompanied mine). The chicken was bland though, not bad tasting but not what I was hoping for.   Overall if Yelp offered half stars I would give this establishment a 3.5, unfortunately I don't round up so it gets a 3. I thought my meal was a good portion for the price, the speediness of getting my meal was great but just adding some more flavor to the chicken would make for a better dish overall. The employees working were nice and friendly as well which you don't see at a lot of downtown restaurants in my opinion. This isn't a bad place for a quick lunch and I will be back (most likely to try the Pad Thai)."}
{"text":"This is a nice little spot I found when trying to make a quick lunch break. The service was great! The guy at the register was polite and helpful and my food was ready fast. The food was delicious... my only complaint (and why I wouldn't give this place a solid 4) was that for a noodle shop, the noodles were so bland! Now the sauce and toppings were great but that doesn't help when there's just a pile of boring noodles on the bottom. It would have been 10 times better if the noodles had been cooked with the sauce, but it's quick lunch food so I can't expect too much. This is definitely a great little noodle shop to stop at though, if you're in the mood."}
{"text":"Wonderful noodle bowls.  Veggies were crisp, love the giant water chestnuts.  Noodles were not overcooked, the sauce had flavor, very generous portions.  This is the kind of place I will come back again and again.  My only real complaint would be that it's hard to eat your meal with the dinky forks they give out, so byofork I guess.."}
{"text":"The noodle bowl I got had more lettuce than noodles. The sauce (rika+coco ginger) was basically soup and it was hard to eat. I asked for a mix of sauces and they just put the second drizzled on top. Chicken was good but I was not impressed by the rest of my dish."}
{"text":"I ordered through GrubHub...and wow, I was impressed!  Food was quick and tasted amazing!  I got the Pad Thai bowl with tofu and the flavors were perfect!  Great size and prices!"}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from my office.  I yam so lucky!  I eat here constantly, as does nearly everyone else that works in the area.  It's like the Facebook of downtown Cleveland.  You will see people you haven't seen in years!  THE FOOD:  It's a build your own healthy bowl of goodness sort of thing.  You start off with a bowl of brown rice or rice noodles, add some steamed veggies (too much bok choy for my taste, though) add tofu, beans  or chicken and some sauce or broth.  The staff is very cool, so if you feel like mixing rica rica and peanut, hold the scallions, it's completely copasetic.  There are a million combos-- and you can hold the starch if you are feeling all South Beach.  Love the rica rica and the miso/shitake broth.  The turkey chili is a mixture of shredded turkey (natch), the bean medley and rica rica sauce.  Very tasty.    The baked tofu is fantastic.  I'm serious.  Yum.  The Thursday/Friday special-- the Freakin' Rican is soooo good-- beans, olives, veggies, rice, rica rica and chicken or tofu.  Vegans and  veggies can actually find something to eat here.  Carnivores can get some fowl.  Joy!  ATMOSPHERE:  Small and crowded.  There are a few tables, but it's a tight fit.  That being said, it's a pleasant place to wait for your takeout.  SERVICE:  The staff is really nice and accomodating.  They don't mind special orders or creative mixing.  There is always a line out the door.  Never fear, the staff is also very fast!"}
{"text":"Teahouse Noodles serves food that is very delicious, but very specific.  I'm not always in the mood for this style of food, but when I do crave it, there is literally nothing else downtown that comes close.  Like the other posters said, it is one of the best lunch values downtown. Six bucks will get you a huge (enough lunch for two days) serving of noodles, veggies and delicious sauce.   My favorite is the noodle bowl with tofu and Rica Rica sauce.  I don't know what is up with the tofu but it is seriously delicious!! I have never had this kind of tofu anywhere else and can't figure out how to replicate it at home. It is really firm, chewy and has a good, just salty enough flavor. Yum!!  For my annual vegan macrobiotic kick that only ends up lasting about a day and a half before I'm frantically shoving cheese pizza and soda into my mouth, Teahouse is perfect for a cheap, quick macrobiotic lunch of brown rice, steamed veggies, tofu and miso broth.  Everyone at Teahouse is super friendly, and fast!!  Even if the line is out the door, rest assured that you will be in and out within three minutes."}
{"text":"Well not sure why some give this place low marks. It's as advertised and its \"GOOD\"!  Had dinner and this is a solid 4-stars for the following reasons:  - Good selections  - Good pricing  - Great food  This place offers a nice selection of carnivores treats, and vegetarian alike. The sauces and combinations are endless in making your meal special and to your own taste. I got the rice bowl and teriyaki sauce and the sweet steamed bun. Added the homemade limeade and this meal went from a typical Asian to heavenly bliss. Those that say this is a healthy place are right it offers an alternative to typical fried and bathed in oil food. It's not fancy, it is just good unpretentious food at a good price.   I ate well and did not feel I needed to go out and get more to eat. I suggest proteans chicken and shrimp combo. Going to Tea House Noodles is well worth the effort to get there with the construction in the area, and eat a good meal."}
{"text":"Gotta say, even as a harden New Yorker I loved this place.  Super clean, order as you like thoughtfully prepared, fresh Asian inspired noodle, rice or soup bowls.  Check out the shrimp with Coco Ginger sauce it's so yummy.  If this place was in NYC there would be a line around the block.  Thanks for the smoothie taster cup... Banana was to die for ."}
{"text":"Tea House Noodles is a good place to grab lunch downtown. The staff is very friendly and the line moves fast. Seating is limited and it can be difficult to find a table at the peak of lunch hour. The customer first picks if it will be a rice or noodle dish, second a sauce and an optional third protein item. They also offer daily specials for around $6.00. They have fresh squeezed juices, smoothies, salads and soups. Tea House Noodles is a better option than the Chinese buffet downtown."}
{"text":"Why, why why did I not read the other yelp reviews before going here?  If I were rating myself as a patron - one star. I stopped in and got the daily special because I was in a rush. I did not get the rica rica sauce. I did get the garlic ginger chicken. It did not blow me away. But I was clearly confused and rushed through my order. Phoned it in by getting the daily special. I can do better. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I don't even know why this place has noodle in its name, the noodles weren't even very good.  The sauces were mediocre at best.  It all seemed very corporate.  Have some self respect and find Asian food made by Asians not hipsters.  Then again if you are just looking for something quick to eat with an \"Asian flair\" because you are multicultural and sophisticated like that, don't because the only one you're fooling is yourself."}
{"text":"This place is great, Asian with a hip twist of NY. The menu is simple, healthy, and affordable. This is a great place for lunch but it is small so seating is limited. I saw lots of business people getting food to go. You can order online and they will do curbside delivery if you like. Hours are 1030am - 8pm. All the sauces are yummy and mixing them is fun too. If you are not big on sauces just ask for it on the side and add as you like. I was not disappointed with my visit and will return next time I pass through Cleveland."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai was disappointingly bland and tasteless, and the peanut sauce just wasn't right.  While I won't argue that everything looked and tasted fresh, the food was simply not authentic."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to visiting this place so much, but my visit left me very disappointed. This is a very American establishment that is trying to do its own take on Asian food.  I got the pad thai because that's my favorite food. When I ordered it, the guy behind the counter let me know that they don't add eggs or fish sauce to the pad thai because \"that's kind of gross\".   When I got my dish (which was very quick, and pretty-looking), it turns out it was just a bunch of dry noodles in the bottom, with some veggies and sauce tossed on top. Everything had to be mixed together, and nothing was sautéed in a pan together.  No big surprise, the pad thai was not at all what I hoped or expected. It wasn't terrible, but the sauce was more of like a thin peanut butter that I had to stir into everything.   For $8.99, it was really not worth it. Despite my passionate love of both tea and noodles, this place unfortunately left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Excellent food, prompt delivery. A little too prompt - I ordered for a specific time and got it about an hour early. So apparently specifying a time is useless. But otherwise, very good! I've had the pad thai and freakin' rican, and both were excellent. Their tofu is nice and firm, veggies were crisp, and spices were nice and had a kick without being overwhelming."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. Great experience!  Placed a lunch order online but arrived a few minutes early. They hadn't made my bowl yet so that it was fresh upon pickup. Very thoughtful. I had the chicken and rice bowl with coconut ginger sauce. I'm not a big Asian food eater but this was fantastic. I may have to get it again tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Great place. Nice staff. Build your own noodle or rice bowl.  Would recommend to a friend"}
