{"text":"Good service, good pizza and options of shawarma, falafel or pita if you're in the mood for something else."}
{"text":"Been a client of Pinoli since when they were located on CDN road. I love their pizza. Always full of toppings and fresh.
I go there often!"}
{"text":"Decent NY style pizzas, only thing I like are there cheese pizzas (which is as it should be for NY style). A bit on the salty side, but I still come back for more."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza for delivery at 715 tonight. Spoke to a girl to confirm my order and then called back for the total. I called back an hour later at 820 and then the same girl says: \"please confirm your adress\"...so i do. She then then says: \"What did you order again? Yes. We're making it now (clearly lying)\"
Terrible terrible place."}
{"text":"We've been waiting over an 75 minutes for pizza -- and we live 5 minutes away! What the hell, Pinoli?"}
{"text":"This place is great, authentic home made pizza and its very cheap. If you eat in its two for one pizzas. 

Same price point as Double pizza but way way better. Go there."}
{"text":"I would leave this place no stars if possible ,my friend and I got pizza here sat night we both got Mexican slices . At the time we thought it was ok but about an hour after. We both got sick and what I would call food poisoning !!  Diarrhea . The shivers and aching everywhere . There's no question in my mind it was this place Cause this is the only place I've eaten all day ! And my friend got sick here too! Stay away !"}
{"text":"I don't get the negative reviews. I have ordered way too many times to be healthy from this place and EVERY single time the pizza is insanely good. I have tried quite a few different items and I have never been disappointed. Granted, the delivery takes a while, but all you have to do is plan for that. Way better pizza quality than a lot of other \"fast food\" places around. Eat some!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza from them it took 1:45 minutes to be delivered called after 1 hour they said it was in the car called again 20 minutes later same lame excuse finally came needles to say cold and terrible. Called owner to complain. He couldn't care less. Save yourself aggravation and money order elseware"}
{"text":"Je suis passée prendre une pointe de pizza végé rapidement avant le boulot. 

L'employé était en grande discussion sur son cellulaire à mon arrivée, puis il a continué à jaser pendant ma commande (pointer une pizza du doigt, c'était pas trop difficile, mais j'aurais aimé avoir un p'tit bonjour). 

Bonne pizza, bons ingrédients, sans être hors de l'ordinaire. Servie un brin pas assez chaude, mais bon, j'étais pressée. J'étais contente de la recevoir dans une vraie assiette, c'est-à-dire pas en carton, parce qu'à force d'utiliser des assiettes de carton en mangeant de la pizza, on va déforester le Mont-Royal, hein! 

Lorsque j'ai eu terminé de manger, une troupe de joyeux adolescents est entrée et à ce moment, la grande discussion sur cellulaire a heureusement pris fin. À ma sortie, un chaleureux merci m'a été adressé. Ça m'a fait sourire, même si c'est la moindre des choses! ;)"}
{"text":"Great Pizza! You got to try the Meat Lovers pizza! Delivery is fast, but the pizza wasn't delivered at an appropriate temperature! Delivery Lady was really nice! Price is AMAZING! i could not believe that for 40$ we got 2 very large pizzas that fed, 5 people with leftovers!"}
{"text":"Got delivery of a pepperoni calzone and four cheese pizza. They were alright, though I think they would've certainly been better if eaten at the place and not after delivery time elapsed.

It costs about $35, which compared to Atlas' deal of getting two larges for under $30, wasn't a great deal. Would probably go with Atlas again next time."}
{"text":"Oh boy... where do I begin. I went here during the holidays last Dec under a friends opinion that Pizza Pinoli has to be one of the best local poutine places around vendome. Ok, so I took one of my friend on vacation from New York along the adventure with me to this place in one of the 'your suicidal if youre out on this cold' night. Freezing out only added in my to determination to get my hands on some great poutine. I walked in and the unfriendly staff could not have made my visit colder then the weather outside. When they took the order the people kept rushing as if we were unwelcome. We sat and waited only to get stale pizzas. And the poutine that I was looking so forward to could not even beat Burger King's 4.79 + tax. After seeing and tasting the food even I wanted to get out of the place as fast as the staff seemed like they wanted us out of there. The visit seemed like an average quick meal outside and not at all where students come chill out over fries and pizzas.

Verdict: Even Im not going back myself :S"}
{"text":"Pizza Pinoli is great! It's been my go to pizza place for the last 5 years. The staff is friendly and the pizza is always on point. Get a Medium cheese pizza and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Im sure a lot has changed now but when i was a little girl I loved this pizza shop. I now live in sunny california and have tried a lot of pizza but still haven't had anything as good as this pizza! It's been well over five years since I've been here and not sure if its the same owner but if it is ill definitely be back some day!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but this is some of the worst food I've had in a long time. We took the kids and sat outside for pizza this weekend. The pizza and falafel wrap were both really bad. Pizza was soggy, bland, and just not very good. The falafel tasted like it had been sitting around out of the fryer for a while, and had a weird taste of dried spices. 

Big chains like Domino's or Pizza Pizza do it cheaper and better. Not recommended."}
{"text":"I just ordered food from here via Uber eats, and I was horribly dissatisfied with the food that was sent. Mostly picked up dessert items, and was met with a moldy brownie, and a cheesecake with freezer burn. 

This place has lost me as a customer before I even had a chance to try their food. Do not waste your money or time with this establishment unless you are there and are prepared to return it for something resembling edible food, or a refund."}
{"text":"Just if you are hungry and want to eat fast. The chesse was good and the rest ordinary. Nice staff. Terrasse available in summer."}
