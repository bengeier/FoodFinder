{"text":"Expensive fake Italian food - think gummy pasta with sour tomato sauce and veal scaloppine covered with so much bland sauce they're indistinguishable from any of the other slop on the plate. And the whole wouldn't even be so bad if they didn't charge ridiculous prices for their plates.  Our waiter was terrific... The owner and the waitress on the other hand took it upon themselves to hit on my fianc√© while I stood about 2 feet away...going so far as to say that a guy like him wouldn't remain engaged for long! Unprofessional is an understatement."}
{"text":"Very friendly service. Good for family or an elegant night out. Food was incredible. Pizza's were great. Pasta dishes appear small but it will be a challenge to finish. Speaks English as well!"}
{"text":"LOVE this Resto !! Totally wonderful food we were traveling from Miami visiting family in the area and found that Italian Resto we decided to go against that bad reviews ( personal details into a food review normally is not real ) so we went !!  Thank god we did the Owner and Chef is AMAZING !! Food was spectacular enough that we did eat 3 days during our vacation week and were NOT disappointed and the ambiance is wonderful and warm we did have every time best food delicious and memorable !!  So at the end don't believe always personal comment into food review. My take go and you won't be disappointed ."}
