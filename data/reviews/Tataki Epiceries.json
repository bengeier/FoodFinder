{"text":"A small sushi bar / take out tucked in a small store on Duluth between St. Dominique and Coloniale  makes some of the best sushi in the area. The rice is as it should be: tender but slightly al dente, sticks together but not sticky, the right balance of vinegar and sugar. This is the base for the best sushi ! Fresh ingredients and imagination do the rest: a delightful sushi the way you want to have them."}
{"text":"I used to live a block from here so I would always call for pick up on my way home from work. 

The old couple that owns this place are really nice to talk to. They take an interest in your life and seem to genuinely care about what you're doing. They remembered me when I came back after my first visit and even remembered the things I told them about myself (school, work, travel, etc). 

It's not amazing sushi (mind you, Vancouverites are pretty pretentious when it comes to seafood). It's good though, good enough that I keep coming back :)"}
{"text":"I went to this place with a friend because the reviews were excellent on here and it was a block away from my place. Despite being so close to my place, I wont go back. The miso soup tasted sour...like rotten sour. The sushi wasnt bad but it was pretty small. Thats about it.  I really hoped this could have been a regular spot for me get take-out sushi, but I wont go back :("}
{"text":"Rapport qualité prix vraiment intéressant! Bons sushis préparés rapidement devant vous pour pas trop cher."}
{"text":"The sushi here was reeeealllly good! Vast menu makes decision-making difficult. I ordered miso soup for my bf and won ton soup for me. They were really delicious and made to order! We could hear the man in the back chopping up vegetables and making the soups which was nice, and the soups were delicious.

At this point I don't remember what rolls we got, but one I think was the vegetarian roll which was delicious. And the people who work here were so nice. Not much by way of ambience but the food delivers!"}
{"text":"This has long been one of my favorite little places to go to.  There is a lot of sushi competition in the area but really nothing is as good as Tataki.  All the rolls are made by the owners, so quality control is excellent.

I love the \"spring\" rolls, they are delicious and the special tataki sauce is phenomenal.  

Not the nicest dining room experience, very simple decor as the prices are low for the quality.  My favorite little touch they do is the mint in with the tuna maki roll, really distinguishes this place from the others.  Always generous with the fish too which is nice.

Highly recommend, will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding sushi, made fresh in front of you. We took the chef's suggestion for two for takeout and were very pleased with the quality and quantity of food. They gave us a mix of sushi and sashimi, some simple avocado rolls and some exciting deep-fried salmon rolls. The flavours varied widely, which is exactly what we like. Totally worth the money, and the staff are super pleasant to boot!

The decor is fairly simple, but highlights the fact that this place is super clean and organized."}
