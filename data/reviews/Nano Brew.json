{"text":"Worst Bloody Mary I've ever had. The kitchen was very slow and when the food finally did come the order was wrong, resulting in one of the people in our party not eating at all. Wouldn't recommend and won't go back."}
{"text":"First time...   Order three things - 2 different beers listed on the board and one food item from the menu and they were out all 3!  In addition very non-friendly staff!  Would not recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the the hoppin john blackeye pea sandwhich and the boyfriend likes the beef. It was once labeled as grass fed, but we haven't seen that in a while. However, the beer is ALWAYS tasty. Enjoy their giant patio and jumbo jenga game on warm nights."}
{"text":"This place has great customer service and the best waffle fries I've ever had! The bartenders serve you fast and are very personable. And those fries??? AMAZBALLS!!! You get four dipping sauces not that you need any sauce at all because this things are the perfect amount of salty crispy goodness :) I definitely recommend trying them with the spicy cheese with a touch of ranch for a real treat!"}
{"text":"Only reason I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 is because I didn't have the food. The beer selection is great though and the atmosphere is perfect especially on a nice day. The beer garden is really nice and the social tables make it easy to chat up a neighbor."}
{"text":"Extremely rude employees. There were only maybe 8 people in the bar and it seemed like a burden to even get their attention. The one bartender- short with dark-hair/ponytail, made snarky and rude comments towards us and proceeded to laugh with his friends at the bar. Pretty immature and unprofessional.

Employees that are judgmental and rude don't make me want to return. Maybe that's why they were so dead on a nice Sunday afternoon. If you want new customers, you might want to try being polite to all customers."}
{"text":"Nano Brew was a great place to spend a relaxed and casual afternoon on the weekend. The ambience of the outdoor space was wonderful - if you can sit outside, I highly recommend you do it! The beer garden has a great view of the downtown Cleveland skyline, and it was well protected from the sounds/sights of the street by the surrounding wooden walls and bushes/trees.

I ordered the taco Tuesday burger with a black bean patty, and it was delicious. The beer list was reasonable in size. They featured 2-3 of their own brews as well as a multitude of local Cleveland and Ohio beers.

I will definitely be returning to Nano Brew to enjoy another cold drink this summer!"}
{"text":"We finally went to nano brew for food. Have been several time for drinks. Started with the pretzel. pretzel itself was very good but the dipping sauces, one mustard one cheese, were very average. We ordered taco salad and a spicy burger. Taco salad had lots of meat, comes in a giant shell that was delicious and the spicy ranch dressing was great. Other than those two items it was just a basic taco salad but it was filling, especially for a salad. Spicy burger came with waffle fries which were just run of the mill fries. Bacon on burger was really good, nice and crispy. Overall definitely an above average burger but lacking a wow factor to put it above the rest. Would order it again. 

We ate at the bar and the service was superb. It wasn't very busy but when we've gone for drinks in the past we have experienced speedy drink service even on packed nights. Like the atmosphere, beer selection above average."}
{"text":"I can't say I'd ever want to come back to Nano brew. The music was way too loud. And I'm not even that sensitive to loud music. But when you can't hear a single thing the person sitting across from you is saying, it kind of defeats the purpose of going to a bar and socializing. And there wasn't even a raucous dance floor or anything. Plus the wait staff scoffed at us when we asked if they could perhaps turn it down a teensy bit. Actually, the wait staff was just rude in general and messed up multiple times bringing the correct type of beer to the right person. Bleh. All around mediocre experience. Not going back there."}
{"text":"Cool looking place.... Really nice patio, BUT that is the only good thing I have to say about it. We went for lunch on a Saturday and the place was busy but not packed. We were sat by the hostess and waited ten minutes for someone to take our drink order. We then got our beers and waited another 20-25 minutes to put our food order in. From observing there seemed to only be two servers and two hostesses. The manager served the table next to us but only them, didn't seem to really care about other tables.  We had this time to observe because after we made our food order it took a hour to get our food, mind you we were a table of 2. We never got our water refilled until we stopped someone and asked for water. Finally we get our food dropped off by a busser.  The food was OK, nothing great! My fries were all crumbs and I like to have actual fries when I order them..... Our server never came over to check on us after we got our food. I understand this is the service industry and they may have scheduled enough servers but some maybe did not show. FINE but then stop seating people....put a wait on your tables. The whole time we were there the hostess kept seating tables even though the servers were drowning. Nano brew needs better management. Tables of 5 people that sat after us were served and received their food before us. Not one time did the manager try to make our experience better by offering anything, not even water refills. I may try this place again but only for drinks, nooo food! It wasn't that great. I recommended staying away from this place."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out on the weekends you can walk into the back patio, like a frat party. Great place to people watch and see the finest Ohio City hipsters. Food is reasonable. You can play life size jenga and connect four with Ohio City hipsters."}
{"text":"Nice hostesses, fast service at bar, but meal service was slow and not overly friendly. Food was nothing to write home about. 

On the positive side, the place had a good vibe and nice atmosphere.

Summary: Go for a beer, elsewhere for dinner."}
{"text":"I love nano brew. I live across the street and come here often. They always have a great beer selection including their own beers. The burgers and fries are delicious!

I love nano brew. I live across the street and come here often. They always have a great beer selection including their own beers. The burgers and fries are delicious! 

The inside bar has a great atmosphere an there is an outside bar with lots of picnic tables and a view of downtown!"}
{"text":"This place is really cool. The acid burger is VERY good and their home-brewed beer was really good."}
{"text":"I wish that I could write separate reviews for the food and the service. 

The burgers are out of sight! Nano has inventive and delicious flavor combinations, like my favorite: the PB&J burger with bacon jam and peanut butter. They also serve waffle fries instead of standard boring-cut, soggy fries, which is a nice touch. The Acid Trip burger and Stoner Fries are some of my other favorites.

However, the service was really, truly sub-par. On a Saturday evening (dinner time) during the World Series, and a time where there was not a spare seat in the house, the bartender was doing double duty as our server and resident drink slinger. The under-staffing caused us an annoying wait time. This isn't the first time this has happened.

Overall, great food, but they need to do a better job with their weekend staffing. No one likes to wait."}
{"text":"Went for the first time June 2013 for a friend's birthday.  No food, just beers for us.  I tried one of the house brews, a Cluster Bomb.  It was a really good IPA, loaded with hops which I am starting to enjoy.  The place wasn't all that crowded even when we were leaving at 10 pm, but then again it was a Tuesday night.

I really liked the \"adult sized\" Jenga set they have for the patio area.  By the time it came crashing down it was about the same height as my wife, so maybe 5'8''.  I would definitely go again, I'd like to try a few more of the nano beers they've got."}
{"text":"Honestly the worst service I've ever had. The waiter looked like his name would be Jeremy but he never greeted us so how would we know? Three of us went for a late Sunday brunch and it wasn't busy, yet we waited for what felt like years. It took 15 minutes to even get water. We were hopeful for the food to make up for the b*tchy atmosphere but it didn't. The food was cold and there wasn't even butter for the toast. I'm giving this one star for the one hour of my life that I'll never get back. Pretty decent soft pretzel though. #nanobrew? More like #nanopoo"}
{"text":"My first time here was during Labor Day weekend and I would have to say what a neat place. While I didn't eat anything, and cannot yet speak to the food offering, the draft beer list was intriguing. It's great having a beer that you don't see on draft at most places like the \"Boulder Shake\" chocolate porter(5.9% ABV), which was wonderful!  The outside courtyard was impressive with the multi-level layout that featured a covered outdoor bar accented with TV's. The aesthetics inside were equally pleasing. The brew master worked as a live exhibit in a cool little fenced in area next to the bar.  He was actively composing a new seasonal flavor which I understood to be a pumpkin brown ale.  The black metal design inside and out stood out and presented a modern, industrial flair. Plus, nothing suggests staying power like a moose head on the wall! The bartender was friendly and knowledgeable. I visited during off peak early afternoon hours, on a Friday, but I understand the place can be hopping in the evening and late night hours. I definitely want to stop back soon to try some grub and new suds!"}
{"text":"While they have a great selection of beer on tap the service and kitchen has issues.   Ordered the double bacon double burger (from the bar as there were no servers at the time then sat at a nearby hightop). Waited 50 minutes for a burger and fries and there was no bacon on it.  Hard to send a food item back when you are a) starving and b) have no server.  The burger was good however I paid a few bucks more for the bacon, didn't get any, and waited way too long when the place wasn't that crowed (save the bar area)."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was average. I got the hangover fries....they could have been done better. The menu items were creative sounding but execution could be better. Example my dish was hashtag fries, omelette type egg, bacon gravy, cheese sauce and scallions.  It was meh....I think it would have been better to have fried egg and shredded sharp cheddar cheese instead. Bloody Mary was good and spicy!"}
{"text":"This place was empty on St pattys day for a reason. AWFUL SERVICE!  Don't go here. Sucks!"}
{"text":"Seriously at the point where i could not believe how my boyfriend and i were treated. He has never been to Nano Brew before... with that being said i told him the burgers were awesome. When we walked in we stood there for about 5-6 minutes with others and since no one ever came over we sat ourselves after we witnessed the other people do so. ( i did look for a seat yourself sign, etc. ) but nobody came to the hostess stand. Anyway, we waited to be greeted at our table for about 10 Minutes. Clearly our server saw us sitting/ waiting and she got the table who sat after us there beers and waters... then we were greeted. She looked at us and said : What can i get you? are you ready to order? Like upset she had to serve us. After we ordered our drinks, burgers. He pointed out first that we were treated like crap, i had to reassure him this chick is not happy to be working today. i mean i could hear her chewing her gum from across the bar. Someone else had to get him another beer because she was not coming to our table. I had to laugh about our experience because i didn't want this to ruin our Sunday afternoon. Our burgers came out, I opened the bun to put mayo on it... which i never do and there was MOLD on my bun. Good thing i ordered mayo or else i would have still ate it. I understand things happen, but for the cook to not check the bread i was surprised. so we waited another ten minutes for her to come up to ask how our meal was. ( because i wasn't going to go look for her, thats not my job. ) She could careless mold was on my bun, and said we will get you a new one. . . So i mean i expected that. And i was super nice about it! i understand and i know it wasn't her fault. So we waited about 15 minutes for the new one. Probably two minutes after a different server brought me the burger, she came up and slammed the check on the table. Didn't ask how the food was, i mean my boyfriend WAS going to have another drink but why even bother. We go out often and it sucked we had such a terrible time. I actually wanted something different than market, or Downhill and we were treated like dirt on shoes. Maybe people have bad days but leave that outside your job. I am a server myself and i treat my guests as how i would want to be treated. I mean maybe she didn't know i was a server, i usually tip 35 %. When she slammed the check down it was $24. something so i left $25 and said we are set. She asked what was wrong and i explained everything in a kindly matter what i am writing in this review. I told her i couldn't believe the way you treated us, and to still charge me for the mold burger. I am not really asking for a free meal. It's a simple thing. When you have mold on a bun you don't charge the guest for it. i don't care if i had to wait for a new one. but i wanted to just leave i couldn't even speak with her any longer. i did tell her try smiling it may help. God for bid the place i work at if there were ever MOLD on the bun the entire check would be comped maybe even with a damn drink. But Chloe B didn't care. Doesn't like her job, its clear. & She was like this at other tables. Her excuse was \" well we all take each others tables\"... Nice excuse! I could laugh as i am typing this. And i had to write a yelp review because nobody has returned my voice mails! Thanks NANO! i love your drinks and food. but i will probably never be back, if so ill get take out. (And for those reading this since she never told us her name, luckily i got it off the check) Happy Sunday, hopefully those who attend today have a better experience."}
{"text":"This is slowly turning in to one of my favorite happy hour spots in Ohio City.  A group of us checked this place out when it was new and fresh.  My first impressions were: the old Garage Bar space looks grown up and hip now and WOW - that's a lot of beer.  The unfortunate part was that we got there when things were really heating up so the place was PACKED.  Didn't really skew my first impression as a bad one - just had some reservations because the service couldn't really keep up with the demand.  

Well, boy - things have changed since that early day and I can't seem to stay away from this place!  Grab a couple friends, plop down at one of the tables on the side (the back patio is great, too), and dig in to the extensive beer/drink menu.  There's a beer for everyone - stouts, IPAs, Belgian Wheats - you name it, they have it (if you're reading this and Nano still has it, do yourself a favor and try the Fat Heads Bumbleberry.  You're welcome).  

Food is great too - it's bar food with a serious kick.  It's part of the Market Garden/Bier Market/Bar Cento group, so expect the goods.  Stoner fries are amazing (I'll let you process that for a second), Mac & Cheese bites are pure amaze-balls, and the bf tried the PBJ Burger (yes, it's exactly what you would expect and more - peanut butter, BACON (the surprise factor), and jam all piled high on that juicy burger) and he said it was delicious.

So when Market Garden is a little too packed or you're looking for a more low key, super chill vibe, venture down 25th a little and you'll run yourself smack-dab into Nano.  You get it all - beer, food, and patio all wrapped up in one amazing place."}
{"text":"Typically stop in whenever we head to WSM.  Always has been a good time.  They have a good beer selection, both their own brews and other craft beers.  Haven't had a full meal here yet, only snacks, but looking forward to trying their full menu.  The staff has always been friendly and the service quick.  Will continue to stop in on our visits to WSM."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and really enjoy the beer selection, but the food here has really gone downhill.  And, I don't understand why, except quality control is just not an issue any more.  Yesterday, I ordered a regular burger, and got a well-done, pancake-sized patty.  It was fast-food quality.  I remember a time not long ago when they had some of the best burgers in the area.    

I could give the same review to Bar Cento (same owners) down the block.  I feel like they started something awesome, then just let it fizzle on the back burner while moving on to new projects.  

I hope they get their standards back to where they used to be.  I really want to enjoy these great places again."}
{"text":"Was there earlier in the summer on a Saturday afternoon and then again this past labor day weekend.   Neither day was extremely busy, but a few more people on labor day.   The first time, the service was fine.   Labor Day weekend however, was awful.   Went to the outside bar, and never got acknowledged by the 3 people behind the bar.   Went inside, one bartender stared at us and walked right by.  He didn't say \"I'll be right with you\" or anything.   2 other bartenders just standing there, again not acknowledging us.   We were just about to walk out after 10 minutes of trying to get a drink when one of the women behind the bar finally decided to ask us if we needed something.   Disappointing as the beer selection is great, but not sure its worth dealing with the awful service.   Its no wonder that all the other bars in Ohio City were packed and this one was not."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon. Went with the special pizza bagel burger which was awesome. Fries were good and so was my beer. 

Service was also very good. I ate inside. It was clean, didn't smell funny like some bars do, and the bathrooms were nice and clean. 

Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"The Wake and Bake burger was phenomenal. If you're a fan of breakfast food you'll love this. If you're hungry get the double patty."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, there's a giant moose on the wall, lots of space, high top tables, big front windows. I really liked the interior of this place. I went on a Sunday and it wasn't too busy at all. 

The pretzel appetizer is amazing. Homemade dough that's so chewy on the inside and perfect on the outside. I like how they served two types of sauces with it, mustard and nacho type cheese. 

I got the \"Acid Trip\" burger, it was delicious and the reduced balsamic gave the burger a unique flavor. I also love coleslaw so that combo was perfect. The burger was smaller than I expected.. But that ended up being a good thing because it was perfect size. The fries weren't the best but they weren't bad either. 

I sat down at a table and it took a waiter 20 minutes to come and say hello, in fact, the waiter got the people waters who sat down after and next to us before he greeted us. The whole rest of the time the staff barely paid attention to us. We had to go up to the bar to ask for our check because we were waiting so long for the waiter to come ask us if we were ready for the check or how our food was. The service was a buzz kill to the good food."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I love Nano Brew and that this is only a single experience that was negative. I was enjoying trivia with my friends and ordered the veggie bowl as a snack. It was much bigger than expected and I turned out to not be that hungry so I took a few bites of it and then set it aside to be boxed and taken home. Service was a bit slow with the crowds of people so I turned to answer the next trivia question. When I turned back to my plate - it had been cleared. I asked the guy in charge and he had found out that it was cleared because my napkin was placed over it (something the bar back said. I didn't put my napkin on it, but who knows maybe it was laying near it). Because I had taken a few bites of it, they refused to discount the meal and made me pay for the full dish. The customer service was terrible and the reason the bar manager gave was \"I know the bar back and trust him and I don't know you\". So incredibly disappointed - he offered nothing in return for throwing away my meal. I'm sure I'll be back, but I don't recommend eating at the bar or maybe just stick to beers since I haven't had those tossed out on me yet!"}
{"text":"Went here on Thursday one week after they opened after leaving a horrible experience at the Old Angle Tavern.  Even though I was in a sour mood, the energy of the bar, friendly managers and wait staff, along with some of the most delicious beer varieties in the area soon had a smile on my face.  The Southern Tier Pumpking was the best pumpkin beer I have tasted thus far.  Everyone working looked happy to be at work and socialize with all the new customers.  Next time I go, I will definitely be eating there (which is why I gave 4/5 stars for now).  I can't wait to try the falafel, which I was told can be substituted for any of the burgers for any vegetarians out there! Their own IPA, Nano Incognito was DELICIOUS..great prices too!  It is nice to be able to buy a nice beer, yet if your pockets are a little light they offer $2 PBR tall boys...not bad!!! I was also told if you ride your bicycle there, PBR's are only $1! I will be back soon Nano!"}
{"text":"My wife and I used to love to come here back when it was The Garage, and we were we even excited when we saw that they had expanded into three total storefronts!  Yay!

But, wait.  It obviously wasn't due to a home-grown grass-roots business doing well.  Some company came in and obviously renovated the place into a pretentious and sterile restaurant bar - which is a far cry from it's original spirit.

No smoking outside?  Seriously?  Then, never mind.  I'll go to The Old Angle across the street."}
{"text":"We have tried time and time again to like Nano Brew, but the staff simply detracts so strongly from the experience that we will never go back.  

Nano was once a favorite spot of ours to grab a burger and a good brew.  However, after multiple encounters with some of the most severely rude and slow service I have ever encountered we are finally saying no more.  

Unfortunately, it seems to have become common place for Nano to hire staff that finds it acceptable to ignore customers, speak in condescending tones, and generally act as though your presence is a burden.  This attitude in combination with the kitchen's general inability to provide food in a timely manner (i.e., less than an hour) is simply unacceptable.

While the concept of Nano Brew is great, especially on the rare occasion when accompanied by good service, we will never go back.  

Thanks for the few good memories, but you can keep the rude service and hour long waits."}
{"text":"Ahhh. Well. 
My boyfriend and I went in with big expectations. We saw the beer list and menu and it seemed great. 
Well, the beer ended up being the only redeeming quality. 
After ordering drinks we asked for a few minutes to look over the menu... No one returned for around 20 minutes. 
We ordered fried pickles for an app but were told a few minutes later they were out of them... Forgivable. We ordered Mac and cheese bites instead-- incredibly bland... Not very cheesy and 0 flavor. For my meal, I ordered the wedge salad... Listed as being served with pork belly and pickled red onions. Well... It came out (45 minutes after we ordered...on a slowish Sunday night) with what appeared to be crumbled bacon bits.
I asked the server and she said \"oh. Sorry. It's bacon today and not pork belly\" and immediately walked away. Would have been nice to know before ordering. Also, the pickled red onion was just fried onion straw things. Salad had no substance. My boyfriend ordered the fun guy burger and even though they didn't ask how he wanted the burger done it came scorched a charred. From what he said it was also very dry and very flavorless. There was supposed to be some crazy kind of mushroom on it too but it really only had about 6 what looked
Like regular old sautéed mushrooms. The service was horrendous. We ended up having to walk over to the bar to even get someone to give us the check. No bueno.  Despite the good beer we won't be back. The menu seems to be regular old food disguised as if it's part of this new \"gastro pub\" movement. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Excellent bartender, fun crowd, my favorite beer on tap.....disappointed in my burger.  Where's the beef?  For $9, I expected a patty that filled the bun.  Excellent flavor, cooked to perfection, just tiny.  Come on Nano, get it together!"}
{"text":"I have to admit that since their expansion into the old Black Pig location I thoroughly enjoy this much more than before. I always have loved their back patio in the summer but now that there is much more space inside I find Nano to be much more enjoyable. I think the extra windows really brightens the place up!

On my latest visit I sat next to a regular who told me that I HAD to order the Acid  Trip Burger as it is his favorite and most beloved burger on the menu. So I did. I thought the burger was great! A burger is always great when they cook it the way you ordered it (medium for me). I appreciate the beer menu here as well because of the good variety. Some places have too many of one kind of beer (IPA, Stout, etc...).

Next time I visit I was told I need to try the Everything Pretzel and I would love to try Nano's rendetion of the KFC Mashed Potato bowl!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with the family last Saturday. The patio is nice - a little crowded, but still nice. I liked the background music a lot and it wasn't too loud to have a conversation.I ordered a classic burger and was not disappointed. It was done perfectly and tasted great. Add to that they serve Griffin original cider and you have a winner. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday afternoon and split the pretzel and fries. The pretzel was buttery and salty with mustard and thick cheese dip. The fries came with three different sauces to dip, the spicy mayo was my favorite. I ordered a huge wheat ale that went great with the spicy burger. Definitely recommend this place if you're craving a good burger and a beer."}
{"text":"Didn't know much about Nano Brewery, but it was only a 2 min walk from Great Lakes. It is new, clean, and basically a long rectangular bar.  Long bar, bunch of tables, small bar menu, and a bunch of seating in the back patio area with an additional bar. It is a fun place with a decent beer menu...it includes a few of their own and then a bunch of guest beers.
-All I really tried in terms of beer was the Cluster Bomb IPA, it wasn't bad. Didn't blow me away but this place is just a fun place to hang out.
-They had giant Jenga which I thought was great.
-This place is a minute from Great Lakes and Market Garden so why not stop in? Worth it! As for merch, they really just had glasses and I believe tshirts."}
{"text":"This place has already experienced quite an evolution already, if you ask me, and a positive one at that. I think the 5th star will be granted when I finally get service with a smile...

I really like this space. I liked garage bar for the patio and I sometimes reminisce about the PBRs that were enjoyed there, but I think Nano Brew is a great addition to the area. I've only ever had a burger and a hot dog here. The burger was juicy and delicious and the hot dog...oh boy the hot dog. If you know me, I'm a sucker for hot dogs. The menu described the \"Soggy Dog\" as having chili, cheese and jalepeno sour cream with chips. I was SO excited...then I got the dog. WITH THE CHIPS ON IT. Then, I was SHOCKED AND ELATED. The chips were delicious and the soggy dog was definitely soggy and amazing. Such a good mass of flavors and textures! I couldn't finish it, but I have a goal to try again and succeed! 

The only problem with this place is the service. Every time I've ever been here, no one has smiled. Not one smile. The staff is either very unhappy about their work environment or they just hire unhappy people here. I feel like the vibe from behind the bar brings the whole atmosphere down a couple of notches. If the staff would just HAVE.SOME.FUN, I think the everyone would perk up a bit."}
{"text":"Bartenders were extremely helpful and friendly, and the beer list was massive. We stopped in for a bit while on vacation and I actually had two flights. None of their beers disappointed at all. I absolutely would come back here again if the chance came up!

Only reason I didn't give it a five was because we didn't get to try the food. Everything else though, the beer, the location, the decor, was a five all the way. If we ever get back here and try the food (and it's good) I'll gladly update this to a five!"}
{"text":"I first fell in love with Nano when I tried their Peanut Butter & Jelly Burger a while back. With a great selection of beer and burgers this place was a favorite of mine and I was excited for their expansion. The new patio is stunning and made for a great gathering spot for weeknight drinks but if you are planning on going on a weekend forget about it. 

A few friends and I stopped in for food on a Saturday afternoon just a few weeks back and were met with some of the slowest and unhelpful service I have encountered in a while. We ordered 2 appetizers and entree among the 4 of us and it took us over and hour to get the first appetizer. With only one of our 2 apps we were looking to our server for answers and he was hard to get a hold of.  Once our second app made it to us we were informed ours was sent to the wrong table. Tracking down our waiter to pay our bill was even more of hassle we had the tables surrounding us working to flag him down for us as well.

Trying not to discount the experience we returned again last weekend and ordered food from the bar it still came out in segments. 

I really want to fall back in love with Nano, but recent experiences lend me to believe that the service can't keep up with the shinny new space."}
{"text":"Loved it. Awesome atmosphere and great food. I had a burger and my wife had an order of chicken sliders and Stoner Fries.  I love Ohio City to begin with but this is another reason to go."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible experience & walked out when we didn't receive food after about two hours. The waitress was unfriendly and unresponsive. I left hungry, sober and upset. No stars if Yelp let me."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed in this place, I really liked coming here (good beer selection, nice atmosphere) but last time I was here they double-charged my credit card.  Because of how they handled it, I won't be back.   I called them the next business day and talked to a manager, and he treated me like some drunk idiot that forgot what she spent.  He said he'd \"check into it\" and call me back and never did.  I gave them 2 business days to return my call, when they did not, I filed a dispute with my bank.  Had he checked, he would have seen that I signed the receipt for the correct amount (which I have a copy of) and the 2nd charge has no signature (because they ran it after I left-our servers switched halfway through, I told the 2nd server to combine the 2 tabs, which she did, and I paid.  They then ran the first tab again later in the night).
Simple mistake, but because of how they handled it (or really, didn't) I won't be returning. There are plenty of other options to choose from!  Check your credit card statements!"}
{"text":"Wanted to add in my feelings on the brunch here. Haven't been here for brunch in quite a while, not sure why as the food is delectable. As always here, outstanding beer selection. For food, I had the Brunch Burger, cheddar, bacon, gravy, and a sunny side up egg on a pancake which was outstanding. I was hoping this would be like a handheld burger with pancakes as the buns, however I was still extremely pleased with this \"open-faced burger.\" My fiance had the steak and eggs, on top of some tots which was delicious.
Lots of good places to get brunch, but I can't imagine that it will take us as long to return here for brunch again."}
{"text":"So thanks to all my Cleveland Yelpers for recommending this place to try on my last business trip to Cleveland. Co-worker of mine stopped by on a late Saturday night to have a couple beers. The place was completely slammed and with upwards of 90% women. I'm not sure if the ratio of men:women in Cleveland is in favor of the fairer sex or if we were just there on ladies. We're both married men so my review isn't based on that fact. :)

I was really impressed with the selection of local IPAs. Many of them I had never heard of before and it was quite a treat to try new beers that didn't have \"Great Lakes\" in the name. I gotta say, Cleveland is finally catching up to the beer scene and Nano Brew will be at the top of list while in DT Cleveland."}
{"text":"Best Slaw Dogs ever, this place is definately up there with one of the best bar/late night foods,"}
{"text":"My husband and I were here for my birthday and had some awesome food. The burgers were cooked to perfection.  They were juicy and delicious.  It was a bit busy, but worth the wait. Prices were reasonable.  Will definitely return on our date night out."}
{"text":"Nano is a cool place. It's definitely one of my Ohio City stops during a bar run. It's got a good selection of brews, good food, and the outdoor patio bar is a summertime hit. Nano Brew was a blast this past summer. And you never seem to have a problem finding a seat.

About the important stuff: Food. I really enjoy and recommend the Acid Trip burger. It's practically a mini Lola burger without the egg. The macro fries or stoner fries is a solid choice. Waffle style fries with chili, ghetto nacho cheese, sour cream... like nachos. And... 

[drumroll please]

Fried Oreos ! It's pretty epic. You get three, but I learned the hard way that you can also order Mitchell's vanilla ice-cream on the side AND when you put them together à la mode, it's Perfect !!"}
{"text":"Super chill place- great to hang out and watch some sports and grab a drink. Apparently waffle fries are off the hook ...

Tuesday night Trivia is fun and brings a good crowd. Excellent beers and I really love the atmosphere. 

DISCLAIMER: not Vegan friendly at all
They claim a V for vegan on the menu but it only refers to salads that barely have any fresh vegetables on them. The Baby Kale salad I requested was not as written on the menu.

My friends who don't have any dietary restrictions were satisfied but not wowed.

The service was 100% kind- they aimed to please and rectify my very dismal salad but unfortunately they didn't have the inventory of vegetables."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and both times we had awful service!  It's a shame too because the beer and food here are great.  The first time we came it was pretty late at night on a weekend.  We were bar hopping around Ohio City and I heard Nano had some good late night munchies.  After waiting 20 min for a table we waited another 30 mins for a server to help us.  I ordered a beer flight and stoner fries which seems like a pretty simple order right?  Guess not because that ended up taking another 45 minutes!  It wasn't even that busy so I don't understand why everything took forever.  The beer was tasty and the fries were awesome, but the service ruined my experience here that night.
This past Sunday we were bar hopping around Ohio City again, and I decided to give Nano another try.  I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt from my last experience because I know it was late at night and sometimes service is just off, so why not?  Well it happened again!  This time we went out back to the outdoor bar.  We sat there for 15 min and the bartender never said a word to us.  I tried waving her down several times and she ignored me.  She wasn't that busy so I don't understand why she was ignoring us?  My husband started getting frustrated and wanted to leave, but I convinced him to move to the bar inside and maybe we will have better luck.  It was slightly better inside but not much.  Bartender took 10 min to acknowledge us when we were seated right in front of him!  He was also pretty rude and acted like we were a inconvenience.  I was getting hangry and needed a snack or else I would have just left at this point.  I ordered a beer and some tots which were both good, but again the service ruined my experience!  Unless Nano fixes the service here I probably won't be coming back.  Ohio City has plenty of other bars walking distance with way better service!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and house made microbrewery.  Decent burgers, but avoid the chicken thigh entree (gives new meaning to tiny) and blackeyed peas baked beans (mealy and tasteless).  My buddy swears by the PB&J burger.  Barkeeps are more than friendly and accommodating, especially ALEX.  Outdoor spaces are wonderful, but I do wish they hadn't removed The Garage's beautiful fire pit."}
{"text":"Only been here once, so this review is kinda incomplete. Smallish inside but plenty of room at the bar. Burger was really good and service was decent. Had a Citramax and it was better than anything I have had from MGB. Great selection of guest beer. Would come here every time over the brewery next door."}
{"text":"Limited food menu, good beer selection, good service not too loud. Festive."}
{"text":"This is a nice change from the other places down the street. While still a young crowd, it doesn't make you feel like you are back in college. The patio is great and there is a lot of seating outside which is perfect to enjoy one of Cleveland's beautiful summer nights. They have a ton of craft beers (as their name suggests) and the service is good. 

They even have giant jenga which was a blast to play. I would totally recommend a round while hanging out (beer in hand of course). Overall a great spot for some drinks."}
{"text":"Really cool place. Only drank and their beer gets a thumbs up! We went in the middle of the day and didnt wait for a seat inside which was great! Unfortunately I didn't eat while here  but their pork sliders with slaw sounded great. I also want to try the spicy burger and the stoner fries. How could something called Stoner fries be bad? They have chorizo on them...come on!? It's a cool atmosphere with mostly 20 and 30 somethings. I loved the giant Jenga game as well!"}
{"text":"Had previously been to Nano Brew for a book club meeting. Food and drinks were good, service was okay. It was loud and not an ideal book club venue, but we had fun. 
Went back this weekend for a little drink and nosh after the Cleveland Flea. It was just after 3:30pm and the hostess refused to seat us because we weren't going to eat a full meal. \"We're starting to sway for dinner. Try the bar.\" AT 3:30 ON A SATURDAY! Well, the bar was packed and we called bullshit. We headed to Market Garden where the hot pretzels weren't as good but at least they sat us right away and the service was great."}
{"text":"Beer is good services is absolutely horrible. Waited over 30 min for someone to talk to us. Will not be coming back"}
{"text":"I sat at the bar. Bartender came right up to me and asked what I wanted. Being that I have never been here I needed a second to take a look. After a couple we contacts later the bartender came back. I ordered and asked for food menu. 20 minutes later I'm sitting here and no one comes back. A couple sits next to me and is also irritated no one is helping them. I related to the couple that I've been waiting too. Finally a woman bartender comes over to the couple (who sat down way after me) to ask if they need anything. Completely ignoring me! I had to get her attention. Told her I've been waiting for a bit. She didn't even bat an eyelash just cashed me out for my beer. Two stars for good beer and none for customer service. I'm bummed."}
{"text":"Good combination of beer and food. 

The beer list is pretty extensive and there is probably something for every kind of beer drinker. If not, there is a full service bar so you won't feel completely lame for not drinking a beer at a place called Nano Brew. As far as I can tell, the list changes fairly frequently, so you won't get bored choosing the same few brews on repeat. 

A few friends and I split the fried pickles and the Mac and cheese bites. I was really impressed with both. Fried pickles can be really hit or miss, but Nano Brew did a great job! The Mac and Cheese bites were my favorite thing I had. I mean, deep fried mac and cheese goes so perfectly with a beer, how can someone complain? The dipping sauce was great with them as well. 

The price range is typical for Ohio City. You can get a couple beers and an appetizer for around $20, which is extremely fair I think. If you get a few minutes to spare, you can also play giant jenga, and how can you not want to do that?!"}
{"text":"So, we are here on a Sunday night. Almost empty location. 
The night took a turn when a client insulted the bartender Angie .she took care of it, with her of another staff, kudos to both,  as we were able to enjoy the night duche free! 
Oh yeah, and they have a nice select of beers."}
{"text":"The food was good. Great location on 25th st. In Ohio city. Went on a night that was kinda slow. The food came out fast!"}
{"text":"Awful food, awful service.  Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.  It amazes me how some people in the service industry think that being rude and dismissive is ok.  If your food is going to be this bad, at least serve it with a smile."}
{"text":"Just arrived on a not so busy Friday night. Sitting at a table across from the bar. Ordered our beers. Saw the bartender pour them, mine was a bit foamy. Then saw her drink from my beer to get the foam down. She did this 3 times, then gave my beer to waitress to serve to me. YUCK!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of beer and they have several good ones. Friendly bartenders, decently priced place. Menu is a typical bar menu, but a bit better. Didn't eat, but just about everything is under 10 bucks."}
{"text":"Food was great. The menue that was handed to me looked and felt like a movie theater floor after a movie let out. It almost made me not want to eat here. After I washed my hands and hot my food it was excellent. The service was ok the bar tender was not the friendliest person in the world. Other than that it was a pretty cool place"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a handful of times and every time the service has been absolutely terrible, they are constantly out of various drinks and everyone who works there has an attitude.

Last night's experience took the cake, we were there for a World Series game and they absolutely handled everything incorrectly. We had a table and were informed that it was a \"self serve\" bar because it was going to get loud. I've been to many bars that can accomplish having servers during busy times. In addition to crowing people sitting at the bar to get drinks, the bartenders legit ignore you. I had two servers straight up ignore me and the people around me were also shocked. 

I finally ordered two drinks and some food. A few minutes later joe came to my table with one beer and goes \"we were out of the cider\" and walks away. I said \"well can I order something else\" AND WALKS AWAY. My boyfriend is pissed because joe was so rude. I eventually got another drink but joe is a shrew little pipsqueak and should be fired.

Everyone who works here is a hipster who thinks they are better than the patrons. Reminder: you work in a bar."}
{"text":"Garbage,  waited like 2 hrs for food wasn't even right when it came.   Grilled cheese was Texas toast on one American single.   Would not come back would not get again. Place looks nice but food is subpar,  better off getting fast food and coming here for beer"}
{"text":"Great place to brunch and watch the game. 
The bartenders are super friendly and give great beer suggestions (they have a bunch of different companies not just their own). 
Their beer burger is out of this world! I would highly recommend it. It comes with a side of waffle fries (next time I'm going to ask for these extra crispy). 
Will be back for that burger for sure!"}
{"text":"My meal was pretty average. I ordered their cheesesteak. The cheesesteak was chopped up beef and what tasted like nacho cheese on top of it. And it was a pretty small cheesesteak. Their waffle fries also tasted like chick fil a's waffle fries. Their moscato was good but you can get good moscato at other places too. I guess only come here for the beer. They have a wide selection hence the name. The atmosphere was chill too. And the bar tenders were friendly. But there are more satisfying places around Ohio to get a meal."}
{"text":"If you like sitting at a table and being ignored, then this is the place for you! They only serve who they want to serve. So I will serve them with a one star review."}
{"text":"Reasonable drink prices aligned with all the other bars on W25th. They have a great selection of drafts and change up their offerings often. The bar is very cozy and cool, and usually a lot less crowded then some of its neighbors, which I think is a good thing. The staff is always very friendly and attentive. I usually order a flight of beers, which gives me a sampling of four beers, before deciding on what to drink. Nano is definitely a go to spot for me when I'm in Ohio City."}
{"text":"We come here to watch Michigan football games (woo! go blue!) and when we come, we usually grab some bar food.

They have a solid veggie burger option - a black bean burger that you can substitute in any of the burgers. The best one is the \"Spicy\" burger. I'm not that big of a fan of the \"Hoppin John\", which is the actual veggie burger mostly because I felt there wasn't enough flavor from the toppings.

The other bar food is pretty standard, though better than average. One of my favorites is the fried mac and cheese bites (heart attack) and any of their fries. 

The have a really solid draught list!! They brew their own beer at Nano, and its pretty similar to its big brother, Market Garden. Not bad for their own brews, but also not my favorite. 

Overall, it's an enjoyable experience. The decor is cool - they have the red brick with vintage bicycles for decor. They also have a big jenga set near the back patio, making it a fun place to be! It's not as crowded as Market Garden, and it's a chill place to go for games."}
{"text":"This place has a cool feel to it, the people are friendly, but the service is slow if you sit at a table. We told the server we needed a minute to look at the menu and he didn't come back for 30 minutes and it wasn't busy at all."}
{"text":"A group of us stopped in to check out their burgers, after being featured in the Cleveland Magazine.  The place was pretty empty when we went on a Friday afternoon, and service was decent but not particularly friendly nor helpful when trying to decide on a beer.   

The bar itself is clean and comfortable, with all seating at the bar or high top tables. The beer menu was sufficient, but for a place with \"Brew\" in the name, not impressive. Guess that's the \"nano\" part of the brews. They were out of one of the house beers.

Six of us at the table ordered burgers, and we all agreed on one thing: It would have been a great burger if there had been more of it.  If you're looking for the burger that they printed in the Cleveland Magazine, you won't find it without looking well into your bun and under the toppings.  

I had the Wake and Bake burger, with a fried egg and bacon on an English Muffin bun. The egg was perfectly cooked, the bacon, delicious, the bun was wonderful and I'm an English Muffin fan, but the burger, approximately 2/3 size of the bun, was small, rounded and overcooked for medium rare.   It came with a side of waffle fries which numbered about 4 or 5.  Other friends had the Acid trip, which they agreed was good but meager on the meat.

Overall it was a decent experience, and if a friend wanted to meet there, I would go again, but the experience didn't leave me with a desire to return any time soon."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere. The fries were tasty but my sandwich was downright disgusting. I had a pulled pork and it tasted like a mouth full of salt. The staff was nice though!"}
{"text":"first time here. decided on the place due to location in ohio city.
We were not that hungry, so we only got a nano brew and two appetizers.

Beer: Nano Tandem Cruiser Lemon Radler. It was a light beer. I could taste the lemon.  It was a warm, sunny day, appropriate for the day.

Chicken Nannugets: They were beer battered chicken nuggets. The hot honey mustard was strong at times, it somehow really hit my sinuses. I liked the Mumbo sauce, sort of like a sweet and sour.

Nano Sliders: They were above par. Would I get them again? Probably not, but they were good.

Overall Impression: 
The decor of the place, the deck, was really nice. They sate me and my gf the furthest seat from the entrance, we were wondering if we would even get waters. They eventually came and things went smoothly from there.  I think I would try this place out again, especially with the decor and outdoors-y deck look, but the food was about par for me."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to have dinner before a show at Playhouse Square.  Yes, I know that this isn't in the area but we've pretty much tried all the spots within walking distance of Playhouse Square (especially on such a cold, cold night!) and we don't like to pay twice for parking so the restaurants on West 25th with their ample free parking fit the bill.  We hadn't been to Nano Brew yet and, with a couple of beer drinkers in our group, it seemed like the perfect fit!  The staff was very friendly when we entered and we found a nice table in the relatively small space.  There is a huge selection of beer (not surprisingly!) and a nice menu of apps, sandwiches, and burgers.  I had a falafel wrap with waffle fries and it was delicious!  Everyone else enjoyed their burgers and the prices are just right.  We'll definitely stop back!"}
{"text":"Very good patio and beer list. Burger was extremely small (about half the area of the bun) and extremely salty. Ate only two of the available four bites. Fries were good. As a bar, four stars; as a restaurant, one and a half stars."}
{"text":"Moved back to the Cleveland area a few months ago. I've been using yelp like crazy, catching up on all the places that have popped up in the last few years since I've lived in town, figured it was time to finally make an account.  Stopped in at Nano Brew Saturday night for beers on a friend's recommendation.  Didn't eat (though the burgers came pretty highly recommended), but the draft list was pretty on point! I was pumped they had the current Stone Enjoy By on tap, as well as some local selections.  The Market Garden stout was pretty good too.  The bartender's weren't the most talkative, but we certainly didn't wait for service. I'll definitely swing back here soon to try the food."}
{"text":"great beer selection. awesome patio for a
nice day out. attentive waiters/waitresses. will be back to try the food"}
{"text":"Nano  brew! What a great place really! I love the layout, it's like going into different parts of an old warehouse building  of sorts with the beams still in place.

Ok let's start with the beer. Great selection of craft brews from all over the country as well as in house made. If your a fan of craft beer, you'll certainly  find something here you like.

Food, awesome! Very unique menu for sure! I tried the acid burger which ironically enough was voted clevelands most unique burger. Let me say when it arrives and I tasted it, what a flavor explosion and the tasty coleslaw as a topper....YUM! I order the smaller version as basically a lunch/snack and the next time I'd certainly  order the full one for sure!

I'll definitely be back here for sure! Great brews,cool place, awesome food!"}
{"text":"Any mixed drink barely had any liquor in it. Food was sub par, mainly frozen fried food. They somehow managed to burn our pretzel as an appetizer. Also, they forgot to place my dinner order. It came out 30-60 minutes after everyone else at my table and still charged me for it. I confronted the bartender about it, he could not understand why I was upset, and never got the manager for me to talk to. Not highly recommended."}
{"text":"Here is my BIGGEST beef with Nano- messed up credit card charges.  If you go, use cash.  This is the second time my credit card has been charged with additional weird amounts.  For instance, my actual bill cleared, and I have a pending $16.00 charge for no reason hanging out there, and it's been like that since Sunday.  I called last time this happened a few times, I was told a manager would call me back and never did.  The charge ended up going away, so I let it go.  If you use your debit card this is even more frustrating because the pending charge puts a hold on the amount.  Please Nano.  We enjoy stopping in for beers when we hit the West Side Market.  PLEASE get a new POS system!!!!!"}
{"text":"Bike friendly is a major plus! I ride my bike and like it to be welcome along with me. I've heard there is going to be some single barrel brews popping up as experiments. Would be interested in trying those. The brew list is good. Still feels a bit like garage bar but minimalistic and clean like Cami says. I like the new look and feel. Burger was ok too. Nothing to write home about. Came out super quick."}
{"text":"Went as they were on a list for top falafel places in Cleveland. The item was more of a hummus wrap with tiny pieces of mushy falafel thrown in for good measure.  Patio was pretty but #hipsterheaven. I missed the sign that said you must have workout clothes or a man-bun to enter."}
{"text":"Rude hipsters with a bar that's filthy. Out of a lot of beers. We are finishing our one drink and leaving.
Not to mention our server ignored us until the end (and basically threw our check at us)
So disappointing. Not going back.
I have worked in restaurant/bars and was raised by a single mom who was a server at a local restaurant for 30 yrs.
These guys have no clue."}
{"text":"Nano Brew is okay. 

Much better than the Garage, IMHO. But the clientele left something to be desired. There were just swarms of rude brahs there. Not the fault of Nano Brew, obviously, but ugh. I'd rather go to Bier Markt/Bar Cento if I wanted to deal with douches. 

I was under the impression that they had more than just a few house brews. On my visit, they had 2. I tried both. They were passable. Apparently, they're doing a few small batches of micros at a time? I'm interested to try more. 

I didn't try any food on this visit. Maybe next time? 

The staff were pretty friendly and paid attention to us. Maybe because my tits were popping out."}
{"text":"Every time I come here the staff in inconsistent, sometimes they do a good job sometimes they are awful, I honestly think they just hire any Joe Shmoe off the street. In particular the girl brunette bartender that has a nose piercing is consistently unpleasant. Does she hate her job? Doesn't take much to smile and be nice to people. Place has a cool patio and a lot of potential but the staff ruins it."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and the best fried pickles I've ever had! I love their patio, too--one of the best in the city."}
{"text":"really dug nano, it gave me a familiar feeling and reminded me of that proverbial neighborhood bar. great beer selections, even though limited, they are well thought out. outdoor patio is a modest retreat and doesn't impart trendiness, just comfort and a good time"}
{"text":"Terrible Service, If you like beer then sure this place might be ok but the food is another story. chicken sandwich was like $1 sandwich from the drive thru salad was good wouldn't recommend for food  or ever return. plenty of fruit flies for everyone. bathroom smelled like ass.  what else can I say. its a bar with crappy food and crappy service."}
{"text":"I visited nano brew on a Friday night with several friends. 

First of all, their space is gorgeous. They're located right next to the west side market, which is one of my favorite areas of Cleveland.

I didn't try any cocktails, but I did have a beer, which I thought was delicious, and the staff that served me was helpful and enjoyable to chat with.

Unfortunately, where this establishment lost me was the food. I had the spicy burger with a falafel patty, and it was utterly mediocre: the falafel itself was pretty weak; it reminded me of battered and fried fish without the fish. The burger wasn't really spicy in the slightest. Overall bland on bland, unfortunately. The waffle fries were crunchy but bland.

I will probably return here for more drinks, but I'll avoid the food or order something that looks better-seasoned."}
{"text":"Fun bar with surprisingly lots of space throughout! nice beer selection, although I wish they had some more of their own beers on tap! Also very friendly bar tenders!"}
{"text":"I had only come here to drink before and we planned on eating elsewhere but after looking at the menu everything looked so good we decided to try it. My boyfriend got a burger with chili and peanut butter which was surprisingly good. The tots and waffle fries were delicious nice and crispy. I got a falafel wrap which tasted delicious but I felt it needed lettuce onion and tomatoes... I'm a toppings kinda girl... But they brought me some and it was great! They have a good beer selection from cheap pabst and genesee to their brews to great lakes fat heads and more. Nice patio for the summer too. More than anything I was so impressed by the service. Everyone was so nice and on top of things. I know town hall is popular down the street and their food is good but the service always lacks for me they don't know how to handle a big crowd. This is a nice more relaxed joint down the street with great food and much better service. Plus they have big block jenga!!"}
{"text":"Good beer selection, food was good but I can't give it more than 2 because of the lousy service. Waited for someone to acknowledge me at the bar for a long time (there was one other person there as well, who also couldn't figure out why we were ignored). 

Once I got to order, she demanded that my company all get up and walk inside to show their IDs (even though we had already cleared this with another waitress outside, where we were sitting) and then she a) didn't have half the beers we ordered and b) knew absolutely nothing about the beers. 

For example, I asked for a beer with grapefruit/citrus. \"We don't have it\". \"Ok, do you have a different beer with grapefruit or citrus flavor?\" \"No.\" I looked at the menu, found one with grapefruit and asked \"well do you have this one?\" And she did! So clearly she either had never bothered to read the menu, or she just wanted to be rude."}
{"text":"Nano Brew is in the vibrant Ohio City neighborhood in Cleveland, just across the river from the heart of downtown. They have three different bar areas, with many beers and ciders on tap. My friends and I split the waffle fries appetizer with four side sauces, which went great with our cold afternoon beers. I'll be back to Nano!"}
{"text":"Best burgers we've had in Cleveland. I went with the Spicy burger and my son the Acid Trip. Just incredible .... buns were warm and everything was cooked to perfection. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ohio city is full of awesome summer patios, but Nano Brew is surprisingly the only one with a full bar. Its an awesome place to hang out when the weather is warm, especially because the inside open layout makes it a bit chilly inside.

For brunch, I usually use Nano Brew as my backup option when Town Hall is too busy (& it almost always is). There aren't a ton of great brunch places in OHC so you have to utilize the breweries that serve brunch. I really love their brunch burgers because the patty is very thin which I love! The menu is decently priced at about $8 for a single burger (comes with waffle fries). This location is a pretty solid backup! I wouldn't seek it out for brunch but I have never been disappointed when I eat here."}
{"text":"It's a hipster themed restaurant with frat boy clientele. It is extremely loud compared to the other McNulty offers on W 25th.

This place is dirt cheap but great quality. The burgers are tasty and quick and the waffle fries are the crunchiest (not burned, just crunchy) on the planet. I didn't try the poutine because it wasn't poutine but poutine would have been an awesome appetizer. Portions are small by modern standards but they are actually the right size if you're not trying to move up to the next pant size.

I would sooner go to Bar Cento or Market Garden Brewery but at least this adds an extra option in Ohio City. It's never a bad thing to see more business booming in this stretch of town."}
{"text":"What a cool place. Came here on a brew tour and had a great time trying beers and eating food. Loved the little burgers, reasonably priced. Very chill atmosphere and love the decorations and little touches, best looking patio!!! Beer selection isn't huge of their own beer but good choices otherwise. This is our 2nd time back, will continue to stop in here when in the area!"}
{"text":"Don't know what all the fuss is about about the service here, we sat at the back bar on a Saturday evening and it was fine.

Good selection of brews and a decent twist on traditional bar food. 

My fiance and I both ordered the Taco Tuesday burger which was AMAZING.  I was thoroughly surprised at how good they were.  We wolfed them down along with waffle fries and felt satisfied with the amount of food (not too full but not wishing there was more).  

My buddy got the All day early bird which actually was a pretty neat menu item for someone who isn't wanting a huge meal and wants some breakfast at 7pm.  He enjoyed it and we left after watching the end of the Indians game.  

All three of us had 2 beers a piece and a meal and our check was like 40 bucks and change, so I'd definitely recommend to someone who wants a quick bite and a drink."}
{"text":"Everything was great: food, service and beer. My friend had the PB&J Burger and loved it, I had a less exotic burger with blue cheese and it was delicious. They also had a great beer selection and the service left nothing to be desired. All in all I can definitively recommend going there."}
{"text":"good food: i had the steak & eggs. 

good drinks: good selection of brews

great service.  staff is very attentive and responsive.

went for brunch, stayed throughout the games.

will be back soon to try other options on the menu!"}
{"text":"Nano was about a 3.5 stars. Nothing too special. I got a Nano Namber beer and it was solid. I also got the sliders as my entree and they weren't bad, but nothing to write home about. Solid place to get a beer before the ballgame."}
{"text":"Just ate here and had an awful experience. Of the three of us, one guy liked the beer. 

The service was bad and took forever. When it finally came, they got my order wrong the first time. They replaced it without apology or any customer service effort. The fried chicken sandwich was flavorless. I don't know how you can make fried chicken on a biscuit taste like nothing, but I didn't even finish it. My friend got a burger and the cheese looked awful. He was unimpressed by his food, too, though I won't comment much on things I didn't taste myself."}
{"text":"In his continuing quest to become Lord and Master of Ohio City, Sam McNulty has opened yet another eatery (his 5th) on West 25th St. Like any good subject we decided to sample his latest creation, Nano Brew.

Per our usual MO we headed over to try out Nano Brew for the first time around 7pm on a Monday. We walked in and the place was empty. Actually, there was another guy sitting at the bar but I think he was filling out a job application. We were alone and had the entire place to ourselves. The bartender was friendly, definitely hipster artist, and probably bored to death. We aren't normally ones to enjoy the talkative bartender thing, but he knew how to balance.

I remember Garage Bar and well, it's still basically the Garage Bar. They've cleaned it up a bit to make it less Harley and more Raleigh, but the look is essentially unchanged. There's a nice long, butcher block bar in the front, high tops scattered about and nanobrewing equipment placed center stage smack in the middle of the joint. A nice feel, anyway. The juke was plenty loud playing a mish-mash of Johnny Cash and AC/DC - thanks Pandora. I couldn't tell you about the patio. It was January in Cleveland.

Yeah, you come here to try their brews. If you don't come here for the beer perhaps you should revisit your agenda. There are 24 taps available and the selection is a well thought out mix of new and old favorites. It's also heavy on the locals, as it should be, with offerings from Great Lakes, Columbus, Market Garden, and Fat Heads. Oh yeah, there are also several Nano selections brewed right there on site. On this particular evening I had the Namber (a pretty hop-forward amber ale with a nicely balanced malt backbone), Midnight Express (a brilliant rye IPA hopped heavily with grapefruity Citra hops) and #Kolsch (a light, pale yellow ale with lager-like characteristics and a nice bready aftertaste). All were excellent. Anyone that stays these beers are just \"passable\" clearly needs to check their palate at the door. The brewmasters are very talented and the ultra small batches give them license to show off. Well done.

Now for the food. They have a pretty limited menu here, but we were OK with this having already done our homework. It was to be a burger night for us. Here's the low-down:

We kicked it off with the warm hummus platter. Not a bad dish. A sharing sized bowl of warm hummus covered in melted cheese and diced red onion surrounded by triangles of toasty warm pita. I thought the hummus was well-seasoned and velvety smooth. 

The burgers, while not the best I've ever had, were tasty and complimented the Nano brews. I had the Fun Guy (duxelle, sauteed mushrooms, steak sauce, cheddar & fried onion ring). What is duxelle? Don't be a lazy ass and Google it yourself, geez. My wife opted for the Acid Trip (pickled onion, balsamic reduction, coleslaw, cheddar & mayo). As others have stated, the buns they use on the burgers are perfect - soft and absorbent without being weak. I hate when I bite into a burger and the guts shoot out the other side.  Both burgers came with a side of waffle fries. The fries were crispy and well-seasoned but nothing to get your panties in a wad over.

If I had to levy a criticism, and I do, it would be about how the meat was cooked. We weren't asked what temp we wanted our beef and when they arrived they were both mid-rare (bright pink in the center). While I don't mind a little moo left in the meat my wife is more a medium well person. To her credit, she muscled through it and by the end actually had no complaints about the taste.

All in all, not a bad joint. The schtick of the whole deal, small-batch beers brewed on site paired with burgers, worked OK for me. Good food, good beer. I suppose they accomplished. I do think they should have more than just 3 of their own beers on tap and if a rye-PA is what they are considering \"adventurous and experimental\" they've gotta dig deeper. I wasn't blown away but if they manage to concoct some truly unique brews I might go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"Nano Brew has officially overtaken Market Garden as my fav spot in Ohio City. 

Food: A friend and I both ordered burgers and split the mac & cheese bites. My Spicy (turkey) Burger was delicious and just the right serving size (read: not overwhelmingly huge). The mac & cheese bites and the accompanying spicy ranch dipping sauce were decadent and delightful. 

Nightlife: Truthfully, beer isn't my drink of choice but I have had some amazing brews here. The chocolate shake porter stands out in my mind.

Summer Fun: Everyone knows that Cleveland comes alive during the summer months. Nanobrew is no exception. Their spacious back patio features giant Jenga and Connect Four. Love!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and nothing has declined by way of service, food, beer selection or atmosphere. The bartenders are witty and fun and can make a great cocktail. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly. My favorite food items are the hangover fries, stoner fries and the \"everything\" pretzel. You'd be doing yourself a favor by stopping in!"}
{"text":"So, I really love Nano. I used to be a carnivore and a burger eater, and I loved their tasty hamburgers that seem to be just the right size. I have since become a pescatarian and have begun eating the burgers with the black eyed pea patty or falafel. Still 100% yum. 

Nano also has some wonderful other main dishes and apps. Their fish sandwich (Oh My Cod) used to only be served during some fascist holiday called Lent??? but is now back and delish. I used to love the chili. Their Nannuggests (chicken nuggets) are a favorite of my at times picky mother. The Mac n Cheese bites are dangerously good as are the fried pickles IF you like pickles. And when the Everything Pretzel is on, ITS ON, and you'll find yourself ordering a second. 

But here's where a star disappears...the music! Chili Peppers, Vertical Horizon, Hootie & the Blowfish, Eve6, SLOW GREEN DAY...you know what, mix in this 90s emo before we knew what emo was with other fun stuff but don't throw it at me all at once. Good thing there's plenty of Pokemon stops nearby and the food and beer is so good. I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Pretty good experience. Eclectic and unique menu. Saturday wait time was 25 minutes but close to other attractions, Mitchell's etc. Tap beer selection is limited to less than a dozen beers and they're all microbrews made locally. Hostess was nice, service was so so. Nice interior overall and good spot to see a game if your an Indians fan. If not, expect to be treated with hostility. Your in Tribe Town and they don't let you forget it here. . I have tried both the Adobe chicken sandwich and the pulled pork grilled cheese.  Both are good. Lunch per person is about 15 bucks out the door. Park in municipal out back."}
{"text":"That staff was not as nice and friendly as they could have been. Granted it was the day of a festival but the 1/2 assed attitude from everyone (except the blonde host!!) was shocking! On another note, the food is awesome! EXCEPT! They don't have blue cheese to go with wings, only ranch... but they did put blue cheese crumbles on my wings to make up for it!"}
{"text":"Really cool place! Like most Ohio city restaurants it gets super busy so be prepared to sit at the bar or wait awhile. There are two bars and the atmosphere is rustic, and nice and cozy. They always have a grilled cheese on special which I ordered with tomato soup. I'm still a little confused because I thought my grilled cheese, like the other sandwiches, came with waffle fries but it didn't. It could have been the way I ordered it with the soup. The grilled \"cheesey\" on special had various cheeses and squash inside. It was huge, definitely worth it. I was so stuffed I couldn't finish it. The bartender was really nice and helpful despite being very busy. We also got a burger that tasted really good, I'll be trying one of those next time!"}
{"text":"The remodel is awesome. There's so much space to move around. Staff is friendly and the drinks and food are good. It's a great place to stop when on 25th to get away from the huge crowd at Townhall. The patio is also really nice with an outdoor bar and tons of seating."}
{"text":"Delicious burger and waffle fries for $6.50, a great price for the perfect portion. A hungry guy might want a double patty but for a late lunch to break through a  hangover this worked perfectly for me! Service to get our food and drinks was a little slow but cashing out was a breeze. About $5 per draft - house saison was my fav."}
{"text":"Been to Nano Brew several times for drinks but tried the food for the first time this past weekend.  Realistically, it's not the best food you can get in Ohio City - but it was good and we will definitely be going back.

Tried the spicy burger - patties are on the smaller side compared to what you are served at most restaurants (not a complaint - I think the size was perfect), so don't go expecting a massive pile of food.  Spicy mayo and pepper mix was perfect, great taste but not overkill on the heat.  Would definitely recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"Wish the price of the beer was for a pint, not a smaller glass for $4.50 or more."}
{"text":"This place was PACKED. Went for late night food. They serve late which is awesome. Ended up having to get our food to go because they had 1 cook & he got slammed w/ orders. I got pork schnitzel sandwich. The breading was dark but still good.. however there was NO  potato salad on sandwich as described.. Disappointing.  Boyfriend ordered the spicy burger ($9) He said it was OK. He wasn't super impressed. Waffle fries were good. Prices are reasonable. Debating whether we'd give them another shot."}
{"text":"Super friendly wait staff. The atmosphere was unique, as were the names of dishes on the menu, but everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on a Sunday. the place was not busy. I love fries so I got their waffle fries with the 3 dipping sauces. They were awesome! Since i just ate 4 lbs of potatoes i tried to keep it light and get their Migas for my main meal. Well the Migas were HUGE, i could barely eat half. Service was great.

Looked like they had a good selection of beer on tap, even though i didn't have any.

Would go back and try again!"}
{"text":"Whenever were in Cleveland, we frequent Ohio City 8/10 times. (Small area, wide beer selection)  We are beer lovers and we were excited to see what interesting beers Nano Brew would offer. Walking in and seeing that the atmosphere had the standard Sam McNulty / Ohio City MO, I was hoping the beers would differ. True brewery style. Creative, innovative, pallate challenging. However after visiting a few times I feel like all they are is a test batch location for Market Garden. Sometimes they have something on that they're working on, sometimes they don't. Sometimes they have some stuff that they have developed for Market Garden, sometimes 95% is guest taps.

Good news is they have late-night food until 2 AM. Always a plus after sampling several beers. We had the chili cheeseburger and grilled cheesy, both with waffle fries. The grilled cheese was good. In fact they goofed up our order and brought out two in the beginning - which I wish we would've, because 1. it was good and 2. the chili cheeseburger was sooooo spicy! And I like spicy stuff!

Bartender was friendly. We were in our own conversation, but in between she would always be sure to come over and make sure everything was okay.

We'll go back again because really I have no problem with this place. I do hope they start to do some creative stuff with their beer. And bringing the ski ball machine back wouldn't hurt either! Ha ha!"}
{"text":"The food is solid, trivia Tuesdays are fun, and the beer selection is great. They have a nice staff and great space in downtown cleveland. It's a wonderful place for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I went here strictly for their beer, so if you're going here to eat this review won't help you. As for their brew, I was very impressed! When we went they had the tandem Cruiser, Resinhead Red, and Nano Namber Ale on tap... all of these beers were solid, the Tandem Cruiser may actually be the first beer my wife has tried and tolerated."}
{"text":"I was sooo hungry that I just walked in there to get something to eat! I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with waffle fries! Now I love French fries ,but these fries were not that great! They were like really hard and crunchy and the spices on the sandwich I really didn't care for that much! The staff were were friendly and the bar itself was really nice as well!"}
{"text":"Day-um. Talk about a menu update. 

Either that or I'm just really, REALLY slow to figure that out--either way, their food is fun, laid-back, delicious and Grandma Lageson approved! And the service is bomb-diggity. 

This past Friday the guy and I bopped around Ohio City and ended up here in search of a quick, yet effective bite to eat. He had the fried chicken sliders, I had the regular burger sliders and we both brought my family back the next day. Yep--two days in a row. That's how much we loved everything! 

First, the beers are great--but that's not my focus here. I think there are enough reviews about the brews, decor, bike-friendly nature, so I'll skip that part. The fried chicken sliders are everything you'd want in a sweet, yet savory combo. The man friend was ridiculously happy. My sliders were a treat, with buttered, toasted mini buns, tender ground beef, homemade pickles and other miscellaneous toppings I scarfed without knowing. 

The next day my parents were in the area looking for a dog-friendly spot, so we had to take them back here. My Grandma ordered the egg salad sandwich and cleaned her plate. Nothing but great compliments from her! My Mom had the Acid Trip burger and she wouldn't stop talking about it days afterward. My Dad tried the fried chicken sliders and ordered the stoner fries. Let me tell you--any place that still embraces cheese sauce of any kind AND lets your bring your pooch gets my vote. Happy, happy happiness (aka: cheese sauce and chorizo black bean chili) piled on waffle fries with a side of ranch. Yes--I had to go to the gym the next day but it was worth it.

Also, when you're without the fam (or with them, whatever--my family parties) head out to their huge back patio and play giant Jenga. It's awesome. Hell, have a few beers and tune up your bike. And please, skip the judge-ies of what this space used to be and embrace it for who it is now."}
{"text":"So, if you've read any of my past reviews... a few of them may hint at the fact that I LOVE to people watch. Good Lordy, this is a great place for that to happen. Drunk magicians, MILFs with men half their age, and drunk girls tripping over there feet to impress sober guys... This establishment has it all!

So, I'm a saison kinda girl - and I got two that night - prices are super reasonable. I honestly expected to pay more than $5 for a pint of beer! My boyfriend got two different sour beers (so if you're into those, yes, they have them.)

Good people watching - check. Good beer prices - check. 

I wasn't too hungry, but my honey and I split a falafel pita. Fries could have had a little bit of seasoning - they were bland. But at least they were waffle fries. The pita could have had more falafel - you really get more pita than you do falafel and that was disappointing. 

Service outside is hit or miss. I imagine this is based on how busy Nano is on a Saturday night. We were on the patio for the entire evening and only at the end, did the bartender come over to refill waters and bring us our check. We walked up to the bar to order food and beers, and gather our change.  

Nano was busy - there was an Indians game going on that night - but somehow we managed to grab a table to ourselves and make a cozy date night out of it. I guess the moral of this review is that, if you're not looking to be catered to, and you're up for a low-maintenance evening where you can hang out with a group of friends/have a date night, and have minimal interruptions then you should definitely go. 

I'd be interested in checking out their brunch on a Sunday - I was also impressed that this place is open 365 days a year."}
{"text":"Great local beer selection, beautiful outdoor seating area, and the best burger I've had in a long time! Came here on a Sunday afternoon during brunch hours. Easily found a table outside on their gorgeous patio. Their brunch menu included egg scrambles, biscuits & gravy and burgers. When I first saw the menu I was disappointed that they didn't have many non-breakfast options. I ordered the Acid Trip burger (\"Voted most unique burger in Cleveland\") which came with waffle fries. It was an amazing burger- and I'm not much of a burger lover in the first place. The bun was buttery, the sauce was drippin' and the crunchy, creamy slaw sealed the deal. Loved that you could order beef, falafel or black bean for any of the burgers. Will definitely be back to try more burgers!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a few beers and sat at the bar.  They had a nice selection and the people were really nice.  They let us try a few different beers on tap too which is always a plus.  We will have to go back and try the food!!"}
{"text":"I'm adding an extra star from my previous review. I'm here on a Monday night packed house and there are two ladies running the whole place, busting their asses and doing a GREAT job. Awesome service! A+++ ladies. I'm so proud."}
{"text":"Bartenders are friendly, good seating, lots of space. We came only for the beer but the menu looks appealing. Would definitely order if we were hungry!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Rye IPA is delicious. Cool staff. Making me happy to be in Cleveland. 

Stopped here after going to the Great Lakes Brewery which had good beer but was over crowded and not enough staff for what I experienced. 

I only came here for beer. Like an American."}
{"text":"This is a review solely based on the beer as I didn't get any food. The venue and staff were pretty cool. The bartender was happy to chat about the place and their beers, and he always kept our water glasses full, which I can't tell you how much I appreciate. 

As for the beer, they have a few of their own, and then a decent list of things from other places. I tried the Nano Mandarina pale ale, and my friend had the Nano Amber. We agreed that both were good and while I normally don't like Pale ales, this was very drinkable. 

All in all we had a good experience with good service and beer."}
{"text":"If you want a table, make sure the owners are not coming in that night. Got kicked off our table one hour prior to the owners coming in. They had two out of the five tables reserved. Go to market garden or Great Lakes.......better food, better beer"}
{"text":"If you want a variety of great and unexpected beers in a hip place, this is it. I wish this place was in my city!"}
{"text":"Love Nano Brew overall, but last night the service was lagging. I go every Tuesday night for trivia and the place was full. They only had two servers on and we waited a long time to get a server to come over at first. Once she did, we were pretty good the rest of the night. I would think on Trivia nights they would make sure they had the proper staff. One of my friends was super hangry!! He went early to make sure he could eat before trivia and ended up waiting 45 minutes to even get menus. The food is good, and the atmosphere is great, though. One of my favorite places to go."}
{"text":"Loved the trivia night on Wednesday. I ordered the pretzel and a beer. Both were very tasty. This bar is definitely worth a stop if you're in Ohio City."}
{"text":"Went for my first time on a beautiful Friday night around 8pm. Decent sized crowd but no problem finding a seat indoors. Outdoors was packed as expected. Not sure since I am still learning my way around W.25, but seemed like a typical W.25/Ohio City type crowd... young, not quite uppity, fairly casual, very friendly. Service was good. Music was unremarkable. I went simply to try their beer, didn't get any eats. I liked what I drank (don't recall the names). Nothing outstanding but everything was enjoyable. I thought it was cool that they had a dude fixing a bicycle in between the bar area and patio."}
{"text":"Took a friend to a few breweries in the Ohio city area over the weekend and this was one of our stops. Very cute inside with a good selection, but sadly I must agree with the other yelp reviewers--the staff was not at all attentive. Taking it off my list for future visitors."}
{"text":"I go to Nano Brew quite regularly for their Tuesday trivia (tons of fun) and on the weekends. The place has become quite massive since their expansion and it turns into a three-room bar when they open all the sections. It is a casual restaurant/bar with an awesome patio out back in the summer and a giant jenga game, which is always a plus. Their beer selection is quite good and most of them only cost $5 for quality craft beers. The staff is really nice as well and attentive. 

The one downside is that the food that I've tried at least is generally just okay. They use pretty basic ingredients, mostly from frozen, and I've never been crazy about a meal there. They do have good mac & cheese bites though and my friend swears by their chili. I've had the stoner fries and one of their grilled cheeses of the day though as well and they were pretty boring despite the crazy ingredients. 

Bottom line- awesome bar to go to. Definitely a good place for a drink or to hang out. The food is decent as well."}
{"text":"Creative quirky menu with an outstanding execution . Great atmosphere ! Service is always accompanied with a unique personality, it is always a great experience!"}
{"text":"Nice bar and seating.  Interesting building.  TONS of different beers available, both in the bottle/can and on top and a good array of liquor behind the bar.  Not many wine options that i could see.

We didn't have dinner there, just some beer (Including one brewed by Nano and one brewed by Market District).  We were there early (before 9) and had the place nearly to ourselves, which was nice.  Easy public parking right behind the bar itself.

I would NOT take my kids there and I'll take them just about anyplace."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere.  Mediocre beer from this brewer but many special & good guest taps.  Outdoor seating.  Luke warm staff concerned mostly about themselves.   Would have like an initial intro to the menu but didn't get one.  Bike friendly.  Giant Jenga in back.  I'd give it a second chance.  Hopefully the C squad was working when I was there (Sat afternoon) & they have the A squad on for busier times."}
{"text":"I think the place is pretty good, and I'll be back.  There are currently only two \"nano\" brews on tap, and they weren't anything exciting--an amber and a black IPA.  While they were quite good, I'm hoping to see the brewmaster use the tiny batch production as a means for interesting experimentation.  Nano keeps a good collection of beers on tap, and the burgers are pretty good.  I also like that you can order fried plantains instead of fries.  In terms of a burgers and beer joint, I dig Nano Brew.

Side note: they have a \"stoner poutine\" on the menu.  Poutine is a food invented in Quebec. Over in Frenchyville, it's pronounced putsn. Therefore, the correct pronunciation is putsn. So, no more of this poo-teen nonsense.  With that out of the way, poutine is one of my most favorite foods.  It can come in different varieties from the norm, but I think calling Nano's dish poutine is a bit of a stretch.  It's really good, don't get me wrong, but I don't think I can call this poutine.  But I won't factor the semantics into my rating.  Eat, enjoy, be happy, and drink some beers!"}
{"text":"Awesome, just a awesome place to hang out. Good people and great beers. Also had Mac and cheese bites and I must say the best I ever had. Also enjoyed a burger which was solid. But the beer is what we came for. So be prepared to sit a while and try several beers. U won't wanna leave"}
{"text":"Nano Brew was hit or miss for me. Solid beer and decent food, but not great service. It was pretty busy when we stopped in, but they only had 2 people working up front. We waited at the bar for like 15 minutes before even seeing a bartender. We waited it out, but some people who sat down at the same time we did left. From getting our beers to getting the food, everything just seemed to take a really long time. If the service was better, this would easily be a 4 star place for me.
Nano Brew only had 3 of their own beers on tap, 4 from Market Garden, and a handful from other craft breweries. We went with a flight of the 3 Nano beers and one of the other crafts. The Nano beers were all good. Nothing spectacular, but good solid beers. I thought a flight was a little pricey at $9 for four 4 oz samples. We also got an order of the tots which came with 4 dipping sauces. The tots were good, nice and crispy and salty. It came with your typical ketchup and what seemed like canned stadium nacho cheese, which was a bummer. They had a homemade ranch which was really delicious and herby, and they have a spicy mayo, which was damn spicy and smokey from chipotles. These two sauces saved the tots from the fake cheese. After reading the menu and seeing what other people ordered makes me want to come back sometime to try more of the food. Its worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times in the past few weeks and besides the games I've experienced (Giant Jenga and trivia night), I've been unimpressed. This review really borders on a 2 because the employees here are always passive, disinterested, and slow. This past visit, our waitress forgot our appetizer and didn't even act like she cared that she had forgotten it.

The food here is just okay. Yes, they have the acid trip burger which is unique, but the hamburger patty itself is not a good cut of meat nor is it cooked to order. The waffle fries are not my fav, but that is just personal preference. I've had a few appetizers here, including the friend mac and cheese bites and fried pickles and both were okay.

I think if you are looking for a late night drink or drunk food, this is the place to go. Or even if you are looking for a happy hour or place to just grab a drink, this is your place. But if you are looking to get a good dinner while sober, I would recommend checking out one of the many other restaurants on West 25th street."}
{"text":"Nano Brewery is a great staple bar and restaurant for Ohio City.

Their food is good. The menu isn't huge but they change up their specials daily and it's always delicious.

They sell their own beer as well as other local beers. The staff there is always really friendly which is a major plus.

They expanded a few months ago and bought the space next door. There is a lot more room for movement - thank god. Nano recently redid the outdoor patio and it's awesome! The now have an upper deck and more space on the side. It's a major improvement.

They have trivia on Tuesday which is really fun.  I love this place and frequent it very often!"}
{"text":"Not reviewing the food, just the bar atmosphere. Stopped in here for post-dinner brews on a Saturday night, and it sure was busy. I know they replaced Garage bar, but to me, the inside doesn't look much different than it did before. The most positive thing is the selection of beers they now have. I tried the Nano citramax, which I thought was excellent. I lean towards the hoppy beers, and this was just the right amount of citrus-y sweet with hoppy flavor. They also have a few other of their own brew concoctions. I'll have to try those another time. 

They also have selections from GL and Market Garden, which I think is great. They are supporting the businesses right down the street in their very own hub. 

For all this, they get an A-OK."}
{"text":"Small and a little noisy. Came here on a recommendation of  a friend. Only issue was the waitress. She was not really familiar with the menu and misled us a bit and the service was a little spotty. I had the schnitzel burger and my wife had a pork burger that I can't remember the name of, sorry. Both were good although mine was a little overcooked and dry. The waffle fries were crispy and delicious. We also shared the fried plantain with three dipping sauces. They were delicious too. I don't drink beer but my wife said the Nano brew she had was very good. If in the area, I would go back and try a real beef burger that they are known for. Should have realized the schnitzel didn't have a beef patty too! If I go back, I'll revisit the review."}
{"text":"I was in town over the weekend and a friend suggested we grab drinks at Nano Brew. The place was crowded but not too bad for a bar on a Friday night, getting drinks was easy and we were able to get a table for the 5 of us. No complaints there! The beer selection was not the largest but it was absolutely fantastic, with guest taps and house taps that would suit any taste.

We also ordered fries with cheese, ranch, ketchup, and spicy mayo. They weren't impressive or anything but they certainly got the job done! The menu looked delicious and next time I'd back I'd love to try some of the food so I could give a more complete review. Fried oreos? C'mon! That's amazing!"}
{"text":"After a year and a half, my boyfriend and I decided to give nano another shot. We've heard more and more great things from people we trust. And I am so glad that we came back. 
It's like night and day. We arrived around 2 and sat out on the patio with our small dog and drank a couple of beers and enjoys some fantastic food. We shared some hummus, a house salad and the BLT. The service was knowledgeable, attentive and more than accommodating as I can be a bit particular when we dine out. 
The spiked hummus - $7.50 - was light, summery and a great starter. 
The house salad - $6 -  was great. Nothing too crazy but the vinaigrette was so flavorful. I was pretty surprised when we cleared the plate super quickly. 
The BLT - $7.50 - was amazing. Pork belly, oven roasted toms, lettuce and mayo. Nothing too crazy, but a nice lunch to share with a friend. (However I will have to say I slathered a generous helping of sriracha on it.) The pork belly is a little difficult to pull apart without a fork and knife. Maybe smaller pieces of the pork belly would help? Also, if a different, sturdier bread was used, perhaps a thick sourdough, would take the sandwich to the next level. 

The beer choices were fantastic and incredibly well priced. Not a single beer listed above $7. Even the sampler is only $8 for four, $4 pours. (Try saying that 5 times fast.)

With prices, food and drinks like this, We will definitely be back and will invite plenty of friends."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! Portion sizes are just right. Wide range of drinks and tons of unique burgers."}
{"text":"Came here twice in one week, I really, really enjoyed this place. Located in Ohio City, this place has a hipster feels and warehouse setup that I loved. Their beers are good (could not get enough of the Gustavo, Black IPA) and atmosphere make it a nice relaxing place to enjoy a pint with friends and watch some sports. 

For food, one time I went with waffle fries, and the other with the everything pretzel. The everything pretzel was incredible. It was huge, just enough saltiness, and served with some cream cheese. I could eat that every day. The waffle fries were nothing special, a little soggy even; however, the dipping sauces were pretty good, especially the chipotle mayo. Next time I am in the Land I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I had a private surprise birthday party at Nano and it was PERFECT. The staff was unbelievable (Nathan worked with me one on one, responded to my emails promptly and was so courteous and professional). I feel so fortunate that I stumbled upon this bar for my event, it went off without one problem. The servers were friendly, the food was great, and everyone had an awesome time. Unfortunately, we had to come inside instead of using the upstairs patio because of poor weather, but it ended up working out even better! The space is magnificent, the music was great, and I highly recommend Nano Brew for any private event you hold."}
{"text":"Went into nano brew Sunday after work...expecting a nice meal before heading home on a Sunday evening. Decided to leave my tab open at the bar while I was deciding what to have for my meal. Within the hour span that I was at the bar, my credit card had gone missing. Although the previous bartender had come and gone from the time I arrived, the bartenders that were trying to find my missing card were very unapologetic about the situation. Cancelling the card was a suggestion from the staff. I am very unsettled about the lack of customer service. Definitely will not return based on surrounding competition."}
{"text":"Nano Brew is a great place amongst others in Ohio City. I frequent this bar a lot for pregaming and for an occasion bite to eat. The staff is always pleasant and accommodating. Nano Brew is pretty cool in that it has an indoor and outdoor bar. It also has a roof top patio, which is were I usually sit on the hot summer nights. Anywho 2 thumbs up and can't wait until I visit Nano Brew again."}
{"text":"Love the music and the atmosphere. And the staff was very friendly even under trying circumstances. Great beer selection. The waffle fries were a little over done, but the burgers were excellent! Will definitely come again when we're back in Cleveland"}
{"text":"This bar has a great location and set up. With both indoor and outdoor seating and bars, it's an ideal place to spend a sunny afternoon drinking a beer and watching a baseball game..... 

The catch is that the bartenders, mostly one in particular (long beard) at the outdoor bar were completely rude. My boyfriend and I sat down and we waited 10 minutes to have anybody even make eye contact with us. There was food sitting in front of us from the people beforehand and it wasn't cleared until we finally got their attention. I understand places get busy, but even some sort of acknowledgement that we sat down and that they'd get with us shortly would have been appreciated."}
{"text":"I am giving Nano Brew five stars, because the Spicy Burger is hands down my favorite burger in Cleveland. This burger was named one the \"Best 33 Burgers in America\" by Thrillist, and is covered in the perfect combination of cheddar, poblanos, caramelized onions, spicy mayo, and greens. I am not a fan of incredibly spicy food, which this burger is not (despite the name). It is a very mild heat and will not ruin your esophagus for the rest of the night. I find it to be the perfect combination with a cold beer. It's always very juicy, and the bun is perfect and buttery. The meat to bun ratio is perfection. 

I also appreciate that Nano Brew serves appropriate portion sizes. The burgers are not huge, and you get a single serving of waffle fries (not 3). If you're looking for a place where you're likely to have some leftovers, this is not your place. I love that I do not feel like I am wasting food, nor do I have to bring food back to my car if I'm in the area for the night. I always clear my basket. If you're hungrier - any of the burgers can be ordered as a double instead of a single.

I've visited Nano Brew countless times (e.g. for just beers, for beers and apps, for beers and burgers) and at all times of the year. Despite all the negative reviews re: poor service, this has never been my experience. For example: I visited last night, a Saturday night, around 5:45 pm before going over to the Cavs game. Had no problem finding two seats at the bar. Service was prompt and friendly. The keg ran out on the beer I ordered before my pint glass was full, and because I didn't instantaneously get a full glass while they changed the keg, the server gave me the 3/4 full glass on the house. 

Will be back!"}
{"text":"great background music, service and food.  had the hummus and it's creamy and rich.  delicious non gmo snacks."}
{"text":"I love Nano Brew! It continues to be a go-to spot for me. I really like the vibe and have grabbed a drink with friends here many o' times. I believe they have 25 brews on draft, which is awesome. Whether you want a cider or an IPA, they have it all.

In the back, they have a life-size Jenga set-up, so be ready for the inevitable giant crashing noise every 10-15 minutes! Nano Brew has 2 rooms of high-top tables and I've never had a problem walking in and getting a table. They're open pretty late, which makes it an ideal spot to get together with friends and have a great night out.

When I come here, its usually for the beer. I've ordered food before, like the pulled pork sandwich, but always found it kind of hard to eat (the bread is usually wet and falls apart fast). But hey, this is Nano Brew. Come for the beer! The bartenders are really knowledgable and always have a great suggestion. I love how they also carry local Market Garden and Butcher + Brewer beers! Everyone can find a beer on the menu they'll love. Stop by!"}
{"text":"We go there frequently for a quick beer.  They recently expanded from a small one bar restaurant to a huge restaurant with a large wrap around bar and another huge bar on the far side of the restaurant.  They also just remodeled the patio and it's beautiful, modern, has 2 levels for seating as well as a full bar.  It may be the nicest patio in Cleveland.   They always have a good beer list with great guest brews, a couple of their own brews and a few from sister restaurant Market Garden Brewery.  We have never tried their food however."}
{"text":"Food mediocre, none of the four dishes we ordered were that good and our server acted like he was too cool for school.  If you don't enjoy interacting with people then you shouldn't be in the service industry. Not impressed at all won't be back anytime soon"}
{"text":"Well, where do I start. First of all. Only 2 of your beers available and both the same style. The rest were mostly Market Garden beers. Hmmmm, then found out they are owned by Market Garden. The service was non-existant. The best part was sitting outside with good weather. Great place only if you are a millennial and do not really care about where you go for craft beer. Go across the street to Bad Tom Smith for real craft beer. If I want Market Garden. I would go to Market Garden. Right down the street."}
{"text":"A little background, I had been here once before after a night at a concert at Nautica. After the concert we walked to Ohio City and wandered into this bar and hung out on the roof patio for a few hours. I mainly recall the roof patio and the moose head on the wall from that adventure but had no idea I was at Nano Brew at the time.

Fast forward to planning a trip for my Birthday to Ohio City and we decided to try a few places. On the way up I told the story from the concert and we all had a good laugh when we walked into Nano and there was the moose head I had mentioned! We found where I had been nearly a year earlier!  Mystery solved!

I really liked this place. It was a nice afternoon to try a flight of their beers. The Raddler was excellent but the others were just average. They also had a few from Market Garden that weren't too bad. We decided to grab a quick bite as well while we were there and I tried the Falafel. It was pretty dry and bland for my taste but not terrible.  I'd probably try something else next time. The service was fast and friendly. They had no problem putting on the Penguins game for us.  

At the end of the day, it's the laid back atmosphere that really stands out to me.  Definitely a great place to kick back and have a drink and a quick bite.  Or you know, a destination to aimlessly wander into around midnight after a concert ;)"}
{"text":"Can't believe this bar has the same owner as bier market 
Really felt like my business was a burden"}
{"text":"More of a bar than brewery (heck, I suspect the brew equipment on display is just that). The Acid Trip burger and waffle fries are money. Beautiful facility with large patio, and an elevated patio that overlooks the downtown skyline."}
{"text":"Now that its summer in Cleveland and the weather has warmed, patio drinking is in order. A group of us decided on Nano in Ohio City and thankfully it was busy but not packed like Market Garden was.  

Nano had a nice outdoor section with a busy outdoor bar. Plenty of tables to sit and chat, and 2 TVs outside to keep an eye on the game as well.  Drinks were decently priced with a good selection of beers and friendly bartenders.  Playing giant Jenga was a lot of fun as well!  

Ended up spending the majority of the evening here and had a lot of fun.  I'll have to come back and try to food at some point!"}
{"text":"Pretty shitty service. They seem to have no organized plan. We were sitting at the back bar and after us and several others waited forever someone finally came over and asked if we needed anything. Um hello!! shouldn't you have someone designated to serve patrons at the bar? 

They literally are a nano brewery. Only like 3 of their own beers on tap. I wasn't a huge fan of any of them but they weren't bad. 

The tater tots were the saving grace. They were just standard tots but cooked to a nice crisp. And they came with four really good dipping sauces. 

Hope they figure out the service issue!"}
{"text":"Had the \"fun guy\" burger. Was pretty solid, service was decent. Nothing special for lunch. Great spot for nightlife though, the bar is very crowded but the beer is good and the people are friendly."}
{"text":"Good beer selection, good burgers. Fries are okay-- some options are amazing I there's are really bland. It's one of the better places to drink on W 25th."}
{"text":"Nano Brew seems like it would be right up my alley with their own brews on tap as well as a large selection of guest beers. On a Sunday night during Memorial Day weekend, most of the restaurants were too packed for a group of 9 with the exception of Nano Brew. Unfortunately that red flag went unnoticed by our group. 

I'm going to assume they were short staffed. There were no servers outside on the patio and you had to order your food at the bar. We overheard fellow patrons complaining that they had been waiting for 45 minutes for fries - Red flag 2. We took our chance since it was barely 1/3 full and decided to order: Mac and cheese bites, burgers, sandwiches....nothing too complex. While we waited we decided to try out their own beers...which were all tapped out. Ok - well I'll have one the guest beers....wait that's out too? Ok, how about....no? What DO you have? Red Flag 3

We ordered around 7:45 and our first set of mac and cheese bites came out around 8:30. The second set of Mac and cheese bites came out at 9:30pm. Whoa whoa whoa - couldn't you have just put two sets of bites in the fryer? I ordered a burger which took an HOUR AND A HALF to get to table. When it arrived they were out of both pickles and waffle fries. Oh and the burger took up about 50% of the bun. I had a bun with ketchup and lettuce with a slider sized portion of beef. (See photo attached)

The manager did seem to feel bad and offered us a free round of drinks. I appreciate the effort - but unfortunately I would continue to discourage anyone from visiting. Manager, you are the only reason I am giving this place 2 stars and not 1. However when your restaurant is mainly empty and the service is still horrendous - something is severely wrong. Cleveland, you could do better."}
{"text":"I went to Nano Brew with a friend over the holidays.  We were there on a Friday night, and it was super crowded with people, who were extremely trashed and trying to be cool.  I sometimes love Ohio City and sometimes can't stand the crowds. There was nothing really special about Nano Brew.  We grabbed two beers and then called it a night."}
{"text":"Mac n cheese bites are to die for! They use real Mac n cheese unlike other places where it's frozen and processed. Got a flight of beers and there wasn't one I disliked. 

I still give this place the same rating. They still have the best Mac n cheese bites!! Of course I had to get them again. But I wanted to elaborate more on the service. 

We were sat right away but walking in I wasn't sure if the hostess was the hostess or not because she wasn't at her post instead she was doing the art work for their beer list. Their beers are beautifully displayed on the walls up by the bar. Very cool looking! Our waiter met us with water right away and took our drink order. However they were out of 4 beers my friend asked for. It would have been helpful for them to tell us that the beers listed on the walls were the only ones available because we were ordering from the menu and ordering ones they were out of. But he did tell us it was because they just had the Ohio City fair last weekend and that's why they were out of most of their beers until their next shipment so .. you can't be mad about that. The other thing pictured in my review is the stoner fries. They were good but they did forget my ranch when they brought it out but I didn't feel like I was missing it when I was eating it. We also tried the PBJ burger and it was good but I felt like I didn't didn't have hardly any bacon jam on it. And the peanut butter was a little over powering because of that."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a recent Saturday afternoon bike ride, having been seduced by their bike-friendly advertising and new bike box for parking. The weather was nice enough to enjoy the back patio, so we plopped ourselves down and got to drinking and eating. We tried both of their house beers, which we gave high marks to. They have a dazzling array of guest brews, too. To eat we had pumpkin kibbe, which just sounded too weird and good to pass up. They were a pleasant surprise. We then inhaled a large portion of tasty plantain chips with four different dipping sauces. Everything was great, but my 30-something self felt like I had aged out of this place a bit. I think I'll be sticking to daytime drinking here, and I hope I can keep arriving on my bike rather than a mobility scooter."}
{"text":"Had the most awesome of summer nights drinking beer on their back patio. Food menu is ok - most notably they offer some pretty original burgers and a 'burger of the day'. The draw for me to this place though is the beer and ambience."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a NANO #KOLSCH followed by a NANO PARTICLE ACCELERATOR DOUBLE RYE IPA before my Spicy was served. Amazing burger and the waffle fries needed no salt. I will be returning at least twice to try the Acid Trip and the PB&J!"}
{"text":"Conceptually...I like this place and the fact that a lot less is a lot more.  The beer is solid, but I have never seen the equipment in use at this place.  As a home brewer I am intrigued in small systems and how they operate (especially in a small business), but have never seen this one in action.

Cool concept...just want to see the entire concept working!"}
{"text":"Solid gastropub in the Ohio City neighborhood of Cleveland. I really liked the ambiance and the music. The tap list was great- offering brews from many local establishments like Fatheads, Nano's own local brews, and many others as well as guest taps from Revolution in Chicago and a few other places. Decent service, and the food was okay. The beer is what shines."}
{"text":"Real talk? I never liked the Garage Bar. It always felt to me like TGI Friday's for rockabilly dudes, so I was glad to hear that Sam McNulty had bought the space after the Garage closed down.

Cruised up to Nano today at 1 PM (they open at noon on weekends, which is nice) and the place was pretty empty, so we sat at the bar. Bartender was friendly, efficient and knowledgeable, which is a good sign in a beer-centric (I guess? That's probably not a word) place. The aesthetic is pretty minimalist, but I think it works well for the space. My companion wasn't drinking; I had their black IPA, and I liked it very much - not overly hoppy and very flavorful. The menu is limited, so if you're not into burgers, this may not be the place for you. I had the Spicy Burger, which was tasty without being too spicy, like a lot of \"spicy\" burgers can be (like Melt's? I mean I like a lot of spice, but not to where it makes eating the rest of my meal uncomfortable); my companion had the daily special. This was a 1/2 pound burger topped with caramelized onions, bleu cheese and a fig-bacon chutney and honestly? I really wish I'd gotten that instead, because it. Was. Fantastic! The burgers came with waffle fries, which were crispy but undersalted, and I'm not that big a fan of waffle fries anyway, so. We also split the Stoner Poutine, which - well, it wasn't poutine. It wasn't bad, though, and definitely enough for two people.

Price-wise, I was a little surprised. I don't think I saw a draft for more than $5, and their cheap beers were actually CHEAP (i.e. 16oz. PBR cans for $2), so that was nice. Total cost for two beers, two burgers and an appetizer came to $35 before tip. Not bad! Service was prompt and friendly. I would like to check this place out during a rush, though, as there were maybe four other tables besides us in the place today. Still, I'm real happy with Nano Brew, and I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I read most of the thrillist.com daily emails.  What can I say, they are witty and I love food and booze.  So when I saw the email for the top 33 burgers in the country I checked it out, as usual.  I was surprised to see Nano Brew in Ohio City on the list for the simply named \"spicy burger\".  So, when I was in the area for a beer event I decided to give it a shot to see what a top 33 burger in the country tastes like.  Well, I feel like thrillist lost some credibility...

The theme is cool - certainly hipster (as is most the area) but cool, fun and has a wooden/bike theme as well.  They have a solid beer list (again, this is not groundbreaking for the area) which is posted on the wall with wooden signs.  I do have high expectations for ohio city and tremont restaurants and bars so that certainly played into my experience here.  

We started with a couple apps...the mac and cheese bites and the stoner fries.  Both were pretty decent but nothing I would order again.  I probably liked the dipping sauce for the mac and cheese bites the best.  My highly regarded spicy burger was, well, a massive disappointment.  They cook all their burgers here med-well...which I like mine med-rare.  This did not bother me at all - in fact I prefer when a restaurant \"suggests\" a cook temp on items as I figure they know how to bring the best out of their food.  This honestly tasted like a over cooked, dry steak and shake burger with very minimal spice (especially to be called \"the spicy\") and just really lacks the flavor you would expect.  I have nooooooo problem paying $10 for a burger - but give me the quality. So I found this to be grossly overpriced because of the size and quality.  The waffle fries were aight, but again nothing to rave about.  

Coupled with \"meh\" service and high expectations for a super quality food neighborhood nano brew really disappointed me.  Fortunately there are so many great spots in the area."}
{"text":"Nano Brew got a little less nano. Bigger place than it started out as. Great vibes and a chill hangout on a nice summer night."}
{"text":"Looked like a nice place. Sat down waited 5 minutes to get menu. Another 5 before someone would take order. Then 5 more minutes to try to get a beer. Ask to try a sample of one of the beers. Bartender was standing right in front of tapper where the beer was. Bartender made 2 bloody Mary's before she could get me sample. Few minutes later comes back for me to order a glass. After waiting another 40 min payed for beer and left. Worse service I've ever encountered in my life. That explains why every other restaurant on the road had people waiting outside for a table and u could walk into Nano. From what I've seen they must have ties to Market Garden Brewery which on a visit on Thursday had awesome service. While sitting at bar guy next to us as soon as he gets his food asks for the bill. He pays and leaves shortly later eating half his meal. Another customer had to come to bar and ask for a burger that someone at her table never got. The people sitting next to us were still waiting and were approached about getting another beer. To have 3 beers prior to them ever getting there meals seems crazy. I'd be willing to wait for my meal but when the employees don't care why should I."}
{"text":"Place went downhill after they expanded. Used to visit here 2-3x a week. Havnt been back after being treated awful after asking to put on the CAVS game?"}
{"text":"Where to begin....

Some friends and I gave Nano Brew a try for the first (and probably the last) time. Maybe I didnt enjoy my experience because Im a conventional restaurant goer. Where youre sitted, a waiter comes with menus, and later takes your order, etc. While you sit back, relax, and enjoy your evening with friends. Apparently things at Nano Brew are a bit different. 

We get there, its seat yourself, okay. We got a table out on the patio. Theres gonna be a waiter to come out with menus and get drink orders, right??? Nope. After waiting a good while, I go to the inside bar and ask for menus, and if a waiter could be sent to our table. \" Sure thing!!!\" Im told. 
Another good while goes by before i find a waiter, who apparently was on his way to a break and blew right past us!!! Oookkaayyy!!! Some time later we were told that we are to go to the outside bar to place a food order. Gotcha. We go to the outside bar, and place our order, and include water to be sent with the food. 

The food came, and the food was good. But no water, no napkins, and no utensils. We found the waiter and asked for water for the three of us, and he brought back a small glass, ONE.  By then we were so done, and just left.

Yeah I wont be going back. 

The positive is they offer gluten free options,  and the patio is dog friendly"}
{"text":"Service was very good. We went at 2:30 on a Saturday afternoon. 2 out of 4 of the meals were good. I had pulled pork which was good. The chicken & biscuits were bland as was the chicken paprikosh.  Not sure that I would go back."}
{"text":"Got the hopper burger with chickpeas, and it was almost limp. The burgers are served on buns that aren't high quality- yellow and greasy. The cheddar on my burger was congealed and while wait staff is quick they seem completely ambivalent."}
{"text":"Terrible experience today!  We arrived and were told there was a 20 minute wait.  We went to the back of the restaurant to wait our turn. 40 minutes later the host had disappeared and there was not a single server to be found.  We were the next on the list but other people coming in were seating themselves since there was no host.  We finally found our own table to sit at (which had not been bussed.). Then we waited another 20 minutes and never saw the host or any servers.  After over an hour of waiting we decided to go elsewhere for lunch.

Very disappointing experience with our out of town guests.....will not be going back to try again."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm going to soon be adding Nano Brew to my list of regular restaurants.  My boyfriend had somehow never heard of the place (I think I did via yelp :) ), so I suggested it one night. He LOVED it. He's always talking about going back there.  They have a really good drink selection, ample seating (if you don't get there 
too\" late...it did get pretty packed on a Saturday at about 7 or 8) and pretty attentive servers/bartenders.  My boyfriend asked the male bartender who seemed actually like he was the manager, if the meat for the burgers were ground in house.  Not only did he say yes, but he knew the answer.  There are plenty of restaurants you can go to where the servers have no idea about that stuff (which they should). We each got a burger. My boyfriend loved his (acid trip). We also got the pretzel for an app which was also decent.  We were having a night just hanging out, grabbing a couple drinks and dinner, and the bartender didn't rush us at all, which was also nice and didn't make us feel uncomfortable. Def. coming back here again!"}
{"text":"I love Nano Brew! Before recently, I had only ever come here on a night out to have a few drinks. The beer is always awesome and I've never had issues with the service. I love that they have a giant Jenga game in the back and when it's warm enough, a pretty nice patio to sit on and enjoy your drink of choice. 
     Recently, a few friends and I decided to come here for brunch. I have always heard people rave about the burgers, so I figured their other food should be just as good. I was definitely not disappointed. As an appetizer, my friend ordered the hangover fries. We could not stop eating them! Waffle fries covered in eggs, gravy, and cheese sauce? I'm drooling just thinking about them. For my meal, I ordered the steak and eggs. Taylor tots covered in onions and peppers, hollandaise sauce, and two sunny side up eggs. Again, drooling. Definitely a great spot for whatever you are looking for!"}
{"text":"I like Nano. They have a good selection of drafts (including Market Garden Brewery beers), as well as a good offering of bottles, cans, and liquor. The place is small, but the patio adds a lot of space and doesn't make it feel cramped. There is life-size Jenga in the back, which is always fun, too. A friend got their chicken sliders and she wasn't especially impressed, but didn't say they were bad, either.

My favorite thing about this place is the decor - bicycles are used as decorations, and it just looks really cool.

Nano is a fun place to come with friends if you're on W25, but it doesn't especially stand out amongst other well-known places."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick beer. Got the Nano Jungle Juice Wheat. More juice than wheat but still very good. The bartender Joey was awesome. Would love to come back and try the food sometime!"}
{"text":"This was our second trip to Nano Brew but the first in a reeeeallly long time so I can't remember much except it was pretty tasty that time too.

This time we stopped in for a late lunch/early dinner. We promptly found seats at the bar and ordered some fried pickles and a beer to start. The pickles were good but better to share as an app between four rather than two, I think. We kind of got a fried batter overload after a while. But they were tasty and the remoulade that they came with was good. Beers tried were some porter for Sean which he liked and the Nano Namber (amber ale). That one was quite tasty and I would definitely recommend it. 

We then moved on to the burgers which were both very good. I got the Acid Trip which has cheddar, slaw, pickled onions and some kind of tangy sauce. VERY good. Sean had the Spicy burger which he also liked quite a bit. They don't ask you how you'd like the burgers but I'd say ours came out medium/medium well. They were juicy and yummy so good for me. 

One of my favorite things is that the burgers do come with fries but only a just right amount of fries - not this insane fat-ass American pile of fries that is just crazy like at most places. In my opinion, a small side of fries is just right. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend Nano Brew for a light-ish meal and good beer in Ohio City."}
{"text":"i took my parents and fiancé here the day after christmas to have a drink while we waited for our table at townhall. what a terrible mistake. 

the place was severely understaffed, i think there were 3 bartenders. w 25th in general was crowded so i cannot say it had to be easy for them, however in other reviews you can already see that the wait staff is incredibly rude, so times that by 10000. 

our bartender was blonde with glasses and couldn't have been more rude or unfriendly. didn't crack a smile once and seemed extremely bothered that anyone would want a drink (you work in a bar).

i am also dumbfounded that this place was featured on Food Paradise as one of the best places in the country for late night bar food. maybe it's because everyone is too inebriated to realize that this place is a dump with a bunch of holier than thou idiots \"running\" the place."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim on a Saturday Night. Seating is first come first serve. I wouldn't suggest going if you are in a hurry. Veggie Burger was AWESOME! The staff was friendly even though they were busy. The wait time for food was a little long, but worth it. I'll go again."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday afternoon with my husband after eating somewhere else which is a shame because the food menu looked really good.  My husband loves craft beers and I am so-so on them.  It's hard for me to find ones that aren't too bitter or hoppy for me.  I have to say that the staff wasn't the friendliest around, sadly.  They seemed more interested in their own conversations and cleaning up then taking care of customers.  I indicated that I didn't know what kind of beer I wanted and the server seemed a bit annoyed and said that he'd come back. (What I really needed was info on what the IBU's were on some of the beers)  The staff also totally ignored a lady that came in herself and sat down.  She seemed very pleasant and tried to engage the server in conversation about some of the items on the food menu.  When he really didn't respond, she put the food menu down and didn't order anything.  (I really think she would have if he had been more helpful.)  Then she had to basically chase someone down to take her beer order.  She ordered a sampler and they told her that one of the beers on her list was out and that she only told them the brand of beer on the other one, not which beer they make.  They just kinda left her to figure it out for herself which seemed wrong to me.  It was like they didn't care if she ordered it or not.  She ordered her sampler, drank 2 of the 4 beers, paid and left.  I think she was as frustrated as I was for her and decided to take her business elsewhere.  Even the barmaid was surprised she left but she shouldn't have been after how they treated her.  Anyway, enough about others experience there.  We were treated slightly better than that but we still had to wait awhile between beers for someone to ask if we wanted another one.  The place wasn't that busy so we shouldn't have had to wait.  I will probably give them one more try but that's about it.  I gave them 3 stars because everyone has a bad day and we didn't even try the food but I will update if/when we go back."}
{"text":"How could you not love Nano Brew? In my opinion, this is the best bar on W. 25th in Ohio City. Love the staff, beer menu and food options. Summer time patio days are ones to remember at Nano!"}
{"text":"Great spot, pretty good beers.  I can imagine that the outside area and deck above get busy when the weather is nice, they look like a great place to gather with friends and have drinks.  The food I saw looked good, and everyone that helped me was really nice."}
{"text":"After finishing a glass of wine, there was something in the bottom of the glass to which the short, blonde, bartender Chloe replied very bitchily \"its just always in the bottom of a wine glass.\" Um, no dear, it isn't. And when you're on the service industry, you make it right, you apologize and offer a fresh glass. You don't stare me down and give me attitude. Mr. McNulty, your bar is great. Your beer is great. Chloe, your bartender, needs an attitude adjustment."}
{"text":"Came here last night with my husband for a nightcap and we were very disappointed.  For a Tuesday late night, the bar was slow but it felt like the bartender had no motivation whatsoever to move quickly with our orders.  My husband ordered some fries and they came out cold so we sent them back.  We did get a new order of fries pretty quickl,y but my husband didn't end up finishing it because the fries just weren't that good.  I had an everything bagel and it was just ok. I didn't finish that either.  My husband asked for a box to take his leftover fries home but once again the bartender took forever!  So we just left cash on the bar and left.  I've been here a couple years ago and had their sliders which I remember being really good and I don't remember the service being anywhere near as bad as it was last night.  With so many options in Ohio City, I don't think we'll be visiting Nano Brew again."}
{"text":"\"We can totally move to Cleveland, if you want.\"  

I agree with the review of Nano Brew by my dining partner.  They offer small batches of beer.  Tonight we tried a chocolate chili stout and an excellent rye IPA.  The food menu is a playful version of bar standards.

We're in Cleveland for one night only and already talking about coming back for brunch.

We had originally intended to go to Great Lakes Brewery, but it was full.  That was fortunate."}
{"text":"Fabulous!!!! What a gem, great burgers, clean, giant jenga game and awesome patio!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars in Cleveland. Great relaxed atmosphere, good beer selection, burgers and prices."}
{"text":"In town for a couple of sporting events so we hit downtown to find a drink.  I'm talking 3pm on a Wednesday after noon and every spot was wall to wall packed!  What gives?? 
Finally found a couple of bar stools here and the waitress explained that most of the places down there are not open for lunch. But decided to do it that day, during the holiday season to give it a shot.  Score for the owner!!   Must have been a success!
    We didn't order any food so I can't review that.   Hubby liked the beer selection.  Lots of choices.  I ordered a bloody mary. Doesn't come close to being one of my favorites by far but then again, as you've read in my other reviews, I'm very picky about my Bloody Marys.  
The staff was ok. Meh. By no means what I would consider \"Friendly\" but certainly not rude. 
It was ok for a downtown spot. But not something that I'll miss or make my way back to."}
{"text":"The Pros: The food is really good when you're in the mood for bar fare. Personal favorites are the hot pretzel, buffalo nuggets, spicy burger and veggie burger. Never had any issues with the food when eating at the restaurant. 

Cons: unless you go when they are fairly slow but well staffed (late lunch) the service is pretty subpar. I typically don't let that bother me too much. We order take out from time to time to avoid the service issue-depending on who you get on the phone, it can be fine or the person is distracted and couldn't care. Check your order before you leave even if it's usually always right! Last week we ordered take out and got a totally different burger. The guy on the phone was less than helpful in remedying the situation. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Beer was great and had a lot of selections. Had an everything pretzel which was awesome nothing better than a pretzel with a good beer."}
{"text":"The food I had here last night was awesome and worth the 3 stars alone however the bartender was sooooo bad. She would literally disappear for 15 min at a time to the other side of the bar where there were only like 2 patrons. My favorite part was getting up to get my own food from the pass after it was sitting under the heat lamp for at least 5 minutes no exaggeration. The cook was nice though we gave him 15 percent tip and her 5 percent since she basically did nothing definitely need to refine their service here but food is solid"}
{"text":"Really good beer selection! Tried the fried pickles and sliders. Both were meh - okay. Probably wouldn't order either again. The hummus looked really good though! Liked the atmosphere a lot more than a lot of other places on West 25th. It was more intimate and quaint."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. I also loved the full sized Jenga in the back.  It is better selection than the previous bar, but it is more crowded now"}
{"text":"The food was great had the Burger. It was Excellent!!! Service was excellent!! Place was clean!! Loved the the industrial look of the place!! Would recommend to anyone wanting to hang out and enjoy a burger and a beer!!"}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of Nano Brew for several years. Great beer choices, fantastic patio, and considerably less douchey on Saturday nights than other places on W. 25th. 

However, some of their newer bartenders are just rude. Last night I politely asked one of them (wearing a Notre Dame hat) to turn one of the three TVs to the Alabama-Mississippi St. game on. She said she couldn't because she had to keep the Notre Dame-Miami game on - even though it was halftime and ND was down by 28. 

I went back to her 15 minutes later and again politely asked her to just change one TV to to the Bama game because it was tied with 9 minutes left and there was a group of us wanting to watch. She said her manager said no and oh and they lost the remote. So because she was a Notre Dame fan, the rest of the bar missed the best game of the night and Alabama's game-winning drive. 

Not to mention when I tried to order a drink the rest of the night she avoided me. The other bartenders weren't particularly polite or engaging, either. Not much separating Nano from your everyday frat bar down the street. 

Skip it. There's better service - and better food - elsewhere."}
{"text":"Nano Brew is my favorite bar on W. 25th. It's much bigger than it seems, consisting of three large, separate bar areas and an open back patio. The patios is a fantastic weekend hangout during those hot summer days. Giant jenga is a great way to entertain during the cold winter days inside. Dog-friendly and lots of parking for bikes. Even some tune up tools are stuck to the wall for minor bike repairs. 

They have some great bar grub. There are a lot of interesting burger combinations on the menu that I have never seen before and the menu changes regularly with the specials of the day. I have had a few burgers from here and they are tasty. Definitely a favorite while drinking. 

They also have a good selection of beers to go around. Like many bars, the beers sometimes go through a rotation, so you won't always see the same brews being served. My favorite thing? They have a lot of bartenders out. More than any other bar I've seen. I feel like I get served more quickly than any of the other W. 25th bars, and that's a huge plus for impatient-me."}
{"text":"Awesome experience! After a disappointing experience at a nearby bar we rolled in here for some brews. They had a great beer selection coupled with outstanding service. Not only were we greeted by our server of course but two managers checked in and talked with us as well. We felt taken care of and the beer was great! We'll have to try their food next time as we heard the burgers are tasty!"}
{"text":"Visited Nano Brew once again on a recent bar crawl in Ohio City with a group of friends.  We sat on the patio and ordered some beer and food.  The beer was great, as usual.  We ordered the mac n cheese balls again, and I ordered the Philly steak sandwich.  The food was served pretty quickly and it was tasty.  I tried some fried pickles, which were delicious.  My Philly steak sandwhich was just okay.  The beef was seasoned well, but there wasn't enough of it.  I know authentic Philly cheese steaks DO come wit Cheese Wiz or wit out it, and this Philly is true to that heritage.  However, I don't really like Cheese Wiz and I love mushrooms, onions, and peppers.  Wish this sandwich had a different cheese and more veggies.  Otherwise, pretty good.  I really don't like their wafer fries, as they're hard/crispy.  I prefer my wafer fries hot and soft.  I think the fries missed the mark.

The beer is excellent, the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"I checked this place out this past Sunday with some friends. We had some drinks and ordered some food, and it didn't really make an impression on me. The food was just okay, and the atmosphere hasn't changed enough from when it was the Garage Bar to feel any different. 

I ordered the Spicy burger with the falafel patty. I'm not sure why it's called a falafel patty, as it really didn't taste or feel like a falafel (soggy and wet and bland, not crispy and firm and flavorful). I was happy that I ordered the spicy version of the burger, because without the subtle spiciness of the peppers on the sandwich, it would have been pretty bland and flavorless. My meat-eating friends seemed to enjoy their burgers, for what it's worth. The waffle fries were good, but nothing to rave about...

All in all, I definitely wouldn't put this too high on any list of places to visit in Ohio City, with all the other great options available."}
{"text":"We've been to Nano Brew a few times since its opening, and been duly impressed.  After reading the reviews that have been posted, I have to ask the question, what are people expecting?

Nano Brew has a small selection of their own beers, paired with a selection of unique drafts and bottles.  This is not Harbor Inn, or any other establishment that attempts to wow you with 100+ selections.  The beers are meant for those who appreciate a particular taste or style. I appreciate this, and have been happy with the selections I've chosen.

If you go to Nano Brew, you MUST try the PB&J burger.  Natural peanut butter with bacon jam on a burger.  I didn't know what to expect, but HEAVEN is what I got!  I'm not sure I'll ever order anything else as long as it's on the menu.  It's that good.

On the down side, I've only been ton Nano Brew during cooler weather, and the seating is lacking.  It's been a struggle to find seating on most weeknights, and we've left without being seated before.  I assume that the outdoor seating area will help when the weather warms up, and if it's as nice as it looks, it'll be a regular part of our rotation."}
{"text":"Great beer brewed ten feet from the bar. Great service with very friendly staff. The menu is eclectic and fun. Glad I stopped in Ohio City to check it out and I'll definitely be back to try the The Dawg Pound."}
{"text":"Suggested by friends who live in the neighborhood for a group meeting place on a recent visit home to Cleveland, Nano is great!  There's a huge list of beers - some actually made right there.  We didn't eat, but the menu looked incredible also.  Special note that the music was perfect also - lots of great rock music!  The artwork and interior are complete stand outs also.  We had plenty of room for about 15-20 friends who came to meet us and the staff were great and very knowledgeable about the menu.

To the lady who reduced stars because she couldn't bring her kid - um - duh.  Its a bar.  Please don't ruin it for the rest of us by bringing your screaming brat, thanks!  This isn't a place for kids - its a place for adults with sophisticated taste."}
{"text":"Just left there.  Food was over cooked. Service was horrible. last time we will eat here!"}
{"text":"I am glad that the Garage Bar closed. Thank the Demiurge that it closed and Nano Brew replaced it. I congratulate the staff on dealing with the customers that I saw up there tonight. A lady ordered a Pumpking. It came in a snifter. She goes \"Is that the pumpkin one? Oh that's different\" because it was served in that glass. Actually lady, that is pretty standard for fancy beers. A kind barmaid asked if she needed help after she already ordered and she replied \"I'm fine\" when in all reality, she was lying. The guy next to me ordered a burger. He asked the bartender if the cook was professional. He complained that the meat was too salty and said he was unimpressed. He ate most of it and asked for a free beer in exchange. After witnessing both of these people, I decided that I needed to leave so I wouldn't get too disappointed with the way that the human race has turned out. I didn't last as a bartender for long because when I had customers like these, I would tell them how things were. It is not easy to look a person who is dead wrong in the eye, and tell them they are right. If I was working tonight at Nano Brew, I would have been fired for throwing a hamburger at a customer. I will return to Nano Brew. Hopefully on a night when it is not busy. As I remain on Desolation Row and search for the Sad Eyed Lady of the Low Lands, I realize that To Live is to Fly and that we are all Waitin' Around to Die."}
{"text":"Very good beer and very good service. Could really use heaters outside! It was a cold day outside. Really nice patio. Beer sampler is a really good deal."}
{"text":"Solid little brew pub (or dare I say nano sized XD) right outside downtown Cleveland and not far from Great Lakes Brewery, I tried three of the beers, I cant remember the exact names but they were all pale ales and good, we got 3 apps for the table-mac n cheese balls, fried pickles and loaded fries, all very good, the pickles were a little different than I normally see them served but not a big deal, it was a good spot to end the night at"}
{"text":"Good food, lousy service. 

I went here with my friends during the Market Fest, so I understand that they were busy that day. However, for a new establishment, you'd think they would still be trying to impress people. We had two servers that day and neither of them impressed me.
This bar is competing with too many other establishments to get away with having such rude, sarcastic servers."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. Visiting from out of town and popped into this brewery to grab a burger. Got a seat immediately... took us a while to get our drink order in but eventually did. Took another ten minutes to get our order in but it was a Saturday so I didn't think much of it. Long story short, we waited exactly 59 minutes and still didn't have our food. I got so fed up I made everyone walk out. The waiter came to our table each time promising he would check on the food. Never seemed apologetic but actually annoyed that I was asking where my food was. There were three of us. We each ordered a burger with fries. There is absolutely no reason that it should take 59 minutes plus to even get a burger out. Especially when  there was large group of people across from us who got their food and left before we even got our food. Do not recommend this place and would never step food in this place ever again!!"}
{"text":"Pretty average overall. I stopped a few times in over the summer and really enjoyed the patio and beer selection. Wasn't really a fan of the beers made onsite, but liked the selection of additional drafts. 

Have been there a few times since winter set in and really had lacking service and really mediocre food. Decore isn't anything special and honestly feels a little sparse for the size of the space. The whole bike theme seems a little hokey to me and doesn't feel genuine."}
{"text":"This is another great bar to go to on 25th street. I always love the atmosphere especially if you can sit out on the back patio. It is a gorgeous spot. The food is okay. Generally, I go here for the drinks.

I also learned recently that each week Nano releases a new beer on Thursday. The beer is a tester that allows the Brewers to test out a new recipe. It is only about half a keg so it is gone by Saturday. So, if you easily get bored with the beers and want to try something unique this would be where I suggest going."}
{"text":"Really? Gonna cook my burger well done without an option? That's a disgrace to the animal. Terrible burger. Beer flights and fried pickles saved the experience. People who think this is a good burger...idk what to tell ya"}
{"text":"With a great list of local draft beers anda list of burgers that looked insane, Nano should be a solid stop on your beer tour of the Cleveland brewery district. I was impressed with the constantly updating list, which they keep up to date with a ladder and some small chalk boards.

I had a good seat facing the kitchen and saw loads of amazing looking burgers going out to the tables. It was a well organized ballet, but I wanted to get another beer at another place and so I moved on.

Neat vibe, very friendly, great looking food. Welcome to Nano Brew!"}
{"text":"The beer is good but the service is consistently terrible. When they are busy, the bartenders ignore you and they are slow they are uninterested. We have been here several times and always leave disappointed or without being served at all!  It is a shame because this place has potential."}
{"text":"This place was okay.  Beer was good, specifically the Rye IPA.
The bartenders seemed like they wanted to be somewhere else and annoyed with anything we asked."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices and a great setting. I really like having the sandwiches on pretzel bread. They have a good amount of vegetarian options as well. Their outdoor seating area is awesome! The beer options cover all tastes and is pet friendly outside!"}
{"text":"As a frequent customer, I was particularly disappointed in this visit. We had a party of 17 for a friends birthday brunch. We were greeted by the host and was told that the service was going to be slow for our group (which is totally unacceptable). After being seated the server was slow in everything she did. Our guests had to go to the bar to order drinks because we were waiting so long. Once we ordered, our food came out staggered. With 2 of our party ordering wake n bake burgers and 3 with biscuits and gravy, we were all very disappointed to find out that the biscuits were rock solid. The 3 that ordered the biscuits and gravy could not eat. The 2 of those had undercooked eggs and one had over cooked eggs. After finishing our table was not bussed until we were about to leave. As a customer service industry professional the service and food was an absolute fail in my eyes. I am embarrassed for the restaurant and its employees that they aren't being held to a high standard like most Ohio city establishments are. I hope that this improves so that no one else has to experience this like we did."}
{"text":"This place is ok with me because the Garage bar was a horrible place. People started a trend of bringing their animals there, I do not believe bars are a place for animals. If I ever stepped on s*** due to a drunk customer with their dog, I would flip my lid. At the time my buddy had a cool ass dog and he took him, although, his dog was good I still disagree.

As far as the bar, always a nice crowd, no punks, cool atmosphere. I have not eaten the food, but hear its good. Beer selection and prices are decent. I have noticed a trend of waiting on drinks for no good reason though. Empty or packed, maybe it's just me, maybe I look like a person not to serve. I dont know? They definitely have a good location, it's more of a one and done for me, peep the scene and be on my way. 

Nothing bad to say though, will update once I grub here..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer, checking out the scene. Nice. Loud, but we can easily talk. Sitting at the bar on the \"other side.\" Good chocolate porter. Enjoying the weekly Nano brew introduced every Thursday. Today is Nano, the Big Juicy."}
{"text":"Nano Brew is obviously known for their beer, however, I know them best for their food. They have such an underrated brunch. It's absolutely amazing. And their burgers are THE best (try the acid trip). Hangover fries, amazing. Donut holes, delicious. I've never had anything bad there. Also love their patio in the summer. Such a great spot. Oh and also, they are great for take out! Love the falafel wrap. Wowza, truly a winner in my books."}
{"text":"*sigh*

If I've told you once, I've told you twice, please leave the hipster-wannabe waiters at the door. You may think the 'I'm too cool for you' attitude is serving your image, but it's not serving me, and that will not get you a good tip.

The only reason this place is getting two stars is because 2 out of our party of 4 enjoyed their meal. The night started off on the wrong food when the waiter rolled her eyes when my husband asked her a question about the beer list. She was clearly not interested in answering his question because she had another table to attend to... I don't know, maybe they were hipsters rock-stars from some reality show, but she was DYING to beat feet to make it over there. It could also be that upon further questioning when she did come back, she had no idea about any of the beers.

Let me be clear: If you are working for a place called Nano Brew, you need to understand beer.

Moving on...

My burger was burn-your-face-off spicy hot. I had asked her if it would be hot, and she said no. Really? Really.

After waiting for an eternity to get checks and a refill, ya know, because the skin was melting off my face from the burger, we noticed that our check was off. We were overcharged by 50 cents on a beer. Big deal? Not really. But when we politely asked our waitress about it she said, 'oh, it's only off by 50 cents' and walked away. She didn't bother to fix it or apologize. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Will 50 cents break the bank? Do I care that much about 50 cents? No, but I care that you DON'T care.

Never again, Nano Brew, never again."}
{"text":"Helloooooo new McNulty restaurant!  

The brothers took over the Garage bar and have turned it into a clean, bike-centric, beer-centric and burger-centric restaurant.  Gone are the kitchy walls and the fire pit, but well...it still feels like the Garage bar mixed with a little Market Garden Brewery.

Walking around, the floors are new, there are plenty of picnic tables to choose from, a great side patio, and the reviews from the food around me were all very good!  I'm also happy that they still have a beer fridge and I can get my PBRs without a problem.  

But, did I mention it still feels like the Garage bar?

I'm  hoping they put things up on the walls and do some more decorating.  The whole place just feels too minimalist and empty.  I miss those car-hoods and Shell signs!  Now, I'm all for a clean feel but just bare walls are boring.  Plus I'm sure I'll be missing that smoker-hut/fire pit this fall when the Garage bar was the obvious - go to - patio on a brisk October day.  

Overall, I'm glad they opened it quickly, but it just doesn't quite feel different enough for me?  I'll obviously be back though."}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum. 

The first time I tried NB, it was right after it opened. We sat outside on the little side patio and ended up dogsitting Sam McNulty's dog while he tended business inside. Fine by me - eternal dog lover... and his dog was damn cute. I had the spicy burger and loaded fries of some sort with chorizo. The boy had the sliders. There is something about the buns they use... they melt in your mouth and don't take over the taste of the actual burger and toppings. Amazing. Also to note - the back patio also looks incredible. 

The boy and I went for a quick dinner last night again and sat at the bar. This place really is very cool. I love that they played up the cycling. For the most part, the staff seems to be really attentive and friendly. I have a feeling the bartender last night was a bit off. You could tell he was making a concerted effort to be friendly... but he seemed annoyed in general. I don't think with us... but I felt bad for bothering him with my requests as much as he tried to smile and accommodate us. To note: I ordered the same burger and it was still amazing. Best burger in OC. I also ordered the pumpkin kibbe - fried pumpkin dough stuffed with chorizo and cheddar and topped with a cayenne honey. OMG! Who thought of that combo?! Bomb.com"}
{"text":"Pbj burger with peanut butter and bacon jam. Need I say more. The burger was cooked to order, medium. Very tasty. Bacon jam had a spicy kick to it. I like it. Could put more fries in the basket. Washed it down with Breckinridge vanilla porter. Ill be back here soon. Ohio city is doing it right these days.  I'm so old I remember the days of the project folk beating the hell out of each other or trading crack on 25th.  Now its a YP/Empty Nester, I have an imported car look at me, this neighborhood is cooler than the suburbs and I'm not afraid to hang out in a more urban setting kind of feel to it.  And that's a good thing.  Hail Cleveland..."}
{"text":"We had to check out this new bar when we came into town for the holidays.  Sam McNulty is buying up this whole street!!  But in his typical fashion, the beers here are yummy and the decor is cool."}
{"text":"Really cute spot. There are a few breweries in Ohio City but I decided to check Nano out because of the decor. Lime green accents, and bikes in the window. I tried the Amber and the Mac and Cheese balls. Wish the mac was a bit cheesier but it was still good."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night with my posse. The crowd was hype and not douche baggy. The patio was spacious with plenty of seating. Only problem was that it took at least 20 minutes of waiting to get a drink. Ended up going across the street. Decor was cute, clean and trendy. Nano Brew, I will be back to taste you when the lines permit. I love a good craft beer and my fellow beer aficionados are singing your praises."}
{"text":"I have yet to meet a dish that I didn't like. Only reason I can't give a 5 star because the service gets sketchy. We dined for brunch and the food was great as always.  The server was not! He had a piss poor attitude and not very engaging. We had to ask the hostess for butter for our pancakes.  She even had to refill our waters.  We ultimately asked if we could tip her since she was the one attentive during our time! Overall a great place for brunch and late night food.  Just beware that your service want be great but your food will!"}
