{"text":"My friends and I all wanted to give this place a try as it's a bit unique for the state street dining scene. We were largely not disappointed. They had a special going on with a free ad-on (sausage, corn, or potatoes) and $20 for a whole lobster. I obliged on both fronts and was very satisfied. 

My friends tried some of the other things: shrimp, mussels, snow crab, Cajun fries, chicken tenders, etc and all were good to very good. I do think going for the second level of spice has the best overall flavor. And that's coming from a dude who likes his heat.

This place is better than the reviews indicate. Service and atmosphere are more than adequate and the food is tasty. The only complaint would be the price, but for fresh seafood in Madison, it's to be expected."}
{"text":"I really like the concept of mad seafood boiler, but I think it could be better.  It used to be that you'd get to pick your sauce, pick your seafood, and they'd deliver it all in a bag and you'd just dig in and it was really casual.  Now they serve everything on a large platter.  The flavors are overall okay. I really like the \"everything sauce\" where they mix the garlic and butter and lemon and cajun all together.  I think that the sauce is inconsistent though, sometimes \"fire\" is super spicy, sometimes it tastes mild.  Overall though, really fun place to go with a group, and food is yummy.  Also, their corn used to be super good and super sweet, but now it's just okay."}
{"text":"I ordered the crab, and when I got it 30 minutes later, it was still frozen inside...and they weren't even busy for it to take that long. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The decor is pretty cool but it seemed like they were in a rush to open this place because it could still use some work. The Cajun flavour is the best! I highly recommend!!! They had really good crawfish as well and Shrimp! It can be pricey but it was sooo delicious! Their Cajun fries are delicious! I will definitely be back! The overall experience was pretty nice, it was kind of hard to understand the waitress but we figured it out. The only thing that sucks is that almost everything on the menu is market priced so it'd be good to ask before you order. Anyway, this place had good food. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Needs work,  a lot of work. The atmosphere here is fine, and relatively upgraded to other crab boils. Big, spacious area with a lot of seating. Service was courteous and timely. No where to easily wash your hands after getting messy from such an involved meal - gotta go to the bathroom.

They have been open a few weeks now, but, they don't serve alcohol yet.

I had a pound of shrimp and pound of king crab in a mild, all three sauce, combination. Added corn and andouille sausage. Add ons for any of the bags are 2 dollars a pop. A little disappointing - corn is 5 ears for 2 bucks at the grocery store, come on! 

The meat was cooked perfectly. The sauce was awful. First of all, the base seemed not have butter, it is some other oil. Spices were absolutely off. I tasted no Cajun, lemon, or pepper. I think there was even some asian influence playing a role in the sauce - that is okay if it is, but, please call it what it is if you are going to change up the recipe. Though the meat was cooked perfectly, multiple dips into the sauce made me lose morale and hope that my spot would be hit. Every bite made me feel more and more nauseated. At a place like this, people really are searching for that flavor explosion - you wont get that here, sorry.

This restaurant is still in their infancy. I think the smartest thing they could do at this time is fix their sauces while there is a chance for revival."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Mad seafood boiler,had the combo B with all 3 seasonings at a medium spice level, did I like it? Well my waitress Sansa ask if I needed a spoon when she caught me drinking  from the dish, yes it was good and my sodas were always kept full! Messy but delicious, I found the Crawfish useless but I'll definitely be back to try another combo"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Went here with some friends from Baltimore that got some crab legs and they said it was delicious. I got crawfish; it was also very yummy. The price is up there but it's *fair* considering that we are in the Midwest and this the first (primarily) shellfish restaurant there is in Madison. You can taste that the shellfish isn't \"we bought this today from the docks\" fresh but it's by no means not worth a visit. Worth the trip, food is amazing, seasoning works well. 

Only problem I had was that the service was relatively slow; however it just opened so I'm sure they'll get better with time to come. One thing that I noticed is that there seemed to be no bussers, that would probably help the wait staff attend more responsively and just have someone focus on clearing the tables, since it is quite a mess when a group leaves."}
{"text":"Seems like a nice place. Food was good, not great. Had ala cartel Sushi. Wasabi roll was very good. Yellowtail tuna very good. 
Sushi rice was too chewy. The regular tuna maki literally had no discernible taste! It could have been tofu. 
I will say the ginger was tremendous! 
I'd go again......I guess."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite seafood
Outing since my tour de Madison has commenced. The food was great and filling. I wish they had a full bar but the options are endless."}
{"text":"It tasted really good. Spices used were very yummy. However, much like the other reviews, digging your dinner out of a boiling bag of seafood using on plastic gloves was a bad idea. They don't even give you a fork. It was terribly uncomfortable. I normally don't have a problem eating food with my hands (BBQ, Pizza, etc), but when it's covered in steaming hot wet spices it becomes a terrible idea."}
{"text":"Update:  Less than a week later and came back. Even better, as less crowded and seafood was steamed a little less. Perfect. 

Don't expect big crawfish, but do expect exceptional flavor. Clams and mussels are excellent.  Suggest three sauce combo option, and spiciness tends to low end of scale so I would suggest if you like medium order hot, and hot order extra hot.  The small combo was still a good deal of food and very satisfying. 

They really should provide a few moist wipes with the meal as you are going to use your hands. Nice to wipe before, during so you can drink your wine/beer, and after. 

Still, a different experience for Madison and very good anywhere. 


Initial Review:

We did not try the sushi, but it did look quite good, the chefs were careful, and the selection very good. This review is about the seafood boiling. 

We would give 4.5 stars as they were a little rigid about having to order by the pound. Would have like to be able to do clams, shrimp, crawfish by the half pound. 

Very friendly and attentive staff. They were happy to explain and make recommendations. 

We ordered a combo and added a lobster tail. You also pick a sauce or try all three combined like we did - awesome if you like garlic.  And you pick how spicy. We went with medium. Probably could have gone hit. They ease up fir the Midwest palate. 

Had heard the seafood was served in a bag, but they stopped that unless you ask for it, as folks in Madison could not get their heads around it. Bag is supposed to keep the food warmer longer. Ours was served in s nice dish. They also have a large discard bucket and plenty of napkins in a well designed dispenser, and you will need them. 

The food was very good, and the sauce excellent.  Clams were small and tender. Crawfish too. Shrimp were clean and flavorful and you can order with heads in or off. Sausage was very good, especially with the sauce. Lobster tail was large and full of sweet meat.  Snow crab was excellent as the sauce/broth permeates the cluster and is awesome. 

The food was cooked almost perfectly. Done but not over done. 

Beer and wine only, but a decent selection of both. 

Good value for the price. A combo easily fed two adults, and I am sure would satisfy a larger appetite. 

Nice addition to the madison food scene. Good to have something different and excellent. 

Casual, and don't wear your good clothes as she'll and sauce will fly!"}
{"text":"Had a very satisfying \"Lupper\" here today. Our \"Combo A\" offered a good spread of tastiness (1/2lb snow crab, 1/2lb shrimp, 1/2lb mussels, a corn cob, some sausage, and 6 or 7 baked potato halves) at a decent price ($21.)  At 3:30pm on a Sunday, the restaurant was quiet and lent the perfect environment for an unplanned \"Hey wanna go find food on state street\" date.

Service was run-of-the-mill, food was flavorful and exciting for a Kansas-born land-lubber, price wasn't bad at all, and the restaurant was comfy. I'm glad we chose to stop by."}
{"text":"WORST SUSHI EVER!!!!!! Terrible service and even worse food (except for the dumplings).The sushi tastes like you are eating plastic. Save yourself and do not go here. You will thank me later!!"}
{"text":"We'd heard that there was a new Cajun restaurant in downtown Madison and wanted to give it a try.  Just a block off of State Street, it's not exactly what we expected.  The menu was posted on the door and we could see people eating through the window.  It's really a seafood boil.  Choose from a variety of seafood options such as crawfish, shrimp with head on, shrimp with head off; mussels, various types of crab, lobster, and clam.  Choose the flavoring: cajun, garlic, lemon pepper, all three.  Choose any add-ons such as corn, sausage, and potato.  They also have a few appetizers such as fries w/cajun seasoning, chicken wings, and fried chicken, fish, and shrimp.  This sounded great to us, so we went inside to give it a try.

The space is bright, airy, clean, and modern.  The tables are covered in paper and they bring you disposable bibs as well as disposable plastic gloves to wear.  There are paper towels at each table, cutlery is at the bar if you want it, and they bring you moist towelettes with your check.

Our waitresses, multiple servers covered our table rather than just one, were all very friendly and happy to answer any questions we might have.

We opted to get one pound of crawfish and one pound of shrimp (head off) in the cajun spice w/sausage and corn on the cob.  We also ordered the Cajun fries to start.  A lot of the prices in the menu are listed as market price, but the prices seemed pretty reasonable overall.

The fries were crispy and crunchy.  I did not find it particularly Cajun flavored, but I did enjoy the seasoning.  When our boil arrived it came double-bagged inside of a bucket.   It was very hot, and with no utensils I was glad of the plastic gloves for the little protection they offered.  It felt like I was burning my fingers trying to pick up pieces of potato. It was also very messy so I was glad of the paper, gloves, and bib.  The shrimp were tasty and we learned quickly to remove the shell and dredge them along the bottom of the bag to pick up all the flavor down there.  The crawfish weren't worth the effort to eat them.  I'd eaten them before in South Carolina and really enjoyed them, but these seemed to require much more effort than I remembered and a very small payoff.  They also seemed to be very little juice in their heads which was disappointing.  We did have potato in our boil although we had not ordered it.  There was just a smattering of sausage and  three pieces of corn.

Overall I really enjoyed the novelty of the seafood boil. It was a unique experience in the Madison area.  The price wasn't bad and we did leave full.  However, it is a lot of work for what you get and it is very messy.  I'll probably go back but not very often."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been on our list and finally we dined in. The staff was very friendly and service was prompt. We started off with an order of crab rangoons. The order of four hot pieces was delicious!  They were filled nicely and were real crab, not imitation. The filling was creamy and rich, a nice change from a clump of cream cheese which you normally get around town. We ordered the small boil with all three spices. It was as enough for two people. The sausage was spicy and the crab was plentiful. Potatoes were fine but the corn was a little mushy. We also ordered the Madison Roll. A sushi roll with crab and avocado which is deep fried. It was served with a spicy mayo and we couldn't get enough of it. It was so big we had several pieces to bring home with us. Glad we tried it out and we would return again and try more menu items."}
{"text":"They did a last-minute seafood boil order for me on Mother's Day. Everything was packaged and ready to load RIGHT ON TIME. Seafood is plump and juicy- they don't short you one bit on the amount of protein. I'm so grateful they're in Madison. Otherwise, I'd be longing for this from the San Diego Boiling Crab establishments."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great seasoning, great atmosphere however, kinda expensive prices. Love the concept. Great service."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a combo platter (Combo B) medium hot with the Everything spice. Thought it was really good and there was more than enough food for both of us. Probably enough for 3 or even 4 if stretching it. I thought the price was very reasonable considering how much you get. Pretty messy eat but well worth it. The space is a little sterile but that didn't bother me too much except when the baby at the booth next to us cried and the sound bounces around."}
{"text":"The service was terrible and the food was not good at all. The food was served in bags with plastic gloves instead of utensils. The lobster tail that I ordered was tough and absolutely covered in heaps of garlic. I couldn't taste anything but garlic. 
Overall, I had a very unpleasant experience at this restaurant and will not be returning."}
{"text":"We have been to the Mad Crab twice now.  Both times, the food was very good, but had way too much garlic.  We both like garlic, but there was more garlic on our table than seafood.  We will give it one more try and not go back if things are the same."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in California! I just moved to Madison several months ago and have been searching for some crab and crawfish boiled, similar to Boiling Crab and Crawdaddy! I have to say this place does not quite compare, but it's definitely not bad! Had it twice already, delivered. I haven't tried their sushi rolls so this rating is based on their Cajun seafood items. 

The seasoning for the combo is not bad, could use a little more kick? Second time ordering the flavor was lacking a bit. The cajun fries are delicious, a must try.  Delivery time was a lot faster than expected. Overall, 4 stars for service/delivery and food. :) Thanks guys! Kind of made me feel like I was back in Cali again. Will definitely try again! 

If you are getting it delivered, make sure you have some lemons at home! Lemon + salt + pepper + Tabasco, great sauce to dip your crab, crawfish, and shrimp in!"}
{"text":"Pretty good price for the seafood. 

I got half a pound of shrimp and half a pound of crawfish. You get a side for free if you order 1 pound or more!"}
{"text":"Went to try their sushi..omg sooooo delicious and the price is really good. They even have oyster shots with raw egg, and the sushi rolls are are all DELICIOUS"}
{"text":"Although the spices here will not blow you away, the prices are reasonable and you will leave satisfied and happy with the meal. I am glad to have this place in Madison. When I lived in LA, I frequently went to Boiling Crab or to the Boiling Crab imitators; this place is not as good, but holds its own.

I tried the all spices on a pound of shrimp and garlic butter on some mussels. Both were pretty good! I recommend you add on sausage, it is really tasty!

Give this place a shot. It does not deserve the low ratings it has gotten! It is NOT traditional, Louisiana-style Cajun food. It is more Asian inspired (you can order white rice or edamame as a side) and is good at what it does."}
{"text":"So this review is based on a delivery order... Mad Seafood Boiler has expanded their menu! They now offer sushi and poke bowls and sushi burritos. We ordered three rolls and a poke bowl. I didn't have super high expectations given the original theme of the restaurant. I was wrong! The sushi and poke bowl was great! Priced fairly too."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and loved the experience. I had the King crab with sausages For the grand opening they do have specials going. I'm interested to see how this restaurant grows in Madison"}
{"text":"We went when the restaurant was open a week.  Service was good.  Food was ok.  It's different that you are served your meal in a plastic bag.  No plates.  It's messy.  We didn't find the flavor all that different between the different options.  Hot was not especially hot.  They were out of the first two options I ordered.  Likely won't go back but it's an interesting experience."}
{"text":"Great food for a great price. My boyfriend and I ate the combo B. Will be one of my favorite places in Madtown."}
{"text":"I'm always skeptical of midwest seafood places but Mad Seafood Boiler was really good. 

The portions were appropriately sized for the pricing. I had one of the combo boils with shrimp, crab, and crayfish in the cajun spice and it was so savory and delicious. It wasn't quite the same as NOLA, but I wasn't disappointed either. 

If you like seafood boils it is worth stopping by!"}
{"text":"Great food and service, we came late and they were accommodating.

Flavor was nice in the seafood combo B. Sushi was fresh and rolls were well made. Good yellowtail sashimi."}
{"text":"Mad Seafood Boiler is the best place to get seafood in Madison. They not only have seafood platters but also sushi and poke bowls. I love their spicy salmon rolls! I love their snow crab legs with the cajun flavor! On your birthday, you can spin this wheel they have and win something. When it was my birthday, I won some Cajun fries! It was so good! I would recommend this place for all seafood lovers."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant for the first time during winter restaurant week.  I think they were a bit overwhelmed.  For the most part the food was good, except for the calamari which was overcooked.  The service was pleasant but confused.  The waiter (who was not our original waiter) brought me the wrong dinner and then asked what I was supposed to get. I couldn't remember the name of the dinner but I didn't think I would have to.  It was a sushi dish that was supposed to come with a tuna roll. I didn't get the tuna roll until after my dessert.  They boxed it up for us.  We'll be willing to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Had Mother's Day dinner here and the seafood combo with garlic sauce was excellent. Everyone was pleased with their meals, service was fast--the servers worked great as a team. And the cheesecake was to die for. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"So, the first thing to understand about Mad Boiling Crab is that it's not cajun food in the style of Louisiana. Mad Boiling Crab's concept is similar to a chain of restaurants that are highly popular in Southern California called The Boiling Crab, opened by Vietnamese immigrants with their own interpretation of cajun food. This is not the same restaurant, but it is the same concept. The New York Times has a nice article about this, published in 2010.  

You order items by the pound, you choose the seasoning, and it gets served to you in plastic bags. Tables are lined with butcher paper, and bibs provided for your seafood feast. The prices are reasonable and comparable to other restaurants with similar concepts. For their Grand Opening special, add-ons to your pound of seafood are free (i.e. corn on the cob, potatoes, sausage, etc)

We ordered a pound of shrimp and a pound of crawfish. The crawfish was not good, and I don't recommend it. The shrimp I enjoyed. We chose the seasoning to be everything, and I wasn't a fan. The garlic seasoning was too heavy on the garlic for my taste. I might come back for the shrimp, but the crawfish made me iffy to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This is a hard review to give because the food was fantastic but the service was terrible. We went as a family of five with 3 children under 10 tonight. The server made it clear she was new so we tried to be patient but she messed up our order, wasn't familiar with her own menu, and forgot to put items in when asked. The kitchen was very slow even though the restaurant wasn't very busy. It took forever just for an order of corn and sausage. We ordered Combo A with the everything seasoning and mild heat for the kids. We got the medium for us with snow crab and sausage. No complaints about food quality or taste. My daughter had miso soup and she loved it. My four year old ate some too. And they shared fried rice. It needed a little soy sauce but it was pretty good nonetheless. I would go again but probably take the food to go."}
{"text":"Yes, this is a copycat of the Boiling Crab style restaurants in California, Vegas, and Texas. No, it is not authentic Cajun. That being said I think it's a great addition to Madison and serves its purpose well; a copycat of the Boiling Crab style restaurants. Just tying to get my point across to all the reviews complaining about its authenticity.  I think the best item on the menu is the headless shrimp option.  I've had it many times now and it's perfectly poached."}
{"text":"Amazing food, beautiful space , great location. Love their new sushi menu . Cant beat their lunch specials ."}
{"text":"Ordered Crawfish and Mussels boiler, fresh and quality seafood (rare in Madison), fun experience trying to eat with hands in plastic gloves. Will come back again."}
{"text":"I am with my mom in the restaurant right now! We got the whole live lobster, 2lb king crab legs, clams, fantail shrimp, Cajun fries. These are in everything sauce and garlic butter sauce. My mom loves them. We are waiting for the snow crab legs! Very nice place and very seafood for Madison. I'll post some photos later!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I've lived in the south for a handful of years. I make Cajun boiled shrimp so unbelievably often. It's probably my favorite food. I love making southern boils. I have even driven hours to Joe's Crab shack just to hit that boil craving when it was too late to go to the Seafood Center. I know my Cajun food. 

I buy the the same medium Gulf shrimp by the pound all the time from the Seafood Center. Mad Crab shorts you by so much shrimp I'm livid. There's no way I got the pound I ordered. It was a half pound or less. The add on corn was 1 cob. The add on potatoes were about 4 medium red potatoes. Three add on sausages was about the average size link you get from the store. The pound of crab was two sets of legs. 

My boyfriend went and picked this up and brought it home. I wasn't expecting a lot as far as a Cajun boil goes after reading the reviews stating this is a SoCal style restaurant. After I saw the menu I got excited. This place is definitely Cajun styled, they just do it badly. I don't hate the spice as much as other reviewers, but what I did hate was the spice level. Don't get me wrong, I love spice, but my boyfriend's dietary restrictions means when we share it needs to be pretty mild. 

No problem they have tiers, right? Hah. No. He ordered the lowest tier of spice and it was almost at my preferred spice level. In other words, it was really hot. Don't give the choice if you're not going to stick to it. 

We got an order of calamari along with the boil. They also threw in some fries. The fries were average. The calamari was just weird. It was closer to bar food than a seafood restaurant. 

If you don't know Cajun food or boils this place will probably appeal to you. Madison certainly doesn't have another restaurant like this. If you're experienced, you'll hate it. I personally will never eat here again simply because I got shorted so much shrimp. $50 not well spent."}
{"text":"I want to help set the record straight by mentioning that this is NOT Louisiana-style cajun food. This is very important so that a lot of people who come here are not severely disappointed by how \"wrong\" or \"off\" the flavors seem! However, if you have had The Boiling Crab in SoCal (and several restaurants based off of that in different states), this is that type of restaurant (Hopefully this helps).

We came in the first couple of weeks of this place opening and there was no line to get in, which was nice. Parking was a bit difficult (but it's state street so what can you expect?). Not having much seafood in Madison, I was pretty excited. I would say the number one negative is that service was slow (but then again, maybe just the kinks of a new restaurant opening?). We tried the fried catfish with fries as an appetizer, cajun fries, shrimp, crawfish, sausage, and potato (the sausage and potato are add ins). We had the medium spice, which wasn't very spicy, but we still enjoyed it.

The fries that came with the fried catfish were disappointing but the fish was crispy and hot. The cajun fries were tasty and I would order it again. The best part of the meal was the shrimp. Large, juicy pieces that soaked up the garlicky flavor. We chose the classic sauce and it was very flavorful and garlicky but VERY unhealthy (you can tell it is all oil). Don't come here if you're looking to diet! The crawfish was alright (frozen, not fresh and prices are a little pricier, but then again, this must be difficult to access in Madison). The sausage was asian-style and pretty tasty and you can't really go wrong with the potatoes. 

Overall, I enjoyed that they kept the theme of bibs and gloves. I would suggest that to improve, they add buckets to dump the shells, but overall, if I'm ever craving anything like this, I wouldn't hesitate to come back."}
{"text":"The seafood at this resturaunt is the furthest thing from cajun, and that is coming from someone with cajun roots who was born and raised in louisiana.  This food is a disgrace, honestly.  Never in my life did i have crawfish boiled with heaps of garlic like is used at this resturaunt.  In fact, nobody back home uses this much garlic in seafood boil.  The amount of garlic used in the fake cajun seasoning is appalling and disgusting, clearly used to hide the off flavors of the unfresh seafood.  nobody uses this much garlic in true cajun dishes, and eating here will make you smell like a piece of garlic the next day.  

unauthentic food, and way more expensive than what its worth.  The lb of crawfish that i ate would be worth no more than $3 back home considering how poorly made it was.  Try again on making cajun food, and maybe consult with an actual louisianian if you want to make \"cajun\" food. This is so typical of the midwest.  never go here, its so inauthentic and gross and overpriced for what you get.  Also, fries cant be cajun.  Dear owners and chefs, do your research before you try cooking food that is out of the scope of your culture and dont misrepresent it with awful flavors like you have these first few weeks of opening.  And remove the word cajun from your marketing, as it is false advertising."}
{"text":"This is pretty much the only place in town you can get a seafood boil. I've had the best of the best in the south and this is probably as good as it will get for Madison. Don't expect fresh seafood because well it's Wisconsin! I thought the prices were kind of expensive, especially if you want to add extra corn or potatoes. 
I went when they first opened and ordered a pound of blue crab and crawfish with the Cajun sauce/spicy and it was delicious. I went again a few weeks later and when I tried to order the same thing again the waitress kindly told me that their Cajun option was now a dry rub instead of sauce. The only seafood boil I'll eat is if it's nice and saucy so I was disappointed they changed it to a dry rub. The 3rd time I went they changed it back to a sauce instead of dry rub (: 
I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of seafood boils."}
{"text":"I like this place. I've tried it three different times and had three different experiences; all great ones.

The first time was the soft opening and there were some great specials. Free potatoes, sausage and corn. What a nice surprise.
The next time -- there was a special on blue crab! Yes! Love Blue Crabs!
The last time -- they had buy one get one for sushi rolls. 

I love all of these specials. The seasoning is great and the seafood comes out HOT. It is definitely messy -- but worth it. 

Tip: Get a bowl of rice to share with one other person. It helps with the spiciness. Add potatoes, sausage and corn to make the meal more filling. If you are able -- always get the shrimp and snow crabs. Totally worth it. Large pieces of shrimp that are easy to peel and the crab does not taste like it was frozen for months and does not have freezer burn, thankfully.

Great for dates and groups. Family friendly. I am sure kids would love this. They also serve alcohol. Huge plus! 

Parking is tricky. Street parking or across the street with HopCat patrons."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this place 5 stars because this is a truly unique place in Madison! Coming from the East Coast I was really craving seafood and especially missing the crab and crawfish that I had over there. The concept is really simple. They steam the seafood and put it into a bag with a whole lotta different spices, toss it all up together and you're good to go. 

I'm so glad that they brought one of these places to Madison because there really has been no good seafood places here at all! That being said, I really enjoyed everything that I had here and they seem pretty friendly. I wish people in Madison would give this a try and not judge it based on being \"not Cajun\" because it isn't! It's more like Asian fusion I would say.

Even though the crawfish is frozen, it still tastes decently good!"}
{"text":"Amazing. The spices and sauces used on our dishes were delicious. The fire, their hottest option, was not as flame-y as I had hoped but still wonderful. We had the snow crab and whole lobster. I was surprised by how much sausage was included in the dish. Also great."}
{"text":"Wife and I are tourists from California passing through madison on a road trip of the midwest.  After a concert at the Overture Theater we were looking for some late night (9:45 PM) Food.  SURPRISE, in the downtown we found a lot of open bars but little in the way of food, weird., I mean where do the drunk UW students get their late night munchies?  They can;t all fit in the gyro place.     But we stumbled in here right before their closing time 10:00.   They graciously welcomed us to sit down and eat even through some of the staff were starting to clean up.   No rushing no attitude, it was nice.  Their wine by the glass selection was acceptable, and we are California wine snobs.   Poke Bowl was big, the ahi fresh and loaded with avocado rice and lettuce.  A bit overdressed but good.   My gumbo was pretty good, not NOLA but real file gumbo.   If I lived here would definitely try the seafood boils, I bet they are great."}
{"text":"Why is it that after a poke bowl, your tummy is always so pleasantly pleased? 

The salmon poke bowl is very fresh tasting with edamame, avocado, cucumber slices, rice and greens. I had mine with poke sauce and would recommend tossing it to enjoy the great tasting sauce before eating your way down to find the yummy sauce!

I also shared a small spicy crab roll with black rice. After reading the story about the health benefits of black rice, I just had to taste it, and it really is good! I'll be looking for this black rice from now on, especially if these health benefits are true!

This is a great place to dine with a variety of items on the menu."}
{"text":"The sushi rolls were good and my seafood combo 1 spicy was wonderful!! I choose crayfish for my 1st time and it was very good. I was told the crab legs were average and they even had chicken tenders and fries. I was surprised with the variety of food!"}
{"text":"I wanted to take my husband somewhere where he could absolutely feast on seafood for his birthday. Somewhere casual. Those kinds of places are few and far between around here. Honestly, I even considered Red Lobster for a hot minute, then the hallelujah chorus started when I remembered Mad Seafood Boiler existed (thanks Yelp search).  

The atmosphere is sort of good. The decor is nice, but still feels casual. The tvs on the wall help that, and also allow you to catch the game while feasting. We arrived around 5:30 on a Friday and it was pretty empty, but it slowly got busier by the time we left. It felt like there were a lot of staff milling about, but service was a little slow at the start. So, the vibe was a little weird at first.

Bonus-there was a birthday wheel where you could win a variety of menu freebies. He won a free beer.

The food was great and at a reasonable price point. Hubby had king crab in garlic butter, no spice and shrimp in cajun butter, medium spice. He loved it all. Said it was cooked perfectly. I had a combo plate with snow crab, shrimp and mussels with everything butter and mild spice (due to spice level recommendations on here). It came with a small piece of corn, about 6 potato halves and surprisingly no sausage (I didn't miss it, so didn't say anything). I had to add hot sauce to the shrimp (mild spice was too mild for me), which was actually good because the vinegar tang added a nice note. The snow crab was a bit overcooked and hard to eat. Mussels and shrimp were perfect. 

I'd happily come back here again if in the mood for this kind of meal. A fun place to celebrate a birthday."}
{"text":"Awesome Vietnamese/Cajun spin off food. Being that my family roots are from New Orleans, the bar is set pretty high with me when it comes to Crawfish/Shrimp/Crab broils. I will say this, they definitely have the Cajun seasoning down! Shrimp, Sausage, Corn, Potatoes, were tender and delicious, however DO NOT ORDER THE BLUE CRAB! It's not worth it, barely any meat and not worth the money. Chicken wings were delicious, and they have free refills on drinks. I would go here when I need to satisfy my Cajun palate. But I will go back to try more seafood in my bag/broil.   Solid 3!"}
{"text":"This sushi made my night!! Love their special rolls my fave is the fire cracker roll! Worth the money one of the new best sushi in town... the owner is super nice too!"}
{"text":"The sushi lunch special is high quality, reasonably priced ($10 for two rolls and soup or salad) and flavorful--the fish is definitely fresh but I was really impressed with how light and airy the sushi rice is--sounds silly but it made a big difference as it didn't weigh down the sushi (or me for that matter). I only did take out for this occasion but I hope to come back for a sit down experience."}
{"text":"LOVED this experience and food! My husband and I each ordered a combo plate and shared so collectively we had shrimp, crab legs, mussels, clams, and crawfish. It was a ton of food! We took home leftovers that will last for at least two more days. We had all of the flavor mixes together and it was wonderful. Very Cajun and garlicky. We tried the lowest spice level and the next level up. The lowest level still packs a kick and the next one up will make your mouth sing for quite a while. We really enjoyed the concept of \"digging in\" with our gloves and bibs. It felt like we were on vacation because the seafood was so good and so plentiful. This place reminds me a lot of a place in Seattle called the Crab Pot - nothing but a good time! Especially for the land-locked Midwest city of Madison, this place is really unique and impressive!"}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant I ever ever been in my life. We felt like a DOG or wild. We received our food in a nasty plastic bag as plate with no fork, nothing just like a dog eating his food. Food is not very good I even couldn't eat it I was sick feeling humillated, offended. I am wondering if the city knows the way they serve the food in a unhealthy plastic bag!!"}
{"text":"Went with three friends & had an absolutely amazing experience! I would recommend this for any couple or group to go and enjoy a great meal amongst friends or family. We ordered two different things to have enough of the things we all enjoy, we all had plenty of food, got full, messy, used the bibs, needed to wash our hands afterwards, plus lick your lips! The food was hot, fresh, & amazing. The spices used and the hotness you desire was spot on, both dishes were ordered different and perfect on flavor and hotness. (Spicy ness) 
The staff was awesome explain g anything we wanted to know, paid attention to detail, was a great experience. 
I would do this again soon real soon, this is gonna become my new goto spot for now on!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Mad Seafood Boiler. There were three of us and we ordered Combo B (with all the sauces and spicy), the eel avocado roll, spicy shrimp roll and shu mai (shrimp dumplings). There was a special for the sushi because we came on a Tuesday - 2 rolls for $6.99. Honestly, it was an awesome deal.
-The rolls were absolutely delicious, I even ordered them for delivery the following Friday because how much I liked them!
-The Shu Mai was also really good. Savory and addicting.
-Combo B was enough for the 3 of us. They bring out gloves and a bib because you have to get a little dirty. Ask for the utensils to help with the crab legs! And I'd also suggest getting some extra rice on the side just so everyone has enough. Spicy wasn't really spicy at all to me, I'd suggest if you can handle spice to just do extra spicy. I wish that the seafood soaked in the flavor a little more, but it was still pretty good!

The service was good and they split our check 3 ways with cards. I'll definitely bring people back here!"}
{"text":"The perfect ending to a perfect day with this sweet find! Mad Seafood in Madison has my favorite finger food by the pound... Crawfish!! And appropriately served in a plastic bag. They were so good, my nose was running and my lips can still feel the burn :-) YUM!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Mad seafood Boiler but I was so very, very disappointed.
Honestly, you'd be better off going to any one of the numerous other restaurants in the area.  I should have known it was going to be not-so-great since there were only 3 other parties there eating on a Saturday night however, I was hopeful...I mean who doesn't like a seafood boil right?  Well, there wasn't much to like about this seafood boil.  The quality of seafood was mediocre, the seasonings were not even remotely Cajun, the sauces were underwhelming, and the andouille sausage was terrible. Oh, and every single appetizer option was fried...literally...Every. Single. Option.  

The only real highlights were that there were numerous seafood options (shrimp [heads on or off], crawfish, 3 types of crab, clams, mussels etc.) and service was pleasant & fast as the place was almost empty.  I will not be back and I don't think this place will be around in 18 months.  Sorry Mad Seafood Boiler..."}
{"text":"T R's review is spot-on. This place is in the style of the SoCal crab boil restaurants. It isn't (and doesn't claim to be) an authentic low-country cajun crab joint, so stop ragging on them for it. It isn't quite up to the standards set in SoCal, but it is a respectable attempt and welcomed in an area devoid of this dining style."}
{"text":"Fast service! We reserved a table for a group of 6 and ended up with just 4 of us but the place had no issues with the changes. Water was brought right up after we sat down which was great. We then ordered the food and the sushi and the appetizers showed up first within 15 min and then the seafood combinations came up after another 10 min. Fast Service for sure. All of the food tasted Fresh and just the right seasoning. 

As for the seafood, we only wished they came in a bag with the sauce to keep everything warm instead of having it in a bowl.

As for parking, there is a paying parking lot across the street"}
{"text":"Service was very slow. Food was barely warm but ok taste. Sushi was not up to  par. We had the $34 dish and sushi for appetizer but the sushi came after the main dish. The restaurant was not busy at 5pm Saturday. Staff just talking to themselves. I would not recommend to go there."}
{"text":"I thought the proper name of this place was MAD BOILING CRAB. It is located in the former AJ Bombers space. Seafood, seafood, seafood is what they serve! And in plastic bags for the most part. Dan wanted to try their whole Maine lobster. And at $19.99/lb, we were all 3 game to try. (Market rates are listed at each table.) The server informed us that the Maine lobster which ranged from 1.25 lb. to 1.50 lb. We all chose garlic butter, no spice, and either potatoes or corn-on-the-cob. 
True to rumour, our meals arrived double bagged! Luckily we were also given plastic bibs and gloves, plus each table had a big roll of paper napkins (all very  necessary). None of us had ever eaten \"pre-buttered\" lobster before....it was challenging to hold and crack! We appreciated the server's suggestion to place one side of a cracker on the table in order to use leverage to crack the claws...it works. It was an adventure for sure. But the lobster DID hit the spot. Now that we tried it the restaurant's way, we may be bold enough to ask for butter on the side next time!"}
{"text":"The experience and fun is great and definitely a great addition to Madison's food scene. However this place needs a little work. The Calamari was terrible we took one bite and it was soo rubbery we had to send it back. The Cajun fries were good however they got soggy really quick. We got a head on shrimp boil medium with all 3 spices that was really good definitely get that! We also got king and snow crab boil with the garlic butter with sausage mild...it was just as spicy as the medium but still good. They use oil I think instead of butter which gave it a lack of flavor. Also the potatoes in the boils were not cooked all the way. If they sliced their potatoes a little smaller and then work a little bit more on their spicing and flavor issues this place would get 5 stars!"}
