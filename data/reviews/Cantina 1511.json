{"text":"Prices are reasonable.  Atmosphere is nice.  Chips and salsa is fantastic.  The portions are HUGE and the food is delicious! I will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Food is ok, questionable management brooms and dust pans left out near patrons tables. Very unusual manager and wait staff just walk by it, I guess I'm glad there isn't a mop bucket or toilet plunger..."}
{"text":"5 stars all the way! I've dined at this location dozens of times and I am always fully satisfied. Try the street platter appetizer. The components vary day to day but it's normally a winner. Also, I am a huge fan of every single taco on the menu. Not crazy about the crab guacamole but what do you expect. Definitely one of my  favorite locations in the area!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Great food - guacamole, shredded pork tacos even just their chips and salsa are amazing.  The atmosphere is modern, comfortable and appealing. One of the best things I've tried at Cantina is their margaritas - absolutely delcicious and a variety to choose from. The only reason I'm not giving them a five is the prices. The fantastic margaritas I mentioned come at a hefty price - to the tune of $40-50/pitcher. So, as good as they taste, your buzz is killed when the check comes. Still, I'd highly recommend this place for a special occasion restaurant or date night with someone you'd like to impress."}
{"text":"This place is so good!  It's delicious, the drinks are great and the staff is very kind.  Love the brisket quesadilla. Go! And ask for Jamal"}
{"text":"I am from Florida and was craving a good Mexican experience after not having a good experience the day before. I went on Yelp again to search for a good Mexican restaurant and this place came up.  We ordered the house margarita, two fish tacos, and one chicken taco. The margaritas  were bigger than we expected (not that I'm complaining). The tacos were freshly made and well seasoned. The side items included were black beans over rice and coleslaw. Both were excellent and fresh.  Our service was great overall. It took a few minutes to get our drink order but the waiter apologized for the wait and was very attentive after."}
{"text":"Came here during the lull of a Sunday. Very friendly bartenders and my food came out extremely quickly. Had a couple house margaritas and the tequila was still decent quality! Prices were pretty average and everything met my expectations. Wish I new the bartenders names but they did a great job working together to make sure I never had an empty drink or was left wanting anything. The chips and salsa were very fresh and the chips were served warm! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the positive - the food is pretty darn good. The steak fajitas were served with a very tasty mix of chargrilled veggies. The Carne Asada was also very good.  However, all the positives were totally negated by the worst service I can ever remember in a restaurant. I would also say the cleanliness of our table was bad but that may be the results of the poor skills of our server.  I will go back and give it another try because the food was that good."}
{"text":"I went for brunch last Sunday - after seeing the wait over at the Flying Biscuit - I am SOOO glad we did!  This was our first visit to their new location. At first, we weren't sure they were open, even though Yelp said they would be - there were few cars and no one visible from just outside the door. We went in anyway and there were only 2 parties in the joint. After just a moment, someone came to the front and seated us in our own section. I was not expecting the 5-star experience we had after that initial feeling of \"should we do this?\"  I didn't see any booths and the place has an open layout - so I can imagine it being noisy as other posters have stated....but at breakfast, it was nice and quiet.... once lunch time started in earnest toward the end of our visit, the kid-noise-level increased. (note - it is never acceptable to allow your child to run around a restaurant screaming.)  It was nearly 10:30, so the server said we could choose either brunch or lunch - and when I indicated brunch - he walked me through some of the specialities on the menu with such passion, I wanted to order everything. I have to go back to try  2 of the recommendations - but this first time, I really wanted Huevos Rancheros. We were given a bowl of chips and salsa and our coffees. Odd mix, but in the spirit of being at a Mexican restaurant on a Sunday morning, it worked.   I loved the huevos rancheros and will have to struggle very hard to order something else on my next visit. If you're not familiar with the dish - it is basically 2 eggs over a quesadilla with black beans. Sounds plain - but chefs will create all sorts of rifs on the sauce, the cheese, the other add-ins, and 1511 does it perfectly. The ranchero sauce was delicious, the black beans were perfectly done.  I can't wait to go back and try the Avocado Bake! And the benedict. If you and I are friends and you want to go one weekend, just let me know!"}
{"text":"After moving to Charlotte, there was one common refrain that I constantly heard: \"You need to go to Cantina 1511.  It is excellent.\"  Well, I went.  And it was far from excellent.  The food itself was good, but it was not outrageously delicious as I had been promised.  The food was just as good as at any standard Mexican restaurant.  Everything else, however, was far different.  Despite having a reservation, we waited for almost an hour to be seated.  There was a huge crowd of people in the waiting area, so the wait was uncomfortable.  Also, the bar was so crowded that it would have been very difficult to get a drink for the wait.  And the huge crowd also magnified the inadequacy of their parking.  The atmosphere was nice, definitely a step up from a standard Mexican restaurant.  However, you pay for that step up, and pay dearly.  Unfortunately, I can't remember any specifics, but everything was expensive.  I doubt anyone could get out for under $15 unless they skipped the drink, appetizers and desert.  The guacamole is allegedly great, but I am not a guac fan, so I passed.  The drinks are also very expensive.  A pitcher of mojito went for north of $60, as I recall.  In summary, the food was good.  I have since gone to a wedding reception that they catered, and it was great.  But the wait and the prices make Cantina a poor choice in my book.  There must be plenty of people that disagree, though, based on how busy it was.  Cantina is a place to see and be seen, not to get good food for reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service. Delicious guac, made fresh at tableside. Will definitely be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. Their guacamole made table side is always a staple along with a fresh margarita to wash it down. They always seem to have at least one nightly special to overwhelm your taste buds. Tonight I had the flash fried tuna tacos with avocado and tomatillo sauce which were amazing. Highly recommend the tacos Marco polo or the barbacoa as well. I always leave with a full belly but never seem to have room for dessert."}
{"text":"I have only been twice and ordered the same thing each time. Each time the food was awesome! Great prices for a quick lunch. The system was down the second time I came in during lunch time and the bar tender at the time handled the messy situation with so much grace and kept a smile on his face the entire time! I forgot his name but he has short brown hair, skinny and kind of tall...   Anyway.. Looking forward to coming back and trying more menu items and I'm sure he drinks here are awesome as well..   Side note: the two times I have been in the bar rags smelled of mildew after the wiping of the counter tops. Something to be mindful of in the future (if staff of management happens to be reading this)  I'll for sure be back for a third time!!   Xo"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte. I love the Mexican barbecue (used to be called barbacoa). The pork is so flavorful! The chips and salsa are very good. I also love the mango margarita."}
{"text":"Okay, this place is one of the best restaurants I've been too. Probably the best tex-mex/mexican food I've ever had. I lived in Charlotte for a year and when my family came back to visit, this was the first place we ate dinner. The service is really good and the food is amazing. I had the enchiladas suizias, and they were amazing! You actually get a lot of food for the price. You will not go home hungry. But, if you do have room dessert, you have to try one of them. Nutella pie is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. Super nice inside, great service. Loved the food! Had a Marco Polo taco (sooo good!!) and a grilled mushroom taco, also so good! Overall great food, clean and nice. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"In the last year in a half, I've noticed a marked decrease in quality at both the Dilworth and Stonecrest restaurants.  At Stonecrest, our cold sides for fajitas were put under a heat lamp and the lettuce was all burnt.  Who does that???  The other thing I noticed, at both locations, they prepped the plates way in advance of the main dish and stuck it under a heat lamp until the main dish was ready.  The top of my beans were singed.  This is on more than one occasion, too.  The heat lamp appears to be akin to a microwave in a bad restaurant here.  In Europe, they bring each dish out when it's ready so no heat lamp is necessary.  I wish we'd be more like that in the US rather than trying to hold up dishes to serve altogether.  It rarely works.  Someone's dish is going to be subpar doing it that way.  The last time we ate there, so many things were wrong, we complained to the mgr.  We are generally not complainers.  I will say the management made it right.  They comp'd the entire meal.  However, we've struggled to have the desire to go back - we even have a 50% off coupon to use!!!   At Dilworth, the wattage in the pendant lighting was so bright we were squinting the entire time (not joking.)  We even sent an \"anonymous text message to the manager\" about it.  It was horrible.  Also, the music was so loud, we were practically screaming at each other.  Restaurants, please, if you have to scream to hear yourselves talk to each other, the music is TOO LOUD!  I'm not an old fuddyduddy.  I enjoy some good ambient music, too, but it's not a freaking disco!  It's too bad the quality of the food and atmosphere has decreased.  It used to be my favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  Now the desire to return escapes me."}
{"text":"This was our first time in Charlotte and a friend suggested this restaurant. We made reservations but were still subjected to a 30 minute wait. The management MORE than redeemed themselves with their excellent service and attention to us.   The food was soooo good! Fresh guacamole made right in front of you and the BEST queso we had ever had. Fajita's were great, too, with huge proportions. Some items (like the guacamole) were a little expensive but really worth it. Huge menu as well!  We are so sad that there is not a Cantina near us but are already looking forward to our next trip to Charlotte."}
{"text":"My family came in town and we called ahead to make sure we had a table. When we arrived we found that another family lied and said they were the ones that called ahead. The staff quickly got us one of their private rooms pulled together and had us seated. Honest people: 1 Liars: 0. The food was ridiculously amazing. Everything from the at the table guacamole with bacon and jalapeños to ever entree was dilicious. Our waiter Stan M. #1107 (this guy needs a promotion) was very courteous, funny and had an all around approachable and comical personality that made us feel at home. We all left full, happy and the trip made our evening. Will most definitely be going back for more of their dilicious food!"}
{"text":"Something changed when they moved from East blvd. I used to love this place but in the last 6 months I've eaten here twice and both times have been terrible. Their service has gone way down, and even worse than that the food and margaritas aren't good anymore. The house mix has gotten way too sweet and the drinks aren't consistent. You can order the same drink twice and each drink tastes different and could come in a different glass.  The food use to be good. Marco Polo was a big favorite of mine. The last two times I had this dish it was not good. The shrimp was rubbery and tasted gooey ... Not good.  I spoke with the floor manager last time but he just brushed off my comments and said, \"we haven't changed anything.\"  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I live near this place and have been here several times.  It's not the best Mexican food in town, but its consistently good.  I've had the enchiladas with red sauce and all the tacos. The fish tacos aren't amazing, but are decent.  The chicken is good as is the pork.  Other people at my table had the fajitas and burritos and everyone left happy.  We got the table-side guacamole too and that was pretty good.  The margaritas are good quality even with the house tequila.  So overall its somewhere around a 3 or 4.  I gave it a 4 just because I feel its better than average. I don't think you'll be overwhelmed, but not disappointed either.  Its fine for kids and groups.  May be a wait on weekends as lots of people go here pre-movie theater."}
{"text":"Good service and meals- have eaten here multiple times"}
{"text":"Try to get a table outside on Friday or Saturday night - excellent service - their manager ( sorry dint know his name) is really a great host and is very attentive. Order their Marco Polo tacos - and some margaritas - excellent food , great staff and music is a bug plus."}
{"text":"In my opinion this is the best Mexican sit down place in Charlotte. My favorite item to order are the fish tacos on soft corn tortillas. The fish is fried crispy and the chipotle sauce gives it some nice flavor. Their margaritas are pretty nice as well. They are a little on the weak side but they taste great. The restaurant decor is fun and funky. The music is loud enough to feel fun but not too loud to have a conversation. The service has always been excellent, even on busy nights."}
{"text":"of all frank scibelli's culinary magnets in charlotte, this is my favorite.  cantina 1511 is a really fun place to eat.  an extensive drink menu, colorful décor, and an eye-catching wall mural of \"gone with the wind\" in spanish all make for an eclectic mix of quirky and predictable.  the food is reliably good, and it's not your average mexicamerican masquerading as latin american cuisine.  the utilization of atypical spices, sauces, pickles, and other unusual accoutrements showcase the chef's savvy.  this is definitely not your middling shredded meat, rice, and beans dinner.  the \"top shelf\" guacamole is great, and i'm a fool for the tacos.  i usually mix and match them to my heart's content.  the milanese and the roasted chicken tacos are especially cross-eyed inducing.  i eat here relatively frequently, and i've had the occasional bummer server, but they are few-and-far-between.  if there ever is a problem, i notice that the manager takes care of it quite quickly.  on a sour note, i brought a vegan friend here, and chicken mysteriously wound up in her meal after we sent it back to the kitchen on three separate occasions.  the manager was very apologetic, but i was extremely frustrated to see such a simple error occur multiple times in succession.  parking sucks here on the weekend, but if you can get over having to look for a spot or fork over the money for valet, you're definitely in for a night of good fun and wonderful food.  if you're not disgustingly full after dinner, please try the desserts.  the chef's variation of tres leches is delicious and very shareable.  hat's off for the umpteenth time, maestro scibelli."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my favorite meal during a busy Friday night. I was most impressed by the bar staff as I ordered and when there was a small issue with the meal it was taken care of immediately & recognized by the wait staff and I never said a word. Impressive attention to detail and great customer service!"}
{"text":"Cantina 1511 receives only 2 stars from me.  It's not just the food.  The food is decent.  For me, it's the price.  I think Cantina 1511 is ridiculously expensive, given the quality of the food!  Again, the food isn't bad though.  It's just average.  Let me give you an example.  I went there to eat with my wife and two kids.  The kids are under 10 years old.  We ordered some guacamole for appetizer, I had a beer, my wife had a mixed drink, the kids had lemonade.  One of the kids had one taco, the other had the quesadilla appetizer for dinner.  My wife and I each had a regular entree.  The bill was $71!  I can think of a lot of better meals we all could have had for $71!  This is the second time I have been to Cantina 1511.  Friends of mine seem to really like the place.  Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I don't like Mexican food all that much, but I've been here twice, both times I cleaned my plate, and I plan on going back.    I have had a taco and a burrito, and both were very good--fresh, well-seasoned, and nice presentation.    The ambiance is good, and it always seems to be busy (a good sign for a restaurant)."}
{"text":"I drove 10 miles to get to this place because I heard John Hancock, on News Talk 1110 WBT Radio, rhapsodize about how good it was, and how he took all his out-of-town guests there. I guess he gets paid to say it. Because he either doesn't care much for his out-of-town friends, and wants to hurt them, or doesn't have any out-of-town friends left. I got the ribs - you could have made shoes from the leather; they added two tablespoons of coleslaw, a tablespoon of corn, and a scoop of potato salad, and called it something Mexican.  They noticed I left two of the three charred ribs on the plate when I asked for the check ($25,00 with a draft beer to wash away the taste) and they asked if I wanted a doggy-bag.  I said, \"No, I like my dog.\""}
{"text":"Everything tastes prefab.  I want impressed with the wait staff either.  Not a great place to go for your birthday."}
{"text":"Awful service. My wife and I used to come here for lunch once or twice a month a few years ago and the service was better. Now we have been back twice recently and both times (different servers) were frustrating to say the least. The first time was last week- my mother in law's wine took about 20 minutes to get to us despite the waitress saying there were no customers at the bar. The queso dip we ordered also took about 20-25 minutes to get to our table. Only one person received water at our table. Our entrees took an abnormally long time to get to us. I understand it's not necessarily the waitress' fault but she made excuses for everything and long drawn out ones. Basically everything took forever and we were left at our table without water or refills on salsa, beer and wine for extremely long periods of time. We all left complaining how disorganized and frustrating the experience was. The waitress did convince the manager to take off our queso from the bill which we appreciated but it would have made us feel a lot better about the situation had the manager come to speak to us about it as well.   Then today my wife and I decided to give it another try as we used to like the chopped salad as a lunch option and we thought maybe they had just been having an off day before. My wife ordered an Unsweet tea, the young waiter brought her a sweet tea. It took him a while to come back to the table. We both ordered the soup and salad combo. They got hers right this time but I only got a salad, no soup. We were both clear on what we wanted but it just didn't seem like the waiter was \"all there\". Like he was tired and unfocused and didn't want to be there. He also forgot our refill of salsa. When we were done with our meal it took forever for anyone to come check on us. We were sitting there with our food pushed away ready to get the check. The manager even peaked at us and saw us sitting there but still no one came. Finally we got the check and couldn't wait to get out of there because it took so long.  The food is decent here but it really does feel like there is an issue with the management that trickles down to the lack of urgency and quality of service with the waiters. The staff acts like they don't really care that much even when it's not busy. The overall sense of service in this restaurant is not good. There needs to be more management and accountability with the staff."}
{"text":"Been here several times and the Mexican fare has  been consistently great. I'm a fajitas junkie and tend to order that dish wherever I go, from LA to Texas.  I'm impressed with the steak and chicken combo here. My wife had the Korean BBQ and Mahi-Mahi Tacos...really enjoyed them. Try the Tahona Margarita, super!   We've been impressed with the excellent service we've had for all our visits.  Sandi was our server last night and was just excellent. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"A little out of the ordinary for (American) Mexican-style cuisine, which I find enjoyable. I've eaten here numerous times, and the service is typically terrific, as is the food. I'm especially fond of the Ancho Pollo tacos, as well as the Tejas tacos, which can both be prepared gluten free--a very happy thing for me and my health needs."}
{"text":"Wow, I disagree with a lot of what has been said about Cantina, I had a fabulous experience! I will admit, the great experience may have been due to the company that I was in, but I think the food and ambiance had something to do with it too :) First of all, the server let us know that their guacamole is a \"community favorite,\" and I am sort of obsessed with this comment. I can contest that it was some damn good guac. I know that this isn't helpful at all, but past that, I really don't remember what I ate....but I do remember that it was really good....sorry! Anyhow, the server was incredibly attentive and he let us sit outside even though no one else was. Food was good, atmosphere was nice and I'd say Cantina deserves a solid four stars. I will definitely be going back the next time I'm in CLT."}
{"text":"Wife and I came here after church today. We had a hankering for some good Mexican food as we had been a patron of the original 1511 on East Blvd. the place was not bust but probably about a third to half full. We were seated right away. Our server was johnny on the spot and took drink orders. That's where the quick service ended. The drinks finally came and we ordered the fajita platters. We waited an inordinate amount of time. When we finally got our food it was warm to hot but not sizzling fajita hot if you know what I mean. We witnessed another table that ordered fajitas and these was. Smoking hot and sizzling. Not sure what the issue is but that's why we gave the two star rating.   Chips and salsa was great. The waitress was friendly but there is an issue here that needs addressed. We will give them another try again in the future."}
{"text":"Went to this spot to order some takeout.  Ordered an Enchilada and Taco combo, both beef, along with other items for the family.  The taco, which normally has a crispy shell, was thrown into the enchilada sauce.  The person bringing us our order did not check to ensure order accuracy.  I was upset about the taco being soggy and gross, and went on to the enchilada, and it was chicken instead of beef.  Two strikes in one menu item.  The family got chimichangas, which were alright but were also sitting in a thick puddle of water.    Their to go boxes are those that you would recieve an elementary school lunch in- styrofoam with segments.  The beans were thrown into one segment and the rice into another, allowing for cross contamination.  I'm pretty sure the beans should be in a separate container, at the very least.  Bottom line, don't order takeout from here.  They don't take the time to ensure order accuracy, and they are not equipped with the proper boxes to handle takeout to begin with."}
{"text":"Great enchiladas and awesome dessert selection! I have a sweet tooth and it's always satisfied by the nutella pie! I like both locations one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"I was recently in Charlotte and had a white sangria at Cantina.  If anyone knows the recipe please post and if you haven't tried this drink be sure and order it the next time you are there!!!"}
{"text":"Way too heavy handed with the salt!! I wanted something light so I ordered vegetarian - Enchilada Verdes. The black beans were so salty they were inedible. The enchiladas were drowning in cheese and didn't feel light at all. This felt like horribly processed chain restaurant food but cost about 50% more."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the past couple years.  I went again the other day and had a crab, avocado and bacon quesadilla.  It was AMAZING!  Their salsa is always great too, but that quesadilla was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Consistently good service,experience, and food.  Different atmosphere from the original location on East Blvd, but all good.  They still have good Thursday beer specials."}
{"text":"We used to go to the East Blvd location all the time so we finally were able to get to the Park Rd location yesterday. The inside looks nice, the service at the bar was good, but was so disappointed in everything else.  They downsized the tortilla chip bowls. The red salsa, which we loved, was mega salty. When my husband, who loves salt, says something is salty, it's salty. We can no longer order a pint of beer. It's either 12 or 20 oz. Yet the price for the 12oz is the same as the old pint.  The table side guac, one of our faves, was salty. My vegan burrito was salty and I found traces of goat cheese in it. My husbands enchilada was salty.    Seriously, put down the salt shaker!    We are hoping this was just a fluke because for all the years we were going to the East Blvd location we never had a bad anything.    We'll be back and hoping for a better food experience."}
{"text":"Haven't been in years and was disappointed this time around. I think the menu has changed and not for the better. I usually like a seafood taco but choices were limited and everything seem to include jalapeno bacon. I ended up with ancho chicken which was to include avocado slices and it did not.When I asked my waitress about it she said no it did not include avocado. I guess I should have asked for the menu and pointed it out that it is listed. Anyway the chicken was bad with a strange ortega taco seasoning tast. My friend had the traditional enchilades and she said they were not bad but nothing to write home about. I am sticking with Azteca on Independence."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch after church!  I went with the french toast & jalapeño bacon.  Such a great decision, the french toast was delicious and I would put it up against any I have had previously.  Wished the bacon had more jalapeño flavor, but still tasty!  Will definitely do this again!!"}
{"text":"I walked in this restaurant with a group of 4. The restaurant was not busy. The hostess was not friendly. She seated us at a table located close to the bar and in the walk way. It would have been very awkward to sit there and eat. When asked for another table she was very unhappy and said told us we had to wait. Wait for what!? Needless to say we left. I can not comment on the food."}
{"text":"This is my first time ever post any complaint about experience in restaurant and I eat out a lot. We had a really bad experience at this place. My husband's coworker suggested this place, we thought we gave it a try. Food was bad first of all, service was even horrible. For example, our server took my drink without asking if I want  another one while we were still eating and the husband had a full drink. We will never go back to this place again."}
{"text":"Except for a couple of forgettable lunches, every dinner visit here over several years has been very pleasant. Well managed, superb ambiance and lighting, the right amount of bustle and noise, a wide patron demographic, nicely balanced menu, reasonable pricing, and attentive service. Every dish is worth a try, although the ceviche was perhaps a mild disappointment."}
{"text":"I just made my second trip to 1511 and I will choose somewhere else next time.  I have been eating at Mama Ricotta's for 15+ years, and have eaten at Big Daddy's a couple of times--I enjoy both of the sister restaurants so I do not know what the problem is with this restaurant.  On our first trip I wanted to start with the guacamole that I read so much about on Yelp.  We ordered it, and just when we were starting to think that the service was really slow--it was a packed Saturday night--our entrees came out.  When the manager that brought our food ask if we had everything we needed I told him we never got our appetizer, so please cancel that order.  He apologized and offered to bring it out now, but we declined since our dinner was there.  They did give us a coupon for a free guacamole which I thought took care of the situation.  Another manager came by and apologized, as did our waitress who we saw less of than the waitstaff at all the tables around us.  The food was pretty good, so I knew we would try it again.  Trip two.  We got there early this time, well before the crowd, and ordered the guacamole (forgot the darn coupon!) and a beer to start, while we looked at the menu.  My beer came out, we ordered entrees, the guac came out and before we could enjoy 3-4 chips our entrees hit the table.  They seem determined that I will not get to enjoy any guacamole.  Well equally determined, I slid my dinner aside and dug into the chips.  Truthfully, it was wasted effort.  It really wasn't that good.  There was very little flavor.  Unless they snuck it in while I wasn't looking there was no garlic, no salt, and no pepper added.  I doctored it at the table, but I have had better pre-made from the grocery store and that isn't $9.00.  I usually choose a local place over a chain when possible, and I really wanted to enjoy 1511 but the entrees are nothing special and the service did not meet my expectations.  The prices were higher than say \"On the Border\" and while I never felt like a sombrero-wearing group would start singing happy birthday to the table next to us, that was hardly enough to bring me back. Adios Cantina 1511."}
{"text":"Had drinks and dinner at the bar- food was fantastic, and Chelsea was attentive and did everything she could to make us feel welcome!"}
{"text":"The $7 lunch specials get 5 stars.....  all you can eat chips/salsa paired with about 6-ish entrees..... quesadillas, burgers, salads, etc.  All really good.  The Mexican chopped salad with chicken is by far my favorite.  Dinner entrees are all solid - I've tried just about everything over the years.  A tad expensive compared to market rates, perhaps.  4 stars.    As busy as they are, service is efficient and warm.  Lunch or dinner.  5 stars.  I don't recall the day of week, but there is one particular day when they have margarita specials - very reasonably priced.  Even their basic house margarita was fantastic.  5 stars.  The parking is a joke and receives 1 star.  I give them credit for recently trying to offer valet service to improve the situation, but the lot is just too small and not laid out well.  Period.  One day I observed the valet turning people away because the lot was full.  Another day, they had cars (all running but no one in them) lined up two by two all the way out to the sidewalk preventing other cars from entering the lot.  I'm not sure what can be done, and, again, I give them credit for trying something, but it's just not good enough.  If you can walk here or if you can come during off hours, you'll have a fantastic experience.  Drive up when they are busy - you may struggle."}
{"text":"So it's lunch time....just in the space immediately within my view, there are 13 4-tops, 3 6-tops and several outdoor 4-tops but the hostess is telling us the wait is 15-20 mins. When asked why, she responds they are waiting for tables to open up. When I point out the multiple open tables, she replies the real reason is they are short on staff and cannot manage the full restaurant today. Seriously??!!  The busiest time in one of the busiest areas in Charlotte!!!  Very disappointed. Would be leaving if we didn't like the food so much."}
{"text":"Where in Charlotte has authentic, fresh Mexican and Tex-Mex? Cantina Fifteen Eleven, of course. Once you get there, though, the question is, \"Who is Dennis and why are his enchiladas so delicious?\" Dennis is clearly a culinary genius who deserves a promotion and a bonus, because the roasted chicken, spinach and Mexican cheese enchiladas bathing in Chile con queso and avocado and red pepper crema is the most craveable dish on the Cantina menu.   There are complimentary chips and two types of salsa on the the table, but that is where the similarities end compared to other Mexican restaurants. Guacamole is made table side by servers and there are creative versions of Mexican classics that are surprising and gratifying. Jicama in the Chopped Mexican Salad, goat cheese, spinach and wild mushrooms in a quesadilla, and Salmon al Pastor are just the start of a menu comprised of fresh and unexpected choices at Cantina Fifteen Eleven.   Weekend nights are packed at the Dilworth location of Cantina, and valet parking is offered and recommended. The parking lot is small, and maneuvering within is often a tedious process.  Inside, there is ambient lighting shining from the star-shaped Mexican lanterns, comfortable seating and attentive servers and barkeeps who kept an eleven member Friday night group satisfied in a timely manner.   In addition to the Dilworth location, there is another Cantina in the Stonecrest shopping center on Rea Road. Though the menus and food quality are identical, the Dilworth location seems to offer a more festive and authentic atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of my \"go to\" Mexican places. It is very convenient in Park Road Shopping Center. Easy, free parking. Open floor plan. Good energy.   I like the 1511 margarita and the queso.   Check out their brunch. Some Mexican included choices and traditional ones.   Great outside seating. They use Open Table if you want to get a reservation."}
{"text":"The place answers the question \"How can you mess up enchiladas?\".  By smothering them in a cheesy mess and playing \"hide the chicken\", they do so quite convincingly.  The food is overpriced and they are surely fortunate to get a spillover crowd when the wait at Firebirds exceeds an hour as it often does."}
{"text":"The new Cantina location looks fantastic! The hubs and I set out for lunch on Sunday and even though we frequent the stonecrest location, we wanted to see what this one was all about. The food is consistently good and the atmosphere is top notch for a local Tex-Mex joint. We will cut our server some needed slack as it seems he was hectic and busy. Keep up the good work Cantina."}
{"text":"Definitely overpriced for what it is.  I had been to the Dilworth location before and really enjoyed it. This time i had a Creative Loafing deal and decided to try the Stonecrest location. I was definitely underwhelmed. We had a reservation for 7:00. When we arrived we were promptly seated. I immediately felt like i was at Chuck E Cheese or Red Robin. Kids Galore!! So much for date night. Our tables were so close together it was a little uncomfortable.   We ordered the Fajitas for two with Steak and Beef. The little tapas they brought out were pretty tasty. The fajitas were a little overpriced in my opinion. We maybe had 10 pieces of chicken on a platter of zucchini, onions and mushrooms. $30 for some veggies is a little crazy.   I would maybe go back but not likely."}
{"text":"We really enjoy coming here. It's the perfect place to go before or after catching a movie at Stonecrest. The tableside guacamole is really good, we always have to get that! They have a nice variety of tacos and have the choice of a corn soft shell! The chimichanga's are super good too and HUGE...prepare to get a to do box!"}
{"text":"When I want Mexican, I come here. I've been here at least 15 times and have never had a bad dish. Their menu has both traditional Mexican dishes and more modern ones. The portions are large and the food is delicious. I would say the entrees hover around the $14 point, making this more expensive than your average neighborhood Mexican restaurant, but the quality is far superior."}
{"text":"Guacamole is always delicious.  A true must get!!  The fish taco's were ok a bit too fishy for me.  Kids meal was not impressed have taken my kids there before and they loved it the chicken taco had a little chicken no lettuce, tomato or cheese or beans a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"Worst service received. Food came to table cold, after waiting for nearly 30 minutes. Food was pretty awful, definitely won't go back again"}
{"text":"I have been coming to cantina for a while. But I feel like it's starting to change somehow. When we arrived we realized that we were going to have to valet because parking is slim, which is normal. The valet was very friendly and organized. We were seated quickly upon entering the restaurant. Our waiter was very nice even though it took him a bit to get our drinks. I ordered a steak burrito and not only was it a ton of food but it was also excellent. It took a while for our waiter to bring our bill, which is understandable because they were busy. All in all I feel like cantina is still very good. But since the change of ownership things seem a little different. I hate to make the comparison but Cantina is starting to feel like a tgi Fridays for me, instead of a local restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! A little different selection than the norm, but who wants normal?"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!!  I've been a huge fan of Cantina.  Have gone there countless times for lunch for years. Well I've talked about this place so much that I wanted to take my Mon for Mother's day. We had to wait 10 min to be seated even though we had reservations. Once seated our waiter came flying by with one glass of water to tell us he'll be back with another. Another 10min I got a glass of water. 15min later I stopped someone to bring us chips and salsa. Now that came quick. Then the waiter took our order. Mom ordere basic breakfast, I got the avocado egg bake. Our meal took 45min and it was cold. My mom's plate had a spoonful of hashbrowns. I asked the manager if this was normal portion size she said no maybe they thought it was a child's plate. She said she would bring more but the hashbrowns take 30 min to make...This was just a terrible mothers day. It will be a very very very long time before I even think about going back!!!"}
{"text":"I love the crab & avacado quesadilla. Atmosphere is nice, but can get noisy with familes and roudy groups. I love the tableside guacamole too!"}
{"text":"So if you're into a little more upscale Mexican food this place is a good choice. There's two location, and I've been to both. The Dilworth location in Charlotte is by far better. The food presentation has more thought behind it, and the ambiance is all together nicer. You feel less rushed at this location and it's the original one. So if choosing between the two places ... go to this one first.   As for my meal at Cantina 1511, I ordered the Salmon al Pastor. This is a nice sized piece of pan seared salmon with an achiote and lime flavoring. It is garnished with roasted pineapple, and is placed over black beans on top of a fried tostada with pico de gallo salsa thrown into the mix. Also, on the very top of the dish there are two giant green grilled scallion bulbs garnishing the masterpiece. The dish goes for $16 and is excellent.   Warm chips and salsa come with the meal, and if you're lucky you'll get an amazing waiter just like we had. The server was so attentive ... it was almost comical how speedy fast he was. I loved it because it added to the whole experience.   All in all, I have nothing but good things to say about this location and meal.   NOW BEWARE: Parking is a bit tough on a busy night so keep this in mind. I parked in the lot next store. AND, if you're on a budget and are looking for a \"super inexpensive\" Mexican meal this may not be your place. Cantina is more upscale and the prices are not dirt cheap so remember that before choosing this location for anyone on a budget. Other than that - I hope you enjoy!  BTW: if you're wondering why only \"4\" stars out of \"5\" it because the meal was really good but not \"knock my socks off amazing\" for the price. It's totally a place worth going but I keep my \"5 star\" ratings for only places that I craze days, weeks and months after dining there."}
{"text":"I visited Cantina 1511 for a Saturday lunch and ordered the enchiladas de Dennis.  Although the flavor was warm and inviting it did not wow the palate.  The food seems to be very 'visitor friendly'.  It is as one would expect for TexMex, not a traditional enchilada but also not bold or daring in its ingredient selection or spices.    Service was adequate as it was not very busy around 1 PM on a Saturday. We were seated in the front of the restaurant closest to the road.  I'm not sure if the guys at the table next to us just had large lungs with voices that carried or if the room could have used some sound barriers because I could hear their conversation better than our own!"}
{"text":"I went to Cantina 1511 after noticing Eric K's recent review of this place on Yelp.  I can't believe I've overlooked this place until now. I'm a fairly enthusiastic consumer of Mexican food, and Cantina 1511 is the best I've had in Charlotte. I won't waste too much space reiterating all the great things that have already been said about this place, but I'd like to touch on the highlights.  The atmosphere is very nice--a little more upscale than your standard Mexican place. The service was friendly and professional--I was with a picky diner and they had no problems customizing her order. The food was obviously great, and I felt the prices were pretty good--dinner for two was about thirty bucks (without alcohol).   I had the Barbacoa, and everything about it was excellent. Presentation was great, temperature was perfect, and taste was incredible. My guest had the enchiladas and was similarly satisfied.  Highly recommended all around."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant.  The decor is fairly nice, but I didn't feel terribly out of place in shorts and a t-shirt.  Service was good.  I was expecting this place to have more vegetarian options on the menu.  There are a few, and the server suggested I replace the meat in a burrito with veggies (which I did), its just that I expected more options.  None of the Family-style meals are vegetarian (though I suppose you could ask, as they seemed fine with going off the menu).  But what I had was pretty good.  First up was the guacamole.  As several other reviewers have noted, Cantina makes their guacamole tableside.  It was very, very good, the right consistency/flavor/etc.  The only thing is that its $9, which seems really, really pricey to me (everything else seemed reasonably priced though).  My burrito was good too.  It wasn't anything fancy, just a burrito with sauteed veggies, rice, beans and queso.    So overall I liked this place.  Probably closer to 3.5 stars, but I have no problem bumping it up to a 4."}
{"text":"Good food.  Poor service.  Not kid friendly.  Not reservation friendly.  Three separate instances with poor experience.  One big plus is Sunday brunch menu."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best places in North Carolina. Starting with the chips and salsa to the main dish this place is amazing. All of the the tacos are unique and they all have different ideas and flavors. Personally the duck taco is my favorite, but feel free to explore the menu. If you live, or are just visiting Charlotte don't miss out on this great experience."}
{"text":"The burrito was delicious and a huge portion.  Be careful not too eat too many chips before the meal because they will keep bring them!  Great atmosphere with love music outside on the weekend.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My purpose in this post (my first ever) is to comment on their ability to run an event.  Jennifer Gallagher, event coordinator for the group, ran a bridal shower for me this month (July).... She is thorough, she is professional and she delivers. There are no surprises. She stayed (in the background) during the entire 3 hour event."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful! Service was awful-dishes were left in table when clearly we were done eating off them, had to chase people down to get water, our bill and a box. Just go get good food-and fingers crossed you get a better server than we did."}
{"text":"The dragon berry mojito is delicious and so is the guacamole! The enchiladas suck though- skip those"}
{"text":"Love Cantina 1511!  Delicious!!! The cheese dip is fabulous.  Our waiter encouraged us to try the cheese dip with bacon and pineapple added to it.  Sounds weird but it was YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm going to start of by saying our waitress was super friendly, and my friend and I received our lunch fairly quickly.   1. The Guacamole: Cantina offers table side guac, which is great for those who love their guac freshly made. You can't really mess up guac, or maybe you can. In this instance, she did. The guac was flavorless and kind of soupy. I'm not sure how the soupy part happened, but it did. Maybe the pico de gallo was missing cilantro or something? SOMETHING WAS MISSING and I can't put my finger on it. And I won't. I'll never order their guac again.   2. Chicken Tostada Salad: According to the menu, this salad is piled high with marinated chicken breast. Um, where was the chicken? I barely received any and I for sure didn't receive any marinated chicken. The chicken on my salad looked like cubed chicken that came out of a can. Totally underwhelmed and disappointing.   3. Churro Bread Pudding: What in the bland heck is this? I've never tasted a dessert that had absolutely no flavor. Our waitress suggested it to us and said it was the best dessert on the menu. Well, if this is the best dessert on the menu, I don't ever want to taste any of the other desserts. Ever.   If you couldn't tell, I love flavor. I love spices. When I go to a Mexican restaurant, or any restaurant, I expect for my tastebuds to be happy.   Maybe if I ordered a taco or a burrito, maybe I would have had a better experience? Who knows? I don't know - and I will never know, because I will not be back."}
{"text":"This was trip four, and time to sing the Cantina's praises. They're consistently sparkling - the smells as you enter, the grown up staff, the array of menu choices with both traditional Mexican cuisine and Tex-Mex, the unique salsa, the wonderful and varying flavors and presentations all add up to what you've been hoping to find in a fine Mexican restaurant, and just did. The Salmon al Pastor delighted from the grilled pineapple cap through the perfectly not-overcooked salmon tp the delightful pico de gallo. I was allowed a small taste of the Carones Mojo y Ajo; again, the flavors were fresh and original and not at all stereotypical. Sorry - no room for dessert."}
{"text":"After discussing lunch plans and deciding that we were  long overdue for some Mexican food my girlfriend and I decided to give Cantina 1511 a try.  For starters, the hostess sat us in a relatively unoccupied section and then sat subsequent patrons right next to us.  Although we were seated before the party next to us they got waited on first.  A few minutes later, Tim, our waiter materializes to taken our order.  Tim did take the time to help us navigate the menu and pointed out the main categories which was helpful.  After careful consideration, I ordered the two tacos - a carnes asada and whatever the duck one is called.  My girlfriend ordered the Enchiladas Verde.  Interestingly enough,  the fresh-made-to-order food came out not even 10 minutes after we ordered.  We barely had time to enjoy the greasy and over-salted chips that tasted of old cooking oil and salsa that tasted slightly worse than Old El Paso.  My girlfriend's entree arrives on a skillet with a pile of something under a pool of runny cheese and a another plate with two pitiful looking soft tacos (my entree).  We had both ordered black beans which were void of any real flavor and a complete disappointment (don't get me started on the Charro beans).  A minute or two into digging into her meal, my girlfriend realizes that there's chicken in her enchiladas.  We soon figured out she had been given the wrong entree.  Despite the mistake, the entree tasted like something you might get at a Senior's Center on Mexican food night. Thankfully she is no longer vegetarian.  We quickly flagged down the waiter and explained the mistake.  He said he would check with the kitchen but then showed up a few minutes later with our check.  Needless to say, we'll not be giving this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Not going back again to this chemical tasting food! Honestly its almost the worst mexican food I have ever had. Their rice tastes like it has been in a can for months. Its too bad because they have a really really nice establishment and a lot of potential. Also the service was not good at all, our servers name was Frank. Ask for another one if you go. Not recommended"}
{"text":"One of our PAK members ate here recently. Eating out with food allergies is never easy but Cantina 1511 made it easier. The restaurant had separate menus that indicated which items has all the common allergens. \"Cantina even noted which items contained soybean oil, soy sauce, vs tofu. As someone that is allergic to soy protein (but not frying oil) this was super helpful!!! Just ask the server for the menu.\""}
{"text":"Great guacamole here. We visited during a slow time and got to enjoy a very chilled out atmosphere. The food and drinks were delicious and obviously very fresh. The service was solid too! I will return."}
{"text":"Second visit in as many weeks - this place gets better and better. Need that queso!! Service great and drinks were on the weekly special so we have a great time at a very reasonable price. Quality always costs a little more!!"}
{"text":"Cantina 1511 has food ninjas. My tastebuds were unsuspecting and did not see it coming.  I think these may have been the best fajitas I've ever had. That is kind of weird. I don't have fajitas that often because they're kind of labor intensive. Also, they're not really that Mexican-y and kind of safe. Who wants to do all that construction for a stir fry taco?  I had to eat my words which was hard because I was also full from eating those scrumptious fajitas. The ingredients were fresh, starting with chicken, peppers and onions. Making a great meal with fresh ingredients is almost idiot proof. The meat and vegetable were seasoned with something different I can't quite figure, maybe a marinade?, but it wasn't the usual cumin and salt overdose. My dining companion ordered fish tacos and I'm sure I could have eaten those as well.  The restaurant has a chic ambiance and is large. However, the hardwood floors and wooden interior give it a friendly and intimate vibe. So despite the size of the dining area, it's not faceless.  Cantina 1511 isn't striving for the \"authenticity\" of an ordinary Mexican joint and that's a good thing. You won't find the standard numbered menu items, 1 taco, 2 enchiladas or plates swimming in enough cheese, sauce and oil to put you to sleep on the drive home. That's not a diss; I do love a spot where everyone speaks Spanish and serves it up that style. However, Cantina offers a welcome hipper and fresher take on Mexican fare."}
{"text":"This is a great place for something different. Its like they put it \"An Evolution of Authentic Mexican Food.\" You can tell the owners and chefs take pride in their ingredients and cooking style. I also like the fact they support local farmers and make their own cheese and tortillas. Atmosphere is nice, can get a little packed on certain nights. The South Charlotte location is a little more \"posh\" and larger...but food is superb at both. Try the soft tacos...can't go wrong. Lots of choices for spirits.   Only reason I did not give them 5 stars is for one simple fact. I have been going here for a while now, and everytime I leave a comment about not having fried ice cream on the dessert menu. They keep telling me it is messy for the deep fryers.....come on think of something!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was ok. Beware however that a \"pitcher\" of house margarita is in fact, a carafe- and more importantly is TWENTY EIGHT FREAKING DOLLARS. Friends and I were there on Saturday. My friend ordered us a pitcher of margaritas- granted, she did not have a menu when she ordered it but $28? If it was $28 I would at least expect something bigger than a carafe! I'll put a picture of said pitcher in the photos..."}
{"text":"Been coming for years.  They always had the best chicken nachos.  I've frequently dropped in for them for a quick solo dinner. They've recently changed the recipe from fajita style chicken to bland and soft pulled stewed chicken.  Texture and flavor are poor. Ruined the dish. So disappointing.  Guess I won't be coming back as often.  It's a shame.  Nice people and nice atmosphere.  Many other dishes are good but not so often what I'm in the mood for as the fajitas."}
{"text":"So my first review was based solely on trying to get a reservation for a friends bday, not the food or anything. I was very frustrated at that point, but would like to say that as soon as I wrote that review, not even a whole day later, one of the managers messaged me on here and apologized, wished my friend a belated birthday and gave me his personal email. He told me to email him whenever my friend and I would like to come in and he would take care of us!!! I dont make it to Charlotte as often as I like and I often forget about my yelp reviews so I just wanted to put this out there while I was thinking about it. That, to me, is great customer service and something so many businesses lack these days!!! I will definitely not hesitate to return the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"The food is edible, but not much more. I had the fish tacos, which I thought had a weird taste.  They tasted as if they were deep fried with the same grease used for a million other things and had not been changed for a long time. The service was bad. Took a half hour before our food came out.  Go to Mi Peublo if you want better Mexican food.  Won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"I love their blood orange margarita. Their food is tasty and service is good. Definitely will frequent this place."}
{"text":"This was the saltiest food I've ever had.  The location was trendy but couldn't save it from the horrible food.  This is a must-miss.  Taco Bell is more authentic."}
{"text":"First and last trip to new location.  Food was 4 star worthy.  Service (once seated) and wait staff excellent. However, new location is loud, open, more bar-ish, and LOUD.   We had reservations, showed up on time, and then waited 25 min to be seated.  Had we been told that they don't really do reservations we would have gone someplace else. Had we known it was going to be this loud we would have gone somewhere else. We wanted a nice date night.  Had we wanted club level sounds we would have gone to a club.   Loved the old location on East Blvd.  Was good ambiance, food and service.  We never had to wait when we made reservations.    We will miss you Cantina 1511."}
{"text":"I am not quite sure how people manage to call this Mexican food. I ordered the enchiladas de pollo and I was absolutely disgusted. There was so much queso on top of my enchiladas that it made it extremely hard to eat. I might as well have just ordered queso as my main entree. The side of rice that was given to me looked and tasted like fried rice from a local Chinese restaurant.   My service was outstanding and that is probably the only thing that was great about my dining experience. I definitely will not be returning. If I want some Mexican food, I will head to Central Ave. for some authentic food."}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican food for the area.  We've been many times and have never been disappointed in what we ordered.  The table side guacamole is awesome and worth it every time!  Service has been friendly for the most part as well."}
{"text":"I've been vegan for 4+ years. I've been in fine dining FOH for 23 years. Needless to say, I know food. Came in with a few cycling buddies after a long ride. Had one of the best tasting veggie burritos AND black bean burger (minus the chipotle sauce add pico) I've had, period. (Yes, I had both!) Tons of flavor. Great value. Large portions. Friendly, prompt and attentive service from host to waiter to floor mgr. Water always topped off and plenty of check backs without being overbearing. My friends really liked their meals too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was good. We both got the 2 taco plates. Salsa is awesome! We go here on/off - always a good experience."}
{"text":"Cantina is my FAVORITE Mexican restaurant in Charlotte. The guac is the best I've ever tasted, and I can never get enough of their salsa. Their margaritas are great too. Not a fan of the cheese dip though, but I guess there has to be one con!"}
{"text":"Great portion size. Meal tastes even better than it looks. Incredible drinks and attentive staff  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"We had the pulled pork tacos and Marco pollo taco and Tejas taco. Everything was delicious!  Very unique dishes, we haven't seen these menu options at other Mexican restaurants.  Great prices, excellent service."}
{"text":"Came here with a big party and were told 45 minutes to an hour wait, which is understandable given we were not able to make reservations ahead of time (they don't take reservation for large parties unless it's 24 hours in advance FYI) Stayed at the bar for 1 hour and checked back in with host who stated the wait would be an additional 45 minutes. Host was not sympathetic and told us we should have made a reservation even though this guideline is not posted online. Unprofessional and unaccommodating, refusing at first to even seat our group separately although there were multiple tables we could see that were available. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Not bad. Not good, mind you, but not bad.   The tableside guacamole did not taste fresh or luxurious, the kingly price notwithstanding.  I tried a number of different dishes here, and most were forgettable except for the slow-cooked pork, which was delicious. It was tender and juicy but crisp on the fatty bits, just as it should be.   Do not bother with the specialty margaritas. They're uninteresting and expensive."}
{"text":"Another Mexican place that makes Americanized Mexican food that reliance a on lots of cheese and salsa.  Nearly everything looks and tastes the same.  If you want American Mexican, flowing chips and salsa and sweet margaritas, there is always a crowd."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food is tough to find in Charlotte but this place does a solid job of bridging that need. Reservations were easy enough. This places uses opentable. The ambiance is very family oriented; don't be surpised to see children and families dining there for dinner. I got the enchildas and they came with rice and beans. Although I got only two, the meal was large enough that it filled me up. Food was flavorful and fresh."}
{"text":"Not the best burgers but environment is great and I recommend to get actual Mexican food there. The burger was basically a taco on a bun, gets a little soggy but fresh chips and everything else was great."}
{"text":"I think I'm about the only person who lived in Charlotte who is not a Cantina fan.  I've been there several times but I've always been disappointed.  Likes:  It's a fun atmosphere, buzzing with energy.  The margaritas and guac are good if you're willing to pay up for them.  Dislikes:  So expensive, even when they're running \"specials\" like about $18 for a pitcher of margaritas.  I had pork tacos one time: the food is sub-par and the quality is not great.  After that, I just got drinks there.  It's always packed, which can be good or bad depending on your preference.  Take it or leave it:  Leave it.  It's trendy but majorly over-hyped and over-priced.  I would expect better quality from a \"fancy\" Mexican place."}
{"text":"We've been to the Ballantyne version of this restaurant before, but this was our first time at the Dilworth location. I think the menu is similar or nearly identical, but this time we had some items we'd never had before and it was all absolutely fabulous. I had not been expecting it. The appetizer we ordered was something about Pig Wings and it was out of this world. The grilled and glazed pork pieces were exceedingly tender, flavorful and rich. The richness was gorgeously balanced by the acidity of the slaw and pickled red onions. Then I had their fish of the day (mahi mahi) cooked in a unique Spanish style casserole with garlic, pine nuts artichokes and Spanish sweet potato. Incredible. My husband loved his roasted carnitas (pork).  Best food in a LONG time, for a great price"}
{"text":"First time here today. Sat at the bar for a late lunch. Service was excellent, food was really good and creative options.   I hope they expand on more \"traditional\" items on the menu.  I had fish tacos (mahi mahi) and sort of missed the \"plain ol' grilled flavor\"..but is was still really good. Next time, i'll try the carne asada tacos.   This place has all the makings to be a go to spot"}
{"text":"ZERO STARS.  I actually ACTUALLY cannot comprehend how this place has an average of FOUR STARS, barring fake reviews.  This is my third time going... and you know what, I'll admit it, SHAME ON ME.  Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.  But along with that admission, here comes my scathing review, broken down into paragraphs for easy reference (ordered from good to bad to ugly):  SERVICE no complaints. hostess was friendly, promptly seated, table service was perfectly and absolutely a-ok.  AMBIENCE I will have to disagree with the yelper below who said: \"This isn't your hole in the wall Mexican restaurant... definitely a little fancier and the restaurant has a nice atmosphere.\"  I would much prefer a hole in the wall restaurant than a chain restaurant with fabricated pieces of flair... the only thing \"fancier\" about this place are the prices.   Another downside: the live \"music.\"  The first time I was assaulted by the live music was my first time at Cantina for brunch.  We were on the patio and the speakers/musician were literally 5 feet away.  What makes a mediocre breakfast burrito worse? A too-loud, too-close, too-American Idol rendition of Yellow by Coldplay.  Tonight was no better.  We were seated inside, but unfortunately, the musician was set up indoors, as well.  And again, the music was too-loud, too-close, and just not really... good.  But, to make matters worse, mariachi music was blaring from the restaurant speakers, competing with the live music.  What the actual hell.  Could nobody else hear what was happening?  FOOD oh boy, here we go.  Like I mentioned before, I've been here three times.  Each time I told myself two things: (1) the chips and salsa are really good; and (2) I just ordered the wrong thing.  At this point, I've tried enough things to know that someone (everyone?) in the kitchen does not know what's going on.  As referenced under AMBIENCE, my first time here was for brunch.  I got to try the breakfast burrito and the huevos rancheros.  How bland and unimpressive both these dishes were... I feel that someone has to be trying to make the food taste bad for these things to taste as bad as they did.  Second time was for lunch: some \"mexican\" salad and quesadilla.  Again, how someone was able to take the ingredients and make them taste this bad is incomprehensible.  How do you make a quesadilla taste bad? I'm actually asking.  What do you have to do to a tortilla and melted cheese to make it taste bad?  I want to know so I can do this in the future for someone I HATE.  final nail in coffin: dinner tonight.  We got a pitcher of house margs and ordered an assortment of tacos.  six in total: shrimp, fried shrimp, duck, \"catch of the day,\" chicken, and brisket.  Margs: too sweet and too weak.  On to the bulk of my complaint... the food was disgusting and certainly not fresh.  As soon as our plates were set down, we were both overwhelmed by a wave of rank-ass fish odor.  Ok, fine, whatever, we were still going to give them a fair tasting.  I'm such an inner fatkid and even I couldn't finish my food.  The shrimp, chicken, and brisket were edible.  EDIBLE.  no more, no less.  merely. edible.  The duck made my friend gag -- I watched as a grown man struggled not to barf in the middle of a restaurant.  It was overly gamey and did not belong in a taco (his words: \"it tasted like the duck was fed poop its whole life\").  The \"catch of the day\" could not have been less fresh.  It was mushy, fishy, and tasteless -- 1.5 bites were had... between the both of us... I had to spit out half my bite.   needless to say, we barely touched our entrees and what was eaten was a struggle to swallow.  I am flabbergasted as to how this restaurant is still in business.  with FOUR STARS.  I get that Charlotte isn't known for its mexican food, but... what? WHAT?!   TL;DR -- after giving this place more than a fair chance, I made a pinky promise tonight to never ever EVER come here again.  sure, it's convenient.  sure, they have good chips and salsa.  but, no. just NO."}
{"text":"I love cantinas food and have been to their other locations. I came in with a large reservation to the newest location.  They were not well planned to execute a successful party. We had reservations. Several people had to wait on drinks. Some tables already had food before others even ordered. They was also trivia going on. It was distracting and very loud."}
{"text":"I've put off reviewing Cantina 1511 for a while. It's one of those upscale Mexican places where a plate of tacos can put you back $20, and I'm just not sure it's worth it. Yes, the tableside guacamole is good, as it always is, but is it any better than what I make at home? If you try to go whenever people like to go out for dinner, there can be a wait and valet parking, which is always a pain. So, I guess what I'm saying is, it's good, but it's not as good as it thinks it is.  But you know when I love going to Cantina? When I've got a hungry crowd to feed. The family style option is a fun way to experience a lot of different things on the menu for not a ton of cash.  PS Get the barbacoa. You're welcome."}
{"text":"I am very glad I do not live in the Dilworth area because I would be in Cantina 1511 nearly every afternoon. It is common knowledge amongst my closest friends and family that I hold a dear place in my heart for Mexican cuisine. I feel it is often underrated and under appreciated so I am a bit biased but I truly believe Cantina 1511 is one of the most delicious restaurants I have ever been.   Whether going for a birthday dinner or after a long day at work, Cantina hits the spot. They have delicious drinks, my favorite is the mojito, at great prices. The appetizers are amazing. I prefer the queso with jalapeno bacon. The menu suits all tastes and is divided into \"authentic\" and \"tex-mex\".  Literally everything on the menu is delicious but I would suggest sticking to the \"authentic\" side for something a little different. My only word of caution is to either make a reservation or go prepared to wait because there is ALWAYS a wait!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed the restaurant and the food was great!  Because I had not made a reservation, I did have to wait about an hour on a busy Saturday night.  The guacamole was fantastic!  Recommend making reservations ahead of time."}
{"text":"If you were thinking of going to Cantina 1511 for Queens Feast 2013, stop thinking and just GO! Their menu includes four courses, and half price bottles of wine. How can you go wrong?  We went last night, for the first night of QF 2013 and had a blast. Our waiter, Javier, was attentive and really wonderful. If we go back, we'll ask for him again.  The food was amazing. For the first course, they serve you guacamole with your chips. For two people, you get a smaller bowl of guacamole than they usually make tableside, and it was really just mixed together at the table, not anything else. At first I was hoping for more, but I was only able to eat about a third of my entree by the time it arrived so really, the amount ended up being more than either of us needed.  I ordered the jicama and avocado salad for my 2nd course. It was HUGE! My husband ordered one of the soups which was also a generous portion. By the time my main arrived, the non-vegetarian enchilada dish, I was already nearing full. I ate a respectable third, but needed the rest to go in order to enjoy the Bananas Foster chimichanga they served along with ice cream at the end.  For wine, we had a bottle of the Pinot at $13, I think it was. For our normal dining out experience, it was a tad pricey (we normally don't eat anything but a main, maybe $15 per person) but for a Queen's Feast splurge the meal was generous and delicious, and the service was great.  Be sure to make a reservation, though! The place was packed."}
{"text":"Allow me to explain my ratings: 4 stars for the food, 2 stars for the revamped menu (read: PRICE HIKE).  Cantina tends to be my go-to place for Mexican. More because my daughter seems to love it here, and it's hard to please the culinary habits of a picky 5-year-old. We never go wrong here. We love the service - the waitstaff always seem to be personable, and I always appreciate management coming around just to say hi - and the food, a little more upscale take on more traditional Mexican fare (as opposed to, say, Tex-Mex, which is traditional, yes, but more akin towards Yanqui tastes, so you know) that always hits the spot.  So when I saw the menu had changed, I cringed. Menu changes often mean bad things, like some of your favorite plates have been unceremoniously removed from the menu. Alas, some of my favorite taco plates are no longer an option. Still, there's plenty more to chose from, and I did enjoy the shrimp and scallop tacos.  However...lunch the other day was $55. SERIOUSLY? Between my 3-taco plate, my wife's chicken quesadillas, my daughter's quesadilla's, a bowl of plantains, and a pint of beer, that all came out to $55, not including tip?   Wow. I can afford to drop $55 for lunch, but I object on principle. There better have been about 3 or 4 more pints of Negra Modelo included in that bill.  Oh well. You'll likely see me back at Cantina, except this time I'll be a bit more judicious about what I order, just to satisfy my frugality."}
{"text":"Ive been here plenty of times. Service has always ben excellent! Food is usually good. This last visit my tacos came out cold.... Sent them back and came out cold again. Server was very quick to fix the situation but did not seem to surprised by it. There was no manager to come over and apologize. Very disappointed in the resolution since there really wasn't one. My wife did not even eat her dish and the server didn't notice let alone offer to comp her meal as well. Lots of goofing around and major lack of customer service."}
{"text":"Recently visited for dinner on a Friday night. Slammed packed. I thought the service was very good. However the food was just okay. Didn't really live up to my expectations. Typically, when you go out for Mexican you get a ton of food and typically need a box for left overs. I got 3 tacos and it was $15 for that and they were unfortunately very small tacos that didn't really hit the spot. Nevertheless, we enjoyed the atmosphere, and service. Would most likely go back and try something else that might offer more food."}
{"text":"El lugar es fantástico la atención del personal muy buena !!! Son muy amables y la comida deliciosa se los recomiendo ^^"}
{"text":"Cantina is a great spot for Mexican food.  They have a fun atmosphere, some excellent guacamole, and overall delicious food.  I particularly enjoy the fish tacos."}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I went to Cantina for dinner last night. There was a little bit of a wait, nothing crazy. We get sat down order our food, everything up to this point felt pretty standard. We were given chips and salsa before our meal which we happily ate. All of a sudden my friend pulls out two Bobby pins linked together from the chip basket. We were so grossed out. We told our waiter and he looked at us and mumbled something and walked away with the basket. We didn't see him for a while after that. We didn't feel like this was being properly handled so we caught another server who's response was a little better and she said she would grab a manager. The manager comes over and we explain what we found and to be honest, there really wasn't even a true, \"I'm sorry\" or anything. The four of us all work in customer service and couldn't believe the lack of service we were provided. We simply wanted reactions that were more than \"That's weird.\" Or \"That's gross.\"  The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because the main food was really good, but who wants to eat their food after finding someone's hair products in their food?"}
{"text":"I used to LOVE Cantina!  I am really upset Frank sold it to some group that is COMPLETELY incompetent.  We first walked in without being addressed at all by the hostess.  We had to just start speaking.  We got Brittanie as our waitress and before we ordered she took the menus.  Luckily, I had one in our seat by the booth to pass around to all the people so we could order from it.  My friend had to ask for water over 4 times.  We ordered an appetizer and immediately after it came our entree's came as well.  All she could say was \"oops your entrees came fast!  hehehehe.\"  She charged me for 3 drinks instead of two and took 10 minutes to bring our checks after we said we were in a hurry.  This really ruined it for me.  Bring back Frank to whip them into shape!"}
{"text":"I had dinner at Cantina last weekend. There was a good crowd of people there. We were seated immediately and ordered drinks. The food was awesome! We started off with some Cantina Nachos. For my entree on this visit, I ordered the Salmon al Pastor. Excellente!  I am a service person as well. My waitress was attentive, helpful and friendly. I have been here multiple times and always have the best experience. If you are looking good Mexican food in a great atmosphere, Cantina 1511 is the place."}
{"text":"I ordered wrong, but that's on me. The chips & salsa were great and the boys all loved their meals, so I'm sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Gave them another chance since the meatball soup, salmon, and leche cake were solid. How they screwed up fajitas and guac is beyond me, but we wanted to like it and gave it another try.  Mistake. 30 min wait With a reservation. Chicken dry as a bone. Quesadilla awful. Ground beef burrito ok. And our main reason for coming back, the leche cake... An epic fail! Dry cake! So disappointed since it was truly life changing last time."}
{"text":"Great food! Authentic Mexican!  Loved the Barbacoa.  Tip: Ask for their iced coffee, IT IS GOOD! If isn't on the beverage menu. Tastes like a smoothie!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican place in Charlotte. Not authentic Mexican but it has some great and interesting recipes. The table side guacamole is a must, as the fresh avocados and other ingredients make for a great appetizer. You can also get crab and goat cheese with the guacamole, which is great. I'm a huge fan of the smokey duck tacos and the Marco Polo tacos, which have a nice shrimp with jalapeno bacon. Also tried the mushroom quesadilla and the crab quesadilla, both of which are awesome.   I'm sad the Dilworth location is moving as I will miss grabbing a margarita and sitting on the patio."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! I ordered the Thai shrimp tacos and the portobello mushroom tacos. My husband had some shrimp enchiladas that he really enjoyed. We started with the queso which is amazing and addicting. Complimentary chips and salsa, and the salsa is very fresh and delicious. Definitely the best either of us has ever had! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night with a group of friends. It was very crowded, so I am glad that we had a reservation!  I have been to Cantina when it was at the Dilworth location. However, havent been since they moved to Park Road area, so, I was excited to check out the \"new\" location. The restaurant is super open with a nice bar area and outdoor patio space (with TVs).Parking is plentiful.  Chips and salsa were good and plentiful. The salsa had a perfect spicyness kick for me. Neither salsa nor chips ever went empty.  Ordered the Pina Margarita cause it was one of the few drinks on the menu without that sugary mix stuff....not a fan of that. The marg was delish....though, after reading reviews, I wish I got the Picanta Pina Marg for a little extra kick. Next time!  Ordered the Ancho Shrimp Salad. Nice portion and the shrimp was seasoned well. The dressing was soooo good. Though, I doubt there was anything healthy about it cause it was so creamy! One of my friends didnt like guac, so I ate her guac on her nachos. Definitely will be ordering the guac next time!  Staff was super friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"As reported by other Yelpers The food at this place is at best subpar. While I cannot comment on the Mexican food the hamburger I ordered was absolutely tasteless.. I was left wondering if it was made of beef or some other matter. I should have paid attention to the other reviews and steered clear of this place."}
{"text":"DO NOT order takeout/Postmates from here or the Park Road location. We have ordered from here a handful of times (hoping they will improve) and each time they FAIL. Every single time they forget something. At least if you order postmates they correct their error in your price, if you do direct takeout they half address their failure. The manager may give you half off your guacamole order. I want so badly for this place to succeed but every time they FAIL!!  100% my fault for continuing to order but had such high hopes. They absolutely suck and I will never order from them again and advise you all to do the same. Ok rant over."}
{"text":"I like 1511 ok....it's a trendy spot spot for some fresh Tex-Mex. It's a little pricey for what you get. The Enchiladas de Denis are good, but everything borders dangerously close on being wayyyy too smothered in sauces of one variety or another (or both at the same time). You can kind of lose the rest of the food underneath all the sauce, and in turn, it makes the dishes overwhelmingly rich.  I always leave with a doggy bag (not necessarily a bad thing!) due to the food being so heavy!  Or it could be the massive amounts of chips and salsa I consume before the food arrives.....  I'm a sucker for table-side service....be it a bananas foster, waiter prepared caesar, carved whole duck.  So needless to say, I enjoyed the tableside guacamole.  But there is an operational advantage here too...when avocadoes oxidize, they turn brown and mushy.  Even after adding lime juice, it can still lead to a disappointing guac experience when you get a bowl of brownish green goo.  Good guac is creamy, not gooey!  You get the good guac here.  An overzealous waiter sqeezed some lime right into my eye when we were dining with some friends here on our last visit.  Made for some comedic relief to the dinner convo.  This place is always packed, so don't be surprised if dinner takes a little while to come out.  All in all not my favorite mexican spot, but I still come here about once a month, either for lunch with colleagues or dinner with the wife.  So I can't really bash too hard on a place I return to with some level of frequency!"}
{"text":"Food is good, service is just ok. The place is dirty. Tables left not bused and not wiped and floor covered with chips etc. just ok"}
{"text":"This was (by far) my favorite Mexican place when I lived in Charlotte.  Great nachos and sangria!  The happy hour in the bar/lobby is perfect for post-work drinks, too.  It can get a bit loud, so Cantina isn't great for an 'intimate\" date, but it's perfect for something more casual."}
{"text":"I started out the night wanting \"authentic\" Mexican instead of Cantina as usual. What a huge mistake. Cantina is always packed and on the pricier side for a reason. We ended up walking out of the place we were currently eating at and booked our table at Cantina before we had even paid the chevk. Chips are outstanding, margaritas are fresh and I'm never disappointed. Our server Scott was very friendly and incredibly helpful with picking a tequila. It might not seem \"authentic\" since it's a chain but it certainly is. If you're looking for good, fresh tasting Mexican, this is the only place we've found in Ballantyne that delivers A+ every time."}
{"text":"They are now doing brunch on Saturdays & Sundays. The \"Avocado Bake\"  is absolutely the best brunch item I have ever consumed! YUM!    The last time we were there, the portions were less than we thought they should have been;   this time there was enough food per entree to share. Our server was very attentive, polite and eager to have us enjoy our dining experience.  Go get brunch at Cantina 1511 on Rea Rd. !!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte. When I heard it had new owners, I got a little nervous. (and for good reason) The menu seems to be all mixed up. Very hard to read. A lot of the previous items, my favorites, are no longer there. And the food did not seem fresh at all. For a more Authentic Mexican experience (with a rougher exterior) I would suggest Azteca off of South Blvd."}
{"text":"I just moved here from Chicago. Lord help me. Friendly but slow, inaccurate service and lukewarm, inauthentic \"Mexican\" cuisine. First and last time."}
{"text":"We are at Cantina 1511 in Park Road SS. I had SW salad with chicken. Very large meal. We often sit outside but today it is 93 degrees. Michelle is our waitress, as usual. Katherine came by the table an we really enjoy her conversation. Roger M"}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in town. Although they are a Mexican restaurant, their shrimp and grits are the best we've had in Charlotte.  They also do a great job with their burgers, and the Marco Polo tacos!   The atmosphere and decor is really awesome: like rustic/industrial meets Tulum Mexico.  Not that over the top typical \"Mexican restaurant\" atmosphere with the colorful wooden chairs that's sooo overdone.   Another reason this restaurant is one of our favs is the size. We can typically get in no problem because there is so much seating. That's really nice, especially on a Friday night when you realize you forgot to make reservations.   We also bring our pup and eat on their patio pretty often in the summer. We love their Sunday brunch.  I do have to say the last 3 times we sat on their patio for brunch (last summer and fall) the music they were playing was horrible. It was almost physically painful, but I'd still say this place gets a 5/5"}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to the Park Road Shopping Center in Charlotte, North Carolina and to Cantina 1511. This upscale casual restaurant offers a unique variety of Mexican fares.  Dora here. What a gorgeous day! Too nice to sit inside and what a comfortable, relaxing outdoor space! They certainly live up to their creed, \"A tapestry of flavor, color, aromas and textures happening in a joyous and friendly atmosphere.\" As usual, we arrived super early, but this patio was jammed by the time we left.  For my meal, I ordered the Antojitos, an assortment of foods one might find on the streets of Mexico City, and the selection changes daily. Today, it included Nachos, Tlayudas (sometimes referred to as Mexican Pizza), Pig Wings Carnitas, and Salmon wraps. All four of these items were great, but my favorite was the Pig Wings Carnitas, pork shanks flash fried and tossed in an orange caramel sauce. As you can probably tell, they were crispy on the outside and full of favor. The salmon wrap was packed with fish, very tasty, and my second favorite.  Dora here. I don't usually choose to eat Mexican food because I tend to overeat. Shocker, I know, but those chips, y'all!! I could eat an entire basket by myself, especially here, where both the chips and salsa were soooo good. Just a little kick in the salsa and tomatoey thick. Yum! The Chicken Chimichanga was plump with chicken, black beans, and rice and a smattering of corn and cheese. Delicious, one of the best I've ever eaten, with all my favorite ingredients, and the slaw was a perfect accompaniment to add depth and crunch. I did not finish it, but I didn't leave the table feeling stuffed, either. What I really enjoyed about this dish was the fresh flavor.  What's your favorite Mexican dish? We'd love to know!

{"text":"If possible, I'd give it 3.5. The food is good, more like TexMex or fusion, not traditional Mexican. Good chips and guacamole. But the entrees are a bit over priced for what they are. The patio is a nice spot."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night for dinner. The menu looked great but the service was disappointing. The drinks and food took a long time and the waitstaff wasn't attentive. They brought the wrong food out and were very slow on drink refills.  The ambience is great especially outside and the live music was great. The staff was good about taking the wrong food off the bill and was accommodating. I'd recommend going on a week night and maybe service would be better when it's less crowded"}
{"text":"It's not possible to dine at Cantina 1511 and feel sad. This new restaurant, which just opened Oct. 22, has an upbeat, fun vibe. I enjoyed prompt and friendly service at the bar. Energetic and warm vibe, great for a group.   5 stars for atmosphere and drinks, 4 stars for food."}
{"text":"Love this place for family night out, date night or what ever night. Everything here tastes fresh and has great flavor.  I am a fan of the tacos. Every time I visit I have intentions of ordering something new but the Tacos call me and I cannot resist them. The Tacos al Pastor, Carnitas Johnny, Carne Asada Steak I drizzle a little lime over them and I get so happy. My wife loves the Barbacoa de Puerco and we both love the Margaritas. What makes this place easy for us is the kids meals my twin 5 year olds find something on the menu each time that they will eat and love. I as a parent can feel good that they are getting a real meal. We can have a nice meal and everyone can find something they love to eat."}
{"text":"To quickly sum up a horrible experience we ended up walking out after 50 minutes. In that 50 minutes we never even got our drinks. After being seated for 15 minutes we had to flag down a waitress as no one had come to our table even. 35 minutes later no drinks or appetizers arrived so we left. Many other people we also walking out.   This place should be avoided at all costs."}
{"text":"Meal:   (1) Carnitas Johnny taco on soft white corn tortilla (1) Tacos al pastor on soft white corn tortilla Charro beans Mexican vegetable rice (2) Top shelf margaritas Tortilla chips with red and green salsas  The charro beans and vegetable rice were so salty there were not edible.  You can get better carnitas at any regular Mexican restaurant with authentic dishes.  The al pastor taco was the best dish I had, and I would recommend that if you visit.  The margaritas were large and properly balanced and worth the $10.  Chips and salsa were solid.  Decor / Ambiance: fairly typical colorful Mexican restaurant dining room with a more upscale bar/lounge area with leather chairs, dark wood tables, etc.  The \"private\" group dining room surrounded by glass walls at entrance was oddly situated.    Service: Waitress was probably a B+, except when I asked for the Mexico City street-style corn, the she said \"they were out the last time she checked a couple of days ago.\"  OK....  Overall: Cantina 1511 undoubtedly has great local press along with positive Yelp reviews and a very promising menu.  Unfortunately, the food quality was just not there.  Overall, Cantina 1511 feels like a chain version of an \"authentic\" Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Short staffed during our first time! Led to very delayed service. We hope it was just a one time thing, but will try again!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican food in Charlotte.  Service was great everything.  Try the Guacamole it is to die for. You may want to make a reservation this place packs in the people.."}
{"text":"I called this restaurant today to place an order, their effin representative hung up on me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not so much tex-mex as it is authentic regional Mexican cuisine, Cantina is a welcome treat in Charlotte.  Coming from California where traditional Mexican is common and delicious, I was a little disappointed in Mexican fare here - until I found Cantina 1511.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Busy friday night. We had no reservations with a party of 10 people. we waited for about 20 minutes and they sat us which was pretty good considering it was a busy friday night. Our waitress was very friendly and overall the service was good. I ordered the chicken quesadilla and it was enough to fill me up with a piece or two remaining. My husband ordered three tacos which were the fish of the day \"grouper\", some pork, and beef.  He was very happy with his tacos until he bit into the grouper. He said it was too fishy for him. Thinking to myself it can't be THAT bad, I took a bite into his fish taco and man was it BAD. It was so fishy that I had to spit it back out into a napkin. Our other friend had ordered the same fish taco so we watched him take a bite into his before telling him how bad it was (just to see if it was just our taste buds lol). He took a bite into it and his face just said it all. He hated it as well. We told our waitress and they gladly took off the 2 fish tacos off our tab and the manager came to apologize as well.   Overall experience was good and we will be back :)   P.S the dragon berry mojito is soooo yummy! I had two :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. We literally got up and left after FIFTY minutes because  we had not so much as a margarita.  DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!"}
{"text":"SALT must be their number one ingredient.  This place is okay.. but not great, and every time I've been I've always left feeling super parched, their food is always very salty! As far as Mexican food, you can probably find better in Charlotte that hasn't been glorified and dollared up as it has at Cantina."}
{"text":"My family and I came to Cantina 1511 for my grandfather's 60th birthday. We were served complimentary chips and salsa which were absolutely delicious. The chips were thin and crispy while the salsa had a strong taste of cilantro (which I loved). The service however was not good at all. They never came and refilled our drinks, chips, or salsa without being asked, even when there was close to nobody in the restaurant. They just really didn't care or do the duties of good waiters. The food didn't impress either, I had a chicken quesadilla that had really weird tasting cheese. The enchiladas were gross looking and dry also. However, the tres leches cake was pretty good and very moist . Overall, I probably wont come back to Cantina 1511 because of personal preferences."}
{"text":"Cantina is okay. Not great. I had a margarita flight that I probably should have asked the price of before buying. It was good but not worth $15. I went with a semi-large group of people and we got a great waiter. He told us what the specials were for the night, and my mother and I opted to try. It was shrimp and scallops with some kind of corn and cilantro aioli? (Maybe lol). He warned that we probably shouldn't share, but we decided to anyway. He was right. Two shrimp. Two scallops. On a PILE of corn. On top of that the shrimp were tough. (Also not worth the price. Close to $30) So I ordered some some chicken dish that was a chicken breast filet with a small wing attached? (Again maybe...lol). It came with potatos and peppers. It was a little bland. I'm glad we had a great waiter. Other than that it's nothing you should be in a hurry to get to."}
{"text":"MEH. This place is hit or miss. The food is good, I like the barbacoa, but the service can be awful. The  uppity older male host was rude to me and my boyfriend for not knowing where to find the bathroom by approaching us as we looked lost and saying \"LIKE I SAID, the bathrooms are around the corner!!\" Its like, dude, I didn't notice that you were talking to me before, why are you being so rude?  The parking can be a nightmare. Their motto pretty much is \"we can be rude, cuz you probably will be back to eat our food\"  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I sent this email to the store manager and never got a response.   Good Morning,   I am writing to you our of great disappointment. Cantina 1511 has always been one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte since it's opening. I have since moved out of town.l However last night I met and old friend at your Park Rd location and had some of the worst service I have experienced. Our server's name was Michelle, she had red hair. We arrived for our meal around 6:10 pm and were seated outside. Michelle stopped by the table and said she would be right with us - after five or so minutes she brought us our waters and we ordered some beers. It took 10 minutes for our beers to arrive and then she walked away to help another table before even offering to take our order. After an additional 10 minutes she did come back to take our orders. I got some vegetarian tacos (so not meat to cook) Queso, and my friend ordered the Crab and Goat Cheese Croquettes ( a simple fried appetizer). We proceeded to wait 45 minutes for our dinner while the three tables that were seated after us got their meals. When we inquired about our meal we were told and I quote: \"The croquettes have mashed potatoes in them so that takes a long time.\" Seriously - they are fried. So we finally get our food, and my vegetarian tacos come with the charro beans that have meat in them - so I didn't eat them and I didn't bother saying anything because we had already been there for over an hour. Then after we ate we waited about 20 minute for our waitress to stop avoiding us and bring us the tab. She would look right at us, and then go stop at another table, my friend finally went inside to find her and asked her to please bring our check. So in total we were at your establishment for almost 2 hours. I try not to complain, but I am just so disappointed. I understand that you establishment was busy, but this was unacceptable service."}
{"text":"WORST MEXICAN RESTAURANT EVER- Ok- Can somebody tell me how is it possible to go to a Mexican restaurant and have a BAD margarita!!!! Not to mention that our server said the menu was missing some items... SMH  Well it gets worse not only did I have a bad margarita I also received terrible service. I spoke with the manager &'shared that the restaurant changed ownership 4 1/2 years ago! WOW this explains A LOT! Save your time, money & gas."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I LOVE Cantina 1511! You can always count on the food being great. I always get the shrimp P.O. boy tacos. They're fantastic! The service can't be beat either. If you have room for dessert, make sure to get the Quatros Leches! We're moving away and trying to get as much Cantina as we can before we go!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food but nothing too special about it. Good quality, cool atmosphere but nothing that really stood out as a wow factor. Would definitely go back because it was good but hoping for something stand out next time around."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite on a Saturday for lunch. I sat at the bar, service was good. I ordered the Mexican Mule which came in a copper cup and uses Tequila; it was delicious. For my meal I got the El Diablo burger, Spanish for The Devil, because of the Ghost Pepper cheese and jalapeños. Since I'm getting used to eating Carolina Reaper sauce I can't claim that this burger had much heat to it. What I will say is that it was very flavorful! The burger had a decent heft to it as well. Instead of fries I opted for the side salad which contained corn, garbanzos, and Haas avocados; very good. Dish also came with some carrots and cauliflower.  The chips and salsa are good as well."}
{"text":"I had low expectations coming in but The Carne Asada Steak was supreme! It's more like Mexican food with an American take, but good nonetheless."}
{"text":"We've had much better and we've had much worse.    For starters, the valet refused to valet our car.  Well done valet! Thankfully the hostess was friendly and our server was spectacular! Stellar service, truly.  The food: Tablemade guacamole was not great, very slimy and lime-y it lacked a truly fresh guacamole flavor.   Chips were light and delicious as was the smoky salsa.  The mexican chopped salad was decent but I HATED the dressing and needed a lighter vinaigrette instead of this cumin/mayo option.  Crab quesadilla was fantastic in all it's buttery, cheesy gooey glory It needed no salsa, no sour cream and definitly no guacamole.  My man had the Mexican meatball sandwich with jalapeño/cheese bisque and it was apparently out of this world!   All in all, I thought it was pretty good but I know when it comes to Mexican food in the south, I am nearly impossibly to please!"}
{"text":"I agree with some of the reviews, it is a trendy place but the food is exceptionally good and service is as well. I ordered the pulled pork (I forget the name of the meal)  and the food was plenty, I was satisfied and content with my meal. The drinks are good to. Nice place to go if you want to try something different"}
{"text":"My first trip to the new location. Despite the parking issues I really prefer the old location.  This new one is an open space and LOUD!!!! You have to yell across the table to converse. This is the concept that many places use to attract the younger crowd although we boomers are a much larger market.    We had reservations but had to wait for a table. After making an ass of myself about this I was informed that a reservation only moves you to the head of the wait list when you show up. This used to be called \"call ahead\" whereas a reservation should hold you a table. It was a good thing we got there early on a Wednesday evening because at 730 when we left the line was out the door.     Thankfully our waitstaff was excellent as was the food!  chicken chimi for me and crab quesadilla for my bride."}
{"text":"New location is great, especially the patio area up front. Much nicer all around vs. the previous location on East Blvd. Always good, consistent quality food every time I've been there."}
{"text":"Food was great but was really offended when a manager, male, in a red shirt yelled across the restaurant to a female employee \"Punch out and go home or I'll call security\".  He said this twice as he got closer to her.  That is no way to talk to anyone and was extremely rude.  I will not come back as long as he works here. This happened at 6:00pm on June 13th. I was sitting in the big circle."}
{"text":"We dined here this past Saturday night and had a wonderfuk meal.  We knew that new owners took over a little over a year ago adn wanted to see if it changed.  It did not.  The food was just as great and so were the drinks!!!  Started off with tableside guac and we each had a few drinks and entrees.  I had two tacos which were fabulous as always.  Our 5 year old son with with us as well and he had a great experience. We look forward to visiting again soon!!!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar last night with my hubby for drinks and apps and everything was great! They make amazing margaritas and the nachos were outstanding!"}
{"text":"Love this place - the food is great and the atmosphere is relaxed. Nice place for a date night or a fun time with friends. We ordered the fresh made guacamole and it was super delicious. I had to send my first drink back bc it wasn't up to par, but they made it right the second time and my favorite is the leches cake - a must try! Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"At best, two stars... The chips and salsa were good, but it kind of ends there. What happened to this place? I ordered a beef chimichanga that seemed to have more rice than anything in it. The waited forgot my husband's soup (2nd choice as they didn't have their house soup available)- so no soup for you!  After dinner was over, we looked toward dessert (it was Valentine's Day so some chocolate seemed appropriate) only to be informed that 3 of the 5 desserts listed were also unavailable- apparently a major menu 'revamp' is in the works, but for now you can basically have some key lime pie. Disappointed- won't be back."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food! Have always had a good meal and good service when we've eaten here. I usually go for the 2-3 taco dinner. I've tried different ones every time and never been disappointed. Had a blood orange margarita last time and it was very good. The only weird thing I will say is their takeout option. You order then show up and the hostess directs you to this tiny computer next to the bar and right in front of the kitchen. It's extremely tight and you are in the servers way the entire time. Probably would make more sense for the hostess to get it? That's my only recommendation. We will likely eat here many more times due to it being walking distance from our house."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for our anniversary. It's not exactly the typical anniversary spot...but we wanted to go.  Here's a quick run down..  Parking - comp valet, otherwise, it's a bit of a pain...but it's Dilworth  Atmosphere - fun, just loud enough to feel like you can talk   Food - the guacamole is amazing...must get this! Chips were nice and fresh.  We had the Al Pastor Taco - very tasty. The Tejas (brisket) taco was good. The Barbacoa Pork was very tasty as well. We split all this and were more than satisfied. Dessert was the Quatro Leches...very sweet and good.  When we go again, I will get the  Al Pastor in a Barbacoa set up.   Service - we have had better, but we aren't picky about this when the food is so good.  We will be going back."}
{"text":"Cantina 1511 has been a staple restaurant for my wife and I since moving to Charlotte 6 years ago.  It was recommended to us when we first moved here, and we have since recommended it to others.  The food and service are always excellent.  I love getting 2 Marco Polo tacos with their delicious side salad.  Another favorite is the Carnitas (Mexican barbequed pork).  Obviously, with so many positive reviews, you know their doing things right."}
{"text":"Had Birthday lunch there today with my co workers. The food was great and our sever Nivea was amazing"}
{"text":"My mom is a Mexican Chef and took her to Cantina in 2012 and she absolutely loved it! We went there a couple of times, but then I stopped going for a few months. Apparently they changed ownership and I visited the restaurant with my husband again a couple of weeks ago. It was a waste of our time and calories. The only good thing was the service. The chips tasted old and their red salsa tasted like everyone else's, straight out of the bottle. I read that their green salsa was incredible, so I ordered it, and it was a shame! It tasted straight out of the bottle too. I am Mexican, I would know! I ordered a burrito and it was okay, nothing out of the ordinary as it used to be. Definitely not worth my trip to this place, when I can most likely find fresher food with more taste at some spot down central avenue. I wasn't looking for authentic, I know that is hard to find, but I was looking for quality food that is unique in taste and savory. Not coming back again!"}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte & found this place on Yelp.  Food was awesome and would definitely go back.  Guacamole rocks!"}
{"text":"When we walked in, it looked busy but we were automatically seated. Our server was very attentive.  Young female manager came up and checked on us and made us feel welcome. Food was great! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"After three brunches and two dinners here, I give this location 3 stars. Brunch is the better option. Last night I came here with my family and was quite disappointed. My sister got the chicken enchiladas and said that her food hardly had any flavor. My mother got the beef and chicken tacos and said the same, lack luster flavor. I had the shrimp and fish tacos and immediately knew all my seafood came frozen. My mother and I had margaritas and you'd think that after two drinks you'd feel a little buzz, but we didn't. I don't think my 1800 margaritas had any tequila in it. Only good part was our waitress!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican spot in Charlotte.  I do have to say, though, that I liked their other location better.  The food, however, was still superb.  I could eat nothing but the guacamole made table side.  Since, I ordered the guacamole, I decided I needed to eat a little lighter than usual.  I ordered the small salad and a bowl of tortilla soup without chicken.  Both were exceptional.  I loved the tortilla soup and wish I could go back for that.  It had lots of ingredients and the cheese really brought it to a new level.    Service was wonderful and accommodating.  Wish I still lived in Charlotte to keep going back."}
{"text":"I've tried different Mexican restaurants in the area and no-one has better food or chips and salsa than cantina. Never had anything I didn't like. Even their salads are fantastic. If anything, it just keeps getting better."}
{"text":"Been there twice. First time, they told me they can't seat us because they have possible reservations and the place was empty. That should have been the sign.  Well, we tried it again today , and it was horrible, the people did not wait on us. We had to sit by the bar. Service was terrible. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Good food, great margarita and ok guacamole. The staff was very attentive to our drinks and appetizers. Although it took them 1 hour to take our dinner order. If that wasn't a problem, I would rate higher."}
{"text":"Two stars are really just for the amazing guacamole -- without it, Cantina would get 1. The service at this location is HORRIBLE. For a lunch place in uptown, they are the absolute worst at getting you in and out within an hour. It's a combination of horrible wait staff and a very slow kitchen. I've dined here three times in the past 2 months, and every time it takes at least an hour and a half. Plus, the food never comes out hot (or even warm). The food has also gone way downhill since the days of Cantina on East Blvd. The enchiladas de Pollo were inedible with globby, mayo like sauces on top (at least 1/2 inch thick). The icing on the cake was when the bar was out of grapefruit juice to make Palomas. Don't have a drink on your cocktail menu if you don't regularly stock the ingredients for it. Trust me, this place won't last in Hearst Tower at this rate. I give it less than a year"}
{"text":"Awesome brunch option! Will go back for dinner for sure! Came here with the whole fam and everyone was impressed. I'm not a huge brunch guy (we went for lunch) but when I looked at the brunch menu I was intrigued...and I'm glad I tried it...really cool twist on eggs Benedict with Arepas in place of the English muffins. Can't explain how good this was. Kids had lunch quesadillas and wife had a Chimichanga everything was awesome...we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Giving this a five stars since I don't think the yelp rating reflects the service and food that we had.  I can't remember the waitress' name but she had the purple hair. I will update when I have more time."}
{"text":"The worst service ever. Had to beg for a menu and then they would never come back to take our order. Atrocious!"}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were great! Thin, crispy chips and spicy red salsa. Ask for the green tomatillo salsa as well. Other diners said the shrimp taco and tortilla soup were really good.   My meal was average. Chopped salad with almost no flavor, grilled vegetables that I could do better at home, and queso dip that had a good base but lacked salt or any other flavor."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant at the East Blvd location and we were excited to try the new location at Park Road.  It was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. -Host staff was rude and quoted us a 30 min wait. After 35 min I politely asked our place on the list. 5 people ahead of us. Really? Also host staff were rude - After a 50 minute wait we were finally seated. Our party could barely hear each other over the \"musician\" -appetizers took  25 min to arrive. Queso was disgusting, Qdoba across the street has better  food overall  -entrees arrived after an hour of being seated. Food was bland and cold -Waited 20 min for the check  Best part of this meal was going home. Horrible service, horrible food, horrible experience. Sad because I used to love the margaritas and tacos here"}
{"text":"Went to Cantina last night...not real busy Decided to wait for a patio table. Did not take long for tables to open up but no buzz from the hostess station so we went up and asked. They replied they needed to clean the table. Another 10-15 goes by and I peeked out to the patio...4 open tables...so I went back up and said were ready to be seated...the hostess was stippy and said the same thing...need to be clean so I said no the don't there are 4 tables open. She huffed  and walked us to our table. I have run restaurants and would certainly want to know if guest were being treated like this by the restaurant initial contact. I asked for a manager...one showed up 20 minutes later...sorta so late we just chalked up the visit to a joke. Food was fair Music was Great. We've been to Cantina many times...this was most likely our Last Visit. Go at your own risk...new ownership has really let thing slip. PM"}
{"text":"We love Cantina 1511! We usually go at least once a week whether it be for brunch, lunch, dinner or just drinks. The customer service is as good as it gets, especially in the bar area. Chelsea, Roger and Julian are just awesome. We've tried just about everything on the menu and everything is delicious. We love the burgers on the menu, I believe these were added to the menu in the past year or so. The guacamole made table side, the quesadillas, fajitas, tacos - everything is fantastic. And did I mention we love the bar staff :) Cantina is our favorite place!"}
{"text":"Cantina 1511 in Park Rd Shopping Center is really good, so my co workers and I were excited to hear one was opening in Uptown. First experience left a lot to be desired...service was slow, food was cold, the hard shell I didn't order was stale, and there was hardly any meat in anyone's tacos. Won't be back!   UPDATE: Waited a couple of months before trying this place again, hoping they'd get it together after being open for awhile. Have been pleasantly surprised by the improved service and food! Come here for lunch a good amount now!"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Table side guac is very good. I found the best idea when looking for a good food and casual experience is eating in the bar area. The appetizers/small dishes are the best choice for the palate and money."}
{"text":"When I think of fun Mexican in Charlotte, I think of Cantina 1511. While I'm a frequent visitor of the location in Dilworth, the location off Rea Road is just as good, though the ambiance is better in Dilworth. Margaritas are good and they usually always have Corona on special. Outside patio is fun too, especially for lunch on a nice day. The lunch specials are affordable and plentiful.   For dinner, I'm a table side guac guy and a barbacoa fan. The barbacoa fills me up for only $12. Traditional food and some specialty fare allows for many choices. I do break out sometimes a go for the Enchiladas Dennis or the Carne Asada Quesadillas. Great for groups of friends or families. I've celebrated many of friends birthdays here. Great food and not too expensive for everyone."}
{"text":"My workmates love this place - or at least we somehow keep going here. The food is tasty enough for what it is and I'm ok with the prices, but the service in the bar area is HORRIBLE. Hoping management reads yelp since the people at the bar are friendly but horribly inefficient and even though you've staffed sufficinently, it doesn't help if there are lots of customers and your team members are standing around chatting with each other, completely obivious to customers in this economy who want to spend money."}
{"text":"Before I discovered Cantina 1511, I couldn't find any really good Mexican restaurants in Charlotte.  Sure, I'd found some that were average where you could get your basic Mexican \"fixins.\"  But it wasn't until I dined at Cantina that I said, \"Yep, that's the one!\"  Cantina isn't your traditional Mexican restaurant; it's more of an upscale/gourmet Mexican restaurant, but not at all pretentious.  The atmosphere is very jovial, lively, and casual.  I have yet to have a poor experience...for lunch, dinner, or even brunch!    To start, they bring chips and two types of salsa (one red, one green, both delicious) to your table.  And if you're really daring and love it spicy, ask your server for the extra hot version!  Of course, everyone knows that by the time your main Mexican entree comes, you're already filled up on the chips and salsa; however, don't let that stop you from ordering the freshly made guacamole to go with the chips and salsa.  It's a little on the high-end pricewise, but it's well worth it.  They make the guac right at your table so you get to see all the fresh ingredients going into it.  Then once you take a bite...WOW.  You'll want to order it all the time.  It truly is the best guacamole I've ever tasted.  (Even better than the real authentic stuff in Mexico -- shhhh!)    As for the entrees, I've tried a variety of items, but I keep going back to (1) the Enchiladas de Dennis (spinach, chicken, and cheese) and (2) the taco combination platter where you can pick one, two, or three tacos.  The shrimp and tilapia tacos are out of this world.    And don't forget the drinks!  Both the mango margarita and white sangria leave me wanting more.    One of my favorite afternoons was when three of us got out of work early for the day and went to Cantina for lunch.  It was the perfect spring day:  sun shining, temperature just right, and birds chirping.  We sat outside at Cantina to enjoy the beautiful weather, drank margaritas, and had a delicious lunch.  It doesn't get any better than that!"}
{"text":"Came here for a group lunch on a Thursday.  We had 11 people and thought we would need a reservation. One was not needed! There was plenty of seating for us! The service was fast and helpful. We had someone who can't eat cheese and the waiter was very patient with helping the person order a burger to his liking.   I was mixed on if this would be a great place for food based on the reviews I read. I never went to this restaurant when it was on East blvd so I can not compare it to that.   For my first time I was pleased with the food! I ordered the 5 cheese queso and the spinach chicken enchiladas with the white sauce. The main dish was pretty good! The consistency was perfect and really good flavor. Now the queso.. I was slightly disappointed. It is difficult to disappoint me with cheese! I thought it was slightly bland. I also thought it tasted like cheese you would get at a fondue place and I'm not the biggest fan of that. I shared with others and they loved it! So it's all about preference. I was not paying for my meal and I would've been disappointed if I would've spent $9.75 of my own money on the queso. I put it in my rice though and it was good!   Other people at my table got burritos. I have NEVER seen a burrito as big as these!! They could last you 2-3 meals probably!   Overall, the atmosphere was great, you get free chips and delicious salsa, and the food good! I would probably go back."}
{"text":"Tip top service, delicious guac (I gauge all mexican restaurants on their ability to make good guac) and an all around perfect eve with baby and husband.   We made an early resi on opentable, were seated immediately, baby was taken care of first and foremost by the host (always a good sign of great service in my eyes rather than \"UGH...you brought a BABY?\"), several waiters/hosts stopped by to make sure all was OK, and our waiter was very professional and QUICK.  He also shared a secret for making guac regarding the \"order of operations\" (mix lime, salt, and peppers first to bring out the true flavor of the serranos) that I was excited to learn...  Now on to the food.  DELICIOUS tacos.  DELICIOUS fajitas.  I am kind of a mexican food NUT and I have to say - we can't wait to go back.  While eating leftovers on Sunday morning (we couldn't wait until lunch) we were still talking about how good the house-made tortillas were.    The brunch looks RIDICULOUS.  (good ridiculous...)  5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"My oh my. Cantina1511 in Uptown is wonderful! Fresh and refreshing Mexican and Tex-Mex. It's hard to find good Mexican food. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We were here on Cinco de Mayo, obviously it was super busy. We had made a reservation for 5 on open table but we were running late because of an accident, I called to let them know we were running late and expected that we would have a bit of a wait when we got there. We showed up about 15 minutes late and to our surprise they held our table. I couldn't believe it considering how crazy busy it was...Our server was phenomenal- I believe his name was Stan, at least that's what it says on the receipt. He was super attentive and friendly, kept checking in to see what we needed and made small talk, I would honestly request to sit in his section again because he was that great. On top of that the food was delicious, I had a chicken chimichanga and I would dare to say it's the best one I've had since moving to Charlotte. Everyone loved their meals, and the warm chips with salsa -- we all left full and happy! My only disappointment was that I couldn't have a margarita due to being 9 months pregnant! :)"}
{"text":"I like Cantina, but I wish they'd cut their portions and prices by about 30%. Tonight I had the chicken enchiladas. They were very good and served in a mini cast iron skillet which was a nice touch. I'll be interested to see if they change anything up when they move from their current East Blvd location to Park Road Shopping Center."}
{"text":"I have been a patron of Cantina 1511 for years. When the restaurant was at the former location on East Blvd, I even rented out the back room and held a birthday party for my fiancé. We have always supported this local find, however we will not anymore.  I recently took my grandmother for a birthday lunch, and not a single item ordered was enjoyed and/or to quality of a good restaurant. We started the lunch with house margaritas, and neither one of us could drink more than two sips. They weren't mixed well, and the flavor was pure liquor... But not in a good way. The next issue was the guacamole. I will give grace here to the fact that avocados can be persnickety, and not always in season, but, apparently the guacamole recipe used there now is purely lime based. It was so heavily lime concentrated that you didn't taste anything else. It screamed for cilantro, and half the lime juice that was used. We both had different entrees. She selected the salmon salad, and I had the steak quesadilla. She said that the salmon salad tasted like it had been washed in water, and placed on the plate - zero seasoning and nothing worth mentioning. My quesadilla was burnt - flat out burnt. Tasted burnt, smelt burnt. The steak inside was grisly, and had no seasoning. Within 30 minutes to an hour of leaving, we both were regretting the stop at the restaurant... As we were burping up the food that we did nibble on. A manager needs to overhaul."}
{"text":"This is a hit or miss place based on who your server is. Last time we had an excellent waiter and hence we had a great time. Today we had a terrible waitress. We sat down and she came over for the drink order. No sooner did we order then she started with \"Your not from here are you.\" She was loud and rude but ok I wasn't going to get upset. I ordered a meal that did not list raw tomato as an ingredient because I am allergic to it. When my meal came there was raw tomato all over it. I said something to the waitress who snarked at me that she would send the manager over.  The manager never appeared nor did any drink refills. We had to flag the waitress down to get the check as she was busy standing near the door starring out into space. They really need to check on their staff. This girl was rude and inept at her job"}
{"text":"great bar.. thank you... we will come back soon"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant by far! Amazing steak quesadillas and great margaritas, very fun and relaxed atmosphere and extremely attentive and friendly staff. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I never reviewed this place I've been sooo many times!!   It's kinda annoying how hit or miss this place is though. I want to like this place but they make it difficult with the mediocre food and sometimes mind boggling service!  I have had some good experiences with the food the last time I was there I had the Garlic Shrimp which was great a big portion and the Scampi Flavored dish was exactly what I was looking for!!   I used to really enjoy the cuatro Leches but the last time they threw a Marshmallow Marenique on top and it was way too sweet and pointless because we scooped it off to the side.   I will be back but l recently have found my Spanish needs met at other restaurants!!"}
{"text":"2 stars is being generous for my overall experience today.  I hadn't been to a Cantina 1511 since it's East Blvd days so when I was in South Charlotte to meet my husband and mother-in-law for lunch, I was all in when she suggested we meet at the Rea Road location.  We met at 11:30 and were one of about 3-4 tables.  My husband and MIL had ordered queso dip before I had arrived.  They do their own interperation of queso dip, its not the delicious goodness you find at all other Mex restaurants and it was just ok.  Service was decent, a polite young girl took our order after I arrived but that quickly went downhill after more people started coming in, though it was far from busy.  Towards the end of our meal, I ended up going to the waitress station and grabbing a water pitcher as both my husband and I were completely out of water and hadn't been checked on in quite some time.  My MIL had the cobb salad and didn't have any complaints.  My husband had the Enchiladas Tejanos.  He thought it was oily and overall not enjoyable (the man rarely complains about anything.)  I had the Enchiladas De Pollo.  It completely lacked ANY kind of flavor and was drowned in the queso dip.  Literally tasted like a plain rolled up tortilla covered in cheese and not in a good way.  Our waitress didn't even ask if everything was ok when I clearly hadn't eaten half of what was on my plate and obviously didn't ask for it to be boxed up.  Wanted to like this place as a location opened a short while ago at Park Road Shopping Center, just .25 miles from my house.  VERY DISAPPOINTED and wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Way too pricey for the food quality. Underwhelming service.  I'm still unsure,  after all these years,  why this place is so popular!"}
{"text":"Very good place for table side guacamole. The chimichanga is delicious but you might share it with someone because it's big. Highly recommend the tres leches for dessert, incredibly rich and flavorful. I enjoy going to this place for dinner."}
{"text":"Just OK They make the guac at your table which is a nice touch. but in general the food is mediocre.  outdoor seating has a nice view of East Blvd. Good people watching. Avoid the 1 table surrounded by glass walls aka \"the fish bowl\""}
{"text":"Beautiful location, the place is so neat and the food was fantastic. The margarita was so tasty and service was good as well. Perfect place to visit after a NBA game o. Saturday night, not packed and great service"}
{"text":"The food is sooo good! I've been here tons of times. The tacos, chimichanga, Nutella desert and so many other dishes are amazing!"}
{"text":"I showed up to Cantina 1511 at 7:56. Upon arrival I noticed many patrons in the restaurant however was sat within 5 minutes of requesting a table (on the patio). In a matter of minutes my waitress approached the table with pleasure to serve my friends and myself. The margaritas came filled with flavor and she took our order very quickly. The food has remarkable flavor and the portions were so filling that all of my friends needed a to-go box. I would highly suggest any customer to visit this establishment and enjoy the service and quality that I was fortunate to experience."}
{"text":"I have dined at this particular Cantina a handful of times, and it is underwhelming at best. First visit - most of our appetizers were forgotten, waited 45 minutes for meals, most which were served cold. Tried again and was sat at a table with cracks filled with old, dried food. When asked to be reseated, our server nodded at a table we could move to. Server was rude and non apologetic. Ordered apps, only to be served queso that tasted like a block of salt. Server looked at us like we were crazy when we asked for it to be remade and reluctantly said sure. We only made it through appetizers before deciding to bail. We spoke to Brian (Manager) who was extremely apologetic and embarrassed about our experience. He comped our apps and provided us a card for a future meal. Giving 3 stars for the managers effort to redeem our experience."}
{"text":"The Papa Grande still rains supreme at Cantina 1511! After a long week, you can never go wrong with a good strong margarita.   Cantina has been a favorite for some time. However, I must admit that the move to Park Rd from East Blvd has left much to be desired. The previous location had a certain vibe during the warmer months. Open patio, Papa Grandes flowing, guac mixed to perfection...#issavibe. The new location seems congested, loud, and a bit too fast-casual. Not a location I would pick with better atmospheres available in the city.   FOOD Guacamole mixed at the table to spicy preference was good. Better towards the end, so ask your server to mix well. Chips always salted to perfection (little things make a big difference).   I ordered the Thai Chili Shrimp tacos with corn tortillas. They were good...nothing to rave about.   Our food came quickly and correctly, no complaints."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere of this restaurant. It is dark with a tex mex vibe, very clean the couple times I've been.  The wait staff has always been great (this location and Rea rd). My boyfriend will sometimes order a burger at dinner, but it's only on the lunch menu, they are very accommodating.  I usually get the tacos.  The margaritas are somewhat weak. I ordered the Pina margarita Saturday, not very impressed. I enjoy the chips and salsa they serve in the beginning. The chips are so good.  Again, the tacos are kind of mediocre. I recently had the Ancho chicken tacos and a saute shrimp taco as well. Not bad. But nothing too impressive."}
{"text":"Service is slow. Management and staff seemed confused and if they had any personalities, they were hiding them from their guests. I had to ask three times from another round of drinks. The food came out after 35 minutes (some of the orders anyway). One was cold, one was fine, and the other order came out 10 minutes later after we asked about it twice. So I have to put this place in the \"won't be back unless I have to\" category. Also, the food is overpriced ... after all,  it's just mexican."}
{"text":"Hardly a true TexMex joint, more like Mexican fusion. There's a few things on the menu that are really good, but most is not very TexMex style. The fish tacos are good, as well as the steak chimichanga. The chips and salsa are really good, but this place is way over priced for what you get. I'll be so glad when chuys opens up for TexMex!"}
{"text":"I am so glad Cantina 1511 moved to the Park Road shopping center. Such a great restaurant. Always great service, and the queso dip is wonderful. Usually the wait is quick, drinks are great, too!! Highly recommend for an \"upscale\" Mexican place in the greater Southpark area!"}
{"text":"We have been going to this restaurant for years, since before they moved to the current location.  A few months ago we made a reservation for a birthday party via OpenTable.  When we arrived at the restaurant, we were informed that our reservation would not be honored. Since it is one of our kids' favorite restaurants, we decided to give them another chance last week.  It had to be one of the worst experiences we've ever had in a restaurant.  So many things went wrong! The poor waitress was untrained and in over her head.  It took 45 minutes for one of our party to get the correct drink.  Most of the food was either cold, wrong or not very good! When the manager came over to check on us, we listed our complaints.  He gave us his card, with the promise of a free appetizer.  I stuck it in my wallet along with the one from the last time...doubt we'll go back."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but with poor service and unfriendly staff it wasn't worth it. They messed up the number of people on our  reservation as well."}
{"text":"- This place is average. Not as great as people make it seem. We went on a Friday night and we expected it to be packed but it wasn't so we were happy because we had forgotten to make reservations. The inside is beautiful and it's definitely a great place to go have drinks and socialize with friends. But as soon as they sat us down, that's when it all went downhill. Our server was horrible! He took our drink order and after bringing us our drinks, he then took our food order. Little did we know, we were not gonna see him again. Waited 15mins, there was no sign of him. We needed a refill with our drinks and we needed refills on the chips and salsa. Where did our server go? Who knows. We waited patiently another 5 mins, and didn't understand where he went because it was not even a busy night at all. After waiting a total of 20mins, my friend for whom we were taking out to celebrate her birthday got up, walked up to another server and asked her to come refill our drinks and to bring the manager as well. When the manager arrived, he was very professional about the whole situation and apologized for our server, and gave us a discount which we were not expecting at all. I don't remember the name of the manager but he was tall, brown hair and had glasses. Only thing that bothered us was that even though we had already spoken to the manager, our servers attitude did not change. He continued to do his own thing, refilled our drinks one time again after we got our food and didn't come back to the table until it was time to give us the bill. But get this, the whole time that he didn't come to our table, we definitely saw him going to his other tables, which I thought was very rude. He walked right passed us and couldn't even ask if we needed anything or see if things were okay. Service definitely needs improvement!  Now onto our meals, it was good but not spectacular. I was expecting a lot more from this place since there was a few good reviews about it on yelp. Don't expect authentic food, this is more American tex-mex. As for the prices of meals, they were more on the pricier side. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind paying $20 for an entree but if it's just some tacos on a plate that taste like any other place I don't think it's worth it. I won't say I'll never come back, cause I will. Every place deserves a second chance but the second time will be for drinks and tapas.   So because of the way the manager handled the situation in a well mannered way, I give this place a 2 star."}
{"text":"Here's the thing...I'm always up for Mexican.   It doesn't matter how many times I've had it for the week, if someone asks me if I want tacos....the answer is always yes.   Cantina 1511 just doesn't do it for me. I've been to this location a few different times for dinner and I've never been impressed. This last visit was no different. The service was a bit off, our waiter was new and didn't really know the menu and seemed to try a bit to hard (he hovered) after we got our food so it was warm at best when we started eating.    As for the food, I've had the tacos, quesadillas and on my most recent visit the chimichanga. Nothing here makes me say \"I'd like to have that again\". I think that's why I've tried so many different options to see if I could find one thing that really blows me away. The chips and salsa were \"meh\", if you like spicy I do recommend the jalapeno version.   Either way, this place isn't my thing. Also, \"Taco Tuesday\" here is kid's night. So keep that in mind when you make your plans. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Love this place! Came here the first time for my dad's birthday at the original location on East blvd. knocked one star off because the original location was way better. Not digging the shopping center feel. Loved the enchilada, fish and pork tacos, queso fundido and guac amazing. The burger was even delicious. I doubt you'll walk away unsatisfied. In the mood for Mexican check them out!"}
{"text":"Decided to check it out with our family of five after finishing a movie nearby. It was overpriced and the food came out cold. My husband and I ordered the chicken pollo enchiladas. They came out in a reasonable time, but were cold in the middle. They were also a bit chewy as if they had been frozen and then nuked in the microwave. I also had the  corn tortilla soup which was ok, but a bit too oily. My older child had the chopped salad, which was bland and came with beets which ruined the flavor. The salsa was good, though, with a bit of a smokey flavor.   We sent our cold dishes back, which is something we rarely do, and it was hotter when it came back. The bill for the five dishes, one of them off the child's menu, ( 2 of them the smaller portions), water to drink and no appetizers came to over $70 before tip.  Nice enough staff and pretty decor, but with so many other choices around, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for great tasting Mexican-style food beyond the traditional favorites, Cantina 1511 is the place!  Most of their entrees are based on traditional Mexican dishes rather than the \"Americanized Mexican\" food found at most restaurants.   If you get nothing else, a must-have is their Five Cheese Queso Fundido. It will change your perspective on \"cheese dip.\"  The  mix of 5 cheeses - some imported from Mexico - along with the caramelized onions and mild smoky poblano peppers in the dip really takes it to another level. Served with fresh warm nachos, it makes for a fantastic start to your meal.  My two favorite entrees are the Carne Azteca - marinated Flank Steak with garlic lime papas bravas, avocado tomatillo salsa and grilled red onion confit. Then there's the Slow-Cooked Short Rib In Negra Modelo - a tender short rib slow-cooked in Mexican Vienna lager with portobello mushrooms, white onions and arbol chiles on a bed of garlic mashed potatoes and a side of white beans. It will knock your socks off!    On our last trip, my wife got a Ground Beef Burrito. This thing was the size of a shoe and was stuffed with seasoned gound beef, charro beans, vegetable rice and topped with both Ranchero sauce and queso sauce. It was served with guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo and a lettuce and tortilla slaw. This ain't Taco Bell, folks.  The next time you crave honest, delicious Mexican, get your fix at Cantina 1511.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"A staple for good Mexican in Charlotte. There is a reason there is always a wait, especially if you visit on a nice day when the patio will be overflowing with hungry Charlotteans having a big margarita outside.  Table-side guac is fantastic, and you really can't go wrong with any dish."}
{"text":"A girlfriend and I were trying to catch a movie after work, but we had some time before and decided to give this place a try. I'd read mixed reviews about this place was I'll admit I was a bit skeptical trying this place but I was actually very pleased with my visit.   We arrived a little before 6pm and the place wasn't too packed, we were seated immediately and our waiter was prompt and attentive. The chips and salsa arrived first. The chips were warm...always a good sign! And the salsa was good too! It wasn't too chunky or full of cilantro it was delicious! We practically inhaled the first basket!    I decided to try the S'Western Nachos with chicken. The nachos come topped with your choice of chicken or beef and black beans, queso, caramelized onions, sour cream, guacamole and cheese. I ordered the half size portion but it was MORE than enough for a good meal. They added a lot of chicken, almost every bite I had included some chicken. I loved them! I would absolutely order them again....but next time with a margarita because I'll have more time!   I'm going to have to go back and try something else off the menu but so far they win my approval."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Cantina 1511 last weekend. When we walked in the door we were immediately pleased with the decor, its fun and bright and the restaurant feels spacious. I ordered off of the brunch menu, Eggs Benedict served in avocado slices, it was fantastic! My husband ordered the Mexican street food sampler and he loved it. Our waitress was friendly and attentive and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"30 minute wait on a Friday turned into 90.  I'm not saying that is something i don't expect on a busy weekend night, but if it's 90, tell me 90 or something close to it.  I walked over to a Wendy's and ate a hamburger so i didn't expire during the wait.  Service was good, food was excellent and fresh Mexican fare. The margarita flight special at 15.00 dollars equates to a 21oz margarita. Not a great deal and a bit showy for my taste. Variety is the spice, but I can do one margarita at a time if it costs half as much."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, great service.  Interesting drink menu with a good variety of flavors.  Guac made at the table and queso - good starters.  Ordered fajitas and chimi steak burrito--well presented and ok/good.  Not an inexpensive place, a little on the pricey side given flavors and quality.  Overall ok, but, prefer the flavors I get at La Unica in Huntersville better at around 50-60% of the price."}
{"text":"This location is pretty disappointing. The server seemed to not really want to be bothered and was not very helpful and was quite dry. Ordered a chicken and jalapeño bacon quesadilla which came to me with not one drop of bacon. The server tried to tell me that the bacon is small...it was actually non existent. She then commented that the cook was new and that she would ask someone to talk to him because he didn't speak English...which i Thought was a strange and unnecessary information to tell a customer. She then offered to bring me out a side of bacon so I could put my quesadilla together properly on my own. Pretty dismal. The margaritas were also just average or a bit below. My friend got a quesadilla with crab and avocado and it was manly cheese and a couple bits of crab meat in one or 2 pieces of the quesadilla. Even though this is literally like a mile from my house it will probably be one of my last choices for dining out due to the service and poor food quality."}
{"text":"We went here with a work function. There were about 12 of us so we got the use of half of a private room, the other half was being used by another group.   I got the chorizo sandwich with a cup of tortilla soup. The sandwich was good but very messy and very greasy. The soup I thought was very good.   The highlight of the meal to me was the salsa and queso. The queso comes with a little tealight to keep it warm. If that tealight goes out have someone re-light it soon, because the queso will become thick and not easy to eat once it gets cold.   Overall a great place for some Mexican, but I think I would rather go to a more authentic restaurant."}
{"text":"From my other reviews perhaps you can tell I'm big into atmosphere. This place is beautiful. There were plenty of spots open at the bar so my friend and I sat near this amazing wall of wine and assorted accents. It was nice and dark and our table was lit by an oil candle. Our server was amazing. The guac alone is worth the trip! I've taken away one star because the main course wasn't great. I had the regular chicken enchilladas. My friend's food looked good but the rice and beans is more like beans and beans. And more beans."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and have never had a worse experience than I did today. We waited an hour for our food (at lunch), had no chip refills (we ordered guacamole and queso) and no drink refills. We paid for our food before it even came out and when I brought all of this to the attention of the manager he said he 'would give a few of the girls free guacamole coupons'. Needless to say, I was less than impressed and would rather go to one of the twenty other restaurants in the area for lunch in the future.   Oh and there was no apology for the terrible service and timing."}
{"text":"Many mentioned the Barbados platter, but they just ran out.  So the waitress suggested the 3 taco meal.  Well see.  Hoping for the best, meaning g better than TB.  Loud live music, so good thing they have no customers and plenty of seats.  I'll update when it's over."}
{"text":"Great dinner last night. Good atmosphere, friendly staff, and the enchiladas where excellent! You would think that good Mexican food would be easy to find in this city, but it's not! I've been here several times and I've  always had the same good experience. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Cantina is authentic Mexican food.  It is awesome.  I have been to Central Mexico for cooking classes.  Mexican food is highly complex.  Cantina captures that, which is much different from the typical places that are just stuffing seasoned been into a tortilla on a scalding hot plate.  The guacamole is amazing.  I have no idea how this place has received some of these reviews."}
{"text":"Excellent food + excellent service = super duper satisfied couple!  We did want the table side guac and I ordered the 'Pollo Laredo' and wife ordered the 'Enchiladas De Dennis'. We were both very satisfied, al though I would have ordered something if I were her. We both have bit of a sweet tooth, so to end it all off nicely, we ordered the 'Cuatro leches'. Holy *%#&, we both LOVED the desert!  So, if you want good tex-mex in a casual, yet excellent service ambiance, then you have to go here."}
{"text":"We came up here from Rock Hill and we were hungry and love Mexican food, so we thought we'd give this place a try. It did have a \"chain feel\" even though there are only 2 locations. We had the fajitas. I was not really that impressed at all. The fajitas were just okay, we've definitely had better at chain restaurants in California like El Toritos. Someone here on Yelp said the chips and salsa were good - and I would strongly DISagree! They were passable and the salsa was NOT. The salsa was pretty much for local gringos, not at all for California gringo transplants - we LOVE good Mexican food, and I don't think I will return here. If you want good authentic Mexican food, this isn't the place. If you want \"americanized\" Mexican food, then this is a good spot for you. Our service was great, top notch, so nothing lacking here for us other than our tastebuds."}
{"text":"Eat and drink here!  I'm from Europe and staying in Charlotte every second month. I'm used to good food at home where people put passion into the cooking. It's unusual that I go back to resturants in US but this is one of them.  This place has great food, not typical mexican but more upscale and the service is great :)"}
{"text":"As close as you can get to high end Mexican( is there such a thing?) in this town. Great location, good service, ample parking & a braised pork taco to die for! The waiters will make fresh guacamole right in front of you! One of the places I take out of town family & friends."}
{"text":"I used to come here every Friday night when it was located on East Blvd. It was honestly one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte! Their guacamole, chopped salad, blood orange margarita, ahhhh.... The good 'ol days.  I have visited the new Park Road location about 5 times and I don't think I will ever go back again after receiving such awful service. I overlooked it at first because I loved it too much. But it becomes hard to ignore when you can barely get your server's attention all night.  This week, we visited Cantina and paid almost $10 for guacamole, which we really enjoy there, and the waitress didn't bring us chips for 20 minutes. How annoying. The food also does not seem fresh or as high quality as it used to be- especially for the price. On one date night, we placed our order and the waiter brought out our food in less than five minutes- like it had just been heated up in the microwave! Yuck.  I am very disappointed in the direction that Cantina has gone, and I am so sad to say that I will not be visiting again. If you are considering Cantina, I would encourage you to search a little harder to find another great Mexican place with better service and quality :)"}
{"text":"A great place to enjoy authentic Tex mex food   Take it from me, you will like this place. Nachos and fajitas are amazing"}
{"text":"Cantina 1511 is one of my 'go-to' Mexican spots. I actually liked their old location on East Blvd much better ... the ambiance and decor made the whole experience better for me. I think there is more seating now though ... so shorter wait times trump the mediocre decor.   Went back for my second trip to the new location this passed weekend ... make a reservation and had to wait about 10 minutes to get a table. On a crazy business Friday night at 7:30 ... i'm tottaly oaky with this. Our server knew his stuff, and our glasses were never empty.   Chip and salsa are good, nothing extraordinary. Ordered the Crab & Goat Cheese Croquetas and was very impressed. I can't bring my self to ever try anything but the tacos for me entree, because they're so damn good. The Marco Polo taco never fails to disappoint (must be the jalapeno bacon!). I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Had dinner with a large group tonight and everything was excellent. Service was great and food came out fast!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican in town! Service is always great and the food is even better. My fav tacos are the Thai Chili Shrimp and Marco Polo. Thanks Rachel for the recommendations and great service!"}
{"text":"I would've given this place 5 stars because the food was probably the best Mexican food I'd ever eaten but the service wasn't up to par.  Granted that we went during the Queen's Feast, which we totally forgot that it was going on.  I've worked in many restaurants and have also worked in a nice restaurant that participated in Charlotte's Queen's Feast and I know how busy you are but I also know that you shouldn't make your guest feel rushed ESPECIALLY since you didn't spiel the Queen's Feast specials to them and they ordered off the regular menu.  My boyfriend, daughter, and my baby went and waited for 1.5 hours (we were told before hand that the wait would be 45 min!)to be seated.  The hostesses were nice and we didn't mind waiting but with two kids that was quite a long time considering we were going to eat at the Firebirds next door but decided on a different restaurant because they told us the wait would be less. Any way, once seated our server was a male and right off the bat I can tell he was rushing us, my boyfriend asked if there were any specials and he told us they didn't for that day.  Never once did he informed us that it was Queen's Feast and the restaurant was featuring a menu for the event.  He got us our appetizers and our entree's (very quickly)  and everything was delicious.  I got the Frontier Fajita with Chicken and Steak, it was probably the best Fajita dish I've ever eaten and it came with all the condiments I would have wanted to add to my Fajita.  The seasoning was perfect and the portions was excessive.  My boyfriend got the Barbacoa dish and he is a big fan of Barbacoa, he said that was the most delish dish of Barbacoa he's had.  My daughter had the kids dish, Chicken Quesadilla and fries, she really enjoyed her dinner. We didn't finish most of our foods and asked for to go boxes. The server came by a few times to see how  things were going, he offered to box up our food for us.  I knew he was probably busy and weeded and was unsure if I wanted him to box our food up but my boyfriend said \"yes\".  I was still eating so he boxed up my boyfriend's dish, my daughter's, and our appetizers. My baby needed his little hands washed so I left with my daughter to go to the bathroom, When I came back, my food was gone, I assumed our server boxed it up for me while I was gone. We ordered the Quatro Leches cake and it was divine. It was perfectly made, very buttery and moist with I'm guessing is a marshmellow type topping that's slightly browned on top. My boyfriend went ahead and paid for our dinner and I have to say, it certainly didn't hurt our wallet!  Great food for a great price. My boyfriend asked if ALL the food was in the bag and the server said yes so we didn't question it. But before my boyfriend can even eat a bite of our dessert, our server came back and asked if he can box up the dessert, my boyfriend's response was \"umm no, I'm still eating\".  I know you are busy but you as a server still need to ensure your guest have a good dining experience. I was ready to go at that point ,  We left Cantina and went home. When we got home and checked our food, our server did not box up my fajita. The food was also just thrown in the box. I was very disappointed as I really didn't get to eat too much with having to take care of my 8 mth old. I was really looking forward to finishing my dinner at home! There was a lot left too....so I was a sad bunny with no fajita. I had to make me some noodles instead!  So over all, I like the restaurant and love the food, but...the service could've been better,  And I know its restaurant week but your service should never be less. We left a good tip too...we always do.  We will be going back and hopefully the service will be better. :)"}
{"text":"Just experienced the worst food at Cantina 1511 in Stonecrest. So disappointed with the Crab and Avocado Quesadilla. My daughter and I have enjoyed them here in the past. The Quesadillas had barely any crab meat or avocado. It was primarily large globs of cheese."}
{"text":"Terrible service. They advertised it was $5 Margaritas on Tuesday's and when asked for it they couldn't explain what was $5. Charged $2 extra for ice and couldn't explain the bill. Poor waiter wasn't even trained properly."}
{"text":"Forget slow, no matter what time of day, or the weather. This place is super popular.    But the servers are cheery and down to earth and just after your drinks arrive the busboy will set a fresh warm bowl of chips and cool salsa on the table.  Two salsas actually.  The red salsa (salsa roja) has punch.  You can taste an exciting splash of fresh individual flavors instead of the usual tomato-onion-lemon.  And it also comes with a spicy green salsa (salsa de tomatillo aka salsa verde) that has a great spicy kick.    We ordered the ground beef tacos and the waitress didn't flinch when I asked for things like \"no onions\" and \"no sour cream\" and they came to our table perfectly.  I like it when both the servers and the cooks pay attention.  Needless to say the tacos were impeccable.  Flavorful and fresh.  They came with a side of cilantro rice with a few beans as garnish.  I could say it was slightly overcooked, but it was a nice alternative to the usual spoonful of plain beans and rice.    They have more tequilas than your average saloon!   An impressive list of martinis, margaritas and enough tequilas for several rounds of shots without using the same tequila twice.  Just remember the old saying \"One tequila, two tequila, three tequila, floor...\" before ordering too many.  At $22 for lunch and all we had were tacos and diet cokes, it was a little high, but more of a unique experience than I expected and well worth the investment.  I'll save Cantina for special occasions, especially for dinner, because I know when I go to Cantina I'll have a great time in an upscale atmosphere and there are plenty of things to try on the menu.  I  have to agree with Tony C's review, it's the Banana Republic / Club Monaco of Mexican restaurants. You won't be out of place dressing up to dine here.  But they are very consistent and this is a great date spot."}
{"text":"I had no idea that Blue had become the lively, festive Cantina 1511. The \"Catrina\"/Frida Khalo entry way is spectacular. The decor is bright. I ordered \"la flaca\", a skinny margarita. It's perfect for the person that doesn't want a too sweet drink. The bar staff seemed overwhelmed at times. They did their best to accommodate everyone, but something seemed off. I didn't order food on this visit, but the dishes I saw looked appetizing. Me encanta la comida mexicana, regresaré!"}
{"text":"This was first visit here and we arrived on a ridiculously busy night. Thought we were doing well to have reservations, but due to large party had to wait well over 30 minutes past the reservation time. Also the restaurant cancelled reservation so we did not earn points for visit. Very strange and no explanation as to why??? The server was not as attentive as we hoped,yet was pleasant and  knew menu well,plus  made nice recommendations.  Prices were a tad bit higher than quality. Food was not bad just nothing special. May return, just not weekend evening. Management really needed to do a better job with staff availability and booking large parties. Wait times without quasi reservation were 60-120 minutes. Little noisy, buy okay with us."}
{"text":"A great Mexican food experience! My spouse and I have been here several times and try to bring visiting relatives and friends here too! The food is always cooked to order and the table side guacamole is some of the best I've ever had!   My only complaint would be quicker, more efficient service. Although always friendly, they are sometimes distracted and a bit on the slow side.   Overall, a must for more authentic style Mexican food if you can bare mediocre service."}
{"text":"My sister and I ate there yesterday.  The chicken enchiladas were not good.  Left a funky taste in our mouths.  When we got home we both got sick.  Called and talked to a manager today.  Basically said they would do nothing for us.  Needless to say.  We will not be back !!!"}
{"text":"Get the tacos with the soft white flour shell, biggest drawback is the atmosphere at least in the bar area way too dark."}
{"text":"I would like to update and say that the manager reached out to me to make things right. While I won't be phoning in my order any time soon I do like the food at Cantina and will continue to eat there in person and order online. Thanks for listening and providing good customer service after a bad experience!"}
{"text":"Dinner last night with 10 people.  The food was good even though they screwed the order up.  A little bit pricey but the serving was generous.  The chips and salsa were great.  The atmosphere was laid back.  I'll go back."}
{"text":"This was about as good as it gets.   First, I was happy to utilize the free valet parking, I really love this more and more as I become more pregnant.   We were seated in the back section where Jamal and Chris were working together on the area. Both were amazing but we got to spend more time with Jamal and I have to say, I will be requesting him on our next visit.   Having been wanting a margarita, I talked the hubs into getting the trio that was on special. Jamal helped with this persuasion and picked out a perfect combo for him. Since I was not able to drink any myself, I was happy that he seemed to enjoy them.   We decided to split the fajitas for 2 and started with the salad. This was amazing. I was afraid I was going to be disappointed b/c I was not getting guac. but as soon as I took one bite of this salad I forgot all about it.   The fajitas themselves were quite tasty and contained an array of veggies, not just the typical onions and peppers. The hubs enjoyed this but I am grossed out by mushrooms so I had to keep looking and picking to make sure none made their way into my mouth!   We ended the meal with the Churros and it was a perfect end and totally satisfied my sweet tooth.   I am excited to go back and try more things on the menu and, eventually, have some of those margaritas myself!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit here and likely my last. Bar tender had no personality. Food was mediocre at best. My food was room temperature, would not melt cheese which was inside my enchilada.  My margarita had a metallic taste   Ugh"}
{"text":"Kris with a K is fantabulous! Love sitting on the covered patio with my pup and the fans blowing in the summer. Great vegetarian/vegan/pescatarian options! Great cocktails! Love it."}
{"text":"I love Cantina 1511 - we go here all the time, and by and large have always had wonderful experiences, especially when we dine in the restaurant.  I do, though, want to warn y'all about their online ordering - I've used it about 3 times now, and they've never got my order correct. Tonight, for example, I ordered 2 Ancho Pollo tacos, no pico de gallo and not lettuce, and then another 2 taco plate of 1 Ancho Pollo, 1 Marco Pollo. What we received was 2 orders of the 2-taco plates, both with 2 Ancho Pollo tacos with everything - so they didn't affect the modifications to the first order, and they got the 2nd plate only half correct. When I've ordered by phone, the order has always been correct, so I guess I'll forgo the online ordering if favor of the good old fashioned telephone - since clearly they don't have their house in order there.  Love you, Cantina, but if you're going to enter the 21st century, I encourage you to get it right. It's just annoying to offer online ordering and get the order more than 1/2 wrong."}
{"text":"It had been a while since we had been to Cantina 1511.  In fact, I really don't remember the last time, it was that long.  Also, for some reason it seems like I can't remember a particularly great mexican meal that I have had in Charlotte.  Most of the mexican food that I eat is made at home and satisfies me.  Maybe I don't know where the good places are?  Anyway, we stopped by for a drink, in this case a couple of margaritas, but I was looking at the food menu and got tempted into ordering a couple of tacos.  The al pastor pork taco and the carne asada steak taco were calling my name.  Both tacos were excellent, but I would get the al pastor only next time, as the cabbage, pineapple and cilantro really went well together.  The tacos came with beans and rice, which I enjoyed, but I was already overly stuffed with the tacos.  I had ordered a lunch portion at 10$ and it was a very good value for the amount of food that I received.  Sitting outside on the patio was nice despite the heat.   Overall, very happy that I gave Cantina another try and I will return sooner this time."}
{"text":"We met some friends for dinner there last night. The hostess was very accomodating and said that she could go ahead and seat us but we decided to wait for our other friends to arrive so we stopped by the bar.  The bartender was a little distracted, &  I didn't have a chance to order a beverage before our friends arrived.  But, no matter since we were seated immediately anyway.    I would have to give our server 3 stars for service.  Maybe we just caught him on a bad night, but he was not attentive about our drinks and did not seem overly helpful when we had questions about specific items on the menu.    Also, one member of our party asked if she could have onions left off a taco and he said absolutely not.  I know  that a lot of chef's are \"offended\" when patrons ask for changes to a dish, but it sort of leaves a bad taste in my mouth when restuarants are not willing to entertain any kind of special request.  After all, a place like this you would expect the food to be cooked to order...  so if someone wants their taco without onions, it should not present a huge problem.   While there were a couple of stand-out  items, overall, I would have to rate the food just 3 stars for this visit.   Of course, we started the evening with house-made tortilla chips served with a side of pickled veggies and fresh salsa.   We also placed an order for Queso Fundido (imported Mexican cheeses melted with fresh herbs and chilies - $5 for a small, $7 for a large).  Without question, that is the best queso I have ever eaten. 5 stars for this dish alone - I would go back anytime just for that!  The queso fundido is served with a side of soft flour tortillas- which was perfect with a little of the vegetable mixture and a big scoop of queso. Yummo!   I decided to order off the Authentic Mexican menu rather than the TexMex menu.  There were several items I really wanted to try, but our waiter said the Tacos Dorados were his favorite, so I decided to go with that.  The Tacos Dorados are described as \"Crispy shrimp, crab and scallion tacos. Topped with Mexican crema, cabbage, and Valentina hot sauce. Served with Mexican vegetable rice and black beans D-$12\".    First off, the mexican vegetable rice & black beans were absolutely DELICIOUS. I am a huge fan of black beans and theirs were seasoned perfectly.    However, sadly I was less thrilled with the actual main dish.  The taco shells were fabulous - obviously freshly made in house and appeared to be deep fried after the shrimp & crab mixture was put in.  The shrimp-crab mix had a pretty good flavor but was a bit on the dry side.  The real problem for me was that the Mexican Crema and Valentina Hot Sauce was Missing In Action - there was a little on top of the entree but not enough to enjoy on each taco.  I think the dish would have greatly been improved if these 2 elements were more abundant. The mixture on the inside seemed to lack any cheese, so the crema was really needed to give it that extra flavor and texture.  I also like things on the spicy side and it seems our chef either forgot the spicy sauce or thought we couldn't handle it - so I had to use the salsa that came with our chips along with the stuff out of the bottle to give it a little kick.   One of my friends ordered the Cantina Chimichanga (described as a Crispy burrito filled with a choice of chicken or steak, black beans, pico de gallo, Mexican vegetable rice and mixed cheeses. Topped with Ranchero and Chile con queso sauce. Choice of grilled vegetables or rice and beans $12).  This turned out to be a gigantic burrito! Better bring your appetite if you're planning to order this one (or you'll have one big doggy bag!)    But, all-in-all, I would like to go back and try some of the other menu items...and I will definitely go back just for that fabulous Queso!!"}
{"text":"I am pretty picky about guacamole, but I do enjoy their tableside guac. Only complaint is that sometimes I would like a little more bite & a little more tomato in mine.  The chips are always fresh & salsa is tasty.   The last couple of visits, I ended up getting a ginormous salad with iceberg & romaine letttuce, diced chicken, tomatoes, jimaca,  black beans, garbanzos, guacamole, tostado shells, etc.     Did I mention how ginormous this salad is?  Seriously, it is huge  & I cannot eat it all.   I also enjoy their enchiladas here...although, they recently changed the menu and I can no longer get my fav enchilada so that was a bit of a bummer. Oh well, plenty of other options here, so it's not a deal breaker.   On our last couple of visits, our service has been fast and friendly."}
{"text":"You start out with a great amount of chips and salsa.  First place that gives you enough chips. Ordered margs but one was suppose to be without salt. Both came with salt.  Ordered the churros for dessert and they had plenty of them but they seemed over fried and only came with the raspberry sauce no chocolate like the menu says.  It was a slow night but food came out really fast but not correct. Would have rather had correct food and a little longer wait time."}
{"text":"Was the best Mexican food in Charlotte by far. Has fallen off recently, but well worth a visit anyway. Fiesta!!"}
{"text":"Cantina's food is awesome. I've never had anything I didn't like. Their salsa is some of the best. But the service at all 3 of their locations is consistently just bad and has just gotten worse... it's really a shame. We gave the Rea Rd location another try tonight and after receiving our drinks is styrofoam cups with lids (because the half full restaurant ran out of glasses(?)) and waiting about 30 minutes for our food after ordering, they still managed to get 2 of the 4 meals our party ordered wrong...  We've been here before where we've waited 30 minutes for our food only to be told the waiter forgot to put it into the system so he just submitted it and it'll only be a few more minutes... we've sat with empty water glasses for what feels like an eternity... had rude waiters that don't know their own menu or specials... the list goes on... it's honestly like the servers here have never eaten in a restaurant themselves and don't understand the level of service they should provide. Because at the end of the day, it's just not that hard... good service makes up for pretty much everything else that could go wrong...it's just so essential and so missing from these restaurants. But the food is good so what can I say? We're suckers and keep coming back hoping something has changed... but I think this may have been our last visit..."}
{"text":"I've tried making guacamole at home with everything Cantina 1511 uses for the tableside preparation, but it must be a mystery, because theirs is impossible to recreate. The menu is extensive and loaded with more choices than Netflix on a good day. The recent menu redesign has lots of bright colors and looks like a Post-It note cram session, prompting many bad memories (geology finals) and the waiter promising any kind of guidance with the menu/counseling for bad exam experiences. Service: 1. Redesign: 0.  The menu breaks down into different categories: comida autentica mexicana (which lists Mexican specialties in Spanish) and Tex Mex Standards. Picking out just a few tacos from the Magnificent Seven is tricky, but the pescado frito (fish) taco is pretty spectacular. I like the creative fish tacos or the carnitas, but the ancho chicken salad is my favorite. Tossed with chopped romaine lettuce and garbanzo beans, the flavors are familiarly Mexican, but the dish is fresh and just as filling as an enchilada. Prices are a little bit higher, reflecting a quality difference with other Tex-Mex joints, which I think is pretty justifiable.  The inside's a little noisy, but just like the menu, the paper mobile decorations and a banging Spanish poster of Gone With the Wind are a contemporary update of the Tex Mex cantina. Whenever I'm in town, my sister and I make a point to stop here."}
{"text":"Cantina is a great place to go drink during the day.  You know when you are trying to decide where can you go and sit outside on a beautiful day, this is that place, however, sometimes service and margaritas can be spotty.  Their chips tonight were better than usual they were lighter than my last visit, big improvment, very crispalicious.   Our server was slack.  Anybody that says they don't like a snooty waiter, I always say, I would rather have an efficient surly waiter anyday than a nice slack ass.  It was the typical horror story of slow on giving the menus, slow on taking the orders, not giving us flatware, having to ask the food runner for flatware. I gave her cash as soon as she came around because I knew getting the check was going to take some time.   About the margaritas, one day, there was fresh squeezed juice on the bar and the bartender made a margarita with it, I have been back a couple of times to get that same margarita, but what I get is a simple syrup almost clear margarita.  Not the same juice mixture of that day.    I am not completly going to write off Cantina, I like their food, I am going to restrict my hours of going there from 11a-5p.  I will find that margarita again.    About the food, I always get the same thing, one Al Pastor taco with rice and beans."}
{"text":"Trash. Poor bartender didn't have any help. Inattentive manager just walked around commenting about the bartender slacking while not helping in any way. Bartender had several patrons at bar with us and a couple tables while also trying to manage to go orders and reservations because the hostess was also elsewhere. This led to poor service. No fault of hers but food service is a team effort. We were there at 4:00 on a Monday afternoon, the restaurant was not busy. Dirty tables all around our section of the restaurant that were not attended to. Both of our orders were wrong but we didn't bother to complain because it seemed pointless and figured no one would help since everyone in this restaurant had a \"one for all\" mentality."}
{"text":"Met a girlfriend for dinner while I was in town. I made a reservation on opentable to make sure we had a seat. The service staff were nice and very attentive. We both ordered from their taco menu. I love that you can mix and match :-) I had the carne asada and tilapia taco, both were delicious! You won't be disappointed!   I liked it so much I took my family back two days later :-) make sure you get the fresh guacamole!"}
{"text":"I don't give five stars very often, but had to give it up to Cantina 1511 after having an AMAZING dinner there for Charlotte Restaurant week this month.  Typically, I wouldn't choose to go to a Mexican place for an expensive dinner since I believe you can get really good Mexican food for cheap at other places, but this place had good reviews and was worth a shot so we went.  Everything we had for dinner was delicious.  We started off with the guacamole.  I was at first disappointed with the small portion, but as soon as I saw the portions of the rest of our meal, I was glad I didn't waste my appetite on just the first course!  I had their salad while my husband had the soup and both were very tasty.  We were already getting pretty full from appetizers when our main courses came out and they were just...OMG.  If you go, you MUST try the short rib.  Juicy, tender, full of flavor and HUGE!  We ended up having to take most of our meal home because we wanted to save it for another day!  The server was also so amazing and attentive.  I mentioned I was allergic to nuts and the dessert they had slated for the Restaurant Week menu had nuts and he was able to replace it with the bread pudding instead, and the bread pudding was literally the best that I've ever had in my entire life.  I would go back just to have the bread pudding again.  Again, I tend to be pretty critical of places and even some of my favorite places I've only given four stars, but had such a great experience here, it definitely deserves five stars and another visit!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times and it hasn't disappointed yet. \"El Vaquero\" quesadilla is great! Take note that it is spicy. The sangria is delicious as well . Seated outside with no wait on a Sunday at 5:30 pm. We had our two boys with us who are very well behaved and both had their chicken quesadillas with fruit. Out of the 3 times I have been here it has not been a \"McDonald's playground\" as someone else wrote."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see the wide range of reviews on this place. It's not your typical Tex-Mex restaurant. It's an upscale restaurant in an upscale shopping center. If you are looking for a cheese enchilada and a ground beef taco, this is not your place. Excellent and adventuresome menu. We LOVED everything we tried!  But get at least one dish that includes their shrimp. Best I have ever had anywhere, including NOLA!  Do yourself a favor and get a Papa Grande Margarita.  This was recommended to us by our very fun waiter, Max. We had a delightful meal and drinks and will be back. You should give them a try."}
{"text":"Love this place! The queso is pure cheesy deliciousness, the barbacoa pork is incredibly juicy, and the sweet tea is a definite 10! Bejng from the west coast I was dying to try some Carolina BBQ and definitely have nothing but positive things to say about this place. The decor is also charming and service great."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Alcoholic beverages were good.... don't sit in the patio! Unless you want to eat flies and gnats."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Cantina 1511 in years and am disappointed to see how much it has changed.   Our waiter was a pain and did not want to tell my mom the price of the brisket that is no longer listed on the menu. After asking about 5 times and him constantly expressing his dissatisfaction with the restaurant taking it off the menu, he finally gave us an answer. My mom loved the brisket...she always does.   I ordered the guacamole as an appetizer and it was yummy. You can't really mess up table side guacamole since you can tell the waiter/waitress what to add. For my entree, I had the Crab and Avocado Quesadilla. Nothing special and it came with no sides. Although it isn't listed on the menu, the quesadillas come in two sizes (small and large). I think I got the small, but who knows.   Cantina 1511 used to be on my list of places to go every time I return to Charlotte but I think this will be my last time."}
{"text":"Well, after perusing the Queen City for burritos and free chips and salsa on any occasion, Cantina 1511 has popped up on my radar a few times. Known for pitchers of sangria and fresh, tableside guac, it might as well be a bulls eye.   We've stumbled in on multiple occasions to this location. Friday nights, Saturday nights and Sunday afternoons. Optimal time for us is a weekend afternoon. Not buzzing with margarita vultures and other seekers of neon drinks with umbrellas in them. We're just here for the food, typically. However, I've seen quite a few neon blue margaritas floating around. They must be doing something right. Just not my cup of tea....er...booze.   My wife and I love the mushroom and goat cheese quesadilla. Perfectly simple and just enough pungent flavor to keep everything interesting. The goat cheese works perfectly with crispy, buttery outer shell of the tortilla. It's somewhat phyllo-esque upon each bite. So flaky and fragile. The mushrooms could be sauteed a bit better, but the flavors are all there. Huge win.   The tableside guac is an absolute win. Perfect amount for a table of four or two starvacious diners. Balanced well with tomatoes, onion and citrus. I'm not a huge fan of guac that has too many additives. Cantina does it up right. Smooth avocado and the rest of the veggies take care of the chunky aspects. My only gripe is the chips they give you to dip with. Not flat. All folded and intermingling with one another. I want my chips to be separate. Playing by their own rules. Not hugging one another. The flavor is all there. Just too much fraternization.   Love Cantina. Now, to expand my horizons and check out some of this ever-present booze they have going on. Cheers!"}
{"text":"The Al Pastor tacos and mojitos are outstanding. I ate here 2 nights in a row. (Why mess with a good thing?)"}
{"text":"Last minute decided to go out for dinner so I called ahead for a 645pm Rez and actually got one! I was surprised since this place is always jammin and we usually get stuck at the bar. Anyhow, the waitress and hostess were both friendly and accommodating.  Both of us starving so I immediately ordered the guacamole that's prepared table side.  Nice little touch, always consistent in flavor and enough for 4 to share. A good value for $8. My entree of redfish(really, redfish is back?) was cooked perfectly, tender and still juicy.  It was smothered with roasted artichokes in a garlic butter sauce. I love garlic but somebody overdosed the sauce making it bitter and slightly displeasing.  My wife's brisket enchiladas were tender, slightly sauced, and plenty of food. We had ordered house margaritas with Patron.  Pretty good in tanginess but for a $12 drink I would not expect to have sour mix or OJ.  It takes away from the tequila. We will return, food is usually good and plentiful, but I have to question the value. Totally not related but what is up with kids dining with headphones on and watching IPads?  Can't parent talk to their children during a social dining experience? How are these kids going to learn to act in public? Really; don't get me started.  Maybe we should share the no smoking in public and tack on no electronics at the dinner table!"}
{"text":"I love Cantina 1511 so I was super excited for this one to open.  The service needs some improvement. We got our food before we got our drinks.  The couple next to us got the wrong order and when they notified the waitress she said she thought that's what they ordered.  She then said it would take 15 more minutes depending on how many more orders were in front of them.  They got their order to go instead.  When our food came it wasn't that great.  I always get the chicken tostada salad and the shell was stale.  The rice was pretty bland too.  I will give it another shot in a few weeks.  Hopefully it will be as good as the other locations."}
{"text":"While certainly one of your more upscale Mexican restaurants in town, Cantina 1511 has lived up to my expectations on a regular basis and has become a regular spot for me when I need to get my fix of imported draft beer, chips and guacamole, or a nice margarita.  I've been here quite a few times and have had brunch, dinner, and even takeout (Pro Tip: use the takeout spot right in front of the restaurant to make a speedy getaway). Some of my favorite dishes include the guacamole which they mix fresh by the table side, the chicken tortilla soup, and any selection of the tacos (Marco Polo is always a solid choice). They also have a fun brunch menu I suggest checking out if you are interested, which is impressive considering all of the competition close by. The space is large and can accommodate both large and small parties and I would recommend reservations during peak dinner times.  I will admit that service here can be hit or miss from time to time. During my most recent experience, my wife and I went to sit on their patio to enjoy the nice weather with a beer and some guac. I realize it was towards the end of the day on a Sunday, however our waiter often went MIA and seemed like he couldn't care less about us. This was an abnormal experience for us here, so I didn't penalize my overall score. I do plan to be back and hope to try more of their menu in the future."}
{"text":"I have come to Cantina for Salsa night several times and I have a blast every time. The bartenders are awesome, management is attentive, and the music is great. Not to mention the chips and salsa are fantastic. I recommend the Mexican mule- new twist to the mule that gives it a lot more flavor."}
{"text":"At least I know everything will be good (so far).  I hate eating bad Mexican food because I love it so much.  Authentic seems hard to find here, but I'll settle for consistent reminiscence of it.  The ground beef tacos and cilantro rice are great, the salsa actually is not runny, and the guac is good.  On the weekend, the chicken with mole special was pretty good though I could only make it through a few bites after all the pre-dinner snacking.  No More Chips!"}
{"text":"I had the Al Pastor Marinated Salmon - it was absolutely AMAZING! The salmon melts in your mouth and the sauce + goat cheese + potatoes + spinach go perfectly together!  definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"I was emailed and assured I'd receive gift certificates, and have yet to receive them."}
{"text":"Fancy and mexican restaurant should never be in a statement together. Save yourself a few bucks and go to Zapata's instead. The food leaves you wanting more in seasoning and wondering why you spent so much for a subpar plate."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food, Good Margaritas! Popular though, so you usually have to wait.  Save room for the tres leches cake!  They do table side guacamole prep too... and Ritas by the pitcher, if I remember right...  I really also liked the Marco Pollo tacos, but as Carmen knows, you cannot order only TWO! They come in threes! :)"}
{"text":"Chef Frank Scibelli, chef and co-cowner of Cantina 1511  knows authenticity.   The ingredients used here are local, fresh, and of the highest caliber. In fact, they come from his very own garden. I love the traditional dishes- the chips are tasty and never-ending and the guacamole is magical. All portions are very generous. Even better, I do not feel guilty about eating at a restaurant that is conscientious of where its food comes from. The red meat is farm raised (/grazed) and there is even a gluten-free menu.   Frank Scibelli really cares about executing authentic cuisine to people who care about more than fine dining, but also consumption.  (Scibelli also owns and is chef at Mama Ricotta's).  Dinner with drinks may run about thirty+ a head.  I have eaten on the patio and found the dining area to be a little darker than I'd like, but the music was nice. .  I avoid the Cantina on the weekends as parking is can be pain when the restaurant is busy. They offer free valet."}
{"text":"We visited on a Friday night around midnight and the restaurant was emptier than we expected but the service and food were phenomenal.   I ordered a frozen strawberry margarita and carne asada fries sans meat. My boyfriend ordered the nachos, sans meat as well, but his personal favorite was the salsa that accompanies the free chips you receive after being seated. I have to say I've been to quite a few Mexican/ cantina-style restaurants and rank the salsa here pretty high on the list.   The food was prepared fairly quickly and tasted great, their queso sauce is pretty good and I'll probably order extra on my next visit.   The decor and ambiance are beautiful and I enjoyed the music that was playing during our visit. I look forward to returning for many more delicious meals!"}
{"text":"Have been  here a couple times and it's always been very good.  Their salsa is to die for, luckily they sell it so I can take some home.  One of the best in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I had a chance to go Cantina 1511 this afternoon for lunch.  This is about the 5th or 6th time I've been to this local neighborhood gem.  Its hard to  bring something new to the conversation that hasnt already been mentioned...  Highlights: *The chips and salsa are simply amazing. *I usually get the Carne Asada Burrito, the dinner portion is $12 and is worth every last dime.  Here's a little hint, you can get the burritos topped with BOTH queso and ranchero sauce!!  How can you go wrong?!?!  The burrito is probably a little \"fatter\" than what you would think (see pics) but thats only because it is stuffed with tasty, Mexican goodness! *The table-side Guac is simply real.  Its made at your time and you BETTER ask for it a spicy!  I usually always get the side of guac for $2 if I choose not to go with the full-out appetizer.   *Service is ALWAYS excellent.  Never has my meal been anything other than what I ordered.  I have never had to wait an abnormal amount of time for my meal to arrive once I ordered.  Drinks are always promptly refilled.  Staff is always friendly and polite.    *Parking is hit or miss honestly.  If you go there during peak hours - Friday @8pm, parking can definitely be tight.  But usually, there is ample space is the lot directly behind the building.   *I love that they have Dos Equis Amber on draft all day, every day!  Lowlights: NONE  Great, upscale Mexican food and dining experience, but with reasonable prices.  Cantina leads all competition - La Paz, Vida Cantina (at the epicenter), and Zapatas, when it comes fabulous Mexican food in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I come here quite frequently on my lunch breaks from work.  I usually opt for the bar, instead of a table.  My go-to is the carne asada quesadillas.   The steak is always tasty and tender and it comes out fairly quickly.  It also comes served with a side/chopped salad.  The salad is better than what you might expect and I always gobble it up.  I also order the guac from time to time as well.  Of course its made at your table (or bar stool) and is served with warm, house made tortilla chips.  You simply can't go wrong with the Prima Guac @ Cantina!       I've had excellent service while sitting at the bar here for lunch.  I've had very lackluster service as well.  Either way, the staff at this establishment is always welcoming ,and friendly.  There's also plenty of parking in the busy Stonecrest Shopping Center.  If you live and breath in Charlotte, North Carolina, then I'm sure you've at least heard of Cantina before - if you haven't been down here to the Stonecrest location, give it a try, its got the same savory Tex-Mex flavor as the original location @ 1511 East Blvd!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location open at Park Road probably five or six times now. It's consistently good. I always get the cojita salad which is around 9.95 and it's always come with a choice of protein, chicken shrimp or fish. Today I was told that it comes with chicken but to add salmon or shrimp is an extra $15. That's crazy. I'd be paying $25 for lunch salad. No thanks. Got the salad without the protein but I won't be getting that again. If That's actually accurate just something they need to really think about. Way too much to be paying for lunch."}
{"text":"Overpriced and overrated. The steak was dry, the service was poor. Had to ask for a new server cause she didn't come by for 10 minutes to greet us. I watched 2 other couples get sat with chips and salsa while our table was empty. Manager comped some guacamole but that still doesn't make it okay. Drinks were expensive, rice was gross. The only part I liked which is the reason for the second star is their shrimp taco I had."}
{"text":"We've gotten take out from here a few times. We never dine in because we have two toddlers and it looks like the kind of place that is just not conducive to a good family experience. I can live with that though, the food is fantastic! The guacamole is fresh and delicious, and the salsa verde is perfectly tangy and not too spicy. The fajitas are great, especially with all the little extras to elevate them like the grilled green onions, and the fresh pickled veg and cotija cheese on the side. Yum!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Really great food!  1511 serves both authentic Mexican and Tex-Mex style food.  The Barbacoa de Puerco is amazing.  My fiance and I split the dinner size and it was more than enough.  We have also had the cuatro leches and enchilladas de Dennis...they are both wonderful as well.  The atmosphere is great and they offer every tequila you can imagine!  They have regular beer specials as well.  This place is a winner!!!"}
{"text":"Cantina 1511 has great service and amaaazing authentic Mexican food! And did I mention they make their guac fresh to order! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me here on our way through Charlotte during a recent vacation. Enjoyed it well enough although I can't say it was memorable. The atmosphere was very lively but it was a bit pricey. I'd go again though."}
{"text":"Last night a group of friends and I decided to head to Cantina to get our mexican fix.  I love the atmosphere of the place, you have the choice to sit inside or out...great music playing throughout...dim lighting, candles lit...I think this would make for a perfect first or second date night dinner :)  I had the chicken fajitas and they were wonderful - so much food that I couldn't finish it all!  The salsas were great, the guacamole was excellent, and the service was pretty good overall.  We all had a round or two of margaritas - they were ok, not mind blowing, and I thought they were rather weak (especially for 12 bucks a pop!).  If the drinks were better, I would've bumped this to a 5 star rating.  All of my friends that were with me seemed to really enjoy their food, for 3 of them it was the first time going - and they all said they would go back.    Overall, another great experience at Cantina, I'll just steer clear of the margaritas next time!"}
{"text":"This has become my favorite Mexican restaurant. I feel like they understand what Mexican food is from all the different parts of Mexico. It's not just Tex-Mex but it has mixes of Baja flavors as well.  The staff was awesome and it was an enjoyable evening!! Can't wait to go there once again.  UPDATE: 1/23/2010 - My Partner and I went there last night for our 10 year anniversary. The staff was just as warm and as engaging as ever. Well, we spent a lot of money at the bar, just the two of us, and then bought a nice bottle of wine. We had an awesome dinner and the staff went out of their way to make sure that we had the perfect table & evening of our lives. THIS IS THE BEST RESTAURANT IN CHARLOTTE, NC!! YOU MUST TRY THEM NOW AND TELL THEM Jake and Barrie sent ya!! Ask for Heather!"}
{"text":"3 stars for the food I received.   Negative stars for everything else. I don't understand how you charge over $9 for queso and don't even provide the queso.  Just chips. No salsa either, which I understand is complimentary and served with takeout at basically every Spanish/Mexican place.   So $19 for two carne Assad's tacos, rice and beans, and tortilla chips (which were warmer than the tacos or the rice/beans). No salsa, no $9+ queso I paid for.    Avoid the place unless it's a necessity, it just has high prices because of location. Not checking the food is 100% on the restaurant as well as the delivery driver, but i place most of the blame on the restaurant as they are the one selling the product."}
{"text":"Cantina has pretty fantastic Mexican food. I love their guacamole, and have never had a bad dish. My office had our Christmas/holiday luncheon two weeks ago. We were given a semiprivate room behind the bar & had a really great experience. I hate that I don't remember our server's name, but he was uber responsive and managed a crowd of 15 like a champ. He kept our drinks and chip baskets full and the food came out quickly + all of the orders were correct!   You honestly can't go wrong with Cantina... the only reason I haven't been back since is I'm on the paleo diet and can't resist the temptation of chips at Mexican. Once I'm off the diet wagon again, I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"5 of us went to the new location last night. The food was great as always, but the service was really bad.  We had reservations and they sat us right away when we got there. The waitress came in and asked for our drink order. We ordered A pitcher  of margaritas, waters and started with some guacamole. The waitress came back with four waters about five minutes later. One short of the five we asked for, no big deal... next another server came over and did our table side guac. She did a great job but unfortunately we didn't have any chips (or salsa). About five minutes after the guacamole was made our waitress came back with chips and the other water. We then asked about the pitcher of margaritas, and she said they were not ready yet. We then sat there for 15 more minutes and our waitress never came back. I finally got up and went to the bar and saw our pitcher and glasses sitting there. I asked the bartender if that was for my table and explained we been there for 25 minutes waiting for those and hadn't seen our waitress in 15 minutes. The bartender was great and immediately brought the margaritas to our table and apologized for our wait. The bad service continued after that though. Our water glasses were empty and we ran out of chips. We asked our waitress for a refill of waters and more chips and waited several minutes before we received them. She did not clear one plate from our table the entire time. It wasn't that busy so it was extra annoying how bad the service was. I had gone to the location on East Boulevard several times and have been to the Park Road location a lot as well and never had bad service.   I'm hoping this is just because it opened recently"}
{"text":"My biggest disappointment were the pre-made drinks that tasted like adult juice. Ordered two tacos, al pastor and another I can't remember, both were underwhelming. I've been here before and also not been thrilled. Although the staff is always very friendly. If you're shopping in the area or going to see a movie, it's not terrible, but not anything special."}
{"text":"Umm NO! It's like a Mexican Chilis. However the arepa appetizer was alright and that's about it."}
{"text":"Disappointed. I wanted to like this place. Not sure if my experience was mainly due to the waitress we had but the overall experience was bad.   The waitress was oblivious. She wasn't rude but wasn't attentive either. We had to ask a waiter passing by for drink refills, place settings, and chips and salsa. I have a feeling our waitress also lied to us about our order because 20min after we ordered, she came to our table and said \"some girl\" spilled water all over our food and that she had to resubmit our order. But then proceeded to ask for our order again.   When our food finally came out another 15mins later, the food was cold. Besides being cold, the food was also subpar. I ordered Baja fish tacos & carne asada taco which were very bland.   I would give it another shot if this first impression wasn't as bad as it was. :("}
{"text":"This place ! Excellent customer service followed with delicious food equals an exceptional experience!   The lunch was tacos and with beans and rice. Sounds basic c right ?  The tacos were so good. One Barbacoa and one chicken . Honestly ever single bite made me think , \"my god this is good ! \"  It's a definite place we will return to eat !   The menu had such a great variety there was honestly a bit of a dilemma trying to decide what to choose.  The wait staff were efficient and very friendly. The whole experience was delightful ! Like Arnold says, \"I'll be back ! \""}
{"text":"Always a GREAT mexican restaurant...the salsa is PERFECT!"}
{"text":"I can't sing enough praises for Cantina.....I know, I'm late in my  discovery....but hey it's way too many restaurants in the qc;-)  I must admit this was the first time trying guac and umm, I'll just say it has to grow on me.  The restaurant was very busy as it was during lunch on a Friday, however there was no wait time and the food was ordered and on the table in no time!  Grilled fish taco's and chicken milanese tacos were simply to die for! Full of wonderful seasoning and flavors and slaw, and pico and the rice and the beans.......and ahhhh, I just loved every minute of it.  I'm still dreaming of Cantina.........."}
{"text":"This place is pretty darn good. The bar menu is a steal if you come during happy hour. Lunch has amazing deals. The salsa is amazing. Good place to come after-work, or have an office social.  I made the mistake of coming here on Cinco de Mayo... Avoid at all costs.  Dinner can be a little pricey, but all in all, Charlotte is lucky to have this place."}
{"text":"Hit and miss! Been a few times now because my friends rave about this place but each time we've left a little disappointed. Good guacamole and margaritas but entrees not great, authentic mexican menu is good but the quality has been hit and miss every time, burnt taco's, too much american cheese, long waits etc.  We will try it again but with lower expectations on the way in."}
{"text":"This review will be short - because my visit was super short as well.  The boy and I showed up late Sunday afternoon for an early dinner/late lunch/super late breakfast and were quickly seated in the bar area.  The lighting was very dim - good if you want a romantic date, bad if you want to read the menu.    Anyways, we had a Living Social voucher to redeem so we ordered tons of food - starting with the table side guac.  The server brought us chips and salsa and was just about to show up with the guac when the power went out - twice.  Apparently the power went out and then their backup generator failed.    Turns out the power wasn't expected to be back on for a few hours so we enjoyed our guac by candlelight and were also serenaded by the waiter....  Our real meal never happened - obviously - no power, but I liked the way that they handled the unexpected situation and darn, now I have to go back!"}
{"text":"Ancho chicken tacos are where its at! Table side guac is always good. We gave them make it without salt though, the chips are salty enough for it all!"}
{"text":"It wasn't a good dining experience.  Food was cold, they didn't check on us, then when I sent the food back both servers scolded me for not dealing with it quicker. Sadly both servers (trainer and trainee) didn't check back with us for over 20 minutes (side work).  They fixed it, after both schooling me, then got us out of there as quickly as possible.  I wanted dessert, wasn't offered. Check came.  Poor showing.  I'll skip this place next time I want Mexican."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try the lump crab and avocado quesadillas, as a friend of mine raved about his order at the uptown location. Although I live much closer to the uptown location, we thought this one would be more convenient in terms of parking. As soon as I walked in the door, I had to make the group of three hostesses speak, but the lady behind the counter was much more welcoming. Waitress was friendly enough, but I must say that NO ONE seemed to be genuinely welcoming nor appreciative of our patronage.  To top it off, the quesadillas were NOT good. Of course, could be a preference thing, but the jalapeño bacon tasted more like ham-rubbery and overcooked. Chips and guac were literally the only things worth it. My fiance said that his calamari and low country tacos were mediocre at best. The piña margarita also tasted like a glass of lemon juice.  As we walked out, no one thanked us or even acknowldged us. Maybe the uptown location is just better? Just seemed like the people have created their own little world at this Park Rd. location, and do not take kindly to \"outsiders\" coming into it. Really quite disgusting when you consider their attitudes. Would NEVER return. Will continue to visit 1900 at Elizabeth or make the trek to Chuy's."}
{"text":"I've been here twice before and I've gotta say the salsa and chips are THEE BEST!!! It may not be the normal hole in the wall good Mexican joint but this place can run with the best of them. I got the half sized nachos with beef... And I thought they were the full size. Pretty cheap.   If you order the nachos, leave the onions and green peppers off. I think this contributed to the weird flavor; but all in all it was really good.   Service was good. I left my usual 20%."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Cantina 1511.. However, one thing about me is that I kept ordering the same darn thing when I go there or many other places at that. I'm In love with the mojitos. I have tried every types they offer. Having their mojitos on my birthday was the perfect way to keep my mid life crisis at bay.  I alway ordered the fish tacos every time. Nothing to complain about. I did recently visited them and order their \"street\" food platter. Which includes battered calamari, meatball with cheese, nacho salad, some other type of food I can't remember. This is the perfect way for me to step outside my box. I'm always a big fan of tapas. And it's exactly that. Everything on that platter is delicious. I would order it again. Customer services is alway great, the way I remember it. But most of the time, I'm tipsy from their mojitos by the time I leave. Haha. Either way, I have visited them many times before and will continue to do so as long as they don't change too much."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and it simply boils down to this: Service was terrible. Requested a refill on tea and had to give my tea away after waiting for 15 mins. Chimichangas were seriously lacking the chicken that was advertised. The cilantro was overwhelming. There were peas and corn in it. Now, I'm not sure if that was in the rice but it wasn't disclosed and people do have allergies. Overall, I was terribly disappointed in the food, the service and the overall experience."}
{"text":"This is a nice Mexican restaurant. The atmosphere is very peaceful and just very relaxing. Service here is wonderful and everyone is very welcoming and polite.  I ordered a \"tanga chicken burrito\" and replaced my sides with rice and everything came out beautifully. The burrito was exquisite and detail was very much paid attention to while making it.   The queso was  to die for so I highly recommend to everyone who goes there to get the \"five cheese Queso fundido\" as an appetizer. You won't regret it!   This is one of the best Mexican restaurant I have ever been to."}
{"text":"Since moving from East Blvd., we haven't visited until today for lunch.  Very pleased with the service, decor, and lunch menu.  I ordered their appetizer platter, and my wife ordered the mushroom quesidillas.  Both were excellent and piping hot.  Chips and salsa aplenty.  My only tick to 4 v. 5 stars was the taste of each offering seemed close in flavor to the other offerings we ordered.  All the food was very good and pleasantly presented.  Each piece just needed a nudge to differentiate itself from others on the plate.  That said, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Cantina always satisfies my Mexian cravings every time. I always enjoy sitting outside on the patio and indulging on a mojito and over indulging on chips and salsa. I know several people were not happy with the changes in management but I have not noticed anything that would keep me from coming back. They have all the basics and they fix them perfectly ever time I've been."}
{"text":"Stopped by the New Park Road 1511 yesterday and started off with chips that had no salt and were void of any taste at all.  The quesadillas were the same.  I. Asked the waiter several questions about the meal and it was apparent he knew nothing and did not care. Did you leave your cooks and wait staff at the old location.   This was really bad food and service."}
{"text":"Best. Service. Ever. The waitress had our chips and salsa refilled before we asked for more, and everything was fast. The food came out quickly and was awesome. We also had the queso fundito, it is so neat! They have $4 mimosas and bloody Mary's on Sunday, along with a brunch menu."}
{"text":"Lunch ground beef burrito...perfect size for a quick bite...I am a good full and service was good...not around too much and easy to call over when we needed her. Shakeshack opened today and that might be why it was so nooooot busy haha either way great experience"}
{"text":"Nice decor and good sounds for a lunch date. I didn't have to scream over the lunch buzz. Terrific service, nuf said. Food is limited menu that accents tacos of all types and creativity. Tacos dishes well presented but lacking in flavor. Not bad but doesn't live up to what it looks like. Salsa and chips where good and they do an adult beverage special each day of the work week. You can't hate a $5.00 hand made mojito on a Monday. Have OMB on tap and was able to quaff a Mecktober seasonal that was quite tasty with the salsa and chips."}
{"text":"Very good margaritas and my tacos were delicious. We very much enjoyed our visit! Also, they were pet friendly which was great for eating on the outside patio with our puppy."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is from San Francisco and I am from Atlanta, but we have lived in Charlotte for about a year now. Unfortunately, we have yet to find Mexican food here that satisfies our high standard cravings. We ventured to Cantina 1511 last weekend to give it a try. It was definitely good, but not nearly as divine as the delicious authentic Mexican restaurant in my hometown or the amazing California burritos that my boyfriend is accustomed to from back home. We ordered a pitcher of the house margaritas after wavering over whether or not to make the investment. Unfortunately, our $28 pitcher of margaritas almost entirely consisted of super-sour mix rather than much tequila. We decided to try the guacamole, made table side by our waiter. He asked how much spice did we want, to which I said, \"a little bit.\" Apparently, I should have asked him to make it as spicy as possible - it barely had any kick to it and was less flavorful than Harris Teeter's guacamole (and definitely no Chipotle, either). It was Saturday evening, but our waiter seemed very busy. He slowly refilled our chips and drinks. Yes, I understand that it was peak busy hours, so I can cut him some slack for that. I ordered the entree salad topped with chicken. It was quite delicious! Flavorful, tender chicken, fresh veggies, and a nice mix of cheese and spicy-ish ranch dressing. It was also enormous - definitely get bang for your buck there. I couldn't finish it. My boyfriend had the Mexican Barbequed Pork plate, which was essentially carnitas. It came with only three flour tortillas, but a nice convo of rice, beans, guacamole, and pico de gallo. He enjoyed it, but it was nothing memorable. All in all, Cantina 1511 is certainly decent, but basically only on par with my expectations for a Mexican restaurant in North Carolina."}
{"text":"Tried Cantina for the first time on Thursday as I received a voucher for Christmas. We sat at a hightop in the bar area and the service was great. Our server/bartender was very knowledgeable and friendly. He made some great recommendations for both food and drink, especially the appetizer of corn cakes with Mexican style pulled pork which were amazing. The menu had the usual fare with a few more unique items and everything we had was delicious."}
{"text":"Good but not great.  I like the tacos, specifically the pastor and asada on white corn.  And the queso and guac are great.  I can't find anything else on the menu that is particularly good after so many visits.  I've tried the new things they have added but they just taste cheesy, not authentic.  I know they can do better..."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!  Jason, our server, was very attentive, friendly, and professional.  We loved the fresh tortilla chips and tasty salsa.  We ordered the delicious guacamole that Jason made fresh at our table.  Everything was great including the chicken burrito and carne asada bowls we devoured!   Fun & festive atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This place is exactly what uptown needed!! The ambiance is chill but elegant and the food is awesome! Finally some authentic mexican food that's actually tastes fresh. Service is friendly and professional. Great place for sure and definitely worth trying out"}
{"text":"I've been patiently waiting to visit Cantina 1511 as it prepared to move to Park Road Shopping Center.  'I'll wait till they move to revisit (had great experiences many times in the past).\"  \"When they move to Park Road, parking will be better, I'll wait\". \"Ok, they've moved and re-opened, but no liquor license, doesn't work for 'Girls Night', I'll wait\".  A month later, stop by for dinner on a Saturday night, 6:30, one hour wait, \"Good for them, doesn't work for me tonight, movie plans, \"I'll wait\"  Went today for lunch just before noon, no wait, Awesome.  Very attentive service, very nice wait staff, had all of our drinks refilled 4 times, mainly because it took nearly an hour for our food to arrive.  No special orders, basic burritos, torta.  Sorry, there was ONE special order: Big Burrito but without meat, no problem!  Food was decent for the most part, but the fries were cold and wimpy, and none of us had ever seen green peas in a  burrito before, or celery, but who were we to judge?!  So, overall, Meh experience so far.  Got the check, paid, wrapping up conversation when a MOUSE runs out from next to my chair and I watch it run clear across the restaurant floor underneath people's tables past their feet.    I am not an alarmist and don't generally draw attention to the negatives.  On my way out, I asked very discreetly, to speak to a manager, thinking he should know.  He was totally unfazed. Told me there had been other 'sightings' of mice, just hadn't been able to see where they were coming from, told me they would 'probably' call their exterminator to set traps. I told him exactly where 'my' mouse came from and he said 'ok, sorry about that. How was everything else?'    Poor response.  Maybe he shouldn't have told me that there were other sightings, but he offered that info and it was disturbing that no action had already been taken.  Not really wanting to eat where mice are running around and doing their thing.  Again, wait staff was very good, kitchen could have been quicker, great guacamole, but the mouse did me in (not to mention the lack of concern by the management).  Sorry to say Goodbye Cantina, it was good while it lasted."}
{"text":"Received great service!  The server was Chelsea. She was prompt and friendly. Excellent food. Be prepared to ask for a doggie bag!  Large portions!  Margaritas are very good as well. Will go back!"}
{"text":"When I first moved to Charlotte, my husband and I went to Cantina during its off-peak hours. When we went in and got seated we noticed it had an unusual and unpleasant odor. After sitting for just a couple minutes we decided to leave. A few months have gone past and after multiple people told us they like Cantina 1511, we thought we'd give it another chance.  We went for dinner and it was a popular place! I could still smell a slight odor (like a mildew rag), but it seemed to be overpowered by the smells of sautéed onions and grilled meats. Perhaps I was more sensitive to it because of our prior experience. I'm sure the majority of their patrons do not notice.   The service was great! Their staff was very friendly. The food was pretty good. I love chips and salsa and I was happy with theirs; they bring out red and green salsa. I think I'm a tough critic when it comes to Mexican or Tex Mex because I lived in Arizona and Texas the majority of my life...the Southwest is difficult to beat when it comes to Mexican food. Overall, the food was good and the service was great."}
{"text":"Ordered two top shelf tacos, as seen in the receipt. What was delivered were two regular tacos, one was beef which I can't even eat. Tried to call and after 12 attempts the line was either busy, call failed, or was disconnected? This was the whole reason we had to order online in the first place. Not only was I delivered the wrong food after paying for the more expensive tacos however I was delivered a meat I can't eat. Now I can't get in touch with the restaurant to get refunded. DO NOT RECOMMEND DELIVERY THROUGH DOOR DASH!!!"}
{"text":"Birthday dinner with a party of 10 meant that we got to sit right in the middle of the restaurant, since we were too many for the octagon fish bowl room that's right by the hostess stand.   Some of our party was straggling, so we sat and ordered our drinks.  I'd been warned that the margaritas were pricey, so I opted for the orange-raspberry sangria, since I was only drinking with dinner and then being the DD for the bar crawl afterwards.  What a disappointment.  Not only did it not taste like orange or raspberry (more like mango?) but it also didn't take anything like wine or anything alcoholic for that matter, and not in a \"wow that goes down so easy because I can't taste the alcohol\" kind of way.   I tried my friend's red sangria, and it was worse - it tasted off, not just bad, but as if the wine in it had gone bad.  Once the stragglers arrived, pitchers of margaritas were ordered, and I got to try one - all sour mix.  Did that thing even have tequila in it?  Seriously, for those prices, I would expect a buzz, and I did not get it.    Fortunately the tableside guacamole was delicious.  Not sure why they can charge more at these places for you to see them make it in front of you - except that does prove that they're starting with fresh avocados, which I imagine is the main source of the expense.  They got it right - good balance of salt, jalapenos, tomatoes, and onions.  Not as good as mine, but best I've had in a restaurant in a long time.  The cheese dip was not as good  - too chunky for my taste, as if all the cheese hadn't melted thoroughly enough or properly (like when you try to melt low fat cheese).  The salsas had great flavor, as did the chips, which were already salted (good for me, but bad for your blood pressure).  Trying to be good, I opted for the veggie enchiladas.  Though not what I expected based on the description, they were good, and I don't even like corn, which is mostly what they tasted like to me.  There was zucchini was diced to be about the size of the corn, so really all I tasted was the corn and the sauces on top.   Both the green and the red were delicious.  The rice was blah, but the beans were quite nice.    The server did an excellent job of separating out our checks, and didn't even include the usual automatic 18% gratuity, but you could tell that we weren't her favorite table.  She kept coming back every few minutes at the beginning asking if we were ready to order when our full party hadn't arrived, even when we told her that we'd wait for them.  And the other staff was aggressively removing stuff from the table, as soon as you put your fork down or you started getting air from the bottom of your beverage.  Also, in the process of clearing the chips and salsa, the server spilled almost an entire dish on John's sleeve, and didn't even flinch!  The whole thing made the dinner feel frantic, not enjoyable.  All in all, I would say go if you're craving some good guacamole and a Mexican beer, but eat before or after at somewhere where you get more value."}
{"text":"My dining experience at Cantina/Stonecrest last week was above average, rating a 4 out of 5. While it was a Monday night, the restaurant was packed. I ordered a margarita at the bar while waiting for my friends and my table. Once we got seated, we joked about how no one wanted to wait on us because we looked like we were having too much fun. Finally, we got our chips and salsa (fresh!) and placed our orders.   I am totally addicted to nachos. The messier the better! And, it's great value at Cantina if you're watching your pennies, which I am!   The nachos that I ordered was a huge portion. Enough for two people easily. Fresh guacamole and sour cream was not spared in the least. I had to order jalapenos (forgot when I originally placed my order), but they were brought out quickly. Freshly sliced and spicy!   I order Tres Leches cake off the menu. It was dry with a whipped topping that I expected to be homemade and fresh, but seemed to come straight from a can.   Cantina is definitely one of my \"go to\" places. I loved how they can make a mean Jalapeno margarita if you ask them and if you're going out for Restaurant Week, make sure Cantina is on your list. Of all the places I've visited over the last few years during Restaurant Week, Cantina gives you the best for the value!"}
{"text":"We started with the queso which was awesome ( but then again when isnt cheese not awesome).  The food was a solid, it wasn't quite super authentic, but they had a little twist on it which I enjoyed.  It definitely feels like you are eating at a restaurant and so home made or fast food type place. I would probably return if a friend wanted Mexican and we were in the area.  I like how they make the gauc in front of you and endless chips are always good.  The only thing I didn't like was the decor was a little bit dreary and I agree with Faith about the mildew rag smell.  All in all, it was better than average"}
{"text":"Quacamole not your favorite?  IT WILL  BE HERE!!!!  I enjoy excellent \"real mexican food in the southwest\" This place comes very close on their \"authentic mexican food items\". They might even be a little more tasty. Pork Carnitas with Habernero and Guac sauce. UNREAL! Not too spicy promise! Order it! Hands down one of the best pulled pork carnitas I have EVER had!  Excellent Food, Excellent service! Well Done and Yum!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites!  Margaritas, guacamole, fun atmosphere, and of course the quatros leches cake...can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This is my Charlotte standby.  Takeout or eat in - marco polo tacos is generally my order of choice.  I could eat this every night no problem.  Love it!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Charlotte. I take out of town family and friends here, and everyone always has a good time. I like that they make the guac fresh at the table. The drinks are awesome. They have good happy hour deals on food. Sitting at the bar area is actually pleasant. Great patio for a nice day, fun to wear sunglasses, people watch, and watch the cars drive by and all the South Charlotte runners. Ambiance is not cheesy at all, hostesses and servers are friendly, etc. There is a weird fishbowl room for large groups that I would avoid if you come in a large group. But definitely make a reservation, you will need it-- this place gets packed! If you come on a Sunday after church the crowd is full of Uptown/Dilworth \"society\" families schmoozing. But that does not detract at all from how great Cantina is!"}
{"text":"I've been to Cantina 1511 about 5 few times now and I have to say I have mixed feelings about it.  The food is wonderful. It's creative and classic and delicious. The salsa is some of the best I've had in Charlotte and being from Southern AZ this is a big deal.  My mixed feelings come from the service. I have yet to have good service at Cantina 1511. The waitstaff seems confused by the menu, today my server asked ME questions about the menu. When I am there I feel like I am always waiting for something.   It is a shame because the food is really good and I love the atmosphere but if I am going to be paying $15 bucks for tacos I expect the service to be worth it."}
{"text":"So I finally decided I have to say something.    Three separate stories - sorry if it's long!   A few months ago - my friend and I were at cantina and ordered queso (with no onions) they put in the queso these weird long skinny onions in their queso - it came with onions... Boooo we then ordered a pitcher of margaritas - the waiter recommended we upgrade our tequila, making it a $40 pitcher- ok no problem lets do it!  First pitcher - tasted ok and we finished it with ease... So we decided to get a second pitcher - it came and we finished 3/4 of it... And we didn't even have a buzz... My friend made the comment \"these taste like only mix!\" I agreed we didn't even feel anything after each having a pitcher basically... So we asked for the manager and told him these pitchers didn't have any tequila in them! He said \"what!? Ok...\" And took it to the back... He offered us shots instead!? Shots!? I'm eating dinner at 8pm not at the club.... Awkward... We were like uhhhh no. He came back to the table and said he went in the back and tasted it and said it tasted like only mix! Well duh that's what we told you!!! He took one pitcher off the bill for us.... We walked out sober. And with onion breath. Bleh.   Last month - my friend and I sat at the bar and ordered a margarita just a glass this time. We finished one and ordered another - SHE made the same comment \"is there tequila in this thing!?\" I hadn't ever told her my past experience... We were through 2 margaritas at this point and she said something to the bartender who gave us the worst attitude and said \"well do you want a double then?!\" She said \"no I just want a margarita that tastes like it has tequila in it!\"   Last night - a couple of friends came over and the first thing they said when they walked in \"well we tried to catch a buzz at cantina but the pitcher didn't have any tequila in it!!!!\" Omg right!?! I told them what had happened to me!!! Not surprised!!!!   3 times/stories no liquor in the drinks!!!! Good atmosphere but plan on walking out sober!"}
{"text":"Chef Greg's Avacado Bake and half price Mimosa's and Sangria for Sunday brunch. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I love Cantina. I'm not getting the whole menu change thing, as I've been going to this place since 2009 and I don't notice a HUGE difference. ALSO, and honestly, if you want real Mexican food- go to a restaurant where you see other Mexicans sitting and eating. This is, what I consider, a white people Mexican place. Not to offend. If I want a step, or a few steps, above my normal Mexican spots I like to dine (like Marias, Azteca, etc) at Cantina.  Love the food- I usually get the Burritos and they are LARGE. I always have enough to take home the next day. The beans always taste fresh and the chips and salsa before the meal are excellent. We've had the guac. a few times and it's great, but it's not a staple everytime we dine b/c it is a tad expensive.  The Margheritas, though pricey, are also EXCELLENT! If you're in Charlotte and want an upscale Mexican/Tex Mex place- this is the spot to go. In fact, I'm going this weekend....Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Went here on Cinco de mayo and there was over an hour wait. We waited and it was actually closer to an hour and a half. They had live music and salsa dancing. It was very loud inside kinda reminded me of a club on a Saturday night. There were shot girls trying to sell shots and lots of dancing. Felt like I had to yell to order and also have a conversation with someone sitting two feet away from me. We ordered the table side guacamole which was amazing, highly recommend it. I also ordered some kind of enchilada which was the best thing I have ever had!! I've never had Mexican food with so much flavor! Most Mexican food is bland and dry and this was not the case with this place! Would definitely return but probably not on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Holy \"Made fresh at your table\" Guacamole!!!  My heart skips a beat just thinking about it.  Tex-Mex fine dining... at it's finest. Also an important note:  One of my top five places to drink a house margarita."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of Cantina 1511.  I lived right down the street from the Stonecrest location for years and whenever I went, I was underwhelmed with the food for what it costs.  But my girlfriend had a gift certificate (YAY) and we were going to see a movie at Park Terrace next door (YAY), so onward.   Arriving at 12:30 over the Christmas holiday, the hostesses were very friendly and I was seated immediately.  Soon after my ears started to bleed (not really, I am being a drama queen) because it is nerve-deafeningly loud in there.  To their credit, it was a full house during peak lunchtime, but good dog.  We had to scream across the table to be heard.  The waiter was efficient, especially considering how busy they were.   He kept the glasses of two very thirsty girls filled.  Though I love queso, I refuse to pay $10 for it, so we went cheese-less.  The complimentary chips and salsa were fresh and good. My order of a beef chimichanga ($13.75) was fine.  *shrug  For $14 you get a very large chimichanga with a pile of lettuce/pico.  There may have been 8 small pieces of steak in it.  Meh.  Good wait staff.  And for me, passable food but nothing that I crave or would look forward to."}
{"text":"Another place that is a local favorite that I am just not down with.  I will repeat what other reviewers have stated - overpriced.  Meaning, the exorbitant prices are not justified by the quality of the product or the experience.  I am perfectly content with Azteca, Monterrey, etc. - fair prices for a mixture of beans, rice and meat in some form of a tortilla.    On a Sunday at 11:30, there was a sparse crowd.  We were seated immediately by a guy who was rubber-banding crayons for kids (don't get me started - I am going to start eating at titty bars to avoid breeders and their ill-mannered spawn).  Our server was friendly enough, minimal chatting and kept the fresh drinks coming, so points for that.    The food: A small bowl of super-salty tortilla chips, from what I imagine was the bottom of the bag.  Mostly broken pieces, but the waitress did bring a new batch with mostly whole chips once she saw the basket of chip shards/dust.  Served with salsa, which I didn't eat any of to save room for the queso Queso - $9.50.  That's right - that's a 9.  Almost $10 for a crock of barely melted cheese and a few onions thrown in for texture.  You would think it would taste like cotton candy, sex and hundred dollar bills for $10.  Nope.  Cheese.  Just cheese.  And a couple of onion slices.  Served with warm flour tortillas to go along with our over-salted chips.  It's cheese, so I ate it, but it wasn't in my top 10 queso list.  Putting it in a small, fancy crock with a tea candle under it doesn't justify the 1000% markup.  Fail.   Carne Asada Steak Burrito - $12.75.  The burrito was HUGE, like took up half of the plate huge.  And while I am a big believer in the theory that size matters, this was a lot of burrito.  I noticed that it was served with slaw, lettuce, tomato, sour cream and guacamole on the side, and being used to the aforementioned mexican joints, I wondered where the rice and/or beans were?  They are stuffed in the giant burrito, along with corn, peas and carrots (?) and the steak (which was fine, nothing special).  It was good.  I ate about 1/3 at the restaurant and ate the rest for dinner.  It reheated well and was okay.  I had not been to Cantina for many years, the last time I went they cilantro'ed the shit out of everything after I had asked for no cilantro.  After yesterday's visit, it will be many more years before I return."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful service. The manager was great too. Often a manager will see that waters need to be refilled and tell the server to do it. This manager asked if we needed refills, went and got a pitcher, and refilled our waters himself. That says a lot about the manager and the way the restaurant is run. I was very impressed. They really have a team effort going on here. I got the ancho shrimp salad which was SO GOOD. I would go back just for that salad. My husband got the enchiladas and was a bit disappointed that they weren't cheesier. He said they were just OK. My salad was a good, fair price at $10.75 but we thought the other menu items were a bit overpriced. $10 for guac or queso is steep. I also think $15 for 3 tacos is steep. I'm sure their rent costs a lot but my husband said the Mexican food down the road at the other Cantina is cheaper and better. I'd go back for the salad though!"}
{"text":"Great wait staff. Had the quesadillas with chicken and it was delicious! Also had the house sangria which was sweeter than most sangrias I've had, but still very good. The chips they give you to snack on are good, but the salsa is very spicy (at least for someone who prefers mild/medium salsa). Sister had tortilla soup and she had stated it was too spicy as well (and she usually likes spicy food)."}
{"text":"We went to Cantina on a busy Saturday night. It was loud like others have commented but that didn't bother me too much. The service was about a C- and the food a D. The server was friendly enough but didn't get refills, she didn't clear dirty plates either. It was a larger group so maybe that had something to do with it. I had tacos and they were really bland. Half the table thought the food was just ok, and the other half just not good."}
{"text":"Greeting and food service was on the slow side to be 3PM and pretty empty. We were standing upfront for about 15 minutes and literally no one stopped to check our status or seat us. Once seated, our server Luke was definitely helpful and on point with his drink and taco suggestions though.   We had the street corn as an appetizer, total waste of $4. Corn on the cob (probably the smallest I've ever seen), lathered in oil and a sprinkle of cheese. I was expecting at least a juicy piece of corn and all the things that would make it almost worth spending $4 for & even more so \"Mexican Street Corn\". I had the shrimp and Al Pastor tacos with saffron rice and opted for sweet plantains instead of beans ($2 upcharge). Tacos were pretty tasty (that's what the one star is for), plantains were burnt on some ends and they were all stuck together. Saffron rice would've been good had I not chomped on a few hard clusters of rice.   I went back on yelp and saw the South Park location had better reviews - because I really wanted to like this place,  I'm willing to give Cantina 1511 another shot but at the South Park location. One star for the tacos alone."}
{"text":"Oh how I wish I could have given this very popular place more stars. I don't know, maybe because I grew up in a Mexican neighborhood in Chicago, or that I lived on the West Coast for years, but I have a certain expectation for Mexican food that I have really yet to find here in Charlotte (except at a couple of dive joints down South Blvd). Anyway, I know the whole story about the South African owner, and JWU trained Chefs, blah blah blah. But here's the story....the food just isn't that spectacular. It isn't. The guacamole was good, but had TOO much line and not enough salt to bring out the flavors. It could have used more red onion as well. The chips were good, but lacked salt and didn't seem that fresh to me. The Orange and Spice Crusted Pork Tenderloin was average, and the pork was well done, not a pink center which I asked for. The \"crust\" part was tough to chew, and I just couldn't finish the dish because of it.   I got their \"spicy\" Margarita and while good, I didn't get the whole \"spicy\" flavor that our lovely Community Manager Nikki raved about. I'm thinking, WHERE'S THE HEAT? It did say SPICY didn't it??? Ugggg  The highlight of the evening was them giving us the Queso and tortilla as a complimentary extra. Now THAT was really good....honestly the only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of 2.  The restaurant is really loud, and very busy. Which is a good sign. But I'm convinced that the good folks of Charlotte just haven't had a really GREAT, AUTHENTIC Mexican restaurant yet. When you do, you'll see just how different and BETTER it is than all these Tex/Cali Mex places that exist in Charlotte.  Look, this is a decent place for sure. Will I come back? Probably, and just get a darn Burrito, Chimi, Quesaidilla or Fajita. Maybe they do those the best?"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed this morning with the hospitality from Cantina.  My husband and I came for brunch and everything was going pretty well, his appetizer came, we got out drinks.  And we noticed that our entrees were taking a long time (45 minutes).  Everyone around us had gotten their meals and ours were super simple (a bowl of soup and a quesadilla). So I politely asked if our waiter would check for us.  He came back a few minutes later saying we were one of the next 1-2 tickets.  10 minutes later he brings out a burrito to my husband - who ordered a quesadilla).  So we sent that back.  5 minutes later he brings out my soup covered in cheese (I asked for no cheese), so I sent that back.  Etc, etc.    One would think that now would be an excellent time to offer some sort of discount if not the entire ticket comped due to the repetitive mistakes and excessive wait times.  Nope.  Full price, no apologies.  Overall the food is really good here but experience was pretty poor.  Hope they make some improvements to customer experience."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed Cantina 1511. We went a few time while we lived in Charlotte. Pretty good guacamole- made tableside. Decent margaritas. Best thing on the menu is the crab/avacado quesadilla with the mexican chopped salad as a side. Love love love the chopped salad. Pretty good menu with a huge variety. Definitely recommended for anyone looking for decent tex-mex food. We had a really nice experience every time we've gone."}
{"text":"I have never been a fan of Cantina and I finally discovered why I love their menu but don't like their food.    Do I sound a bit odd?  Let me explain.  Cantina claims that they serve authentic Mexican food and they do not.  They offer authentic categories of Mexican food, but having lived and traveled extensively in Mexico this is not it.  Someone mentioned \"pretentious\" and that is part of my issue. A lot of flash, garnishment and slick service, but the product is not authentic at all.  Their menu is fantastic.  Such variety of common Mexican foods.  Their taco menu is the best and that is where I go when I end up here.  The tacos are in two categories: their recommended versions, different takes on toppings.  And the mix and match option whereby you can order which ones you like at at discounted price.  BUT...even some of the tacos are \"jazzed-up\" into unusual concoctions.  Some are odd to me.  And so are the other categories, like enchiladas, quesadillas, burritos.  I keep trying other things in the hope that it will be SOMETHING I like, but fail every time.    My discovery is that, the meal items, they all are \"sweet\".  Caramelized onions dominate many of the dishes and even those are sweet like they were cooked with balsamic vinegar. The pickled onions they liberally put into dishes really clashes with the food itself.  On the other hand, most of the food is bland, take the salsa and beans.  Just not to my taste, but the rating is because my odd taste preferences clash with those of my son's family, which includes three grandchildren and many others that just love 1511.  And they do have a following, but I am not one of the followers.  There are many far more authentic Mexican places that are not fancy or pretentious.  If you are looking really good Mexican, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We are frequent visitors of the other 2 locations but have now dined at the uptown location twice.  Great service, even better food.  Tacos are my favorite food and these are considerably better that Babalu or Rurus.  (Much larger, actually have flavor & lower price here)  Atmosphere is the best and the decor is amazing...so much to see, so be sure to look around.  Love how they feature local artists work.  No where else I would get mexican in uptown!"}
{"text":"Although we have been to this location of Cantina many, many times, this is my first actual review.  Always great food, the tacos are larger and more flavorful than many spots... Service has improved over time.  We prefer to sit on the \"bar\" side as we like the atmosphere and seeing the tvs.  Tuesdays is \"kids night\" which is amazing...Kids eat FREE!   Cantina is our ONLY choice for Mexican.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First let me start out by saying, I'll never pay 10.99 for a hamburger again.  That or more ID exactly what you'll pay at Red Robin. While you get enough to eat, prices do not justify quality of a hamburger. I'll stick with fudruckers or Rushes. Their chili cheeseburgers stomps Red Robin's all over the city. I do like paying at table. We were not able to eat fries for eating hamburgers. Need atmosphere? Great date night restraint. But family place? Tad high"}
{"text":"Mmmm, I love this place, it doesn't get any better for Mexican food than this. I haven't been in a couple months but use to frequent this place for lunch when I went to school in the area. I would usually get their small Mexican chopped salad and it was huge, more than enough for one person. It also had a good variety of veggies on it, chick peas, jicama, avocado, peppers, onion and tomatoes. I'd usually add shrimp or chicken to it for my protein as well. I've also had their tacos with shrimp which are very tasty. They bring fresh chips and salsa to your table when you arrive and if you order the guacamole they'll prepare it tableside for you. Also be sure to try one of their Mojitos.;-)"}
{"text":"First time in, I went for lunch. Believe or not, I never got to eat my lunch.  The salsa and appetizer  filled me up so much I couldn't eat my tacos.  TO GO BOX PLEASE!   Here's what I know.  The salsa has a char taste to it. Makes it very different.   The pico has a good amount of garlic.  And the sampler platter is crazy good.   All in all.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Cantina is always my go to for girls night out or for b'day celebrations.  It's great for crowds,  the food is pretty much always good and so is the service.  It's a bit on the pricier side for Mexican/ Tex-Mex but I think the atomosphere makes it worth the extra money.  Plus, you can split all their meals.  It is a two dollar split charge-  but they give each person a full serving of the sides-- so it really evens it out-  its a TON of food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican places around town - you get a ton of food for the price, and they make the best margaritas I've ever had! Definitely a great place to go on date night or an evening out with friends. Great atmosphere, awesome friendly staff, definitely worth the coin."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here and i continue to be happy with the food and service. My husband had tacos that he can't stop raving about and our great waitress, Kris, steered me towards the mushroom and spinach quesadilla (I'm a pescatarian) and i had to stop myself from licking the plate. And i love the fact that their chips have a hint of salt on them...perfect for the salsa. Needless to say, we will be back."}
{"text":"I am from California so it has been a challenge for me to find the best mexican food in Charlotte. When I came to Cantina 1511, I have to say I found something that matched up pretty closely.   I have been here twice and both times the staff have been so helpful, they are always there to offer suggestions and every time they have been correct.   I have gotten the margarita sampler and that was really good. The blood orange one was delicious.   The guacamole is really fresh and tasty. I like my guacamole spicy and it wasn't really spicy but I am sure if you ask they will adjust it for you.   They give you a salsa that is mildly spicy but they have a spicy one so if you like spicy food ask for the spicy one. You will not be disappointed.   The food was delicious too, the first time I got cheese enchilada and I thought it was too cheesy (like way to cheesy) but the second time I got a veggie enchilada and it was much better.   Overall, a great place to have great mexican food in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Catina...but was disappointed.  We went on a Friday night and waited only 20 minutes for 2 people which wasn't too bad. The girl who sat us walk so much faster than us to the table and didn't even say anything before walking away. Our waiter was very friendly on the other hand. He brought out chips but they were out of containers for the salsa so we had to wait about 10minutes for salsa and I will say it was well worth the wait! The salsa is delicious! We ordered the house margaritas that was also really good and fairly strong! So the reason for the 2 stars, the delicious salsa and margaritas. Now for the food.....I ordered the enchilada suiza. Very disappointing. The chicken was so dry and tough! I barely ate my meal. I was wishing for more sauce to help with the dryness but they were lacking in sauce as well....such a bummer!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here plenty of times, but being a creature of habit I usually order my favorites which are the fresh guac made at your table and fish tacos. Last night I decided to be adventurous and asked the server what he recommended, Camarones Mojo y Ajo. Seriously? It was outstanding! Jumbo shrimp, toasted garlic, asparagus, pico de gallo, fresh lime, and veggie rice. Absolutely delish with my red sangria! Definitely my favorite spot in Charlotte for Mex-eating happiness."}
{"text":"Still haven't found that go to mexican restaurant in Charlotte. Don't quite understand the good reviews. Pre shredded cheese with powder coat is nasty. Fajitas with more peppers and onions than meat. And waiters with personalities of an unsalted cracker just don't cut it for me. What I would do for a Javier's of Orange County CA in Charlotte.  Only thing this place has going for it is the darling decor. That is not enough to ever bring us back."}
{"text":"+'s Gratis chips & salsa - ask them for their habanero salsa if you are a spicy food fan! Marco Polo Taco - shrimp + bacon... Yum! Pork Shank Appetizer - perfectly cooked, lightly sweet, soooo good!  Service - always great  -'s Prices - I think the prices are high but at least the food is consistently good"}
{"text":"We celebrated my sister's birthday at Cantina 1511 this past fall and it was delicious from beginning to end. We started off with the Five Cheese Queso Fundido with chips, which was blended at the table over a warmer. I split the Ancho Chicken burrito and Wild Mushroom quesadilla; both of which had great flavor. And we ended the meal with a Cuatro Leches Cake. Typically, I am a chocolate-dessert kind of girl, but this cake was amazing. Very moist and flavorful. I have also had the Cobb Salad with Ancho Shrimp and was a great, healthier option! Great options all around."}
{"text":"I was actually pleasantly surprised... moving here from AZ, I was leary about trying out a Mexican restaurant but it did meet my needs. The guac made at the tableside I highly recommend. I went with the fajitas and they did not disappoint. Large amount of food as well so I had plenty to take home for leftovers. Food went nicely with an ice cold Dos Equis amber on tap!"}
{"text":"This was the first time that we've eaten here and we really enjoyed it!  I had the pork burrito and my husband had the enchiladas and queso. The salad with the burrito was amazing   Can't wait to go back !!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great atmosphere and always good food and great service! I love the new location! The acoustics make it a little hard to have a conversation on busy nights, but it is ok because the food is so good, you are eating and not talking!  The cheerful and helpful staff is great!"}
{"text":"Let me start off with that Cantina has been my favorite Mexican place in Charlotte until recently. Ever since they have moved to the Park Road shopping center they have been lacking. This use to be my go to spot with friends on the weekend and to bring out of town guests, however something has changed since they moved. I feel like they are becoming more of a chain restaurant.   The service lately has been hit or miss, but mostly miss. Last time we were there (about a month ago) we had to ask for our waiter multiple times. But the worst part was the food. The menu hasn't changed (from the looks of it), but my husband and I order the SAME thing every time and something has changed. We get the  two taco combo: Ancho Polo and Marco Polo. The last time we ordered it the tacos were either not what we ordered or they changed the way they make the tacos. It tasted like a load of coleslaw on them. And not flavorful. They just didn't taste the same. We asked our server if they changed the ingredients, but she didn't know. Plus, the black beans are now brown pinto beans. Mehhh.   Not sure what's up with Cantina lately, but we tried Paco's a few weeks ago and fell in love. I hope Cantina can step it up again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times and found it to be average at best and greatly overpriced. The complimentary chips and salsa was excellent however. The chips were thin, fresh and tasty.   Ordered the chimichanga twice and it was large and nicely prepared but $13.95?! Come on! The enchiladas were okay and priced at $8 for two and $12 for three. Service was acceptable and atmosphere, attractive. Decent beer selections.  Still, there are better choices all around..."}
{"text":"Tonight I was hungry and was not disappointed! Excellent fresh guacamole made table side with plenty of  chips and salsa. Our chimichangas were hot and filling. We are never disappointed at Cantina 151!"}
{"text":"Great location (right by my office) and love the decor. Went in for a long lunch and sat. Y the big windows facing the street. Menu offered a lot of options and plenty of taco combos.   The service knocks this review down to 3 and I assume this is something they will improve. However, our waitress never gave us or offered refills until she took our plates away, chips were never refilled (long lunch remember) and our food came out cold.   Will come back after they have worked out some of the hiccups"}
{"text":"Cantina 1511, I want to love you but I cannot today.  As someone who lived in Texas for most his life and relocated to Charlotte by way of the northeast I was in great need of good Mexican.  Sadly I never got the chance due to logistics.  The food maybe good but I never got the opportunity to eat.  Upon arrival at 6pm my party of 4 were told it was to be 30 min.  Well that's acceptable.  45 min later we finally asked the status and the repose was 10 more min.  Where's the apology?  Well 10 minutes pasted and still not seated.  In actually a party of 5 whom arrived approx. 15 min after our arrival was seated.  So needless to say we walked.  A restaurant makes money on turning tables and Mexican restaurants typically do a great job at this due to the nature of Mexican food.  However, Cantina 1511 does not have logistics and management in place.  I hope to give it another go as the Mexican food choices in Ballantyne is very limited with Cantina 1511 cornering the market.  Know that my review is only to help as I want this place to succeed."}
{"text":"You know, I didn't have high expectations for this place but I can say that they sure do know how to cook a mean steak fajita.  The smell was so good when I walked in and I knew from looking around what I was going to get.  There comes a time in a mans life where he wants a great flavor and value.  The fajitas even had the peppers cooked just right and I don't even like peppers.  The only thing I can think of that kept me from giving a solid 5 stars would be the price.  It's a bit too pricey for what you get but others are saying this is more upscale.  I guess that's what they were going for but it's not really much more upscale than I'm used to.  Maybe I'm missing something.  The atmosphere is really welcoming and they have quick service.  The decor is newer and they have comfortable seating all around.  It was too cold to sit outside but I would have enjoyed that had it been a little warmer.  I will say this for some reason they seem to be a little slower if you are only ordering take-out which doesn't make a whole lot of since to me but hey whatever.  The chips and salsa is good it's nothing special.  The sweet tea was a bit under sweetened to my liking but the rest of my party seemed to think it was okay. What can I say I'm from Georgia and I love my sweet tea well you know sweet.  I would definitely give this spot a go.  They do reservations but each time I have been I didn't need one.  I guess it's all about the time and day you go.  Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food, reasonable prices and very good lite margharitas.  We were very pleased with the food, service, cleanliness and price.  Highly recommended to Mexican food fans, though I wish the music had been better."}
{"text":"I've been a longtime fan of this place and the margaritas. Came in on a Sunday and there was no wait which is not the norm for Charlotte. I recently have been ordering the anojittos (forgive the spelling) b/c it's the chef's pick of street food. I've never been disappointed with this pick. This time around I received friend zucchini, mini nachos, mini tostadas and churros with chocolate and what I believe to be a cherry/berry reduction. All I can say is yummy.     We also love the chips here and the salsa. The chips are thin with the perfect amount of salt. They always bring two bowls of salsa which is appreciated (especially with double dippers in your party )."}
{"text":"I met a friend of mine for a drink at Cantina 1511 right after work on a Wednesday.  It was just after 5 pm, and the restaurant was empty.  There were two bartenders mulling around behind the bar -- it took them about 5 full minutes to find and open 2 Coronas.   We then moved into the dining room for appetizers and drinks with a larger group.  To say the service was slow would be a vast understatement.  It took 15-20 minutes to get a drink (some margaritas, some beers), if you got them at all.  We were there for about an hour and several people had outstanding drinks that never arrived.  Did I mention the restaurant was not busy?  We also had orders of shrimp, chicken and beef skewers -- all of which were very tasty -- except for the ones with RAW chicken.  Not sort of undercooked -- but, barely cooked.  The guac was outstanding.  The 3-star rating is generous because i LOVED the Cantina 1511 on East Blvd, so I'm hoping this was just an off night."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the food quality. It was salty as all get out. The queso literally had no flavor. The guacamole tasted old. The kid's quesadilla was bland. And salty. And my chimichanga was greasy. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Ok, came here on a Friday night at 5:30 (not busy at the moment) and the service thus far is sub par.  We ordered drinks which took 30 minutes.  The second round we are currently waiting on has taken another 30 minutes (still not here).  My friend has ordered wine, twice, yet still no wine... nearly ONE HOUR later.  The food may be decent, but it is clouded in with worst customer service I have ever experienced.  We have been to other locations and loved them, this was a HUGE let down.  I would go for Vida Cantina if you are headed downtown for food."}
{"text":"Great! If you're white and have never left home.  Seriously disappointed. Menu touts authentic Mexican food but the servers walked out of the Abercrombie and Fitch catalog and the only Brown faces are relegated to bus boys. If you're selling me Mexican food, hire Mexicans to cook it, sell it and serve it and let the white boys do the dishes. Speaking of diversity, do any African Americans work here? No, I don't want to see pics of you and your black friend.  Let's start with the salsa. Tastes like it uses canned tomato sauce. I asked for and added fresh cilantro, lime and salt and it was Not quite nearly edible.   I ordered 2 tacos: duck carnitas and Baja fish. They were both covered in some terrible pink picked onions. The duck taco had 2 extra ingredients...half an avocado and an inch long piece of bone that I had to fish out of my throat.   There are a million ways to make this taco better but step 1 would be stop trying to be so pretentious. Mexican food is humble elegance. The fish taco was unimpressive, after I excavated it from it's pickled onion tomb the fish was dry. This was served with a slaw that tasted fresh and was the only actual GOOD thing on the plate. It was also served with black beans (no seasoning, no taste) and some white rice with ugly canned peas and corn it it. Like they bought the cheapest frozen veggies they could find and threw it in.  The very white manager came by to see how I enjoyed my meal. I asked him what region of Mexico their food was from....he couldn't tell me.....he did mention all the cooks are Mexican when I told him this is white people food dressed up like Mexican food for people who have never traveled and don't know any better. He offered to comp my meal, I declined. He insisted on telling me how they roast the tomatoes for their salsa and all of the food was created by Mexican chefs.   Don't waste your money. Not authentic, flavor profiles lack cohesion and originality, if they have real Mexicans working they hide them in the lowest paying jobs while profiting off their culture."}
{"text":"I went with a group of friends, and there was a great atmosphere here. I didn't really care for the high stools at the table we were seated at, but there may be other options. The chips and salsa was probably some of the best I've had. The steak chimichanga I had there was pretty good. The texture was perfectly crispy, but the fillings (steak, veggies, rice) were realllly salty. Also, my bf ordered a drink, a double shot of tequila and for 9 bucks per shot, that was a $20 drink! That's a bottle! Anyway, overall it was a good night and the prices were somewhat high for casual Mexican, but I might try this place again."}
{"text":"I love Cantina.  This is not straight-up mexican food, so if you are lloking for grease than dont go to this restaurant.  That said, the food her is great and the portions are huge.  If you go for lunch the prices are cheaper but the portions are just as large, so I recommend lunch.   Many of their dishes come in a small or large size, so you can pick how much food you want.  Lunch can be under $10, but with drinks dinner will cost $15.  I highly recommend the chicken tostada salad and the barbicoa pork.  Half price margs on Tuesdays!!"}
{"text":"There's no easy way to put this, after going here I feel violated.  I ordered the grilled pork loin and my wife ordered the vegetable picadillo enchiladas.  I was served two crispy burned pork loins floating in a bland \"peanut\" sauce that tasted like it belonged more on a Thai menu.  The plate was over sauced, the \"queso mashed potatoes\" were bland and as hard as a rock...  Then there were the slightly burned, out of season asparagus, no crisp to them, just limpy old food.  To make matters worse, my wife's dish was inedible.  She was served, no joke, instant rice with dried peas and carrots.  They at least squeezed some lime juice on it.  The vegetables in the soggy tortillas were over cooked to the point that they were little rubber bits of bitter tasting vegetables.  We're not picky eaters, but this honestly was an insult served to us on a plate.  I would have sent it all back but our server quickly grabbed our plates and bagged it up for us after she saw we weren't eating.  This was honestly the worst meal I have ever been served that came out of a professional kitchen.  Take my advice, drive five more minutes down the road and go to Senor Tequila."}
{"text":"I had been craving guacamole for about a week and me and my sister decided on Cantina to help me sate that craving.  we got there around 7 and it was pretty busy, but I had made a reservation before we left the house.  They have $10 off pitchers of any margaritas on Thursday's, so we got the house and my guac to start.  Pitcher was huge!!  I really wasn't expecting it to be so big and with just the 2 of us it was too much.  We were both so full from liquids that I barely ate dinner, which was the barbacoa.  Guac was pretty good, maybe too much lime juice though.  Barbacoa was good, never had it before but it did seem a bit dry to me, still tasty though.  Sister got garlic shrimp, tasted like scampi but they were yummy.  Dessert was quatros leches, good but they put a meringue top on it and it was not needed and we scraped it off.  Our server was great and made sure our water was never empty and we had plenty of chips.  Only thing that was annoying, and is totally my fault, I had a Citi Pass coupon and didn't realize till the next day so we could have gotten 1 entree freeish.  Oh well my fault for never remembering to check that book!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. It seems like I go about every 6 months because it takes about that long to forget the prior experience.   I had the Chimichanga (fried burrito). There is no way that it is better than the Qdoba across the parking lot. It's basically the same thing. But this is true of a lot of Mexican food - it seems like you pay double if it comes with a plate. Someone has to wash a plate. So maybe that makes sense.  3 people - no alcohol - no drinks (water) - no appetizer - 3 entries and the bill including tip was over $50.00. Fast food Mexican without the plate for the same meal would have been less than $20.00.  Maybe it will be better 6 months from now - I'll keep you posted !"}
{"text":"The chips were delivered quickly and were light, crispy and warm, the guacamole made table side was awesome - fresh (of course) and very spicy! We each had a margarita on the rocks, one Corona and we split the steak fajitas - total bill $58 with tip - not bad but I would have expected a little less splitting an entree. oh well.   The atmosphere was fun - got lucky with the leftover snow and ice outside b/c we were seated without having to wait even though the restaurant was mostly full.   Service was excellent. Good casual date spot.   My only gripe was that the fajitas needed a little more meat in addition to the ample amount of veggies - otherwise Cantina would have gotten 4 stars."}
{"text":"Food is good...Service was terrible.  My husband and I had to ask 4 times (asked different people still no silverware,  one person even said they were washing it, guess they need to raise the silver pare level here) to get silverware to eat our meal with.  It got so bad that my husband asked a different server walking by our table if they even have any silverware, by the time we got silverware our food was cold) Absolutely NO manager presence on the floor at all.  Restaurant really is good food wise but the management team is not doing anything to make the service/dining experience work.  Try replacing management or at least have them visible to the patrons and then train the service staff."}
{"text":"Sorry kids, after hearing many people raving about this place, my girlfriend and i finally decided that we needed our Mexican fix. We love Mexican food, but apparently we have become too accustomed to the run of the mill 'authentic' Mexican food. Not the Chipotle or Moes, but the sit-down  restaurant with menus with wet burritos and a listing of 30+ numbered dishes.  i had a traditional Mexican dish, while she had  a Tex Mex burrito. Her burrito was huge, but she only eat a few bites, It just wasn't good. i had the traditional enchiladas and they were slightly more edible, however, we wouldn't go back for either dish. The beans were like a bad bean soup, the rice didn't have much taste (other than the peas mixed in),   The atmosphere was great and the server was very attentive and i really wanted to like the place, but i can't say i'll be back."}
{"text":"The service was excellent, so was the food: we had the guacamole, the pork belly tacos and the nachos for starters. Everything was delicious and came out promptly, specially the pork belly tacos. I had tacos, duck, beef and Texas, delicious as well."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch today, service was Ok honestly nothing to complain about. The food was another story, I ordered creamy chicken enchiladas they were just gross. They were not at all creamy, the chicken was just compacted inside the enchilada and tasted old, not creamy at all. They topped it with circles of dried up red onion.. why? Definitely way too dry for \"creamy\" chicken. I also tried to use a teachers discount which they eventually accepted but said that it would not be valid in the future. If you want to end a coupon that's fine but just end it! Don't leave it up on my employee app then tell me it's just supposed to be just for a kid's back to school special and threaten to not accept it. It was specifically for the park road location... I just don't like being made to feel like a beggar when I try and use a teacher discount as advertised."}
{"text":"Still one of our favorite Tex-Mex spots!  The new location is not as intimate as the East Blvd location (the only reason this is not a 5 star rating) but they are able to accommodate more customers, so the trade-off for me is worth it.  I have never been disappointed with the meals or the service and the guacamole is consistently outstanding!  One time our server even stopped in the middle of the table-side guacamole prep and said he could not finish since the avocados he selected were not perfectly ripe.  He promptly returned with new avocados and delivered perfection in a bowl that was spiced exactly to our taste.  Very impressive!  The predominant style is indeed Tex-Mex which is my favorite but I understand it may not suit everyone.  That said there are a few \"authentic Mexican\" dishes that my wife gravitates toward and she is as big a fan of Cantina 1511 as I am.  Enjoy, but plan to get there early on Friday evening if you want to be seated quickly."}
{"text":"Food was horrible and service was not good... Our waitress disappeared half way through our meal...  The fajitas where not cooked very well... He chicken was not cooked all the way... The tortillas where cold.... Horrible experience...."}
{"text":"I've been here many times, but after my most recent meal the other night I figured it's about dang time I write a review.  Simply put, this place is great.  If you like guacamole, this is the place for you.  They make it at the table while you watch, and you can have it seasoned to your taste.  It's a bit pricey to get the guacamole, but it's pretty delicious.  Just be prepared because you'll get a LOT of guac.  If you don't like the guacamole, you will probably be pretty satisfied with the complimentary salsa.    If you like tequila, you have come to the right place.  There are plenty of different types and there is a good variety of margaritas.  I am more of a beer man, myself.  There aren't a lot of drafts to choose from, but they have Dos Equis Amber and when I'm eating Mexican food that is good enough for me.  So what really inspired me to write this review was the dish I had the other night, the barbacoa de puerco.  I cannot believe I've been to Cantina so many times without trying this thing but it was amazing.  The dish consisted of slow cooked, shredded pork with pico, guacamole, and charro beans and rice.  The pork was tender, juicy, flavorful, and delicious.  It came with flour tortillas to load up with the meat and sides.  It possibly the best Mexican meal I've had.    If you aren't interested in the barbacoa, I'd recommend to get some tacos.  There are about 10 different types so there's something for everyone.    In conclusion, if you like Mexican food you need to go here.  Be sure to make a reservation if you're going on Friday or Saturday.  If you don't, you will likely be waiting for a while.  Standing around waiting for 45 minutes watching the waiters carry around the delicious looking and wonderful smelling hot plates is a torturous experience."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great, we were in and out in an hour, on Saturday night. Table side guacamole was great, it would have been nice to have a choice of spice/hot level. The Birdsong Jalapeño APA (American Pale Ale), was a great beer, it is a full body beer with a hint of pepper that fads away, making it easy to drink. My wife got the house margarita (frozen) and said it was one of her favorites."}
{"text":"This place is not your ordinary Mexican Food place. It had a concept like Chilis/Applebee's where you order 3 - appetizer, entree, dessert to share. Not sure if it's a regular concept, but it does save money. (Not that I eat at either of those places, but I am familiar. ;)) They make the at the table guacamole which was really tasty and fresh. I'm not sure if this is a chain, but I'm almost certain it's not the owners first restaurant because it was run efficiently and well. They have Sunday Ticket so you can see the games, and plenty of TV's which was great. Whether you're with a group or just a partner, this is a great spot. Lots of drink options as well, the margaritas were good, and their low quality tequila is still 100% agave. As for quality, it's absolutely worth the price. Waitress was attentive and nice, I'd recommend the restaurant."}
{"text":"Oh, Cantina 1511, how you bring out the Mexican fiesta in me!    I've just had wonderful dining experiences here and I would highly recommend it for a few venues:  1) girls or boys night out 2) laidback, but not too casual first date 3) celebration evening (i.e. birthday, anniversary)  Quick and dirty review:  1) Excellent, tasty food.  You must get the guacamole.  The waiter will make it right at your table with fresh, whole ingredients. 2) Service was outstanding.  Waiter was attentive, but sure not to rush us (even during restuarant week when the wait was over an hour). 3) Prices won't kill your wallet.  You're likely to even leave with leftovers.  Gotta love 2 meals for 1.   4) Drinks are very yummy. 5) Atmosphere is casual yet not too informal.  My only complaint is that during busy hours parking is very scarce.  Although, if you have a few bucks you can vallet!    Muy bueno, Cantina!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come to Cantina often just to sit down and have their fresh tableside guac! Their food and service is always spot on and we never leave disappointed or hungry"}
{"text":"It has been years since I have been to Cantina 1511 (the other location on East Blvd).  Food review: The chips were over salty and greasy.  The guacamole made fresh at the table was pretty good, I only wish it had some more tomatoes in it.  My meal was not very good - the chicken and spinach enchiladas.  They were really bland.  Not much seasoning.  I had to dump a bunch of salsa on they to even be interested in eating my meal.  The beans seemed like they were not totally cooked all the way, as they were sort of hard.     Quite honestly, I remember the food being better at the other location.  Maybe I caught them on a bad night?  Or maybe the other location is better."}
{"text":"This place is way over priced and food taste terrible. Definitely don't get the cheese dip taste like cardboard."}
{"text":"The food: I ordered the crab & avocado quesadilla, some queso & chips.... Whew! Lots of food! I did not finish it all. The quesadilla was REALLY good! The crab tasted like real crab, not imitation crap. The queso was awesome, came with it's own flame under the fondue bowl to keep the queso hot.   The Decor: Great! The patio is really nice. They have one long table for large groups.   The service: JULIANNA was my attentive, but not annoying waitress. She kept my drinks flowing and always had a smile when passing by my table.   Recommend? Yes especially for groups..."}
{"text":"It's.so. Bad. When this place was on east blvd I only went twice and truly thought the food was not impressive. It's been at park rd shopping center now for a while and I have been several times in an attempt to give it another chance. Every time I go the food is awful. I tried 3 different tacos tonight and I couldn't even finish two of them, not to mention there was a random shrimp in one of them, which was an allergy hazard. Shelley was awesome, funny, personable and very sweet. Otherwise, in the future I will not succumb to a couples dinner here when suggested"}
{"text":"Just meh. This place has changed so much since they were at the East Blvd. location. The food quality has definitely gone down; the people I were with also all felt the same way. I ordered the carne asada tacos which were room temperature and bland when they were brought out. I asked the waiter for cheese for that tacos and later found out I was charged $1.00 for the cheese. I thought cheese was a required taco topping but I guess not at Cantina 1511. Pros were that the mimosa I ordered was made well and the service was fairly quick."}
{"text":"We were in a large party and they had the best little 7 layer salad to go with the chips and salsa. Our waiter said he never saw them before, so I don't know how we lucked up on that! They also did steak and chicken fajitas and I loved the steak and my sis loved the chicken. I wish I had one for leftovers now. Mmmm.   Service was great, even though I'm sure our party of people in and out to smoke and whatnot was annoying. The parking is pretty bad, but free after 6 and the bathroom needed a little attention."}
{"text":"There was a 45 minute wait time on a Friday evening, but we got our table as promised. The menu was an interesting mix of authentic Mexican food and Mexican burgers. We went for the usuals, tacos, Fajitas and the burger. Our waitress was extremely friendly and provided us a great hospitality. There are hardly few waitresses who would care for your well being, she was one of them. Forgot to get her name. The chips and salsa were not the best but medium sized and okay. The food came in without much delay. I got the El Diablo burger and it was a killer! Double patty and super spicy! I tried but couldn't complete the whole burger in one sitting. Overall we had a good experience. And for an upscale restaurant that looked really fashionable it wasn't that expensive. 30 to 40$ for food and drinks for two! Great deal I would say. If you wouldn't mind the wait time, I say check it out!"}
{"text":"Love coming here, especially for margs on the patio! Good food and friendly staff every time!"}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try because I was hungry and it was right across the street from where I was shopping. Even though I should have know better by now that most of \"authentic\" Mexican food in Charlotte has not been good or authentic. I ordered the enchiladas Tejanos because the description sounded good. However, the best part of the meal were the beans. The \"oaxaca' cheese tasted nothing like real oaxaca but reminded me of gooey monterrey jack. I have never tasted barbacoa that is these sweet. In my opinion, Chipotle's barbacoa is more authentic. I just can not like the flavors that I've found in the so called Mexican food joints around here. I will stick to the few hole-in-the-wall spots for my Mexican food."}
{"text":"Lived here for three years and just discovered this place. Amazing!  I grew up in Los Angeles so I know good ethnic food.  WOW!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here on a Sunday evening. We arrived at 7:30pm after seeing a movie at the Regal in the same complex. What a disappointment honestly! We didn't select this restaurant based off of Yelp reviews, but instead we came here out of convenience.  We started off ordering two house margaritas on the rocks, 1 with salt and 1 without. Both came with salt and I was disappointed but didn't even point it out to the waiter because I didn't want to be \"that person.\"    We didn't order an appetizer because we had popcorn at the theater so we smacked on the complimentary chips and salsa which were tasty. Chips were crisp and lightly salted. Salsa may have been jarred or homemade but had a kick to it.   We decided to try the date night special for $25 where we could each pick an Entrée from a limited menu and then could share a dessert. I ordered a chimichanga with steak and specifically asked for no sour cream. My husband ordered a chimichanga with chicken with everything on it.   The food came out about ten minutes later. (Almost too fast?) The waiter handed me what seemed to be the correct plate until we cut into it and found they reversed our orders. So then we had to switch plates and I had to scrape the sour cream off of mine. This may not seem like a big deal however the sour cream was touching the slaw and lettuce in addition to touching the beans and queso that was spilling over the chimichanga. I personally abhor sour cream so I was really annoyed.    Then I noticed I had about a teaspoon of guacamole on my plate AND no pico de Gallo. Meanwhile my husband had generous portions of each. I was pretty annoyed at this point. The waiter bought me a tiny thing of pico de gallo which was appreciated. Honestly the food wasn't very good anyway and the guacamole tasted pretty bland.   The churros that accompanied the meal took longer than the meal did to come out and that's probably because they were over fried. The Melba sauce served on the side tasted like something poured out of jar or bottle and was extremely sweet.    All in all, I was very disappointed with attention to detail and the taste/quality of the food served. We will not be back."}
{"text":"I love avocados, but after eating a ton of this goodness with this restaurant's delicious, made at your table guacamole, seeing a thick slice of fatty avocado on top of every other part of my meal was a bit overmuch.   But get the guacamole. The spinach enchiladas were also good, if very cheesy. The black beans were a little salty.  The corn fritters were talked up by our server, but they didn't really deliver, and I'm unsure I would serve them as a desert. The peach dessert was much better, probably because we are in Cackalack while they are in season!  The service was outgoing and friendly, helpful and quick to attention. Good service.  This is Mexican that is supposedly fancified, but it seems mostly you're just paying more for stuff that seems to be modestly better than the cheap, gut-busting stuff. Try it for yourself, but I'm going to keep lookin!"}
{"text":"Happy hour: Amazing, Cheap, and Drinks! I came here for a happy hour with a friend of mine (which was really a failed party, which became like a default date...) The appetizers were filling, and the drinks weren't too bad on the price. I think that there should have been a little bit more space, except I wasn't too worried about it because it was just the two of us.  Overall, I would come here for happy hour itself. South Charlotte isn't quite my scene so I don't think I would get to try out the other dinner options. We'll see if that changes though."}
{"text":"Roger was attentive. Food was amazing. Even got a margarita and it was on point! Could not be happier with my experience. Always good when I go somewhere, enjoy the food, and so does my kid."}
{"text":"Is it the BEST Mexican spot out there?  Probably not, but it is VERY good! You have to get an order of guacamole- its pretty darn good. All the dishes are great, again, never had a bad meal here. Very busy at night, but don't let it stop you; its in a great neighborhood to explore for a bit if you have to! Good Chips n' Salsa Descent size bar- but can be very crowded. Parking can be tight too- all depends on when you go. The neighborhood is Dilworth"}
{"text":"It's not often my family finds a place that everyone loves. Usually, someone won't eat.... Well, not this time.. Everything was awesome food, service and they easy to find."}
{"text":"I've been here three times, and each time I've never been disappointed. The fish tacos are delectable, the chopped salad is delicious and I usually end up eating so much of their awesome salsa and chips that I barely have room for my entree. I've tried the Salmon al Pastor and both the presentation and flavors are wonderful. The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is because I've been told they're working on adding to the menu so I'm waiting for this place to be even more awesome."}
{"text":"The Cobb salad with salmon is delish. Got the cuatro leches cake for the table. Perfect way to end a great meal."}
{"text":"Best fajitas and burritos! My girlfriend and I love Cantina for Sunday lunch! Great margarita made with fresh juice! We like to sit in the bar so we can watch football."}
{"text":"So I've never actually sat down and had a full meal here before, but I do enjoy any place with chips, salsa, and margaritas.  The chips and salsa are great. Queso is pretty on point, but only if you like Parmesan cheese. Guac is made in front of you. If you like spicy I recommend getting the hot because the medium is not spicy at all.  Margaritas could be stronger."}
{"text":"What a horrible place. I'm sorry to see this open up in Park Road Shopping Center. I've been twice, and the infractions upon standard treatment of human beings is atrocious. I'm not one to give bad reviews, but this is not my kind of restaurant. Awful customer service, attention to detail, acknowledgement that you've even come *in*. The list goes on."}
{"text":"Good food (chicken chichanga rocked), good atmosphere, nice servers, overall a good experience. A tad high in price and don't expect a huge portion but the taste and quality are excellent.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped by today for lunch. The service was average-- I wasn't floored by our waiter, but he wasn't awful or anything and our food came out quite quickly. We ordered queso fundido for the table, the cheese had a nice consistency and stretch, but there was a smokiness to it that I wasn't really vibing with. I ordered the chimichanga with steak and it was just okay, kinda heavy on the rice and beans and not much else. My friends ordered the tostada salad and the avocado hamburger, both of which seemed to be hits. Overall, it was an average experience with average food. There are other options nearby that I enjoy a little more, so I'm definitely not tripping over myself to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Wow I was sad I had to write a poor review for the resturant I had high hopes. First the atmosphere was nice,clean and relaxing. The service was great but the food was over the top salty. I love mexican food and I can eat it everyday but not here. I enjoyed the salsa but the chips were to salty the the dinner which was nachos it taste like I was eating nothing but salt. I am not sure why this was. I had to drink alot of water to flush out my body. Would I try again probably not I just had better and not worth the drive for me."}
{"text":"WHY ???  did you change the chips?????    So disappointed last night.  We went to Cantina instead of On the Border just because of the chips and salsa. Now you've gone and changed the chips.  The old ones were better!!!!!!   Please change back."}
{"text":"Went to Cantina 1511 over the weekend and have been there a few other times over the last year; we've literally had the exact same experience every time: painfully bad service and decent Mexican food. This location is seriously in my no fly zone just based off how bad the service is here. Our food has always taken way longer than it should and some part of our order is inevitably screwed up. The wait staff and front desk are super friendly, but god help me something needs to change about the dine-in service.   Aside from the service, Cantina 1511 doesn't do anything particularly well. The Margaritas are usually over-priced and too sugary. The food is fine, but not anything better than any other Mexican restaurant int the Charlotte area. Truthfully, the only reason we went this weekend was because it was close, and we are SUPER lazy.   I wouldn't necessarily recommend against Cantina, but I wouldn't go out of my way to tell people to go here."}
{"text":"Margarita please!  I like this place!  Service is good, food is good, margaritas are great!  I love that the skinny margaritas aren't full of fake sweeteners but literally a smaller version of the regular.  The guacamole is tableside and good but make sure they don't try to put unripened avocados in there... They've tried it once.  I just love the mushroom tacos.  A nice fresh spin on veggie tacos.  The outdoor seating is nice a spacious and quiet during the day if you need to get some work done!  The salads are tasty too... Jicama makes everything taste better imo...  Still my go to spot in stonecrest... Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Got the orange duck and it was very close to 4 stars. My only complaint is the duck was a bit fatty and tough. The salsa on top was fresh and tasted a bit like lime. The rice was fluffy, light and very fresh as well. The black beans on the side was so so; not bad or good. The guacamole is made in front of you; very fresh. The only reason I didn't give this place 4 stars is the duck could have been less fatty.  I would come here again."}
{"text":"I've tried very hard to give this place a chance, but after THREE visits, I just can't anymore.  The last time I went was last Friday, 11/11/2016, the Friday after election day.  The first drink I had was the Cadillac, their signature margarita.  It was so sweet, it took me a very long time to get through it.  For 16$, I expect my drink to be top notch delicious and to the standard expected.  Nothing close.  The second drink I ordered was a regular margarita, with patron tequila.  A diffferent drink  HAS to be better.  Absolutely WORSE!  It was SO SICKLY sweet, I could only get through 1/4 of the drink, and I LOVE my drinks.  I even let my boyfriend try a sip, and he is a non-drinker and a bad choice to be a critic because he doesn't like alcohol that much.  He LOVED the fact that it was SO sweet, which is a TERRIBLE indicator.  Nevertheless, we left there with 3/4 of my expensive patron margarita.  I ordered the street pizza which was on the app menu for 10$.  It was just OK.  I ate 2 slices and left the rest.  My bf ordered the beef and chicken fajitas.  I tried the beef and it was very chewy, not tender in any way.  I had the shrimp fajitas the time before when we were there and they were decent, but nothing to write home about or give a great review for.  The sides that the fajitas come with are ok, You get a group of sliced carrots with cheese, lettuce and some guac.  No rice or beans unless you order those separately,, but you still pay a premium price for the plate.  Its sad because I wanted to really like this place, but just can't.  I would choose any mexican spot in Charlotte over Cantina 1511.  The food quality for such an expensive price, along with the drinks as well (well, if you know the bartender working that night, or know who he/she is/was, then they were HORRIBLE!!!!! and need to know that!!!) in such a cool hot spot is totally NOT worth any of it.  I don't even think my rating should be poor at 2 stars, it really should be TERRIBLE, 1 star.  Cantina 1511, you need to revamp everything if you want to continue to do decent business.  I'm so sorry and disappointed that it is this bad.  :("}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Service was great. Love their salsa which is big for me. The food was average in my opinion but I'll be back."}
{"text":"Average Tex Mex restaurant, don't expect anything to waw you.... The staff are great, Brad was awesome. If you live in the area and you're up for some bland filling Tex Mex meal than go for it, portions are healthy..."}
{"text":"Stopped here after an event at the Mint museum. Since I was with the kiddo's we ordered the nacho's with beef, along with mahi mahi taco's for me. Nacho's were immense and loaded - big enough for four people! The homemade queso was great, btw.   Fish taco's were ok, but I've had better in CLT. Overall vibe is great here, service was average."}
{"text":"Girls day out! We started with the table side guacamole, and queso. Both were great. I had the choose 2 taco combo, with the gobernador tacos, black beans and rice. The shrimp in the tacos were plump and juicy. The salsa and slaw that accompanied were wonderful.   Washed it all down with a orange Tijuana taxi, with a gran marnier side car. Excellent meal, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Not really impressed. It's placed had been talked up by so many people I knew and was just pretty average to me. Definitely willing to try it again."}
{"text":"Wow...  Had not been in a few years, an my how things have changed.  Our server (Jessica) did not have a clue as to how to wait tables.  I am not sure if it was lack of training or simply her lackadaisical demeanor.  There were crushed chips under at least 40% of the tables with no effort to clean between diners.  We were given some \"gluten free\" chips and told they were out of regular chips.  WOW!!  Later in the meal these BAGGED chips were swapped out with not fresh fried but room temperature house made chips.  The server took my empty glass to refill my tea.  While she was away with my glass a server delivered our food, we at that point asked for silverware.  WOW!!  Jessica passed our table five times without returning my tea.  Twelve minutes later after she had passed the fifth time she returned with another glass of tea.  Cheese dip was good, and dinner was very good.  Though not what I ordered with the server.  Food is well worth the trip, but doubt I will be returning due to the extremely poor service."}
{"text":"First and foremost I have been to Cantina 1511 before and the food and service has always been fantastic but today I went and had a horrible experience. I decided to stop in by myself to order some food, once I was seated and placed my order I went to the restroom to wash my hands why is it that a waitress that wasn't mine cleared my appetizer and drink from my table? She brought me out another one and said she was sorry so I let it go, but when my food came out I found debris in it, the waiter stated that he would have another plate remade for me so when the next plate came out there was a long piece of hair wedged in the meal, needless to say my appetite was destroyed and I left the restaurant, Cantina 1511 is definitely off my eating list."}
{"text":"Wow! With all of the great reviews, including Zaguts, I was really disappointed. I gave 2 stars b/c the server was great. The food....well, the salsa was too salty, taking away from the blend of flavors; the chips were very greasy(undoubtedly the reason for my upset stomach the rest of the day...oh, we went for lunch); I chose 1 of the 2 most popular maragrita's (so the waiter said)...not the 1511, but his other recommendation.  BORING!! And yes, good tequlia is smooth, especially w/the right mixers, but this was just flat in so many ways. I had the soft chicken taco lunch w/beans only, however they put abt 1 tablespoon of slaw on my plate. The meat was dry and tasted like a dirty grill, the drizzeled sauce was some horrible sweet mayo concoction. Not my favorite."}
{"text":"I was expecting to be a little more blown away by Cantina especially since its one of Charlotte's more established Mexican restaurants but I found it be all right.  I joined my friend for some margaritas on a Saturday evening (the place wasn't busy at all at 5:30ish). We started with the complimentary chips and salsa - both excellent! nice crunchy, slightly salty chips and salsa with a little bit of a kick, just the way I like it! We also decided to go for the tableside guac - nice and chunky but could've used a tad more salt/lime.   I decided to go with the Pina (pineapple) margarita and my friend had the strawberry. Both deliciously strong!! I went with the two taco combo: fish & pork tacos. I was slightly disappointed in their refried beans and rice. Neither were particularly indicative of traditional Mexican beans and rice and the portion was teeny tiny!   I don't know if I'll be rushing to go back as I can always count on my trusty Paco's to make an even better marg and taco but I won't count out Cantina"}
{"text":"Interesting concept. I was genuinely impressed by this place. I ordered the lunch steak quesadillas and they were pretty good.   What stood out from me was the level of service by our waitress. She knew just about everything i asked her and she was very attentive to my needs. 5 stars for her.   My 1511 margarita with herradura tequila was average at best. It was way too sour for my taste.   This place is much more expensive than most mexican restaurants. $17 for steak fajitas seems a little overkill for me. Overall though not a bad place."}
{"text":"Ok. So pretty amazing lunch today. Went with some work colleagues. Today they had a little exhibition of some live entertainment. Apparently they have something going on every day of the week. We had the table side Guac which is made to your level of spice. I needed more and they brought me out a side of Serrano peppers. Ask for the habanero salsa if you really want to kick it off. They also have 9.95 lunch specials which include a drink. I had the two Barbacoa tacos. If you have not tried their barbacoa. You must. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today (Thursday). Food was great which is why I gave them 3 Stars. My recommendation is not to sit in the bar. The bartender, never gave his name and seemed distant, and distracted. Almost unapproachable. I felt I was imposing asking for more iced  The salsa had a little extra heat which I enjoyed.  Chips were crisp and yummy. I had the mushroom quesadilla  which was outstanding.  Like I said, I wouldn't recommend sitting in the bar area unless you have to. This was not my first visit and I've never seen this particular bartender. But he was so off putting that I felt others should know. Stay away from the bar on Thursday mornings. Other than that I highly recommend."}
{"text":"In the beginning We placed our name to be seated and we were skipped, when we went to the desk to check why, they rudely said it was our fault that they have been texting us multiple times. When I did not get messages and showed the lady in the desk that I only received the one text message that let us know we checked in, they then apologized and sat us after being so rude. If we would had not noticed who knows how long we would have been sitting outside waiting. We ordered the queso and didn't get the tortillas that go with it, we asked one of the waitresses to bring the tortillas and she never did so we asked someone else to and she did bring them. Waitress kept skipping us when she was doing rounds for her table section. Also after being so frustrated after this meal the sugar rim margarita I ordered was a bitter salt rim! This was my first experience and definitely my last one at cantina 1511. The only highlight of my experience was the bar staff, they were so awesome and nice. They didn't know how to make my drink but did their best to provide me what I asked for."}
{"text":"Another nice meal at 1511. The red sangria and los 1511 marg hit the spot. The salsa and chips were excellent and our mains of chicken quesadillas and chicken enchiladas were tasty and well prepared.  The service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Cantina, pull it together. I was super excited to try the new Park Road location and even more excited that they were opening for weekend brunch, but this experience was one miss after another. I'm hoping it's just because they're in a new location and trying to get acclimated, but...  We got there on a Sunday at 9:00 am when they open, and I wasn't sure we'd walked in the correct door because there was a ladder in the lobby and numerous cardboard boxes, and construction workers were milling around. A guy walked up to me, and I asked if they were open; he said they were, gave us his name (but I still have no idea if was the owner, manager, etc.), and proceeded to take us on a tour of the new location. Call me cranky, but it's early on a Sunday morning, and I haven't had any coffee - just seat me and feed me! He let us pick where to sit, which some might appreciate, but I can't make decisions before coffee, and the new location is so huge, I felt overwhelmed. He also came over again mid-meal to tell the fella how they have TVs and the NFL Sunday Ticket in case he's into football or fantasy football.   Our waiter was super weird. He kept trying to pronounce the words on the menu in Spanish (being funny?), so he asked us how we liked the \"Mehican\" food and tried rolling his r's. It was awkward to say the least. He rarely made eye contact with us because he was watching the TV over our shoulder. He also never refilled our drinks, and when I finally asked about more coffee, he forgot. I waited and waited, and when I finally saw him again, he told me they were out of coffee and it was brewing. This was at 9:25 when they'd been open for 25 minutes, there were literally 4 people in the place, and one of them - the fella - wasn't even drinking coffee. The cup he finally brought me was so bad I couldn't even drink it. Thankfully the waitress for other couple saw that we were out of water and refilled that.  Onto the food... I got the Mexican Lager Pancakes with bananas, scrambled eggs, and bacon. The bacon was way spicier than I'd planned on, but the pancakes were good. The banana slices come in the batter (much like they do other places), but our waiter made a scene out of yelling to the kitchen staff that there were no bananas, and then he made me cut into my pancakes to prove that they were in there. For. The. Love. The fella got the Chorizo Burrito, which was deliciousy cheesy. Oddly enough, our waiter brought chips and salsa to our table... at 9:00 a.m.  Alllll that said, the new location is bright and spacious, and I'm glad for the ample parking. I'll try again, but not for a loooong time til I let you guys try it out and give me the \"all clear\" to go back."}
{"text":"Always busy, this East Boulevard restaurant has great food. Best thing on the menu- Barbacoa! Order it as an entree, or in tacos. They have a top shelf /handcrafted margarita menu that produces outstanding drinks.   Table-side Guacamole is the best in town!   Perfect spot to meet friends and enjoy some terrific food. And, if you need it, they have a kids menu.  Also, th eparking lot is fairly small, but valet parking is usually available at the front door."}
{"text":"The food is just ok. The drinks are the only reason to go in my book. The blood orange margarita is amazing. I have tried several things but not hit has ever been outstanding there."}
{"text":"This place used to be a hit for me on east blvd, but no longer does it for me with the new location.  The previous location had more of a fancy, small location type of feel to it.  The new location is definitely more accommodating, but has lost what was previously mentioned.  Now it feels more like a big, open, casual, and loud atmosphere.  I can't help but compare Cantina to Paco's Taco's down in South Park, which at this point has Cantina beaten in pretty much every meaningful way for me.  The food is tastier, the vibe is classier, and dollar for dollar it is cheaper.  Also, no more duck tacos?  Why remove such a great thing?"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Cantina 1511 Uptown several times, have had them cater 2 of my parties and recently attended the karaoke night with some friends. I love this place. The food is delicious, their guacamole is the best in town and their margaritas are on point! Highly recommend Cantina for lunch, dinner, catering or a night out!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to learn about there skinny margaritas and the fresh made table side guacamole! My husband got salmon and potatoes and they where seasoned perfectly! I got the chicken burrito and it was ginormous! Chips and fresh salsa are served when you sit down."}
{"text":"Excellent Guacamole, terrific Margueritas and delicious entrees.  Love Canting 1511"}
{"text":"Cantina, which serves upscale Mexican food with an interesting twist, is a great place to go for a nice date.   I so enjoy the chicken burrito - generously topped with a queso sauce - that I pretty much always get that.  My boyfriend really likes the Tacos Marco Polo (shrimp, bacon, and caramelized onion's in flour tortillas with pico de gallo and melted cheeses).   The margaritas are awesome. I'd recommend getting a pitcher for your table. While every table gets chips and two kinds of salsa, I'd also suggest ordering the guacamole. The water mixes up the fresh avocados and other ingredients right at your table.   Cantina isn't just a restaurant - it's an experience. Because it's so good, it's packed most nights. Call ahead and make a reservation or it could be a long wait."}
{"text":"Not a very good experience.  We went there to celebrate my daughter. Went with a couple that had a 5 month old baby.  When we got there it was not busy at all since it was about 515.  Our waitress wasn't bad, but our food took forever. It probably took over an hour. At that point in time the baby wasn't happy, we weren't hungry because we ate so many chips and salsa. The food wasn't bad, but wasn't great either. The manager did apologize and gave us this weird dessert that no one liked. The store was not busy at all, and we saw a lot of other people looking around for their food too.  Would not recommend to go go any later, if this was the case at 515."}
{"text":"Good job! We went to old one on East Blvd & it was horrible. Here, it was great! Live music, fresh food, great new decor, friendly staff. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We came here with a bunch a friends and had a real good time. Service was great as they were able to accommodate 8 of us with no problem.  The food was just as good. I had the shrimp skewer dinner which was really good and just what I expected. We also had 3 pinchers of margaritas too. Gotta have my margaritas lol.    No one in my group had any issues and we had an overall good time. This place is definitely recommended!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has it's pluses and minuses. With Yelp, we made reservations for 7:00 on the patio. We were seated within 10 minutes on a busy Saturday. The new location is much nicer, airier than the East Blvd. location. I really love the atmosphere and decor. Our waitress was pleasant. I ordered a house margarita which was sweet and not very strong. For dinner, I had the Marco Polo tacos. The tacos were excellent. However, the rice and refried beans were dry and bland. For atmosphere and service, I give it a 5. For food and drinks, I give it a 3.5. So I averaged it out to a 4."}
{"text":"Love this place! Service is always prompt. Food comes out quickly. Quality of food is excellent. I've been to Cantina multiple times and will continue to go.   The atmosphere of this restaurant is warm and enjoyable.   Prices keep me from rating it five stars, however, the food is worth the price."}
{"text":"My wife & I met some friends here for dinner tonight & we've been to this location a handful of times.   I was expecting a wait, given the weekend & this place is usually packed. The couple we were meeting got there before us & had already put in for the table. We waited around 35-40 minutes or so & were then sat. That's typical...  We sat at our table for around 20 minutes before anyone even came by our table. Once the waiter did reach our table we were greeted with a hyped up waiter who spoke so fast you couldn't understand what he was saying & he kept using douchey phrases like \"chip situation\", \"hydration station\" & so on.   We waited an additional 15 min to place our order & shortly after receiving our drinks, the food arrived. Luckily it was on point, with one exception. One of our friends ordered the small order of nachos, but got the large order & was assured she wouldn't be charged for the large order... She was.   Sparse drink refills, and persistent asking for more water was met with lackluster service & more douchey word play. The waiter nearly hit one of our friends with the water pitcher. Once or twice, it's cute & all... But this was over the top. We got a beer we didn't order, and was told it was a \"gift\" to go along with our other beers. I digress.   So to sum it up: the food was great as usual, but I'm not sure it's worth the wait & the poor service. We'll probably be back at some point, but likely for take out."}
{"text":"We just moved here from Arizona and popped in here last Saturday.  We were greeted nicely at the bar. But when my friend asked the bartender if they served tamales... And she said no, \"but we have jalapeños\"... We should have known better and left.  We both ordered fajitas... And for $17 per person... It was a pretty sad entree.  Plus no rice or beans or sides for that price?  Disappointing.  Decent margaritas though."}
{"text":"I waited over 45 minutes for a takeout order! How is this possible. First of all, I was warned it would be 20-25 minutes, which is bad enough. Then when I arrived, I had to sit and wait another 20. That's inexcusable. I could have just eaten at the restaurant and probably gotten my food sooner."}
{"text":"Excellent, the flavors were fantastic.  I got the chicken milanese, which i would get again next time I am here.  There is little parking, they had valet when we went."}
{"text":"I've been to this location three times. The two last times I went I ordered tacos. They are OK. I ordered the Pollo and the Baja Fish Taco. I just felt like they were a little lack luster. The Pollo came with chicken, avocado, pico de gallo, lettuce and chipotle crema. The Baja Fish Taco came with grilled fish, cabbage, lime, onions, and a mango sauce. I thought the mango sauce was too sweet.   The chips and salsa at the beginning of the meal were nice - again, nothing to write home about.   Service the first two times I was there was efficient and kind. Today we went for a work lunch. We had a reservation, but waited a few minutes. When we were finally seated, the chips and salsa were already on the table waiting. We were all really excited by that because we were hungry. The waitress, who was very sweet, stopped by and asked if we were ready for our drink orders. We had already looked through the menu so we were ready to order too. We all ordered from the special lunch menu. I got the Chicken Tostado Salad. Our drinks came about 5 minutes after we ordered them, I had ordered an iced tea - it never came. Then it took about 25-30 minutes to get our food. That was pretty excessive considering all the people at lunch (5 in total) ordered salads.   The salad it's self was really nice. The crunchy tortilla wasn't dredged in oil. The salad was fresh and the chicken was really well seasoned and cooked. I asked for the dressing on the side and it came on the side (you wouldn't believe how often I ask for it on the side and it comes dressed!) and the dressing was actually really good.   This is a nice option for work lunches as the location is large and room and not too loud, but considering how long it took to get food would make me consider other options for lunch if I'm in a time crunch."}
{"text":"We ate here on a Sunday evening and it was overall great experience.  We were seated instantly --though it wasn't busy at all, and the staffs were very efficient.  Seconds after we had been seated we were brought chips and salsa and drink orders were being taken.  The meal itself was also brought out very quickly.  I ordered their chicken fajitas and we ordered a side of con queso cheese.  The cheese was very good, though it was served a bit cold, and the fajitas were excellent.  The fajitas were served with lettuce, guacamole, tomatoes, cheese and picked onions --which were interesting but very good!  The fajitas were served on a traditional sizzling cast-iron pan and were absolutely wonderful.  That consisted of onions, peppers, chicken --the standard fajita plate.  My wife ordered a chicken burrito and was quite surprised when it was put on the table --it would have been difficult to fit this thing through the Channel Tunnel in Europe!  The burrito was gigantic --and very tasty, too!  Overall this was a great experience and we really enjoyed the food.  The service was second to none --though the restaurant was pretty slow.  I felt the food was a bit pricy; however, the service and great taste offset that and therefore I felt the price could be justified.  I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner and we could not have had a better server!!!!  We were initially seated outside and were a little uncomfortable.  Lauren F.  Was able to secure us a seat at the bar area where we enjoyed delicious fajitas and cocktails!!!!"}
{"text":"Where is the good old Cantina 1511?! Bad location! Slow service, bad ambience.. Few years ago it was my favorite Mexican restaurant, not anymore!"}
{"text":"Place is ok. Margaritas are good and chips are ok. You can tell this is not an authentically owned Mexican restaurant. Food is ok at best."}
{"text":"Mex restaurant so why Cuban music the entire time? Only good food was the chips and salsa and chicken tingas, carne asada sucked. Service slow and horrible."}
{"text":"Great food and service! This was our first first to the East Blvd location and we were impressed. I ordered the enchiladas de pollo and the wife ordered steak quesadillas. Both were great with bold flavor. The rice and beans were some of the best I have had; I was impressed from the first bite.   Service was friendly, quick, and knowledgeable. A new glass of Coke was dropped off every time I was halfway through the previous.   Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Spectacular service. Let me just tell you that this experience was so great that I signed up to Yelp just to write this review. Heather was our server and it was truly delightful; Carrie the manager also stopped by and was quite engaging-recommending fun things to do as we came in from out of town.  You must eat here!"}
{"text":"Although I have only lived in Charlotte for 5 months, I have visited Cantina 1511 three times. I was initally drawn in by the promise of half priced pitchers of margaritas but the food was so incredible and the service so nice that I have returned twice just to keep sampling the vast menu.   This past week I met up with two girlfriends for some great food and a little chitchat. The chips and two kinds of salsa that appear on the table could almost sustain me for the evening but I knew there were entrees calling my name. I have celiac disease so I need to avoid gluten and sometimes that can be a problem when I eat out. However, when I asked the server to point me toward menu items made with corn tortillas she immediately asked, do you not eat gluten? I was impressed. She showed me what items are n ormally made with corn tortillas but then told me that I could order any quesadilla with corn instead of flour tortillas and said she would check with the kitchen for anything else I might be interested in. How nice!  I ended up splitting the Enchiladas de Dennis with my friend. The waitress said they were one of the most popular menu items. They were so delicious. Corn tortillas stuffed with chicken and spinach and cheeses. Yummy! We all enjoyed dinner and I cannot wait to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant yesterday afternoon with some out of town guests who were in the mood for a margarita.  Having eaten at this location another time and experienced bad service I was not particularly excited, but hey, how can a margarita and some nachos go wrong?    We were promptly seated and a server came to take our order.  He disappeared, we assumed to enter our drink and nacho orders.  We were very shortly visited by another server who offered to take our order.  We explained our orders had been given.  The young lady said he was in training, and she disappeared as well.  We waited a bit, and we were served chips and salsa.  The bartender noticed that a nearby table had not been served and he asked them about their order.   The table explained that we were there first and to take our order.  The bartender took our order AGAIN.   Another 10 minute wait.  I believe another server came over to ask about our order.  Finally we received our drinks and had to ask again for our nachos.  Yet another server came over and explained they were \"short staffed\" which was odd because over all we had at least 7 different people come over to either take our order, ask about it, or apologize.    Finally we received our nachos and additional chips and salsa.  A person told us they were very sorry for the confusion and comped the nachos, which was very nice.  This restaurant has been open for years and should operate more smoothly than this, particularly with all the other FS restaurants in Charlotte.    I hear John Hancock's shiel/spiel about this restaurant, but he must live in an alternate universe."}
{"text":"Ask for Dustin!  He's amazing. Great flavors nice spice. We loved the Devil's Garden mixed drink. Try the habanero salsa and the fresh guacamole. Mole is for real. Sit in the patio. Fish taco is very good and not too filling. IPA with a lime was a hit with my table. Go!  Food is great!"}
{"text":"**I have to lower my rating on this joint...Since they've come under new owner/mgmt, they've fired some of their best staff, including Johan who brought them SO MUCH business (that won't be coming back, including me!). They've also upped their prices-granted the menu has changed, but add'l $3-$5 per entree?! Seriously?? I've been going to other spots(reviews to follow) that are less pricey and just as delicious, if not better.   I LOVE THEIR NACHOS!!! I should probably sample more of the food before writing a review, but who cares. Go for the nachos. The \"appetizer\" portion is enough to feed two people and have leftovers(unless you're some big ol hungryman type). Their mojitos and margeritas are the ish too.  Drinks in general are good, but catch a special, even if you have money to waste, a drink special tastes much better than regular priced booze anyday! Ask for Johan to be your server. My spicy, hot latin friend with the perfect teeth and best jiggalo accent you'll EVER here. He's awesome and the nicest guy ever. And who DOESN'T want to be served by someone beautiful that makes you think you're on vacation in S. America??(even straight guys and gay girls like me like it so ha!)"}
{"text":"Came here while in town for a weekend trip and my experience was great. The place is beautiful, service is good and food was delicious."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times, but tonight really inspired me to write a review.  A-MAZ-ING.  A friend and I visited, pretty late at night, and on a whim, decided to share one of the \"family style\" meals on the back flap of the menu.  We got the fish/seafood combination, which was three courses of seafood... the first was fried appetizers of shrimp, whitefish, zucchini, and calamari with delicious dipping sauces.  The second course was a paella with mussels, scallops, fish and shrimp, and dessert was a delicious tres leches cake.  WOW.  Everything was superb.  I love they offer local microbrews and the traditional Mexican favorites.  (Let's be honest, is there anything better than Negra Modelo or Dos Equis???)  I've been many times before, but can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Latest visit, we were seated outside with a pretty empty dining room and sat for 20 minutes while 4 different servers ignored us. Finally walked up to a waiter we saw and said we had been ignored, waited five more minutes and just walked out. Will probably not come back for a long time."}
{"text":"Service was good beer was good and food was OK A nice touch is that they bring you warm chips and salsa chips tasted homemade as well as salsa Plenty of TV 's to watch games Rodger the bartender was very good Prices are good for value  Will go back"}
{"text":"Literally only downloaded the yelp app so that I could rate them 5 stars. Best steak quesadilla I've ever had, nicest waitress, and an awesome environment. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  So does my wife.  Music can be a bit loud but who cares im here to eat...  My wife always get the guacamole and she loves it.  i love the queso fundido and basically anything else on the menu.  I HAVE NEVER HAD A BAD MEAL HERE."}
{"text":"Excellent tequila. Too bad they don't serve it the way they serve tequila in Mexico, with a shot of lemon juice and a shot of sangrita, along with the different salts. Good zucchini and cactus tacos. Great girl tending the bar!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing for a more upscale Mexican restaurant.  It's located in park road shopping center.  There is plenty of parking available.  Chips and salsa were tasty however, the queso dip was a disappointment.  How do you mess up melted cheese.  There was absolutely nothing great about the food.  It was so disappointing I can't even remember which kind of tacos I ordered.  The rice was inedible.    It is a large restaurant with plenty of outdoor seating on the front patio.  A great view of the parking lot ;)   I will not be returning to this restaurant.  There's tons of Mexican restaurants to choose from in Charlotte and this one does not make the cut."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices. Authentic Mexican food and Tex Mex. This is not a run of the mill mexican joint. The soup is a meal itself. Margaritas are smooth and yum. They have an excellent happy hour menu too."}
{"text":"To begin with, I don't understand Cantina 1511's apparent fetish for playing Mexican music at ear-bleeding sound levels. My wife and I were in one mid-week evening after the crowd had departed and were one of only a handful of tables occupied in the entire place. We literally could not hold a conversation sitting 90 degrees from one another at a square table. When we placed our order, we also asked that the music be turned down to a moderate level, and I swear our server was overjoyed to have an excuse to turn it down.  That said, the food was OK, not great. As transplanted Californians, perhaps our standard for \"great\" is a little higher than someone else's, but the food was serviceable. I just don't think it justified the prices charged. The brutal truth about Mexican food is that, for the staples (enchiladas, burritos, etc), the costs are minimal, the degree of difficulty in preparation is  minuscule, the time required to plate up an order shouldn't take 20-30 minutes, and it shouldn't cost $8 to $10.  That night, the service was rather prompt but other visits we have seen very slow service. And at all times, the damn music was just obnoxious.  I'd return, but only to sit outside, and not anytime soon. To those of you who love Cantina 1511, mazel tov. I'm happy for you. I know there is a better job being done in Charlotte, though."}
{"text":"No hostess when I walked in. Had to wait a few minutes to be greeted. Server was good! Name was Stan in case anyone wants to request him. Guacamole was VERY GOOD! Table side presentation and very fresh. The queso dip was Meh, ok. I ordered the Salmon. The fish itself was cooked perfectly but it was very oily and needed more sauce and goat cheese.  It came with roasted tomatoes which were very oily in my opinion.  The tres leches cake is NOT like a traditional Mexican dessert. There's a marshmallow spread on top which makes it very sweet and takes over the whole dish.  Service was good and the food was ok.  I give it a 3 stars for the creamy fresh guacamole and the salmon that was cooked just right, but that's about it."}
{"text":"We were visiting our son from out of town and had our dog with us. Bringfido.com suggested this restaurant and we had a delightful lunch and dinner on their porch. Great service from Brian and Dawn. Very good food and dog friendly!"}
{"text":"First of all, their chips and salsa is very good.  I am embarrassed to admit how much I actually ate.  Then came the chicken enchiladas (I forget the actual name).  They were also really good.  They came with a side of rice and beans (I just got rice because I don't like beans).  I actually wasn't a big fan of the rice, but between the enchiladas and the chips/salsa, who needs rice."}
{"text":"I had lunch and tried the guac, queso and enchiladas. First off for an uptown lunch, this place is a good deal. For 8.50 I got two large enchiladas packed with chicken and covered in a delicious mole. It came with a side of beans and rice, which were both good. Everything was really high quality. Guac was great and queso was delicious as was the salsa. Excellent service and a nice environment. So yeah, $8.50 for chips, salsa, and amazing enchiladas is a great deal."}
{"text":"This place is great. It's just a block from the Spectrum center so great for before a show or game and the atmosphere and food were top notch.  They seemed a little understaffed for the crowd but the managers kicked in to help the wait staff and kept things going. I had the pesto shrimp fajitas which were excellent!"}
{"text":"Beware....Cantina has a new owner and new menu and it's not great.  Sigh.  My husband and I used to looove Cantina; my husband would have eaten there every day if he could.    We visited this week and found out they had a new menu.  Nothing sounded amazing.  I ordered nachos that were only so so (how can nachos only be so so?).  In addition, the service was not as good as it used to be but our waitress could have just been having a bad day.  If you've eaten at Cantina prior to July 2012 and loved it, reset your expectations so you aren't as let down as we were.    (side note, pacos tacos is still owned FS Food Group and has the same menu; phew)"}
{"text":"So yummy! We always go here after the movies (free table side guacamole with movie stub)! I'm a fajita girl and theirs is pretty great with mushrooms and zucchini. The margarita sampler is a great value.. Three fairly large samples. I wish they hadn't gotten rid of the \"Twiggy\" margarita though.. Fresh lime juice and agave.. Yum!"}
{"text":"Sunday drink special: $2.50 draft beer (4 choices: Modelo Especial, Dos Equis Amber, Fat Tire, and something else). Good start to an okay meal. Fresh made chips and salsa to begin, awesome, but salsas (verde and roja) were too salty. Ordered the table side guac appetizer because it came highly recommended by my fellow yelpers, however, I wasn't super impressed. I'm pretty sure I can make better guac for much less than $9.   My date and I were feeling slightly crazy and wanted to order the family taco plate for the two of us (8-9 tacos), but the waitress talked us down from it. We each got the 3 taco plate (lots of tacos = more variety = more accurate review of restaurant?). He got the carnitas johnny, carne asada steak, and taquitos vegetarianos. I got 3 fish tacos (damn you self-imposed pescetarianism!). Fish tacos were just okay. Lightly breaded pieces of tilapia on a bed of cabbage, topped with diced tomatoes. The saving grace was the chipotle crema and \"Mexican hot sauce\" (tapatio? cholula?) mixture they had going on. My favorite was the taquitos vegetarianos, lots of flavor and veggies stuffed in a not-that-crispy taco shell (which was fine with me). I was told the carne asada was just meh and the carnitas johnny was good, however, after eating those two and then having a fish taco, the fish taco tasted completely bland.   Atmosphere was conducive to date night and decor was modern. Service was just okay, I'm thinking our waitress was new because she wasn't familiar with a couple of things, but she was nice enough. Although it felt like we were being rushed through our meal from the start.   We had a few things boxed up (couldn't finish our 6 tacos, fail) and someone in the kitchen threw away the left overs before they could be boxed, but they were nice enough to make new tacos for us. Score, more tacos for later!   Overall, I would return to try other dishes, but will know to specify less salt.   My quest for a good fish taco in Charlotte continues..."}
{"text":"This is our go-to Mexican restaurant.  The menu is a great blend of traditional and unique flavors, and is consistently good.  The made-at-your table guacamole is not to be missed, and the servers are friendly and knowledgeable about helping you make the best choice to your liking.  We have tried lunch, brunch, dinner, and catering, and have always been well pleased. This is a family-friendly establishment with both indoor and outdoor seating. There is a full bar, and margaritas to please just about any taste. Try the barbacoa and just about anything that includes avocado! Cantina 1511...yes, please!"}
{"text":"I have been to Cantina a few times and can day I have always had a really good experience. The food is awesome, service has been great and the ambiance is pretty cool for a chain restaurant. Will defiantly come back again. The brunch is surprisingly really great, check it out!"}
{"text":"Dinner and a show. I'm giving two stars bc the food was excellent, everything else was horrible. Our server was slow as in extremely slow and forgetful. We were seated in the lower middle portion of the restaurant, the elevate area behind us a had a large extremely loud party seated. While attempting to enjoy our meal we suddenly hear a group of females screaming only to have things escalate to the females engaging in a physical altercation. The large group was suddenly directly next to our table with everyone screaming and cursing. During this physical altercation not a single employee of Cantina 1511 bothered to address this issue. There was a server who I believed to be the server of this large group in the area laughing during the altercation. One person from this large group walked out after the altercation but not before a bit more screaming directly next to our table. The large group minus one of the females involved in the altercation sat back down still yelling and acting in a disorderly manner. There were a few tables that had recently been seated got up and walked out at this point. Servers severs were standing at the reps between the upper and middle area laughing as these tables walked out. Never once did a manager or any staff member come by and apologize for the scene. Nor did they bother to address this extremely loud large group at anytime. Bc our meal was ruined by this large loud group we decided to stop eating and take our food home. We as well as the table next to us waited a good while for our server to appear to request to go boxes. We finally get our to go boxes only to wait another 10 minutes for him to resurface to request our check. It's possible this server is new and if that's the case same on Cantina 1511 for doing a better job of training. It's really too bad these events transpired tonight as we'd been planning to dine here for several months as we'd been given rave reviews of the food. The food based on our few bites so far has been fantastic. I totally understand Cantina 1511 isn't at fault for the behavior of their guest, what they are at fault for is 1) not requesting this group to leave the resturant, especially after they continued to be so loud other diners walked out. 2) for addressing this altercation with each individual table in the same area as the altercation. It's doubtful we will return to dine again bc of the above reasons."}
{"text":"I've actually been to the one on Rea Road, which doesn't seem to be listed on Yelp.  I remember this restaurant because the food was amazing! The server was extremely helpful with what he recommended, because I ordered exactly both recommendations for the appetizer and entree. They were both great. The appetizer was the Queso Fundido I think, which looked like a small pizza. Very cheesy. The entree was Barbacoa del Puerco, which was awesome. It came with tortillas where I could wrap shredded pork with other toppings such as beans, guacamole, rice, pico de gallo, cheeses, and lettuce.  YUM YUM YUM. Service was also excellent."}
{"text":"I went here for a girls night out. I was pretty surprised at how expensive it is. $15 for 3 tacos?!? Which might have been acceptable if the tacos had been exceptional. They were rather Bland and not very interesting at all. Big disappointment."}
{"text":"I'm not one to usually write a review, but in this case I must.  I'm a chef here in Charlotte and if this happened at my restaurant I'd go absolutely nuts.  We came here on July 4th as we were going to the movies in the same center.  First we had to wait 10 minutes to be sat.  Now this would not be a problem had it not been for the fact there where only 5 tables in there.  There were almost as many servers as customers so you kinda see my point here.  The person who said he was our server was to busy so someone else came to get our drink order. Again waited 10 minutes for them,. Next we placed our order and waited 20 minutes for our food.  Not unreasonable,but considering the amount of people there, kinda surprised.  My girlfriend is a little picky about thinks so when we go to a Mexican restaurant she always has the same thing, two cheese enchiladas with diced onion on top. I know everyone has there own version of things, and they claim to be authentic Mexican food, but NOT EVEN CLOSE.  The enchilada sauce looked and tasted like it was tomato based. It had similar flavors of enchilada sauce but that's were it stopped.  I had the steak chimichanga and it was a lot of fat on the steak.  At least for my taste.  When the manager came by to see why she didn't like it, he was very defensive and almost seemed rude about claiming, this is how we do it.  Well I get that but then how can you say your authentic Mexican if you do it your way.  In short I don't recommend this place and we will never come back.  It's a shame this doesn't have negative stars on it"}
{"text":"Not realizing that you cna make reservations we walked in and they said it was a 1hr 20 min wait so we sat at the bar which took less than 5 mins to find an empty table. If you go be sure to make a reservation or call ahead. I ordered the shredded pork dish and the other person ordered the shrimp taco. Both dishes were good and a lot, I ate maybe 1/2 of mine and so did the person I was with. The prices are good for the amount of food you get. It's the drinks that are pricey! We had ordered 2 of the margarita flight specials which we only liked 1 of the 3. I agree with Brett R.'s review, for $15 you're better off getting a full drink."}
{"text":"I am NOT an expert on Mexican food but here is what I love about this Cantina:  really homey dining area (with a pope table for parties!!), great deck to enjoy your food while overlooking East Blvd, fantastic quac and great portion sizes.  The quacamole here is second only to Loco Lime.  Always fresh and plentiful.  They make it right at your table and to fit your palate.  Excellent accompaniment to a Dos Equis lager.  I have had the steak fajitas, soft shell tacos, chopped salad...all excellent and reasonably priced!  The valet is the best option for parking since it gets jammed there on summer nights.  Love you Cantina!  :-D"}
{"text":"I have to say that I don't know much about Mexican food but I loooove Cantina! Only recently has their quac been pushed aside for the Number One position by Loco Lime. But it is still top notch. The fish taco appetizer is more than enough food for dinner! Great serving sizes no matter what you get. You can definitely split the fajitas since a single order is ginormous. The staff here is always super pleasant and helpful. I have been both to the Rea Road location and East and have to say quality and atmosphere and staff-friendliness is consistently excellent! Love the patio on East blvd location during the summer :-D"}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were top notch! I absolutely love when waiters refill my chip bowl crazy quickly and here they sure did. The salsa was perfect. Not too hot but not too mild either.   The tacos were just alright. I honestly feel like I could have made better at my house. The chicken wasn't super flavorful but cooked right so I can't complain too much.   They also serve cheerwine which I have come to love in this part of the country!   I don't think I'll go back, but if you go here I don't think you will leave terribly upset. Decent Mexican."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit at Cantina very much! Rachel was very pleasant! Great customer service."}
{"text":"I've been here many times over the past 5 years and have never had a bad meal. Service is always spot on. Great queso"}
{"text":"Steak fajitas as usual...but to go. I would recommend letting them know your tortilla preference and also to place the cheese in a container by itself. The Mexican rice was not that good; I would rather have regular white rice to go with my beans. There's curb side parking for to go orders which works out well when you don't want to park that far away. Overall the good was very tasty!"}
{"text":"Ive been to 1511 a few times before and had much better experiences. I will say that the service was fine, the guacamole is awesome as everyone says. I still hate paying 10 bucks for guac knowing the ingredients cost nearly nothing but hey what are you going to do?   My gripe on this trip comes in the form of a steak chimichanga. I love chimichangas and I had never had one from 1511, so I ventured to my comfort meal. What came to me was more like a burrito the size of a football. It was not fried, which is why I am calling it a burrito. When I cut into it all I saw was rice, corn and......peas? YES PEAS. There was hardly any steak in my chimichanga. I was very upset, so I only ate half then brought the rest home hoping it would be better the next day in the fridge. That was not the case.   I will be back to 1511, the gf and myself have enjoyed it many times but I will NEVER order from the tex-mex side again."}
{"text":"GREAT guacamole. We are guacamole snobs but this was some of the best I have ever had. Made table side. Margaritas not that great. Hot sauce was pretty good after we doctored it up with some Texas Pete hotter sauce. We like things spicy. We both ordered tacos. They have specialty tacos. I ordered the Thailand spicy shrimp and al pastor. You can mix and match. Very delicious.  I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I gave this place 4 start for their guacamole alone.  they make it to order at your table - Delicious!  The place is usually busy for lunch or dinner. The food is the americanized mexican but has some things  you would not expect.  Overall the food is prepared very well.  I have had the filet mignon tacos, grilled pork loin, tacos and burritos.    The place has a great bar and serves up some nice drinks.  It is a good place to meet friends and I have been with several large parties and the services has been spot on."}
{"text":"Definitely overpriced for what it is.  I've eaten here a few times and the first couple were pretty delicious (LOVING that queso fundido) but the last time was so salty, I couldn't even eat. I sucked down tea like I'd never had a drink in my life just trying to put some moisture back into my tongue. With the over-salting and the high prices, I'd much rather go to another Mexican restaurant where it feels more authentic and rich, and where the food seems more genuine and tastes tons better.  Just wish I could take that queso fundido with me...  I will also say that if you happen to wander in late (a big no-no for me, but sometimes things happen) they won't turn you away and they serve you with the same courteous and friendly behavior as if it were the middle of the day. So kudos for that."}
{"text":"Always love going to cantina for a great meal at a great price. Guacamole is the best and the quesadillas."}
{"text":"We actually had catering from this place, but it was great! Suiza enchiladas, black beans, rice, yum. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Food was really good.   I had the Big Burrito with Chicken and it was done really well.  The only drawback was the service.  Came during lunch and it just seemed lacking.  I eat out a lot and a little bit goes along way with me."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night in hopes of giving this place another try. The first time had to of been 10 years ago and it was awful. I made a reservation thinking it would be packed (wasn't). Our waiter was pretty impatient and wouldn't stick around to hear 3 people order. He showed us the drink menu but kept walking away before we could order. He snapped at my mom when she asked for a regular margarita instead of telling him the name of the one she wanted. He asked her to refer to the menu that he previously showed her. It was pretty rude and awkward. Her margarita ended up being straight sour mix and it the worst drink I've ever seen prepared (just graduated college and those bars make a better marg).... We kept getting baskets of chips that were only crumbs, which was frustrating. When we got our food it was a lot. The ingredients seemed fresh and well prepared. I wouldn't say it was anything special though. The price is pretty high for what it is. I probably wouldn't go back and from the looks of it they probably won't be there much longer. Next door had a lot more business. Poor service, expensive food. Do not recommend"}
{"text":"The guacamole is delicious. Also the guacamole is delicious. I don't know if I've mentioned it but the guacamole is delicious."}
{"text":"Great, fresh Mexican food! I would highly recommend getting the guacamole. They make it fresh at the table and it was very good. Their tacos are the perfect size and everything we tried was great. Our waitress worked really hard to provide good service even though she was very busy."}
{"text":"The Carna Asada burrito is out of this world! One of my favorite places and things to eat in Charlotte. Their house margarita is also good!"}
{"text":"This is a good place for a dinner date.  Cantina 1511 boasts a great atmosphere, eye-catching decor, and romantic lighting.  The menu is split into two sections: authentic Mexican dishes on one side and the Americanized entrees we're all used to on the other.  Their specialty is handmade guacamole made tableside with a mortar and pestle.  I usually avoid guacamole like the plague (mostly because of the appearance, if I'm honest) but I gotta admit, this stuff was very tasty!  If you're looking for a unique Mexican dining experience, give Cantina 1511 a visit!"}
{"text":"We've eaten there many times. Just had lunch there on Saturday. Sat outside. We decided to have Margaritas and a couple of us tried a Drag N Berry. Margaritas were very good. The Drag N Berry was very syrupy/heavy but had good flavors and was heavy on the alcohol. Would have rather had homemade lemonade with a shot of something but they were out of lemonade. Love their taco selection - great combinations. I had a puerco al pastor, that had pork and pineapple (yum) and another that was brisket cooked in red sauce. They have a couple of good Mexican beers on tap, and had $3 blue moons as the special. We had a very nice relaxed meal with an attentive waiter. Try it you'll like it!!"}
{"text":"It was above average which is always nice. I don't say this often but I would go again. The taste of the food was on point and were it needed to be."}
{"text":"Boy do I miss moms real authenic cooking now! The Cantina Chimichanga should have been taken home. It was too big and my dog was hungry.   Oh well I guess I will keep looking for the best place to have Mexican Food in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with 2 co-workers...food was excellent once again.  Lunch portions are sized really well.  I had the fish tacos lunch portion and was very satisfied with the amount of food.    Our server, Adrian, was very knowledgable and made some excellent suggestions on meal choices that proved to be on point.  Food came out well prepared and in a timely manner.    I would recommend anyone go there for lunch ASAP!"}
{"text":"First time at Cantina Stonecrest. NOT GOOD. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and asked for shredded chicken. Waiter said they don't have shredded chicken. Ok what???? How do you not have shredded chicken? You just shred the chicken....I'm not sure what the disconnect was. Waiter brought out my plate...no shredded chicken and no conversation about it. I made a smart comment and the waiter didn't say a word. We also had two people there celebrating birthdays....one of our guests asked when we got there to have someone come to sing happy birthday for two of our guests...never happened.   This place sucks, food sucked and WAY overpriced. The quesadilla that I got at Cantina was $14.95....it costs $5-6 at other mexican places and tastes so much better.   Will not return"}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to Charlotte and were looking for a new favorite Mexican Restaurant. This was not it. There was no al a cart menu and no chicken mole (two things we like to order/ off of.) While the prices were steep the food was ok. They were completely out of there house margarita by 7 pm which sucks Bc that's my favorite kind of drink and I hadn't anticipated the price of what they did have available (they still are not serving half their drink menu understandable they just opened.)  The staff was friendly but I was waiting for my drink to be refilled a couple times (not so good when your eating spicy food). The place was good but not for the price or the wait. I think my brother was right, the best Mexican restaurant is a shady one."}
{"text":"Terrific food here with our server Alicia tonight.  Always a pleasant place to come!  Great service!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible.  We walked in and the hostess was talking to two men in the bar area.  There isn't much of a waiting area and there were four of us so we steppedmout ofmthe way. A couple came into the restaurant and walked to the podium...the waitress seated them right away, before even talking to us!  We waited about 15 minutes to get a seat...and then were seated in the bar area.  My husband ordered a beer.  They didn't have it.  He selected a second beer.  They didn't have that one eother.  The food was pretty good.  But when the bill came, we were charged for the beer!  For the price of the food the service should be better.  I was shocked when the bill came."}
{"text":"Good ambiance..my fav place for mexican food. Awesome Margaritas!"}
{"text":"ROCKING guac they make at your table - so fresh. Waiter recommended a lighter, white con queso which was a $1 side - perfect. Caesar salad was delicious too. Marg flight was ok. In general a little too much sour mix but the blood orange math was the best for sure. Nice staff and overall I'd recommend --"}
{"text":"Great supreme nachos!  I was impressed with the amount of meat and things they piled on the nachos most places skimp on the toppings they don't. For my entree  I ordered the Mexican Pork BBQ which was solid nothing amazing but good.  I didn't eat alot of it because I was so full from the nachos.  You get all you can eat nachos and salsa with your meal."}
{"text":"My favorite is the El pastor and shrimp poboy tacos..  The guacamole is alway made with love and there salsa is great kick"}
{"text":"Don't love the new location and service is not as good as it once was.  Still good food, but it has a cheaper strip mall feel to it which keeps me from wanting to go.  I might make this a strictly take-out destination from here on out."}
{"text":"My first visit came here over the weekend.  I liked it....you underwhelmed with that statement?  Well, that's kinda how I felt about Cantina.  I like it, I really do but maybe my taste buds and palette isn't distinguished enough to discern between Mexican meals.  What I mean is, yeah it was fine and the fresh and all things good but I didn't come away from the place thinking OMG, I can't wait to get back.  One thing I will say is that I really like the upscale (compared to most Mexican joints) interiors.  So if I want to step it up a couple notches from some place like an Azteca, I'll visit Cantina.  But if I'm looking to just get down and grub on some Mexican cuisine I'd probably stick to the Azteca type faire."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for dinner and drinks with friends last night.  Upon entering the place I noticed the look and feel is almost identical to that of the one off East Blvd.  Not a bad thing.  Large bar area to the left was open and inviting and the service from the moment we stepped in was great.  I was a little off put by the fact that this night they had run out of steak and scallops but I suppose these things happen from time to time.  I got a Southwestern salad with chicken and wasn't dissapointed.  Also the gauc was very good, although at $9.50 a bit pricey.  Parking is a little crazy in Stonecrest as you might already know so be prepared to walk after parking."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food with authentic flavors here in Charlotte. I have ate here a few times now and I have to let everyone know how good this place is. Besides the food the margaritas are hands down made to perfection with a good selection to choose from even the specialty cocktails. Salsa nights are awesome on Saturday nights with free parking with validation."}
{"text":"We always leave Cantina happier than we arrived. We've sat at the bar for apps and margaritas or dinner on the patio. Tonight we had dinner in the dining room. The tostada appetizer was to die. I had the veggie enchiladas and my fiancé had a beef burrito. Delicious! Lucky for us we each had leftovers which we'll devour for lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"This place is the worst. Service is terrible. We sat at the bar for 20 minutes with no service. They were busy and the bartender was slammed. However, the manager walked the bar 3 times and didn't even ask if we needed drinks or wanted to order. Nothing! It's a joke.    This chips are always stale and the service ALWAYS STINKS!  Great location, great job on the up-fitting of the building but not ever stepping foot in this place.  Every time I give them another shot I'm disappointed!   Big let down.  Wish they were back on east when Eric worked the bar and Patrick was the manager. I went there like 3 times a week and ALways had excellent service regardless of how busy they were!"}
{"text":"Always enjoyed the food there and the service was great when it first opened. Unfortunately the lunch staff they have now cannot handle large parties. I waited tables and bar tended for years so i have patience and understand how demanding people can be when they have separate checks and want to get in and out , it can be quite frustrating. However we have a reservation for 10 it took 15 mins for them to seat us ( table was ready it wasn't that busy) it took another 20 Minutes to get waters . I said to the server \"feel free to take our orders whenever \" her response \"you'll have to wait a minute\" .. ok fine maybe she's busy .. 15 mins later she asks if we know what we want, by this time everyone has to order there food to go. She could have cared less she didn't even seem busy she was puttering around leaving a cake at a table she had already served and filling water. What could have made her money probably only made her $2 a person and i have never left less than $5 on anything no matter how small. I won't leave her name but her attitude sucked and i hope she's a little more in her game if she ever works a night shift. By cold food was sub par by the time i got back to the office. That's 15 people that won't me back and i used to really like that place . Oh well there are many more choices in the area."}
{"text":"Great house margaritas and excellent guacamole!"}
{"text":"Love their staff and specially their AMAZING QUESO! I could literally eat their tortillas and queso all day! We came in a few weeks back after the snow storm left us to walk to get food. As a younger couple, we didn't think to buy food in advance. Lol! Upon entering we were given a warm welcome and were served by an awesome guy! I want to say his name was hunter? Or Charles? He was an awesome server and gave us exceptional service! We were very happy when we walked home with full bellies and to go plates full of more chips and left overs! Thanks Hunter/Charles for being so nice to us! :)"}
{"text":"I love Cantina 1511!!!!  It is that plain and simple.    The margaritas are fantastic and fresh!  And the table-side made-to-order guacamole is AMAZING!  I could eat that and have a margarita and be done for the day.  Service is great and the atmosphere is very relaxing and inviting.    I say it's a definite \"Must-try\"!"}
{"text":"Maybe they were having an off night? Chips were not that great and the sauce on the enchiladas verdes was very different tasting. Love their guacamole though so I would give them another shot."}
{"text":"If  I wasn't obsessed with some of their food, I would have given up before now... But let's recount my last four visit- 1 Called in carry out - discovered at home food was wrong  2 Called in carry out - discovered at home food  was wrong. Called in and they remade food, requiring me to make trip back to restaurant.  3 Dined in - took nearly 40 minutes to get our food.  4 Called in carry out - again food was wrong. Caught it while I was there. I had to wait to get food remade. Kinda defeats the point of calling in an order."}
{"text":"I just ordered $25 worth of food for myself ($10 of it was queso). This is America--where we have the right to get chips with our queso. BUT apparently Cantina 1511 thinks otherwise. When I called to inquire about this absurd monstrosity of an issue, not only did the woman hang up on me without letting me speak to the manager, I now have no chips in which to enjoy this queso. Way to go, Cantina! I hope this review loses you many more customers seeing as your customer service skills suck.  P.S. Management needs to get a grip on what's happening in that place. First the menus show two different prices for the food and now this.  Rude."}
{"text":"The Good: - The 5-cheese appetizer was delicious. - Our server refilled out water and sweet teas without prompting. - The food arrived quickly.  The Bad: - The Chimichanga had corn inside (it wasn't listed on the menu). - The soup one party member ordered was not delivered as an appetizer as requested, but instead was delivered with the rest of the entrees. - The prices recently went up (December, 2014) which means that two taco's now cost $12 (previously, they were $10). That 20% price increase is seen across the menu."}
{"text":"This place is in park road shopping center. You can get a good parking space since there are several available. The staff are friendly and welcoming. The drinks here need some work. In coming here I stuck to the shots or basics that you know. If you steer away from known territory you will get your feelings and pockets hurt for wasting money. The baja taco has flavor and the chicken taco needs seasoning. Whether you have the nacho app ( I recommend) or the tacos it's good portions. The decor is fun vibrant and lively. They don't have regular events but they could look into that to liven the place up. Happy eating."}
{"text":"Was so hoping I would like this place.  Guacamole was delicious. Chips were thin and salty and delicious.   Shrimp taco w peanut glaze was delicious as was calamari taco.   Now the bad.  Waited 15 minutes for our beers to be brought to table. Our service was just not timely at alllllllllll.  My chicken burrito was all rice. If there was chicken it was not obvious at all  very disappointed. Burrito gets a 2.    Would not go back"}
{"text":"Awful. Bland flavored food. One member of our party had hair in her food. GROSS!!! Service didn't come with a smile. The manager who came over to apologize was nice. I will never go back."}
{"text":"This place was solid but not spectacular.  The menu is limited and combines some really weird things together.   However, the combinations turned out to be delicious .   The service was also very solid and far better than I am used to elsewhere.  I only have it 4 stars because of the menu options.  It took my girlfriend and I like 25 minutes to make a decision on what to order.   I would give this place a solid B+ and we would certainly consider it among our options in the future"}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots! Picked up lunch for the office yesterday. Chimichangas, nachos, enchiladas, fish tacos, fajitas and fresh guacamole!! Yumola! Thanks Cantina!! You made our day."}
{"text":"Very yummy queso dip!!! Fish taco were also very delicious. Service could have been better. Overall two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Viva Mexico!  start out with the customary and complimentary chips and salsa, I lovvee that the salsa has a nice kick to it!  Score 1!  ordered chicken and 1 Marco Polo shrimp tacos but these are definitely not your average.  The shrimps are a nice size and seasoned well, the toppings taste very fresh, crunchy bacon, jalapeno, some delicious aioli sauce, say it with me YUM!.  The Ancho Pollo chicken taco wasn't too shabby either.  The taco comes with one side, I like the rice and black beans which comes in a small cup.  For libations, I ordered the Orange Tijuana Taxi, yes, yes and yes to this cocktail!  Finished off with the banging tres leche cake, notice I didn't say slice because the cake is enough to be shared with 3 ppl and it was delicious.  Parking is valet so need to worry about looking for a spot when you get here.  Just bring your appetite and enjoy"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been to the park rd location as the Ballantyne location is closer to me. The atmosphere at Park road is by far better than Ballantyne but that's about it.   We had a large party, and since they didn't take reservations until after 830 we pushed back when we were planning on eating until 830 to ensure seats and good service with such a large group. This was not the case.  At least we had a table right away but the service was terrible.  It took almost 30 minutes after our drink orders were placed for our first drinks to arrive.  They were just passed down the table for us to pick which one we thought we ordered.   After being there for an hour we had to flag down the waitress to ask if we could order food, she said she was waiting for us to get settled. We'd been there for an hour. We were settled.  Food was good per usual (except they \"ran out\" of the one thing I wanted), and came out in a decently timely manner especially compared to the speed of the drinks. Waters weren't refilled unless asked, and never once were we checked on unless we flagged down the waitress.  I'm a pretty patient person and I understand we were a big party and things get busy. But the rest of the restaurant was pretty empty (especially after an hour into being there), there were tons of empty tables, and plenty of other employees standing around literally doing nothing, or giving back rubs to each other standing behind our table.  I felt like someone should have stepped in to help out since there were plenty of people around to do it.   Food, drinks, and company were good.  I think I'll stick to the Ballantyne location from now on!"}
{"text":"Did a family style dinner for a wedding rehearsal. Not well designed but had a good time. Wait staff seemed a bit over whelmed. Will need to try a regular dinner to judge better."}
{"text":"Last week was my second visit to Cantina 1511. This time I sat at the bar and the experience was particularly good. I was quickly greeted by one of the bartenders who offered water and the wine list. I then had a pleasant time drinking some Chardonnay and eating some chips and salsa while perusing the menu. My goal was to eventually take out my dinner so my goal was to determine what would travel well. The two bartenders \"tag-teamed\" and so I was well taken care of. When asked about the different between the tortilla soup and the pozole verde the bartender offered me a sample of the soup. Nice. I chose the tortilla soup and a \"small\" chopped salad (was plenty.) I'll have to say that the tortilla soup is exceptionally good plus they packed the tortilla strips and cheese in a separate container so I could add them when I got home.  Well done Cantina 1511."}
{"text":"Had quite a poor experience at this newest location over the weekend.  We stopped in after church on Sunday to grab lunch before a show, should have had plenty of time.  There were only around four seated tables in the place, yet it still took 10 minutes for us to be seated.  The service was passable, but 35 minutes after we ordered we still had no food.  The waitress eventually came over, apologized, and told us the kitchen was short staffed, and to expect our food in five minutes.  Ten minutes later, and sans lunch, I went to the bar and asked to speak to the manager.  The bartender told me the manager was in the kitchen and went back to what he was doing, so I again asked to speak to the manager.  He actually sneered at me in response, and then huffed off to get her.  In her defense, she handled it well.  She owned up to the fact she had no real excuse, the restaurant wasn't functioning up to par, and she was doing what she could.  She was clearly flustered and doing her best, but I got the impression that the staff was not exactly up to the task of handling the now seven seated tables in the place.  She comped our meal without me asking and apologized profusely.  I couldn't have asked her to do more, but it is a bit disappointing that a restaurant with 3 local locations cannot staff their newest offering with staff that knows how to provide solid service.  By the time our food arrived, we had to bolt it down to make the theater.   As I told her- they are lucky I know and like the concept, otherwise I'd have not considered returning.  Hope this place gets it's act together.  I'll consider giving them another shot under the right circumstances, but it's in a place with a ton of other good choices so it's not like I'll be seeking them out."}
{"text":"Margs were great. Service was not. Will give it another try once they work the kinks out"}
{"text":"Normally this restaurant is fine - good food, good customer service, etc. No complaints. However, after last night, I am NEVER eating at Cantina 1511 ever again. Consider this review a public service announcement: do not go to this restaurant if you a) have any nut allergies or b) care about customer service at all.  Last night my friend, who is very allergic to nuts, went to Cantina for dinner and ordered the enchiladas. She ate her entire meal before realizing she didn't feel well. Her throat started itching and her lips swelled up as if she were having an allergic reaction. She called the waiter over and asked if the enchiladas contained nuts and the waiter said he didn't think so, he thought the only dishes with nuts were the desserts, but he would ask the chef to be sure. After asking the chef, the waiter informed my friend that the only dishes with nuts were indeed the desserts and a couple of salads, but that both were prepared on the opposite side of the kitchen from where her dish was prepared. My friend was fairly certain she was having an allergic reaction, though, so the manager was called over. The manager then told her that the enchilada sauce contains nuts and that it was her responsibility to ask if the dish has nuts. That is simply ridiculous. What Mexican dish has nuts?? And if one does, it should be stated on the menu! Also, even if my friend had asked the waiter if the dish contained nuts, neither he nor the chef would have known the answer! Lastly, all else aside, the customer is always right. It is absurd for the management to blame my friend for something that was definitely the restaurant's fault. The situation could have been exponentially worse and Cantina could have faced a serious lawsuit. I am thoroughly disappointed with the way management handled this situation (he made her pay for the meal and basically berated her experience) and it goes without saying that I will never return to Cantina 1511.     UPDATED: An employee from Cantina responded to this review and was extremely courteous and apologetic. He expressed genuine concern and assured me that management would be notified. He also promised this would never happen again. While I hate the situation happened, I am thoroughly grateful for the restaurant's response. Thank you Cantina!! Maybe I'll be back after all :)"}
{"text":"Service is great and staff really helps you pick the right entree .. love it  If you can ask for Chris please do. She was amazing!"}
{"text":"Yeah... No....  the only good thing about it were drinks. Mexican food? I don't think so."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! We ordered the Enchiladas Verde and the Fish tacos.Both were very good.  We started with the complimentary chips and salsa, and the salsa was very fresh and delicious. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time here and I'll be back! I loved my salmon salad. The guacamole with bacon was everything, made right at your table."}
{"text":"Excellent, just plain excellent.  Showed up with reservations with a large group (8) on a Thursday night.  We were on a mission that night and had been sampling food all over Charlotte, and Cantina was the last stop.  We ordered the tableside Guacamole which was to die for.  Our server whipped it right up and it tasted perfect.  One thing however, we ordered 2 tableside guacamole's and they only prepared 1 tableside.  The other was just brought to us from the kitchen.  Not sure what's up with that.  The Barbacoa was a crowd favorite, I have had this at the other location and it has been on point every time.  Duck Taco's, again a work of art.  3 on a plate and they did not disappoint.  I would highly recommend any of these dishes.  Cantina is Tex Mex at it's finest.  Great location, great service, great food......roll credits."}
{"text":"To be fair, I wrote an e-mail to the General Manager first, and he didn't respond after over a week so here's my update.  Went for lunch a week and a half ago, it was for my daughters birthday lunch and she loves Cantina 1511 as does my whole family.    The restaurant had a large number of flies, so much so that they impeded my families enjoyment of their lunch.  The flies were pretty bad during the chips and salsa stage but got worse when the meal arrived.  They asked to be moved and they were accommodated.  Once they moved a Manager (female) came over and offered a lame explanation about it being summer and flies are to be expected.      They finally left after paying for their meal which couldn't be eaten because they were pretty disgusted because of the fly issue.  It was a slow lunch day and not many people were in the restaurant.  They left after splitting the bill with the other party, the bill was around $60.00 ($28.22 which was half the bill).     Normally we like the restaurant and my wife who isn't a complainer her opinion is that she doesn't want to go back, which, I'm sure isn't what they want to hear  My kids didn't want to eat the food they boxed up and brought home because of the memories of the flies.  My wife has worked in restaurants for many years and I am in the commercial food industry, and we know there are sprays out there that can eliminate flies.  The managers explanation simply doesn't cut it and it sounds like she needs some retraining on how to respond to customer issues."}
{"text":"I LOVE CANTINA 1511. I could shout it from the hilltops, like Julie Andrews in the Sound of Music. Seriously, folks do-re-mi favorite restaurant in Charlotte, hands down.  The decor is Mexi-sexy, with low lighting, booths and tables both, and a great outdoor patio. The bar area is small, but cozy and always well stocked with local and imported beers.  The service = outstanding. Over the years I've been going, I have never had anything less than stellar service. I am one who is a stickler for good service (great food can be made OK when the waiter is a jerk), and this place gets 6 stars in that department.  Foodwise, I've never had anything that didn't make me say \"Oh my god, try this!\" to whoever my lucky date was. A good mix of texmex and authentic, I oftentimes get the 3 tacos with rice and beans. Now I am not ussually a taco person, but their taco options make it near impossible to resist: a chicken taco with pineapple salsa, taco al pastor with pork and greenchiles/habeneros salsa, a vegetarian hard taco smothered in red sauce with a medely of perfectly cooked vegetables inside that makes you wonder why you ever need to eat meat again, and a carne asada taco with onions that is so good you want to high five a cow.   Other hits include the pork entree (slow cooked in spices, falls off the bone, right into my mouth, mmmm), salmon (best salmon of MY LIFE), and the Nutella pie dessert. That dessert.... just try it. It will be one of the best decisions of your life besides having sex, getting married, having kids and buying that winning lotterry ticket.   Can you tell I love this place? If you're looking to go out with friends, a date, your mom or your parole officier, look no further. Cantina has something for everyone, with unmatched quality and superior service."}
{"text":"Great service. Really friendly staff. Food is usually great. Great guacamole. Food came out really fast and very kid friendly!"}
{"text":"Wow. What a sad situation. We came here once before and had such great service. Sadly we chose to come back today and decided to sit at the bar. 3 pm on a Saturday and there are a total of 8 people at the bar.   Service is atrocious. The woman behind the bar could not be bothered to serve the clients as she was too busy ignoring us and cleaning glassware. We ordered the guacamole at $9 a pop and had to ask repeatedly for chips. Our beer glasses were empty for 10 minutes and she finally asked if we wanted more beer. By now I only want water and my damn check. Too bad cuz I thought I found a great local place to go. Better keep looking."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for Mexican in the city. I'm so glad they moved into their Park Rd. location because parking is so much easier. My only suggestion would be to make a reservation if you're going at a popular time. My favorite dishes are the chimichangas, enchiladas and their fish tacos. LOVE the salsa!"}
{"text":"Incredible!! Took some visiting family there last weekend and had a fantastic experience! The food and the service was outstanding! I had the chicken torta (sandwich), family had the chimichanga and we also had the guacamole they make at the table. Everything was simply fantastic!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place more, but it lacks the casual, laid-back atmosphere of most Tex-Mex joints, and the food doesn't warrant the higher price tab. We took our kids and I felt a little out of place in the slightly upscale setting. Might be nice for a date night, though. The tacos were terrific and margaritas first-rate, but you can enjoy pretty much the same meal at Paco's Tacos or Maverick Rock for a good bit less."}
{"text":"Food is good but service way too slow. Ordered queso and guacamole, and waited for at least half an hour. Entrée took even more time, no wonder. Besides the slow service, food is good and comes in large portion. I ordered the three tacos for $15 combo. Each one was large. Their refried beans are really good, strongly recommend."}
{"text":"Taco Bell is better. Taco fell apart. Had to eat without shell. No seasoning on beans and rice. Would not recommend"}
{"text":"Great way to spend a Monday evening. Free comedy show. Good food, kind service and nice crowd. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been here on two separate occasions and I can say that I'm pleased with the food for the most part the service is blah just because they are usually pretty busy but the food is great I love the pork tacos they're street corn is great."}
{"text":"Overall the place, was pretty good! I had ordered the steak and chicken fajitas, which were very delicious! The steak was cooked just the way I had asked for, which I appreciated a ton! My margarita was also very tasty, my boyfriend asked for spicy margarita, which they don't have on the menu but they made anyways for him so that was a plus! My only complaint about the restaurant was the server was very slow when it came to bringing over check, she disappeared for probably 15/20 minutes, and it seemed like it was her first time serving.. Other than that I truly enjoyed the Cantina and would recommend for the food and margaritas!!"}
{"text":"Wow...what a difference can make after a few visits.    My GF and I were dying for some frozen margaritas and 1511 came to mind..we don't go anywhere else, but their machine broken down a few weeks ago, so we waited till it got replaced.  We arrived very early on Friday and was seated outside and proceeded to order drinks...this time it was just going to be drinks.  So the first order arrives and my GF finds a tiny Ant in her drink...very easy to do as the drink itself it practically white.  My drink is okay..  The next rounds she finds ANOTHER SMALL Ant...we still don't say anything, but this time I search my drink and what do you know...I TOO have a small Ant in mine.  We tell the server, which takes the drink back and replaces it.  Just for giggles I search again in my new drink...another one shows up?  By now the server is frustrated and replaces the drink again.   The manager also comes out and apologized, but we tell them there must be a bunch that got into the machine when they got it.  The bartender asks the server if we have Ants on the table..........THAT FOLKS is the first warning signs of trouble for a customer....They aren't worried if we are upset...but whether we are making it up or trying to rip them off???????  Now we have 1 more round, plus I have another...we find one more Ant...a total of 7 drinks and 4 of those had Ants.  (a photo is included of one of the little rascals)  We aren't upset, just feel bad for the server and barstaff, but when the bill comes, only 2 drinks are written off????/  I mean really, you would have thought the top end mexican restaurant would have been all over this as it is a health code problem...but no, they just wrote off a sub set and sent us on our way.....hmmm....well off with 2 stars for that one.  Not that we wanted a free ticket, but I really felt like management dropped the ball.    Can you imagine for a moment if the guy from \"Hells Kitchen\" had been part of that event.....what hell he would have raised at the manager and servers....how much grief and swearing he would have done to those folks for acting they way they did...really, seriously...they need a wake up call..........OR......this is bigger problem than customers realize, hence the lack of concern?????????????  Hmmmm....something to think about when you are thinking about dining or drinking with these folks."}
{"text":"This placed moved from Dliworth to Park Rd and I'm not sure what happened in the process but it is not the same restaurant it once was. Everything we ordered was average. Honestly, if I didn't know better I would think I was at On the Border. It was like I was eating Mexican cafeteria food. Try Bakersfield or Sabore if you're wanting a South of the Border vibe. Babalu is pretty good too. Cantina needs to step it back up."}
{"text":"Was pretty good I thought. This is a slightly more upscale Mexican place so they fancy things up a bit and charge more for it. The chicken enchiladas with a creamy sauce on them I had were good and reasonably priced. The beans were good, rice sorta blah. I also had a  Los 1511 Margarita which was very good and had lots of fresh lime but it was not $12 good in a 10 ounce glass. To start with I had the table side made guacamole which was excellent and a decent serving size. I would go here again."}
{"text":"Totally amazed by Cantina 1511. Not just with the food (which is always delicious) but the customer service is incredible. Yesterday we ordered fajitas to-go. Almost all the way home, we received a call from them telling us they had forgotten to give us the fajita wraps. Being rush hour, we decided to just stop by the grocery store rather than drive all the way back. Instead, they insisted on driving to our house and bringing us the wraps!! Who does that?? That's incredible. Not only did we get our wraps but a free dessert as well. Top notch service.  Thank you guys at East Blvd. Cantina and thank you Ally who took care of this for us. We were beyond impressed."}
{"text":"I haven't been to the new location until today and it's beautiful. The bar has two huge tvs and very comfortable stools. It's surrounded by a ton of high top tables half of which have those same comfortable stools. Have I mentioned how comfortable they are yet?  The service was impeccable. Drinks remained full as did the chips and salsa. The cheese dip is amazing and came out piping hot on with a candle to keep it that way. Our meals came out in the perfect amount of time to allow us to enjoy our appetizer. Our waitress was very attentive and never made us feel rushed.  If your in the area be sure to stop in and ask for Megan. She will take very good care of you."}
{"text":"Great chips & salsa and the guacamole was fantastic!  Service was great and attentive.   A good experience overall."}
{"text":"Group fun at Cantina.... OH YEA... we got the fish bowl room!  Just be careful you don't run into the awkwardly placed glass partition.  Dinner was wicked good!  I had the veggie something or nother... Tasted fried, so I'm good!  Everyone at the table (8 or us) was pleased with everything that they ordered.  The waitress was very attentive even though our group seemed to have overwhelmed her a wee bit!  I do like this place a good bit, so if you're looking for a great lil mexican restaurant then definitely check it out.  I've never heard of anyone having a bad experience there!  Check out the Dragonberry cocktail!  It's spectacular!    Make reservations, they book up quick!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation and walked right in and didn't have to wait. The marinated shrimp with plantains and black beans were awesome. I had cool waitress that gave me a sample of a local jalapeno beer they have on draft. I didn't like it but appreciated her offering to let me try it before I bought a full glass. The food/service is a level( or two) up from your typical Mexican restaurant (i.e Monterreys, Zapatas) Nice spot to take a date. I def.plan to return soon."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and both times have been delicious. The service is awesome, the food is crazy good and the atmosphere is fun. You can sit outside where it's a little quieter, by the bar or int he dining area!   They have great salsa, warm chips, guacamole and their portion sizes are HUGE! We love this place!!  The first time I went, I ordered the chopped salad with salmon. It had mixed salad greens, jicama, red onions, garbanzo beens, cucumber, cotija cheese, cucumber, and avocado with the dressing on the side.  The salad was perfection.  The second time I went I ordered the Western Cobb salad. It had chopped romaine, cucumbers, roasted corn, black bean salsa, jalapeno bacon, hand cut tortilla strips, avocado, cotija cheese and chipotle ranch on the side. It was amazing. They don't cut you short on the chicken. I don't think I've ever finished an entire salad at a restaurant. There wasn't a drop left."}
{"text":"For Sunday evening dinner, while in Charlotte, we took a break from southern cooking and chili dogs and such and decided to have some Mex.  It is always a crap shoot when you go to a new city and try to pick a decent Mexican place.  We read a few reviews and decided on Cantina 1511.  Well, we've had better and we've had worse.  Starting with the salsa which was amateurish loaded with cumin \"because that's what makes it Mexican\" (I heard a guy say that once).  The guacamole \"made\" at the table is kind of like semi-made at the table.  It is a large order, made with two avocados.  But the lime juice is pre-squeezed so the fragrant oils are lost completely.  The tomato and onion and cilantro are supplied by using some premixed pico with large onion hunks.  We don't want the hunks of raw onion so asked our server to leave the pico and we picked through it to have some tomato.  We also asked for more lime to add, since they did not add enough.  He brought us more, but again, pre-squeezed.   After sorting out enough tomato from the pico and adding more lime juice and salt, we made it OK to eat.  They really need to juice the limes with the little manual juicer at the table.  Ms T had fish tacos (they were fried, not grilled) and declared that they simply had no flavor.  They were made from the ubiquitous tilapia, (which normally tastes like dirt to me) floured in masa.  These did not taste like fish or dirt or masa.  Just fried stuff.  I ordered Tacos al Pastor.  This style of meat has become popular in the US in the last couple of years and it is rarely made right.  Cantina 1511 joins that club.  I really don't expect a trompo of seasoned pork that gets cut off with a large machete and grilled to crisp it a bit, like a good gyro.  But this was shredded pork stew, sweetened, too wet.  It is not supposed to be sweet.  I have eaten in the restaurant in Mexico City that claims (who knows if true) to have invented the style.  Cantina 1511's version is not even good by US standards.  The rice was the plastic pellet style, I guess made from converted or instant rice.  The black beans were pretty cuminy, not well seasoned.  It is a very nice place.  Jamal provided excellent service.  They are trying to be modern Mexican, but are not quite getting there.  I would keep looking for Mexican in Charlotte."}
{"text":"You know what, giving this restaurant 5 stars says a lot coming from me (like I'm some sort of food critic). But seriously, everything from the restaurant atmosphere to the prepared-in-front-of-you guacamole, I was in love.   Oh and did I mention when we first sat down we were told there were $4 Margaritas & Mojitos....and our very attentive waiter kept em coming....SOLD!  Did I mention that they make the guacamole fresh at your table and they'll add more/less spice as you prefer...SOLD!  Did I mention that the salsas (both the regular tomato and the lime salsa, OMG) and the chips were fresh and I couldn't get enough....SOLD!  All I have left to say is Shrimp Tacos....I need a damn cigarette now I don't even smoke...EXHALE!  And I'm no local, so don't worry about me \"juicing up\" these Charlotte restaurants...as you'll see in another review ;-)"}
{"text":"Great customer service.  Called to make reservation for future and told to call back another day because they are busy tonight  Manager followed up."}
{"text":"A little pricey but delicious!! We started off with the Street Food Platter ... so delish that right there is a meal in its self! Apparently the selections vary but I believe on that day we had the biggest calamari I have seen in my life, quesadillas, and some kind of meatballs which were pretty tasty. I had the Pan Seared Sea Scallops and Shrimp as my main course and it was delish ... but very salty. I love salt nom nom nom... but those scallops were like pretty much soaked in a vat of salt and then thrown into the pan . The shrimp was delish but the scallops thumbs down . My sister had the chicken tacos and she thought they were pretty tasty as well. We told the waiter it was my sisters birthday and he brought out a piece of a piece of the four milk cake ... obviously they didn't include chocolate milk in this cake so I didn't eat any, but my sister did she said it was alright. She may have enjoyed it more if we weren't so full off of the appetizer, margaritas and main course! Overall I really liked this place and would love to try it again!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give them a higher rating, but this was my third time trying the restaurant and still they just don't make the grade.  To start, it does not matter what time of day I have visited or how many tables were filled, it takes a minimum of 30 minutes to get your food. I even ordered everything as soon as the waiter came to my table and still, 35 minutes later my main course was served.   The cheese enchilada dinner if served in the iron skillet which is how most of their dishes are served taste like iron. It has absorbed the flavor of the metal and definitely does not taste good. When asked to have cheese enchiladas served on a plate, the cheese was cold and the portion was significantly smaller and again, lacked in flavor and taste.  Pros - great location, great chips and salsa and good drinks.  Cons - I have yet visit and be in and out in less than 45 minutes to an hour and a half. Two of three times I have visited the waitstaff has been new, did not know the menu and did not seem to be fully trained or engaged."}
{"text":"Visited for a date night evening.  Original plan was to go to Firebird.  However, Firebird had a two hour wait.  So we decided to venture to Cantina 1511.  We were pleasantly surprised that we could be seated within 30 minutes.  The atmosphere was inviting and the wait staff was delightful.  I ordered fish tacos and my wife ordered quesadillas.  The nacho chips were freshly made and seasoned to perfection.  I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone and we intend to visit again very soon."}
{"text":"I ordered the Baja tacos and other than the Taco Bell style hard shells they were quite good. I ordered one soft and one hard and the soft was definitely better and more authentic. Our waiter Ben was excellent. Attentive but not annoying. Regular Margarita was average. Music was oldies (80's) rock the whole time and a little on the loud side. We were on the patio which was really nice for being on a parking lot. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Delish Guacamole, wonderful margarita...This is a great lunch spot. I recommend Tahona Margarita is a must, it's a one and done type."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican spot in town. Yes, I realize it's more of a Mexican-fusion restaurant, but stick to the authentic Mexican items and you can get a killer meal for a reasonable price. Their chips and salsa are some of the best I've ever had and the barbacoa de puerco is my favorite."}
{"text":"Great place.  Wonderful service.  I have tried just about everything on the menu and have never been disappointed.  Some favorites are the Barbacoa, Steak Chimchanga, and the Guac!  Parking for lunch can be tough.  Don't park out back or you will either get booted or towed.  At night they do have valet parking.  Looking for a fun place to go, that won't let you down this is it."}
{"text":"Best upscale Mexican food in Charlotte by far.  They have two locations but this is the one we go to most often.  My favorite dish is the crap and avocado quesadilla.  Table-side guacamole is the best I may have ever had.  Nice outdoor seating and really kind and helpful wait staff.  Unique selection of drinks, try the pineapple margarita."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim without reading reviews or seeing the menu since the place we had originally picked was closed. So glad we did! Not only is this super convenient to our house, the food was wonderful! I had the al pastor marinated salmon and my lovely date had the steak fajitas. I'm going to back up a bit before I talk about how great the food was to tell you I ordered a margarita FLIGHT. What?! Who has that?! They do. And they're awesome. Back to the food.. the salmon and steak were cooked to perfection! The fajitas came with carrots as a side.... unusual? Maybe. But he said it was a game changer! If you have he opportunity to try this place, you definitely should!"}
{"text":"Cantina rocks.   You wouldn't know it from the way it looks outside, but Cantina serves up awesome food and even better drinks from south of the border. It's packed on weekends--usually with a somewhat younger, louder crowd, but it's by no means a fratty place--so make a reservation in advance and prepare to wait a little once you show up, but trust me: it's worth it.   Cantina has all you'd expect from a nicer Mexican restaurant, with a lot of the extras. You'll definitely want to order a top-shelf margarita--easily one of the best in Charlotte, if not the best. Try the Kiwi/Strawberry Special if you're up for a change; it's delicious. Good Mexican beers are on tap as well. Drink up. Everyone else is.   As for the food, I dont know where to begin or end. The chopped tostada salad is to die for if it's lighter fare you're craving. If you want some good 'ol refriend beans and pulled chicken, you won't be disappointed. My favorite? The Kobe beef fajitas. Trust me. Order this.   I'm definitely going back. What I wont do, however, is plan on having a big night afterward. The scene is fun and loud, but you're about as full and tired as you can be when the meal's over. Which is a good thing."}
{"text":"Was there celebrating my best friend birthday I had reservations.  We had an table on the patio there was live music which made the evening better that area is first come no reservations needed. The food was amazing and the service was great !! It was our first time I will be coming back !! I would like to go to the new park road location coming soon !!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. However we saw two mice during the course of our 1 hour lunch today. I question the \"A\" sanitation rating.  Not only did management or the sever not apologize, they didn't seem very concerned. Will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"I have to edit my previous 4 star review down to two stars... it was purchased from the group that owns Mama Ricotta's, Bad Daddy's, Paco's Taco's and Plate Perfect Catering by some guy named Richard Campbell. Since this change in hands, the food quality has dropped off a bit. It's still good, but not as good as it used to be and for the price you pay there, that's not a good thing. The one thing that bothers me most about this place and will probably cause us to seek out a new Mexican restaurant in our area is the fact they have a \"lunch\" menu that's really just a shortened version of their dinner menu with no break in price. There are no \"lunch specials\" like you'd find at any restaurant, but especially a Mexican restaurant. We have one more \"living social\" type coupon we're going to use up there and then we're done."}
{"text":"Always a great choice, one of my favorites and I'm rarely disappointed with the food or service. The atmosphere is lively and exciting, great full bar, and incredible cantina Mexican dishes. LOVE the salmon and the mango salsa - I want to buy it by the carton!  Only con: parking is consistently a terrible experience. The valet is fine and helpful but on busy nights it's tempting to just scurry off to another place and avoid the whole mess."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time celebrating my friend's birthday. The carne asada taco was delicious and the guacamole may be the best in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Thanks to all the Yelper's,  as we chose this restaurant for tonight's adventure.  You ask why I call it an adventure......because you never know the service that I am going to receive.  I started today's adventure via yelp, I investigated a few reviews, visited the website via yelp, and then placed my reservation online for 7pm.  Being that this was our first time here we arrived promptly at 6:54pm, we were greeted by three lovely young ladies at the hostess stand. We were seated immediately, in what I will refer to as the Tarzan room. (they must have known of my wild adventures in previous posts on yelp)  Our servers name was Ryan, he was very kind, polite, and efficient with his tasks of serving our needs of tex-mex food.  He asked if this was our first time in and of course, we replied yes. He was familiar with the specials and stated that if we needed any assistance with the choices he would be very willing to assist.  He allowed just enough time to look over the menu, and returned promptly to take our order.  Tonight's meal included 2 beef tacos, and the Mexican City Steak Fajitas. ( I have included a picture of my meal) Our drinks were Coke and water, he was very prompt with the refills.  The restaurant was very busy tonight, but the food was hot, fresh and very timely in it's arrival to our table. Unlike many of my other dining experiences, it is becoming less of an adventure and more of a tour of how a restaurant should be, efficient, and friendly.  The tortillas were very nice, fresh, crisp, and the salsa was very pleasant, not too hot, not too mild.  As momma bear says.....it was just right.  The music other Yelper's speak of was not much of a concern to us as we were in a separate room away from the main dining area. Our conversations were easily heard and was not too loud as others suggest.  When the meal came out, the portions were very reasonable, it was hot fresh, and very appealing.  My senses were blasting.  From the  sound of the fajitas, the smell of fresh cooked vegetables on a very hot skillet and the taste.....oh my it was delicious. ( It looks better than my photo as I did not want to use the flash)  The texture was very good, and I enjoyed the small side plate of fajita accessories which consisted of cheese, sour cream, lettuce, dices tomatoes, carrots, guac,  and onions. I needed more fajita bread, and our server had these delivered at no additional charge.  Based on this experience, I will provide 4 stars, it was less of an adventure, and more of an enjoyable night out.  Thanks Cantina 1511, for providing an easy and enjoyable meal, and for all you Yelper's who have not tried this place, go ahead, give 'em a try.  They have a beautiful patio, good food, nice atmosphere, and good service.  I may just have to use this experience as my gauge for 4 stars, I just can't see how tonight could have been much better.

{"text":"We've never had a bad meal here! The salsa is wonderful and so are the entrees. Make sure to get a margarita and the Nutella pie for dessert. If you haven't been here, make sure to put it at the top of your list!"}
{"text":"Wow! Just experienced the rudest waiter in bar area! Rude before I could even ask about a drink!  There were no seats and didnt like that I was standing near his customer.  He came to apologize a few minutes later, but again with attitude! No drink for us!asking me to move nicely would have been fine!"}
{"text":"We had a reservation at 7:30 for a party of 12 for a birthday party. We arrived at 7:20 and were told our tables were almost ready, that a previous party was finishing up at our table. Not a problem. 815 we were still waiting and the manager said she had an idea, she could place a table at the end of the booth, but it was going to be too cramped, then she suggested 2 booths, splitting up the party, which defeated the point of being all together for a birthday party. The manager was nice but the hostesses were very rude and snotty behind our backs as we waited to see if our original reserved tables were ready. We heard the hostesses bad mouthing our entire party, mainly the birthday girl, and were very upset with how they were talking about us with us right there. We addressed the situation to the same manager who was helping us and she apologized and said everyone was on edge because the owner was in that night. Really? I'd hate to see service on a night he wasn't there! About 830 we finally sat down at 2 different booths against what we wanted, but it was late and we were all hungry. You would think that with the problems this far service would be top notch, WRONG! We waited another 10-15 mins before our waitress even came to see what we wanted to drink, then took forever to receive waters, and a bucket of beer. We were right next to the bar, we would have had faster service walking up to the bar individually. We were promised free guacamole for our troubles with the RSVP but that too seemed like it would never come out. Our other table had a little better service then we did from another waiter. Our other table received their food before ours was even ordered, we finally got our food around 915-930, few orders wrong and the birthday girls food was nowhere to be found. Another manager walked by and we had had it at this point. We addressed the food and drink issues and how long we had been there, drinks and correct food came out very quickly after that. But before that our waitress came over and yelled at one in our party who's food came out wrong. She said it was his fault and she asked him 4 different times what he wanted, well why in the hell did it come out wrong then?! The nerve of her to yell at a customer! The original manager came over towards the end of dinner and told the birthday girl she hoped her night got better, laughed at us and walked away. Rudest service hands down. We did get some of our bill comped, but by then it didn't matter, food was cold, served wrong or not served at all, and all by the rudest wait staff in Charlotte. We will never attend Cantina again and plan on making a complaint with the owner and telling all of our experience."}
{"text":"Won't go back I got the shrimp fajitas (pretty simple right?) at lunch and for 30$ I got 6 shrimp and a huge pile of onions/peppers and other random veggies.....table-side guac was bland and tasteless"}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst Mexican restaurants I have ever been to I ordered the shrimp fajitas pretty simple right ? wrong!! $30 and I got maybe six rubbery shrimp on a bed of what looked like every vegetable in the refrigerator that they wanted to throw out along with the guacamole that wasn't good along with the salsa that tasted like it was nothing more then canned tomato sauce - needless to say I will not be back"}
{"text":"Aside from the delicious food, this place is BEYOND dog friendly! We showed up with our two pups and were greeted with custom 1511 dog bowls for water and bags of treats and toys that we can take home. Our dogs have already requested we come back."}
{"text":"Good food but pricey for Mexican food. Cantina gave me a free dessert for this review though so that was nice. Will be back."}
{"text":"I had been to Cantina 1511 once before and wasn't really impressed with that experience.  This experience was much better.    This time I sat at the bar about 1 1/2 hours before closing time.  I asked the bartender what they had in local beers - OMB's Copper on draft and Foothills Hoppyum in the bottle.  Ok.  This wasn't starting out well.  Do they know about the local craft beer craze?  Moving on, I don't remember what I had the last time I was here so I asked the bartender what she would suggest and it was a pork taco where you make your tacos with the  toppings provided on the plate.  I asked if i substitute crunchy corn shells instead of the flour tortillas and she said I could do that.  This was a wonderful recommendation.  The flavors from these tacos danced in my mouth.  Also the best place for the beans and rice were on the taco.  People who have read my reviews know I am not a big beans and rice person because they often lack in flavor but not here.   The salsa was great here as well.  Just the right amount of heat.  The chips could have been better.  It appeared they were from out of a bag because all I received were broken pieces.  But overall, this was a great experience."}
{"text":"Why didn't I think of this idea first? An upscale Mexican restaurant that's independently owned (they own Mama Ricotta's as well). This Mexican food will come with a price, but I promise you'll be very impressed with the taste.  They have some very unique Mexican dishes & you aren't going to see your ordinary Mexican menu items. They add their own flare to each dish & I'm not sure I've ever had a better enchilada dish than here. I'm not sure what sauce they use, but it sets it off. They also make the guacamole in front of you & they add a little spice to it as well. Once again, I don't think I've ever had better guacamole.  Cantina's food comes with a price, but it truly is worth it. This beats the upscale Mexican chains by a long shot. You'll leave this place impressed & wondering to yourself why you didn't think of this first."}
{"text":"We have been fans for a long time, especially at the old location.  However, last night and the last couple of visits have been extremely disappointing.  We are salad lovers, and the 1511 salad has always been our favorite, but not since the relocation.  Salad was bland and served with three slices of chicken (as ordered) but the chicken was overcooked and under seasoned.  Margarita seemed watered down.  The kids menu for our grandchildren was much better than our dinner.  I really hope they can bring this restaurant back to the wonderful restaurant it was before on East Blvd.  I miss it.  The chips and salsa are very good.  Service is very good, but the food, not so much!"}
{"text":"Lunch was awesome!  It's better than average for this type of cuisine.  Place was clean, fun, festive...the service was a complete 10!  Food was great, portions are more than enough, very fresh!  Easy parking.  I'll be back with more friends"}
{"text":"This is the cutest place ever.  I will start by saying the food,  awesome!!! .  I attended the place for a group luncheon for about 50 people.  The organization of service sucked and they seemed to be unprepared for the party.  Many people food, including mine, came out after most were finished eating (but the food was good). Besides the clueslessness of handling a large group, the place is cute and the food is so good.  The Guacamole is to die for."}
{"text":"06/21/10  I don't mind dining at a chain, as long as I (and others who may have joined me) leave feeling terrific about the experience.  Our party of four (three adults and a child) decided we'd try this place out, partly bec. of the glowing write-up it received in Charlotte magazine.  I was also excited about trying Mexican French toast, as written about in Charlotte magazine's \"Top 50 Breakfasts!\"    As we entered the resto, we immediately noticed the comely decor of a typical modern Tex-Mex venue, and as we sat down, I especially noted that the music was very loud.  (If you'd like to experience this yourself, first take care to find a nice quiet spot- enjoy the silence for a few seconds, if you'd like- before you turn your speaker volume to full-blast, then head over to Cantina 1511's website.  I dare you to let this go on for another 90 minutes.  I DARE YOU!)  As our server delivered our drink orders, (sis and I also asked for the margarita special of the day, which was made w/ Heradura tequila), our server asked if we needed more time, to which I replied, \"I already know I'm having the Mexican toast,\" after which the others said they needed more time.  After the others had a few more minutes to look at the menu while listening to the loud background music, our server returned and took our orders- shrimp torta for Mom, steak fajitas for sis, and the French toast for me.  No French toast, except for Sunday brunch you say?  Well, I'll have the crab and avocado quesadilla, minus the avocado, then.  (And why the heck did you not mention this when I stated my intention before?  Oh, yeah.  I forgot.  Maybe bec. you couldn't HEAR ME due to the crappy music that blared above us!!)  After a few minutes of trying to bat away a persistent fly, our chips and salsas arrived.  I took this time to ask the food presenter (not the server) to request if it was at all possible to lower the music's volume.  (Hey, it can't hurt to ask, right?)  The answer we received is that more than likely our request won't be granted, \"due to keeping up w/ the atmosphere, and all.\"  OK, well, would you please get rid of this pesty fly, then?\"  \"Haha, sorry, but no.\"  Looking back, we should've just stood up and left...  While I can't speak for the app myself due to a corn allergy, the general concensus was that it was A-OK.  The margarita, which sis at first turned her nose up to, was not bad after I stirred the beverage stick around a few times, which allowed the Heradura tequila and fresh juices to mix.  I'd asked if the drink could be made frozen, for future reference, but no.  (See a pattern here?)  As the tequila began to work its magic, sis noted that the music volume had come down a little.  Ole!  (However, the volume went back to its original strength a few minutes later.  Que mal!)  To make a \"mucho terrible\" story short, the food, w/ the exception of the fajitas and margarita, left us w/ much to desire.  Mom's shrimp torta was \"just another shrimp sandwich.\"  \"But what about the bolillo?,\" I asked.  \"Nothing special.\"  And this from a woman who LOVES the bolillos from our neighborhood grocery store!  Too bad, bec. the pics looked good, don't you agree?  (This seems like the case w/ the cuatro leches cake, as well, but I am getting ahead of myself.)  Nephew didn't even finish his taco, nor the fries (and how he loves fries!), and my crab quesadilla dish was just three charred triangles filled w/ too much cheese and lumps of crab here and there.  Despite my trimming off some of the cheese, I didn't even finish two!  We all pretty much concentrated on the steak fajitas, which, despite the fatty content of the meat, turned out pretty good.  (And thank goodness it did, for this pretty dish went for a pretty penny... 1600 pennies, to be exact!)    Hoping to end the meal w/ a postre (Spanish for dessert), I chose the Cuatro Leches cake, which promised four types of milk in the form of white chocolate meringue, dulce de leche crema (condensed and evaporated milks plus sugar) and the fourth?  I think there may have been white chocolate chunks, but don't quote me on it.  Two words: too sweet!  Take away the meringue topping, it's OK.  Nada especial!  Mom and sis didn't care for more than a bite, and bec. I didn't really have much to eat, I finished the dish anyway.  If you're going to try your luck w/ this dolce- skip the canned peach slices and ask for more stawberries!  Or, better yet, just pass on Cantina 1511 and look elsewhere.  Not only did I end up spending $70 on a lackluster meal, but I was in a foul mood for the rest of the day due to the blaring music, not to mention the disappointment in not having the Mexican toast (French toast w/ sweetened cream sauce).  Nowhere was it mentioned in the Charlotte magazine article, nor Cantina 1511's menu, that this selection is only available on Sundays.    Cantina 1511 is no bueno!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. Fantastic salsa, and really good tacos. (Why did they do away with the shrimp and scallop taco, though? IT WAS AMAZING!) Service can be a little hit-or-miss, but the food is consistently good. It's become our preferred Mexican restaurant in town."}
{"text":"Awful experience. Bar area smelled of damp dirty towels and bar top wasnt cleaned but sticky with old salsa. Gross"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is fresh, and the service is great! We love taking out of town guests to cantina to give them a taste of our local food scene."}
{"text":"Wife loves it so we keep coming back.  I'm never disappointed but never fully impressed either.  It helps its in a great location and we usually go before a movie date.  Service is typically just ok but they usually are busy so I'm sure that's why."}
{"text":"It was my first time in Cantina 1511! The decor was very bright, and vibrant. There was live music on a Thursday. The employees were dancing, smiling. Very fun vibe!!  When I got there, they gave me chips and salsa. I ordered the veggie burrito. It was very delicious, and grilled veggies in the burrito was really good. Everything was $10"}
{"text":"I would give them five stars, and the old location definitely deserves five. However the table setup at the new location is cramped, service is mediocre, and we wait longer for our food now."}
{"text":"**Park in the Hearst Tower & Cantina 1511 will validate your parking up to 2 hours**   The decor is beautiful!!!! It gives off a vibrant spring feel!!!! The patio seating provided a relaxed street view of the Uptown area. The Margarita was perfectly mixed -  light enough to enjoy the flavor without the strong kick from the Patron.   The duck taco (Pato Carnitas) was amazing ~ especially the kick of heat from the jalapeño & pickled onions. The shrimp taco (Tacos Gobernador) was very tasty. It's definitely a place that u must visit before it gets too hot outside."}
{"text":"First when you walk in the door, very friendly host staff. The cantina area is great for drinks and/or dinner, and the bartenders are friendly and accommodating as well. They make a great margarita and always have good beers on tap...happy hour is a blast! Nice place to unwind after work, lots of business people go there. Dining in the main floor is hit or miss though; food is good but wait staff needs to step it up...service is a little slow if it's filled up. Nice place for a group or family. Very kid friendly. I'd say a 7.5/10 experience combined-food, service, and cantina area."}
{"text":"This place was a much better option for Mexican food in comparison to Que Onda. However, it's still your typical American Mexican cuisine. I got the carne asada burrito and the steak was good. My coworkers and I shared the queso and let me tell you... we have no self control when it comes to chips and dips haha."}
{"text":"Always on the hunt for good Mexican food (sorry NYC has very little) brought me to this spot.   Service: Great. They were actually packed so we sat at the bar. Bartender was friendly, service was very fast.  Only complaint is the trashy guy next to us at the bar. The poor chick with him, at one point he says I bet not one woman in this place doesn't want to sleep w/m.  Me and his date both raised our hands.  Hahaa NC trash.    Apps: Great chips and salsa,  Spicy! Chicken tortilla soup -was fantastic!   Main: I had some kind of pulled pork plate, it was OK nothing I would ever order again -the pork was overcooked/burnt.  I asked the bartender what he liked and he said he had been working there so long he no longer ate there...? Not sure if that was a good or bad comment. He told me my dish was one of the most popular on the menu -but didn't directly say it was good. Being a former server/bartender I'm a little sad that this guy couldn't ball up and tell me if was the most popular dish but it sucked.  Other Main: Chicken fajitas -they looked awesome, huge portion, his only complaint was that he was not given enough tortillas   Drinks: Top Shelf Margs! Awesome. Great quality tequilla  Location: Near Uptown NC   All in all I was extremely full and felt weighted down when I left. But maybe that's the way you always feel after you stuff your face with chips, salsa, rice, beans, pork and margs.  Good spot if you are in the mood for Mexican.  Also 4-7pm they have a drink special at the bar!! Great deals."}
{"text":"I will have to say the veggie enchiladas my sister and I ordered were very delicious and enjoyed every bit of it.  I was also impressed when the waiter told us the pinto beans had pork in it and replaced it with black beans. As much as I would like to give this place a 4-star rating, I can't because we were not told there was a \"sharing\" tax!! I have never heard of place that charges you extra if you share your entree with someone, so much for curbing portion control when restaurants offer a entree that could feed a family of 5 now a days. I was not thrilled with the hidden charge until we received our bill.  If you want modern Mexican I would suggest Vida in downtown, they have yummy food and there is NO share charge!"}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch. I heart entire lunch menus that are seafood based. Mmm.   SERVICE: Friendly, prompt, but I will say unmemorable. Though not in a bad way, I suppose.  FOOD: Crab and guac tacos with shredded cabbage salad? Count me in. Many other choices involving shrimp and crab in the quesadilla and fajita areas as well.   ATMOSPHERE: Great outside area - recommended if the weather's good.  PRICE: I spent a total of $6 on my delicious lunch. Great for a work break.  En short, are you always squabbling with your work crew for a good place to get noms at lunch time? Bring them here. You won't regret."}
{"text":"Amazing Saturday Night here! Gets busy so make sure you set time aside for waiting. Chicken Fajitas we're excellent, as well as the quesadilla. Great service by Hesham!!!. He was so friendly, and kept in touch even though he was extremely busy. His personality was top notch as well. Please courteous to servers during busy nights. They are moving as fast as they can. We we're very, very pleased, and will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I visit approximately once every 2-3 weeks.  The food has been decent.  Today, we absolutely loved it.  We found out that they have a new head chef.  A big improvement.  My friend usually takes half of her lunch home but today she devoured it."}
{"text":"This place was really nice! We came to eat after the teacher rally with some coworkers. They have really good drinks and the shrimp po boy tacos are great! Jessica was great as well and had great drink suggestions!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AT THIS LOCATION. AVOID.   We were really - and I mean - REALLY excited about this location opening because it's so much closer to us.   We have been obsessed with their food for years. We were always at the Dilworth location, followed them to Park rd, and we've even hosted big parties at Matthews. Matthews location just catered a family event for us a few weeks ago and they did a great job.   But. Oh. My. No!   The uptown location needs an intervention STAT or it's going to fail. We certainly won't be back until we hear that there's been an overhaul.   Front of house needs major help - I don't think this is an experienced staff. No one seems to understand BASICS of customer service, or just even basics of good manners.   Try to remember that you're in the hospitality industry and your customers pay a premium so they can enjoy food and a fun experience. Learn some basics about how to speak to customers, try not to talk over them repeatedly, or raise your voice at them when they try to ask a question.   Also, if you happen to see or hear a co-worker not treating customers well, maybe step in, and tell them to take a break. The complete lack of professionalism that just seems to be ok with everyone is troubling.   And it is intimidating to ask someone who seems so agitated to accommodate you for fear they'll spit in your food. Never mind complaining about your food. I think a lot of people will be one timers at this location and never come back.   As a rule, maybe don't tell your customers \"no\" like you're talking to children, when they ask for a substitution they've gotten for over ten years simply because you don't want to or are afraid to check with the kitchen.   The kitchen needs help as well. I've eaten this food many, many, many times, over many years at the other two locations, and the uptown location isn't executing them as well.   There is just an overall lack of flavor, textures are off, things are little greasy, etc... could be just our couple of experiences but we've eaten both lunch and dinner here on weekend and mid-week and it's been the same issues.  We ordered a take-out dessert that came with a strawberry on the side - the strawberry was covered in mold. I threw it out immediately but I wish I'd taken a photo to post.   Either the desserts were sitting in their containers for days and days or someone stuck a moldy strawberry in there knowingly. Because there was no way not to see it. And it also means that the person who put it in the bag didn't bother to look at it either.   It's absolutely unacceptable all-around. They need to start over here."}
{"text":"Hand's down my favorite \"Mexican\" restaurant in Charlotte...but be sure to make a reservation as it is always crazy packed.  The guacamole is a must-have, as well as the sangria or one of the multiple flavors of margaritas. I've tried quite a few items on the menu (chopped salad, tortilla soup, enchiladas, quesadillas, tacos, and fajitas) and all are out of this world (multiple vegetarian options are also available). As I said, we frequent this restaurant.  Cantina has great happy hour specials if you're sitting at the bar between 4-7pm during the week. And the patio is a good place to hang out with friends in the spring/fall. The servers are always friendly and on top of their sections. Only downside is that you have to be careful where you park. They're sticklers for towing where signs are posted - highly recommend you use the valet.  And before you leave, be sure to get the Tres Leches cake. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"If you follow my post, you know I am always down for a margarita. lol.  don't judge me lol. anyway it's taco Tuesday, this is the closest place to my job so a coworker and I decide to go here. There aren't any taco specials on the menu for Tuesday and only 2 drink special. It is also kids eat free on Tuesday...really on taco Tuesday, why not do Thursday? Food was good,  I like the 3 different options for salsa. I ordered the al pastor taco and the other pork taco. I could only find one after loading up on chips, salsa and guac."}
{"text":"Great food. Good portions and the Margaritas were good. They staff was pretty friendly as well. I was also thrilled that I could watch College football as well. Pretty Authentic place. I would go again."}
{"text":"Food was average at the best. I had the beef burrito and I would never order it again. We ordered the guacamole dip i wasn't that impressed. Also I thought overall pretty pricey place. Want be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The service and food were both exceptional!!! Our server Kayla was on point!!!!! Was very attentive, anticipated our needs, and made the experience fun. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Awesome guacamole that's made fresh right in front of you! Margaritas are fantastic and the food was amazing"}
{"text":"my sister had her 80th birthday party there.  they separated the guess  in a whole different spot.  remind you she paid to have her event there.  the food was ok.  now get down to the drinks these people, the staff was over charing big time.  they charge 1 person a drink for $9.00 and charge them  $ 30.00 and another person order 3 drinks $ 10 each and was charge $97.00 and not to mention the added 19 drinks on my sister bill she didn't order.  i will not go here again or would i recommended it to other people.  the reason why i give it a 2 star is because the food and the music was good.  we went to cantina\" ay 205 n college st"}
{"text":"Amazing! Get the Pollo Laredo -I get it every time and everyone at the table always wishes they went for it! Excellent restaurant!"}
{"text":"STOP MESSING WITH CHIPS AND SALSA!  So on two recent occasions I've been here and the chips are different.  I, like many others, am a huge fan of Cantina's chips and salsa.  Chips are salty white corn tortilla chips and salsa is just plain awesome.  Family went on Saturday morning and were given these cheap crappy unsalty bland YELLOW corn tortilla chips.  You know, the ones you get at most cheap Mexican restaurants.  The first time this happened (maybe four months ago), I pointed it out to the waiter who effectively told me I didn't know what I was talking about and acted all coy.  When it happened on Saturday, waitress told me sometimes the new people overcook the chips.  I don't know if the restaurant runs out of the good chips and has to settle for the crappy chips but there is effort being made to conceal the fact that they are using inferior chips.  A conspiracy I tell ya!  Anyway, for real, the chips and salsa are the main reason I come here, and if I'm going to be flipping a coin every time I show up as to whether I'm going to be happy, I'll have to find somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"Do you like Applebee's?  This is \"Mexican Applebee's.\" Charlotteans will eat and rave about pretty much anything, it seems."}
{"text":"Food: mediocre. I had a hard time deciding because everything sounded good, but no one at my table was really that satisfied. Service: awful. Rude and distracted, they messed up orders and forgot to refill drinks. Atmosphere was okay. Expected way better."}
{"text":"First of all, I looovvveeee Cantina.  I frequently visit the one in the park road shopping center.  We had some friends in town and wanted to go somewhere for a late lunch before the hornets game.  Cantina 1511 uptown is the perfect location.  It is a short walk from the arena, has a large amount of TVs, and the prices are reasonable.  We all ordered drinks, waters, and the queso appetizer.  It took a while to get our drinks, but the queso came out fast.  Let me tell you....their queso is not ordinary Mexican queso. It's in a little pot that the server lights a built in burner to keep it warm.  The chips and salsa are my favorite of any other Mexican restaurant.  I ordered the steak quesadilla that was packed full of meat and ended up splitting it with my husband.    Our waitress asked if we were ready for our check and we were but it took forever to get it and to pay.  The service seems to be hit or miss at this location."}
{"text":"Cantina is one of my favorite more upscale Mexican restaurants.  They have a nice size outdoor patio and lots of indoor seating.  They also take reservations .  If you want to watch a sporting event there are tons of tvs at the bar area.  Cantina does a really good job with big groups as well.  We went here for dinner and drinks to watch the PGA. (Big deal its Charlottes first one!!! )  For an appetizer I recommend the queso or quac.  They are both reallly tasty!    I have have the Marco Pollo tacos (ahhhmazing), chopped salad, fajitas, and chicken quesadilla (the one with bacon ). Everything is always really good.  The service can be hit or mess and I think that's why Cantina doesn't have 4 stars on Yelp.  Tonight I had to ask for my queso, more chips, and water refills (clearly I was starving and thirsty ), but the food was cooked perfectly!"}
{"text":"If it's a spring or fall evening and you want to enjoy some above average mexican cuisine, grab a table on the front porch of Cantina 1511.  We went during the week and simply had a plate of nachos and a few beers.  I was starving when we went and had planned to get entrees but thoughts we'd just have a good quality starter.  The nachos feature fresh ingredients and are a large portion.  By the time we ate 80% of the nachos and downed a couple Pacificos, we were stuffed!  It made for a cost effective.  I hadn't been a huge fan of 1511 in the past but that was probably 5 years ago.  I enjoyed this dish and will update my review after my next outing.  So far, I'm going 4 stars... excited to see what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"One of the few great mexican options in the Charlotte area!  While there are several things we don't enjoy from this menu, there are tons of options and you are bound to find the right meal for you.  Lately, we have been following the paleo lifestyle and it's difficult to eat out.  Not the case here surprisingly.  There are plenty of fajita options, ceviche options, and other dishes.  Prior to following Paleo, we always ordered nachos, enchiladas, margaritas and were more than satisfied!  I very much enjoy the basic mexican dive, but if you want to step it up a notch with a bit of American flare in recipe, stop in Cantina 1511."}
{"text":"So glad this spot opened Uptown! Love the homemade salsa and chips. Definitely try the queso with jalapeño bacon and pineapple. Sounds weird but it's delicious! Everything I've tried is delicious, love the taco platters and burrito bowls. They have a fantastic margarita menu and beer selection. My favorite is the Pina Margarita Dylan is an awesome bartender!"}
{"text":"Excellent patio here. Plenty of shade and nice decor. Dog-friendly of course. Good thing our pup loves snacking on tortilla chips as much as we do.   We dined at Cantina 1511 after a long day of hiking and were famished. They have $5 signature cocktails on Mondays. I got a pear mojito that was very refreshing.   The tableside guac was amazing! I also really liked their salsa and chips. it's a little pricey so bf and I split mixed fajitas. They were tasty, but I missed the beans and rice fajitas typically come with. We also got a side of the elote, which was underwhelming. Just needed a little more seasoning. It was well enough food for both of us to share, but this is not like a typical authentic mexican restaurant where you get way too much food for barely any money.   Katelyn was an excellent server! She took great care of us, and her tableside guac skills were pretty  impressive."}
{"text":"As with so many places (just about every place, perhaps), most factors depend on when you hit the joint.  The good news is that the service is solid, just about every time. Friendly and on point, quick to attend to every need you might want in a restaurant.  When it comes to the food, is when it is more hit and miss. The tableside guacamole has been good, though it's difficult to mess with this nearly ever-present starter.  The real problem is that after this solid start to a meal, it can go downhill fairly easily. The offerings are good, but often turn out better on the menu than on the plate. It's not that they are bad, it's just that they aren't particularly memorable.  Also, certain \"standard\" (Americanized?) dishes seem to be a bit more lacking than the more \"authentic\" options, so if you are feeling adventurous, take that route instead. For instance, the barbacoa seems to generally turn out well.  As has been noted, the parking is iffy - so if you go at a busy time, you might find yourself looking around a bit in order to find a spot. At other times, it's a ghost town, so that's not an issue. If you can make it at an off time, then you might enjoy things a bit better, because you don't have to worry about parking and service will be a bit better to boot."}
{"text":"Every time we come here, the service is horrible. Came in with a crowd of 8 and got sat on the patio. We all ordered drinks from the bar and they were watered down as if they were sitting there. Got 1 order of chips and salsa and never got a chance to get a refill. One of the girls was missing her dish. Couldn't even get the server to tell him. Finally told him and he said they will make it soon. After 15 mins she still didn't get it. They finally came to give her her food and she told them she didn't want it anymore because of the wait. That is ridiculous for her to not have her plate of food and to wait that long. One girl ordered guacomole appetizer and didn't even get a chance to ask for chips. Terrible. Food isn't even good."}
{"text":"Me and wifey took my dad and a friend out for drinks and some Mexican food. Me and wifey love this place and my dad and friend did also. I can't say enough about the salsa, it is some of the best I've had. The service is top notch as always and the food is the same. Will continue to come back. Reservations are highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've read the negative reviews of Cantina 1511 but for me I have had only great experiences. My family and I have been to the restaurant a few times over the past couple of years. This week I had the chance to go two nights in a row. Both experiences were wonderful--the service (thanks Stan), the drinks and the food. I really like the made fresh guacamole. My coworker from Peru liked the habanero salsa so much she got some to go. Maybe it won't always be twice a week, but I'll eat at Cantina 1511 again."}
{"text":"Very pleasant experience! Good food (fajitas), great atmosphere, excellent, prompt, and attentive service. Very welcoming to this out of town visitor!"}
{"text":"I hosted a company sponsored retirement party here. The whole process was very smooth. The staff was very accommodating. The prices were very reasonable. My favorite part was the beautiful private room we used. It was in the corner of the restaurant housed by large barn doors. The space was colorful and very roomy. We had a very nice server who attended to our needs very well. The menu we were given was So yummy. Everyone liked their meal. They came out fresh and hot. I quite enjoyed the experience and plan on coming back. If you are hosting a party, I recommend having it at cantina 1511! My organization is a state agency and we are tax exempt and cantina 1511 worked with us very well! They even let us bring in an outside cake which was very kind!"}
{"text":"Guacamole was good prepared at your table. Shrimp taco was cold when it arrived but asked waiter if he could get me a hot one & it was excellent. Chicken taco was not that good. The chicken tasted like it was boiled, no flavor. The rice & beans were not good. Beans were hard with no flavor and rice was undercooked with no seasoning or flavor. Just blah. First Mexican restaurant we've been to where we didn't like the rice & beans. Their wait staff was very friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Carne Asada quesadilla came drenched in grease.  Completely unnecessary - no respect for consumer health - literally bathed in grease and dripping from the inside out.  Cmon man!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Wait staff was very attentive and accommodating.  Thursday was jazz night.  The young performer for the evening was especially entertaining. Cantina 1511 needs more performances like this one."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte but this location is a hot mess. My friend and I dined there last Friday and everything was a mess - the host and hostess didn't take our names down correctly so we waited an extra half hour before they realized their mistake. Then they finally told us that there are seats, but no one to serve us. There were at least 5 tables open but not one was cleared of the dirty dishes. We finally sat at the bar and the server brought out our food before our appetizer, forgot silverware, never refilled our water and basically ignored us until we flagged them down. They need more wait staff and better hosts. I was shocked since Frank's restaurants are normally well run. I won't be returning to this location!"}
{"text":"I went on a Tuesday night. The service was very good and the food came out quickly. I got the veggie enchiladas. They were very good! The queso dip and chips are also excellent. I didn't get a drink but they have a nice looking bar. The prices are in the low/mid range for dinner $10.00-15.00 for an entree. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very appealing on the eyes. Nice and upbeat. When we first arrived the hostess greeted us and began answering our questions when the phone rang. Another hostess walked up and in a demeaning tone advised that she should have answered the phone. Not a great way to start the dining experience. We were sat at table #32 and greeted by a cheerful waiter. He cracked a joke and it all went down hill from there. It took 45mins for our table side guacamole to make its way to the table. Upon arrival, another 25mins for our entrees. All the while, our waiter did not check in on our table, but seemed to find his way to every other table in the section. We had to flag down someone to check on our food, who happened to be a manager. Our entrees came out wrong and cold! Thanks to the manager Chelsea who seemed to be the only one concerned about turning our experience around. 4 words: We won't be back."}
{"text":"Tacos al pastor... That's the way to go!! This place is an \"upscale\" Mexican restaurant with hip music and classy décor.  I've tried a few different things on the menu but nothing compares to the Tacos al Pastor. They have the perfect mix of spices, heat, and sweetness from the pineapple pieces. I also LOVE their chips and salsa, the quality of the chips and salsa is usually a good indicator for me of how well I am going to like a  Mexican restaurant...and theirs gets an A+! PS: Give their tres leches dessert a try...its amazing!"}
{"text":"Oh my good news the queso dip was outstanding! Our server Justin was very good to us! The food that we had was good. My wife had the quesidilla and I had the pork dish! They were both very good, and we came and sat down within 5 minutes of our reservation time, which they said they were behind! Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"I finally came back to try some food. Verdict: No. Unless you enjoy overpriced plantains.  Crab quesadilla. How do you mess that up? Flavorless. Dull. Not a whole lot of crab.  They are super super NOT accommodating to food allergies.   Waiter walked away as I was still speaking, so that's pretty awesome, too.  Was told that the plantains would be an upcharge to sub the side dish I was allergic to. What they didn't tell me was that they would simply omit the included side dish and charge me full price for the plantains.  I will never be back here. Poor food, poor customer service.  Also, some of our tableware was dirty, but the water who walked away never checked back on us, so we had to walk over to the bar and snag some clean ones."}
{"text":"Viva Mexico! Mmmm Cantina - your guacamole never ceases to amaze me. This is a convenient place I frequent whether I need a big, tasty margarita and a few delicious appetizers or when I require a full blown Mexican fiesta.  Some of my favorites include the incredible table side guacamole - that you can request as spicy as you like, the \"street\" tacos - the pulled pork with pineapple and the fried shrimp are amazing, the Mexican chopped salad - which also comes in a smaller (more manageable) lunch sized portion and, of course, the tres leches cake.  Cantina definitely has a hold on modern Mexican cuisine - just make sure you make reservations or get there early enough to score a table. It gets especially busy on Thurs - Sat evenings. Hubs and I routinely grab a table in the bar area to avoid the wait. They also have a great patio that looks on to East Blvd.  Great food, great service - I'm a big fan of Cantina!  Oh and be careful where you park - while Cantina does have quite a sizeable parking lot, make sure you read any signage posted - the neighboring stores/tenants will tow you if your in the wrong spot at the wrong time!"}
{"text":"My wife Melanie and I ate at Cantina 1511 Park Road location Saturday Night the restaurant had a good size crowd which is encouraging to see. We were greeted very warmly even thou their was a lot of activity going on. We were seated fairly promptly. Our server arrived very soon after that very friendly her name was Michele. Explained the menu and made some recommendations. Michele was very attentive even thou the restaurant had a lot of activity going on. We ordered the chicken fajitas and the three different types of tacos. The food was very tasty and came out in a very short time even thou the restaurant was very busy. Would highly recommend if your looking for Tex-Mex style of food and ask for Michele very friendly and had a good understanding of their menu."}
{"text":"I need to get here more often. They've added some things to the menu but I keep ordering the same thing because I don't go here enough. My go-to is the Tacos Marco Polo with shrimp, jalapeno, and bacon. The table-side guacamole is delish. Next time I'll try the guac sampler. They've also added a family style option for at least two people that we will try next time around."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Cantinas around town and I always enjoy them. The funky tacos are innovative and tasty. Highly recommend the Thai shrimp tacos! Prices are right and service is friendly."}
{"text":"Did you know Cantina 1511 does brunch? Well, they do. And spoiler alert: it's pretty fantastic.  My friend Erin and I were starving after our Yelp Quirks Out event at Jazzercise Charlotte. Time for a boozy brunch! Hey, we earned it with that workout, right? We tried to hit Sir Ed's, but they didn't open until 5pm. Fail. So, we wandered across the parking lot to Cantina 1511.  I'm a sucker for a spicy bloody mary, so it was a no brainer for my drink order. They use a serrano and cilantro infused Finlandia vodka for this one. Win. We weren't sure what to get. Here's what I love: the waiter completely jumped in and was honest. He told me to ax my original order and gave us his ranking for the brunch dishes. Erin went with his #2 pick: the avocado bake. I went with the #3 pick: the fajita style shrimp and grits. He nailed it with both of those dishes. They were delicious. And in case you were wondering, his number one seed is the arepas benedict.  I wasn't sure how I would feel about this new location, but I like that there seems to be more parking. Yes, the shopping center area here can get crazy, but the lot can handle all of it.   Cantina has great salsa. The tableside made guac is a must get. The tortilla soup is solid. I think I order something different every time I come here. It's all pretty good.   This place can handle a group pretty well. I've been here for a couple different birthdays and girls night type events. They do take reservations. You can also place orders online for pickup."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in about 2 years and decided to go last night. The silverware I got was dirty and had stains/food remains on it and my wine glass also had some food particles on it. So I asked for new silverware and a new wine glass. I ordered soup as an appetizer and the spoon that came with it was dirty too. I took it to the bathroom and washed it because that's the only way I could assure that it's actually CLEAN! I barely ate any of my soup and I requested the tab and left. I cannot eat in a place that does not seem clean and sanitary, that is a big issue for me. The management here really needs to look into this and make some implementations to ensure that their dishes and silverware are actually getting cleaned properly. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I'm very snobby about Mexican food, especially since I live in LA and I have traveled a few times to Mexico and had some great meals in these places. If I'm anywhere else in US (but Cali), I try to avoid Mexican because I feel like it won't measure up.  Our hosts wanted to take us to Cantina 1511 because they read good reviews about it - it's described as doing a modern twist on Mexican fare. We had a reservation, but still had to wait to get seated. The decor was just OK, the layout- the place is too wide, wherever you're seated you lack privacy. Not a fan.  The food - chips and salsa were OK. The guac was decent. The drinks- they have an extensive menu, we picked a drink- a new twist on Margarita, basically a pineapple drink on the rocks, it wasn't anything great, I barely could taste any alcohol, pretty weak.   The food, that's another story. We ordered tacos and enchiladas. Someone in our party hated her enchiladas (Enchiladas de Pollo), the tortilla was hard and it did look strange, like they were too baked, over cooked.   The tacos were OK (the selection was decent), we got Carne Asada, Ancho Pollo, Johnny Carnitas between us. The problem was the shell, it was so thin, that it broke once you had your first bite, which never happened to us before in a restaurant or at home (with shells you buy in stores). It was hard to enjoy them. The beans were fine, but my issue was with the rice. You serve white rice? Seriously? In a Mexican restaurant? It was blend, a bit sweet with some corn in it. The meal lacked authenticity, as I feared. Prices are high, I guess this is the \"upscale\" part.  The ambiance, there is none, they have huge TV-s, it's so loud that you can't have a conversation and I had to yell at our server so that he can take  my order. Not the way I like it. Also, we had a family with 3 kids behind us, so they placed a bassinet with a baby right behind my chair. And right when they brought my food, the other 2 kids started running  behind my chair, touching me, pushing me, yelling while the parents didn't seem to care less. Not an enjoyable, peaceful meal.   As far as the Mexican upscale twist, well that's just a publicity stunt. Skip it if you're really into good Mexican food!"}
{"text":"This is my husband and my favorite restaurant in Charlotte! Our favorite items to get are the chicken quesadilla, burrito, nachos, and tacos (especially the al pastor!). Our only complaint is that the tacos, if you get soft tacos, are usually soaked in the juices from the meat and sauces. By the time they come to your table, they are close to inedible because they're so soggy. This doesn't happen every time, but often enough that we tend to order other menu items even though the tacos are our favorite! Their salsa and guacamole are delicious as well. Although, we think their guacamole is a bit overpriced. We enjoy getting take out from here too and they are kind to offer to put the nacho toppings in separate containers so that the chips aren't soggy by the time you get back home! Staff are very friendly too!"}
{"text":"Always a great meal! I love the chips because they are thin and lighter than most Mexican restaurants. Loved the jalapenos and onions added to the queso dip. I always get the crab and avacado quesadilla - it never dissapoints! My husband got the steak fajita, he loved it but it came with weird veggies like cauliflower and uncooked green peppers. Our waiter, Ben, was super attentive and friendly!!"}
{"text":"Worst dining experience I've ever had in my life. I cannot imagine worse customer service and having worked in customer service it takes a lot to get under my skin. The table next to us had been there an hour and hadn't received so much as a water or chips and salsa. We all had reservations and it was not busy. The staff simply did not care. Not the hostesses, the servers, or the manager we encountered. Then the manager's excuse was \"some of these people have been working since lunch time.\" I will never be back to this location or any other. Do yourself a favor and pick anywhere else to eat. Uptown is full of options and if they keep this up it won't be open for long."}
{"text":"Came to Cantina Sunday night to satisfy my craving for some good ol' Mexican food. I was NOT disappointed. From the minute we sat down we knew it was a good decision; at 930 on a Sunday night this place still had a good crowd, which I can't say I've seen at any other restaurant around, given they are actually open on Sunday nights.   I agree with pretty much everyone else's review about the prices - more than you'd probably want to spend  for dinner, but worth it all at the same time. And if you are having a hard time parting with your cash just order a patron margarita and it will suddenly, rapidly, get easier to cough up the dough.   I won't repeat what's already been said, but I will second everything Jason L. says about the two kinds of salsa you are presented with when you sit down. Our server could tell we were hungry and she replenished our salsas without us even having to ask. Maybe she was just afraid we'd bite her arm off given the speed we were eating at, but either way, she knew service.   I asked for the tofu & veg fajitas, and then my fiancee ordered the steak and shrimp fajitas and I couldn't take it anymore - I switched my order to the chicken & shrimp fajitas (yes, I am struggling and teetering on the line of vegetarianism and carnivorism - and I had to give in here). I was so happy when my food came out - everything looked so fresh and juicy! (note: this statement may be influenced by the fact that the only other place I've ordered a fajita from in the last 3 years was Chili's, and yech, not so good there). But anyway, the fajitas were delicious! And very filling. Save this place for a special occassion if you are worried about the prices, but definitely go!  PS - visit their website and turn up the sound, and tell me you didn't shake it."}
{"text":"We have eaten several times at the Cantina 1511 on Park and found service and food to be very good. However this was the worse restaurant experience we have had in Charlotte. Arrived late Sunday afternoon, place was empty. Took overly long to get seated, waited forever for service. Food another inexcusable long wait and came hard and cold - even the rice/beans. Tried to discuss with surly manager, who would only kick back on one meal very reluctantly. Never again!"}
{"text":"Love the new venue.   Such an upgrade from the East Blvd location.  The cocktails are a 10!   They make some of the best drinks in town.    The menu is nice and varied and I have tried many items from Soft Tacos, to Fajitas, to pork tenderloin.  I'm never disappointed.   The last time I went, I asked for NO Tomatos....my food arrived with tomato all over it.  The waitress realized that happened within 30 seconds from when the food was dropped at the table.... she took it away and a fresh plate was delivered within 3 minutes....it was quite impressive.  Love their Chips and Salsa and Guac.  A visit to Cantina is always a treat and NEVER disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been a Cantina fan at both locations, but I prefer the East Blvd. location as it has more character. The Ballantyne location is pretty cookie cutter in terms of a strip mall location. This review is for the East Blvd. location.  My Mom was in town, and with one meal a couple of years ago I've made her a Cantina fan as well. She insists on Cantina at least once every time she visits. No problem here. :P  The day we visited was for lunch on either 3/31 or 4/1, I can't remember. Must always for me: table-side guac and the Marco Polo Tacos. I really do want to try different entrees, but every time I do, I wish I ordered those darn tacos. I'm sold on them.   We ordered the table-side guac, I ordered the Marco Polo Tacos, and my mom ordered the Wild Mushroom Quesadilla. The guac, as usual, was super fresh, bright with the lime and spices. My tacos were amazing as expected, and plated enticingly (first time I've seen their new plating for these). The chopped salad with the tacos is always so good, very fresh and a welcome change from the regular side salad you get with any meal at different restaurants. My mom loved her quesadilla.   The one thing I wasn't that happy with was the blood orange margarita. It almost had the taste of a machine margarita, and definitely had way too much mixer. It would be nice to see these with real blood oranges shining through in the winter/early spring as they are in season.  Our service was very good. Our waitress checked on us often, offered suggestions and recommendations, and was very friendly.  Please, Cantina 1511 - don't lose the atmosphere on the move to Park Road Shopping Center. :( Don't become cold like the Ballantyne location. :("}
{"text":"We had the worst experience. Waitress was absolutely miserable. She made no effort to accommodate our requests and had a scowl on her face the entire time. We waited close to 45 mins for food to come out. One of us ordered fajitas, which came out on a white plate, looked like something from a frozen dinner. When we asked why it wasn't on a sizzling plate, she said it was only served that way at dinner- seriously, when have you ever had fajitas NOT served on a sizzling plate. The chicken & veggies weren't even hot. The waitress never asked how everything was bc she knew we were unhappy. This restaurant has gone down hill over the years. I don't think I will ever return. How disappointing to spend $100 on lunch only to have a waitress ruin the meal. VERY DISAPPOINTING- stay away."}
{"text":"There is absolutely no resisting a bowl full of warm, crispy tortilla chips and fresh homemade salsa when you sit down at this spot.  No. Resisting.  Trust me, I've tried.  IMPOSSIBLE.  And the guac that they make at the table? Insanity.  I'm all about fresh ingredients, and it doesn't get much fresher than that.  The drinks are yum-tastic also (can't go wrong with a marg at a place like this).  Lunch selections are great, and the service has always been fantastic there!  Everything I've ever had on the menu has been of superb quality and very very very very very very verrrrrry tasty.  ...that is, if I can actually fit any lunch or dinner into my stomach after eating all of the chips. FREE REFILLS, FTW!  The only reason it isn't 5 stars is because of parking.  Be prepared to walk there if you get there during busy lunch or dinner hours.  And don't park at Starbucks, you WILL get towed."}
{"text":"My visit was after the lunch crowd, around 1:35 on a week day and we were sat immediately.    If you've never been, the decor and atmosphere can be classified as Americanized-Mexican.  Plenty of parking available. The ambiance is nice, decor is that of a mix of modern and Pier One Mexican decor.  There's modern American music playing, but it is very possible to have a conversation with people at your table.   Clientele is a good mix of stay at home mothers, old pals catching up for a drink and others there to have business lunches. Most are dressed from casual to business casual. Bar area wasn't busy, 3-4 patrons sitting at the bar. They offer daily drink specials but I didn't partake in this during my visit.   Our waiter was very attentive.  I was there for a quick meet up, to have some appetizers and not having a full fledged meal.  We ordered the Prima Guacamole (made at our table) and were very specific that we did not want anything spicy in our guacamole.  Waiter listened to us and made our guacamole perfectly.  Fresh tomatoes and lots of lime and a smidge of cilantro - just how I like it.  Chips were warm and had perfect salt seasoning - not too much, not too little.   We also ordered the Chicken empanadas off of the appetizer section.  This includes 4 triangle empanadas filled with  cheese, chicken and Pico de Gallo.  Perfect serving for two people. The plate was garnished well with a bed of lettuce and bits of tomatoes for the empanadas to lay in, empanadas were drizzled lightly with chipotle ranch and serve with side of guacamole and sour cream (not spicy). These empanadas were flavorful and served at perfect temperature!   We then shared a Cuatro Leches Cake to satisfy our sweet tooth.  Cuatro leches is a cake with four types of milk poured over it.   It is topped with a sugar-merengue, garnished with mint leaves.  It was DEVINE but very rich for just one person to have, in my opinion.  We shared this cuatro leches cake and between the both of us were unable to finish it.    We enjoyed our visit to Cantina but felt a rushed at the end, as our waiter brought our bill at the same time as our dessert.  Our total visit was less than a hour long, there were lots of open tables and no one waiting to be seated so I thought perhaps it was shift change."}
{"text":"The food was just okay to begin with and it has steadily declined over the past few months. My favorite dish used to be the enchiladas rojas (beef enchiladas). Well they changed the way that these are cooked, now they are just cheese enchiladas with a beef topping on top. Doesn't taste the same."}
{"text":"This meal was a big disappointment, food was not special and service was bad.  we choose to sit at bar as tables were unavailable. Had to wave bartender down to place an order, service was the worst I have experienced in years, there were a total of 7 people at the whole bar which made it so surprising .  All food was cold, and they had back waiters bring it out, could never get refills on beer, actually got worse at the end. Got desert to go since it took so long, tres lechees was terrible. I have been a regular at this groups restaurants for years as they have grown, first time I felt like I was at a chain restaurant. Hope we just had bad luck but I won't go back to that location again."}
{"text":"I love Cantina 1511!   Complimentary Chips and Salsa: Wish the chips were less hard and more light and crispy. But they give you a generous portion of chips and salsa and the salsa is good.  Guacamole: Was everything I expected and more! The habanero peppers gave it a great kick, was impressed. Awesome.  Tacos: YUM. I couldn't decide which I liked better between the Asada, Chipotle Ancho Chicken, and Pulled Pork. Asada steak and pulled pork were definitely in the top. I was a bit skeptical of the pork and pineapple combo, but they know what they're doing here at the Cantina.  Barbacoa Entree: It was really good, although a little dry. I didn't notice much of the dryness because it came with a heaping portion of avocado and the beans and rice were addictive. Top that baby off with a sprinkle of the cheese and that explains why I feel super preggers right now. It was worth it... delish.  Nutella Pie: For $5.95 this is not bad because the portion is huge, but I wasn't really a fan. It was covered in more chocolate and caramel sauce than I cared for; I guess there is such thing as too much of a good thing. Also, it was a little too mushy.   Overall this was a great experience and the food was good - the server filled up the water quick, came to check on us frequently, and was glad to split our bill. Plus, the damage was a mere $42 between 2 people for the 3 tacos, guac, Barbacoa, and pie!"}
{"text":"Not worth the time let alone the money... Given I live close by I was really routing for the place and even went twice. Second chance was just as disappointing as the first."}
{"text":"We headed over to Dilworth to eat at Lebowski's the day after Christmas only to have our hopes dashed when it was closed.  Luckily, Cantina 1511 was open across the street.  And as a Mexican food snob, I can safely say that Cantina has the best salsa I've had since I left San Diego.  Spicy without being too spicy, flavorful, and good consistency to adhere itself to the chip.  I now regret not trying their guac.  Decent food overall.  But man, that salsa!  Start bottling it."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd time to Cantina.  The first two visits were decent, but I thought a bit overpriced. My third trip was a dissapointment.  I brought out of town family. 3 of us ordered the Barbacoa - which was highly recommended by our server. I thought the meat was very salty. I was surprised when my other 2 family members who love salt said the same thing.  Then I knew it wasn't my imagination.  We made mention to our server and she apologized.   My margarita was heavy on the sour mix and not terribly authentic.  For the price, there are many other lower priced options in the area."}
{"text":"If you don't want to get blitzed by downtown crowds, this is your best option for Mexican food in Charlotte. The venue itself is outstanding. Lots of indoor and outdoor seating, a full bar, great ambiance, etc. As for the food: A+. There is a full specialty taco menu, quesadillas, burritos, enchiladas, appetizers galore, and plenty more. I ordered a chicken chimichanga and immediately ascended to the heavens upon the first bite.   The drinks are outstanding too. They have 10+ margaritas and just as many tequilas. Drink specials all week. What else could you want from a restaurant? Desert? Yeah they have that too.  Satisfied beyond expectations. Good work Cantina"}
{"text":"Kris was a fabulous waitress and suggested a wonderful Margarita that we very much enjoyed! It's the El Grande if you were wondering"}
{"text":"The food and drinks were overpriced and bland. This restaurant was our favorite Mexican restaurant when it was on East Blvd. It must have changed hands. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"We love Cantina 1511 at Park Road Shopping Center! It's kid-friendly, lots of indoor and outdoor seating options and a wonderful menu. The guacamole is awesome. The salsa is our favorite. The location is perfect too. Lots to do in this area before or after dining."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service! I came last weekend and it was packed. The next time I come will be strategically planned around the rush hours."}
{"text":"My wife and I were craving mexican and happen to be in the dilworth area.  We decided to stop and give them a try.  Just for some background information, we love mexican.  Biombo's in concord is our favorite and for in charlotte we enjoy loco lime.    I will say that this is not a bad place.  I gave them 3 stars because this is not the mexican food that we enjoy.  First we ordered the Queso with our chips.  This is not the regular white queso that many mexican restaurants want.  This is more of an authentic queso, it has onions and is slightly brown compared to white that we are use to.  So my wife nor daughter really liked that.    We all got burritos and thought they were ok.  The carne assata did not have the best flavor and just was not the best one I had.    I do not think this place is bad and could see how people would love it.  I think it is just not my cup of tea.  On a better note the table service Guacamole looked great.  If i ever find myself back I will give it a try.   For regular visits I will stick with Loco Lime and our number one favorite Biombo's"}
{"text":"The atmosphere, staff, and of course the food were fabulous!!! Very reasonable at $30 special. Includes soup, salad, entrees , and dessert for 2!!! $5 Margarita's. Super impressed"}
{"text":"We ate at Cantina's former location on East Blvd several times, but hadn't ventured to their new Park Road location since they moved.  We go to Flying Biscuit across the shopping center frequently for breakfast, but Cantina 1511 doesn't open for brunch before 11, so we never arrived late enough to give them a try.  Lucky for us, they offered Easter Brunch one hour earlier, so we were able to finally try their breakfast.  I have to say, I like this location better than East Blvd.  It's roomier and brighter, with tables a bit further spaced apart than the smaller previous location.  They play awesome rock music, too.  The Easter menu was the usual brunch menu.  My husband and I both had the huevos rancheros - mine with scrambled eggs (with cheddar), and his with fried eggs.  I can't begin to describe how good this dish was.  Unlike other places, Cantina serves their huevos rancheros over two cheese quesadillas.  There are black beans underneath the quesadillas, which are then topped with eggs, salsa, Mexican crema, and cotija cheese.  Both of our eggs were cooked perfectly, too.  Their chips and salsa are also phenomenal.  (Yes, we ate a full basket while waiting for our eggs!)  Their chips are really thin and light, and their salsa is fresh, with finely chopped tomatoes and fresh cilantro.  It's medium spicy, in case you were wondering.  It's so good!  Their coffee is also delicious.  It's very strong, and has great flavor.  Service is friendly and efficient here as well.    We'll definitely be back.  I only wish they'd offer earlier brunch all the time."}
{"text":"Brian greeted us like family and Stephen was an awesome mind reader. He got an extra tip because I could not make up my mind. Perfect food for a rough Monday!"}
{"text":"I found our lunch to be very bland and lacking any of the complex layers of flavors found in real Mexican food. THE black beans & rice that came with the barbacoa tacos was as if they were poured out of a can into plain white rice. The red bean antojote was again uber-Bland antojote tasting of canned beans. I might be too much of a food Diva.... but i could make better at home. Enchiladas? bland again."}
{"text":"Cantina 1511 is great! Definitely check it out. The food is a bit higher priced that your average Mexican eatery but the quality of the food is higher as well... and Cantina is more Tex-Mex actually. The guacamole is fresh and fashioned up table side when you order. I'm a big fan of this as it makes the guacamole smoother and your server asks you your heat preference - great for spice lovers like myself!  I had a crab meat quesadilla and side salad on one on my latest ventures and both were phenominal. Highly recommended. The margaritas are quite tasty as well, never too sour, and you have a vast menu to choose from, all in different styles and flavors. I tend to make friends with margaritas quite easily so eventually, I'm sure I will befriend them all. Multiple times.   This joint gets busy busy, especially at night, so reservations are recommended here."}
{"text":"A colleague of mine is getting ready to retire, and she did not want a lot of fuss for her retirement party. She's also a tequila lover, so what better way to send her off than to have a fiesta!  Event planning at Cantina 1511 is pretty seamless. All of their options are posted online, and they offer invoice billing and tax exempt, which is so helpful when you work in the nonprofit sector. They even offer gluten free options as part of their event menus!  We used the private room in the back of the restaurant, which was free to use for a lunch event. It is well sectioned off and is truly private, but it is not a separate room so you do hear noise from the restaurant crowd. No biggie to our group!   The food and service were terrific. We had a set menu with four entree options as well as salsa, chips, and guacamole for starters. The guacamole is clearly freshly made in house. It was delicious! I split an enchilada with chicken and spinach as well as tacos carne de asada with a coworker, and both were equally good. I also appreciated that our server did not rush us and kept pace with our group as needed."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Incredible Service, Incredible Food, and Incredible Prices!!! We were served last night by Hunter D (or so says the receipt). I can quite honestly say he is one of the best waiters I have ever had.  We were seated immediately upon entering the restaurant. Within a minute or two of sitting down, our waiter came over to get our drinks started. We both ordered a beer.  He left and came back minutes later with chips and salsa (delish!!) and our beer followed closely behind. He took our order at the same time.  We ordered the tableside guac (which was delicious) and our mains. our waiter showed up again minutes later, and made the guac for us. He left and we dug right in! he came by to see if it was to our liking and we said it definitely was.  our meals arrived a few minutes later.  He was the type of waiter who knows when to approach the table, and when not to. He was there before our drinks were empty, and came by to ask how our meals were. When I asked if I could box the rest of my meal (the chimichanga is massive) he said he would do that, and also throw in the chips and salsa and the guac.  Our meal (3 beer, table side guac, chimichanga, and 3 steak tacos) came to 57.38 with tax. This will definitely be our goto Mexican! Especially if we can have Hunter as our waiter. I really can't say enough good things about him! He was absolutely incredible!"}
{"text":"The Good: Meh....wasn't impressed BUT wasn't dissapointed either.  For ME (Me being a Texan and loving all things mexican food related) it was just ok.  I ordered the fish tacos (which were good..not GREAT but good) and I was happy with them. Everyone else loved their food as well and it all came out Hot!!!!  Big plus for food served HOT.  Loved the music playing out in the patio area. We were dancing at our table.  Always fun....  The Ok: Margarita that was supposed to be top shelf and their best one...tasted like a smoothie sin taquilla. Husband not happy but is too kind to send it back.    I ordered i guess you could call it the Skinny Girl Margarita and it tasted like concentrated lemon juice.  No bueno.  Pino Grio please!!  (yummy as always)   The What the??: Table made quacomole was the ONLY dissapointment.  I mean huge let down...  I love quac...i could swim in a tub of quac...I would have quac everday of my life..My Hubs who hated quac before he met me tasted mine- is now a quac LOVER.  They put hot sauce in it...hot suace.  Hot. Sauce??  No.  I mean some folks love it that way but if I would have seen her making it, I would have jumped up to save the qreen goodness from being tainted w/ the hot sauce.  And again...some and MOST people love it this way but I do not.  And it could have been jalapenos or something but it was something that was amiss...so I will just blame it on mr. hot sauce.  :)  Overall...I like this place and will def be back!  (with my own avacados and fixings for the quac)..LOL!!  Just teasing."}
{"text":"I am so mad! I stopped in for lunch. It was my break and I thought I had plenty of time to eat. It took forever for my server to come to the table. I order my entree and desert together and told the server I was in a hurry. He came back with water and chips and I sat forever waiting on my food. I waited for 20 minutes for my food. I saw my food waiting in the window long before that! The server said they had to run other food before mine could be run. As he was bringing my food 30 minutes after my order, I told him to pack it up. I got no apology, I had to pay for my food which over $20 dollars and cold by the time it came to the table. They were not rushed and there seems to be no reason for such a bad experience. I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Our waitress, Chantel was extremely inattentive. She would come ask if we wanted drinks and would get one drink order and run away. The food was ok but the fajitas were 90% veggies and 10% protein which was extremely disappointing. Understandably it was cinco de mayo but the restaurant was only at 60% capacity and had plenty of waitstaff. This was extremely disappointing and I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Unique selections. The burritos are HUGE and very good. The lump crab & avocado quesadilla is my favorite. Table-side guacamole is also delicious.   Has complimentary valet  and outside seating."}
{"text":"I went here on a Saturday night at 7pm and as crowded as it was (1.5hr wait) we just hung around the bar area and picked up the first free spot. It ended up being a high top table and they just cleaned off the cups and plates from the people before us. It's first come first serve for that whole area - there's booths, the bar, and a few long tables. The queso was really good and filling. I got the chicken quesadilla and I am not kidding, it was THE BEST quesadilla I've had in my life. Definitely coming back when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Review update!!  Still a great place to come. I had the grilled fish tacos and the Al Pastor.  I have been dreaming about the fish tacos since last visit.  I was VERY disappointed in it this time!  The fish was fishy, cold, and the mango sauce or salsa that comes on top was literally like a cold jelly or ice cream topping. It was smooth with the consistency of ketchup and seemed like it was opened from a packet.  Yuck!!!  I will never order again.  The Al Pastor stayed true and was delicious.  Great flavor.  The side salad was also delicious.  The dressing comes mixed in and the amount is perfect.   Good service and chips & salsa were divine.  Love the atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"Service was very slow. Our party waited forever and ended up not even getting what we ordered. A weren't discounted for it! There is nothing special about the food or the salsa. It is pretty expensive also. Won't be back, plenty of better Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my time in Charlotte visiting a friend. I suggested Mexican and without blinking, her first option was Cantina 1511. From servers to cost to drinks and guac I give them 5 out 5! I'll mos def be returning in future."}
{"text":"Gotta hate on a place that pays for top-o-the-listing spots in our revered database, no? (Check the Three Amigo's pagina, if you no te creo).  I want to. Bad. But I can't, because the food - dressed up, calmed down - is good. Not stellar, not blow-your-tastebuds-out-your-nose amazing, but good. And that's Numero Uno when it comes to restaurant going, at least for this sometimes-angry belly.  I'm sitting there with TRP stuffing gringo-red salsa down my throat (seriously with the tomato paste people? srsly?) and giving the green stuff the skeptic-eye when we get our 1511 Queso - no bacon, but all pineapple-and-onion covered - and damn if I didn't eat 1/3 of this all by myself. Cheez Whip via Mexico City with soft tortillas (as a dipping implement, new to me) and a side of jalapenos. It was sick nasty good, in that secretly-I-eat-Easy-Cheez-outta-the-can way that we do so well in CLT.  It's true there's only two things a veg can eat here, and I went, mehly, with the Taquito - and, once again, decent, deeply flavored, nice texture, plated haphazardly but well. Diff beans than Ms T's, white rice, no guessing at what animal stock you're pretending not to swill.   Dug the idea of Family-Style Taco Consumption. I'd never seen that.  Would I go back? To stand in line for an hour on a Fri, hell no. But for 7 dolla lunch? You bet."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte! Great authentic Mexican food, fun atmosphere. Even though I usually get the same thing (Enchiladas de Dennis), I have never heard anyone say they didn't enjoy their meal. The service is really prompt and the wait staff is friendly and helpful without being cheesy. Even on nights when it appears crowded, the restaurant seems to be really efficient with turning tables without rushing people in and out."}
{"text":"I met friends here Thursday night and this past Saturday night during the CIAA TOURNAMENT and ordered the Short Ribs entree and it was absolutely amazing, not to mention a very agreeable portion.. The staff is very friendly and accommodating and the Jazz musicians...OMG.. Incredible vocalist.... I highly recommend this resteraunt... They do not disappoint!!!! An uptown treasure for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the place was really calm and clean. We like the sever , she was very friendly and the service was very quick. Would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"We arrived about 7:35 with the family.  We did not get served until 8:30 and it was awful!  I mean terrible.  I do not know how they stay in business...It was not very crowded and they just kept bringing chips.  It sure isnt the same place as when Ben owned it for sure!  We told them we would pay 1/2 and never, never return...worse Mexican food in Charlotte....and we know food!  We did tip the waiter very well!"}
{"text":"Table-side guacamole is fantastic. The goat cheese, spinach wild mushroom quesadilla is my favorite. Portions are large. Service has always been efficient . Reservations recommended on weekend nights"}
{"text":"With much trepidation and encouragement from management after my last visit, I decided to give Cantina 1511 one more chance. Sadly I left disappointed yet again. When my date and I arrived I was told there was a 30 to 40 minute wait to be seated, not a big deal given that it was a Saturday night. What the hostess failed to inform me of was that it was 30 to 40 minutes without factoring in the reservations she had on her list. In my opinion, those should have been factored into the estimate or at a minimum mentioned so that I could factor them in myself. After waiting an hour and 30 minutes we were finally seated. Upon being seated we were met by what I'm assuming was the front of the house manager who promptly offered us a drink and appetizer on her, which we graciously accepted. A few minutes later we had placed our dinner orders and were enjoying our table-side guacamole and queso along with a lovely house red wine. After about 54 minutes, our dinners had finally arrived (a bit of a lengthy wait for dinner, but it was a Saturday night). Much to my dismay mine was incorrect. What I received was very tasty, but again, not what I ordered. The general manager of the restaurant came and spoke with us and decided that our dinners that evening would be on him for our inconvenience and picked up our check. With all of that being said, please let me add that I have never received less than exceptional service from the wait staff at Cantina 1511. When there is an issue, management seems to go above and beyond to try to make it right for you, but if they would focus in making it right the first time, they wouldn't have to try to make up for any shortfalls that occurred during you dining experience."}
{"text":"I've been here on several occasions when Cantina was on East Blvd. They ruined my birthday in 12/2013 and I swore it off. Nevertheless, I decided to give the new location a chance. Surely that awful server was fired by now. Everyone deserves a second chance and I'm glad that I did. Went on a Saturday and it was packed, so we sat at the bar, that had plenty of empty seats. The bar tender was very attentive, making the guacamole by hand in our presence. Throughout the meal, she check on us consistently and even offered advice about the menu. I had the salmon, which came with potatoes and spinach. The salmon was smaller than what I expected, but was really tasty and ended up being filling. So I guess the proportions were adequate after all. My friend, who is a vegetarian had the wild mushroom quesadillas and she liked them a lot. The guac that came with them was small compared to the amount of quesadilla. So I would ask for heavy guac if you order a quesadilla. Additionally, I had the house margarita. Tasty and I had a little buzz. Be careful with the margarita on the rocks as it's stronger than frozen. Overall, a great experience. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is the first Mexican restaurant I have been to in Charlotte that was run by Americans and more upscale than most Mexican restaurants. I'll start off by saying the food was delicious! I was impressed with the food and waiter, but not the wait time and cooks.   I ordered a beef chimichanga without beans. After waiting about 40 minutes or longer on our order, our food arrived. I cut into my chimichanga and saw mostly black beans and also realized that the bean juice (whatever you want to call it) was drizzled over it as well. I sent it back, and maybe 4 minutes later received the next one. I did specify after the first one, not to put the bean juice on the second one. When you order something without beans you would think the chef would realized you don't want bean juice on the food either.  At first glance it looked correct, but once I cut into it I saw that it was a chicken chimichanga, NOT beef without beans as I ordered. The waiter never asked if it came out correctly, and fortunately I love chicken so I ate it and didn't complain. I was glad in the long run that it was chicken because it tasted so good. The salsa inside was so fresh and delicious, how could I say anything.   I would go back, but not without a coupon. This is the most expensive Mexican restaurant I have ever been to ($14.75 for mine). The other disappointment was the booth. The seats were so low that is was uncomfortable.   There is patio seating outside, but right beside the street. I don't know if you could hear the cars driving by, but I assume you can. We were there on a weekend evening, and we could see a guy strumming his guitar and singing. The people on the patio seemed to enjoy his company.   My overall experience was frustrating, but the food was really good. I don't think I would go back, just because they seemed to busy to care about the customers."}
{"text":"Don't come here with a party larger than 5. We were here for a dinner, with a party of 15. We arrived here at 7pm were sat, and our waiter took care of our drinks. Unfortunately, I believe it was also our waiters first table of a vast size. After sitting for about an hour, our meal orders were taken, and they came out in a greater than timely manner. Then we ate.....and played the waiting game. Our poor waiter was left to himself to divy up the checks (spilt between 5, all seated in order and not changing). He came back with our checks, which were not split correctly, besides one couples. Then, that couple paid (over $100), and the manger came and said it was confusing and wanted to split the rest of the check between everyone, at $25 each. This did not appease anyone, especially the people whose meals were less than $10. Finally, after about 45 minutes of trying to figure this out, the manager FINALLY came out and made us retell our orders one by one. This was a whole ordeal at a table full of previous servers that could have been easily avoided.   Additionally, the food, it was just sub-par (will give props to the table side guacamole).   Overall, there are plenty of different restaurants in this complex or other Mexican restaurants in the area to satisfy your craving."}
{"text":"I enjoy their South of the Border nachos. For 6.99 you get a half order and it is enough for two people! I always need help finishing them, since they are piled high with yummy ingredients such as beef or chicken, guac and sour cream, cheese, pico, and more cheese! I also enjoy their assortment of cerviches! The enchiladas are all delicious, you will have a hard time choosing one. The tacos are good, and the barbacoa is divine!"}
{"text":"This place is neck to neck with Chuy's near Southpark Mall.  Amazing food, especially those Chicken Enchiladas!  So glad I ordered the guacamole, it was made perfectly table side.  The drinks were ok, nothing great about their house margaritas.  I would definitely recommend it for a nice dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. We had the guacamole and Cobb salads (add the steak). Sandi was our server, and she was very attentive and super nice"}
{"text":"Disappointing food, great service. I ended up with Chicken Enchiladas, but I ordered cheese. But the chicken came with a tasty green chili and creme sauce. Without the sauce, they were tasteless. My husband's burrito looked good but had no flavor. Happy that I didn't pay for it."}
{"text":"Sooooooo... I ate here today and the food was NOT QUALITY. It was one of those restaurants where when I left, I was actually upset that I paid money for that bland, unseasoned, mediocre burrito bowl. I asked for salt for the \"burrito bowl\" I was eating and it still wasn't enough to bring some life to the taste of disappointment that ran across my tongue with each bite. I honestly think there is more spice in a doughnut from Suarez bakery across the street. People rant and rave about how good this place is and simply put... it's just NOT all that at all.   2 stars because the food did come out fast, but this is a situation where I wish it hadn't come out at all."}
{"text":"The waitress, Katey was awesome!! She was very knowledgeable about the menu and was able to provide suggestions about everything. I ordered the guacamole with crab and goat cheese and it was awesome. My partner ordered the short ribs with mashed potatoes and beans. He's still raving about the taste but wanted more vegetables. One of the best Mexican restaurant in Charlotte hands down !"}
{"text":"Not a huge menu, but a nice selection of tacos, tortas, etc.  Server was nice and friendly, but wasn't knowledgable of what was on the menu. I asked about the appetizer \"Antojitos\" and had no idea. I asked him to find out, he comes back with vague descriptions with Spanish names I'm still not familiar with and neither is he. I once again asked to find out what is was. Really? I ordered it based in his description and it came out and was different than what he said. Normally, I'd send it back but was starving. Wasn't bad. It was mostly fish, we think. It included small potatoes croquettes, some type of cheese mini burrito, I think swordfish on a chip. We each ordered one taco, the crispy pork. I asked how big they were in case they were the small ones, I'd order two. His answer was \"regular size\".   I ordered it anyway and was a nice size and very flavorful. The rice and beans that came with it was DELICIOUS! I'd go back, but they need to school the staff on what the food is and their descriptions. I know a lot about food, but I'm no ethnic expert. Help me out Here!!"}
{"text":"I had a rough time at Cantina 1511 which is shocking because I've always had a great meal there in the past. I went with a friend and we ordered out lunches. When they were brought out she found something in her taco. It wasn't a hair but it looked like a bristle from a brush. Then I got a bone in my taco. The GM was fantastic and came right over and took care of our meal for us after apologizing a million times. Once would have been enough but he really wanted us to be happy. That is great customer service. I've eaten here a million times before and this is the only time I've ever had a problem but it was quickly corrected by them. They took our plates back and replaced our meals then kindly picked up our check. I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"First off I need to stay the service is awesome and the waiters are very nice. The gluten free menu is why we went. Daughter has Celiacs and the staff is trained and the menu is very well done in regards to gluten. that's is the only reason they get 2 stars. Im not going back however.  O.k. down to the food. Its awful, the food is OVER SALTED, its plain salty. The chips salty, the queso has to many sweet onions that overtake it, same with the stake quesadia,  the burrito and tacos are non edible. I ordered the steak burrito and did not eat it. picked the meat out, packet with undercooked rice and stale cold tortilla.. My wife ordered the enchiladas swissa verde and the chicken was boiled and dried out. It had a disgusting taste to it. I tried to take a bite but the smell made me gag.The beans are undercooked and so is the rice I'm sure to the casual chain eating diner they may be o.k. with this place but if your a foodie. stay clear. Oh and the beer is really cold which they got right. Summary staff great, food awful, beer cold."}
{"text":"Pretty good modern Mexican. I wouldn't say anything we ordered (fajitas, quesadillas, pork platter) were anything above average but everything was very good. We waited for about 30 minutes on a Saturday night for a table. Once we were seated, the service was pretty quick and we were served rather quickly. Would come back here. And definitely recommend this place if you like Mexican!"}
{"text":"My experience at Cantina 1511 was just okay. We went on a Saturday night and there was an hour wait, which is fine so we just went to the bar to have a drink.  The Problem I had here was trying to get the bartenders attention, It took 10-15 minutes to order 2 margaritas. To top it off, I felt like the margarita was just all sour mix, I couldn't taste the booze at all! Next we sat down and our server was very nice and kind of funky. But the food we brought out was just okay. I was in the mood for some really good Mexican food ( and we have heard good things about Cantina) but at the end we just got an OKAY meal. I probably won't return."}
{"text":"You pretty much can't go wrong with ANYTHING you order here and drinks are awesome as well. Very creative takes on the usual Mexican and Texmex favorites. Fresh, flavorful, great presentation, superb service and prices are very reasonable. Great for lunch or dinner. Fun atmosphere too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Cantina since they moved and I enjoyed it. The decor was nice. I had the El Vaquero quesadilla to eat and it was pretty good. I also had a margarita and maybe I should have ordered top shelf (or no ice) because I didn't really feel like I was drinking alcohol. It does seems like they are a little onion heavy because there were onions in the queso (a first for me but kinda good) and I had a great deal of onions in my quesadilla so be mindful of that."}
{"text":"Great food and good service! The table side guacamole and quest are two of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the good stuff. They have a fantastic patio. Our server was attentive and very nice. However it just seems that the kitchen is always behind. It took us over 40 minutes to get our food once again. This is our third time there, I would go back. But the food this time was Bland and not very exciting and it just tasted and look like it said in the window for a while."}
{"text":"Party of 18.  Where do I start ?   Chips came fast, waters took 20 minutes, drinks another 10 minutes.   Food was average on our end of the world. Some happier than others.  Most voted average to below average.  My fajitas were average, never got my wraps or sides.  I gave up and ate off the plate.  The server was average .... I debated one star but beer was cold so landed on 2 stars"}
{"text":"The vibe is cool and the bartenders were nice. I ordered the chicken bacon ranch quesadilla and it was fire.... however I ordered a Paloma with Casa migos tequila, and it had little sugar flies in it. The bartender remade it and it had flies in it again. I asked to remove the drink from my bill, and it was.   Loved the vibe but won't go back because of the flies in my drink 2 times."}
{"text":"The crab and avocado quesadillas are amazing! Love sitting on the covered patio in the summer. Kris has been a great server!"}
{"text":"Waitress was new. She didn't know the menu. She was slow and didn't bring more than one drink at a time. Paid a lot of money to eat Taco Bell quality food"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Cantina 1511! The food is delicious, the staff is attentive, and the prices aren't too shabby. The guacamole is made fresh right in front of you which I'm a huge fan of. It is a about $10 so I would say it's good to share with others since you will have plenty of leftovers. I would definitly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! My sister-in-law and I went for our birthday dinner. I called at 10:18 am the morning of the dinner to book a reservation (yes I know the exact time because I had to show the guy at the front (presumably the manager) my call log). The person I spoke with took my name, number and amount of people in my party. So imagine my surprise when I get there to discover there is no reservation. They advised they would get us seated in about thirty minutes. Annoying but a few people in our party were running behind so I didn't make to big of a deal about it. we grabbed drinks while waiting for a table. Well time continued on and all 16 of our party members corralled around the bar, at this point starving so eating chips and queso, whilst standing and seemingly aggravating the wait staff that walked by us. Finally after waiting over an hour, we are seated. Determined to have a good birthday I press forward. Unfortunately, there was only one server assisting and she seemed to already have multiple tables in addition to ours. She never took an actual table drink order, just brought out water, and if you could catch her walking by you could request an alcoholic beverage. Every time a question was asked of her, the tone always seemed annoyed that we even asked as opposed to wanting to be helpful. Our food took over an hour to come out and no one's food was hot. My boyfriends fajitas were so cold that he could put his hand directly on the cast iron skillet. He described it to me as \"refrigerator cold.\" Management offered to give us 3 free apps for the table. I had to flag the waitress down to order them. Unfortunately the first two appetizers I wanted they were out of, so kind of had to take what was available. All in all, I would describe the experience as chaotic, unorganized and completely disappointing."}
{"text":"Decided to have dinner here on a Friday night. There were so many things going on in charlotte and the place was empty. I sat at the bar and had to wait for longer than necessary. There seemed to be one bartender and no waiters working. I asked if the kitchen was open they said yes. After not getting great service I decided to leave and head somewhere else for dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent meal with Daniel as our waiter. The guacamole, salsa and chips were amazing!"}
{"text":"Came in before heading to the Trans-Siberian Orchestra concert. I got in between the rush. I was sat in the back/top section and wasn't served for 15 minutes while 2 other parties who were seated after me had their drink orders taken and salsa and chips brought out. Eventually one of the waiters on the section came and asked for if I wanted drink. From then o. The service was amazing. Out waiter was Jeffrey and he ensured the rest of our dining experience went smoothly. We had chicken nachos, Thai shrimp crispy tacos. He struck up a conversation and found out we needed to make our 7:30 show and went as far as to reach out to the GM to ensure our food came out in a timely manner and we could enjoy our meal and make the show.  We will definitely be coming back and bringing our family too.  Thank you Jeffrey!"}
{"text":"This was our friends favorite place in Charlotte so I was excited to give it a run. Great little spot, I liked the look and feel. I went with the Chimichanga because I read a review where it \"sent her to the heavens\" ha. Loved that. I may not have been raptured but it was good. They have a great queso and salsa, no complaints. I'm not particularly a cilantro salsa fan but it wasn't too much and didn't distract from the fresh taste. Service was on point. Would have loved to enjoy their nice patio but it was a little chilly."}
{"text":"If you're looking to overpay for your meal, then you have the right place. I've definitely experience better Mexican restaurants in Charlotte. Wait staff is pleasant."}
{"text":"What a delicious unique restaurant.. Not unique because of the food but because of the environment and the service.  Food - It's Mexican food.  All you have to do is close to right and it is delicious.  They easily took care of that.  I have the Johnny Carnitas Tacos and they were amazing.  The service is what blew me away.  They really know how to take care of the customer.  We sat in the bar area and were immediately greeted and our drinks were taken care of.  They told us all about the margarita options and the servers knew all everything about the dinner choices.  It was truly a wonderful experience that I look forward to experiencing again.  Tip top service, beautiful surroundings, and excellent food.  You wont be disappointed.  Enjoy!  -Ian M."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp tacos-excellent.  The complimentary chips and salsa is very good and fresh.   Customer service was great not a long wait at all for a Friday night."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican restaurant I have ever eaten at.  I usually don't even care for Mexican food, but I love this place. My wife is going to have a hard time convincing me to eat at any other Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"We arrived rather early for dinner, around 5 pm on a Friday. The restaurant was near empty so we had our choice of tables. Enjoyed a front window seat, excellent service from Nivia... and some really great eats (we are fairly recent ex-San Diegans, who take our Mexican food seriously). We don't find a lot of good Mexican on the East coast side... outside of major foodie areas like NYC but Charlotte definitely has a selection and the Cantina is a good choice. Excellent margaritas, great tacos and guacamole... would definitely ask for spicy. The spicy wasn't our definition of spicy, but it was quite flavorful. Our first test of a Mexican restaurant is the chips and salsa, both very good here and made in house."}
{"text":"I decided to try out Cantina 1511 primarily because it got good reviews and was listed as one of the best Mexican restaurants in Charlotte.  I was prepared not to like this place because it seemed to be to hip and trendy for me.  I don't really care what a place looks like as long as it is clean, well maintained and serves good food.  I went to Cantina 1511 on a Saturday for lunch.  It was a cold, rainy day but the parking lot was pretty full.  Since I was by myself the hostess asked if I wanted to sit in the bar area and that was fine with me.  They had high top tables and leather couches to sit on.  I grabbed a seat on one of the couches as it was near the TV and I could watch some football while I ate.  I thought the couch might be a problem when it came to eating, but it really wasn't an issue.  The waitress came over shortly after I was seated, dropped off a menu and took my drink order.  I order a Dos Equis Amber, which I recently discovered is an outstanding beer.  She gave a few moments while she got my beer and some chips & salsa.  The menu is pretty simple with traditional & tex-mex version of the standard Mexican fare.  I ordered three tacos from the traditional menu, al pastor, carnitas Johnny, and carne asada.  I sipped my beer and watched the game.  My food came out pretty fast.  The presentation was very nice and the portions size was good.  I tried the carne asada taco first.  It was delicious.  The flavor of the steak was excellent and it was very juicy.  I really couldn't tell you what other garnish was on the taco, because I was concentrating on the flavor of the meat.  I'm pretty sure there was some sauteed onion and peppers which complimented the meat well.  Next I tried the carnintas taco.  It was also delicious.  The flavor of the pork was great and it was very juicy.  Last was the taco al pastor.  Slow cooked pork with shredded cabbage, roasted pineapple, habanero crema and fresh cilantro.  I thought the combination of the pork and pineapple would be interesting and it was.  This taco was good, but didn't quite do it for me.  I'd probably double up on the carne asada or carnitas next time.  The plate came with tortilla slaw, vegetable rice and beans.  The sides were all pretty good and a nice compliment to the meal.  To me Cantina 1511 seems to be a hip, trendy place, but I'm a middle aged fat guy. I was very skeptical and prepared to not like it, but Cantina 1511 serves some very good food.  The service was excellent and the prices were very reasonable.  I learned my lesson here, don't judge a restaurant by it's trendiness, judge it by the food it serves.  And for Cantina 1511 it serves some very tasty food."}
{"text":"Great food and service the menu covers a wide variety of taste and flavors this place is great we came back for brunch and OMG and waiter Manny was the best we will be back again and again"}
{"text":"The menu was varied, not the same old \"rice and bean\" Mexican fare. The food was awesome and the wait staff attentive but not constantly hovering and being intrusive. A great date place, business dinner, or fun night out on the town, I highly recommend if you are tired of the cookie cutter Mexican restaurant"}
{"text":"Just had lunch there and sat at the bar. Bartender was awesome! The food was outstanding! My first time there and I had the chicken chimichanga......best I have ever had! Great prices too! Manager was awesome too.....made sure everything was great and gave me an appetizer card for their table side guacamole for my next visit! I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I've been to Cantina 1511 several times (both at the old East Blvd location and the new Park Rd location) and it never disappoints.   I'm a big fan of their tacos. I think they revamped they're menu since I was there last because I think there were way more taco options than before. I got the Angry Bird (Buffalo chicken) and the That Chili glazed shrimp tacos. Both were fantastic. I might have liked the shrimp one slightly more, but it's hard to pick one.   We went for lunch and out was pretty crowded. The service wasn't the fastest, but that's understandable considering how crowded it was.   I'll definitely be back again in the future!"}
{"text":"We went  right before they were closing and ordered take out from the bar. The bartender was nice and attentive, and even though they were closing he still took time to explain options. My drink was good and I didn't feel rushed. I would definitely return because of the service alone. I ordered Tacos, they were okay, I want to try them again dining in hopefully they are better."}
{"text":"This was the first dinner we had on a recent trip to Charlotte to visit friends. Cantina 1511 was recommended by my friend's coworker so none of us really knew what to expect. The food was much more high end compared to what I was expecting, so if you're looking for a good ol' messy cheese covered burrito, this probably isn't the place to go. They had a really good looking list of tacos, but I ended up trying the crab quesadilla. Per the recommendation of the waiter, I added shrimp. The server told us the chef was a great seafood cook...no disagreements here, I loved it! Very different, but if you like seafood, it's a solid meal.   Honestly, there were a lot more items on the menu that sounded amazing and I would've loved to try, but the prices were really steep. We chose to split a picture of the blue margarita and honestly, it was nothing special. When the servers (not our waiter) brought the food out, he spilled my boyfriend's drink all over him. The owner and our waiter apologized, comped his meal, and brought two fresh drinks over on the house. We compared the two side by side, and the new drinks definitely had a little/lot of extra love (and by love I mean tequila).  If you're going to drink here, skip the pitcher and go with the individual drinks.    I can't say enough good things about our waiter we had there. He also mentioned that during the summer he plays music out on the patio, so if you like live music, definitely come by in the summer to check it out. All in all: great place, awesome food and service, not the best drinks in the world."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!   We ordered drinks, table side guacamole, and our entrees all at once. We waited half an hour and our entrees came out. We still hadn't received our guacamole or our drinks. We would've made our waitress aware of this, but she didn't come by our table between us ordering and receiving our food. We made her aware when she delivered our food, so she went to get the other items.   The manager came out to us and apologized as they were having a busy day, and she prepared our guacamole. She gave us the Guac for free which was nice, but we also told her that we hadn't gotten our drinks (now an hour after we ordered them). We asked her to cancel them, she did, and she again apologized.   We won't be back."}
{"text":"Kayla is the most AMAZING server in the world. She was extremely perceptive to our needs, not hovering over us when unwanted. She answered questions regarding the menu and ensured our food was spot on. Cantina has fantastic food and would recommend to anyone, but when you add servers like Kayla you get a world class experience in uptown."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been regulars at Cantina Rea Rd for the past few years. Our last couple of visits have been disapointing. Our last visit was this week and I think it will  be our last. We ordered the shrimp fajitas and the Enchilada Verde. We were disapointed with both. The shrimps on he fajitas were smaller than ususal and the vegetables were thinner than any other time. The plate was full of caramalized onions.  The Enchilada Verde was not even close to the description on the menu. According to the menu, the plate is prepared with spinash and mushrooms. Yet , the plate we got was nothing but a combination of melted cheeses.   The service was ok but nothing special."}
{"text":"Came in as a small group of three on a Friday night. We were seated promptly as the restaurant was rapidly filling up.  The dining area is large, separated by walls and sliding doors in certain areas. Tables are close together which causes a loud environment, not the place for extremely private or intimate conversation. Unfortunately our table was right by the silverware steam cleaner and computer for all of the staff to put in orders/obtain checks, etc. There was constant traffic by our table and it grew increasingly warmer as the steamer kept being opened and closed.   The dining room seemed clean, however, the same cannot be said for the women's restroom. I am understanding of the fact that on a Friday night there is a constant flow of patrons, my suggestion is to ensure you have a staff member assessing the conditions often. Restrooms represent you and the quality of the visit just as much as everything else, especially if it has everyone in there cringing.   Our waitress was (semi) friendly at times, distracted at others, and slow moving for the majority. Once she got the idea that you were finishing your final sentence she would walk off as you completed it. Refills on drinks and chips were slow, and we never got refills on salsa...maybe I missed the fact that refills of salsa weren't a possibility? I will say the salsa had great flavor and a nice kick and the chips were warm.   They have some vegetarian options for food (all include mushroom as the main ingredient) as well as GF options (corn tortillas). I had the enchilada verde, my boyfriend the steak and chicken fajitas, and my sister the BBQ 1511 platter. I think the flavors of my dish were inventive and worked well together. I don't think it was out of this world, but I enjoyed it as an average dish with slight questions about the freshness of ingredients. My boyfriend also felt unimpressed about his dish, but my sister enjoyed hers as unique and flavorful.   The drink menu is plentiful, fun, and covers every aspect of alcohol possible. But sadly the margaritas (I had the El Dorado) seemed slightly weak. There is a nice patio if you enjoy outdoor dining.   Overall this is a slightly overpriced establishment. The pricing is not reflective on the way you receive service, the environment, or quality of dishes. If in the future all of the listed qualities bump up a notch, it wouldn't seem overpriced anymore. Overall there were positives and negatives but we still had an enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"If you have ONE thing here, make it the table-side guac! The tortilla soup is delicious (especially on a cold day), so after all those guac and chips, I like to have the soup for my dinner. If you like shrimp, the Marco Polo tacos are really great. Oh, and even if you don't get the guac, the salsa is tasty and the chips are warm, crispy, and unlimited. If you go on a Tuesday night, it's kids' night, so if that's not your scene, ask to be seated in the high top table section--the kiddos are usually on the other side. Outdoor seating is nice, too, when the weather is good. The food at the Rea Road location (Stonecrest Shopping Center) is just as awesome, but the atmosphere is a little more upscale. You can't go wrong at either location."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd bad review of this restaurant, the 1st i did via open table back in august 2014 but chose this way since it is more visible and again it is my 2nd bad review and perhaps it will be noticed more by the restaurant. My husband and I decided to do an impromptu supper/movie date night. The restaurant next door had a 1.5 hour wait, cantina had none so we chose to go there. We were sat immediately and noticed that the seating had changed as did the look of the menu. We waited, and waited at our table and were not acknowledged at all by anyone.  My husband and I are very patient, we both worked in the industry and understand things can get busy but it is expected that someone should have acknowledged us, even if it was to say \"ill be right with  you\". I looked at my cell phone  after being there a bit and said to my husband \"if no one comes in 3 minutes were are leaving\", I waited 4 and we got u p and left. We stopped by the hostess stand to let them know why we were leaving and decide to walk to one of the other restaurants in the plaza. The manager did chase us down and apologized (which was definitely appreciated and warranted) but we had a movie to catch and were not happy, it was too late. This is the 1st time I have ever walked out of a restaurant, it was the 2nd time we had a huge issue with service. I do not think we will be back, we waited a long time between our last disappointment and this time and were let down again. Again,we understand things happen but I can tell you that one of the 1st tings I learned in every restaurant I ever worked in is, patrons should be greeted in some capacity as quickly as possible (within 3 minutes).  Perhaps this is one reason they had no wait while their competitor had 1.5 hours."}
{"text":"I do love Mexican food, and have been to various places all over the country.  I was disappointed with this restaurant.  The service was great--the food not so much.  We ordered Margaritas.  Everywhere I've pretty much have had a Margarita, it's Tequila, a triple sec or higher quality liquor like Cointreau or Grand Marnier, and lime juice.  They use orange juice, and that's all you could taste.  I ordered fajitas.  The platter was huge, but they only gave you three tortillas. Fajita should be simple--protein, onions and peppers.  The condiment plate had pickled carrots and onions that overtook the rest of the condiments.  They could simplify the dish, and it would be better.  My companions dish was inedible.  The manager was fantastic and offers a free desert.  We got the tres leche,  one of my favorites.  It would have been good, but they added marshmallows or fluff all over the top.  Again, service was good, food I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I used this restaurant for a corporate team building dinner and paint event. There was mixup with the event coordinator who booked us at the other location. I was very stressed as I had about 30 people counting on dinner and the other location was 45 minutes away. This location was able to work with me to allow us to have the event there even though they were not expecting us. The staff was very friendly, helpful, courteous, attentive, etc. My team really enjoyed the food, beverages, and service. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was a couple weeks after opening so I gave them a pass.  This go around they've been open around a year.  I ordered a birdsong ipa and the chimichangas (think super troopers).    The beer wasn't very cold, but very fresh.  The bar staff was very slow to recognize me while the bartender and manager gossiped at end of bar.   The meal came out quickly. If you want bang for the buck come here because the portion size was humongous. The meal overall was a sloppy success, I enjoyed the flavor and textures on par with any other Mexican joint.   My biggest disappointment was to see they still serve their house margaritas from buckets of pre made margarita.  Not mix and they add tequila, just communal buckets of margarita they pour all night.  Deal breaker for me, but the food may bring me back."}
{"text":"This was a delicious choice for dinner last night.  Based on recommendations from other Yelpers, we ordered the fresh made guacamole (which was delicious!  Maybe it's the poblano peppers?) and the \"hot\" salsa (which we didn't find very hot).  Our server was very friendly and when we mentioned it was our first visit, she walked us through the menu and made some great recommendations based on what we were in the mood for.  We weren't prepared for the half price pitchers on Mondays, but I did have a very tasty frozen margarita.  We ordered things from the \"Authentic\" side of the menu and were not disappointed. The Camarones Mojo y Ajo had a delicious unique flavor.  The Enchiladas Sulzas were very tasty, and the side of beans are AWESOME.  We also each enjoyed a taco on the side - I recommend avoiding the crispy shell (with so much stuffing it broke fairly quickly) but the Carne Asada and Carnitas Johnny tacos both were delicious.  We had enough food to feel super full (even though their desserts sound tasty too!) and I have some leftovers, too.  It was a bit pricier than we're used to paying for Mexican food which may prevent us from going all the time, but we'll definately be back!"}
{"text":"New to the Charlotte area and I'm not gonna play the I can't give something 5 stars cause nothing is perfect gig. I have it 5 stars because for what it is the place has perfected their craft. Valet parking recommended otherwise parking is tight around dinner time. Our waiter Carlos was energetic and very knowledgeable of all the dishes. Suggestions were appreciated because it lead to try duck for the first time.  We ordered the table side guac because of how good we heard it was and they made it to your preference right there next to you. My girlfriend got fresh margaritas, and chicken enchiladas which had a spinach and cheese filling and a queso sauce on top. I ordered 3 tacos, carne asada in chunks, duck breaded with cilantro, and shrimp and scallop with a spicy sauce. All equipped with taco kickstands when you need a break. They're size is deceiving, they're super filling. All the toppings were fresh, taste buds were tingly.   Portions were big enough to fill you up and bring home leftovers. Overall an excellent dining experience. Will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food in Charlotte.  You have the choice of traditional mexican or tex-mex."}
{"text":"Okay so we walked in on Saturday evening at 5:20 pm. There were probably a total of 5 tables occupied in the entire restaurant one of those being on the outdoor porch. We requested a seat on the porch and the hostess said that she couldn't seat us because there were people with reservations coming in. The place was deserted. I clicked on open table and there were reservations available for 5:35 and on. Seeing how we were turned away we were not interested in eating there. We walked right across the street and went into to Vida and were happily seated on the patio no problem."}
{"text":"We went to Cantina 1511 for dinner before a concert at Spectrum Center. We did not have reservations which was our first mistake. The hostess promised us though that we would be seated with 20-30 minutes.  We checked with the hostess stand after 35 minutes and we're told we'd be seated soon. A full hour after we entered the restaurant we were seated. My assumption is that they were short- staffed because as we were escorted to our table, we passed several open tables.   Our waitress was relatively slow to get over to our table and we were prepared to order immediately since time was running short. We told her we were in a hurry so we could go to a concert and she told us that it would be hard to get drinks from the bar or food from the kitchen within an hour.   We settled for water and appetizers, neither of which was very good. I am at a loss to figure out how a restaurant can't staff servers and the kitchen/bar knowing there is an event nearby."}
{"text":"Just ordered take out from them tonight. They said it would be ready in 20-25 minutes and we literally live across the street so we were there at 20 minutes. The food must have been sitting for a while because the food was cold and needed to be reheated. The 'bowl' of soup had two small meatballs in it. The 'pint' container it came in was also not filled and was a good inch from the top. I called and the person who answered said it came with two meatballs and that was the right container. The other food was decent but we probably won't be going here again."}
{"text":"Pros:  Hearty portions. The chicken fajitas are decent but the chicken was dry the last go round.   Burritos are giant and the queso version is ridiculous. Wear your stretchy pants ;)   Full bar with daily drink specials   Salsas are good but do wish they had a bit more spice.    Cons:  Their \"gluten free\" chips are just Tostitos that we're not fried  Crowded and sometimes slow service   Their house margarita is crazy sweet."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill. At least this location.  It was like a McDonald's playroom.  Screaming kids and bright colors everywhere.  The back room is literally like stepping into chucky cheese...we were there for a ladies night out and they tried to seat us smack in the middle of that junk. It was horrid.  We requested another seat and it was slightly better.  Our server was sweet and the guacamole is still good.  However, my tacos and whole dish came out cold, flavorless and nasty.  The wine list is brutal and the prices don't make sense.  It used to be this cool trendy spot but honestly since it has changed into a playpen they need to adjust the menu prices accordingly.  I have zero desire to come back. Stonecrest might be better but I highly doubt it."}
{"text":"I gave this place 4 stars strictly based on their table side guacamole.  That is a true test when it comes to a \"mexican restaurant\" and Cantina definitely doesn't disappoint when it comes to their guac!  It is fresh, flavorful and spiced to perfection!    As far as everything else is concerned....it is just OKAY, in my opinion.  It is a trendy, mexican-fusion restaurant so you get what you pay for...and you pay quite a bit!  Everything is typically pretty fresh and tasty but I don't know if the prices are justified.    Maybe it's just me, but I can't fathom valet parking and waiting an hour for mexican food.  I like my mexican food straight up, authentic and dirty and so the \"hype\" around this place is just a little corny to me.    The parking lot is too small for the volume of guests but they DO take reservations so that is a good thing.    All in all it is a fun, good place to eat but make sure you have realistic expectations before going!  And, remember--the guacamole alone is worth the visit!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Cantina 1511 location several times and I haven't been disappointed yet. When you first arrive, they'll bring fresh salsa (hot or mild) with crispy tortilla chips. I love their tortilla chips. They're so light with just the right amount of salt. And there house-made salsa is so fresh and delicious. I recommend the Prima Guacamole that is made tableside. It has fresh avocados, tomatoes, lime juice, and sea salt. It's one of my favorite appetizers. The Baja Fish Tacos are good too. They are grilled fish with shredded cabbage, lime, yucatan onions, and a sweet and spicy mango aji amarillo sauce. It is nicely seasoned with a slightly sweet taste.  I've had the shrimp fajitas here before and they are really, really delicious.  The decor is bright, vibrant, and modern with a traditional flare. They have a cool mural of Frida Khalo.  They had live music when we came on Sunday. The musicians were talented and one guy sang some of his original music.  They last time that I came Max was our server. He was so personable and  attentive. The portions are usually big enough to share."}
{"text":"Very nice Mexican restaurant. The portions are big and the price was reasonable. Great selection of Margaritas. Make sure to call for a reservation and parking can be a little tricky."}
{"text":"Best Mexican spot in town! Jamal is an awesome server, the food is very authentic, the ambiance is very classy but relaxed. I've tried all the Mexican restaurants, and none can beat this one"}
{"text":"I want to start off my review by saying we really like the food here.  The chicken tortilla soup and fajitas are great.  Now to the problem.  We were given a $50 gift certificate to Cantina 1511 for xmas and went there Sunday 1-11-15 to use it.  After ordering a few drinks and fajitas our bill was $33.  We were told by the manager that the remaining balance of $17 was not redeemable and we would lose it.  Why couldn't they just give us another gift certificate for the balance???  The manager told us \"she just works here and that's the way it is\".  I'm not sure why they can't join the rest of the world and use gift cards, but it left a bad taste in our mouths and we may not return."}
{"text":"Had the Pina Margarita and Mexican BBQ Pork. Both were delicious and I had so much food.. I couldn't even finish all of my pork, but I definitely tried it was so good. Our waiter was super friendly, overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"Cantina 1511 is a very nice Tex-Mex restaurant. The service was great. Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. The ambiance screams modern mexico with an American twist. From the outside walking in, Good luck finding parking, I had to park on the street because parking is limited. Luckily the neighborhood is a pretty good one so I had no problem with that. I had the \"Enchiladas de Pollo\" which was pretty damn good to me (it was plated nicely/ could of been better but I'm not picky about that). Yes, it was on the cheesy side but I like cheese. The chicken was a little dry, that's were all that cheese came into play. I think they would of had a 5-star dish on their hands if they brined the chicken first and then grilled it. Overall I was happy with my dish. The dinner party I was with had the some of the dishes pictured, 1. Chimichanga (looked F'n Delicious) 2. Ancho Chicken Quesadillas (the chicken chunks were actually pretty big). No one complained about their food but I can say the prices were moderately higher than your average Mexican restaurant, that would be a major downfall for me to go back to Cantina on a regular basis. If your ever in Charlotte of course I would inform you to check out this place for any special occasion. Just make sure your ready to spend a little more on Mexican food."}
{"text":"What a great combination of Authentic Mexican and Tex Mex.  The wait staff is great, the food is excellent, the bar specials are good, and the overall experience is solid.  The parking is somewhat of a challenge, but you just work through it."}
{"text":"After seeing a movie, we decided to check out Cantina 1511. We arrived around 6:15 on a Sunday night and were quoted a 10 minute wait so decided to hit the bar. We ordered two house margaritas which were awesome! We were paged after about 15 minutes and seated. Once we were seated we received chips and salsa and asked if we needed a drink refill, which we did. After reviewing the menu, we chose the pork tacos and chicken fajitas. While we waited we enjoyed the fresh chips and salsa, which had a kick, which I loved. The smell in the restaurant was great so we were anxious for our food to arrive. The pork tacos were amazing! The pork was moist, almost melt in your mouth and had chopped pineapples which added a great flavor. And, the fajitas, best I have had in a long time! Piping hot, great grilled veggies, and accompanied with warm tortillas and a great assortment of sour cream, cheese, guacamole, and a few other items. What a great experience and I look forward to getting back to this location!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately since Cantina has moved from East Blvd to Park Road Shopping Center it has not been the same. I have visited multiple times since the relocation and haven't updated my review because I wanted to give them a chance but unfortunately I cannot say that it has. This most recent visit prompted me to update my review. I arrived on a Wednesday evening with no wait, great. Chips and salsa were delivered and we ordered a few margarita's. I chose the house, the Casa Margarita, and was told it was premixed. Well, let me tell you, horrible! It is so sweet that I actually sent it back. Decided to go ahead and order a Corona, arrived with no lime, really??? As for the food, I ordered two tacos, chicken and pork, both great. But unfortunately I ordered rice and beans and the rice was so bad I cannot even explain it. And, the fact that they placed the beans in top of the rice, which should never be done, did they know the rice was bad...trying to cover it up? Wrong!!! Overall, there are too many Mexican restaurants that this is not on my go to."}
{"text":"Great food- not your usual, ho-hum menu. I had fish tacos- good flavor, fresh and oh, so yummy! Will definitely go back....again and again! Staff is excellent, as well."}
{"text":"Great lunch today!  The nachos were some of the best I have had, the hot salsa was spicy and tasty, and the service was impeccable.  This was my first time eating here and I will definitely make a point to come back."}
{"text":"Neighborhood  , good food, lots of beers on tab, and specially kid friendly!! Winning!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here over the weekend after a movie.  It was about 10pm so I can see why the service wasn't that great.  It didn't take long to get a seat, but it took forever to be acknowledged by a server.  We sat out in the patio, which is probably the best part of the restaurant that night.  It shares the patio with Firebird next door, and they had an acoustic guitar guy playing.  It's great ambience.    Since we filled ourselves up with movie popcorns and soda, we didn't per se have dinner.  We shared the tortilla soup and the shrimp & crab ceviche.  The ceviche was ok; the soup wasn't much to write home about, it was more like a tomato veggies soup than tortilla soup in my opinion.  For beverages, I had a white sangria which was more sweet than strong.  His dragon something was very much like a mojito and was better than my drink.  All completed with a set of dirty silverware.    In all, Cantina serves the purpose of a decent place to eat that has some kind of an atmosphere.  Definitely not the best of anything, but it's an ok option."}
{"text":"Enjoying lunch with teacher friends and the best server at Cantina 1511 - Uptown! Thanks Jessica!"}
{"text":"Cantina 1511 is new uptown. We went for a weekday dinner. When we arrived we we're greeted and seated at the bar quickly. Our serve forgot to take our order so we asked someone else to. When ordering I asked about a sauce the description I got was very vague. Our food arrived in good timing and was alright. I asked for a to go box and our waiter once again never brought me one. I'd say overall the food was okay but the service made the experience worse."}
{"text":"Yes, I go here often.  This is an easy meal out with a variety of options and so far, all I have selected have been delicious.  I order gluten free as I have celiac disease and they always prepare my food safely.  A huge huge HUGE plus is that they have a dedicated fryer for their chips- so I can eat basket after basket after basket with their delicious and slightly smokey house made salsa.  I usually order the Marco Polo taco because, why wouldn't i? I often get another taco and the fish one is great as well as he classic beef one.  Their salad you can get is delicious on the side and the rice and beans are pretty good.   I like their margaritas and feel they are just strong enough.  Sitting outside is great and inside can be a bit loud.  Depending on timing, there can be long waits. I will keep returning regardless."}
{"text":"This use to be a fantastic place! I loved it, however with my most resent visit I can tell that something has changed and it wasn't good. The menus were different as well as the friendliness of the staff and the quality of the food. We waited for 45 minutes and my fries were ice cold and my black bean burger was extremely bland. It's so not what it use to be and that's so unfortunate. I won't be returning there are way better Mexican restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Food here is very good, about as authentic as your going to find in Charlotte. Try the tacos (the al pastor is pretty good) and the agua fresca."}
{"text":"The Pomegranate Margarita coupled with Cantina's chips and queso makes this one of my top destinations for pre-party activities.  Plus the ladies at the bar are super nice!  The place is always packed & the steak fajitas are a tried & true favorite."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for Mexican this is NOT the place for you!  Sure they have margarita's and even a few Spanish words on the menu but that is really where the similarities end.  I was there on a Saturday night and the place was busy, so that could be why the service was brutal- we had to ask for things multiple times before they came and the waitress wasn't familiar with the bar or even the menu.  As for the food I ordered a chimichunga it was okay but I wouldn't order it again.  It was as if they are trying too hard to make it different, if that's the case the succeeded.  However, I think they should have focused on making it better."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Went here for a work dinner, and started off with a Mojito. Handmade in front of me, very good. Non of that pre-made mix crap!  Salsa and chips are excellent, we did not order appetizers though the guac, and croquets sounded amazing!  I ordered a steak burrito, with the queso on top...Um muy bueno! The burrito was warm, with a thick tortilla, and I was surprised to even find peas in it! The queso on top was a lovely creamy addition, and there was plenty of side items, lettuce, tomato, guac, sour cream if you needed them. Also on the side was their coleslaw, this stuff is amazing, I absolutely loved it.  I will definately be back soon!"}
{"text":"The waitress is friendly.the food its ok the reason for 3 star after i order tacos the food take 35 minutes ta get in my table. I will back again for second chance"}
{"text":"Seafood tacos with peanut sauce and fish tacos with tartar sauce were great. Service very friendly and attentive. Definitely a jem!"}
{"text":"Authentic? Not so much. The atmosphere was cool and modern. Nice seating areas. However food was definitely not authentic. Good guacamole and chips... if I had to go back that's all I would get."}
{"text":"Rea Rad  location has insufficient parking forcing valet parking. Enchiladas Rojas are barely edible. Food over priced. Waiters push margaritas as if they were made with gold. This restaurant is all marketing/ brand  hype with forgettable food. Why is there not a \"zero star\" rating?"}
{"text":"The food was so bad! I ordered two guacamole bowls, and it tasted like someone dumped a load of salt into both of them!! I also ordered the chicken chimichanga. It was full of black beans and little to no chicken at all!! Not to mention, the guacamole sides that came with the chimichanga was so small (maybe a pinch of lettuce and a teaspoon of the tomatoes). Compared to the CANTINA 1511 at the Park Road Shopping Center, which is great btw, this restaurant drops far low beyond the \"restaurant acceptable\" range. If I had to say, McDonald's or a Chinese Buffet would probably be better than what I experienced/ate at the Cantina 1511 at StoneCrest. Never going back here again. Waste of my money. I could have gone to the Nothing But Noodles or ChickFilA across the street and actually enjoyed my food. We took a to go box home only to have it thrown away."}
{"text":"Barbacoa is Fantastic! cevichie/ cheese dip are wonderful! Everything I have tried is excellent!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for lunch or dinner, but their brunch - yes i was shocked too - was delicious!!  Service is quick and easy - thank you Melina V.! The food is wonderful and usually has you asking for a box. Great spot!   Best tip about this place: get the table side guac - superb!"}
{"text":"I guess this is my first yelp review!  Ok, so the food is good and the prices are slightly steep for a Mexican restaurant.  It has a nice modern atmosphere and not your neighborhood Mexicans restaurant feeling.  Overall I gave them a four star because the food could have tasted better and not so blah, and the prices are too high for most things.  Would I go back? Yes nit my first choice though."}
{"text":"Good food. Good drinks. A little pricy. Chips and salsa were great."}
{"text":"Great food & service! Stan the manager was the best! Love the southwestern chicken salad!"}
{"text":"Unexpected but Cantina does a fabulous weekend brunch! The new location is stunning and the patio is great in nice weather."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant, hands down. I was a frequent customer at their previous location and appreciate the increasing in parking spots here! This was the place that showed me that avocados really are amazing.   They consistently deliver delicious dishes regardless of what I've ordered. Always go for tableside guacamole, or if you're feeling cheesy: the queso is tasty as well.   Service is pretty consistent regardless of how busy it gets. It might just take a little longer when it's packed... like any restaurant.   My usual order is either an ancho chicken burrito or 2 tacos with rice and beans or the chopped salad. Favorite tacos include: al pastor, ancho pollo, and crispy shrimp BLT. You cannot go wrong with ancho pollo, I promise!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food with a Gluten Free menu for wifey!"}
{"text":"I hate to come off as a prude and I apologize in advance, but I too am very critical of mexican food. Cantina 1511 is much more about ambiance and being seen/seeing people. Its a trendy resturant but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Service here is good and they have a multitude of drink selections, sangrias, margaritas etc.  On my last dinner visit I had the special, chicken enchilada suizas. It was not very good. The sauce was a watered down green mole and the enchiladas were not cooked to a perfection. They weren't buttery flaky and didn't melt under my fork. The chicken was bland, it just tasted boiled. I can say that Azteca has a better version of enchilada suizas.  Not a deal breaker, as I do like this place. Next time I'll just have to try a different dish. Great chips and salsa though and after work drinking here is a must!!!"}
{"text":"A few months ago we visited this restaurant for dinner, weren't impressed, and I wrote a less than positive ( but accurate ) review.  Last night we decided to stop by again for cocktails and an appetizer. We sat at the bar - and left feeling completely satisfied. The only reason I'm not giving them a full 5 Stars is because we didn't order a full meal. But the guys behind the bar ( Julian & staff ) did a great job, we got our appetizer in a reasonable amount of time, the staff was friendly, our drink was good, and overall we left very pleased."}
{"text":"We showed up about 10 minutes to closing and they still seated us and did not give us any problems.  The only problem is we had to order our drinks right away for last call. We did get the guac made at the table.  It was good, but didn't have cilantro.  But it had a bit of spice which made it delicious.  Chips and salsa come with the table. We actually ended up getting an assortment of plates and apps family style between four of us.  It worked out pretty well.  Their house fundido was amazing.  I don't even remember what was in it, but it was a great mix.  Got a couple of tacos and a quesadilla as well.  All in all, the food was tasty.  The place has a bit of a classy feel, but not like you have to dress up.  It's a nice decor with good lighting."}
{"text":"Have never had bad food here. I was sad that the Maverick margarita was off the menu, but the bartender came through with an equivalent margarita."}
{"text":"By far one of the BEST Mexican hot spots in the Carolina's!!   The Margarita's are fabulous, and the table side guacamole has the kind of flavor that is a \"close your eyes while you eat good\"!!  We love their taco's especially...and always have to have the chipotle ranch. If I listed all the dishes that are our favorites... I may end up listing the majority of the menu.   We are not big fans of the dessert selections, but because our meal is so great...we are normally too full to go there anyhow (dessert)  For lunch I really enjoy the \"chopped salad\"...and talk about great Mexican style  c o r n....roll it a little in the chipotle ranch and you will be in flavor heaven!!  We eat Cantina 3-4 times a month....I would love to suggest frequent patron card..so those of us that are regulars could get a free appetizer every once in a while!! :+)  I do not know Frank (the owner) personally....but what I do know is that he has great restaurants in Charlotte....   Mama Ricotta's Big Daddy's Burger Cantina 1511   ...and soon to add a Taco spot somewhere near South Park Mall."}
{"text":"Oh Cantina! I am so shocked I haven't reviewed you yet! While I would simply love you for your AMAZING and fresh guac, you have so much more to offer. With Mexican, I am not hard to please, but I have never been let down my Cantina.    To begin, the decor mixes traditional Mexican style and chic modern flair. The lightening is at the perfect level so you can relax and truly enjoy your meal.   I have always had great service and when in doubt a tasty lime margarita and the Marco Polo Tacos will leave any visitor beyond happy and full!"}
{"text":"Just left Cantina, everything was phenomenal, from the service to the food to the margaritas everything was on point. Piper was our server and she was beyond great! She was very knowledgable and helpful as well as a sweetheart. 5 stars for Cantina! When you go ask for Piper!"}
{"text":"Cantina ranks up there in the places I like to visit along East Blvd.  While the businesses across the street tend to change out time and time again, Cantina seems to have weathered pretty well and has become a \"go-to\" staple for me whenever I am craving some good eats.  Recently visited on a Saturday for lunch and the crowd wasn't too bad.  They had streamlined there menu some and had a nice lunch menu to choose from.  I ended up having the Ancho Chicken Scaloppini & Cheese (Ancho chicken, caramelized poblano peppers and onions, melted Mexican cheeses) with a side chopped salad.  Dressing on the side, I only used about half of what they gave me but the salad was like crack and I could not get enough.  There were fresh avacados, chickpeas, jicama, greens, corn, black beans, and a whole lot of goodness packed into a small plate of salad.  The chicken on the sandwich was packed full of flavor.  My one comment was that some of the liquid from the chicken made the bread a bit soggy, but I powered through anyway.  The cheeses all melted in your mouth and I was stuffed in a good way for lunch that day.  I know this place is pretty popular in the evenings, but the one thing that I do get annoyed with is the parking situation.  It's great if you live down the street and can walk, but unfortunately the parking lot - they have done the best with what they have, but I do feel awkward parking in front of employees cars (double parking) but I think they do valet too so they can put your car wherever.  The patio is pretty amazing when the weather is cooperating.  And no visit to Cantina 1511 is complete without some tableside guacamole."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on a trip. Food is good and reasonably priced. It is gringoized which isnt bad just more mild than true mexican food. Great patio area and friendly staff. Solid place to eat!  Presentation of dishes is really nice too."}
{"text":"I keep coming back here because I love Mexican and it it so close to where I live, but I never leave here completely satisfied.  The food is good but not always seasoned properly.  The pastor and carnitas have not been as flavorful as I would expect and the barboaca was way too salty the one time I got it.  The wait staff is friendly but seems to rush you out and can be forgetful at times. The layout is unique with a bar/lounge area and also has a front porch seating for when its nice out.  This is one of the best spots for Mexican I know of in Charlotte. However, I prefer their sister restaurant Paco's Tacos as far as the food goes. The salsa verde at both restaurants is banging!"}
{"text":"Sub par experience. Asked to be seated in a booth, the gentleman at the door said he didn't have any available - the restaurant was half empty. Now you're telling a guest they can't sit where they want to. Who trained you? So once we sat down I asked the server if I could move to a both, she gladly show use to a large booth. I didn't mind being sat at a six-top both because I had originally asked for a booth. There was a six top sat beside us. I guess since they all ordered drinks our two-top table was obsolete. Good thing I don't work in food and beverage to notice these mannerisms. My beer took almost ten minutes to hit the table and I never got the green salsa which I requested as soon as she greeted the table. A really tall gentleman came by because I think the server might have picked up on my frustration. He brought out the salsa!! The queso is always great and I crave their green salsa - these two reasons alone is why I thought about going. All my previous experiences have been fine but they were also at the bar."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in Charlotte!  The service and food were exceptional. It was some of the best salsa we've had, and the enchiladas were very flavorful."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night at 8pm while the restaurant was very empty. Waited for a server for 15 minutes before going to see the hostess to ask if she could send a server over. 8 minutes later and still no server so I went back to the hostess again to tell her we were leaving. I had heard great reviews from friends about Cantina but after last night being my first time there I will never go back. Plenty of servers walked by while we were waiting but none stopped to ask if we were being helped. Completely unacceptable!"}
{"text":"My husband brought me and my mom here for Mother's Day lunch as this used to be one of my favorite places as I loved their drinks. He made reservations almost a month in advance. When we arrived, there was an abbreviated, pre-fixe Mother's Day menu, which we were not made aware of in advance.  I was a little disappointed that I could not get the Barbacoa I'd always liked so much. We were initially a party of 3 and my son said he couldn't make it so we went ahead and ordered our food, After waiting a really long time and no food, my son suddenly appeared. We put in an order for him as well. After waiting another excruciatingly long time, a server appears with a plate of food. ONE plate. It was the dish my son had ordered. He arrived about 30 minutes after us, and got his food first. Since it just so happened that he and my mother ordered the same choice, he gave the plate to her so she could start eating as the server promised that the rest of our food would be right out. However, at the time that she FINISHED her plate and the rest of our food hadn't been brought out, I caught the eye of a hostess checking tables (as our server was nowhere to be found for long periods) and asked her to please check on the rest of our food. 5 minutes later, the rest of the food comes. My fajita platter - which was some dried out chicken and mushy peppers and a single flour tortilla, was cold. Not even lukewarm, but cold. I immediately had to flag down another hostess, again, our server was elsewhere for long periods, and asked her to get me a manager. Manager comes, apologizes for the \"kitchen\" mixup and says he will remake my meal. FIVE MINUTES later, I have a piping hot fajita platter in front of me, this time with TWO WHOLE flour tortillas. Yay? Nay. While it was hot, it was bland and unseasoned. Not sure how tex-mex ends up unseasoned. We were all so disappointed with this experience they completely ruined my mothers day luncheon. We are not interested in returning here again. Not even for the drinks."}
{"text":"Been there twice. Loved it both times. Great drinks! Busy but great service. In a good area. Tasty food."}
