The decor is modern, staff is super friendly too. I love their coffee too"}
{"text":"Whenever a shop logo displays EXOTIC, that's a natural sign for curious individuals that are looking for some excitement in their life.  I'm no different.  I enter D'Rollz Exotic, Fresh, D'licious restaurant which has an upscale atmosphere but a hybrid setup of both Fast Food and Full Service.  For decor please review to their Web photos.

I went up to the Order Counter to place my order and pay for my meal but as it wasn't busy at this time the friendly staff took the meal out to me as I sat at the High Stool area while overlooking a group in their Round Booth and above them CP24 on LCD.  It was quite CHILL here that you can bring your daily newspaper and sit comfortably and listen to FM91.1 JAZZ.

The have individual items or you can do combinations but either one it's usually around a $10.00 meal.  Items such as D'Crisp(Lumpia Goreng), D'Coconut Thai Green Curry, D'Soto Soup.  A light Menu so you don't have to make infinite decisions.

D'Crisp(Lumpia Goreng) otherwise know as Fried Spring Roll is full of Bamboo Shoots and pieces of Ground Chicken which makes it juicy as bite into it.  Quite long in structure like a Cigar.  Dip some Red Chili Sauce or the suggested Green Jalapeno.  A-OK

D'Soto(Soto Ayam) is Yellow Spicy Chicken Soup.  This version of Chicken Soup has elements that change your typical Chicken Soup flavour profile.  The Dry Shallots, Dry Onion and a bit of Turmeric give this some EXOTIC addictive flavours while the White Meat Chicken, Potato, Bean Sprout and Glass Vermicelli complete this item.  Matza Ball Soup better step back.

As I saw a couple gentlemen enjoy their Lunch time Beers, I decided I should one-up them because that's what I do.

D'Marble Pudding with Creamy Rum Sauce.  I could smell the Rum in the Cream Sauce covered the Marble Cake that is Pudding consistency with the White while having random Dark pieces of Cocoa cakey flavours.  Canned Fruit on the side of course.  mmmmMMMMM      RummmmMMMMM!   8)"}
{"text":"D'Lunch Specials! 

When I walked into D'Rollz, that 's the first thing I saw... Any rice based dishes for $7.99 includes a pop/water from 11 AM to 2 PM. Any lunch specials sounded good to me.... 

The outside of D'Rollz is really deceiving with all those food photos as decoration, I expected a dumpy takeout joint and I walked in I found a trendy lounge like environment.. not that I don't enjoy that.. I feel trendy and chic while I dine on some good tasting Indonesian food with my 2 lovely lunch dates! 

D' Coconut Thai Vegetarian Curry with brown rice 
- Though it is not on the menu, but my date always able to request vegetarian options no matter where..(maybe not The Stockyard..but they have fries?) 
- great mixture of vegetables, especially king oyster mushroom! 

D' Shrimp with rice 
- Really light in taste.. good compliment to shrimps which were cooked perfectly...to the stage of just barely cooked through... 
- sauce has a lot of dried shallots.. which give the shrimp must of the flavour 

D'Red Coconut Indo Chicken with Rice 
- Rich coconut based curry.. with a nice kick... 
- we requested extra spicy because the nice cashier said it not they are all prepared Canadian spicy = mild... 

$1 extra to add D'Crisp (Semarang style spring roll, made mainly from cooked bamboo shoots and chicken) which 2 of us opt for except our vegetarian friend. The main different from other spring rolls is that it was filled with bamboo shoots. BTW, bamboo shoots are high in fibre..which is much healthier than a meat based spring rolls. 

After reading Wayne C's review, I was all excited to try out their D'Pudding... and so sad.. it is no longer on the menu.. why? why? I WANT my Ruummmm Pudding!!! The staff said no one is ordering it, aside from Wayne C, so they took that off.. now they only has: 

D'Coconut Custard Tart ($1.49) 
- Not to be mistaken with the Egg Tart that I usually has.. the tart is more like a coconut sponge cake make into a tart shape and topped with some toasted coconut bits.. 
- Tasted quite good and we all enjoyed that! 

Now every Saturday, D'Rollz will turned into a Live Jazz Venue..now that's sure sounded like a great place to bring your date here to enjoy some good food, good music for a reasonable price!!"}
