{"text":"I'v been going here for 30+years.  The food was pretty good, but do you have to be rude to work here?!  About 5 coworkers and I went for lunch and our waitress was so rude!  We scratched this off the list of places to go."}
{"text":"A hidden gem!   Phenomenal service, incredible food, all in a historic building with lots of charm.   Ample parking is available in a large, free lot.   Sure, the surrounding neighborhood isn't exactly great, but that's not the restaurant's fault.   We will be back."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had! We went to Silvestro's on October 8, 2016 for my father's 75th birthday. When we arrived at 6:15pm there was a line. The owner Jerry greeted us and told us it would be a little bit. 40 minutes later we were finally sat. Next to the women's room. A girl brought us water and bread and left. 15 minutes later our server came by and asked \"What do you want to order?\". Didn't introduce herself or give us any specials of the day. Before I ordered I asked everyone at the table if they wanted drinks since our server didn't and that is typically the first thing you are asked at a restaurant. Before I could finish, she interrupted and said very rudely, \"I will get to the drinks!\". I ordered my meal and a tonic water with a lime. Our dinners came with salads and my aunt asked for her dressing on the side. 10 minutes later our salads came out and it looked like the bottle puked salad dressing all over my aunt's salad but our server disappeared so quickly we couldn't say something. I also still hadn't gotten my drink. Another 20 minutes and our food arrived. In mid bite, our server grabbed my father's salad plate and asked if he was finished! Still haven't gotten my drink. Finally, half way through my dinner our server brought my drink and I noticed something in the ice. Her response, \"Probably just a fruit fly.\" When I was about finished my replacement drink arrived. Our server never asked how anyone's meals were or ever asked if anyone needed anything. When she brought the check I was just coming back from the restroom and she spilled water all over my chair and jacket. No apology. Only a \"I hope I didn't get his jacket wet.\" My jacket was soaked and it was a cold evening outside. Didn't even completely dry my chair so I had to stand. The only upside to the whole evening is that the food was very good and very large portions. I do not recommend going here. You can get the same quality and portions of food at places that give you much better service. And since I do restaurant fire and safety inspections I know plenty of other places to go. My next message will be to a health inspector to see what can be done about the fruit flies!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was cozy and enjoyable. The service prompt and friendly.  Our salads were fresh but the house dressing was a little oily and without much flavor.  My Lake Perch came hot and crunchy but a little bland. My broccoli steamed perfectly.  My husbands chicken parm was small and smothered with a ton of cheese. The rigatoni was tasteless with a bland marinara sauce.  It was OK but pricey and we probably will not return."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. No elegant, relaxed, quiet ambiance here, Just great food with more than adequate portions served by friendly staff. Veal Silvestro is superb and keeps me coming back year after year."}
{"text":"Very good food and generous portions. Cash only, small dining room and they want you to leave right after you eat. There's no lingering after your meal. Always busy in there! It's a diamond in the rough for Lake Co."}
{"text":"Back in the day this was one of my favorite places to go for prime rib. They still give you a monster sized bone in piece, but it is always cold in the center. And forget it if you want rare or medium rare as the best they will ever have is medium.   You still get a lot of food for your money, but I wish they would make the prime rib like they used to."}
{"text":"I love anything authentic!  The Depot Café is definitely authentic from the décor to the drinks to the food.  As soon as you walk through the door you know they have been doing this successfully for years.  The menu is traditional steaks, seafood and pasta. Think shrimp cocktail and whiskey sours.  The portions are large. The atmosphere is comfortable casual. This is a family owned business that has been around for generations and will surely be missed if they ever decide to close.  So much tradition in the setting and menu.     FYI - my server informed me that they only cook the steaks medium or higher, never bloody.   They do it their way!"}
{"text":"Our 1st trip to Silvestro's. I have lived and worked in the area for 6 years and my son tipped me off to a place to take my wife for dinner out. I had never heard of it. It's so tucked away and upon arriving we said to ourselves..\"Really?\" It's a family owned restaurant/ bar near the old railroad depot on a dead end street. It looks like an old house from the 60's. ..and still cash only..large portions, Very good quality..I had a Delmonico with butter and mushrooms...Excellent..I had to take half home.... My wife had the Fillet Silvestro with lobster on top of the medallions. The menu has seafood..clams, mussels, lobster, steaks and classic Italian dishes. It's the kind of place franchisers would love to duplicate...but can't because it's one of a kind...A lot of locals.. we will be back.. It gets s3 tars because it's an Italian joint that serves large portions that fill you up and you take half home. If you want truly fine dining,  Gordon Ramsey style try somewhere else. If you like large portions and good food with ok service this is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Every time I walk into this place, I am reminded of so many great memories. As a kid, I remember I loved the half order of spaghetti and a meatball. I recall that the co-owner, Lucian, would walk around singing Louie Prima's \"Just a Gigolo\" along with the jukebox, greeting every family, and laying candy bars beside each kid's plate. The other co-owner, Jerry, would be cooking with the kitchen door open and whistling loud enough that you could hear it throughout the restaurant. As I grew up, so did my tastes, and my goto dish was the rib steak with a side of spaghetti and mushrooms. All this time, the house dressing has always reminded me of something an Italian grandma would mix up in her kitchen. As a man, most of my visits are now lunch time stops for the perfect prime rib sandwich or gravy covered roast beef sandwich and fries. And there, in the center of the room, the Budweiser Clydesdale wagon keeps spinning, as the Tribe game plays over the door, and suddenly I am eight years old again and the food is just as great as it was back then."}
{"text":"What a huge disappointment. I remember my parents eating at this place for years when I was a kid, and I'm 40 now.  Started out ordering bruschetta... No balsamic glaze. Stuffed peppers were just okay, pretty bland.  We also ordered shrimp cocktail, again just okay ( I love cocktail sauce, and just tasted like ketchup). My girlfriend ordered filet mignon, that was absolutely tasteless. $28.00 for 2 bites.  I am a huge pasta and meatball fan.  The sauce was just tomato minus the flavor. The meatballs were tough, and tasted like they were made with bad meat. Honestly. The price is way too much for the food. Even the presentation was a wilted lettuce leaf... I truly looked forward to an amazing meal here, we left here very dissatisfied with the flavor, presentation, and overall experience. We will absolutely not return."}
{"text":"Been going here for over 25 years. Best steak house around in my opinion. First visit I got the king cut prime rib. Wow never could finish it that evening, but the next morning I'm gnawing on that rib bone like a dog. Finally tried the Boston strip king cut and now that's my go to. From the start with the fresh Italian bread you know it's going to be a great meal."}
{"text":"We were in Painesville buying a Tall People Tub and decided to find a restaurant nearby.  Jackpot!  My parents took me to an Italian restaurant in Richmond every weekend.  It was like walking into my childhood.  Eggplant Parmesan is my favorite and OMG do they do it well!  Not everyone does!  The portion was so big I ate it for three meals!  Service was great!  The soda glasses were a throwback and quaint.  I will go back!"}
{"text":"Simply cannot recommend The Depot more.  When first dating my husband we came here a lot - we came here the night we got engaged - the day we found out we were finally pregnant - the day we got a sitter for the first time in two years for our twins...notice this place is a biggie for us.   Here's why - the owner Jerry and his staff are polite not clingy, know the \"bests\" to recommend, don't try to \"sell\" you on things not quality or just to raise a tab/bill. They know their red sauce is worthy of a last meal status - their rigatoni and meatballs - epic and I know how that sounds but try it and you will be a believer!   The filet Silvestro is a five star specialty, the Romano filet and shrimp pasta is fabulous, their bruschetta is delicious, the pink lemonade (sorry pregnant) is yummy as is the jack and coke the hubby says (yes full bar).    They have fresh bread (I believe from T&T Bakery down the street) and a perfect house dressing for their salads. I do wish they offered wedding soup (as their huuuugggee meatballs are so good I would love to indulge in tons o little ones!) and that they would bring back desserts - I mean what's the best meal twice - two times the love!   This is a classy casual place so it's fine dining while not making you uncomfortable shoved into Spanx, don't know why I love it so much! On the classy note I didn't take photos of my food...just know you cannot go wrong.   The rock shrimp - killer, the prime rib queen cut - falls off the plate, the eggplant parm perfectly crisp and not soggy, the appetizer stuffed banana peppers - will leave you wanting more!"}
{"text":"So the good: Food is really good. We ordered lasagna and rigatoni and the lasagna was amazing!!! I love ricotta cheese and this had a perfect amount! It was great. Rigatoni with meatballs was really good too.  The bad: We were greeted and told a table would be ready soon. No name taken, no other acknowledgment. After about 20 minutes, we were sat next to the restroom, which thankfully, no one used. That table is usually gross and never wanted. But the real kicker: that table was empty the whole time we were waiting! The owner was clearly hoping we'd go to the bar and get a drink. When he realized that wasn't going to happen, he gave us the worst table. Maybe it's just coincidence, but people who were at the bar got much better tables and we came in before them.    Our meals came with salad and bread. Our salads were not like everyone else's? The table next to us had great looking salad with cheese, tomatoes, cucumbers, oliveS, and carrots. Ours had one olive on each and a cucumber. Plus, the bleu cheese dressing is not good. Not only do you have to pay extra for bleu cheese, it literally tasted like sour cream and mayo with one blob of bleu cheese mixed in.  The service is quick, but most of the staff seemed unfriendly and bothered by our presence. One girl (a young girl) brought us drinks and bread and we thanked her each time, and she totally ignored us. Now, I'm not asking for her to be my best friend, but a simple smile or thank you would have gone a long way.   Another note: this place is not wheelchair accessible. Just something to know if you need."}
{"text":"Was told they have best prime rib around, Queen size was very large and very expensive IMO $27, Prime rib was fair at best, was very disappointed in it. Salad and spaghetti were very good. Service was very good. Place is very small and loud, was somebody's house at one time. Parking lot seem to be mud rather than paved."}
{"text":"As hot as it was today, hubby treated me to some eggplant parm. (Maybe it's the Italian in me???) I've never been here before, but it was really nice, cozy and dark...a nice contrast from the inferno outside. The building itself had a great vibe, with lots of history to it. The service was prompt and courteous. My only complaint is that the side salad that came with the meal was really lack-luster. Just basic iceberg lettuce mix and a slice of cuke. I think a little more effort with the salad would go a long way, especially since they talk up their own house made dressings. The portions were huge and moderately priced. About to eat up some leftovers! Would return again."}
{"text":"Great daily specials Monday through Friday. If you like variations at your go to dining establishments then the Depot Cafe at 470 Railroad St.  In historic Painesville is for you. The Italian bread baked locally has the perfect amount of \" chew\" . The eggplant Parmesan is just the right texture and nice portion size. Friends come in from Virginia just for the prime rib served nightly. A beautiful old fashioned bar on one side and family dining on the other. Take the brick paved road to the family run restaurant."}
{"text":"Been going here for over 45 years and have never had a bad meal. Everything from their steaks and lobster to their Italian specialities are fabulous. Generous drinks and very pleasant staff and owner."}
{"text":"Went there all the time as a child. Great food! Newsflash! THEY NOW TAKE DEBIT CARDS!! This was a game changer for me, as now I didn't have to make a special trip to the ATM...  Oh yes, the food. On point as usual. T&T bread, good salad, huge portions. I had the veal parm with rigatoni. The wife had lasagna. We both had enough to eat for lunch the next day! Do yourself a favor and go there. Went at 530 on a Friday nigh, and there was only 1 open table."}
{"text":"Having been a customer here for the past 15 plus years, I'll have to say that I was more than a little disappointed with many aspects of my last dining experience and I thought Jerry needs a big heads up. To begin with the first girl to serve us was very  pleasant and poured us water while we waited for our waitress. In addition, the bartender was also very pleasant beforehand. When the waitress arrived she was not very friendly. Not sure what was up, but she seemed to be slightly uptight.  We promptly ordered drinks and entrees with salads. When the salads arrived they were mostly the white parts of iceberg lettuce. The dressing was mostly oil. We had ordered Italian dressing.  I would suggest using greens and lightening up on the oil in the dressing. The bread was a bit dry, not what I remembered usually getting here.  The entrees were the usual fair that we always remembered. When we finished, the waitress brought us the check and when she returned I had placed $100 cash to pay the $81.00 check. She then proceeded to ask if I wanted change. This floored me, as this was more the 20% of the check. She not only gave us lousy unfriendly service but she had the nerve to ask if I wanted change. Wowwww...  I know her to be a past waitress from 15 plus years ago. I remember that she had a look alike sister that worked there as well. Possibly a twin.. Not sure of her name, but definitely not pleasant in nature with alot of gull. Hopefully, things will get better at the Depot or I for one will not be returning. A shame for a restaurant that worked hard at one point to be a place to come to to enjoy a good meal, sadly to fall into disarray."}
{"text":"First time here, Unbelievable delicious! Highly recommended! The atmosphere was wonderful as well as the waitress and bartender!"}
{"text":"Was the first restaurant I ate at when we moved to Ohio from Chicago as it came highly recommended.    The atmosphere is darker and comfy.    The service is friendly and welcoming.  The food is amazing, the portions are HUGE and you leave satisfied.  Every time we go, my husband and I order the queen cut Prime Rib and it's enough for us both and we still take 1/2 of it home.  It's absolutely the BEST Prime Rib we've ever had."}
{"text":"This is a very nice, historic restaurant in Painesville. It's full of history and character. The food was good and prices were not bad. We especially liked their spaghetti sauce... It was on the sweet side and full of flavor.   I'm a big bread fan but their bread service was average.   Overall, we really enjoyed our time here. Service was great. People were friendly. I'm sure we'll be back!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite \"date night\" places to go. Awesome food and service, but plan to wait in a small area for a Friday or Saturday night table. Quick service - everything on menu is delicious!"}
{"text":"Neat little neighborhood bar located across the street from the old Depot on Painesville. I've been here a couple of time, and my parents are frequent visitors. Both the Mushroom and French Onion soup are worth the trip. There are a variety of different types of sandwiches. Everything we ordered had a generous portion size for the price. The thick sliced Italian sandwich bread was great. I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Never go here. The price was too high for the Blandest food I have ever had. The fries I had needed to be saved by A ton of ketchup. No salt nothing. The prime rib was seasonless. Taste like something I'd feed my dog. In my Togo box they placed my steak on my bread so it was wet. Never again never ever ever. Not worth the money nor the time."}
{"text":"A trip back into time! (Think \"Good Fellas,\" the 40s, your parents on a first date) There's nothing from the outside of this joint to even cry out \"restaurant\" (upon leaving, I did see an unlit sign out front)...you almost feel like you are entering someone's house. But it is indeed a bar/restaurant, and it is obviously a very local haunt. And yes, clearly Italian: dark, with lots of red and dramatic Sinatra playing. A bar with red soda counter stools. A smoky kitsch atmostphere without any attempt at kitsch or smoke. And the food? Overwhelmingly meat and pasta and seafood and not subtle at all. The red sauce was very rich with meat and oil---I could not finish the enormous portion of rigatoni with meat sauce. My aunt had the seafood platter which she deemed adequate and large (mostly fried things). Most people seem to leave with big doggie bags. There is simply nothing for the vegetarian or even the slightly healthy eater! Even the bread is odd, a bit like Italian wonder bread with tabs of butter. But I left full and would return, now understanding what I am getting into. In other words, the place is full of mood and character---the food is almost secondary. I would try the lasagne next and judge from there. I can also picture and taste this dish now...good but DAMN HEAVY.  Silvestro's seems to be a place where you can fill your stomach pleasantly and also learn about who lives in the Painesville/Lake County area (one hour east of Cleveland). It's in a (formerly) industrial part of the world, and the food seems fit for the hearty manual laborer after a long day. You can mull about the world we live in now, the world of strip centers and \"fine dining\" that are actually large corporate chains. Silvestro's reminds me of Spirito's in Elizabeth, New Jersey---and there are fewer and fewer of these places left. I'm sure that they existed in most working class communities, where profits come from servicing a loyal, select audience rather than advertising and killing people with glitz. I found it quite refreshing.  Our meal cost $40 including tip. My aunt had a glass of house wine. Dinner comes with an average house salad and the aforementioned bread. There is a working class, casual atmosphere. Service was prompt, friendly but things seemed a little rushed. I think that they assume that most regulars know what they are ordering and then just hang around forever, talking. We ate and left quickly, being from a totally different planet! I'll hang out longer to dig the ambiance next time.  Note: Silvestro's does not take credit cards. There is an ATM machine near the bar."}
{"text":"I honestly wasn't expecting it to be this good. I had heard it's great but I was skeptical since there were no reservations and I heard they didn't accept credit (they DO!)... it was fantastic! Bread is served cold, not hot. We had the stuffed hot peppers for an app, seeds not removed so they're pretty hot. They could've been stuffed more (only half) & I personally prefer marinara and cheese, but the flavor was great! He had a prime rib with a lobster tail, ordered medium rare, if you like it like he does, order it rare... it was slightly over done for med rare. I had the $24.95 rib steak and it was HUGE! Fleming's Gorgonzola cream sauce is my favorite and silvestro's had a Gorgonzola butter that was comparable... and delicious ! Every steak gets sautéed mushrooms too. For the money, absolutely a five star! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite area restaurant!  The steaks are wonderful and the menu is very diverse.  I noticed that other people complain about the staff trying to turn over the tables as quickly as possible -- we understand that and are fine with it.  Our server (we always ask for the same one) knows exactly what I'll be ordering, since I never vary my selection from one visit to the next.  I recommend the filet mignon with a side of spaghetti!  We've never had even an average meal at the Depot; their food is always superb."}
{"text":"I work in Painesville and The Depot is one of our favorite lunch spots. They finally accept credit/debit which is great. Prices are very fair and food is traditional and well made. They do get you in and out of there quickly. Love the history and the fact they've been part of the community for a long time. I had a burger last time and it was cooked to temp perfectly and wasn't a premade frozen patty. I've had the roast beef open face sandwich before as well and it's very good and a good value considering the portion size. My friend had the eggplant parm and a chef salad and he said they were both good \"comfort food\". Will be going back many times."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for our date night. We were seated right away, in a cute little two person table with a candle. Hostess came by with bread and water right away. So far so good. Our waitress came by and from the minute she was at our table I could tell she was in a rush, which really isn't her fault but she took our drink order and then after we ordered our meal. I had the filet mignon and my boyfriend had the king cut steak, which is 2 lbs. (Fyi, it was HUGE. He ended up taking it home.) Both of our meals came with a side we could choose from, and she listed them off like she was working at an auction. I could barely comprehend and asked her to repeat them and after she did I got so nervous I just chose the redskins. My boyfriend did the same.   It took longer than normal for our food, luckily we had the bread and our salads. My filet was dry and not good, at all. Not worth the $26. It came with a huge piece of lettuce on the side which to me was pointless. The redskins came out and they were three boiled red skinned potatoes. I ended up mashing mine and adding butter and salt and pepper, however, both my boyfriend and I were under the impression that they would be roasted of the sort. I do know that my boyfriend did enjoy his king cut steak. At least one of us was happy. The waitress came around every once and awhile but couldn't even stop at our table to talk to us. She rushed by and said, \"everything good?\" ...didn't even give us a chance to answer.  Our bill was $72. It tasted more around $40. If we ever go back, I think I'll go with the pasta."}
{"text":"Went there a couple nights ago and it was just as amazing as it has always been. Food was great and so was service. I've been coming here since i was a kid and it has never disappointed. The portions have gotten alot smaller and that kind of hurts but that's business. Overall my favorite restaraunt to go to. We loved it"}
{"text":"Place came highly recommended. Great cozy atmosphere. Food portions where huge device was quick and polite. Would recommend to anyone. Truly a hidden gem."}
