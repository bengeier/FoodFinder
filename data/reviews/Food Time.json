{"text":"AMAZING FOOD!!! We ordered the BBQ Platter and it was heavenly! The serving is huge and the order comes with Salad, Biryani Rice and 4 large Naan. The most and the best, by far, Pakistani/Indian dish we have tried!!! Great food, super friendly service and value-for-money meal! Will highly recommend to family and friends!"}
{"text":"Best butter chicken, fresh naan, chicken biriyani ever!!  i have gone to my share of restos and this place is a hidden gem!  Highly recommend!  They also sell samosa's indian pastries etc.!  Busy place but this show how good the food is....wait time is at least 20-30 mins for take out....but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Family special for 4 is my go to meal here with my family of 6. 4 adults and 2 kids. The food is enough. The taste is great. Biryani kebabs and Nihari. I'm not a big fan of chicken jalfrazi so I substitute that for an extra Nihari. 

Good service And the food is just amazing."}
{"text":"The place is hiding in a plaza near Brock and Kingston road at Pickering. We were kinda late and planning to get some take out. We got Bihari Kebab and Lamb Karahi; each of these two items came with free nun and salad. The Kebab was a bit dried, but spicy and tasty. i wish it was a bit juicy. However, the Lamb Karahi was top notch. There were enough pieces of meat with nicely cooked curry. Loved it! 

The service was good, the lady who took the order was nice and friendly. The price is reasonable. We actually had to wait quite long to get the food, but the best part was the foods were freshly cooked. I will definitely go back to this place."}
{"text":"The manager here is very rude.. I bought 4 box of lamb briyani Yesterday. And three of the family mamber was sick the next day. When I call them today just to tell them to be careful next time. Inserted of telling me sorry the manager start talking rude. I am a chef too and I don't want free stuff. Will never go back again. Or introduced it to anyone"}
{"text":"Customer service is awful. Called to place an order and was asked to wait 2 mins which led to the person hanging up. Called right after and they didn't answer. Called for a 3rd time only to be asked to hold again for 5 mins. After 10 mins, they ask to call back in 3 hours instead of just taking the order and asked me to take the business elsewhere...

Food may be good but attitude needs some checking. Will not be going there."}
{"text":"I take out halwa puri from this place first time and I can say they are pretty quick in their service and food quality and quantity is great."}
{"text":"So I was visiting a friend in Pickering and she wanted to take me somewhere and I insisted on a desi place because I was in the mood for desi. Ended up here around 3pm. The outside looked horrible.. but sadly that's how half the desi places look.. so I ignored it. 

I ordered a sweet lassi and when the girl brought it, it was tasteless.. so I asked for it to be made more sweet... she in turn said that we put a lot of sugar, then turned around and gave me a sugar pot!!!!  We ordered a chicken biryani.. it was mild in spices, so a solid 3/5. We ordered 3 chicken boti naan rolls as well... they were HUGE in size, case as 6 pieces, took a looooong time coz they were grilling them fresh. Tasted superb! The accompanying chatni (the green one and the tamarind one) were extremely watery and tasteless .. so I stayed away from them. 

So yes, food was decent... then why did I give them only 3 stars? Because.... 

Ambiance: 0/5 
Bathrooms: Filthy! 

But most importantly, the (lack of) customer service, unfriendly server who actually looked at us from head to toe before serving (we were in skirts!) was a complete turn off."}
{"text":"For the record: this restaurant's name sucks. But don't let that dissuade you too much.
They're a relatively cheap, tasty place to grab some food when you've got a craving for Indian in Pickering. Their chicken biriyani is great (not overspiced, with a good amount of meat) and they have a great chana masala. I've tried a few and they usually make my stomach churn a few hours later, but Food Time's was pretty good.

On the negatives: service is EXTREMELY slow. I did a walk-in once and - OH MY GOD! - never again. I think it took about 30 minutes to actually get my food. I ended up sitting in my car in the parking lot because it took so long and I didn't want to wait in the store and end up smelling too strongly of Indian food.

Always call ahead and place an order for pick-up, if you can. I've never had sit-down service at this place, so I can't speak to that."}
{"text":"Don't go by the ambiance, food is awesome! Being a vegetarian, I was circumspect about having Veg Biryani, as I thought that I might be served fried rice. But this was the best VEG biryani I have had outside Hyderabad(India)."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant with delicious and good food, with such a fair price. Hygienic as well."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Pickering. I almost missed it while trying to find this place. 

I went in for take-out on a Saturday evening. The place was packed, both dine-in and take-out. I didn't call in ahead so it took about 20-25 mins for my food to be ready. 

I ordered nihari (Sat special), paai and veal karahi plus a couple extra naans. Everything was fresh and delicious. The naans were fluffy and soft as well. The prices were reasonable. They actually gave us a lot of meat in the containers. I've been to other Pakistani places and those places usually give you more curry while skimping out on the meat. I was pleasantly surprised. 

I really recommend the veal karahi, so good! I can't comment on the customer service since it was take-out. But the staff seemed polite and nice. Would definitely recommend this place for take-out. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"What can I say - still as good as ever.  Just had the Thursday special the chicken Kahari is phenomenal (off the charts) - the dish is deliciously spicy on the right level and Food Time have hit the dish on point with its spicy taste and usage of capsicum and other freshly ground spices (sure you wait for the food here ...but that is because it's FRESH)!   They have hit this Pakistani and North Indian dish special to the max.  We also had the the other Thursday special the Lamb Biryani (amazing as Food Time Lamb biryani meat and rice are cooked separately before being layered and cooked together and the taste of flavours meld maticiously) .  I have lived in Dubai and also the UK...and Food Time is better than all the places I tried in the Middle East (which is no small feat considering all the Indo-Pak places there in Dubai)....... it is consistent to my favourite Pakistani Curry house in UK ...

Food Time you done it again - you are the best"}
{"text":"The food is good for the price you pay for it. The butter chicken is kind of watery compared to other places but it is still good, just not much flavour. They also keep the fat on the chicken which I do not like."}
{"text":"Food Time is close to home, making it convenient to grab some good tasting Pakistani food on the fly and at a very good price. Although they have a dining room, I've only gone there for takeout.

I've tried several of their more popular dishes, such as Butter Chicken, Tandoori Chicken, and others but I usually get the Chicken Biryani, probably their best selling dish. For only $5.29 (takeout price), you get a generous serving of well seasoned fluffy basmati rice, a couple of pieces of chicken, and a small side of raita (a green yogurt sauce) to cool the palate.

Good food, good value. I don't think they have any dishes over $10.00."}
{"text":"We get takeout Chicken Biryani from here all the time! Their Raita is the absolute best!"}
{"text":"Love this place. My favorite is the Chicken Biryani. We always order the family special for 4 people even it's just the two of us ."}
{"text":"Best and tastiest food! Very very poor customer service. Most of the staff rushes and are actually quite unfriendly, and kind of rude, but i just deal with it because the food is top notch! Also a good tip is to order your food in advance. Sometimes if you order the special which most people do, I notice they might give your food away if you take to long to pick up or they give it to someone else if your ahead of them. Sometimes it works in your favour and sometimes it does not and then your waiting an additional X amount of time to get what was supposed to be your food. Tge food is good here they often run out of the specials. Over all amazing food and probably the best ...but the worst customer service i have ever dealt with in the food industry."}
{"text":"In terms of authentic Indian food, if you are not Indian this will be the most authentic you will have ever had and full of natural spices and flavours - may be a little spicy for many.  If you're Indian then this is still regarded as one of the best places in Durham to go to.

We had seekh kebabs (beef and chicken), chicken korma, chicken biryani, mixed daal, and naans.  

The pricing is pretty good at $36 for all of the above and naan is included at no extra cost.

Downside is that they include whole spices both in the rice and in their kebabs so you will be taking a bite and crunch into a big peppercorn or clove etc - you have to be on your toes! 

Other thing is even when you call ahead with take out they can be really delayed - we were told 40 min but had to wait another 20."}
{"text":"We've done biryani to go for years randomly. Mainly because we live down the street. It's very flavourful and not too spicy"}
{"text":"Been going here for the last five year and I love it! Easily the best east indian food in toronto. The price is reasonable and the food is tasty. These guys take forever to get your food ready so call in advance. I spoke to the owner about the time and he told me since they make everything to order, it takes a long time. Makes sense to me....I would rather wait than eat something that's been sitting in their fridge all week. 

Butter chicken, chicken  biryani, the fish are so good here. I ordered from here last week for a party of 25 at home and they did a awesome job getting the food ready on time and it was more than enough. 

5 star!!"}
{"text":"Great place for takeout and catering. Not so much for dining in. The biriani was very flavorful. It contains a lot of rice though and not enough meat. 
The place gets quite busy on the weekends. It's better to call ahead and order for takeout."}
