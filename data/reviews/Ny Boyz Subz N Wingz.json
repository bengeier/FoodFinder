{"text":"I tried going here on my lunch yesterday (6/5/12) for the first time and in the middle of the day the lights were off and the doors locked. No sign was on the door indicating if they were just closed or if they went out of business. I was kida disapointed.....so I went somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"NY Boyz has the best steak sub, the best wings, and great service. I've gone in several times and have never been disappointed with the staffs recommendations. The owner, Jordan, is usually there with a great smile. He just recently won Wingstock wing challenge and once you taste his wings you'll know why."}
{"text":"I come here all the time for the best wings in az but I had one of Omar's burger made from fresh premium ground beef and it was phenomenal! Gotta try!"}
{"text":"I love their pizza! Their service is great, a real personal feel to it. They brought out some delicious chunky blue cheese dressing for us to dip our pizza in and OMG! I crave their pizza all the time and hate that I don't live in Tempe so I can't satisfy my craving. A most go place for new york style pizza."}
{"text":"There its no wing in Arizona that comes close. None. There is a reason this place took first place at Wingstock. And the sandwiches are stellar too.

Someone complained about a rude employee. Number one, deal with it, its called NY Boyz, not Polite Vermont Boyz. But if you're a stickler, you'll be happy to know that new owner Omar lovers his customers and is polite as they come.

Seriously, quit screwing around and give them your business."}
{"text":"Worth the wait.  They probably have the best wings in town.  They also have really good sandwiches.  So why not 5 stars?!  Well it took me about 20-30 minutes for my food.  The good thing though was that I was prepped in advance by someone who had eaten there before.

I am an AZ native so I have been brought up eating Ranch dressing with my wings.  Blue Cheese was never ordered when I got wings.  However, Ny Boyz makes their own Blue Cheese dressing and it is the stuff from Buffalo not some cheap knock off in a bottle.  The wings are cooked fresh, not par cooked and then reheated like many places around town (I see you Native New Yorker).  These guys also care about the food they are cooking and the quality shows.

The people that gave this place 1 star should be ashamed.  If you don't like the service fine, but to not give credit to their great food is an absolute travesty.

This is a hole in the wall joint, you will probably have to wait for your food, I would skip delivery, but if you are wanting some really good sandwiches, and awesome wings Ny Boyz is for you."}
{"text":"There wings are probably the best wings I have had :) The chicken hoggie and steak hoggies are my all time favorite though! They saut√© banana peppers and mushrooms with the meat and some tasty sauce, it's so good!!!! Try it out!

The owner is super nice and very accommodating!"}
{"text":"So today was my first time here and...IT WAS GREAT!!  Had the Chicken Souvlaki Sandwich.  Delish!!!  They have great specials every day.  Think this is my new favorite.  Wing sauce awesome too!!  Think I will have to try the wings next time.  Great NY atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Food was very good, bread was awesome.  I was the only one in there and then about 5 more people walked in after me.  Guy at the front counter got very flustered and it took forever for our food.  He needs to settle down and this place would get 5 stars."}
{"text":"only place in the phx area i could find that has the ghost chilli pepper wings. holy smokes they were hot!!! the register guy bet me that if i ate all 12 i would get em free! he kept his word after i finished the last one. i pretty much had to drag my wife in there because of the location but now she keeps asking when are we going back. BYOB though!"}
{"text":"Friend and I were in the mood for pizza and wings, he said he liked non chain places and at the hotel he was staying at they referred us to NY Boyz. The shop is simple; you see everything he is doing. The owner is really cool. This isn't fast pizza by any means and  is  ordered in one size and that being LARGE,  He hand tosses the dough and puts the fresh ingredients on the pizza, we ordered sausage, pepperoni and mushrooms and we ordered some mild wings. The wings were tangy and favorable and finger smackin good!  The pizza crust was delicious and the pizza is huge, get a box because you won't be able to finish it all.  Glad to have stumbled upon NY Boyz and plan on making a trip back to try out their other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"NO B.S. No homo but for real this dude can cook. Jordan, thats whats up. You have got to try his in house made blue cheese. I dont even like blue cheese but his.....WOW. Some of that horseradish mustard to top off a bomb azz sub. Fish Fry Fridays here i come"}
{"text":"Do not order from this place, no matter what the reviews are.  The person taking orders on the phone said, \"I got the Yanks game on now...know what I mean...so ya know what you want LADY or not!\"

Please put them out of business and don't take their abuse."}
{"text":"I have been coming to NY BOYZ for the past three months and everything that i have eaten thus far has been amazing. I have ordered the chicken souvlaki salad, cheese steak sub, chicken finger wrap, turkey sub, tuna sub, greek salad, chicken wings: lemon pepper, hot, mild, barbecue, and honey mustard. My favorite thus far is the cheese burger sub which was recommended by the chef and owner, Jordan Ali, which was a favorite of his own growing up as a kid in New York. Let me tell you the sandwich is hands down the best sub I have eaten. That cheese burger sub along with the zucchini fries is a must try!! The items on the menu are made with simple ingredients but are top quality and veggies are cut fresh daily which is impressive and what all of us as customers want in our food. I also have to mention the customer service is outstanding. You must meet the chef/owner behind the kitchen counter cooking his heart out while mingling and being personable to his customers. This place is a hidden gem and I am so glad I have found it. If you are looking for awesome food available 7 days a week til late and that also delivers...say no more this is the spot to call. Now I am gonna print out this review and commentary so I can get my free drink or chips the next time I go to NY Boyz : )"}
{"text":"I wish I could give it zero stars. This place just got on Grubhub so I decided to give them a try. I ordered online at work at 4:25 PM. I got an email back from Grubhub confirming the order for delivery by 5:25 pm.

At about 5:20 pm I received a phone call from Mario at NY Boyz. He said there had been a delay and my order was going to be late. He assured me that my food would be there by 6 PM.

It was not. The food never arrived and they never called me back. I was at work and my shift was over at 8 pm. As the food was over 2 and half hours late at that point, I just assumed it was never coming. If a delivery guy showed up after that, I am sorry you wasted a trip."}
{"text":"I love this place. It was recommended to me by a customer where I work and he warned me prior to going that I should be prepared for a wait. I talked my boyfriend into going with me because he loves wings and I love pizza. I was not disappointed.

It is a HORRIBLE location they are in a hole in the wall right next to this sketch auto shop but I decided to brave it and I am so happy I did.

The guys who run the place are super friendly and I truly believe it takes so long because they actually care about what they are making. They went out of their way to recommend what they believe they make the best and to see that I was comfortable. I am not a blue cheese fan but theirs is homemade and it is something you should not walk out of there without trying.

Every time I drag my friends to this ghetto little pizza place they end up craving it and asking if I want to go back. 

I only give it four stars because they need to move to a bigger and more affluent area of Tempe. If they were walking distance from ASU they would be making bank."}
{"text":"NY boys is an amazing restaurant. The wings are the best wings I have ever had in my life. I don't like blue cheese, but they suggested that I try theirs. I still don't like blue cheese, but I will order their blue cheese every time I go."}
