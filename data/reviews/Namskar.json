{"text":"3.5 stars, but i always round up :)  we ordered the bite sized samosa appetizer (very good!), a spinach potato dish (forgot the name - sorry i was a little drunk), a diced chicken breast in spicy red sauce dish (forgot the name again - okay so i was pretty drunk), and the lamb curry (this was the best dish we had). obviously we got a few orders of garlic naan bread and some saffron rice. overall i was impressed with the quality of the food for a neighborhood indian food joint. full disclosure, as i'm sure you've already figured out by now, my senses may have been slightly distorted by the amount of alcohol consumed prior and during dinner (the girl in our group ordered an \"indian martini\" to drink - basically a martini with mango juice in it). they offered a couple different kinds of beer and some wine - all in all a sparse booze collection , but it still did the trick quite nicely.  by the time we had finished eating (we had to eat early in order to make our ice skating reservations - no joke, that's what canada's like!) the place has gotten pretty lively and full of customers (some indian) - always a good sign!  three of us came here and ordered a combined: 3 main dishes, one appetizer, 2 naan, 2 rice, and 3 drinks. we left completely full for $90 (plus tip).  i'm not sure what the indian food is like in the rest of calgary, but by san francisco standards, i wouldn't go out of my way for this place."}
{"text":"Fabulous food - The seating could be expanded a bit to accomodate larger parties and the parking area could use an expansion as well."}
{"text":"I often visit this great restaurant where we generally get great service and delicious food.  We have guests from out of town that have this as a mandatory dinner spot whenever they come to visit.  As a vegetarian, they have a lot of great options but my favorites are the Dahl Makhani and the Vegetable Jalfrezi.  The naan is always fresh and the chai is spicy and inviting."}
{"text":"I ordered my food from Namskar.  I told him I wanted 5 naans.  He told me 10 mins.  When I arrived there I see people waiting for there take out and left and we were still sitting there and no one was seeing if the food is made.  It was more than 40 mins.  Finally the food was done while I was paying for my food I couldn't read the receipt because he wouldn't let go of the package thinking we will take it with out paying for the food.  We took it home and there was only one naan and not five.   No meat  in the butter chicken and no meat in the lamb curry either.  I was  told that the food is vegan I don't know about the rice if it was vegan or not,  but man was my stomach ever hurt , it usually hurts me if there is meat or diary in the food.   I will not ever go there again because the food was late and they skipped out on the meat and naans I don't know what they were saving the meat and naans for.  Worst performance ever to when we were waiting for the food."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time about a week ago.  The service was great!! They went out of their way to seat us as soon as they could with no reservations.  The food was amazing.  I had the beef vindaloo and it was so good as was the garlic naan bread.  Would definitely go again.  The only weird thing was that you had to pay for drinks and food separately and their tip machine didn't work - so bring cash."}
{"text":"I came here for the all you can eat lunch buffet and I was excited because I love Indian food! It is only $16.95, which is pretty reasonable for all you can eat.   They had an assortment of food. I had some rice, naan bread, assorted vegetables, and of course, butter chicken! I personally love spicy food and I found the butter chicken to have no spice to it at all, which was disappointing, but it was still very good. The sauce that was on the assorted vegetables had some spice to it so I dipped my naan bread in that! For dessert I tried their fruit creme, which is basically assorted fruits with a mango sauce on top, and that was yummy.   The staff are very friendly and the restaurant itself was very nice. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Food is way overpriced especially for the quantity and quality they offer. We ordered the garlic naan, butter chicken, veggie samosas, veggie curry, and steamed rice. And it came out to $50 for everything.   The service was decent. Nothing stood out.   Everything lacked flavour compared to other East Indian restaurants. The garlic naan had big chunks of garlic which is weird because I couldn't taste any garlic. The outside was crispy but the inside was tough. Veggie samosas were decent the outside shell was nice and crispy flavour was ok.   I am most disappointed about the butter chicken. It lacked flavour, had zero spice in it, and the chicken was dry.   I would not come here again and I would not recommend it to anybody I know."}
{"text":"Food is usually good but the last time the service was horribly slow! It would be a solid 4 star for every visit prior to the latest visit  Food and service was lacking."}
{"text":"The place itself was nice, clean, very comfortable and the people there were very friendly. When ordering it was recommend getting 3 dishes and sharing between each other. First we order some apps (Namskar Veggie Platter), it tasted good but the portions were small but since we only had a small group of 4 it was more than enough. If you have a bigger group you will need to order at least 2 platters. Next we order 1 Butter Chicken, 1 chicken Jalfrezi and 1 Roganjosh (goat) to share. We also order garlic naan and Kesari Pulao cooked with saffron. The 3 dishes we order looked like small portions and we were a little concerned it wasn't enough but trust us it was. The butter chicken was nice and not too creamy, the Jalfrezi had a kick for all of you people that like spice and the Roganjosh was good (If you didn't know it was goat you would think it tasted like roast beef almost). The rice dish Kesari Pulao that came out was on a big dish and more than enough for 4 people. The garlic naan was very soft and good.  As for dessert...we were too full to eat anything else which was surprising.   As for the price it was very reasonable. If you are with a group expect to spend just over $25 for your meal and if you add dessert about $30 total per person.  All in all our experience was pleasant and service was good. Our rating is 4 stars out 5."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant - I never dine there, but I get take-out a couple of times a year. Their kadhai paneer (chilies, green pepper, tomatoes, onions and paneer) is the most AMAZING dish I've ever had. All I can say is that the quality of food is always consistently high and the food is generally wonderful... if you aren't too keen on sitting in the restaurant, call ahead and get take-out and enjoy their lovely menu at home!"}
{"text":"I went to Namskar with a large group. A few were vegetarians, so the group ended up ordering several vegetarian dishes and shared amongst the table. I'm not a vegetarian, but let me say that the food was excellent! I prefer eating some type of meat with my dinner, but I was thoroughly surprised with what was offered. The Khumb Muttar Paneer was my favorite dish, I highly recommend it for anyone intending on dining at Namskar.   The restaurant had a nice quiet atmosphere. The service was average. And parking was not difficult to find. So I would say that Namskar overall is a good place to dine if you are going out with a group or on a date. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love eating here, the food is so good. can't tell how many times I've been here. The service, food and prices are all great. They have really good prawns, naan, and other dishes."}
{"text":"The owners are actually from Europe (with an Indian background) so I dunno how really authentic their food is as I have not yet been to India.  However, having lived in the UK where there's an abundance of good (and equally bad) Indian places, Namskar is probably one of the best in Calgary to represent that style of cooking.  The best deal is probably their lunch buffets, a bit more limited selection but what they have is done very well.  Dinner is best but I agree that their prices are a little higher than other places with portions lacking slightly.  I'd have to rate Clay Oven and Namskar as my go to places for Indian of all the places in Calgary."}
{"text":"Easily the best Indian food in Calgary.  My gf is Vegetarian so it is a giant pain finding good food we can both enjoy.  So Namskar is a godsend!  We have had good service in restaurant, although we usually go with take out.    Take out is ready in less than the quoted time quite often, and almost never longer.  The food is always awesome, and the portions are very good for the money.  We usually have left enough left overs for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"This place is great. Good for pick up and eat in.   A lot of really nice texture and flavours. The Saag Paneer is lovely."}
{"text":"Came here on a saturday. It's not crazy busy which is nice so it's quick to get a table. The food is good but is quite expensive. We got the butter chicken and lamb vindaloo. You get a small bowl of each for almost 18 bucks each."}
{"text":"Great service friendly staff. The portions where small but delicious. Rice left something to be desired but overall great experience."}
{"text":"I had some really great take-out from Namskar earlier this year.  In fact, the food smelled so good that I sped home to eat it... and got a photo radar ticket in the mail a few weeks later!  I ordered my standard vegetarian takeout order: vegetable samosas, palak paneer, aloo gobhi and dal masoor.  Oh, and some rice of course!  I had a friend over for dinner that night and then I ate the rest of the food as leftovers: these dishes provided enough food for four large meals.  Everything was nicely seasoned, fresh-tasting (and fresh-looking!) and just plain good.  I will definitely continue getting take-out from Namskar in the future.  You can also eat at Namskar, and I'm sure they have a buffet (maybe at lunch?).  My one annoyance would be that their website opens with a painfully slow welcome video, with no option to skip it, so I'm not going to bother checking to find out details about eating in.  You can visit their website yourself to find out!"}
{"text":"It's much too expensive for the bland taste and terrible service from the owner.  The butter chicken tasted like it came out of a jar.   I went there for the lunch buffet. I had to rush to an emergency having only taken a bite from my plate, the owner refused to let me grab something on the run and charged me the price for the whole buffet.   What a ........"}
{"text":"Consistently excellent food and service with a great atmosphere. Best butter chicken I've had in a long while, and the malai kofta is great too. We always order one dish per diner plus naan (the garlic is excellent if you want to spring for it) and saffron rice. We've tried the pakora too and it's delicious. I've brought people here for their first time eating Indian, as well as people who are curry experts, and we always have a great time. This will always be my go-to place for Indian!"}
{"text":"Truly awful, service was poor, staff unfriendly, not recommended, pretentious management, slow to serve, walked out  only gave a star so could post and warn people"}
{"text":"Namskar used to be one of the best Indian restaurant for buffet. They used to brag about 19 items and quality used to be excellent.  I have been coming to this place for over 15 years.  While I cannot comment on their dinner menu, the buffet has become extremely bad.  The quality of food has become subpar.  There was very limited choice.  Even the Naan did not have the same freshness taste.  At $17 for the buffet, it is one of the priciest Indian buffet in Calgary.    Now that there are many more Indian restaurants in every corner of calgary, it does not make any sense as to why this old Calgary restaurant would let their quality slip.  The food was bad enough for me to never go back to this place.  That is unfortunate considering it is still owned by the same family."}
{"text":"I didn't know you were allowed to substitute rubber for chicken!  The chai was very nice, the sauce for the butter chicken was very nice, the naan was very nice.. but honestly, if you're going to charge me $16 for butter chicken, could you at least buy grade-A chicken?  I love Indian food and if I go back, I'll opt for the paneer makhani.  I would go back if they had a thali (assorted mini-dishes) plate."}
{"text":"I am an Indian food lover.  My recent visit to Namskar with a couple friends, didn't disappoint!  My friends had never had Indian food before and they choose this restaurant.    The place itself has a great decor.  The area we were sitting in did seem to get pretty packed, but it wasn't noisy.  The waiter was friendly enough, but seemed to be rushing us in making our decisions, so I just ordered for everyone.  We had one vegetarian dish, 3 meat dishes, roti and naan and each couple had their own rice.  The servings are small, but each dish was enough for 4 people if you don't hog it all.  The food was very fresh and not, not greasy, the meat was tender.  The bill including drinks was about $50 a couple.    Namskar is a nice dinner out, its a bit tough on the wallet for the portion sizes, but trust me you will be full none the less!  I highly recommend giving Namskar a try!"}
{"text":"The food is good but they either leave you on hold so long that you give up or they don't answer their phone at all and you leave a message that isn't returned. The online ordering option also isn't very useful because the system doesn't work well and then I'm reluctant to enter my credit card number into such a shaky system. Oh well..."}
{"text":"Authentic-seekers be warned... this place serves British-style (I would call them Western-style to be honest) curries. Naan bread was flat and uninspiring. Price was somewhat expensive for what you get. Not sure If I'll be back."}
{"text":"Namskar never fails to deliver delicious food and great service; truly sets themselves apart from other restaurants. My favourite dishes to order here is Daal, Lamb Masala, Butter Chicken and of course their Chai yum!  I've never had to wait to be seated, sometimes it feels like it takes long to get the food, but its always because I am super hungry by the time I get here! haha  I've been eating here since 2005 and the quality has never changed but the service has consistently improved.  I'm a regular at Namskar, for good reason!"}
{"text":"Went here for the lunch buffet and everything tasted much the same. Extremely mild spicing across the board, very heavy on cream and oil. Being a lover of Indian food and having travelled to India I couldn't be more unimpressed."}
{"text":"I checked out a few Indian buffets in Calgary. While Namskar does not have the greatest variety, they do have the highest quality. Best butter chicken in town!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is located in a unique building on 16th Ave. Ambience is better than most Indian places in town and service is also fairly efficient and courteous. I am yet to try anything bad on the menu - some dishes fairly good, others average but I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. Prices are on the upper end of the scale but they don't skimp on portions.   Personal favs are Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Kadahi, and Daal."}
{"text":"Namskar is the cream of the crop of Indian cuisine in Calgary. The combination of delicious food and terrific service in a friendly casual atmosphere makes this my favorite stop for Indian cuisine in calgary"}
{"text":"This is my new favourite Indian delivery place. It's a little more pricey than the other Indian places but totally worth it. They have online delivery ($4!) through SkiptheDishes and I've never had any issues with my order.  Firstly, my current favourite dishes are: the peas and mushroom rice, butter chicken, garlic naan and the vegetable pakora. But... they are so good that I have to admit that I haven't tried too many other menu items.  What I love: - The chicken is really good chicken breast quality and I'm never scared of getting a grissly bit. - The sauces - I could just eat the butter chicken sauce and rice. If I had to. - The garlic naan. Seriously. I currently buy as many pieces as I will have individual meals from my delivery. I've been reliably told that the cheese naan ($7) is not as good as the garlic naan ($3).  A cold or rainy day and need some comfort food? This is a great option. The website says 30 - 60 minutes for delivery and you can track the delivery which is super handy - it usually takes around an hour from experience."}
{"text":"This is pretty much my favorite restaurant. I've found pretty much everything I've ordered to be excellent!  I generally get the Butter Chicken but I've also ordered the Chicken, Beef and Lamb Vindaloo, and the Chicken Tikka.  Their garlic naan is perfectly chewy and the pakora (both chicken and vegetable) are amazing.  They are also very consistent.  The food is always good and, to date, I have never had a bad or an off meal.  When I eat in the service is always good.  The staff are prompt and very friendly.  When I get takeout, my food is always ready on time and I've never had them mess up my order."}
{"text":"I Was extremely disappointed. I got butter chicken, rice, and garlic naan. The butter chicken tasted like tomato soup with boiled chicken plopped in it. The rice was rice (hard to screw up). The naan was undercooked, pretty much still dough which was sad.   The delivery guys (2 of them) were polite and the guy on the phone was nice, but that was the only good thing going for them."}
{"text":"Namaskar is one of my local favourites. Unfortunately my experience this time around was not the 4-5 star I have come to expect from them. We were a party of ten with reservations. Service was slow and disorganized with no one serving water or checking on drinks. We ordered appetizers and they were served promptly but no serving plates and we had to ask for it. The butter chicken was too sweet. The other items we ordered were palak lamb which was okay and not outstanding as we have come to expect. The naan bread and tandoori roti were cooked well and we enjoyed them.  Namaskar veggie mix and veggie Manchurian and chilli chicken were below average in taste and freshness. I wanted to provide feedback to the owner but he was not around that night. Sad to see the food quality drop in one of my favourites."}
{"text":"I have been to Namskar twice, and I have to say I'm a fan!  The first time we went here was for a staff lunch so we did the buffet. The staff were super friendly, answered all of our questions and when we asked about dishes they weren't offering in the buffet that day - but were on their menu - they said we could phone ahead next time and they could try to add some different items in to try. Um, amazing service, non!? This was over the top, in my opinion. The buffet was perfect for us, lots of choices for everyone and the dishes were yum. Their pakora's are a bit different than I am used to, but delicious none the less. As we were leaving they also gave us each a buffet punch card, where you buy a few (I forget how many) and get one free. If we worked closer I could see people in my office taking advantage of this.  The second time I tried this place was for takeout. We specifically wanted a goat dish and chose one off the menu (I forget which one!?) and some garlic naan. It takes a little while to get the food, but after digging in - I have no problems waiting for quality eats! Our food was amazing, the naan was hot and fluffy even as take out. We didn't even have a single left over and I will admit there was some plate licking going on (the joys of take out). In my opinion the take out or ordering individual dishes is the way to go with Namskar.  Review #6 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for dinner and I absolutely love it. The service is prompt and friendly. The servers are helpful with guiding you and have great menu knowledge. The vindaloo is definitely the best I've had in the city. I usually get it with goat or lamb but I'm sure it delicious no matter what meat you choose. The korma is also top notch for those of you who aren't into spicy food. Although people gravitate towards the garlic naan, because it's obviously delicious, I personally can't get enough of the buttered naan. It really is mouthwatering. The saffron rice is delicious and honestly some of the prettiest rice I've ever seen. Almost too pretty to eat but not quite. Literally everything I've had here was phenomenal and I always leave with a full belly and a smile on my face."}
{"text":"So at the end of our meal tonight, we had left overs and let the waiter know that we would like the rest of it to go. So I use the rest room to wash my hands, only to come back to a table with packing supplies left on the table. Hmm..a little bit confused I ask my parents if he expects us to pack the food ourselves (as a joke). My parents said he took the plates and left these here and didn't say anything. So I ask the waiter and he says..\"Yes. For hygienic purposes.\"..umm WHAT?...So are you telling me that you are not hygienic enough to pack my left overs? Because you've been serving me this whole evening and now I feel like gagging if that's really your excuse..  Mind you I'm not from Calgary and am only in town for a visit but never have I ever seen this before anywhere I've been.   None the less, I did pack the food myself and inquired about it right before I paid my bill. Waiter said he was new and wasn't sure. I asked if he had confirmed with a senior co-worker. He said no and invited a co-worker to join the conversation in which I was rudely confronted about the dilemma...So I decided to turn the other cheek, pay the bill (with $0 tip of course), politely said goodbye, and decided that I will never come back here ever again.."}
{"text":"Enjoyed some beautiful take out from Namskar.  Vegetarian Dal is excellent.  Had some curry coconut prawns that were to die for.  The butter chicken was superb and the lamb Lorna was savoury but a little too spicy for my liking.  Recommend the saffron rice as well.  Delicious.  Generous helpings.  The service for take out was very attentive.  I recommend Namskar."}
{"text":"A customer of ours is located in Calgary -- whenever we visit, this is a required stop for us now -- the coconut rice is FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"My experience last time here didn't meet all the hype I heard, so I'm glad I had another excuse to revisit.  This is a great place if you have a large group (10 or more). They have a basement that you holds over 30 guests. This is a good place to keep in mind for your larger events.   The food was ok. The portions area plenty. I left full, but my curry tastebud wasn't satisfied. The service is hit or miss. The servers rotate around throughout the night. One moment we had a pleasant gentleman, the next impolite."}
{"text":"It's official: In terms of Indian restaurants in Calgary, Namskar is my favourite. Not to discriminate, but coming from a brown person, commenting on brown food, it's safe to say that my opinion on this holds a certain amount of clout.  The restaurant itself is better kept than a number of Indian restaurants in the city and the food is DELICIOUS. I could go there and JUST eat the milai kofta with naan and be one happy camper. Milai kofta is my absolute FAVOURITE thing and for some unknown profound reason, the milai kofta that Namskar makes tastes better than any milai kofta I've ever had. I also highly recommend the mattar paneer and the navrattan korma. Their onion naan is to die for, as is their laccha prantha.  For dessert, I highly recommend their ras milai. Their desserts are mostly dairy based so if you're lactose intolerant, you may have to stick to the gulab jamuns.  All in all, Namskar has delicious food, a welcoming atmosphere and great service. What more could you ask for? I salute you Namskar; Thank you for existing."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I have had in Calgary so far. Their vegetable kofta is to DIE for. Price is definitely not bad at all, and everything I have tasted here has been delicious. You can also tailor the spicyness level to suit your tastes! However, regardless of your adventurous spirit, refrain from asking them to make it 'very spicy'. They definitely dont hold back! I am speaking from personal experience here!  Service, however, could be better. Its a shame really, that I cannot give this place 5 stars. But the owner does need to take a genuine interest in his customers and not close the place down / send his waiters to pack away the chairs while they are still eating there.."}
{"text":"Food - DELICIOUS!! Service - great and not so great. I waited to be seated for 10 minutes while there were plenty of seats available because they thought I was picking up takeout, even after three people asked me and I told them I was waiting to be seated. After that, great service!   Lamb Korma and Chicken Curry were both excellent with Saffron rice. The garlic naan was also perfect. We also shared a mango lassie which didn't have enough mango, but we were given another one on the house on a second attempt.  The portions look small at first, but I definitely had enough left over for lunch the next day, and it was just as tasty as the night before!   Prices are on the high end of $$, about $30 per person with 1 dish, rice, naan and a drink."}
{"text":"About to eat here. Coming from North Americas largest Indian population in Brampton Ontario I am almost part East Indian. Let's see!"}
{"text":"If you want to try some authentic Indian food, this is the place. We went here for a causal dinner on a Saturday evening and ordered the lamb vindaloo, nan, tandoori chicken and saffron rice. The Lamb vindaloo was phenomenal and it is the most authentic vindaloo I have ever tried in Calgary. Even though it's spicy my boyfriend (Who is Canadian) absolutely loved it. We again went there for a lunch buffet, it was really good and well-priced for two people. I think it is 15 or 17$ per head and the place was crowded for the buffet. My favorite from buffet was the lamb curry, it was delicious. They are super friendly, all their food is amazing. Definitely a place to check out if you are an avid fan of Indian food."}
{"text":"this place segregates - it has two rooms one for whites and the other for indians...this is like the pre-democracy india.....also i think that the restaurant deliberately tries to scare non-whites away...."}
{"text":"Onion Bhaji's..nom, nom.  This is my go to Indian and they never disappoint.  Butter chicken is flavourful, creamy and with chicken that just seems to melt in your mouth it's hard to eat Indian anywhere else."}
{"text":"We traveled as a team of 20 people to Calgary and were fortunate enough to select Namskar as one of our meal options while there.   It was a very good experience for the entire team.  We were able to secure a private section of the restaurant for our group to boot.  Now onto the food.  It was GREAT.  We ordered it as a buffet style and everything was top notch.  Typically the team eats at an Indian restaurant each time we travel, and the food at Namskar was one of our favorites we've experienced.  The Naan is fantastic as was the butter chicken.    Namskar is a place we'll be sure to visit when we return to Calgary next year.  Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Horrid stuff pretending to be good Indian food. Not unlike at Rajdoot on 4th St. SW in Mission, the biggest rub is that these guys know what they are doing! But they also know their market: the bland insipid tastebuds of caucasians who haven't a clue about what is good food from any segment of the Indian sub-continent.  Perhaps the naan bread if hot would be okay, but by the time I got up to make another stab at this stuff, I became so disgusted that I quickly paid half-full, and almost ran out, never to return! Trust me, this stuff not only sucks, but they are deceiving the public into thinking their deception is okay.  Do you want REALLY good Indian food from owners and chefs who love their craft, and staff who will flex to accommodate any reasonable request?  Let me make some suggestions...? 1.  Ask your server to accent the spices without making it more hot? They will then understand that you won't settle with what they are used to serving caucasians, and will diligently work to satisfy you with flavour. 2.  Please take a risk, skip the butter chicken, and dive into wonderfully-accented aromas and flavours that will more than just tease your palate. 3.  To get a decent cross-section of reviews, go to the many other Yelp reviewers, as well as those in Google Maps and Trip Advisor. 4.  In general, it's quite possible to pay little more for great individual dishes that often are larger than your appetite, which means take-out for a couple lunches the next day averages down to about $12-15 per meal! Don't let inferior 'lunch buffet specials' trick you! 5.  In any ethnic restaurant, before sitting down, check out how many suitable 'ethnic' faces are in the place: too many whites could mean bad news.  Want quality, quantity and price...? 1.  Check out Raj Palace for excellent Tamil cooking from the southern India region where many of the best spices are grown. Out of the three Raj Palaces in the city, the one we've discovered as best is in Harvest Hills area, not far from Beddington Trail and the large C&C oriental asian grocery store. Any Chettinad curry, chicken tikka, tandoori Pomfret fish, and garlic naan bread will surely impress. 2.  Northwestern Punjabi? Try Mehtab in Cochrane for excellence. As with most dishes there, their vindaloos are delicious. 3.  North-central cuisine? Jaipur in Cochrane is highly-recommended and with other venues (Greek, Italian, Mediterrean) surely sets Cochrane off as a destination for great food. 4.  Northeastern style? Check out Masala Mantra on 11th St. SW at 12th Ave. SW. Never had such golden-yellow garlic naan before. 5.  Northern Indian/Himalayan? Try Himalayan on far-western 17th Ave. SW. Their lighter spices provide such diversity. With your meal try a quality basmati rice and an order or two of garlic naan, and prepare to be transported...  As well, all of these are more than good representations of their regions, and while getting to know the front and kitchen staff even by name will further confirm some of the hands-down best Indian cuisine in Canada.   But steer clear of Namskar, and Rajdoot. Even the 'butter chicken' in the buffet that I seldom eat tasted overly-sweet. And they can only continue to trot this bad to poor stuff out if ignorant people continue to buy it! I hate to see people waste money, time and energy on what they erroneously think is good Indian food...  Following the above suggestions, marvel at what good Indian cuisine is really like!"}
{"text":"People often complain that East Indian food comes in small portions but when the portions come packed with flavour it goes a long way. Namskar serves up some really good East Indian food. The only thing I've tried in the appetizers are the samosas and they come fresh, hot and crisp on the outside. a fairly decent size and in three's. They are not the best in town but they are good. Vindaloo is served non-East Indian level of spiciness, but still a nice heat. They will make it authentically spicy if you ask for it but I generally go with people who find that the regular vindaloo heat served up is good so cannot tell you what the real vindaloo-level version is like. I find the flavours of any of the dishes I've tried great and I've never not taken some leftovers home even though all we order is a dish per person with naan and rice. The naan is good but the last time I went it was a bit heavy. There is some parking behind the restaurant and on the side streets and though it is right on 16 Ave, I've never not found parking close by. Service is excellent and the place has a nice ambiance and not too noisy. There is quite a selection of East Indian desserts and in addition to the well-known Gulab Jamun & Rice Pudding & Mango Flavoured Ice Cream, they also have Ras Malai and Mango or Pistachio Kulfi. We tried the Ras Malai which is slightly saffron flavored, chilled homemade cheese patties in sweet creamy sauce with pistachio nuts  There wasn't a hint of yellow colour in the dessert so I'm not sure if there was saffron in it as I couldn't really taste any but it was delicious. There are 2 patties so my friend and I had one each. I would definitely recommend sharing as this is a delicous creamy dessert, not too sweet but very rich and I think having 2 patties all by oneself would have been too much. The coffee is some of the best coffee I've tasted and you get your own little teapotful of coffee, the first time I've seen it served that way!"}
{"text":"I took my daughter here on a lunch date and was pleased to have a nice, quiet, experience that also involved tasty food. It was the lunch buffet that can sometimes come at a really low quality but I was impressed by how often they topped up their dishes and how, even near the end of the buffet time, they still provided fresh naan and other staples. The service was prompt and non-intrusive, and my daughter was never left with an empty glass of water. The only down side of the experience was the rice pudding. For years I have made my own rice pudding and absolutely love the stuff, I found this one to taste merely like rice and milk. It lacked flavour, body, and mouth appeal.   All in all though I would go back for the buffet and will one day go in for the dinner menu to see what they have to offer."}
{"text":"Order on their website through their online order system which was \"down\" but  he said he refreshed his browser and got the order after 1.25 hours after ordering and was assured they would be able to get it to us in thirty minutes.  One hour later the delivery man showed up after hanging up on me two times as I told him where the building was.  This was after I called and cancelled my order around the 2 hour mark.  He tailgates into my building and shoved his foot against the door and was extremely confrontational had to tell him to take his foot out of the door as we had already starting cooking instant food.  Very disappointing experience but a culmination of failures from the ordering system which required me to prepay which might need more work on their side monitoring and using it properly.  The food is always good but the service was ridiculous for the price.  Bottom line is I don't order food to get harassed by the delivery man and come about five minutes away from calling the police or having to drag them out of our building."}
{"text":"This was our first time here!  The boys and I came in at 12:30pm and the place was packed!  It's a good thing we made reservations online. Our server was very pleasant and seated us immediately.  We wasted no time and ordered mango lassis-- yum...  they were thick, creamy and not too sweet.  Having just come off a ten-day diet (mostly veggies, fruit, nuts, fish, eggs, cheeses), I needed carbs...  badly...  !!   We made a mad dash to the lunch buffet (the a la carte menu is only available at dinner time).  I was pleasantly surprised that they also had a Greek-style salad (complete with black olives, sans feta) as well as the regular red onion and green lettuce salads.        The goat curry was absolutely divine.  The meat was tender and falling off the bone; it was bathed in a mildly spiced, flavorful curry.  However, I was fishing around in the chafing dish for more goat meat (there were mostly pieces of spine and neck bone), but I guess the kitchen had to use up all parts of their goat eventually...      Strangely enough, the naan (covered by a large cloth) was out on a heated tray at the buffet.  At most of the Indian restaurants we've been to, the servers brought out the naan separately to each table to avoid it drying out at the buffet.  Sure enough, the edges of the naan on top of the stack were curling a bit...        The cabbage and peas were delicious, and so were the masala turnips.  The butter chicken was meltingly tender and the sauce was seasoned perfectly. A white gourd curry was also available--I didn't get a chance to try it.  I also didn't have  room for rice pudding or fruit salad.  We will definitely be back sometime for dinner!  There are some great choices on their online menu!"}
{"text":"tandoori chicken was meh and |MEH meh meh.  The bad parts of the chicken served heaping with bones.  I imagine they use the good for butter chicken.   Veg Kora looked like store bought frozen pees and carrots in babyfood.   The mango Kafli and Lychi drink were meh.  2 mehs.  I WILL NOT BE BACK EVAR"}
{"text":"We went here for family dinner on a Saturday. We ordered their Shahi Paneer and Namaskar mixed Veg. Both items were very flat with very little flavor. Service was also average. Their prices although are one of the highest in the city. Our overall experience was much below our expectation."}
{"text":"I thought the food was great. I thought the price was reasonable. However, my service was not up to the standard I would have wanted. There was one main waiter and a couple of folks bringing out food, but the server was dramatically out-numbered.  My advice, anticipate your needs a bit further in advance than you normally would - unless they have an adequate staff on hand."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I came here on Father's Day.  I'm not sure if it's correlated but the service was so slow that day.  It took a long time for our appy to arrive and even longer for our entrees.  I usually order dessert but we had somewhere to be after dinner!  For the appy, we ordered the paneer pakora, which is home made cottage cheese fried in chick pea batter.  I usually love me some cheese pakora but it was rather bland and a bit rubbery.  The mint chutney that came with it sure livened it up.  For the main, I ordered the chicken lababdar while hubby ordered the beef korma.  They were very good in very distinct ways.  The chicken lababdar was similar to a butter chicken but with more spices and depth of flavour.  I wanted to lick the bowl clean.  The korma was a mild and creamy yellow curry which went perfectly with the garlic naan.   We also had the saffron rice.  Yum.  I'll definitely be back but I'll skip the paneer pakora next time."}
{"text":"I was there last week and sadly there was a big sign at the front door saying they were no longer going to open for lunch as of January 2016  another casualty of the recession.The buffet itself with  the exception of the salads was  dull in flavor, the butter chicken was on par with what you would have at co op deli.i have been going to namskar since it opened and it was one of my favorite haunts for lunch but no more."}
{"text":"The place was packed on a Friday evening and that is usually a good sign! Except that I looked around and I didn't see one Indian customer in the restaurant! I said to myself maybe it's just a coincidence! I wish that was the case!  The food is decent but not authentic in the slightest. A lot of the dishes are British style curries.   Vegetable pakoras were dry, the lamb was undercooked and the service was a little slow. The \"garlic naan\" was excellent though!   The waiter was very confident and asked us to compare this place with \"Mango Shiva\" and then asked us if we would come back here. He was really friendly and I felt bad for disappointing him!"}
{"text":"Would love to give this five stars - food really is awesome and very authentic tasting. Couldn't be happier with it except the Laksha Paratha which is thicker than a quarter pounder with extra cheese. But the veggie options and the daal makhani are excellent as is the tandoor roti.   Unfortunately the service is appalling. Downright rude, unfriendly and unhelpful. Well not totally. One of the three waiters was really nice, one was ok (but if there is a coat on the floor which you are stepping over there is no harm in telling the customer so she can put it back on the chair) and one waiter was downright hostile. Weird guy didn't even look Indian. Wasn't sure why he was there and the way he behaved, I am guessing he wasn't sure why he was there either.   Owners / mangers of the restaurant should have ironed out their service issues (they all seemed to be present at the restaurant) but they seemed too aloof to be able or willing to do so.   Conclusion: get home delivery and you will be in for a treat. Turn up and well...at the least the food will be hotter.   Oh it is somewhat expensive for what you get but personally I would pay the extra 25% for the food (to be eaten at home)!"}
{"text":"We went there on a Thursday night and as soon as I entered I was surprised by the crowd. The restaurant was 80% full which is impressive for a weeknight considering the fact that the location also does not attract a lot of walk ins.   We had the appetizer platter and the house wine to start. The house wine is terrible but I was not expecting anything better in an Indian restaurant. It was our own fault ordering wine, not a good pairing at all.   Most items on appetizer platter was tasty but my favorite was the Pakora. Very delicious and fried to perfection. Also it came with two dipping sauces/chutney which was fantastic. I am sure if they bottle them most customer will buy it on their way out.     For the main course I tried, the lamb Vindaloo and the Dal. Both of them were very good. However, the Dal was something special. Probably the best Dal I had in Alberta. I normally try to avoid vegetarian dishes but if every vegetarian dish tastes like this Dal, I may convert ;). Also on the side, we ordered saffron rice and garlic bread. The bread was freshly baked and tasty. On the other hand, the saffron rice did not taste like saffron at all. I really prefer the Persian version of the saffron rice which is more generous on the Saffron :D   I will definitely go back there to try other items on the menu but I am sure whatever I order, I will have the Dal also."}
{"text":"If you like Indian cuisine, definitely put Namskar on your list. I've been here several times for their lunch buffet, and I've been consistently impressed. As others have noted, food quality is beyond reproach, but parking is a challenge: their lot is tiny and neighbourhood restrictions can make finding a nearby spot iffy. Clean, bright, and moderately upscale."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Best Indian in Calgary for sure and we have tried basically every place in town.   Get the daal tarka & vegetarian korma."}
{"text":"Due to circumstances, I always expect Indian Food to be cheaper unless drastically varies from the traditional: fusion cuisine and the like. Namskar is delicious but it comes with a price tag for very good, very traditional food. You have your standard Kormas, Masalas, Vindaloos - only the quality distinguishes it from similar restaurants. I do think they are justified in pricing higher, but considering the size of the portions I always end up feeling a little ripped off (minus one star).  Everything truly is delicious. I haven't eaten lunch here, but it is an excellent dinner venue. It is classy without being overly formal, and the lack of a buffet is a good thing for dinner. The naan is delicious, delicious enough that I order a few to go when I eat there! The ingredients are all top notch, and the dishes well presented.   I recommend going in a group and eating family style to truly savour the excellent mix of spiced flavours that they offer."}
{"text":"Soooo disappointing. Considering the price is much higher than my normal Indian takeout, I expected MUCH better. Naan - greasy (but large) Butter chicken - flavorless and terribly disappointing. Vegetable korma - bland, lacked variety of vegetables. Beef vindaloo - not spicy at all, tasted like mom's beef stew.  I felt SO let down, becuase it's rated so highly. Even if it were cheaper, I wouldn't order it again, but every item was a few $$ more than any other place I've ever ordered from."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Their butter chicken is incredible. One of my favorite places to eat in the city!"}
{"text":"Namskar, you're the very first Indian restaurant in Calgary I ever ate at. You were my friend Ruth's favourite. Since then, you've been a pretty solid choice for me as well.  Great service inside, right on top of things for take-out.. You've got your game figured out.  Tonight, I popped in to grab some vegetarian friendly options. I love that your menu makes this easy to do!"}
{"text":"First off we had a gem of a server which always makes the experience that much better. The dishes were very flavorful. A couple downsides: chicken in the vindaloo was quite tough, the samosas crust was a bit to much like pie crust .  Awesome coconut rice and the best dang gulab jamun in the city"}
{"text":"Sunil! That's how this review has to start. He brought the flavours, the humour and the celebration even with our picky, confused and probably frustrating tribe. The menu is diverse enough to please even the most uncertain Indian food newbie and traditional enough to appeal to the true foodie (self defined of course). We had to wait - the restaurant lacks sufficient parking and speed. Perhaps due to the demand of the patrons and the desire for REAL food rather than fast food? I wish we had slowed our dive into our delightfully presented edibles because had we you would be viewing colourful choice dishes of vegetarian curry, butter chicken, scrumptious paneer, prawn korma, and garlic naan - served up classically in copper (?) dishes so beautifully you could practically smell the spices through the photos. Oh and I must not soon forget the triple heat of the chicken entree one of our party enjoyed. A jug of water unsolicited (but definitely wanted) and an unexpected birthday treat complete with song made this a special night and a special place. I recommend you visit, soon, and I further recommend you make reservations and say \"hi\" to Sunil. He is worth the drive - even from the SE!"}
{"text":"Most of the Indian restaurants in town are not bad, tend to make the same ol' stuff like butter chicken and so on as they specialize in northern westernized cuisine.  Namskar is no different in this aspect.  What makes them uniquely different simply that they are.  The food is made fresh, it's tastes better and the service is top notch.  Unlike many of the other places I've been in (yes, I'm looking at you unnamed place in Mission, other place on Macleod and especially now closed place on 36 St), I've never once felt unwelcome or even looked down upon.  If anything, the staff and the resto is inviting, the service is excellent and the atmosphere is... well... not perfect, but still decent (at least the music seemed right as opposed to Cirque de Soleil or Jack FM).  My only complaint was that the kid of one of the staff was running around in the place and it was a little distracting.  Restaurants are for the clients, not a day care centre.  I also had my first lesson in vindaloo... that is, there are definate levels of hot.  When we say vindaloo, we expect hot... but that's western hot.  You can actually say vindaloo vindaloo (double ) or just say hot as the regulars or so.  Now THAT's how it's supposed to be, with sweat pooling at my ankles as I struggle with glasses of water and plates of rice to try and compensate for the chili heat of the food melting large portions of my taste buds off.  They don't advertise it, but I saw it done, and was told by the waiter that it can be done and then warned me against it.  As each time I've been there so far, my guests are lightweights in heat, I haven't had the chance... but one day... ONE DAY.... muhahahahhhaaaaaa.... (whoops, losing control of myself...)  The nan is made in house, and a definate must. The only annoyance I have with this place is really just the parking.  As it's just off the very busy 16th Ave SE, you really have to park on a side street.  But that's just minor and barely worth mentioning.  Oh, and there's stuff for vegetarians of course.  Not being one myself, I have no idea how they taste, but fellow yelpers have said they loved it, so take a gander at their words of joy, pleasure and veggie love.

{"text":"Best Indian I've had in Calgary.  Their buffet was good but a bit pricey for the selection.  I wish they had Chicken Tika Masala on the buffet but the Butter Chicken was great and satisfied my craving."}
{"text":"Good indian food.  I had the shirmp korma and some delicious naan.  I would definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"I came here after much hemming and hawing about whether this place would offer a true east Indian dining experience, and although it was ok, it certainly wasn't authentic.  Flavours were totally muted and obviously catered to western pallets as the spice and heat were totally lacking.  Ambiance didn't really strike me as Indian and actually looked quite dated.  Service was adequate and nothing stood out to me as being spectacular except for the naan.  Parking lot is very small as well, so you might have to find street parking nearby.  Everything was just meh.  If you want true authentic east Indian stick to the deep north east behind Castleridge Safeway."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best indian food in the city!. The service is prompt and the food is delicious!!"}
{"text":"We tried a number of Indian restaurants in Calgary and this was by far the best. We didn't dine in and we ordered food twice from this place. The first time it was not so great --- the mattar paneer was bad and the raita was super-sour. The second time we ordered Alu Gobi and Dhal --- wow! it was awesome and spicy and importantly didn't leave us with a heart burn later. It helped with our Indian food cravings. The lady who took our order also packed a side of condiments and plates and forks. Definitely a good place to eat in Calgary."}
{"text":"Been there a couple of times with a bunch of Indian co-workers. They were not impressed, but said that the place was A-OK, so that is my rating.  I am not a big fan of Indian food, though like to go for it from time to time - and as per my personal perception quality was just about ok. Nothing to do with the level of Royal India, for example.  Service was rather nice, though a bit on the slower side, and it always took a hefty share of time to wait for a bill to be processed. Otherwise the place was ok."}
{"text":"Ok...just to put this in perspective..I am not a fan of Indian food really..too saucy and brown..not enough bright colours to be visually appealing. I am a Vegan and love my veggies.  My BF suggested this place and it's close to where I live so I agreed.  The appies Pakors..veggie and onion were to DIE for...my tastebuds were soooooo happy.  We had rice, Naan and Palak Aloo and Aloo Gobhi.    I was smiling and MMMMMMing the whole time!!!  I am a fan!  Service was also great.....just the right amount of attention and the servers knew all the ingredient in everything we ordered"}
