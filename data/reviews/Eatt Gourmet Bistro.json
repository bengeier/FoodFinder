{"text":"We went there to celebrate wifey birthday.  French and had vegan options I was sold there.  Never had French with vegan options.   The place is really upscale looking and the waiter Alexander was great.  He explained all the options and made sure our glasses were not empty.    We ordered beet salad and ratatouille for main course and tapioca pearls pudding for dessert.   Beet salad was fresh and it had that crispy taste.  Ratatouille was eggplants, capsicum, vegan cheese layered dish which was cooked to perfection   The icing on the cake was the tapioca pearls pudding with some edible orchid petals.   All the food was beautifully decorated and yet it was tasty!!!   5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"By far my new fav restaurant! Impeccable service and the food is to die for. I really like that they have many vegan/vegetarian options. The goat cheese tartine, sweet peas & carrots, cabbage/lentil salad, macaroon, and exotic fruits dessert was so delicious my mouth is watering just thinking about it! I'm looking forward to going back to try other items very soon!"}
{"text":"We came across this restaurant on our way home. We gave it a try and the food is amazing !! Jose and Jessica gave us great customer service. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly people here! Really love the environment. Makes me relaxed and happier, and the whole vibe gives me better appetite:)"}
{"text":"Just had a yummy quiche with a raspberry lemonade ... served in a real glass while listening to French Aznavour and Julien Clerc singing in the background. The staff is very nice and friendly. I heard one employee offering a glass of water while a customer was waiting for her to-go order. The menu is HEALTHY. I love the California-style modern decoration with small flower pots on the wall and the ornaments  with small plants set on the table. A great French/Healthy/California I plan to visit on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Very good lunch, nice and clean  and delicieux Food very different. The dessert superbe!!! The Peaple very friendly ."}
{"text":"It's our very first time at Eatt. We did not know what to expect as we walked in. Throughout our dinner experience, Jose and Nicolas are so friendly, knowledgeable, helpful and accommodating, along with their chefs' genuine creativity, detailed thoughtfulness in the dishes they made, our degree of liking for this place grew from 'mild (skeptical)' to 'intense (loving it!!!!!!)' by the end of the night.   The presentation of every dish is exquisite, taste is light yet explosive in flavors.   Good to know that they do catering for special occasions on/offsite. Definitely worth giving them a try!!!  Eatt, keep doing what you are doing!!!"}
{"text":"I've just moved back to Vegas (again!) and was looking for Red Velvet Cafe.  I was sad to see it's gone but Eatt moved into the same strip mall so I thought I'd give it a try.  It's fabulous and the owners and staff are all very enthusiastic.  I've been twice by myself and then brought my husband, who loved it as well.  It's Euro portioning, which is just perfect for me since I can't shake that very unhealthy \"clean your plate\" mentality.  So if you're a big eater, like my husband, you might want to try a few things.  It's not expensive, so not a big deal that the portions aren't huge.  They did a great job with clean and casual decor."}
{"text":"The food was AMAZING and very, very tasty. We ordered the leak and another soup which was Thai-like: coconut and citrusy. Both were extremely delicious. Then we all ordered the octopus, which came from Spain - very tender. It was the best octopus I had in several years; done properly with a mixture of vegetables that accompanied it exquisitely. Then of course, coffee and dessert. We ordered the chocolate cake and chestnut creme puff. It was heaven without it being overwhelmingly sweet. We were so happy with the food that we ordered sandwiches to go: the cured ham panini, a vegetable one and a tuna sandwich. The panini had a pesto sauce and mozzarella. Delicious! And the prices were very affordable for the quality of food. The chef even came out to check-in with everyone to see if the food was to their liking. Very professional, including the staff. The interior of the place is clean and modern. So don't let the unassuming exterior fool you - this place is a GEM in Las Vegas. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Been here about 8 times and mostly pleasant experiences. The restaurant is airy and refreshing in the warm months but often feels cold and lonely in the cooler months. We usually order the steak, salmon and duck. All excellent to keep us coming back. However, the last time we were there in July, the salmon and the duck were both changed and the new recipes left us very disappointed. The service is generally fine (could use a bit more relaxed warmth) but inconsistent sometimes, especially when you get 2-3 different people serving you throughout an evening, something will be missing. I understand it's a small staff. Sometimes it still feels like an experimental pop-up. This can be good or bad, depending on what you are looking for. I personally feels like since the set up is casual and healthy food, the atmosphere should be more lively. I kept wishing someday I will walk in there and it will be loud and fun. I still do."}
{"text":"\"Exotic Fruits\" was amazing!!!. It's an explosion of different flavors. Every bite was an event.   Exotic Fruits- Macha tea biscuit, coconut foam and passion fruit caramel."}
{"text":"I am very picky and selective eating out. Even more serious about ingredients, preparetion and taste now, when I am expecting baby. I am so glad \"Eatt healthy food\" exit and I can totally trust them. I felt like Sheff  Yuri made my dish not for a guest but for a family member. My friend and I shared the broccoli guacamole, which was a great idea. Then I had salmon with beet and sprouts- so delicious. Best housemaid strawberry lemonade I've ever try. And for dessert I picked the pistachio one. You must not leave without tasting it!  Affordable local new place, very modern design, great service and healthy, creative, tasty food. I would Eatt healthy again and again!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised, excellent healthy food and attentive staff. Thank you to the Chef for attentively approach to ensure food was right. Great service!"}
{"text":"I have tasted their delicious and beautiful food at a recent event. Just amazing. Plus they are lovely young French gentlemen who really aim to please. Give them a call and see how they can make your life a bit easier!"}
{"text":"Very satisfying food . The quiche was delicious and they have a variety of Sanpellegrino ."}
{"text":"Wow, what an unexpected and pleasant surprise!!  To find a restaurant like Eatt in an unassuming location in the Las Vegas exurbs. We shared an appetizer, pan con tomato, which was amazing--beautifully presented, jamon, tomato and pesto on a piece of toasted baguette, with a really interesting and delicious \"piece\" of freeze-dried balsamic vinegar. For main I had the beef special of the day, beautifully medium-rare strips of ribeye with a wine reduction, with pur√©ed vegetable, morel mushrooms and peas--an excellent combination. For dessert we shared the cream puffs with praline pastry cream, quite delicious. We also had a glass of Cores du Rhone which was excellent and very reasonably priced. The restaurant subtitle is Healthy Food, and I found the freshness of the ingredients and the method of preparation to make good on that claim while also introducing new ideas and new ways of appreciating food."}
{"text":"Super,a new place to eat, the food is very delicate, Beautifull looking and a nice taste. I wish them a lot of success because they really deserve it. Bravo a vous les trois garcons ,vous avez tout compris. Voil? 2 nvx clients de plus. Long vie."}
{"text":"During my Vegas trip I Eatt three times in this restaurant, 2 lunchs and one dinner and I remember of each one and how much it was incredible ! Each side and entrees of the lunch menu look very good, but if you ask me to make a choice (what is very difficult) I will say that I prefer the Butternut soup and the chicken wrap  \"What about the dessert ?\" Amazing too but my favorite one is the Tapioca !  The dinner menu was crazy too, and I finally choosed the Gaspacho very fresh and sweet. And after the piece of Black Angus (and because I am a meat amator) there is no word to describe how tasty and perfect was the beef.   The red wine selection is perfect too.  This healthy and gourmet restaurant is a very nice place which diserve the five stars on Yelp. Thank you and congrats to all the team for this 3 exceptionnal moments. I think I m gonna make a new break to take a Lunch in this place.  Je recommande of course !"}
{"text":"Well, it's a great place  Clean, warm and classy.  Service: 5   Food: delicious and well packed... proper portions and beautiful display. Love it!"}
{"text":"So I read another review and literally laughed out loud bc I have also driven by thinking \"oh no another doomed restaurant\" I have gone to swish next door a 1000 times (also amazing food) and have seen this restaurant change so many times. I HOPE THIS ONE STICKS man this food is good. Had to try the broccoli guacamole, it was surprisingly good. Going to try to make that at home. But the QUICHE LORRAINE was off the hook. Wow. My friend had the seasonal steak salad and it looked amazing she said it was great. Owners were very nice as well as staff. Try it out for sure. Great place!"}
{"text":"Higher price for a lunch spot, but a nice alternative from the strip (20min drive) and very nice decor. We would come back for dinner. Salmon dish was delicate yet nicely balanced and the duck was also very good, though a touch on the fatty side. We enjoyed the entire meal."}
{"text":"What a unique find, with a concept that easily conveys simplicity and elegance at the same time. I stumbled upon Eatt on my drive home and am pleased to have made the stop. The duck breast highlighted the combination of flavors I'd expect from a high end restaurant. The menu was short and simple, only focusing on what they do best. The chocolate cake was also one of a kind.  But I won't ruin the surprise - you'll have to come and find out for yourself.    So be adventurous. Try something new. You'll be amazed by Eatt!"}
{"text":"I had the daily special which was Rib eye with ratatouille. The sauce tasted really good and the vegetables were delicious! Definitely coming back to this place"}
{"text":"Great  and healthy food ,  friendly staff.   Very high quality European style food, but with California style healthy options.  All so great that they tell u exactly about possible allergens in each food"}
{"text":"Exquisite gourmet cuisine hiding out in plain sight in a Las Vegas strip mall! Don't be fooled: It looks vaguely like a juice bar/acai bowl-type place, but the refined flavors and presentation are on par with a very high-end restaurant. What a lovely surprise, then, to embark on a gustatory adventure when the setting (and prices) are so comfortably low-key. The food is not only good, it surprises and delights--the hallmark of an exceptional restaurant. Everything we tried was wonderful, from the classic ham & cheese baguette to an ambitious butternut squash soup that was topped with coffee foam, truffle oil, and sauteed mushrooms. Don't miss the superb tiramisu, enhanced from the standard offering by a crunchy chocolate topping. I think it's worth noting that our children, 9 and 11, had a wonderful time here and cleaned their plates. We are very grateful to the staff and chef for their dedication to their craft and sincere hospitality, and wish them every success."}
{"text":"Great place, Great food, Great service. If you are looking for healthy food, this is THE place. My favorite restaurant in town! :-)"}
{"text":"This place is the best! Delicious, healthy food presented very aesthetically and quickly. These people know what they are doing!"}
{"text":"This review is based solely on the food. Decor was minimalist and a little less cozy than I'd like and the service was a little spotty but friendly, but with that being said I would never return. I tasted about 40% of the menu on my visit with 2 other diners a few weeks ago. Absolutely flavorless and pretentious. When I mean flavorless I mean not an ounce of salt on anything. Duck was way over cooked and skin was not rendered properly. Chicken pot au feu was bland, cold and chicken was dry as sand paper. Wine and beer menu non existent. How can you possibly have the balls to put the word Michelin starred cuisine on this dumpster fire of a menu and wine list. Terrible"}
{"text":"I know these guys , I just tried their new restaurant the other day and I was lucky enough to hire them as a private chef for a dinner party. If you're into eating clean , light and healthy inspired by French technique by a team that have come from Paris and south of France come here ,or best yet have them come to your home and use your kitchen . Either way the food is just perfect with a lots of flavors,  not salty , not oily , just fresh and clean eating   . Note: Try the chicken."}
{"text":"Place is incredible inside and the food is just as wonderful of a surprise! Please try it out...I want this place to thrive!!"}
{"text":"I was really sceptical about eating here.  But the food is irresistible. Everything was so yummy and the waiters ate very knowledgeable about the ingredients.  A++"}
{"text":"Amazing food quality and presentation on a concise menu that also includes vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free options. The owners we met were lovely people. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great service with an awesome staff. Was really excited to eat my to-go order of their \"ravioli-soup\" they had. It was a special for $12. I was surprised at the price, but it sounded good so I ordered it. When I opened it to eat it after leaving I saw that I had ONE RAVIOLI in the soup?! Yes I knew it was a soup but she had talked up the ravioli and I never would have expected to only have one included. I am extremely upset bc I feel like I really wasted my money. Won't be a returning customer."}
{"text":"we had the Leek Soup, Artichokes and the burger all vegan! Delicious and affordable, great ambiance and service.. We will definitely come back to this hidden jewel  ahhhh and the vegan chocolate cake!!!! OMG!!"}
{"text":"My brother-in-law took me here on my first trip out to Vegas. He knows French food better than I do so I definitely took his word for it. I had a caf√© latte, a French soup with pureed peas and spinach and it tasted absolutely delicious. We also had a French bread with cheese and butter to snack on. My favorite thing was the chocolate croissant and the cafe latte. I met the owners and I was very impressed with their level of professionalism and their detail to the restaurant. I hope this restaurant succeeds in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is quality thru and thru.  Ingredients are farm fresh combination of ingredients are inspiring don't miss out on the tiramisu either!  Portions are not as small as we thought, although they can add up to maybe 80$ for 2 people without alcohol.  Seasonal menu...Call starts in a couple weeks, def. Coming back for that too."}
{"text":"I love the beet salad with salmon, and the croissant is to die for. People are very friendly and the service are awesome . I strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I would definitely rate this place more than 5 stars if I could. First off, their customer service is TOP NOTCH! Probably the best service I've received in vegas. The food was incredible as well. I ordered the ratatouille and my bf ordered the salmon. We also shared the salmon and tuna ceviche. All the dishes were delicious; especially the ceviche. What's impeccable about these dishes was that we can taste each ingredient all beautifully blended together. That's one superb chef! For dessert we had their raspberry macaron and exotic. Both were beautifully presented and super tasty. I seriously can't wait to visit eatt gourmet bistro again!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken entree, broccoli guacamole, and the ratatouille rolls.  Everything was amazing and the ingredients tasted fresh. I work not too far from here; I might have to have some food delivered for lunch one day. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Just googled CLEAN EATING SALADS this week to find something different. My neighbor and went to lunch here and loved everything about it! Tonight I took my husband for dinner and he also was impressed! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Terrific food! Even my (picky) husband liked it and he has to be dragged kicking and screaming to eat anything remotely healthy. Don't let the word Healthy in the name confuse you. This is seriously good food! French food with an innovative flair! And Be sure to save room for dessert ."}
{"text":"Great service, it's decorated very neatly, but cozy. Came here for lunch and everything was delicious. Portions are healthy and appropriate. Guys with big appetites might leave hungry, but for a normal serving size, it's plenty.   I had the leek soup, cured salmon club, and the exotic fruit dessert. They also have a lunch special for $20 which includes, a drink, half sandwhich, half side, and a small dessert.  The menu changes seasonally depending what is fresh, which is what I really enjoy.  I will have to be back for dinner."}
{"text":"I was in town for a family emergency and I was trying to find a healthy place to eat nearby. This place had some good reviews so we thought we would try it. Unfortunately it ended up being a giant waste of money. It really was way too pricey for what it was. We ended up spending $70 for what was essentially deli food on an IKEA plate. The water had floaters in it. The coffee tasted like it came out of a keurig. It was just not worth it at all. 2 stars for the decor and overpriced tiramisu."}
{"text":"Wow, holy shitt,  the food here is incredible.   The butternut soup might me the best soup I have ever  tried in my life,  french onion was amazing as well.  Lamb sandwich was awesome,  I can't wait to come back here for dinner!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Very convenient - we live close by. The food is delicious, nutritious, and beautifully presented. Exceptional! Can't wait until dinner hours are added! Everyone working at this restaurant was very friendly and personable.  Flavors were spot on - we tried the broccoli guacamole, salmon club sandwich, chicken entree, and the beet salad. Each dish was creative and delicious. A bit too many sprouts in the beet salad, but still very good. We were not impressed that some items came out on china and others in to go containers - this took away from the overall seated dining experience. To go containers should only be used to go. My husband's meal in to go containers came out so far in advance of my meal (on plates), that he was finished before my food even arrived.   For desert, we tried the cheese cake and another desert (I'm not sure of the name) with coconut and a matcha biscuit on the bottom. So good! We loved the smaller bites - not really desert people, but these looked too good not to try and they did not disappoint. Delicious!! Can't say that word enough times!  As a new business, we are sure there are some kinks to be worked out, but over all we were very pleased and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here. We were drawn by the YELP reviews and looking for a healthy lunch.  The food, service and ambience were great! We will definitely come back the next time we are in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Fabulous French food but in addition to how great the food tastes, the presentation is just as awesome.  We found ourselves commenting on the presentation and creativity throughout the entire meal from apps to dessert.  Great experience for my tastebuds and my peepers"}
{"text":"LOVE! This place is beautiful. Sahara and Buffalo. You can order online. And the food is AMAZING! This will be a regular spot for us. We had the spinach leek and potato soup and the chicken pot au feu. Delish! I love their healthy approach to French food, honoring freshness without all the butter. Not that I don't love butter - but it's great that we can now enjoy perfect French food without any heaviness. So glad you're here!"}
{"text":"I did a search on Yelp last night looking for a new place to eat. The first dozen or more places that came up were Mexican, Chinese, pizza, or greasy American cuisine.  I was looking for something healthy and interesting.  Just when I was about to give up on my search and head out to get a salad at Sweet Tomato, I hit \"browse more\" one more time and finally the perfect place appeared --- Eatt Healthy!!! I read a few reviews, grabbed my husband and we were off.  The food was awesome!  I had scallops and my husband had angus beef. The  scallops were served with a tender & flavorful ravioli and the the steak came with their signature ratatouille rolls. The presentation was colorful and interesting.  The service was a bit slow but it gave me time to visit with my husband and unwind from a stressful week.  I highly recommend \"Eatt Healthy\".  The portion sizes are adequate and you will have room for dessert -- which are delightful!!"}
{"text":"Very nice new place to eat. I ate there last sunday. Very good food nicely presented in moderate portions. Very nice interior design and run by attentive owners. I tried 2 meals. Both were great."}
{"text":"This is a very healthy place where you will enjoy great food, I had a great time. Very fresh food and modern atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is mine and my fianc√©'s second time coming here and since our last visit they have expanded on vegan options. I'm vegan and my fianc√© is not so this place is great for us both being happy! Our server was very knowledgeable and fantastic! I had the leek soup and impossible burger, so amazing! My fianc√© had the french onion soup and lamb Wellington, he was blown away. We also shared the endive salad which we both loved and was vegan. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Delicate flavors,  such attention to detail.  I was attending a dinner party that was catered by Yury and Vincent.  They served these beautiful buffet style platters. They were pieces of art I had to photograph them before we devoured them.  The amuse bouche was a lovely chilled Asparagus soup,  it had a parmesan chip and Asparagus spear as garnish,  just lovely.   The main course  was slow cooked Chicken breast that was Oh so tender and juicy. The vegetarian main was Ratatouille, if your not familiar with this French dish it's all vegetarian, it's egg plant and zucchini, tomato, red bell pepper,  herb dish simply delicious. Many of our friend are vegetarian so this was a big hit.    Other of the dishes where a broccomoly, with corn chips.  This was just delicious and a great appetizer.  It was a smooth guacamole inspired broccomoly, it was made with broccoli. Someone actually asked \"it's not guacamole?\"   Then there was a reminder of a classic nicoise salad but with anchovies and surrounded by perfectly cut English Cucumber. The balance of savory and sweet was perfect. Quiet delicious.   Another lovely salad was a heirloom tomato and Mozzarella platter.  Made to be feasted on.  I could of ran away with it and enjoyed all by my self.  Sharing is overrated.   Yuri and Vincent,  you guys have a great thing going here."}
{"text":"OMG!! It was sos so delicious . I ordered the ham and cheese sandwich which is prosciutto ham. French cheese on a crusty baguette. Then the butternut soup served with  coffee foam and cream. It was so tasty.  Dessert we shared a tiramisu that was the best I ever had.  The deliciousness oozed from it   Also we had the macaron which was a decadent combination of cinnamon apples chocolate and cheese.  Yum everything on this menu was served beautifully. The service was great and the owner Nicholas is customer conscious and direct from Paris.  A taste of Paris at a great price right in our back yard."}
{"text":"Great place.  One of a kind.  Really high end, beautiful food in a casual setting.  Diamond in the rough!  I ordered the salmon and it was unlike anything I've ever had before.  Plated like a work of art and flavors/textures I've never had before.  It was SUPERB.  Seriously.  I'm shocked at how interesting and delicious it was.  It was so much better than a lot of the Michelin rated restaurants in NY.  Not kidding.  And you CANNOT beat the price!  How the hell do they make money?   The vegan chocolate dessert was also delicious.  I'm not a huge chocolate person and the melding of the chocolate with the mango/pineapple center and the crunchy base worked so well together.  My dad got the vegan burger and he loved it.  The only thing we questioned was the side of red cabbage.  I love cabbage and put it in everything. I even eat it plain raw sometimes. But this time, it didn't do it for me.  It puzzled me.  But all in all- AMAZING place.  Wish I lived closer.  The waitress was also very attentive and sweet.  I can't wait to eat here again :)"}
{"text":"This is quite simply one of the best hole in the wall finds in Vegas. Anyone who understand French food will appreciate the effort and talent these guys have. We have eaten at a few Michelin Star places over the years and the standard of food here is similar while being a little healthier and very affordable. Well done! We will be back regularly."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant, service good, friendly staff and the chef comes out to speak with the customers. We wish we found it sooner. If your looking for a healthier alternative to all those overpriced mass produced buffets while in Vegas that also tastes great, then this is the place."}
{"text":"Great gourmet food, wonderful experience on my trip to Las Vegas 100% worthy! Must try this place! Gourmet cuisine in a very casual place and excellent price!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Beautifully prepared, exquisite presentation, delicious.   Steak salad- simple. perfect. Salmon- perfectly cooked, served with a delicate beet salad... perfect pairing.  Scallops- wonderfully seared and paired with luscious sweet potato pur√©e and leek raviolis.   Seriously good food.   I UberEATS'd the food, and it came beautifully packaged and wonderfully delicious. I will definitely be coming into the restaurant for my next experience as I can only imagine how much better it would be."}
{"text":"FANTASTICALLY prepared food in a strip mall!  If it were in another location or on the strip prices would be double!   Service and presentation 5 star too! We had Butternut Veloute, Duck Breast perfectly prepared, Dover Sole, and dessert was simply Devine!  Cheesecake with a tangerine liquid center and a calamansi cream on top. If only we lived closer!"}
{"text":"Great place to take a woman and try to impress her. They have everything a dame could want Gluten free nut allergy free vegan stuff and I can also get something to eat here : like the steak salad is very good! if you want your food to be and art masterpiece before you eat (I dont) then this place is right up your Foofy alley!"}
{"text":"We've had dinner here several times always surprised at the perfect preparation and flavor on every dish.   Even the simple pea pur√©e & ratatouille is Devine.   Steaks are Amazing and the rest of the menu is everything your heart really desires, whether you realize it or not."}
{"text":"My brother recommended Eatts based on his telephonic and internet research. After hearing about our meal there tonight, he will hold his manhood cheap that he was a-bed in Georgia.  Everything we ate was exquisite. Yet we wished we could have tried every dish everyone around us was eating. Every single person raved about every selection. What was unique about Eatts was that the food was delicious without relying on butter, oil, and salt. Very subtle spices and perfect marriages of ingredients. Wow!  Great taste and good for you. What a concept.  Question: who didn't give it 5 stars? Eric Cartman?  April 23. At Eatts again tonight. If we could wake him up, Louis Quatorze would weep upon seeing that ordinary people can walk into a restaurant and be served food better than any the Sun King ever tasted. The tasting menu was unbelievable. I'll just mention the duck breast. It was so fresh and tender it must have just happened to fly in the window and crash into the broiler. The service was great (again). You owe it to yourself to go to Eatts Bistro."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday for lunch, as it is right near my office. They seemed a little confused upon my arrival and when I asked for a table for one. I'm guessing that most people who come in alone are only there to order or pickup takeout? Once seated though my waiter gave me such attentive service that I no longer felt odd. And another single diner came in as I was paying my bill. Honestly, the service here is impeccable. Towards the end of my meal another waiter came by to clear my plate and ask if I wanted dessert. When my waiter reappeared a couple of minutes later, he apologized profusely for making me wait.  I ordered the Impossible Burger which came upon recommendation from the waiter and was very yummy (although a bit too meat-like for this girl who really doesn't like red meat). The hashbrowns acting as buns was a nice to choice but made i the burger very hard to pick up. I ended up eating the entire meal with a fork and knife.  The price for the burger and cabbage salad was a bit steep at $18. Add that to my espresso, tax and tip, my quick Monday lunch cost over $25. But I'll always pay more for quality. Next time I'm going back just to try their onion soup."}
{"text":"We were very very impressed with the meal that Yuri and Vincent prepared for us. At the level of \"haut-de-gamme\" at home with out own wine by a friendly and very professional team. The food was creative but not pretentious, all about wonderful ingredients and taste. I especially appreciated the way the vegetables were prepared; they were an integral part of the meal experience, not just an afterthought as often is the case in restaurants. I would recommend to anybody for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Wow - Great French food with a healthy twist of the strip. Great and friendly service. Simple menu with a couple of great choices. We had several different dishes and one was better then the other. A highly recommend to stop by. Don't get fooled by the location."}
{"text":"Amazing healthy food and great service! I highly  recommend the club salmon sandwich."}
{"text":"This was my first time dining here and I was impressed by its inclusion on the Eater Essential 38 for Vegas.  In short, I was blown away and cannot do it justice in a review.   The cuisine was just outstanding in every way.  It was delicious, high quality food minimally processed, yet presented in a fashion reminiscent of a Michelin Star restaurant.   This is not surprising, considering the impressive background of the French chefs.  The cost of the meal was a third of what you'd pay for a similar experience in one of the gourmet rooms on the Strip, yet the food was just as good.   The concept of Eatt may be off-putting to some serious gourmands, as the \"healthy\" banner often means bland, uninteresting food.  These chefs clearly demonstrate you can have your cake and eat it too.  Speaking of pastry, the desserts reminded me of some I've had in high end patisseries in Paris.  Both of the chefs are on their way up and will be big names someday.  Get here sooner than later, and order the Chef's Tasting Menu for a great demonstration of what they can do.  I can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"Finally !!!  I hope this neighborhood gets more restaurants like this one. So good Owners and chef attentive as well. I loved the experience NOT being in a casino. Boutique and tasty!!!"}
{"text":"Everything we tried was amazing (duck entree and appetizers). Excellent and very personable service! We will sure come back again."}
{"text":"There are plenty of places in Vegas that make food that is pretty enough to be art. But those places are usually on the Strip, ridiculously priced, and likely just as bad for your waistline as your wallet. Enter Eatt: a French-run bistro-style lunch joint with a focus on healthy, fresh foods. I don't think I could have dreamed it up.  Over the past month, I've been by a handful of times and tried the majority of the menu. Favorites include the quiche (perfect for a late breakfast!), the salmon club (it even travels well!), and the ratatouille rolls (I grab them as a side for my protein at home). The broccoli-guacamole was an interesting app (and I'd love to see what they could do with a pea version!) but the desserts are where they shine.  The menu lists which desserts are healthier and which are more indulgent, which is helpful as they all look amazing. The strawberry-rhubarb macaron (healthy side) was a delight, but the Exotic Fruits (combining coconut, passion fruit, and matcha) recommended by the staff was even better, reminding me of Yonaka's desserts with the beautiful plating and Japanese flavor influence.   Staff provides excellent service, Nicolas in particular always looks genuinely happy to help each patron. The interior is a fun mix of modern furniture and garden decor accents, complete with miniature terrariums on the tables. So glad this spot opened in such a convenient location- now I can grab a great meal before or after the gym, without compromising on flavor or my goals!"}
{"text":"OMG! Why haven't we been here before? Hidden Gem. Only a few blocks from my house and the food is amazing. I had the ratatouille and wife had the puff pastry whole fish that were both amazing.   The pan con tomate wasn't traditional but, a very good twist. This chef knows how to take a traditional dish and make it better. A must try:"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Came here for a Valentine's day lunch date.  It was amazing! Husband had Lyonnaise Salad, Lamb Wellington and the Vegan Chocolate cake. I had the Butternut Soup, the special, which was a seafood ceviche, and the passion fruit dessert. EVERYTHING was amazing!!! Thank you so much! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING, I was thoroughly floored by how good vegan food could be.  I came here a few months ago (we're not local) and vowed to come back again!  We had the moussaka and desserts and some other things I can't remember but it was ALL delicious.    Now, true story: I planned a trip near Grand Canyon 2 weeks ago.  While our main trip was visiting Havasupai, I specifically set a one-night pit-stop in Vegas, with the sole purpose of going to Eatt.  (my bf can attest to this, I could not stop talking about it, for months).  Arrived in Vegas on Saturday night a bit tired, so we thought we'd save Eatt (literally my only reason to stop by Vegas) for Sunday.  The next morning, practically jumping out of the bed to go to Eatt, we found out it is CLOSED ON SUNDAYS!!!!!!!  completely ruined my day (again, boyfriend can attest to this.  I pouted for at least 2 hours).    So the moral of the story is REMEMBER THEYRE CLOSED ON SUNDAY!! Get your good Eatts fix Monday - Saturday!"}
{"text":"Wow. What a find. We visit Vegas about 4 times a year, and this place is around the corner from our holistic restorative dentist. We are always trying to find healthy places to eat. This place is it. The food is so fresh, the service is excellent and friendly, and the atmosphere is very modern but casual. I had the miso marinated salmon and my wife had the steak salad. Both so good. The flavored teas are ll housemade and very good. We had a hibiscus sparkling wine and homemade tiramisu for dessert. Wow, again just amazing. This place will be on our list for all of our return visits to Vegas."}
{"text":"Gazpacho: Cold soup made from Tomato, Bell Pepper, hint of Watermelon, poured over zucchini and sweet potato puree, some cucumber, tomatoes, with toasted ciabatta bread.  Delicious and guilt free!"}
{"text":"Very fresh, very healthy, lots of wonderful menu items, cool music, patio, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"What a hidden little joy this place is. We had driven past it a few times and thought it looked interesting, so on a recent date night when we were deciding where to go we thought we would give Eatt a try. French food isn't usually my thing - usually overpriced, and too much butter used all over the place, but this place was different! We have been Vegan for a few years now and there was plenty of great choices on the menu that were very yummy. We will definitely be coming back here sometime soon."}
{"text":"YO, THIS PLACE IS AMAZING.  Our whole experience here from start to finish was unbelievable. First, I had to call and find out if they had TVs because my husband *had* to watch some football game (don't get me started). Jessica who answered the phone said they usually leave them off at night but that she would turn one on to the game for my high maintenance husband.   When we arrived, the game was indeed on and we got a table where the hubs could watch the Kansas City Chiefs crush the Chargers while sipping his Pinot Noir. Cool. Next up, our server Alex.  Alex is hilarious and a totally nice dude. He made great recommendations for us on the meal. I went with the vegan options and they were bomb dot com (nobody says that anymore but IDC). I regret not doing the five course tasting menu because the food was THAT good. I ordered the vegan dessert even though I was kind of \"meh\" about the idea of dark chocolate with mango and pineapple but it was SO delicious.   My husband had some seafood soup first - he loved it. Then the deconstructed veggie burger with potato hash bun - which was unreal good. We will definitely be back the next time we're in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"The food is so yummy!  My table had ordered every single dessert item and we all tasted each one, oh my goodness, so delicious!  My favorite dessert was the chocolate cake--the praline puffs were my second favorite, if you are up to try something more obscure!  Nicolas waited on our table and made us feel like VIPS.  Thank you Nicolas.  I wish the best to the establishment."}
{"text":"This turned out to be a neighborhood gem.  Gourmet food in a light and breezy atmosphere.  I went there for lunch and was surprised how delicious and fresh everything was.  Do yourself a favor and try the tiramisu."}
{"text":"A delicious hidden gem! The food is perfection and the service was lovely. Best caprese in town. Can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5 out of 5 but we can't do half stars lol. This place has good potential considering it is a health conscious spot with quality ingredients and the presentations are on point. Unfortunately there were a few flaws within my meal. I started with the broccomole which is their take on guacamole but made with broccoli. It was really clean and delicious served with some semi stale tortilla chips. I got the tuna Ni√ßoise salad which came with a very subtle tasting dijon dressing that was a bit too thick but it did pair well with the salad. All in all it was very good and I would order it again. For my entree I got the chicken with pea pur√©e. The chicken was kinda bland but it's saving grace was the pur√©e because it was delicious and gave it flavor. The sauce or reduction got hardened before it got to my table so it was disappointing that I couldn't really try it. There were also some pieces of pancetta on the plate and I don't remember seeing it in the description which sucks since I don't eat pork :/ I just set it aside. I love their concept on healthy, clean eating. The presentation looked great on everything I got and I can appreciate all the fresh ingredients but I had better expectations. I spent about 35 and tipped 5 and I feel like my meal wasn't worth  40 bucks with all the flaws. I'm sad I didn't spend it on ayce sushi lol."}
{"text":"Nice decor, friendly staff.  You can tell that the chef and manager take pride and want to succeed.  The food is presented very well and tastes good.  The puff pastries are delicious!  They let you spin a wheel to win a prize (free coffee for a week, free drink, free dessert, etc for example) if your order over $20 I believe it is.  The only thing I felt sad about is the portion size... Although realistically that's just because I'm used to American portion sizes being more than what we should have.  I believe the chef and manager are French, so it makes sense why they use smaller portion sizes. I'm a 110 lb girl and the salmon entree was a perfect size for me to eat for lunch, but I don't think it'd fill up a man's appetite."}
{"text":"How often do we eat at well-established restaurants (expensive ones, usually) and after the meal agree that one dish shined above the rest?  We agree that while the appetizer was good, we may not order it again.    It is the rare restaurant where the entire experience leaves me saying at the end of the meal, \"Ya know if you put that proverbial gun to my head, I really couldn't tell you which dish I liked best.  They were all superb.\"    From my meal tonight:  Melon rolled around prosciutto with balsamic watermelon.  The melon not too sweet, the prosciutto not too salty, presented as a beautiful flower on my plate, easy to eat, and simply balanced.  Baguettes with goat cheese and caramelized onions.  The right heaviness of the bread, the right balance of sweetness of onions to the not too salty goat cheese.  A perfectly poached piece of king salmon surrounded with ravioli stuffed with spinach and cheese.  Ravioli cooked al dente in the right amount of salt water; cheese that accented but did not take away from the natural flavors of the spinach or pasta; and a delicate foam that added but didn't overpower the beautiful piece of fish.  Dessert:  As tasty as it was pretty -- Light as air pistachio mousse with raspberry fillings, fresh raspberries and a cookie with just the right amount of salt to contrast the simple sweeter flavors.    I often say that Vegas is a gambling and drinking town that only pretends to be a food town.  Not so with this gem off the strip.  It was a lovely experience, casual, unrushed dining, and sophisticated food that left me satisfied but not ridiculously full.  Wait staff professional, friendly and extremely helpful, too.  GO!"}
{"text":"Forgot to post when we were here before.  Can't go wrong with talented chefs.  Must go!!!!"}
{"text":"When We went to this restaurant for the very first time, I just thought just another casual health conscious sandwich shop.....NOT!  This place offers \"serious\" French cuisine .... especially I loved all of their soup.  I almost didn't want to post this review because I want this place to be our secret gem."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing. The food was fresh, properly prepared and a great value for the price. We highly recommend it. Service is amazing and the owner is very friendly and attentive ( Yuri Szarzewski )! One of my favorites restaurants in Las Vegas! Thanks for such a great experience and for taking great care of our family! We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"How to combine a quick lunch, healthy food and great taste? Don't hesitate, go straight to Eatt! The menu shows high-quality and well-presented courses, fresh products as you could expect from a hugh-end restaurant, all-together in a cosy and modern decor. Deserts are as awesome, precise and tasteful. These Frenchies rock!!!"}
{"text":"First time visitor at this restaurant. I pass it every time I go to work and thought I would finally try it out. Ordered the highly recommended Miso and honey marinated salmon. My meal was beautifully prepared and delicious. My waiter was also attentive. She was knowledgeable about the food and ensured we were taken care of. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas!   My go to meal is the Caesar salad with Miso marinated salmon   I love that paired with a nice glass of wine, their tiramisu is to die for!"}
{"text":"When someone tells me there is a new French restaurant, I have to check it out.  Today, I did.  I was quite surprised.  I had the shitake mushroom & leeks quiche with salad.  Now I don't normally like the traditional quiche, but this one could become a habit.  The flavors were wonderful.   I highly recommend Eatt Healthy Food for any occasion.  I have not tried their pastries yet however, I have not forgotten what I saw."}
{"text":"Eatt is not one of those boring and unimaginative \"meal prep\" places. It is healthy gourmet cuisine with beautiful presentations in a casual, comfortable setting. The vegan and gluten free options are abundant and unique. Many of the dishes are available as grab and go items for convenience, but I had the opportunity to dine in and enjoy a few items served on nice plates. Service was excellent and the chef visited the dining area to greet the guests.  The ratatouille rolls resembled a tapas portion. This suited me just fine because I don't like being served large portions and I wanted to try a dessert, but I know many people think differently. The beautiful hibiscus poached pear decorated with toasted almonds was the first item to catch my eye in the display so I ordered that for dessert. It was glazed perfectly with the hibiscus reduction. I'd love this dessert even more if it was filled with almond cream or served with ice cream, so I took it home to add a scoop since they didn't have any at the restaurant.  Spend over $20 for a chance to spin the prize wheel. I was very lucky to win a free dessert on my next visit, so I will be back very soon. I'm looking forward to the burrata salad and trying more sweets designed by eatt's talented pastry chef."}
{"text":"Fabulous place. Loved the ambience and service. Food was fantastic - mixed appetizers of  zucchini. Rolls Charcuterie. Broccoli guacamole. Salmon roulines were delicious. Main courses of wild caught salmon, scallops with mushroom ravioli and pur√©ed sweet potato plus butternut squash soup with mushroom ravioli sand fabulous foam.    Wait, but the deserts. ...   absolutely fabulous.  Exotic fruit and praline cream puffs.  Can't say enough about how good it all was.  Highly recommend Eatt"}
{"text":"I had the salmon club, Sharrie had the chicken entree and we shared a 's press salad. Cost around $30.  I loved the sandwich, creamy dressing with lox. Crust cut off like my mother used to do when I was a kid.  Caprese salad was flavorful and a moz was really good. The pesto was good not sure why it was so green (dark)."}
{"text":"Wow what a wonderful place with excellent food. A bit pricey but so delicious. Excellent and friendly service too. Nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"I recently just heard of this place and am blown away it's been open for 15 months and I just discovered it! I will say, I have heard of it, but in conversations, I thought people were talking about the other one with one T downtown. Oh boy are they different! Eatt is Amazing! I finally found it on Eater and glad I came! A good friend was visiting from out of town and she wanted something fresh and healthy. I wanted something new to me. So we came here and we're NOT disappointed. I honestly, have nothing negative to say. Together we had 6 dishes and then 2 desserts, sharing it all. The decor was clean and bright and I loved the feel inside. We decided on two of their baguette with toppings, the summer salad, and the octopus carpaccio. First of all, the octopus was amazing! Pickled veggies and citrus on top!!!! Something different and such a great combo. Then the summer salad with fruit and freeze dried balsamic. Beautiful and delicious. My favorite was the goat cheese baguette. Oh my word. Carmelo was dominos and warm goat cheese, candied pecans and freeze dried honey chips.... so much yes... Our other baguette was tipped with prosciutto and tomatoes and pesto... delicious as well.  We finished with the \"exotic\" dessert and the cream puffs. Both were great. Coconut, matcha, and passion fruit flavors really were a great way to end. And the hazelnut cream puffs... yup. I'll take more please. I will definitely return to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"Nice surprise running into this amazing place. Small menu, but amazing service, food was so flavorful. Chef is from France so everything was presented beautifully.  Great wine selection. Atmosphere is so elegant. Highly recommended taking you wife, girlfriend or family for a nice quite dinner. Open for lunch also"}
{"text":"We truly enjoyed the tasting menu offered by Eatt last night! The pacing and services were excellent. The flavor, texture, and creativity were superb.  The salmon was so tender and favorable. It was cooked perfectly for medium rare. It was the best salmon entree we ever had! The two desserts gave us a lasting sweet memory. Again they were the best we ever had!  My husband's lamb Wellington was cooked just right. Mine was cooked a bit more than I liked. It was a little gamey and the puff pastry was not as crispy as I would like it to be. However, we enjoyed the whole experience and the ambience!  The value we got from the food over its price was exceptional. The presentation and quality exceeded many high-end expensive restaurants.  Eatt will be a place we will come back when we are in town and will be highly recommended to our friends and families."}
{"text":"Delicious french cuisine better than most places on the strip without the high end prices. The owner and chefs hail directly from Paris so it is superbly and most authentic French. It's not a big restaurant but it is so cozy.   Whenever I'm in the summerlin / SW area, I always stop by to eat here. Everything is made with the freshest ingredients. Tonight I had their hanger steak that comes with this absolutely delicious potato thing encrusted with almonds. I don't know what it's called but that whole dish was sooooo delicious. The steak just melted in your mouth. Of course paired with a french blended wine since I love wine. Omg out of this world!   One of my most favorite french restaurant in the city. I hear they will open up another location closer to the strip. Can't wait to go there!"}
{"text":"Great french food, chef is great ! The only thing I didn't really like was the place by itself, pretty cold and to quiet.... beside that, service was ok and food was amazing"}
{"text":"Refreshing & Delicious!! Vegetable and fruit forward offerings with chef driven cuisine and approachable price points. Roasted Watermelon salad with balsamic was super tasty, familiar flavors yet intriguing execution. Ratatouille with basil was vibrant and textually fantastic. Duck with sweet potato and plum was award winning bites.  Desserts were executed at a level far above the norm for these price points, raspberry macaron with lemon was a winner.  Service was truly hospitable, left feeling full but healthy and looking forward to going back.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Fantastic French Bistro and not what you would expect off strip in Las Vegas. This is the type of place you would expect to find in San Francisco, everything is fresh and very high quality. The master chef Yuri came out and was very polite, the rest of the staff were very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Very hospitable and friendly staff. Welcoming ambiance, it's very clean and decorated pretty and makes you feel at home! The pineapple dessert was my favorite followed by the beet and apple salad. I can't wait to go back and try more!! It's nice to have a neighborhood restaurant that caters towards any dietary need (GF, V, etc!) definitely hit it up!!"}
{"text":"We had an wonderful dining experience last night with excellent service.  Everything the wait staff recommended was delicious, including the cream puffs for dessert!"}
{"text":"Fantastic knowledgeable attentive service. The soups are truly out of this world. Artichoke smoked burrata appetizer was great too. Whole fish entree was good but paled in comparison. Prices are reasonable for the quality and creativity of the food.   I think some background music or white noise would be a good addition. It's a little quiet in there and easy to overhear conversations of others. Don't let strip mall location or first impressions throw you off. This place is a gem."}
{"text":"THE best restaurant in Las Vegas. Being off strip and away from the snazzy hotels, you would NOT expect this place to be this incredible. My fianc√© and I have eaten here twice now, and both times we were blown away. I had spinach ravioli w/ salmon first time & scallops special the last time. The Tiramisu dessert is what dreams are made of!! We will be back again and again!!"}
{"text":"Looking for a cool place to eat heathly food at an affordable price? Don't go any further. \"Eatt\" is the perfect place. The salmon is to die for and that's only the beginning. The desserts are out of this world. Sooooo good. Go for it; you won't regret it for one second."}
{"text":"I was initially disappointed with the menu- there were only a few things for vegetarians. The menu is pretty small with not much descriptions. I admit that I was ready to be disappointed. We ordered the salmon sandwich, ratatoille rolls, broccoli guac, and the zucchini. EVERYTHING. WAS. SO. GOOD.  I feel like you have to leave American expectations at the door with this place. No, its not quite what you're used to. And yes, that's a very good thing. And yes, make sure you get dessert- the cream puffs are A-Maz-ing."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants now! Their salmon is probably the best I've had. The service is great, the food is delicious, and the presentation is A1. Other reviewers are saying the portions are on the smaller side but quality over quantity am I right? And definitely try the broccoli guacamole"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Wonderful lunch specials!  The service is always great and they have some fun ice tea blends that you don't find anywhere else."}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant! it's almost like going to an √âtoile Michelin! Staff is very pleasant and professional.  The food is just delicious, tasty and well presented.  I always order the tomato mozzarella ( REAL mozzarella) and the Mozarella tartine! enjoy the smoked salmon bites!  Delicious oignons soup!  Their desserts are amazing too! very \"raffin√©\".  the restaurant itself is spacious and well decorated. Modern and sober. Still cozy to me   Perfect place for a date night or"}
{"text":"We came here last minute based on yelp reviews as we live on the other side of town. They have vegan and gluten free options, but also serve meat, so don't be scared off! The decor is clean, comfortable, and modern. The service was spot on with beautiful explanations of the specials. We had the broccoli guac which was yummy and smooth with a little heat. We ordered one special, cold pineapple and pepper soup which included yellow beats, crispy basil, and vegan mozzarella. I'm not vegan but this sounded so interesting that we tried it. It was pretty,  flavorful, and had complex tastes that caused us to stop and savor it.  We also had the goat cheese on toasted bread with carmelized onions, sweet pecans, and freeze dried honey crisp and greens. This was SO good!! We also had the steak salad with a tasty light dressing that included lychee. The exotic dessert was possibly the best thing I've EVER eaten. This place was amazing. The flavors and textures and beautiful presentation were spectacular. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Yes, the menu items are a bit on the pricey side, but worth the splurge!  You're paying for the quality of food, service, and presentation.  This was the first time I ever left a restaurant feeling healthier than when I came in!  The pot au feu's chicken bone broth with veggies really settled my irritable digestive system, and despite the small portions, my stomach was quite satisfied with the meal.  Of course, I couldn't resist sampling a few of the desserts too.  Omg, the apple-pie like macaron will now be the standard by which I base all others!  The citrus- topped, coconut tapioca pudding was also both rich and refreshing!  A huge thank you to my attentive and menu-knowledgeable server, Justin, who let me spin the wheel before I headed out.  I scored a free croissant and dessert for the next visit which means I'll have to quickly return to try the rest of the items sooner rather than later!"}
{"text":"Such a great experience. The service, the food, the ambiance; all 10/10. We ordered three different types of the Las Vegas menu and it filled us up completely. The perfect Las Vegas menu combo would include a salmon sandwich, butternut squash soup, with tiramisu and raspberry lemonade.  The menu changes frequently and was told it would change again towards the end of April. I'm excited go come back to try the new menu in the future.  Definitely should try this place out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I really am speechless. This place goes over and beyond in service, ambiance, and quality of product.   I was greeted upon entrance by a friendly young man who was beyond knowledgeable and funny. He sat me at a comfortable table, handed me a menu, and poured me water in a spotless glass while I waited for a friend. I mentioned it was her birthday and that the vegan dessert at the end would be perfect.   When my friend arrived we ordered the broccoli guacamole, the beet salad, the carrots and peas, and the ratatouille (all vegan). We split everything and they actually prepared half portions of everything... beautifully.   My favorite dish was the peas and carrots. It was perfectly seasoned with added crunch in all the mushy perfected goodness.   We ordered was the vegan tapioca balls in coconut milk... graham cracker crumbled and fresh fruit and flower garnish for dessert. Best I've ever eaten!!! I would go back just for this... it was that delicious!   The service was impeccable. Every dish was explained eloquently and in detail upon ordering. All questions were answered and our glasses never went empty. It was probably the best service I've ever had in Vegas... good job guys!   If your looking for a good lunch meet up or a romantic and quiet dinner... definitely bookmark this spot and give it a try!"}
{"text":"Yum!  The French Onion Soup was wonderful!  Nice sized portion with tons of onions, bread/cheese crust topping... so yummy.  Had the Baby Endive Salad which was really good too!  The Passion Fruit dessert was yummy too.  Definitely coming back here for dinner!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch earlier this week and was thrilled to find out they had truffles on special. I had a delicious meal of truffle risotto with clams. It was SO good!!"}
{"text":"Truly this restaurant was the most amazing and impressive surprises I have experienced in a very long time. Eatt was understated but comfortable and it's easy cafe nature conceals an incredible experience for any true 'foodie'. I have eaten in Michelin rated restaurants, met and dined with chef Rubuchon, and experienced every notable restaurant in vegas... that being said- Eatt was genuinely one of the most memorable and impressive meals I have encountered in a long time. The food has an amazing balance of texture and flavor for a trained palette or someone who just enjoys a simple good meal. I can't say enough about this restaurant except go as quickly as you can. I just came back home from NYC feeling sad about the lack of dining experiences here that really engage me but then I found Eatt and I have been telling everyone about it!!! I would give 10 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"I love and enjoy coming here. Wonderful service and food. The tiramisu is amazing! As well as the other things I've had."}
{"text":"The beef and duck are splendid. Green tea dessert and tapioca quite good. Very good service. Pricey."}
{"text":"Super concept, la nourriture est top, les p√¢tes au homard sont d√©licieuses! Tr√®s bon accueil, √ßa fait vraiment du bien de pouvoir manger comme en France ! Allez y les yeux ferm√©s !"}
{"text":"10 stars! Thank you for bringing us a great experience and for bringing such a concept to Las Vegas - french fare with elegance and care in a casual atmosphere and friendly service!  Everything tasted so good and made with such love and care! We were wowed by all the exquisite presentations and different methods of cooking. Our butternut veloute had delicious coffee foam on top, the salmon was cooked medium rare to perfection with a variety of vegetables to complement, the duck breast was so tender and juicy and went really well with the sweet potato pur√©e, and my goodness the desserts were bomb - cream puffs that tasted like Ferrero rocher and exotic coconut mousse green tea pastry with passion fruit coulis. The only lackluster dish was the cabbage stuffed chicken. We all tried it and agreed it was just alright. Their salmon and duck breast were amazing though so order the right stuff! Oh oh forgot to mention, their raw oysters were one of the best we've had! The manager said they're from Japan but we forgot to ask which kind. They made an excellent mignonette, just like how the French do it of course. (I wish they actually spell out this word on the menu so people learn this word instead of tabasco! I have respect for oysters.) on top of that they even made a mini pancake with whipped cream and dill on top to complement the oysters! That was amazing!!!  Service was very friendly. The manager and chef came to greet and talk to us, and our server gave food recommendations and knew exactly was in the food and where they came from. It's definitely a Michelin star experience without the Michelin price tag!  I cannot say enough how much all 4 of us loved this restaurant. When it gets busy, hope we can still make a reservation the next time we come in!!!   C'est d√©licieux! Merci beaucoup!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, over the top! Presentation was everything. Taste and flavor was on point. We ordered the special of the day which was tuna tartare over a bed of asparagus. We also ordered the beet salad and the smoked salmon sandwich. We shared that between 2 ladies and we were full..We had to try the dessert, it taste as good as it looked.."}
{"text":"This place is unbelievably the best restaurant anywhere you must try and leave room for desert beyond belief!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The staff here are very friendly and accommodating. The atmosphere and style of the restaurant has a very clean and modern feel. When it comes to the food, the portions are perfect for someone like me who can't consume large portions. Food here is delicious in addition to being visually appealing. I love everything about this place and I would definitely come back again for more!"}
{"text":"Highly Recommend this beautiful Restaurant. The Food is Amazing, Staff and owners very Friendly. Very Reasonable Price. Every single penny spent worth it."}
{"text":"This is a amazing restaurant in Las Vegas. All foods so good and very beautiful presentation also all about service here too good take care. And restaurant so clean and quiet that good."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Eatt Bistro after being on the to do list for quite some time. The dining space is bright with colors and lots of light provided by the large windows. Seating is both high top and  regular height tables with the regular ones having very comfortable seat and back cushions.  An outdoor patio is also available. One entire wall is covered in wood and the shelving has a variety of interesting glass bottles. A very cleaver design aspect. The wait staff is friendly and they work as a team helping to clear dishes promptly. Beverage refills were offered without asking.  For lunch we had  Onion Soup, Minestrone Soup, Caprese Sandwich and Tiramisu. Beverages were Ice tea and  hot green tea. The Onion Soup is a traditional french onion with an excellent broth that was not salty. There were plenty of sweet onions and cheese. The bowl size was a large portion.   I chose the Spin the Wheel option with allows a choice of a cup of soup, sandwich, dessert and house made beverage. The Minestrone with a vegetable broth, diced vegetables and orzo pasta was delicious. The Caprese consisted of panini bread, ham, tomato, mozzarella and pesto. The bread was perfectly toasted and the sandwich was a great combination of flavors. The Tiramisu is served is a cup with layers of flavors and topped with crispy chocolate and coffee streusel. The Spin the Wheel is a great option. It was a full meal and a  good value.  Kudos to the kitchen for using quality products and providing a variety of choices.  Look forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"I've been to this place about 10 times and all I have to say is I LOVE EATT ! I really enjoyed the Summer menu and I now like the Winter menu as well.  Former Michelin star chef Yuri and pastry chef Vincent from L'Oustau de Baumani√®re in Les Baux de Provence, France opened this restaurant with Nicolas the funny manager who has been on TV ;)))) and now Aymeric, another French chef.  Every dish from the appetizers, entrees to the deserts is first of all a huge pleasure for the eyes and nose. The presentation is outstanding and the smell with the mixture of flavors and spices extremely invited to try and eat everything.  The lunch time offers quiches and salads too and all kind of light options that will fill you until dinner time. Grab and go available. They have homemade drinks like unsweetened raspberry lemonade and iced-teas.  For dinner my favorites are the butternut velout√© soup with mushroom ravioli and coffee foam that had a rich nutty flavor.  They had for the summer a tartine with cherry tomatoes, burrata (creamy mozzarella cheese) and basil pesto that was so fresh and we could taste the best quality olive oil they use. Now the winter option is a roasted goat cheese with candied pecan nuts, onions and honey tartine. Delicious as well, honey and goat cheese are such a good combination !  They serve also chicken pot-au-feu, grilled salmon cooked to your taste, duck, all high standard ingredients that are just prepared to perfection. They also offer vegetarian and vegan options.  Deserts : you have to have'em all !!! The puff pastry that is called Paris-Brest in France, soft crunchy crust and creamy praline feeling, the exotic which combines coconut mousse with passion fruit caramel on a green tea biscuit, just to live for, and the traditional cheesecake. Be sure that you never had a real cheesecake before you tried this one. I prefer the one in the Summer with raspberry than the Winter one with tangerine but stil is very good.  Nice wine list to pair any of those dishes.  The portions are smaller than American standards but fits perfectly what you expect from that kind of high quality food and it's so filling that you couldn't eat more anyway. Just appreciate every bite.  Thank you Eatt for giving us the opportunity to get fine, exquisite, healthy and affordable French food off the Strip, just around the corner."}
{"text":"Wish I could give a 4.5 star . The food we got was AMAZING. The ceviche was great and then I had the caprese salad and added salmon (unreal!). For dessert I got the raspberry macaron (also amazing)! Here is the reason for the docked star. It was SO hot inside the restaurant , I asked them if the air was on and they said it was as low as they could get it . At the end of the meal I was dripping sweat because it was that hot . They need to fix their air or get a new unit because when it's 110 outside I don't want to sit in a restaurant that's 85 degrees .  Also the ceviche was served with tortilla chips from a bag  you could get from the grocery store, it wouldn't be tough to make them their own or make a plantain chip .  Overall I say GO here, but make sure the air is working ."}
{"text":"Very friendly, nicely decorated, slick and warm place to dine.. They serve really healthy food: vegetables, salads, great coffee and more. Affordable and would be suitable for large groups. You get a free spin, I won a danish:)  You should definitely try their salmon salad."}
{"text":"This isn't \"fast\" food, but it was truly exceptional and well worth a little wait. The impossible \"burger\" was more of a statement dish than a traditional burger. Very creative, but more importantly, VERY delicious. Definitely if you come here give it a try!  The minestrone soup was good too! It came topped with a tarragon foam. The whole meal was light and somehow filling at the same time! My stomach thanked me!  We would definitely recommend!!!   Extra points for gorgeous decor and friendly staff! :)"}
{"text":"Ever since checking out this place a few weeks ago I've been raving about it to friends and family. You can tell that everything here is prepared with love and care, and attention to detail is certainly here.   I came here on a Saturday morning with two friends, and the menu was explained in its entirety to us, and everything sounded so tasty. We definitely over-ordered, but everything we sampled was outstanding. We ordered two of the savory French toast topped with smoked salmon and a poached egg, followed by the chicken pot au feu, my duck with vegetables, the seafood pasta, and a steak. To finish the meal, we had the tapioca pudding, and the praline puffs. Everything was beyond what I would have thought from a place located in a small plaza.   I've been patiently waiting for a holiday or birthday to come up so I can bring all of my friends and family here. Easily will be my favorite restaurant in Vegas for 2017!"}
{"text":"A very nice meal in an unexpected place. Located on the corner of Buffalo and Sahara next to a bunch of random stores and restaurants sits EATT. You expect just your run of the mill health spot with the name, but the meal is lavishly presented with great ingredients and tasty options. Prices are a $1 or $2 higher than its health counterparts, but it really is prepared to amaze with the colors and dish alignment   I can for a quick lunch during the week and was immediately seated as the restaurant was virtually empty before noon. I ordered the salmon sandwich and the butternut soup. The sandwich came with a few slices of thin salmon and built in veggies; very good but not immediately better than anywhere else in town. The butternut soup was excellent. A true yellow color with mushrooms and fantastic croutons on the inside.   My entire meal was about $15 after tax. You will be full with an order like this but might be a little small for a true lunch if ordering just one of the items mentioned above. I recommend EATT to anyone who wants an upscale experience and food preparation at very affordable prices."}
{"text":"Whether you are a canivore or a vegan/vegetarian, the food here is so delicious that you really need to try it. We had a 5 course vegan with a added fish option and each plate was more flavorful than the next. The service was superb and the ambiance was quaint, but still modern. Nicolas is so attentive and Chef Yuri is so creative, using only the freshest ingredients and gastronomy (which I think is so cool). We were celebrating a friends birthday and had such a terrific evening. Thank you for making it such a memorable experience. We will definitely be back again, I only hope it will be sooner than later. TRE BON!!"}
{"text":"Although I think they are not in the best location, I hope locals patronize this business.  Presentation:  exhuberant, exotic and exquisite.  Taste:  like I was having lunch at a Michelin restaurant on the strip.  Service:  Very attentive."}
{"text":"Eatt is a gem located outside the strip.  My friend is a vegan and it's hard to find a fine dining spot that accommodates her so easily.  The ambience is not quite so casual but definitely not your typical fine dining.   The food was bougie and incredible and well executed. Our food was delectable , and delicate. The flavors mixed well, the ingredients tasted fresh and the technique was on point.  I loved this spot and my vegan friend was so excited to have a spot to celebrate her special occasions now.   We had a baby with us they also were very friendly.  Props to the chef, the staff, and everyone who works here."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas...by far!!! It's a true hidden gem that you must discover for yourself! Definitely worth the short drive from the strip if you're visiting, and a must if you're a local. We got hooked on our first visit and kept going back. You can eat your way through the entire menu and love every single dish. From appetizers to entrees and desserts, their food is Michelin star-worthy without the Michelin star prices :) Every dish tells a story and you'll want to come back for more. Oh, and did I mention their specials!? They'll have at least one special waiting for you to try every day. It also doesn't hurt that the staff is super nice and friendly. Nicolas is a sweetheart! We'll keep Eatt-ing :D for sure!"}
{"text":"French cafe with the obligatory ham and cheese on baguette turned out to be the best ham and cheese, ever!  I asked for extra butter and Dijon mustard on the side.  Love that European butter on the crispy crust authentic baguette.  A must try!"}
{"text":"I will give this place 5 stars if, when I return, I can get a quick lunch.  The ONLY mar of our experience is that it took a really long time to order, get food, and get the check, and I and a couple colleagues were having a \"power\" lunch, and had to leave to get back to our respective offices/appointments after approximately 75 minutes, but this was a strictly 90 minute lunch experience (or longer--the table to our left was partaking of something like 3 bottles of wine, lol).  The food is a dream.  My \"Scottish salmon\" was perfect, tender, cooked to a perfect medium, with a creamy cauliflower salad that was instagrammable.  They have interesting and healthful offerings, such as the hibiscus lemonade.  The service--aside from the languorously slow French pace--is superb.  We just need to get this down to a power lunch timeframe, and they WILL get that 5th star.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I have been in general disappointed with the food scene in Las Vegas. Happy to find this gem. Everything from service to filtered tap water to delicious deserts were fantastic."}
{"text":"When you want to eat fast, there aren't so many options left beside fast food companies in this area of the town. So it's greatly appreciated to have the opportunity to eat high gastronomy and healthy meals with a short time constraint at Eatt. I went to Eatt a few times since their opening, the chefs and the members of the staff are very friendly and always here to give you advices and recommendations about the menu. They also took a few times the initiative to pick an item on the menu like a dessert or a specialty of the chef to introduce me to new flavors. I've never been disappointed so far! The decor of the restaurant is as refreshing as the food Eatt offers. I've found out today they were cooking specials some days, I can't wait to discover them! A great place I've been lucky to find and where I'm always happy to go back!"}
{"text":"This was our First time dining at Eatt and we did lunch .  The ambience is modern and a bit sterile but one can't complain about a very clean and clean looking interior .   The menu is not overly large and split into a few sections . There is a vegan section if you're into that as well . We had  2 small soups  . The butternut soup was very good and had a coffee foam and some very tasty mushrooms . The French onion soup was also very good in the classic French onion way .   We chose to order an app instead of an entree . We ordered the goat cheese baguette tartine . It was just ok and was a little on the sweet side for an appetizer for our taste , although if you're into the sweeter side of food I'm sure you would love it .   The service was attentive and the servers were very nice .   We were given a free chestnut puff dessert because it took a little while to bring our appetizer . Otherwise a pretty spot on place to dine ."}
{"text":"It's too bad that I've driven by this place a hundred times and never became interested because of the name. I was under the impression it was a healthy food eatery/salad bistro.  Lesson to self: never judge a book by its cover! Really cool place inside! Super modern and clean, wait staff was extremely gracious and helpful with the menu. Perfect spot for a date night! They have specials daily, offer cooking classes and have a jazz night with a prix fixe menu... Salmon blinis to start, a lamb special (amazing) and a steak with mashed potatoes/balsamic reduction. We also ordered a ceasar salad which was one of the BEST we've ever had. *Not really portioned for sharing*, but such amazing flavors!  They don't have a kid friendly menu, but chef completely accommodated ours by making chicken sliders! Just a caution though: if you're going in starving, you will be hungry when you leave!"}
{"text":"This is such a wonderful place. Nicolas and all the employees were very welcoming and friendly. It is worth the ride off the strip to experience the food here. One of the top restaurants in all of Vegas. Our new \"must visit\" every time we are back in town."}
{"text":"I'm so surprised this place didn't show up on the top of the list. It's a very high end quality and presentation food for a very affordable price in a cozy, fresh environment. I hot the veggie lasagna(amazingly thinly sliced yumminess) and we share the salmon/tuna carpaccio( with drops of avocado mouse). The waitress was French and very friendly. Have been telling everybody about this place! Will come back."}
{"text":"Walked here with my boyfriend while my car was getting an oil change. This place has modern decor and music. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. We both picked the salmon club sandwich and I had a side of quinoa. Everything was delicious. Really great spot."}
{"text":"To say I was disappointed is an understatement. I ordered the steak special tonight and was thoroughly miserable with it. The 6 oz of meat was drowned (yes, completely smothered) in a mushroom puree sauce. Why so much sauce? There was more sauce than meat and the sauce was tasteless. The meat was accompanied by a small ramekin of potatoes au gratin. The potatoes were undercooked and again the dish was tasteless. I expected some flavor but nothing. And my dish overall looked horrible. A ton of bland brown sauce covering two lumps of meat and a side of bland potatoes. No garnish. Seriously, no vegetables or something to make the dish look appetizing? No way a Michelin star chef made this dish. It was an embarrassment. The portions were very small, too. The worst part is the dish cost $34, insanely expensive for a small steak and a small portion of potatoes. Since I didn't eat the potatoes I basically paid a ton for a piece of meat. I left feeling ripped off.  And, note to the owner, if your AC is not working could you at least put ice in the water? I cannot believe how hot it was and not one effort was made to make the guests more comfortable. Maybe offer a cool drink on the house? The heat made me so uncomfortable eating. Honestly, I wish I could get my money back."}
{"text":"I always pass by this place and want to check it out but never do BC the location to me is ehh but today I did and am thrilled to come back and check it out for a better more detailed review.  I am a BIG fan of everything FRENCH. French lover, French language and definitely French cooks/food.   They focus on glutin free items and dishes and have vegan options as well. Tastey, light and healthy well portioned dishes. Ohhhh and then to add love for your sweet tooth they have a lovely selection of deserts to finish off your meal.   The service is excellent and attentive as they take pride in their food and all over business and you can really see that.   Nice clean fresh feeling simplistic minimal designed space.   A++"}
{"text":"The decor is simple and modern. The food tastes delicious and presentation is lovely.  I ordered Saturday's seafood special: sea bass with vegetable pur√©e. The skin of the fish was crispy and the filet delicate and seasoned perfectly. Speaking as a CBA, fish here can be a challenge but I found this dish to be delish. While it is not inexpensive Eatt is well worth the money."}
{"text":"Nice and clean this place used to be firehouse subs. They have put in a lot of work place looks great. I had the Ceasar salad wrap which was really good. Also had a pastry which was excellent. Wifey had the tuna salad which was really good. My friend had the ribeye which was really good. A little too much fat was left on the ribeye they could of cleaned it up a little bit, but that's ribeye! The dessert was great as well  Would definitely come back and try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"I think this place is overrated and overpriced. The food blend, literally no taste. Nice presentation, but it does not have taste. The service was ok but we did not appreciate the fact that the waiter was trying to sell way more expensive wine when we already picked the wine from the menu. It was annoying, especially when we asked about the price for the wine that he suggested and he was avoiding to answer. The reason was the his wine was at least 2 times more expensive."}
{"text":"We were luck enough to meet some of the owners and one of the wives- they are all so kind and sweet. The restaurant is really pretty inside, clean lines, light and bright... the staff are so attentive...  and the prices are amazing!! But what you really want to know is how is the food- right!?   The pastries are out of this world- we had 3 at the table and honestly I can't say one was better than the other- they were all exceptional! Broccoli guac w/ gf chips- my gosh... SO good!!! We took home 2 reg croissants and 2 chocolate- I just finished the choc one and it melted in my mouth.   We are going back Monday night for their new dinner menu. Too bad you can't give more than 5 stars- you all deserve it!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Very fresh and most of the vegetables and products they use are locally sourced. The staff are all very professional and welcoming. Top quality dishes for a significantly cheaper price than other restaurants. A must for Vegas locals and tourists alike!"}
{"text":"Sometimes these types of places can be hit or miss- this was definitely a hit. Each detail of my meal was perfect and delicious. At first glance may seem a bit pricey for lunch but totally a treat."}
{"text":"Two of us met to share dishes at this new healthy eating restaurant.  Leaving the restaurant thinking about how good the desserts were compared to the savory dishes is not the best way to remember a meal.  The savory dishes for the most part were lacking in seasoning.  The presentation is exceptionally good looking and make the food something you want to dig into.  When we got to the chicken, we both mentioned about it needing something even just plain salt.  It wasn't until later that I saw on a table where the artificial sweeteners were, there were also salt and pepper grinders.  Too late.  The chicken and later the angus beef were lacking in seasoning.  Moving past the savory dishes and moving to dessert showed where Eatt shines at the present time.  A favorite of mine was the tiramisu prepared and presented in quite a different manner.  The poached peach with a nougat center and sprinkled with some pistachio pieces and the praline puffs were very well executed and were quite good.  The restaurant has a lot of promise.  The chefs are trying different things and the plating is very successful.  The savories need work with seasoning.   The place is very bright and pleasant.  There are a lot of window space that gives the place a nice, lighted interior."}
{"text":"One of my favorite place for lunch. The food and desert are amazing . I love the chicken entry and the paris Brest ( desert). The owners are three french guy.a must go , you will not regret it"}
{"text":"I must admit I've driven by here at least 30 times with a sarcastic  snicker thinking \"Here goes another try for some poor guy in this spot\". Some \"health food\" place giving it a go...im sad to say i waited for my friend to post pictures the night before for me to come into this hidden gem of a restaurant! I immediately  brought me back to a small corner bistro in the middle of France that I haven't seen since my travels overseas. I had to force myself to stop at 3 plates  of small, well executed dishes.   The arugula  salad was fantastic! toasted pine nuts sent this dish over the edge! The beet salad...brilliant! loved the addition of bean sprouts, which i can say...I'll gladly be stealing for my beat salads at home!  finally...The Quiche Lorraine...great balance of flavors.  PLEASE...save yourself the drive down the strip.. the paid  parking and the price X'3 for a quiche. Chef Uri and his staff are spot on!   truly hope this place succeeds!!!!!  Fantastique!!!!!"}
{"text":"It's incredible authentic French food.  Great service and the food.... mmmmm. Lovely ambiance as well. We had lamb and scallops.  Wow"}
{"text":"First off the service was amazing they we're all very sweet and helpful. I had the broccoli guacamole to start I was very impressed lots of flavor and super yummy I also had the vegan rolls (I can't remember the name)  but they were also very good. What I also loved was that the serving sizes were small let's face it we over eat in American and I love not being horrible full and uncomfortable and than we are not wasting :) everything that came out was displayed like art which just shows the care they put into the food here. I will be back and I would recommend this to others :)"}
{"text":"I already good revues about \"Eatt\" but this time its is maybe the best I ever eat. I am Vegan for the past 2 and 1/2 years and I dont remember having such an amazing Vegan meal. I stopped by to try their new menu and I am blown away how good it is. Now all vegan does have a place to eat in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Tried this place thinking it was the \"eat\" from downtown. I am so glad we did.... wonderful casual chic ambience. The sea bass was juicy and the skin was crisp; the tuna and salmon ceviche with capers and dill was a great appetizer to begin this journey of flavors. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"We've been here for lunch and for dinner. Both were wonderful experiences. The customer service was impeccable. The people that work there are genuinely friendly and helpful. Their desserts are superb! I ordered a tirimisu cake for my cousin's birthday and everyone enjoyed it immensely. I look forward to my next visit. I want to try their sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Eatt is tucked away on Sahara among all the dealerships and strip malls.  When you walk in, it's a bit casual, but don't let the cover fool you.  They have fresh food with great presentation, and wonderful customer service!   They change their menu seasonally and have a good selection of different soups, salads and entrees. The only tip you need to know is, save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent presentation is beautiful. The portions are adequate. Desserts are amazing!!! What a gem!!! Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Vegas needed a place like this.  Divine food and wonderful attention to detail.   Please go!  The owner is so vested in his business as well."}
{"text":"I'm not even sure how to possibly describe the incredible dining experience I had here. I was speechless when I finished, which is why it took me so long to write this review.  There were four of us for dinner, and we ordered 5 entrees, and a few appetizers, all to share. There wasn't a single thing that we wouldn't order again. The soups were outstanding the goat cheese appetizer was mouth watering, and the salmon was out of this world! There was a vegetarian entree that was also quite delicious, and the pasta dish was filling without being heavy. Dessert was a whole new level of mind blowing. The passion fruit squares LITERALLY brought tears to my eyes. The coconut chia parfait was good, but couldn't compete with the passion fruit dessert that I tried first. The cream puffs were also quite tasty but again, the passion fruit dessert won my heart and nothing could compare.   I WILL fly to Las Vegas just to eat dinner at Eatt. It is a hidden gem, off the strip, and not pretentious at all. What an incredible restaurant, with staff and owners that truly care about the food they are serving their customers. You will not be disappointed by choosing to dine here over any of the fancy fine dining spots on the strip. Do yourself a favor, and pay the extra uber fare to go to Eatt!"}
{"text":"Just WOW.  Came here at the suggestion of a (foodie) friend. The place is so unassuming and generic outside that we almost passed... what a mistake that would have been!  My daughter had the salmon blinis, and I had gazpacho to start; both beautifully presented and very nice flavours; both decent portion sizes.  She went on to have the filet special; I chose a tartine of goat cheese, pecans and caramelised onion with some magically puffed honey. Oh and the bread is flown in par baked from Paris and is the bomb! We ended with the macaron with apple, and chocolate cake.  I can honestly say that this was in the top five meals I've eaten in my fifty four years, and I have travelled to fifty states and been blessed to have eaten in many very chic and upscale restaurants.  Our server was lovely and prompt. The owner introduced himself and I wished him great success. This is a place you'll be glad to say you went to when it's impossible to get a reservation due to popularity in a few months!  The inside is charming and simple, almost a farmhouse vibe. Do not sit in the parking lot and wonder... get in and EATT!"}
{"text":"Had the impossible burger.  It was fantastic, had a great flavor, texture was similar to a mostly well done burger, some juice but not a lot.  Instead of a bun they had hash browns which was interesting but worked.  The caramelized onions and avocado added a nice touch.  Also tried 2 of the deserts... chocolate cake and passion fruit, both were to die for."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem!! Came here right after having a crappy lunch somewhere else. This place made my day! We started off with dessert first with the praline cream puff and one of their dessert specials. Each dessert had just the right amount of sweetness. We also ordered the Dover Sole which was amazing. It was seasoned, garnished, and presented with perfection! I highly recommend trying this place! Can't wait to eat here again. Oh and I can't forget to mention the awesome service the staff provided! :)"}
{"text":"Went there for NYE and had the special 7 course menu with friends. Smoked salmon with Beluga caviar, lobster ceviche, Angus beef with foie gras sauce, black forest cake dessert... all with great French wines...it was excellent from beginning to end and so affordable, it would have cost 3 times the price on the Strip. If you want to experience high-end French cuisine without breaking the bank, this is THE place to go. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was blown away when I walked in and the guy hurried to the entrance to greet me...he greeted every customer as they came through the door. This IS a small gourmet French restaurant full service but casual dining. Wine and beer selection. Homemade 5-spice ginger iced tea is amazing. I visited 1pm for lunch. They have daily entree specials. Quiet more business crowd than what I expected. I can't believe this gem was hiding right in front of me. My new favorite little spot. Delicious! Chicken with Ratatouille awesome, pork tenderloin was perfect lean and light!"}
{"text":"Delicious restaurant ! Healthy and very good quality food ! Service and restaurant very clean. I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"High quality food! Great service! Fantastic vegan menu and the menu specifies other dietary info like GF...all of it. Awesome place!"}
{"text":"Great food, vegan options available, interior is very modern, staff is very friendly. It couldve been a 5 star but they took my plate and I wasnt even done lol (i eat like a bird and i try to finish my meal slowly, i guess they thought i was done but they couldve asked). Definitely coming back again though!"}
{"text":"Ah, my off-the-road Las Vegas Strip discovery took me to Eatt Gourmet Bistro for a Friday lunch which was very solid:  +Let's talk food first! Thought the food was all-around very good. I got the pork tenderloin which was a fascinating mix of flavors and items mixed with one another from the mixture of a pea puree with the sweet onion-filled filo. I also got their take on a mini-cheesecake. Although I still prefer a regular cheesecake, it reminded me more of a very light and hollow cake filled with jelly once you open it up. Super creative and interesting.  +Also got the cocktail which was a homemade raspberry syrup mixed into champagne which was solid.  +One other food point about the food, the presentation is on point and thoughtful. Loved their take on the jelly-filled cheesecake where it oozed out upon breaking it open. +Personally think the pricing is not too pricey at around $15+ for the entree. With a drink and dessert, it came out to around $40.  Menu items seem to vary from appetizers to sandwiches/salads/entrees/desserts. There's also an interesting spin-the-wheel option that is like a combo deal of random items which was interesting. +Decor is super clean/modern.  +Not too busy at all on a Friday around noon. Was able to easily get a seat.  +Staff is super friendly and informative. The server (sorry, forgot your name!) was very helpful in choosing the right dishes.   +Parking seemed pretty plentiful if you drive. (I came by Lyft from the Vegas Strip which is about a 20-minute drive.)  All-in-all, would love to come back whenever I'm in town. :)"}
{"text":"I have dined all over Las Vegas and Eatt by far is my favorite local restaurant. The cuisine is equal to the most expensive restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip and the presentation is divine. I've never seen such elegantly prepared dishes as offered by their French chef, and the unique and healthy ingredients were a welcome change. It truly is a gourmet dining experience and I recommend everyone to try it. I went back 4 times in 5 days!"}
{"text":"What a slice of heaven.  From the salmon blinis to the special desert (\"in progress\" photo) this place is completely on point.  Great awesome service!"}
{"text":"We stayed twelve days in Vegas and ate ... SIX times at Eatt. That says it all.  We have tried everything on the menu and most of the daily specials and can only say : FANTASTIC.  Fresh, tasty, innovative, delicious.  This is food at its best.  Highly recommended.  My personal favorites were the Gaspacho, the Asparagus Cold Soup, the Broccoli Guacamole, the Ceviche and the Salmon and Tuna Carpaccio. Already counting the days until we are back."}
{"text":"Walking in I didn't know what to expect. Great place top come have a healthy meal after a workout. Very chill atmosphere. And the food is amazing I had the Misov salmon with quinoa, and let me tell you I literally had an orgasm in my mouth. First time eating  quinoa Definitely different but delicious. Thank you Jose for your delicious suggestion.... And thank you for your happy , upbeat personality!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Dinner tonight with my best friend from high school and his wife at Eatt was perfect. They are foodies from Santa Fe so they like fine food and not into AYCE.  Nice ambience,  amazing food,  and great service.  The summer salad blew me away with the flavors and presentation. The green tea dessert is a must.  But my favorite was the ratatouille.  OMG good. Foods served on hot plates and wine service was spot on. Lots of parking and easy to find.   This place is a must try.  On a second dinner last night with foodie friends from Hawaii. Again amazing dinner. The Gazpacho is a must. Our server Jason really made the dinner fun and was so helpful with our friend with a dairy restriction."}
{"text":"Simply does not get any better than this.  Great food, great staff, casual yet refined atmosphere.  I want this in my life as often as possible."}
{"text":"I don't eat out that much anymore. Doctor-imposed dietary restrictions over the last year or so have found me eating a lot more at home. And when I do eat out, it's always tempting to eat the wrong thing (because it's there) or drive everyone nuts with questions about how food is prepared. Eatt (7865 W. Sahara, Las Vegas) appears to know me and others like me.   My first visit exceeded what I thought was possible of a healthy quickserv restaurant. From the crisp interior design and knowledgable staff, to the presentation and taste of the food, Eatt is a welcome addition to the Las Vegas food scene. And one doesn't have to battle traffic or out-of-towners to get there. Located on the west side of Las Vegas, it's convenient for anyone living in Summerlin or a 5-10-mile radius thereof.   As for the food, I started with the Broccoli Guacamole and gluten-free chips. In an inappropriately hyphenated word, out-of-this-world! Thinly sliced cherry tomatoes kept surfacing into my chips, and the taste of broccoli in every bite was pleasantly unexpected.   My sandwich -- on toasted gluten-free bread that did not flake or fall apart -- was marinated salmon, lettuce, mint, and a very thin layer of Greek yogurt infused with dill. Again, amazing!   For desert, I tried (okay, who are we kidding -- there was no \"tried\" -- only slowly devoured) the Macron... a gluten-free almond powdered biscuit topped with light vanilla cream, strawberry and rhubarb. Again, absolutely delightful looking and tasty.   Fronted by two chefs who last year were named Las Vegas' Best Personal Chefs (the two of them were), and a front-of-the-house manager with multiple business degrees and experience working with chefs across Europe, Eatt is a can't miss for anyone requiring or desiring clean food with flare at affordable prices."}
{"text":"The food is nice in terms of taste, quality and presentation. The wines are below par - bring your own! The service is good, except when you get the owner (good looking!) at your table saying he doesn't like it when you send back the watery Pouilly Fuisse or the oxidized Bourgogne. The ambiance is diminished by the TV screens."}
{"text":"Omg this place made my day! The food is beautiful. Beautiful beautiful and tastes as delicious as it is gorgeously plated. So much effort is put into presentation and taste here that you can't help but photoshoot everything and just admire it and eat it slowly as you continue your adoration for their lovely meals. The service matches this and is pleasant, polite and welcoming. They are a delight, and just opened another sister restaurant so be sure to ask about it and check that out too! I grew up in Vegas and am so happy that now when I visit my hometown I can dine at a place like this for a great price. French food is my top fave and they have Michelin star chefs trained in France in the kitchen making works of art with their meals and desserts. I look forward to being in town again and paying this place another visit."}
{"text":"Had the rib eye and capresse salad.wife has quinoa and salmon. Excellent.  Thanks to John Curtas of EatingLV.com for the heads up."}
{"text":"We have passed this place I don't know how many times on Sahara going to and from events. Tonight, me and the hunny needed sustenance.   He was hungrier than I but heaven knows I get my tastebuds involved & I'm in the game. We got the Savory pie appetizer, the Caprese salad, and the special, Lamb in puff pastry with zucchini pur√©e.   Mama likey! Whoever is picking produce has a French fairy godmother at the helm. The heirloom tomatoes and stuffed red pepper make me hate the idea of vegan dinners a whole lot less.   I'm in a lamb phase, this is true. The cut was spectacular, just the right amount of pink. There's a Chinese 5-spice in the pur√©e and au jus and now I want to try everything on the menu. It's those subtle hints that let a gastro gal know the chef likes to play.   We shall return and with appetite!"}
{"text":"This place has 5 stars and 144 reviews? I am amazed... and not surprised at all! Upon entrance we were greeted by a lovely host who brought us to our table. We were excited to hear that the bottle of wine was half off on Wednesdays! Hence wine Wednesday!!! Our server was very kind. He knew the menu and understood modifications. One of us had a severe dairy allergies and the server spoke to the chef who knew there would be cross contamination with dairy so he made an entirely new dish to accommodate us.   We ordered tuna seared, salmon and tuna thinly sliced filet, beat salad, guacamole, 2 desserts 1 being their special with coconut milk and tapioca, and the other with cream both in martini glasses.   The service was phenomenal and more upscale. They sent out fresh plates for every course, ensured our glasses were always full, and were very elegant and knowledgeable about the ingredients. The staff on their team were quality and carried themselves representing the restaurant well.   Overall I love the entire experience from the service, to the food delivery, steps of service in between, and dessert omg. :)"}
{"text":"Beautiful food, atmosphere, and staff.  I love the unique dishes and the presentation is second to none.  I am vegetarian, my husband is GF, I love good wine, and he is a sucker for good dessert.  This place will please and exceed the expectations of anyone.  Eatt is a must try in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Really good healthy food. Clean, tasty and well excecuted!  Underpriced for the quality Will recommand for sure !"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal for true foodies who want to take a break from the strip. We came here for lunch on a Saturday after reading the Eater reviews. We started with the butternut squash soup and artichoke, which did not disappoint. The moussaka with the impossible burger patty was delicious, and the Lamb-orghini sandwich on the Parisian baguette made my daughter very happy. We finished off with the French coffee and award winning Cremo puff. Service matched the high quality food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"All of the food was absolutely fantastic. Zero complaints about the quality of ingredients, preparation, and presentation. Service was also stellar. My only complaint about the restaurant is that half of the seating is high pub style tables and chairs. I got to sit at a normal height table, and every single person that was eating and came in after I was seated chose the standard height tables, I assume, because no one likes pub style tables. If there's some kind of legal liquor license fine print requiring these uncomfortable arrangements I'll hold my tongue. But if MGMT notices a consistent trend here maybe they should swap these out."}
{"text":"As good as it gets for organic selection especially for people with allergies.  Highly recommend the grilled chicken.  The tuna and salmon appetizer is fantastic.  Alot of attention to detail and flavor combinations."}
{"text":"Best onion soup, ever. Incredible goat cheese tartine. The impossible burger was divine. Oh, and the desserts...no words. Excellent service. The chef is one of the very best, I must say!!!!  Don't miss this treat!"}
{"text":"Today we stumbed upon Eatt Gourmet Bistro to find a wonderfully decorated bistro.  Friendly smiles met us at the door.  We were seated immediatly even though we didn't have a reservation..   Our waiter was so friendly and informative. He practically explained the entire menu to us.  Impressive!  Brunch was served beautifully.  Not thinking it was possible the food actually tasted better then it appeared.    Service: on point Atmosphere: beautiful Quality of food:  excellent  Would I return?:  Hell Yeah"}
{"text":"This place is super yummy and I've been here twice so far.   I feel like there's a preconceived notion that healthy food either doesn't taste good but looks good or vice verse, and Eatt has proven that you can have both.   This place is both lovely and relaxing an I have enjoyed coming in here after my workouts. I have not been disappointed or underwhelmed with the flavors. They know very well how to make something healthy but not make it taste like it, and I love that.   The only reason why I'm giving this place 4 stars is because I feel like I'm underdressed every time I walk in. I understand it is a bistro. But they depict themselves as being casual. So when I come in after the gym I feel like I should be wearing my brunch clothes. However, they are super sweet to me and the main guy has been very hospitable  Honorable mention. I love their lemon ginger tea!   Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Randall called ahead of time and the hostess suggested we make reservations. When we walked in, we soon realized we did need reservations. The restaurant was nearly full, and had a modern ambiance. The staff was very friendly. Vegan or not, I would recommend everyone try the impossible burger. It tastes just like real red meat. The burger came with hash browns as buns and that was a nice touch. They had a good amount of wine options. The waiters were attentive and kind. Bag candles."}
{"text":"We had a tr√©s spectaculaire experience at this lovely restaurant! My first impression was...contemporary botanical ambience. The prices are not even that expensive considering the quality they put into display and flavor of each plate. Our server was very amicable and was informative about the choices on the menu. We started off with Summer Salad which was basically artsy slices of cantaloupe inserted with few chunks of watermelon and topped with balsamic chips...BALSAMIC CHIPS!!! Seriously worth the try. And then the main course: I was pleased with my plate which was chicken breast with grilled ratatouille atop a zucchini pur√©e. Yum!! May I say that those cubes of white meat were soft and tender for chicken breast! Our dessert was Macaron (light lemon cream and fresh raspberries) and Exotic (Matcha Tea Biscuit with coconut mousse and passion fruit caramel) ok this one was pleasantly light but was also packing with flavor I almost cried.   Overall I'm so happy I got to visit this restaurant. Very clean surroundings including the bathroom. Bright ambience. Light to digest foods. I left feeling healthy haha. Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"We tried EATT because the owner/founder recently won CHOPPED. We were glad we did. The bistro setting was inviting and comfortable, the wait staff friendly, knowledgeable and professional, and the food was wonderful. Oh, the prices are very reasonable too. We will go back again and bring friends."}
{"text":"Unlike anything I've experienced in this town. Greeted by the owner upon my first visit, extremely friendly and clearly passionate about his craft. And it showed in every part of the restaurant - the decor, the presentation (the chef also came out to greet me), and of course the food. Truly exceptional, highly recommend this place if you want a great experience and unforgettable meal."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Everything that we had here was great!! Their steak dish was was amazing and the price was right!! Oh but the Lamb dish!! Can't say enough good things! I like the atmosphere. Very trendy, modern and spacious!! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This is a place I will come back to time and time again.  I can eat beautifully presented, proper portioned food -- and have a dessert that fits the same bill!  Our group had everything from Salmon, to Chicken Ceasar, to guacamole, to poached peach.  All excellent.  One downside for the moment but being a business person I did not mark them down because I know how challenging it is -- they currently do not have a wine/beer licenses, making evening dining out other than for a great dinner before yoga or meditation."}
{"text":"Came here with mom and dad tonight and parked right up in the front.  We walked in & we really didn't know what to expect but, we're seated promptly at a table on the back.  The room was full and the seats were really comfortable. Although there are no table cloths or or bread service, it's still an upscale experience once you're seated.  The service was attentive, knowledgeable, and amazing (especially Alexander who had time to spend on each item and to expand on all questions that came the table not to mention his knowledge concerning the wine list.)  We went with an appetizer that included asparagus, prosciutto, and shrimp it was amazing.  I also highly recommend the Cornish game hen and the moussaka.  The star of the show might be the impossible burger with hashbrowns instead of bread for the Bun.  Dessert was amazing...props to the Tiramisu.I was just so impressed with every phase, I can't wait to go back as it receives our highest recommendation!"}
{"text":"The 3 young, personable owners include the chef, pastry chef and manager.  The provided menu was more limited than found online, but we had no problem choosing since everything looked so inviting.  We started off by sharing ratatouille rolls that were a delight to both eye and palate.    Each of us chose the wild salmon entry that was marinated in miso and served with beets, apple and soy sprouts.  For dessert, we settled on classic cr√®me brulees that proved to be larger than expected so we would likely share one next time.  This proved to be the best meal of our 14 day vacation in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place definitely surpassed my expectations. Found it by accident and figured a healthy lunch was over due. I ordered a Caesar salad and the goat cheese baguette, both were so fresh, clean and delish. You can tell the quality of the food is top notch by the colors and cuts. I would recommend this place to everyone. Portions are appropriate per healthy guidelines, but for someone used to seconds and thirds this will be too light."}
{"text":"(4.5 Stars) My husband and I are lucky enough that our jobs take us to many of the fine dining restaurants on the Strip and this food quality is on par with them. We decided to try the vegan options (Impossible burger and Moussaka). The Impossible burger was amazing! The Moussaka had delicate pieces in between that made the dish. They also have some handmade (non-alcohol) drinks that are quite tasty! The service was friendly and prompt. Personally, I'd rebrand it (atmosphere, logo, etc.) a bit and I'd think it could push more notoriety, word of mouth, and traffic. Nonetheless, if you want a fine dining meal quality at a good price and friendly smile, great place!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and desserts!! Love the macaroon!! A delight to come in to this restaurant!! Would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I love Eatt Gourmet bistro , my husband and I went there and the food was amazing. We enjoy a really good time on this place. The service was really Nice and friendly. I recommend this place To everyone ! Thank you Chef Yuri , chef Aymeric  and Chef Vincent for all this good food we really had a good evening. We Will be back soon."}
{"text":"This place is probably 4.5 stars for me.  Likes: the service, the dinner entrees (duck breast, and I LOVED the ratatouille), the soups (butternut squash), and the passion fruit dessert (I love passion fruit and guava).  The atmosphere is a clean and simple white linen look, aside from the large wheel you spin if you buy a sandwich combo.  Dislikes:  their lunch time sandwiches.  I wouldn't recommend any of these.  I had the hot dog one and the lamb one, both of which were underwhelming in quantity and taste.    This would definitely be in my rotation to take family and friends after they've tried the iconic places"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the experience at Eatt. Sat outside in their nice patio area and had excellent service from Jess C. Jess explained the menu very well and we ended up getting the chef special of the day. The food was incredible!!!"}
{"text":"I googled Vegetarian restaurants because my daughter-in-law was in town for a convention and I wanted to take her to dinner and she is very limited in what she can eat. When I picked her up at her hotel, she chose EATT from the choices I provided. Wow! The place was new & clean, the service great and the food was wonderful. We shared the broccoli guacamole with chips & the eggplant on buttery puff  pastryfor appetizers and then we both had the salmon with quinoa and beets. The salmon was cooked to our desired medium rare and with the miso honey marinade tasted fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place lives up to its reviews, the quality of food is really good.  They have a little \"spin the wheel\" by the register for percent off or free drink amongst other things.  I do however, feel like it is more pricey for the amount of food you get.  I understand that it's \"gourmet\" but there are other gourmet places that give you plenty more food with the same quality."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place. For the quality of food they put out and it's fresh. Well priced. Great service and beautiful place to eat. All healthy!!"}
{"text":"What a fantasy little place for what seems to be fantastic food and dining experience stuck in a much less fantastic building. We stopped by to grab dinner and our expectations were blown away. The food, service, and staff were great. We left impressed."}
{"text":"I was just driving by and had recently bookmarked this place so I decided to swing in. The first thing you notice is this place is very clean and the interior is decorated in a sleek manor..pleasant. The menu is super limited. The service was attentive and pleasant. I'm just gonna say that I'm not a huge fan of she she French food..but with that said this place offers a nice selection of healthier choices then a lot of places. I ordered the chicken wrap. I'm sorry to say it was extremely bland and uninspiring. It was around 14 bucks and I felt it needed a lot more kick. It came on a plain plate with no garnish. I'm not sure if garnish is just not a French thing but it would be nice to get some sides to come with the sandwhich, that is customary in this country. Overall this place is not my cup of tea. I'm not going to tell them to change this or that apparently there are plenty of people enjoying their food. So I wish you success !"}
{"text":"First time trying this place out. I ordered a $12 Caesar salad thinking it would be at least a medium to large size, although the salad was good it was more of the size of a side salad. After spending $15 with tax and tip for a side salad I left feeling ripped off and still hungry. Salad was good but extremely overpriced for the size."}
{"text":"Such a breathe of fresh air for Vegas - delicious / beautiful / healthy food that is off the strip, finally! Thank Michelin-starred chefs preparing reasonably priced, well plated and creative food in a modern casual setting.  I tried the salmon, which was cooked to perfection and served over a creative mix of beets, soy sprouts and apple. I also had the tiramisu and cheesecake, which were both amazing as well. The owners (Yuri, Vincent and Nicolas) were very friendly and spoke to us at length about their vision and concept. I am so happy for them - definitely looking forward to coming here again!"}
{"text":"So fresh! So delicious! The presentation makes me swoon and the taste...unbelievable. Lunch ANd dinner are amazing so glad I found his place. Everything is light, healthy, and decadent in flavor and plating."}
{"text":"Oh my god. The food is so good. I tried 3 different dishes, and 2 desserts. The place is so friendly and clean and the food is really really pretty, yummy and healthy! I love thus place. Also the price is reasonable! If you go there you won't regret!"}
{"text":"Nice find. Very healthy with something for everyone. Possible early dinner & Sunday brunch without the 'bloat'."}
{"text":"Wow! Excellent off-strip gem for delicious French inspired cuisine owned and operated by owners and Chef from France.   We had a delicious dinner here from start to finish! Highly recommend everything we ordered and we'll certainly be back to try other dishes.  We started with the artichoke & burrata and the beef carpaccio. Both were fantastic. The artichoke dish had a good sized portion of burrata which was a nice surprise. I order beef carpaccio or steak tartare every time it's on a menu so I'm equipped to tell you that this one was wonderful. The chef added little bits of smoked eel which I hadn't seen done before. If you didn't know it was eel, you wouldn't have noticed so don't let that detract you from ordering this delicious appetizer.  For entrees we had the Lamb Wellington which was cooked perfectly and was very yummy and the Salmon. The salmon was also cooked perfectly and was a high quality piece of fish. The nicest surprise on the plate was the spinach ravioli which I expected to be stuffed w/minced up spinach and cheese. Instead, it was stuffed with only fresh spinach! A delightful bite of fresh spinach and house made ravioli as an accompaniment to a beautiful piece of fish.  Sadly, we were too full for dessert. The service was good, quick and efficient.  We can't wait to return. They are also open for lunch which we'll certainly come back for as well.  Before you head to the Strip for a $300 plus French meal, check out this cozy little gem. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"So the French invasion of the west side of Las Vegas continues, bringing delicious, real food with it.  EATT is a casual but nicely decorated space on Sahara avenue. The food is modern French and is bursting with flavor.  Whether a not so simple salad or a complete dinner the dish will have the real taste of the ingredients. I have had the beef and chicken dinners , quiche and salads. All excellent. The baguette is superb as are the creative pastries. I have also found the owners and staff to be very warm and friendly. They go out of their way to make you feel welcome. I highly recommend for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere with healthy menu options. Steak salad was sublime if a bit small for dinner. The special dessert was unique and delicious!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended.  Having driven by numerous times I finally decided to have lunch. I had the Caesar salad with miso marinated salmon which was excellent and well presented. The atmosphere is sleek and modern. The staff is attentive and friendly.  Overall an excellent experience and will not be driving by but instead stopping by more often."}
{"text":"I've always passed by this place everyday on my way home from work and each time I got curious and more curious about it. I finally had the chance to eat here the other day for a friends birthday! And I may say..their food is very much scrumptious! The food is great and the people are great as well  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Wow. The service was outstanding and the food was amazing.  The food was unbelievable.  Went here with 7 other people.  Everyone loved their food. I got soup, which was really good, and the wellington was absolutely amazing. We tried 3 different desserts and they were all fantastic.  I wish this restaurant was in my town. The prices were reasonable.   I suggest the restaurant change its name, logo and outside decor. My friends ate nearby all the time and never went in because they could not tell they would have the experience they would have.  They now plan to make it a local favorite."}
{"text":"Excellent.  I've been there three times already.  The chicken wrap is so fresh and tasty.  The cream puffs are unbelievable. Service is great.  One of my new favorite spots."}
{"text":"The BEST meal I have had. Came in for dinner and ordered the octopus carpaccio the tuna & salmon carpaccio and the summer salad with a bottle of Sancerre. I had an absolutely amazing experience. Every dish was perfectly prepared. Melt in you mouth savor the flavor. Great meal. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Items Tasted: Coffee Croissant Lobster Ravioli in Lobster Bisque Baguette Miso Marinated Wild Caught Salmon with Beets, Apples, Soy Sprouts Chicken with Green Peas, Carrots, Bacon and Broth Black Angus Rib Eye with French Ratatouille Rolls, Beef Sauce Broccoli Guacamole with Tomatoes and Gluten Free Tortilla Shitake Quiche with Leeks, Truffle Oil and Side Salad Poached Peach with Nougat, Pistachio Praline Puff Pastry with Hazelnuts Cheesecake with Raspberry and Yuzu Tiramisu with Mascarpone, Coffee Biscuit, Crispy Chocolate Intense Chocolate Sparkling Cake  Opened by three friends from France just over a month ago, Eatt Healthy Food has been promoted by several in the local industry as a place on the rise, and invited in by General Manager Nicolas Kalpokdjian for a lunch crafted by Chefs Yuri Szarzewski and Vincent Pellerin the restaurant shows signs of inspiration, though the end product still has a ways to come.  Promoting what the restaurant describes as \"healthy gourmet recipes adapted to your diet offered with seasonal ingredients,\" and doing a great diligence in detailing the menu with food allergies, sensitivities and exclusions for dairy, gluten, nuts plus meat, the first impression of Eatt is generated by the brilliant white and clean lines, a modern feel that seems sterile despite plants on walls as well tables while a television hangs awkwardly near the door as though every restaurant in town cannot afford to be without.  Greeted by all three members of the team throughout the stay, one female server assisting with plates, the meal began with a flaky housemade Croissant that rivals many in the city, though the butter-soaked bottom somewhat compromises the shell's integrity while the Chocolate version and Seasonal Danish advertised on the menu were both apparently sold-out.  Told by Nicolas that the restaurant typically offers a few off-menu specials, on this day a delicate Ravioli stuffed with finely diced Vegetables topped with poached Lobster in a Shellfish Bisque, dishes like this show the high degree of technical skill offered by Chef Szarzewski, though unfortunately several to follow would fall short by yielding to \"healthy\" constraints.  Told that the Salmon has quickly become the restaurant's best seller, the thin filet marinated before being placed atop a coil of Sprouts, Apples and Beets, plating at Eatt is unsurpassed at its pricepoint and although a sweeter apple plus some acid may have helped this dish better show the complexity of its flavors it was easily the best entr√©e offered, the Chicken virtually flavorless even with the Bacon imbued Broth while the radiant Ratatouille helped to prop up tender strips of Angus that again had the table looking for a shaker of salt.  A bit disappointed at this point, but finding the vegetables to be highlights of each plate, it was with good fortune that the Mushroom Quiche and a side of \"Broccoli Guacamole\" was requested, the former making good use of the lightest amount of Truffle Oil to accent Shitakes and Leeks in a fluffy Egg Custard while the later was creamy, cool and vibrant on gently salted Crisps.  Appreciating the concept both as a physician and diner, the need for well-priced alternatives to \"quick-casual\" staples like Panera, Chipotle and others something the nation surely needs, it was here that Pastry Chef Pellerin took over the tasting, a poached Peach showcasing the season with a Nougat core and crushed Pistachios in light Syrup while the linear Brest, liquid-centered Cheesecake, Tiramisu and Pure Chocolate Cake were all individually portioned and full-flavored rivals to what several restaurants have to offer at an inflated price-point on the Strip.  *** Acknowledging that healthy means different things to different people, one person's Veganism or anti-GMO Politics irrelevant to a patient with Diabetes following a low-carb diet or the Hypertensive adhering to DASH Guidelines, there is a point where \"taste\" must be incorporated into every recipe, something that the EATT team will hopefully find a way to exemplify while still sticking to the concept they hope to promote."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in town!  The food is beautiful, delicious and made with fresh, healthy ingredients.  I've had the lunch salmon, the butternut squash soup, the dinner duck entree - all fantastic.   Very cute place for a fun lunch or a date night!"}
{"text":"This place blew my mind. Cute atmosphere, very nice staff who knows every little detail about the menu, & excellent food. I wish the price point was a little less but the food is superb and we will be back, and you don't mind paying when it's quality food. The borscht was so refreshing & flavorful. The Salmon was cooked to perfection and the cauliflower salad was amazing. The dessert with chocolate cake and pistachio cream is killer.   Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group for dinner. Everything was delicious. We got a ton of apps because it was our first trip and we wanted to try as much as we could, all were yummy. The broccoli guac was the only thing that didn't do much for me, it was too smooth to be compared to guacamole. All of us got a meal but we could have just done the apps and dessert because the we didn't have room for dessert.   Service was awesome, very knowledgeable staff who was happy to answer questions.   Recommend the ceviche and tuna/salmon carpaccio for sure. It's nice that they have options for vegans as well. Very satisfying for all in the group. Will be back for sure. Next time I'll have to go for lunch."}
{"text":"Delicious and no-frills. Just simply amazing food and service. Get the tasting menu, it is well worth more than $70 (2 apps, 2 entrees, 1 dessert). The beef carpaccio with caviar was stunning. Butternut squash soup was OMG-status. I got to try all of the entrees that were offered thanks to having 4 people in my party. Octopus was my favorite - perfectly tender with the right amount of flavor. And the desserts...which I also got to try 4 different ones. My favorite was the cream puff, which is what the chef is known for. But the passion fruit dessert comes in at a close second. I like lighter desserts and that one was a dream come true. The right balance of sweet and tart. What a great little find. Don't expect bells and whistles but that's exactly why I love this place. And my entire party agrees. MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"The food was plated and tasted amazing!! The only thing we had an issue with was the seating. We were seated at the high table, and the chairs were just a little bit uncomfortable. Other than that though, the experience was amazing! I would definitely love to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"Delicious truffle risotto. Great prices for quality food and amazing plating. Waitress was extremely sweet and kind. She was super knowledgeable and was patient to explain the dishes for us. Intimate, quiet music and relaxing vibes. Will be back!"}
{"text":"As an update- I called back to the restaurant to speak with the owner, thinking perhaps \"this was ALL misunderstanding\", save face kind of thing, you know- people had a bad day!   When told by a women that answered the phone- \" I remember you, I am so sorry for the ordeal you had here\" \"Just for the record, the women you complained about, is no longer with the restaurant\" ...... WOW, so I guess I was not making this up-  apparently this response was BS as their is and was a problem there....LOL  Google the owner- we took it to another level- much broader!"}
{"text":"Eatt is not only THE place to enjoy healthy food, it's also your best option if you are looking for delicious and innovative tastes. Since the quality is incredible, the service is also exceptional. I came two times here, and I know that I will go back very soon. This restaurant will for sure blow your mind."}
{"text":"Sometimes you go to a place and you feel so good about the experience that you want to go back ASAP and bring friends. Then, you go the second time and it is an unmitigated disaster. That was my experience with Eatt. My first stop was with my wife on July 6. We arrived at the opening, were seated by friendly staff with whom we were immediately able to establish a great rapport. We had a magnificent meal - I particularly loved the octopus carpaccio, my wife the gazpacho and the Tuna and salmon carpaccio. We both had a wonderful fish dinner - no dessert, the portions were sufficient, not too much not too little. The list of beers available is limited - none of which I'd rate superior, but in a pinch, I can drink a Stella. They have a few good, wines but the focus of the place is not the wine list - but the food and it was simply marvelous. I could say nothing but good things about it and started recommending it to everyone I spoke to. So ... we went back with friends on July 15. BIG difference in the quality of the food and atmosphere. We arrived at 6:30 instead of 5.00 PM. There was already a sizeable party seated and partaking in their dinner and drinks.  Let's say the table had 14 to 18 people. There were other tables already occupied. The wait staff was overwhelmed. Friendly, sure. But it seemed to me that there was the same number of waitstaff for about 30 people as there had been for half that number. And the service suffered for it. Additionally, the air-conditioning either was off completely, broken or so mal-functional that sweat was literally rolling off the top of my bald head. Yes, it is Las Vegas, and yes when you are seated in a place that has a large window facing West (even though covered) you expect it to be warmer than someplace else, but I don't enjoy going out for dinner and sweating. (Vegas restaurants are usually cold so I wear an undershirt as well as a shirt to make sure I am warm enough.) I ordered the octopus carpaccio, my wife again the gazpacho and the octopus carpaccio as a main. One of our friends ordered the octopus carpaccio as an appetizer. For the main, I ordered the filet of sea bass. I had two forkfulls of the octopus carpaccio and noticed - not the same. It wasn't the moist, fresh tasting appetizer of a few days before. My friend noticed as well that the fish was dry. I figured I'd be able to remedy the situation by getting some olive oil.  It took so long to get noticed (we were seated pretty much in the middle of the restaurant with four people trying to flag waitstaff) that everyone else had practically finished their appetizer by the time I managed to speak to a waiter. I was so agitated that the waiter suggested he bring it back to the kitchen. It finally arrived with the requested olive oil - and by the time everyone else was done with their first course. By now my wife wasn't looking forward to the carpaccio as the main. (My friend had finished his because he was not going to wait too long.) Restauranteurs - if you are going to have a table with a large number of guests, don't have the same number of waitstaff that you have for a normal evening. If you have three people working the tables, you cannot have two maintaining things for the larger party leaving one to rush for the others. My main arrived - and while not \"cold\" it certainly wasn't hot. The underlying mousse substance probably could have been tastier had it been warmer. My fish (surely not the 8 ounces I was expecting) seemed like it just came out from under a heat lamp. In short, my main was more or less tasteless. TASTELESS. Fortunately, they had brought some olive oil out for my wife's carpaccio - also dry, and I was able to put some on top of my fish - so my main did get some flavor, from the olive oil. (Which - was very good!) I wanted to leave, but my friends had their hearts set on macarons. We stayed. The description of the cheese cake sounded good, so I took that - and it was somewhat redeeming. But all and all - a tremendous disappointment. Since the place is three minutes by car from my home, I was looking forward to a place to just go to when we don't want to cook for ourselves. I am reevaluating my thinking. I still will gush over the first visit - which I would rate four stars - and will recant this episode as well to all who will listen. One thing is for sure - IF I ever walk through their doors again and there is a party table, I will turn right around and walk out. A shame really."}
{"text":"I wish i had found this place sooner!!! I came for lunch - the menu is impressive. The space is very modern and clean, and the staff is so welcoming! They really know their stuff. I got a steak salad and ate it too quickly for a photo, but MAN it was delicious and beautiful! I was surprised by the affordable pricing - the food is truly 5-star. I'd pay more for it. Can't wait to go back with friends!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure to eat here and meet the chef/owner.  The place was excellent and one of the very few places the offer the \"Impossible Meat\" product.  The staff was knowledgeable and kind.   The food and service at this establishment will challenge any 4 star restaurant on the strip.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Went there with a friend, she wanted to try this place because of great reviews. It was in between lunch and dinner time so the place was pretty empty. I think the atmosphere is nicer at dinner time when they turn the lights down, it was too bright. Onion soup and artichokes were great, I'd eat it again."}
{"text":"One review I read stated that Eatt was a breath of fresh air... I completely agree!! My husband and I went there tonight for my birthday dinner. He has been once before for a business lunch, when he got home that evening the first words out of his mouth were I have a new restaurant that I have to bring you to! Trust me it did not disappoint!! The food along with its presentation was wonderful!!!!! Loved every single bite from appetizer to desert  Our waitress and here's where I embarrass myself because I'm usually a stickler for remembering names (I think it was Jess) she was Fantastic.. so thank you to her! Chef Yuri personally came out to greet us and asked how our meal was; which we made sure to let him it was fantastic!! Looking forward to going back very soon!!"}
{"text":"Just had the chicken lunch entree and WOW!!  It was not only beautiful to look at but incredibly delicious!  And everyone there  .... just lovely!"}
{"text":"My best description when entering and even during the entire dining experience was like if Apple store had opened a restaurant, this is how I would imagine it with Steve Jobs as servers.  Overall along with the above, extremely clean, well kept, and very attentive.   My rules in a restaurant I never had is always what the servers recommend. The food was good and visually appealing.  So if anyone wants to experience this modern to hipster style decor, drop by and check it out"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!!   Great food, great service, great ambiance.  A bit pricey:  $40+ for lunch (no alcohol) just by myself but it's sooo worth it.  Planning on my next \"me day\" and this is on the line up.  I had the halibut special with carrot pur√©e - delicious!  Love the ginger iced tea!"}
{"text":"Entered this Resturaunt hoping to try something New & Healthy, but instead was discriminated against not seated and decided to leave. I guess black people can only have \"carry out\" as the hosted kept reminded me and my friend that they have carry out instead of seating us. It looked like a nice place to eat, too bad I was welcomed there.   Update since my review:  Spoke with the owner, shared my experience, he advised thy my concerns had been addressed, and welcomed me to come back and try their delicious dishes. I appreciate Nicolas reaching out to me and taking time to listen and take action.  From other reviewers the food is great and the atmosphere appears very open and clean.  I wish Eatt must success and longevity"}
{"text":"What a find!  This is healthy, beautifully prepared and delicious food with great service.  Decor is modest, and it's tucked between a Payday Loan Center and a CVS, but that's why the prices are actually reasonable.  You could transplant this restaurant to the Strip and charge 3x the price, but I'm so glad they didn't.  We had the salmon, summer salad, and a couple of lovely glasses of wine.  Can't wait to go back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Just grabbed the zucchini with veggies. Delicious! Very, very fresh & crisp vegetables. Puree added a nice dressing. I could have this for lunch everyday! So happy you guys are open!!"}
{"text":"I loved this place!  The service, ambiance, and food came together excellently.    The food is healthier and tastier than your average French-inspired menu (I'm not sure if the chef would characterize the food as French-inspired, but I will.  More accurately, l'd say, \"top French gastronomic talent paired with foods from all over the world.\")   I'll add that I haven't seen food plated as attractively as they did here.  I was so impressed, I made a reservation for my wife and me before leaving and I know she'll love the experience."}
{"text":"One of the best local spots for lunch. The venue was spotless, service was excellent and the dishes are mouth watering!"}
{"text":"Impeccable service and amazing food. Some things were a little bland (I felt like everything was lacking a little salt). It was definitely an interesting place though. Wine options were great. More of a lunch/brunch spot rather than dinner."}
{"text":"Very impressive restaurant    Appetizers, soups and desserts are top shelf.  Nice vegan selection.  Entrees are gr8 and so are daily and lunch specials.   Good service and ambiance.  Creative chef so be prepared for culinary surprises.  Prices are reasonable considering the fresh, heathy and original food.  A progressive menu w/good drinks.  Eatt makes it hard not to like it.  French food is the bomb."}
{"text":"Been looking forward to trying Eatt for awhile, but much to our dismay it was a disappointment. Starting with the raspberry lemonade...did not have much flavor of lemonade, let alone hardly any flavor or essence of raspberry.  The Chicken wrap was flavorless although a bit better than the Ham and Cheese on a french baguette.   This was totally flavorless, and the bread was not very good. I've tasted a lot of french baguettes over the years, but this was not good at all.  It tasted kind of like frozen bread from a grocery store.  No garnish on either plated sandwich.  The price came to $30 which was not worth it for a flavorless meal.   Definitely add a bit of salt.   It was nicely decorated and very clean."}
{"text":"If you love Healthy food this is the best place in town! They have Fish, chicken, and beef awesome salads and awesome customer service!"}
{"text":"One of the owners wrote me a very rude reply for critiquing his restaurant in an unfavorable way. I took a Vegan there and she didn't like the food... PERIOD !!! Great way to do business !!!"}
{"text":"Ordered through UberEATS. The mushroom quiche is so flavorful and not too heavy. The presentation of all items is on point...so elegant! The desserts are amazing. The coconut passion fruit dessert is HEAVENLY...wow! So excited I found this place and can't wait to go inside next time lol..."}
{"text":"Legit, high quality restaurant. The term \"gourmet\" is completely abused, but this is one case where it is fitting. I had a special lamb dish with some microgreens and legumes. Extremely tasty. The dessert tiramisu was also outstanding, fresh, not cloying, well-balanced. It's a place I will visit again."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch because of the reviews.  I am giving this place 3 stars for service.  The decor is cute and they have alcohol, not that it is most important but it is a plus! The menu was very limited, so if you're looking for options I wouldn't recommend it.    I ordered the salmon wrap and regretted it.  It is cured and the mayo used doesn't compliment the texture.  I did send it back and ordered the ham and cheese sandwich.  Warning: The ham and cheese sandwich is literally ham, cheese, and bread.  It is not warmed up, it is cold, and tastes like a 3rd grader made it.  The best part of this lunch experience was the tiramisu.    I'm writing this because it could be great, has potential, but they do need to add some things to the menu.  Possibly a new chef.  Love the concept, service was great, the food just needs some love! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite between a late breakfast and an early dinner. Had a simple chicken caesar salad and it was delicious!   I didn't have the appetite for any of the desserts, but they looked great. I can't wait to come back and dig deeper into this wonderful place!"}
{"text":"Get out of downtown and come eatt here! Justin our waiter fascinated us with the description of what was available to eat...all mouth watering. I had the beef tartare and have never had such a mouthwatering rendition..a combination of crunch, pickling, very tender beef. Spouse had a miso salmon and the presentation was very picturesque, along with some little neck clams. Even had room for desert. Very pleased we weren't inundated with the  fill up on bread routine.  Walked out full and not stuffed. Will return to try the chef's tasting menu soon."}
{"text":"Now they open at night, and it's sooo good. Good selection of appetizers, delicious entrees and wine!! Finally a place to have a delicious healthy dinner in an amazing spot. I had the butternut squash soup that actually comes with a delicious mushroom ravioli and the cordon bleu chicken as entree, it was cooked to perfection. If I could give 6 stars to this place, I certainly would!! Bravo!!!"}
{"text":"I could write in entire blog about the ethos, parallels, and symbolism between food/plating and decor at this but I won't. Keeping it short, simple, and straight to the point:  Best French onion soup I've ever had. I don't crave French onion soup but I could crave this one.   Impossible burger: check out the hype. It lives up to its claims.  They will go through the list of dessert but just go with the award winning one.   I love finding new local spots in Vegas. This is a little far out but worth the Uber fare. This place is super reasonably priced for French food."}
{"text":"Easily, hands down one of my favorites restaurants in Vegas.  THE HIGHLIGHTS They were super flexible in adapting the 5 course tasting menu to my pescatarian diet and made sure we didn't have any other dietary restrictions.  The wine pairing went perfectly with the meal; we ended up getting three glasses of white wine, about 8 oz each.  The service was seriously impeccable. Our server was super friendly and warm, knowledgable about the menu, and incredibly attentive. They made sure we enjoyed every dish and slowed down the pace of our meal so we could enjoy our wine (which there was a lot of). I can't overstate how good the service is.  The quality of ingredients, the attention to detail, the presentation, and the flavors are all reasons that make the food amazing.  RECOMMENDATIONS Out of everything, my favorite appetizer was the octopus carpaccio. My favorite entree was the red snapper with zucchini and red pepper pur√©e, and my favorite dessert was the raspberry macaron with lemon cream.  OVERALL The food was deliciously amazing. The wine pairings went perfectly with our meal, and the service only elevated the experience. I definitely, definitely, recommend this place, and I can't want to come back!  TIP: definitely don't skip out on dessert here. The dessert was seriously so good, after trying two, we ordered another to go!"}
{"text":"Love this spot! This is one of my fave restaurant in all of Las Vegas. They have gluten-free, vege-friendly options, but more importantly, they are a super healthy and health conscious restaurant! It's hard to eat out and eat healthy, but not when you come to Eatt Gourmet Bistro!  Let's talk about presentation. A++ here at Eatt Gourmet! They have some incredible menu items and specials that are always fresh and tasty and unique. Just look at the above pics! I love quiches for lunch, and that has been my go-to order here, and it's always served with a fresh little side salad and yummy light dressing.   Portion sizes run a little small, but you're paying for quality food :) Definitely recommend this place!   Decor is clean and modern. Service is super friendly and professional. It's a small shop, but I hear they also do catering :)"}
{"text":"Everyone should eat healthy food.  Unfortunately,  most folks (like myself) enjoy eating unhealthy food.  Well, the last couple of years, we've been eating healthier more often.  So when my niece chose Eatt Gourmet Bistro to meet, my wife and I were quite excited.  You won't find this charming restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip so don't expect to walk here.  They are worth finding if you like healthy eating.  The atmosphere is relaxing.  Staff was attentive and helpful.  Food was on the pricey side.  Not a surprise because eating \"clean\" is not cheap.  So how did the food taste?  I liked the Salmon and Tuna Ceviche appetizer which came with gluten free tortilla chips.  For the price, I thought the portion was too small.  Both the Ham & Cheese sandwich and the Salmon sandwich tasted good.  Honestly, though, we make them better at home using healthy organic ingredients as well.    The desserts that we tried had the \"WOW\" factor which I was hoping for.  Make sure to save room for dessert!!  The Exotic was yummy.  The Macaron was divine!  The Cheesecake with Raspberry coulis was exceptional!!  I am guessing that the desserts are not too healthy, but they are the reason I am giving Eatt 4 stars instead of just 3 stars."}
{"text":"I was only going to give 4 stars because service was excellent but a bit slow, but after our main course was delivered that meal deserved 5 stars. The wait was worth it. We started with the broccoli guacamole and caprese salad. The flavors were amazing and beautiful presentation For our main course, I had the pork tenderloin and my hubby had the chicken breast. It is hard to describe the distinct flavors both dishes had, but incredible. The  pureed sweet peas were so delicious. We ended with the exotic dessert. I will try something different next time on dessert. Overall, very nice experience."}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is very tasty and made from scratch. The butternut squash soup is absolutely my favorite."}
{"text":"We ordered three different menu items they were all beautiful, and tasty.  No one pressured us to buy more and leave faster.  Fabulous food, we chose vegan dishes which we loved."}
