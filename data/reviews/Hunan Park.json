{"text":"I ordered delivery from this place based on good reviews. I was not disappointed! The firecracker shrimp and crab rangoon were tasty, and delivery was super fast. They quoted 40 min delivery window but were here in less than 20 mins. My new fav spot!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. It is a favorite for take out. Quick service when you call ahead with your order and go to pick up. I have not eaten on the restaurant but it looks nice. Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Very hungry had a taste for some sesame chicken i said to my wife  honey will you call a chinese place that delivers   she said that sounds great let's just pick something close by, biggest mistake the worst Chinese food I have had ever eaten,  I'm currently 39 years old. I'm from Miami I eat a lot of Chinese  food if you love your money don't waste it you'll be better off eating out of a trashcan  never taste that before but I feel like I tasted it tonight  1 they delivered on time"}
{"text":"The place was really nice, clean and quiet. Even during lunch time.   I got the shrimp and broccoli lunch special. It was really good! The vegetables were fresh and crunchy. The shrimp was very plentiful and well seasoned. The fried rice was good, not dry.   The people were very nice as well."}
{"text":"Although I haven't eaten at this place, I have ordered from here quit a few times. The delivery is always quick and the quantity is good. Forgive me meat eaters,but I've only tried  the vegetarian items from their menu, but whatever I've tried has been really good.  I especially like their Singapore Rice Noodles. Some of the better Chinese food I've had in Charlotte.  I will update my review once I get a chance to finally go and eat at the place."}
{"text":"I had to do quick carry out for me and my wife. They don't give silverware and napkin. When I asked give me one. I asked for extra napkin but the lady don't even want to give any. No smile no thank you or anything. Like I am getting food from machine. Have not tested food yet but Never ever again from this place for this kind of service"}
{"text":"Tried for the 1st time last night. I haven't had kung pao chicken this good in 20 years. wife had the moo goo gai pan and raved about it too. Takeout. Will def become a regular patron."}
{"text":"ROACH IN FOOD!!!! beware of this place, and they didn't even offer to refund us for our meal, and blamed the ROACH on us. this place was our top Chinese spot, but never again! we had our family from out-of-town dying to eat here with each visit. i will live out my days telling warning everyone of the dead ROACH  my wife found in her lunch. Think twice before ordering from this place, unless you enjoy the extra crunch and protein from ROACHES!"}
{"text":"Food is very good. They are also very quick to get your rake out order ready. I would five them 5 stars if only their fried rice was like what you find in NYC or Miami. But this is still the best Chinese food in the area by far."}
{"text":"Best chinese food delivery in the University area!  I have tried many of their dinners and have loved everything I've tried here."}
{"text":"Delicious Chinese food! The veggies are fresh and chicken is good, same with the sauce. The sauce didn't taste like it was out of a bottle.Only wish that there were better prices, that is the only downfall that would prevent me from coming back."}
{"text":"This has replaced Chia Bistro as our go-to take-out place.  The food is tasty and seems relatively fresh for Chinese delivery/take-out.  Prices are competitive and delivery is fast, even in Friday night traffic.    The spring rolls and beef and broccoli are tasty and filling, with plenty of veggies.    If you live in or near Highland Creek, give these guys a shot!"}
{"text":"Alright so I tried this place based on the reviews, BUT clearly here needs to be more reviews because this place was terrible. The only thing good about it and other people were right on was the good was ready quick! But I ordered the beef szechuan, and it was like the had no idea how to make it, and just threw a bunch of vegetables together and duck sauce! And called it a day, WHOA it was bad. And the wonton soup tasted like cardboard (no joke) worse place I ever been to, never going back  (2 stars based on fast service)"}
{"text":"On a recent visit with two colleagues of mine, I was introduced to this gem hidden in a strip mall known to locals as Hunan Park.  The food is quick, tasty, and cheap.  If you're looking for a casual dining spot on your work break or trying to grab something to take home for the fam, this is your spot.  HP keeps it real and you should too."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years since they first opened and it's always delicious! The lunch special is a great deal! I've dined in, had delivery, and take out, every time they come through with great food and service! I love how quick they are with their orders. Hands down some of the best Chinese cuisine you'll ever have. As long as I'm living in Charlotte, I'll be eating at Hunan Park. Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Super fast delivery! This is the first time I've ordered from this Chinese restaurant. The food is tasty. I am not a fan of their egg rolls or spring rolls. There is way too much celery in both of those to make them appetizing. But I enjoyed everything else. Will order from them again."}
{"text":"Located near Highland Creek, the restaurant is actually facing Ridge Road. This place is a little hard to find, it's in the strip mall down on the side. It's worth the effort. I have lunch here often. It's always a friendly place to dine. Unfortunately, they are not usually very crowded. They do a good take out business though. They have very fast service, so it's a good place to go if you are in a hurry but want to sit down for a few minutes. They have the hot mustard, sweet and sour sauce and soy sauce at the table.   My favorite thing here is the hot and sour soup; it's some of the best I've ever eaten. The hot tea is fresh and takes a while to brew... I usually end up drinking it at the end of my meal. The portions are fairly large even at lunch. Everything is clearly marked on the menu as hot if it comes that way.  I unusually order the chicken or shrimp Kon Bo I think it's the best thing on the lunch menu. I do like it spicy. They cook it when you order, like most Chinese restaurants.  Recently, I've been trying other dishes here. Fire Cracker shrimp is very good. It's even better at dinner time. At dinner, they encircle it with barely cooked broccoli, just the way I like it. The beef is always very tender in the dishes and is cut to just the right size.  I don't particularly like the dishes that have breaded chicken. Some of the pieces are tough and seem to be over cooked. There is more breading than chicken. If I had to guess it's breaded ahead of time then cooked in a deep fryer and the oil is really hot. It has a good flavor just too overdone for me."}
{"text":"*Disclaimer, I am a huge foodie*   Strike one, two and three - their chicken is not all white meat. Yuck. I ordered General Tso chicken today after reading the great reviews about it and was sorely disappointed. The chicken was tough and primarily bread. Definitely not the quality of Chinese food that I'm used to. The sauce and rice were good and the lady that answered the phone was very friendly, so I gave 2 stars for that.   I will not be frequenting this establishment."}
{"text":"Dinner entrees are not quite as cheap as other cheap Americanized Chinese places, but the quality is a little better than most.  I looked around as I walked in and saw there was some effort into decor, but I did not pay that much attention.  They have a happy family entree, but for a couple bucks more you can have it with Lobster and beef.  It was pretty good, but I'm not sure if I like the idea of eating Wang's special sauce, lol.  I also got the general Tso's twin delight.  Basically a chicken and shrimp version.  Both were above average.  The soups were all fairly priced and tasty.  No real complaints on anything other than 2 entrees, 2 soups and a crab rangoon was $37."}
{"text":"I'm new in town and was looking for a good Chinese place near my house. Was excited about this one because it had 4 stars on Yelp. The staff was nice and the food was fast, but overall it was mostly flavorless. I got crab rangoon, wonton soup, and chicken lo mein. All of it was pretty bland for what I expect of Chinese food. I had higher expectations for a four star yelp restaurant, but the food I got was just meh."}
{"text":"Looking for eat in Chinese - and NOT a buffet.  Pleasantly surprised.  Not many tables filled so service was very good.  Food was great! We've been in the area for a little over a year and this is the first independent restaurant that reminded us of the NJ taste we used to enjoy.  Hot and sour soup was nice and tangy with a hint of spicy.  Moo shu pork was good - prefer the cabbage sliced really thin, but theirs will do.  Also wonton soup with 4 little tender dumplings and beef and broccoli not bad!  Portions were large - leftovers for lunch.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Whoever is working the phone needs to learn the English language. Especially numbers. After saying my phone number 4 times & 3rd try on my address I just gave up. They apparently need an online ordering option. Would recommend getting delivery somewhere else."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a really good Chinese food place in the area, I haven't had luck with the others, the food quality just hasn't been there. We tried Hunan Park last night and were not disappointed. We live 0.9 miles outside of the delivery radius (boo!) so pick-up it is for us, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite crab rangoons- lots of filling and a great crispy shell. My family always gets the shrimp and broccoli and garlic sauce and its the best shrimp and broccoli in the area.  Delivery is fast and prices are reasonable and my food always gets to be piping hot."}
{"text":"I love this place ... The food is incredible . The service is fast . And the presentation is fantastic. Try the house specialties . The chicken and walnuts is divine . This place is a hidden gem ."}
{"text":"I am very skeptical of chinese restaurants, very skeptical.  I've been let down many times, from bad meat to food poisoning and for that reason I stayed away from chinese for many years.  I took a chance on Hunan Park after having an urge for fried rice and thankfully they didn't disappoint.  The veggie fried rice is always fresh, and full of veggies.   I usually stick with the rice only, but recently I took a chance and tried the veggie rice noodles and it is awesome as well.  I think I will stick with the veggie dishes for now, I don't want to press my luck."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area. And this is the only Chinese place that I like that delivers. The food was always hot and fresh Everytime."}
{"text":"This is like the only chinese restaurant that delivers near me and I am not a fan of the sesame chicken. It doesn't taste fresh and i've exerienced better tasting chinese food. Their crab ragoons are good but they do not come with the red sweet and sour sauce for dipping.  I am going to have to find a better chinese spot."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food at a decent price!  We always have good food here. Hubby and father in law had the General Tso's chicken, I had the chicken teriyaki. All cooked to order and no issues. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Another great chinese option, for neighborhood locals...  Had to try to Crab Rangoon and feel it's one of the better preparations of this appetizer.  General Tso chicken was flavorful and the sauce was more savory than sweet, so no complaints there.  The \"Wang\" house special was a standout, having heaping portions of meat, seafood and vegetables...I'd comeback for this dish alone.  Lastly, the egg rolls, while slightly smaller than usual were flavorful with a hint black pepper, perhaps?  *Mention must be made about the restaurant itself, and that it's cozy and a good sit-down option for families."}
{"text":"This is our go to Chinese take out place! It is close and tastes good. Just wish they didn't do just dark meat for the chicken and wish the dishes were spicier. We ask for it to be spicier and it never it. Other than that, the food is great and quick."}
{"text":"Our 'go to' restaurant for Chinese close to home! Must haves are their Vegetable Lo Mein and Special House Fried Rice!!"}
{"text":"LOVED IT! The shrimp with veggies was everything..the Chinese donuts were warm sweet and fresh, will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"My go-to Chinese take-out place when I'm in that part of town.  They have been there for a while and they know what they are doing.  Every dish I've had from there has delivered.  The portions are hardy, the prices are affordable and the sauces and flavors are excellent.  Excellent neighborhood Chinese food spot!"}
{"text":"Pro: Very large portions!  You definitely get your money's worth here.   Contrary to what others said, I thought the flavor was great.  My spicy dish wasn't very spicy, but that was just fine with me!  Con:  The chicken was very chewy, almost as if it was reheated or sat under a heat lamp too long.  It was edible and I did eat it, but I probably won't be back for that reason.  It wasn't just a few pieces either... most of the pieces in my dish were very chewy."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese cuisine, very good food.  I prefer to order the Egg Fu young to test a Resturant capabilities and they pass the test. Brown sauce is not lumpy and under seasoned. The egg is perfectly cooked with the meat generously per portioned. Rice is easy to eat and easy on the stomach.  Nice spot to eat at, clean and eye pleasing. The owner needs some customer service training, but the food is worth the lack of customer service capabilities."}
{"text":"I was a little let down when I ordered the Bang Bang shrimp and got curry. I expected something similar to another dish by the same name. But the hunan shrimp is great."}
{"text":"This place has the best general tso in Charlotte. My boyfriend is a huge fan of the shrimp rice noodles (I have to admit it's pretty great) Don't generally see many people eating in the restaurant but they are always busy with take out orders. I have done both take out and eat in and the food has always been great. The staff is also nice and polite."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in the highland creek area! Their lunch time specials can't be beat! They give you an enormous amount of rice, the Hunan beef is outstanding all around a great place!"}
{"text":"Freshly made Rangoon. Egg rolls with meat and not just chopped cabbage. Hot and sour soup to save my head cold. This is the best Chinese I've had 10 years.  Wow. It's really good.  It is not delivered frozen and cooked.  So glad I stopped here. Will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite take out restaurant as it is so close to home. They are in the same building as the Harris Teeter at the Shoppes at Highland Creek. We have never dined in, but whenever we have ordered for pick up, they get our order ready before the time they tell us. We are really big on their shrimp in garlic sauce and the fire cracker shrimp. Also, their hunan chicken is amazing. Basically nothing we've had here has been anything less than amazing. I'm so glad these guys are close by!"}
{"text":"Ordered a lunch to go. I had chicken in garlic sauce with an egg roll. The egg roll was just the right amount of fried and very juicy. The chicken was in a sauce that was bright red for some reason. I'm assuming it was from the chili? No matter why it was red, it was delicious. I would eat here again without a doubt. For under $7, I had a filling lunch that didn't upset my stomach. Success!"}
{"text":"Delivery was really fast. The food we ordered was all over cooked. The sesame chicken was crunchy and dry. The wontons and crab ragoon were too crunchy. We ended up tossing the crab ragoon. The only thing that was good, was the fried rice."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE WAS DELICIOUS. I'm here on a business trip for a few weeks and this will be the only place I eat from. I got the chicken and broccoli and my friend got the Hunan chicken and everything was made fast and fresh it was absolutely delicious. Flavorful and a good sized serving I will definitely be coming back. This is the BEST Chinese I've had in a while."}
{"text":"I was not impressed at all, the chicken was old. Almost tasted like it was reheated, overlooked and dry. Not sure that I'll try this place again."}
{"text":"I ordered from here out of desperation for delivery.  I ordered Pot Stickers (the only good thing) Mongolian Beef and Orange Chicken.  The beef had large veins of grizzle running down almost every bite.  The breaded chicken was so tough I couldn't finish it.  It was as if they took some frozen, breaded chicken out of a freezer from months of sitting and microwaved it on high until it was over cooked.  I am writing this at 4:24 am because I can't sleep due to the queasiness in my stomach that has lasted roughly 8 hours.  Being a slave to the limited delivery in the Charlotte region certainly takes it's toll."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and decided to try this place one afternoon because most people seemed to like it.  Let's just say I was pretty disappointed.  The prices are ok, portions are pretty big, but the flavor and quality of the food wasn't as great as I anticipated.    I got the lo mein (surprise, I know) and it noodles were very thick, I like the more thin ones.  It was completely dry although I even asked for extra sauce.  My sister had the Kung pao chicken and the pieces of chicken were not cut up like they normally are. The dish was mostly a sea of endless broccoli and light on the chicken.  The flavor was not like others we have tried.   They were pretty busy and there was somewhat of a wait to pick up my food.  The employees were nice."}
{"text":"This is your one-stop Chinese takeout shop!  Hunan park never disappoints, and they always have your order ready super quick.  I highly recommend the general tsao's chicken.  If you order takeout for dinner be sure to ask for utensils or have your own. Overall, solid across the board!"}
{"text":"I live near Hunan Park and was excited to see a Chinese restaurant that delivers near my house. Not only is the food good, but their delivery service is quick and efficient! They have consistently arrived under the expected time (45 minutes) and my orders have been right. This is a great alternative when I don't feel like cooking. I usually order egg drop soup, crab ragoon, and chicken lo mein. Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious and they deliver. They are extremely understanding of allergies, reasonably priced and quick. We love their food!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch value, quality food, great service and place was very clean when I ate there today. No complaints from me at all and now one of my favorite restaurants."}
