{"text":"We waited 30+ mins for the food to come around and the stay was 1.5 hours long. After that, we got a bill of $98.75. I swear it was a week day, dinner time and it cannot cost us that much (around $25 per person, that's not the price they listed).  We called the manager out to ask why there is a charge of 10% even though on the menu it stated the charge is applicable if there would be 6 or more people in a party. THERE WERE 4 OF US, NOT 6. She doesn't speak a lot of English and we do not speak Chinese, so we quite did not get what she was saying about the charge. At the end, she gave in and told us \" our employees work very hard\" and used that as the excuse of why she would charge us 10% extra. We finally understand that they DISCRIMINATE us because we are young. They thought that if they charged us 10% more right on the bill, they would make sure we left them some tips. They obviously do not want to have customers coming back since we know better AYCE sushi places to go and lying or trying to make short term business like this is a waste of time."}
{"text":"So I checked this place out today and needless to say, I wasn't surprised. They do not serve sashimi during lunchtime, only sushi which tasted average for the area and nothing special. I didn't really like the makis because the seaweed they used tasted strange and had a very chewy texture. It was so hard that I had to break the rolls apart because I couldn't chew through the seaweed! The buffet which was included in the $10.99 all you can eat lunch wasn't even worth trying. I should have known better..."}
{"text":"My first one star review, what a ghettoass buffet. I grew up around this area so I used to come here with my friends a lot when I was younger, I came back for the first time in 3 years and wow, foods are horrible all around. Sushi do not taste like sushi. They need to shut this place down."}
{"text":"Not bad food for okay prices.  Don't really recommend the buffet but the made to order is good."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE the food was horrible no selection to choose from ice cream was good and the sushi. The place is filthy the ice cream freezer is caked with shit and the rice cookers are filthy ..like black caked on"}
{"text":"The sushi there is devine, and the service is great especially if you are eating sushi for the first time."}
{"text":"So, I arrived between lunch and dinner, round 3pm. There was a staff member sleeping on one of the benches, but get it when you can.   No chopsticks on the table, had to ask. No Ginger with the food, again, had to ask, and got a giant clump of it. My call for no roe on the sushi pizza went unheard. Not major complaints, but they add up.   The sushi mediocre to my moderately experienced tastes."}
{"text":"Nothing special.  Rolls are usually large/quite ricey.  Quality is okay, nothing to complain about.  They do AYCE but we've never had it, they have a really weird set of hours restricting it that just don't make it practical for most.  They offer delivery which normally arrives fast enough.  Good fall back place when nothing else is available or you're looking for delivery."}
{"text":"Prices not bad, quality and selection of food for the most part horrible, customer service half decent.  M'lady and decided to try this venue for a bite to eat when we were starving, figuring that AYCE (all you can eat) would be a good way to go.  The prices for an AYCE dinner of $19 weren't bad and their walk-up buffet selection seemed some-what alright, plus we had the option of ordering sushi from the menu (sashimi is always an extra $2 both at lunch and dinner), so we went for it.  The only vegetables they had at the buffet were cold, but the rest of the food wasn't bad. Then when placing our order for the sushi, the server missed part of the order due to being distracted by one of her co-workers across the restaurant which wasn't very pleasant. Regardless when the sushi arrived, I had a number of piece of it, and I started feeling sick to my stomach, so I decided to stop before it was too late. I was hoping we wouldn't be charged for the pieces we couldn't eat. Some of the pieces looked so slimy and unappealing, that we were convinced that if we were to try a piece, we'd be ill.  So with that in mind, I'm not risking going to this venue again, as I've gotten sick after eating bad fish before, and it's not pretty."}
{"text":"I just left Oishi Sushi and it was the worst Japanese food and service I have ever experienced! The food they served tasted like it was sitting there overnight and like the chef was an amateur. Their desserts tasted stale and flavorless. Even my daughter said she wanted to throw up because the food was so bad. The service was horrible. Save your money and eat out of the garbage bin instead."}
{"text":"Wow! I remember seeing this place open up near my apartment. Didn't look like much but me being the way I am insisted on trying it. Apparently it's everything I ever dreamed of: asian buffet (good quality food as opposed to the crap you find on most asian buffets), and ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI!  When I found out about the ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI I kinda felt unnerved at the idea, presuming it would most likely be pretty gross. Man was I ever proved wrong. I have eaten in a lot of Toronto's sushi joints and this place definitely has some of the best sushi in town.  As for the environment it is very clean. Washrooms are beautiful. Servers are all very nice when you can get their attention. Though they have gotten better. When we first started going in we were some of their first customers so we got astounding service. When the pace started to pick-up though we noticed the quality of service diminish. But they have made some good improvements. They're a new business so I'll give them a break this time I guess.  If there were any quirks about the place I'd have to point out it would be their hilarious selection of music. Some nights you will go in and it will be good ol asian music straight through. But other times we have been in there you get the classic asian music mixed with unbelievably random songs ranging from forgot about dre (Dr. Dre and Slim Shady) to what I think was a bootlegged Iron Maiden song.   All in all one of my favourite spots in the city if your looking for a good meal for an awesome price.  Speaking of price, lunch is from 1100-1600 and costs $10 for the buffet. After 1600 its $14. On weekend add $2 to both of those prices.  Also, Oishi Sushi was just recently licensed to serve liquor and their beer is dirt cheap at less than $4 a bottle (domestic)!!!  If your ever up in the Downsview area be sure to hit this place up. Would recommend over any Wasabi and maybe even over the Mandarine with Oishi Sushi introduction of Crab Legs to their dinner buffet!"}
{"text":"Oishi is somewhere that my family and I visit on a semi-regular basis. Tonight was probably our 4th time this year. We go not because the food is great but because they have a good variety of food (including crab legs) at a relatively cheap price.   Tonight was no different, the food, as usual, was alright...there was only one small issue...my husband got a couple of these whole fried shrimps or prawns from the buffet area and when he cracked the first one open this blood or blood like liquid shot out and went everywhere. It was all over his hands and the floor, almost hitting the table across from us. He was so turned off he didn't want anything else to eat. I don't think we'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The only reason why I go to ayce sushi places is for their white tuna,salmon and bbq ribs. The first time I came here,they had the ribs out on those buffet lanes(idk what its called) and I could take as much as I wanted.I was in heaven.But on my second visit,they didn't have it out and when I asked one of the servers if I could order some from her,she promptly said \"its over there\". Well it's not there which is why I asked. The freshness of their sushi is a hit and miss.The white tuna wasn't very fresh the first time but it was quite delicious the second time I've been there. You can order sashimi for lunch for an extra cost of $3 (which I think is worth it). The servers aren't overly nice but they certainly won't be spitting on your food or ignoring you when you need something. This is the place to go if you don't mind mediocre Chinese food and sushi and you're starving."}
{"text":"Most of the sushi rolls here are mediocre.  The Crispy Volcano Rolls are the only ones that I consider slightly above average.  Their mango slushis are noteworthy if you prefer to accompany your meals with a sweet beverage.    Stay away from the Chinese buffet section though.  Their selection appears dried out and stale because they've been sitting under the heat lamp for too long.  On the positive side this restaurant offers a 10% discount to post secondary students only if paying with cash."}
{"text":"I've been here once and really enjoyed it. Our server wasn't very friendly. The selection is decent and the buffet part is good. I would visit again."}
{"text":"I had noticed for sometime that people at my workplace were ordering from this place, so I decided to try them out for a change.    Ordered my all time fave spicy crabmeat roll with avocado, and crunchy stuff that I have yet to tell exactly what it is.    Ordered arrived in decent time and appeared to be a lot for what we paid for still.     It tasted just as good as I had anticipated,  but had a textured feeling as you placed it in your mouth that it had been sitting there for sometime.    Probably won't be difficult to decide ordering again.."}
{"text":"Sorry to everyone below me, but this is the WORST sushi place I have ever been to.  I would rather eat sushi from a gas station than here.  I have given this place many chances, but it is always nasty.  The rolls are chock full of rice and not much else.  The buffett (I'm not a fan of places that have the food lying out like that) is always half empty and nothing is delicious.  Oishi Sushi must be avoided at all costs.  Speaking of, they've been lowering their prices steadily for the past year or so.  Hint hint?"}
{"text":"I know that some of you on here have given this place great reviews, I was just there over the weekend with my family and maybe I got there on a bad day.   The sushi was soggy; the salmon tasted like it was old or stale. I felt that the service form our server was not very good! I am so surprised at how terrible this place was for me!"}
{"text":"$11.99 for AYCE sushi lunch on weekdays. This alone seems to be enough to draw in crowds from York University and it's surrounding areas. Situated on the construction-ridden intersection of Keele and Finch, Oishi Sushi's price is unfortunately its only draw.   The buffet includes AYCE sushi as well as a Chinese section in typical self-serve buffet fashion. Neither section includes particularly good food, and the selection of sushi is very limited when you're not ordering from the dinner menu. The dessert section is a complete joke as well.   Because it's so close to campus, I may eventually return for lunch here and there, but I definitely do not recommend Oishi Sushi for people looking to get a good meal."}
{"text":"Really bad service here. Ordered for delivery and it took 2 hours for our food to come and the entire order was wrong !!! The sushi and sashimi had a stale bad taste and not good. The salad was OK and the cooked food was too salty. We called to complain and they didn't care no apology they just applied a 15% off for next time order. We will not be ordering or eating here ever again. Save yourself the time and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"It's late, I'm tired as usual I will update later.  Been here at least 10 times. I'm a fan! Good pricing for all you can eat sushi + buffet. Good green tea, and I love the facility, especially when you consider it's less than savory location. I highly recommend it, even for groups. Service is always decent, never great. Also, nicely done bathrooms, very elaborate.  I will surely go again, and perhaps see you there.  The biggest negative I have for this restaurant is probably the same as every sushi buffet - the desserts are awful, tough, and non-edible. Enjoy the ice cream and some of the fruits, avoid the hard jello, and hard pastries."}
{"text":"the avocado had the consistency of a carrot. When I called back to complain I was told this is \"Seasonal \". I guess one expect complete mediocrity during certain times of the year!  Close the place down!"}
{"text":"My experience at Oishi Sushi was terrible. A friend and I are students at York U and decided on trying a AYCE Sushi place because we kept on getting flyers from there. The incentive for students to go here is the 10% off if you pay with cash.  It seemed really dead and there was barely anyone in there. The staff member didn't ask us anything and merely pointed to a seat. The place was not clean, and had flies buzzing all around. Ordering the food, the sushi was NOT properly rolled and would break apart when I picked it up with my chopsticks. The salmon roses were also very poor, the sashimi was NOT fresh.  The employee wasn't very alert in doing his job and would take out his phone from time to time and go for a smoke. There's nothing wrong with a smoke break, but coming back to your work environment smelling like smoke and touching my food is a different story.  I asked the employee for a napkin and he gave me water, I asked again and he gave me more water. Eventually I had to get my own napkin.  I wouldn't recommend the place.  1/5"}
{"text":"I have ordered from Oishi several times and always been fairly satisfied with their food. The language barrier between the staff and their customers (those taking my order and delivery persons) has always been a pretty big issue, though. The food is sometimes very good, other times very mediocre but we have always liked the place....UNTIL  Last Saturday night we made a fairly large order as we were with friends. The delivery was said to be there in 45 minutes, it was an hour. Whatever. So the delivery guy comes, and brings in one bag full of our food. I went to take the bag from him but he stepped around me and put it behind me - this made me a little uncomfortable but whatever. He rushed me and dropped my change but I still tipped him well. Whatever.  So I watch him drive away as I lock my front door. Minutes later this guy is calling me on my cellphone YELLING and I can't understand a thing he's saying. After quite some time of him yelling some more I figure out that he's trying to tell me that I took too much food...like some one elses order. I checked and re-checked with the group, everyone got what they ordered - nothing more nothing less. So i tell the guy and he hangs up on my abruptly.  Next thing I know he's ringing our front doorbell again and again and again FRANTICALLY. My friend goes to the door because I don't like confrontation and wanted to finally start eating my meal. He demands to see me so I go and he starts accusing me of stealing another order of food. He said that he brought two bags into my house and said he would be right back for the second bag. This is entirely false  1) Why the F#$K would you bring a different persons food into my house (his car was right outside) 2) He drove away after I paid him so clearly he wasn't coming back for this imaginary bag of food.  He then proceeded to call me a liar, and swear at me. I tried to calmly explain that there was some mistake but he left, still yelling, saying never to order from his business again. I was upset and irritated so I called the restaurant back immediately. I was not overly upset sounding but I tried to explain to the man who answered what had just happened. Obviously the delivery boy had already called because I got yelled at some more by this other man. Then I began to get upset. I told him that I was calling because I was accused of something I did not do and that I liked ordering from this place and I wanted to continue. The man kept repeating himself - no one would believe me (this was the owner) so he told me not to order from there again and hung up on me.  Needless to say this experience has ruined this places reputation in the eyes of some very loyal customers and their friends. I am appalled by the behaviour of this delivery boy AND the fact that the owner would back him up over a paying customer. Obviously this guy messed up hard and I got the crap end of the stick.  If I could give Oishi Sushi ZERO stars out of five I would. If I could give you any advice, it is to order from somewhere else. I will never be a loyal customer to a place that does not value the truth."}
{"text":"It hurts to one-star you, Oishi, but you've really gone downhill....  I used to come here a lot during my first few years at York University. It was a popular joint for students. The AYCE lunch price was music to our student-budget ears ($10.99... though it's now $11.99), and the sushi was pretty darn good. Not amazing, but good enough and nicely rolled.  Fast forward three years... I came in with a friend around 9pm. The place was totally dead, and so was the brain of our waitress. We put in our order right away, and she brought us three hand rolls that we didn't order. She later brought us a plate with half the rolls we'd ordered... But we still managed to fill our bellies up with those, because they were SUPER rice- and cucumber-heavy. I could barely see or taste fish :( She never bothered bringing us the other half.  Utter poppycock."}
{"text":"This place will give you horrible food poisoning. Beware. Put it on your black list."}
{"text":"I dont know if it was bad because we came in a little late (around 830-9p) or if it was generally that bad. my boy and i were psyched that it was a Mandarin and Sushi buffet because a) we LOVE sushi and b) we have people who wanted to eat at the Mandarin (a few blocks away) - so that was like hitting two birds with one stone.   the Mandarin buffet didnt have much when we got there.. (replenishing would be a good idea, guys!) and the rolls we ordered, Red Dragon and Oishi Sushi were ok.. red dragon deserves it's own star.  we ordered some sushi pieces and we had to order it 5 times before we got the order in!   the second star is for the effort. I don't know how new this place is - it has potential. maybe better sushi service and more mandarin choices. will i go back? we'll see."}
