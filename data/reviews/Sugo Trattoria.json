{"text":"not bad but not good. wouldn't go back to eat, there's way better italian around here, haven't tried dancing there since they changed the name from voglie so maybe that's good."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent, food and service alike (Michael). We'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"I went in perhaps a month ago with a friend. From the moment we stepped in, the server's exaggerated ebullience was in our face. Fine, he's really into his job, ok.   I had a glass of wine and my friend a bottled beer.  We started with the Arancini, which are risotto balls filled with Fontina and served with their Sugo sauce. Interesting idea that got me intrigued right away. The positive is that they weren't oily, the negative is that they were bland and we needed more Sugo sauce to spice it up.  I then had the Matriciana, which is gnocchi with piccante sausage in their Sugo* sauce.  I found the gnocchi quite mushy, there was barely any sausage and it needed more sauce or maybe I should've added more parmesan. Lots more.  Mediocre plate overall.  But I shouldn't complain because my friend had the Sugo* con polpette, which is their spaghettini with handmade meatballs in their, once again, Sugo* sauce and it was so bland. The sauce was nothing different from what you can get out of a jar and we were hoping for something different in their handmade meatballs, but they were just... bland. It really became a chore to finish.  We hoped to finish it off on a high note with a classic dessert, the tiramisu, but that was even more disappointing. There was no distinct flavor of espresso, the chocolate glaze added this weird taste of sweetness and it was rather dry.  Wouldn't go back... pretentious service with no value in the price."}
{"text":"Very small portions and not tasty food. The owners are VERY VERY RUDE. They make you regret you spent any money there and wasted your time. Stay happy by going to one of the many other Italian restaurants in Toronto that will welcome you and treat you right. I would never go back to this place. Support those who deserve it :)"}
{"text":"We found this restaurant by accident walking down Church St.  I agree with the previous reviewer, the atmosphere is great, nice decor, and it was relatively cozy.  The service was great, the server was friendly and attentive and made sure we had everything we needed.  I really wanted to like it, and I had a hard time deciding what to have because everything on the menu looked good.  We started with calamari, which was just ok, it was crispy, and the aioli was good, but the taste was bland and could have used more salt (or at least the herbs listed in its description on the menu).  I ordered the Pollo, Aglio, Olio e Peperoncino pizza, which had roast chicken, cherry tomatoes, roasted garlic peperoncino, basil, oregano & Parmigiano (according to the menu).  Again, I really wanted to like it, but it was terrible.  The server warned that it had a bit of spice to it, and was I ok with that.  I love spice, so I said yes.  The pizza came and it was terrible, absolutely flavourless. The chicken was dry and under-seasoned, and the only flavour it had was from the burnt grill marks (not roast like the menu indicates).  The rest of the pizza was under-seasoned as well.  There was no sauce, no spice whatsoever, the tomatoes were chopped into chunks, and I am pretty sure they were not cherry tomatoes (plus there were too many tomatoes).  I looked for but could not find or taste the roast garlic and I don't believe there was any Parmigiano on the pizza.  So overall, the pizza that arrived was nothing like indicated on the menu, and lacked all the ingredients that would have given it flavour..maybe they were there, but if they were I couldn't find or taste them.  I didn't say anything, because I had actually forgotten what exactly was supposed to be on the pizza and I assumed it was correct.  I know that many restaurants don't put salt on the table in principle, and I didn't want to ask for it but at least it may have made the pizza edible.  They were out of my husband's original choice of the seafood, so he chose the Calabri pizza.  It had sausage and peppers, and the peppers gave it a lot more flavour.  It was better than mine, although it was still a bit bland and the tomato sauce tasted like canned tomato paste.  We were hoping to find a hidden gem but we were quite disappointed.  Service is great, decor and atmosphere are great, but the food needs work."}
{"text":"The service was great, and the setting was nice and quiet. (weekday). Their portions are rather small, and compared to Grazies, just not as filling.  I would rather go for ill fornello's or Grazies if I wanted Italian food."}
{"text":"Sugo is a fairly new restaurant on Church St. It prides itself on homemade, authentic Italian food. I read a review that called this place \"casual\" and I must agree, it has a 'homemade' feel it as well.   I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, and the meal was actually pretty good. It had that homemade, comfort food feeling and was very filling. It wasn't exactly as \"life changing\" as my waiter described, but a good meal nonetheless. Besides my waiter being a bit over dramatic, he was very friendly and attentive. Any waiter that refills my water without having to be asked is a sign of a good waiter in my books (go to The Keg, Moxies or Jack Astors and you begin to appreciate this ability in the good waiters).   If you are on Church deciding beside Sugo or the neighboring 'Fuzion', I'd pick this place. I had a good dining experience, but this isn't necessarily a restaurant that will be a top pick."}
{"text":"I've been to Sugo 3 times already and I have had a great experience each time.  The patio is great, the service is excellent and the food is delicious.   The patio is a great little spot for the summer, and they've added some new summertime additions to their menu; summer berry salads and bbq burgers.  My favorite is the pasta.  Homemade, fresh ingredients.  There are very few places that serve authentic homemade pasta.  The ravioli is to die for! Their calamari is fresh, light and fluffy.  I've had 3 different servers each time I went and they were all welcoming, knowledgeable and attentive.   Another thing that great about this place is the wine list.  I find it harder and harder to find good wine in Toronto, but I have not been dissapointed at Sugo.  There Soave by the glass is a lovely pick for a sunny day on their patio. As for their portion sizes, if you want a giant plate of pasta to stuff yourself, go to east side marios.  If you want good quality food in reasonable portions go to Sugo."}
{"text":"One word for Sugo Trattoria. BLAND.   Located in the \"Village\" of Toronto as they call it, I found this place after leaving a brothel down the street full of beautiful, gorgeous women. I had 3 girls in 90 minutes, so I was a little high, comfortable, and didn't feel like walking, so I tried this place out.   When I arrived, no one was there. I sat down at a table but, was told I couldn't sit there because of bigger parties. This restaurant is a little snobby to be honest.   I ordered a coke which had too much syrup in it, and it was taken back. A new coke came out with no flavor, they must have taken the coke I sent back and filled it up with 1/2 water, in fact I know they probably did this. Sent back again and I was given an \"italian coke\" and was charged for it, naturally.   I ordered the Caprese which was actually flavorful and good, but we head South from there. And we head South fast. I ordered a margherita pizza, awful. The pizza was awful, absolutely no taste. No taste on the cheese, no taste on the sauce, no taste on the crust. I was actually thinking of dumping the pepper shaker on the pizza, I really was.  It was as if I was eating dough with water on it ...   On a sidenote, if you are a single male, stay away from here. Ones sexual preference is there right, and I have no problem with it. I was alone and men kept looking or coming up and talking to me. It's very uncomfortable, and they assume you are homosexual because you are alone. You really can't even look up. If you must come here and are straight as a board, come with any girl.  This place gets 2 stars for a great caprese ... other than that, stay away. The pizza here is awful."}
{"text":"Please save your money and dine elsewhere. I came here with a Groupon for a friend's birthday. The server was inattentive and never around. There was also only one server for many many tables. Perhaps he treated me more poorly than he normally would have because I had the Groupon but that's no excuse for bad service. I had to wait 30 minutes for my bill as our server just disappeared and went for a smoke and there was no one else around except the bartender.  The food was average at best and nothing to rave about. I was hoping for a delicious pasta and it wasn't anything I couldn't have made myself.  The real kicker was the enormous amount of flies in this restaurant.... I was swamped with fruit flies and the occasional black fly while dining. It became humourous as time went on.. I understand that a restaurant with a door open can have some flies, but really, i counted at least 10 fruit flies hovering around my head and 2 black flies.  Anyway, I won't be back and was very disappointed that I took my friend here for her birthday."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and love the attentive (and colourful) service, the homey feel of the place, and the excellent food.  A bit on the pricey side though."}
{"text":"I hate to write a bad review after one visit, but there are so many great Italian restaurants in the city that I will probably never go back to Sugo, so here it is.  First of all, the location and decor is very nice and what I might describe as \"elegantly casual\".  The service was not overly attentive but friendly enough, and efficient.  The food however, was dull.  The highlight of our meal was the crostini appetizer ($12) - three pieces of simple white bread topped with speck, apple, and brie.  Very nice.  My main (pork tenderloin) was sadly flavourless, and the orzo with tomato sauce on the side reminded me too much of a canned pasta (alphagetti-like).  I'm afraid I just didn't experience anything special here.  Our table for two facing Church Street was really nice though, and I do sincerely hope that another reviewer will try the place out and give another opinion."}
{"text":"A friend and I were checking out Sugo Trattoria's menu and ultimately decided to give it a try. Sadly the waiter was very pushy and seemed to be more interested in getting you to order more than making you feel welcome. At one point I asked about the size of one of the pizzas (my friend and I thought we would share one since we were not that hungry), and the waiter through hand gestures gave us an idea of how large it was (he made it seem small). The waiter then stated that it was good for one person. Still, I decided that we would start off with just one.  Well, the pizza was more than enough for 2 people! As we were eating the pizza we felt that it needed more cheese, so we asked for some Parmesan cheese and the waiter came back and coated the pizza with fresh Parmesan cheese. It was delicious!! Though we are not sure if the waiter covered our pizza with cheese because that is what would make us happy, or whether he was just annoyed. Nevertheless, the pizza was great and we loved that we got lots of extra cheese! I do agree with some of the reviewers about the taste. The pizza was quite bland, hence the reason we requested the extra cheese. They should have salt on their tables too since it would have helped the food taste better. But the fact that they were accommodating and that overall the pizza ended up tasting so much better, we were happy."}
