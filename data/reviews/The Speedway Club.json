{"text":"I had been meaning to come to this restaurant for the last 3 years! We came during Charlotte Restaurant Week so we were able to get a deal at $35 a person. I am not a Nascar fan but have been to the track for twice of those major race weekends. When we were there for dinner, there were not any races going on, which make getting there and leaving easier.

GETTING TO THE RESTAURANT
Park in the small lot where Bruton Smith Drive ends and crosses with Concord Parkway (route 29). We walked upstairs to the where the gift shop is. Don't go that entrance, you want walk from the parking lot under the overpass (bus drop off area) and walk in to what looks like an office lobby and find the elevator up to the restaurant.

The restaurant is super classic inside with wood paneling and it is two tiered. The window to the track is huge so you see awesome views of the racetrack. Like I said earlier, I am not a Nascar fan and this place is still worth coming to. (See picture). We sat on the 2nd tier first table and still had amazing views. It reminded me of classic restaurants in the North East and not like your average Charlotte establishment.

FOOD
The food was excellent. I had the coconut shrimp appetizer and he had the mini beef wellingtons. We both had the NY Strip steak and their cake dessert of the day. The food was presented in a very traditional way and it tasted excellent. We took a quick look at their regular menu as saw the larger version of the NY strip steak for $47, so if you want to try this place out, coming for Restaurant Week is a great deal!!"}
{"text":"This really is 1.5 stars.  1 is just mean and 2 is too much.

Wow.  There are 2 approaches you can take with Restaurant Week.
1 - Build your Business - really put a great menu together, execute it, and win people over to come back.
 2 - Feed the Masses - go cheap on menu, hire lousy temporary help for the week, put some money in the bank.

Speedway Club chose #2.

The Good:
- Beautiful setting, incredible view.  It's a very unique experience to be sitting there over the track having dinner.  Very Cool
 - The Bread Pudding was great.  A little dry but great flavor
 - Mashed potatoes were very creamy and well balanced
 - The red onion strings had great flavor and the matching sauce paired well

The Bad:
 - Our server was clueless.  Knew nothing about the food, bar offerings, could not answer one single question that arose at the table.  Really nice kid but acted like he got off the wrong floor on the elevator and was put to work.
 - Speed of service.  Very slow drinks.  Very slow first course, good timing on second course, very slow third course, checks took 45 minutes to arrive after dinner was completed
 - Wedge salad was a sliver of iceberg laid side ways on a plate and then pulled apart.  Hard to describe.  Wish I had taken a picture.
 - Culotte for a steak.  Incredibly poor choice.  Their choice for offering and mine for ordering.  When you offer a blood-rich, cross-grained steak without jaccarding (punching holes in the steak in order to tenderize), it is a terrible piece of meat.  This meat is usually used for medallions or tender tips, not as an entree on a plate.  Again, poor choice on my part for ordering but it was the only choice for steak and that's what I was in the mood for.
 
The Club really does feel like an old country club which can be really cool, but the experience felt like a really old country club about to stick a fork in it's business.

Will not eat there again, but will definitely go back for the view, sit at the bar, and hopefully get a drink."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Restaurant and Bar area of the club is very nice. I believe you need to have a club membership to go here and eat or drink. The views are outstanding you're directly above the track and can see the entire infield. I'm not a NASCAR fan but it was pretty cool to see. The food was above average as well. I took pictures of the menu to show their selection which is a basic lunch menu. I would recommend the Walnut Maple grilled salmon salad."}
{"text":"Went to the Speedway Club for 2 reasons.  One: was given a gift card    Two: to celebrate our anniversary.
I had heard nothing but great things about this restaurant.
The atmosphere was great.  Love NASCAR and overlooking the Speedway was nice.  We had a wonderful table overlooking the Charlotte Motor Speedway.  The meal I can't say the same.
My husband told the waitress he was going to order a drink with his meal.  The waitress never came back to the table to take this order.
Out of the three courses, I had to send 2 of them back.  
I do have to say that the manager did make the meal right and was very apologetic for my meal not being cooked.  The manager went out of his way to correct the meal.  
We may go to the bar and have drinks and an appetizer but not so sure about actually eating a meal at this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is definitely a meat and potatoes kind of club, no surprises, but a great wine and cocktail list. Food was good."}
{"text":"Well as a disclaimer, I'm not a huge fan of NASCAR by any means. Yeah I live in Charlotte but still very much a misplaced northerner in these regards. It's fun to go to a race, sure, but I can't really get into watching a car drive around in circles for 600 laps, especially without alcohol or watching it on TV! Yikes!

So with the Speedway Club, it's nothing personal, I just already wasn't a fan of a restaurant built inside a speedway. I probably would have never known it was even there until I was recently asked for my opinion on where the office Christmas party was to be held, and given a few choices between here and uptown, I said, jokingly of course, \"Oh the most expensive. Absolutely.\" As such, we wound up here.

Let me touch on that first. This is definitely not a place for the tight walleted. Just look at the online menu. Now again, as I didn't pay for anything myself, let's just say my rating is a little skewed. You are by far paying for the experience/ atmosphere. Simply put, if you're a fan of NASCAR and go in expecting to shell out that kind of money, I'm sure you will enjoy yourself. The food quality was very good.

Secondary to food, I had a lot of drinks while we were there. Too many drinks. Great selections of beer, wine, and liquor. Hell, they even had moonshine for all you classy rednecks. Surprisingly, most beers were modestly priced at $4.50, and most glasses of wine were $6.

Service was very good. No complaints whatsoever. 

The overall atmosphere was the ultimate pro. Very well decorated interior. Windows everywhere to look down at the track. Especially during December, you have all the Christmas lights done up for people to drive through. While we were here, there was even an outdoor movie, the Christmas Story, shown on an outdoor television. 

Definitely a good time. ...from what I remember."}
{"text":"Buffet with a view. For a Tuesday night it was ok. A few large crowds
might have surprised them. Wait staff was great keeping glasses full and plates cleared. Food was good but its not the Tuesday highlight. 

There is Tuesday night racing with kids and old guys running around for fun and sport. Saw a kid about 10 in a driving suit giving autographs. Does he print or sign? 

The Club allows you to go to the 5th floor suites and watch.  I think they bring drinks if needed. A $24 value included. 

It's a nice place. Nothing special about the buffet but no complaints. 
Desert was a hit. 
Really not a bad price if you stay till almost the end for SCHOOL BUS RACIN..yep they race them and you will laugh so hard that piece of cheesecake is going to hurt."}
{"text":"Not good! Service marginal, food was mediocre, ordered filet mignon, came overdone with salty gravy. Paid a lot for marginal meal. Server did not remove plates for 30 to 40 minutes after we were done, ridiculous."}
{"text":"We had eaten here during restaurant week last year and really enjoyed the food and service.  So when it came time to celebrate my father-in-laws 75th birthday, we thought this would be a great place.  

We had made a reservation weeks earlier for a group of twelve, but they split us into a table of 8 and a table of 4.   Even though the restaurant was basically empty, and there were several options to relocate a table or two, and put us all together.  We asked the waiter, and the hostess, and were told by both that they could not accommodate our group even though this had been reserved as a party of twelve. 

The table of 4 did not get the same level of service as the main table.   We had to ask to get our drinks and bread refilled, and no one asked how the food was.  The food was not as good as it had been during restaurant week, and my wife's salad was missing several of the items that had lead her to choose it.  

 The restaurant has been sparsely populated both times, so I'm thinking the service during restaurant week may have been the outlier.  I don't think we will try them again."}
{"text":"Came here for a work function.  Our company booked it and didn't know that we were having the buffet.  No worries I thought, it should be pretty good.   Was pretty disappointed as ALL of the main options were fried (Fish, Shrimp and Chicken).  I understand that we are in the south but at least have one option that isn't crispy.  I guess that I expected more.   

The atmosphere made up for the food as they were racing that evening.  It was great to be able to watch the cars as we ate."}
{"text":"After almost 600 reviews, this is actually the first time I find myself wanting a half a star.  The problem is that I really feel like 4 stars is too few, but five stars is too many.  4.5 would be perfect here.  Not perfect for a rating, because 5 would be perfect of course, but it would be the perfect rating for this dinner.  So it will have to get a 4 star.  They just didn't quite make it to 5 stars.  Sorry, guys.

With another restaurant week on us, we decided to browse the menus a bit and see if we can come up with something different.  Always like to try and come up with somewhere new to go.  That's when I noticed The Speedway Club.  I knew they were there, of course, but never thought about going.  In fact, I thought you had to be a member to get in (as it turns out, you do, but not during restaurant week).  As a bonus, their menu was one of the best on the list.  So we made reservations.

For an appetizer, we chose the onion rings and warm pimento cheese dip (with crackers).  These were also served with a nice selection of breads.  For perhaps the first time in my adult life, I didn't get a refill on bread.  I don't even know if they offered a refill on bread.  The appetizers were both solid offerings.  Not excellent, but quite good.

I decided on the filet mignon for dinner.  I'm usually a fan of ribeye, but the filet sounded really good.  Denise went with the salmon.   Both were good.  I found that the risotto that came with the salmon was better than the salmon itself.  It was that good.  On the steak, I was floored.  It was un-freaking-believable.

This just might be the best steak in the QC.  A small portion (6 oz), served with roasted garlic and a parmesan-crusted potato cake, it was the best piece of steak I've head in a really long time.  Maybe ever.  I just about ordered my dessert to go so I didn't ruin the taste.  I just wish that I could get into the place on a regular basis to taste that filet.

The desserts were good, but nothing compared to that steak.

Why the 4.5?  The first thing is the noise (and not from the track).  It is a really cool view, looking over the track, and being able to see what's going on is nice.  But for a nicer environment, the place can get a little loud.  So much so that it's tough to hear what the person on the other side is saying.  The desserts are good, and the appetizers are good, but not great.  The service was attentive all night, and I would like to give them more than a 4, but not quite a 5.

Sweet Tea Report: Yes, I ordered a sweet tea.  The server even told me he made it, and it was sweet.  Unfortunately, it wasn't.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't very sweet.  So I'd probably suggest passing unless you like just average tea.  I didn't figure this into the rating, as the tea is drinkable, but it's just not that sweet."}
{"text":"The best place for all you can eat crab legs and prime rib. The service is great and the food is spectacular. A must visit."}
