{"text":"I've had many a lunch meal from this place during my high school years. Nothing has ever been really notable to me from it. Their burger is your typical cooked from frozen to charred affair. The poutine is made with shredded cheese (thank god they don't commit the further heinous crime of adding cheddar) and the gravy tastes like the generic storebought kind. They do however have a \"greek poutine\" consisting of feta and oil drizzled onto fries with a small container of tzatziki that's interesting to try. Their pizza isn't memorable whatsoever.

All in all, the predictable quality you expect from these sorts of places. To be fair, I haven't really ever tried any of their more greek items on their menu. Due to its close proximity to where I live however, I find myself stopping by every so often and always come away thinking \"how did I ever think this tasted good?\" I suppose I'm just another victim to the rose tinted lenses of nostalgia."}
{"text":"Excellent gyros, wings & slices. It'll surprise you with thier wide array of choices covering b-fast/lunch & dinner. Pretty much a standard diner like menu but without the grease hangover.
Huge bonus in that they deliver on those febuary evenings you don't feel like cooking or venturing out."}
{"text":"Diamond Corner is a pillar in the Pantheon of East York. It is held with high standards amongst all, and never fails to please. I live very close to the restaurant and frequent it often. To begin, they're greek poutine is a perfect twist and mix of Canadian and greek cuisine, and tops they're already outstanding regular poutine. Another classic are they're salads. They are a bit expensive, but they are worth every penny as the ingredients are always fresh and the sauces are always mouth watering. The pizza is great too. If your looking for slices diamond corner is perfect, as they offer thick, large slices which remind me of my childhood days in New York. Finally, they're souvlaki dinners are amongst the best in East York and Greek town. Again they are a bit expensive but it's completely worth it. Overall I would recommend Diamond Corner to everyone and can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"It's exactly what you think it will be when you walk up.   

It's a take out grill.   Decent.  Cheap.  Not good for you.  

Definitely fits a certain need.    Delivery cheeseburgers.  Souvlaki and pizza.  Something for everyone.  And milkshakes.   

It ain't fine dining but after a disaster at nearby firkin, I got the burger I craved here.   Good enough."}
{"text":"I'll give this a 5 because I feel like other people are being a bit harsh. Most of the food is good, don't go near the mozzarella sticks or the pierogies or so help you God. I feel like DC is an exclusive club, the are kind of like the soup nazis from Seinfeld, they are rude until you get to know them and once your good with them... Youre in! But getting friendly with the older guy is impossible, so don't attempt it because it's not happening. The pizza is good as long as they actually listen to your order. There chicken souvlaki dinners are your basic Greek dinners. It's great if your in the area but it's not something I'd travel for. A bit of a scrub up would not go a miss either. But hey I like this place I've been going here since Highschool and I'm accustomed to it."}
{"text":"Pizza is over-priced for the neighbourhood (four other pizza shops within two blocks, three of them cheaper). The food tastes fine. I like that they have mozza sticks. They aren't the large tasty sticks I prefer but they do in a pinch. The interior looks like it could use a good cleaning, too, but it isn't offensive enough to put me totally off of the place. It's the closest pizza/fried food store to my house so I'll keep going back for my morning-after sticks and onion rings, but I'll probably keep going down the road for pizza."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place for dinner one night when I was in a hurry and didn't have time to make dinner. So I decided to try it out. I ordered a combo meal which has 2 burgers, 2 sides (fries or onion rings) and 2 canned drinks. (I'm sorry I don't remember the exact price because I've only been there once) but it was around $22. I also ordered chicken fingers without the side  (which is almost $12 with the side-a bit pricey but you get 5 chicken strips). They charged me $8 without the side. So in total it was around $30 plus tax for 3 people to eat. 
The food was ok, not horrible but nothing to write home about. 2 sides was enough for 3 if you don't want too much. We had both the fries and onion rings. I preferred the onion rings.  They seem to have a lot of business at lunchtime as they are across from a high school so keep that in mind if your wanting to eat lunch there."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service and even worse food.  Forgot a meal from a takeout order and when I returned they said they'd forgot and didn't even offer an apology."}
