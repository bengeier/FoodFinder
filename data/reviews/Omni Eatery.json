{"text":"Came in super hungry and decided to try some bibimbap. I LOVE Korean food and was a little sceptical but my hunger got the best of me. It was actually SO good! The spicy sauce was delicious and I loved that they had salad in there too. Most places don't include that but I find it really makes it nice and fresh. Price was 6.99 + 1.00 for protein (I got tofu).  The tarts and pastries looked great too, I'll try those next time. The lady working was wonderful, really friendly and happy. Always great when the service is awesome. Recommended!"}
{"text":"This local breakfast place has changed owners a couple times over the last few years, and the current owners have brought in tasty, cheap, cheerful and healthy homemade Chinese/Korean lunches, better breakfast options and a myriad of delicious little baked goods alongside the longstanding \"many kinds of coffee\" tradition.   I come here often for a quick lunch or breakfast on the way to work, and it's always a welcome respite from chain restaurant takeaway breakfast sandwiches.  Try the Bi Bim Bap, homemade soups, special glass noodles and, of course, the cookies!"}
{"text":"Omni is a small restaurant with two tables and two benches along its windows. They have daily specials and a homemade-food vibe. I ordered the shepherd's pie and to be honest, it looked and tasted like it came straight from Costco, but the portion was big.   They also have baked items, coffees, bagels, and to add to the homemade vibe, their menus and signage are just all over the place and a little overwhelming to read all at once.   While there was a steady stream of people at lunch, it never felt busy or crowded, which made for a really comfortable, homey experience.   The place is definitely not worth a special trip, but if you're in the area, it's not a bad spot to visit for a bite."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a coffee and some croissants. The coffee was nothing special but the croissants passed muster. Will return on future Saturday/Sunday mornings, I suspect.   They also offer all day breakfast and sandwiches but with so many other options around for this type of food I suspect I won't be venturing there. I'll be sticking to this place for the bakery items."}
{"text":"The lady is super friendly and likeable. Will definitely visit the store again. Oh my sister tried their mango lassi, she loved it!"}
{"text":"I had a business meeting downtown this morning --- and was ravenous afterwards.  Ventured back to the subway and passed this place on Wellesley.  Oh  My  God.  What is happening these days?  When I least expect it, a WONDERFUL SURPRISE AWAITS!  (Would be nice if life was always like this).  They have Korean food to go as well as the usual bagels, muffins, etc.  Tried the cold bibimbap today with beef and the fried egg, with the freshest vegetables imaginable.  So-gogi (beef) was not too sweet which was a huge plus for me.  I chatted with the owner's son for a while - nice people who own and run this place.  SPOTLESSLY CLEAN!  OMG, sustaining lunch, healthy choice, reasonably priced and ... what made this TRULY special for me ... THEY USE REAL GOCHU-CHANG!!!!  If I am ever in the area again ... I will definitely go back.  Thank you - GOMAPSUMNIDAH!!!  Five stars imnidah!!!"}
