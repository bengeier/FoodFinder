{"text":"This place really is gross. I've seen with my own eyes rats come out their stove and go back in, like they're playing! And the woman there is standing by the window with her whole hand in her mouth. Complete disregard for cleanliness."}
{"text":"This place is gross. It's like a health and food inspector's nightmare. The pizza looks like it was baked five years ago and made of melted plastic, which prompted us to try the biryani, which looked a bit better.

Fast-forward eight hours later, and we both have severe food poisoning. 

Also while we were there they refused to make change for this girl, and I'm pretty sure it was just cuz she was black."}
{"text":"J Pizza Plus is the cheapest pizza in the city by far, and it is totally edible. I kind of want to stop my review there, because it about sums it up, but I'll go into more detail.

It is run by a Muslim family, so there are no pork products, meaning their pepperoni is not pepperoni, so I go for their veggie slice. Their slices are sometimes dried up, but they are $2. Who doesn't love a bargain? When ordering a full pizza (MASSIVE party pizza for $24 with, like, ALL of the topics) I recommend getting extra cheese. Extra cheese solves most food problems, after all. 

I also like their samosas and curried chicken, but stay away from their poutine. I love all poutine, even bad poutine. It is just SO bad. 

PEPPER POINT: They used to put up Pizza Pizza ads in their windows and cut off the part that said Pizza Pizza and just use their exact walk-in specials. Funny shit."}
