{"text":"love their fried rice. crave their chicken and broccoli. steamed dumplings are awesome. only problem is that I'm less than a half mile away and it takes 45 minutes for delivery. I order when I'm not hungry so I will be when it gets here. yum!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has changed management and has a new name. Delivery minimum went up and now there is a fee for delivery. Much of the food has changed recipes. Most everything I've ordered has still been fine, some things better, other things not. Portions definitely seem smaller."}
{"text":"Extremely bland Chinese take out.  Everything was fresh, just no flavor.  I had chicken with black bean sauce.  Normally a very salty dish.  I had to add lots of soy sauce, sesame oil, chili oil.  I was trying anything to get some flavor!  Rice was low quality, didn't have flavor.  They used part of the outer peel of the onion which should have been discarded.  It was too tough to chew.  Eew!  Low cost, and close.  I would try them again but not unless I needed something cheap and nearby!  Yet another disappointing ethnic restaurant experience in Pittsburgh."}
