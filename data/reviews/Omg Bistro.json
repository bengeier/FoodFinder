{"text":"Great place for a quick tasty lunch! The pizza there is phenomenal. They also do catering in the back and had them make me a lasagna to bring home which everyone enjoyed."}
{"text":"A cute little bistro with sandwiches and pastas. 
Great if, by some chance, you find yourself in the neighbourhood and are hangry.
I just wish they had some fruit or anything on the lighter scale of things.
But what we did eat was tasty.
What we noshed: Steak sandwich, croissant, salmon sandwich."}
{"text":"The interior of the cafe was ok. I think the food could use extra flavor. The panini I had ordered was rather bland. However the bisque was nice."}
