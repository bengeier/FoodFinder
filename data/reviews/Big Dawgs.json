{"text":"I got a Chicago Dog at this place. While not the best Chicago-style hot dog I've ever had, it was definitely above par for concession food. I paid $9 for the hot dog which seemed high until I saw how gigantic it was.

Next time I'm at Chase Field, I'm sure I'll hit up this place again."}
{"text":"***Chase Field's Big Dawgs sells decent though expensive foot-long hot dogs that are heavily topped and categorized by city or state (Chicago Dog, Wisconsin Dog, California Dog, Arizona Dog)***

Chase Field's main concession stand is Double Headers, which is easy to find because of their many locations.  Double Headers features traditional ballpark food like hot dogs, popcorn and nachos.  Big Dawgs (which has only one location in Section 130) also serves traditional concessions like hot dogs, but they are done with a little more flair.

Big Dawgs emphasizes \"big\" food items such as a variety of foot-long hot dogs to a very large $16 soft pretzel that comes with multiple dipping sauces.

The foot-long hot dogs are named by city/state and they were offering 4 varieties on our visit (the dogs were displayed in a glass case with all their toppings).  There was the Arizona Dog, which featured melted cheese, sausage and red and black tortilla strips.  There was also a Chicago Dog, which seemed to the traditional Chicago ingredients like relish, tomato, etc.  They also had a Wisconsin Dog, which was topped with macaroni and cheese and bacon.

There was even a California Dog on the menu.  If I asked Californians what they think would be in the California Dog, I imagine most would say avocado.  I don't think avocado was in it (unless the enthusiastic cashier did not explain it correctly). The California Dog was topped with melted cheese, onions, peppers, and steak (it really seemed to be a Philly Cheesesteak Dog so maybe the name was just incorrect).

We went with the Arizona Dog and it was pretty good.  The bun was nice and soft while the hot dog had a good flavor.  Not too strong and not bland.  The toppings were just okay.  The tortilla strips were fine and provided a good crunch, but the cheese did not have much spice and the sausage was a little ordinary.

The staff here was very enthusiastic and helpful.

Pricing was high.  The foot-long dogs were elaborate creations, but they might not be worth the $9 price tag.

Big Dawgs provides a different hot dog experience so it might be worth checking out if you come to this stadium and want to walk away with something a little more interesting than a regular hot dog, nachos or popcorn."}
{"text":"Went to grab some food from here yesterday during the Dodgers VS Diamondbacks game. Let me tell you, worst freaking place ever! Not only did the old blonde lady at the register walk off mid order 3 times, by the fourth time she didn't even tell anyone that we was straight up leaving the register for good! There were still people behind me!! But she did come back to tell me she didn't need my name because the black lady who was running expo knew it was my order. 
I stood there for 10 minutes waiting for my snake bite hot dog, trying to get the black lady's attention that my hot dog has been ready , sitting there, she just RANDOMLY walks out too!!!  Wow! I was so fed up after waiting 15 minutes for a freaking hot dog I  went to a different register and ask the lady if she could just give me my damn hot dog. She asked me for my name, of course, and I had to explain to her the blonde old lady told me I didn't need it because the black lady knew it'd be mine but BOTH of them were GONE! She gave me my hot dog and apologized and I told her it's not her fault and she's the only decent person that worked there. By the time I got back to my seat, of course my foot long  hot dog was COLD. 

Save your $11 dollars and go to any other stand."}
{"text":"Come to the park and looking for a good hot dog? Come here and order The Brewski. At $9.50 per dog one can think this place is over priced but then again what isn't overpriced at a baseball park?

The hot dogs here are good & compared to other baseball concession stands these are delicious dogs. Just like other palaces get here early or expect to have a 10+ minute wait."}
{"text":"Still serving dogs but just down from the original location.

Good that they are creative and always come up with new items each year, but really don't just hit the mark.

We got the cheese burger dog for $11, go for the brats, that way you can't lose.

Everytime I have been to there the bun has been hard as a rock."}
