{"text":"Absolutely wonderful food.  Fresh out of the oven BBQ pizza was divine.  Tried their cheese burger, wing dings and mixed Philly. Everything was beyond par. The chef himself was courteous. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas, and I've had my fair share of burgers. Today was my first time here, and I tried the bacon cheeseburger. It was perfection. Everything you expect from a classic cheeseburger. All the ingredients seemed fresh and the patty was perfectly cooked. The fries are also perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside not too oily with just the right amount of seasoning.  I'll definitely be coming back to explore the menu."}
{"text":"Don't be alarmed by surrounding area.  The food is quite excellent. Both burgers we got were amazing."}
{"text":"On vacation from Nebraska and found this place on Yelp; it's the kind of place you might just drive by if you're not a local, but it is well worth the stop! I was with my family so we tried a little of everything.. bacon cheeseburger, Philly, calzone and corned beef.. it was all excellent! Everything was reasonably priced and came with fries that were also fantastic!"}
{"text":"I order the meat lovers pizza. The crust was good, not too chewy or dry. I love being able to have meat on my pizza. I felt that the sauce could have been more easily distributed as well as the cheese. The family loved it. I will be back."}

{"text":"Doesn't honor the yelp coupon. Wings were well priced and tasted great and fresh. Half of the menu items not in stock. Won't return again and I suggest the owner acknowledge the yelp coupon or take it down."}
{"text":"Good food and great service! This is a great place to come to late night. The cashier will engage you in conversation... Genuine conversation. Very social and comfortable,  will come back again!"}
{"text":"No frills, and really good food. Small like a carry out, but we ate at the table. Had the fried perch sandwich with fries. Hot and crispy with all the fixin's. Good bun. Fries were perfect.  The Hawaiian hamburger with a pineapple slice and sweet sauce was grilled to perfection. The fried chicken wings were big and tender. So delicious. Son ordered 15, and said 10 would have been enough, they were so meaty. Lot of sauces to try. Even the fried mushrooms were very good. A few customers came in for carry outs. Drinks are from the glass cooler. Ketchup and mayo come as tear packs. Would have liked a bottle of ketchup for those yummy fries. Prices are totally reasonable. No frills. Nice counter service.  Been here twice now. Will return again."}
