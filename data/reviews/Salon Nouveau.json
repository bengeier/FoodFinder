{"text":"This place was the worst salon I have ever been to! I was not happy with my hair and the owner made the girl do it again, without helping her. After another 2 hours my hair looked worse than it did the first time. The owner basically told me i was wrong and laughed at me. She would not give me my money back and she wouldnt fix my hair herself! So basically i left pissed with bad color. I would never even look in the direction of that place."}
{"text":"I was very excited about getting first my  facial in ages.   Salon was convenient to my home and the aesthetician Katie was friendly and energetic.  Treatment room was comfy and everything was fine until Katie applied the masque.  My skin started burning.  Katie immediately washed off the mask and ended the treatment.  She said that my occasional use
 of Retin-A in the past made my skin too sensitive for the facial.  She knew that ahead of time, and shouldn't have used it.  So I had a 25min treatment instead of the 60min treatment I paid for.  On the way out, I was pressured to come back for hair and nail treatments.  I wouldn't go back if it was free."}
{"text":"The salon looks clean and well maintained. Mallory styled my hair and did an amazing job. She was very professional and gave great ideas for color and cuts. It was my first time at the salon but it won't be my last."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon for a Gel Mani & Pedicure and was treated poorly.  I contacted the salon multiple times, and my service was canceled twice after making confirmed appointments. The owner explained that Groupon devalues their salon and its standards and that her providers lose money. I was disappointed by the poor guest service and attitude of the Owner Vanessa."}
{"text":"I've been going to this salon ever since they opened. I love the girls that work there! Vanessa and Bri are so experienced and can do anything you ask them to do! Not only are they good at what they do but they are passionate about it as well making it that much better! I would never let anyone else touch my hair ever since I started going to Bri! Definitely recommend this salon for the best care for your hair!! Nice location right before Anthem. I have also learned so much about what products are good or bad for your hair, and definitely see a difference in my hairs health and growth! 5 stars no doubt!!!"}
{"text":"I almost feel bad leaving this review, because they have so many bad reviews already.  However, they need to wake up and make some changes.  I can not believe this place is in business with how rude and unprofessional they are.  I have had two experiences there.  I went and had a brazilian blowout with the owner about three years ago.  Her personality is so beyond rude that I actually think there is something wrong with her.  It was impossible to talk to her and she was just rude whenever she did speak.  The only time she was remotely pleasant was at the end, maybe to get me to give a good tip or something and to try to sell me a bunch of products.  It was like jekyl and hyde.  I decided that I would not be going back there.  Recently, my husband bought me a gel manicure/pedicure groupon, and it happened to be for this salon.  I thought at least the nail technician probably won't be the rude owner again.  But I didn't even get that far.  I called to book an appointment, and the front desk person was so obnoxious and rude that I am going to have my husband get a refund on this groupon.  The minute I said I would like to book an appointment to use this groupon, she barked that she could get me in a week from today.  However, that date doesn't work for me.  I need a Saturday appointment unless I pay a babysitter during the week.  I explained that, and asked for this Saturday.  They are booked, understandably.  I asked for the next Saturday.  Also booked.  I asked when is the next Saturday appointment?  She said they only book out two weeks in advance, so I can't get a Saturday appointment right now.  Really?  So a person can't make a nail appointment further out than two weeks?  I doubt that.  I bet it was just because I had a groupon.  Sad, because I often get pedicures and gel nails and this is very close to my new home.  I will never call them or go there again.  Every other business I've given a bad review to has since closed.  I won't be surprised if this one does the same."}
{"text":"This is the best salon I've ever been to. I'm not even sure about the haircuts, but what I love the most about this place is the other customers. Anytime I'm there I can count on seeing at least one customer call the Henderson police, or get the police called on them. Personally, I call the police every time I go because my hair looks so good it should be illegal! Oh and FYI, if Vanessa wasn't my friend and longtime stylist I would totally ask for Chloe because she is smoking hot and has great cans ;)"}
{"text":"Sloppy work, the side edge of my big toenail was completely missed, and there are little \"slivers\" all over of pieces of nail not completely trimmed/filed off.  Didn't lotion/massage my hands at all, and the foot massage was REALLY short.  The tub wasn't filled with water when she had me sit down which is unusual.  There's a bench seat that ends up being a bit uncomfortable to sit on...it's at a weird angle, too high.  
I just left and am already planning to squeeze another appointment in somewhere else super soon before I go on my vacation.  I don't want janky looking nails.   I will never return, it was a waste of time and $$$$."}
{"text":"I had the Groupon for a gel manicure and spa pedicure. I booked an appointment easily, so that was a plus. The girl that did my mani/pedi was nice, but was forcing conversation to the point that it was super awkward, asking me about my favorite color, my favorite animal, etc. 

She was definitely a hair stylist, not a nail tech. She struggled to file my nails, barely did anything to my cuticles and the massage was super short. The polish application was uneven and unprofessional with quite a bit of polish on my skin which she said was fine because \"it would wash off later.\" I could have done way better myself. 

Also, they apparently ran out of the pedicure sandals, so she told me I would have to walk barefoot across the salon to the manicure station. The regular polish choices were not salon brands, many were \"NYC\" or \"Sinful Colors\" from the drugstore. They had limited gel polish colors, which she explained to me was because one of their employees had stolen some of them...oh ok? Overall, not a good experience and I will definitely not be returning. Not worth the money at all for a mani/pedi, even at the Groupon price."}
{"text":"Had a manicure and pedicure and - even with the Groupon discounted price - I didn't think it was worth it.

The manicurist was quite pleasant and friendly - the conversation was probably the best part of the experience - but I just didn't think the quality of the work was anything special."}
{"text":"Customer Service is awful.  Vanessa is incompetent and doesn't care to book new clients.  She thinks she own the business."}
{"text":"I booked an appt for 3 people (two adults one child). They only have 2 pedicure chairs. So, we all had to go at different times because one was already pre occupied. I bought a groupon for a 1 hour hydrotherapy pedicure & massage. My whole pedicure took 20mins or less. She only did one coat of paint and the paint job was mediocre. No massage. My friend's pedicure on the other hand took over an hour and they didn't use any product. Paint job was bad and the water was cold. Neither one of us left feeling it was money well spent. The ladies were pleasant."}
{"text":"I tried this place for a haircut with a Groupon Now deal ($25 for a wash, haircut, and blow dry).  I am always nervous when trying out new hair stylists, but Lindsay did a great job.  The head massage alone was worth a return visit but I'm also happy with my hair cut.  I will likely go back but not if a regular hair cut costs $50..."}
{"text":"So far, I haven't been able to get an appointment.  People keep calling me to schedule an appt., but it's for right at the time they're calling (stupid).  When I try to call them, it goes to voicemail.  Someone called me again today & wanted to set up an appt for today.  When I told her that today wouldn't work, she couldn't offer any more days.  Instead, I have to go through the whole \"She'll have to call you back to schedule an appt\" thing again.  This is a pain in the ass.  Just who is \"she\"? I asked if there was only one person who does the manicures/pedicures.  I was told no, but that they don't have the staff's schedule.  So why the hell do you keep calling me??? How about this: get the schedule of the manicurists and then call me, so that we don't have to play these nonsense games.  What a novel concept!  Think I'm just going to trash this Groupon :-/"}
{"text":"I came here to use a Living Social deal for a Manicure and Pedicure. The two people who did my manicure and pedicure were very nice and friendly, despite the conversations feeling forced. The salon is clean and I really liked how the pedicure spa station was set up (a comfortable bench filled with dozens of pillows). Unfortunately, compared to other places, this is what I didn't like:

-No base coat was used on either my hand or toenails.
-An actual nail tech did not do my pedicure. She is a hair stylist and this definitely showed when she didn't use anything to separate my toes, so a few of my toes were messed up before the top coat was even applied
-...AND she only put 1 coat of polish
-The entire appointment felt rushed.
-It was unnecessarily difficult to get an appointment. Just to book a mani-pedi, the receptionist advised me to call at least 2 days in advance. When I did call, it went to voicemail and I left a message specifically asking for Friday (3 days advance). I did not get a call back until the next day and when I did call back, they said they couldn't fit me in. I had to bring up the fact that someone from the salon called and left me a message to finalize a time for Friday. Only after that did they schedule me.

I would be really upset if I had to pay the original price ($60) for the experience that I got. A salon like this, one that touts itself as a classy salon, should not have service like this. I've had better mani-pedis at  hole-in-the-wall places and for less than half their price.

I'm not sure if this experience is due to the fact that I was a coupon client. If it is, then that's a damn shame. If it wasn't, then DEFINITELY do NOT go here. There are tons of other places in town that you can go to get a good manicure and pedicure for a good price."}
{"text":"Idk why everyone is saying the manager is rude and stuck up... she's trying to run a business and you Groupon hoes are trying to ruin the poor thing. She's so nice. This salon always has high end products in stock. There's no drama here. Everyone is knowledgeable and experienced. It's clean and professional. They do everything here from mani-pedis, hair cut/color, and even facials. 
Goldie is the stylist that did my hair. She cut and colored my hair from dark brown/black to that new new silver.  I can't wait to show it off! 
The only drawback is the location.  It's behind a restaurant but it's not that hard to find. Other than that... I love it here and I will continue to come here and reference this salon as well as Goldie."}
{"text":"I had a few bloody cuticles waking out of there, not for me. The atmosphere is nice and all but I think some more experience would not hurt."}
{"text":"I completely agree with the other reviews about this salon, they were HORRIBLE. I was given the Groupon for the Gel Manicure and Spa Pedicure and I was excited to try a new place. The process of trying to book an appointment is impossible. They don't answer the phone and they are booked for weeks in advance. The day of my appointment I had walked in and there was no one to be seen. I started to walk around and I eventually found someone and asked if I was supposed to sign in. She responds, \"I'll be right there\". I walked back to the front and she came up to help me. When she asked for my groupon she was very demanding. I was a little uneasy at this point. She asked if I had gels already on my nails and I told her there was barely anything left on my nails but I did have them on my toes. Her response, \" Wow...awesome...\". I was skeptical with evening going through with the appointment now. She told me to go find a color, so I did so. She set up the pedicure spa for me and I sat down. The technician had stepped away for a moment and out of the blue some other lady came over to me. No greeting or nothing, she goes on to tell me how it's my fault that I did not inform them that I had gels on my nails to begin with. She continued on saying that now, \"this is going to take a longer to do since they have to wait for my gels to come off and that the technician is now going to lose her next client and won't be getting paid...and that they are also charging me a removal fee for the gels that will now cost me $20\". She is yelling and arguing with me about how I am \"inconveniencing\" them terribly. I told her it was not my fault that they were unable to follow through on their end and find out the information they need to know in order to book appointments accordingly. At this point I was furious and did not want any service done.

To top off this \"great\" experience, this mani and pedi took 3.5 HOURS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

On my way out I had tipped the technician on my own. The rude lady had rung me up for the difference that I owed and asked, \" are you leaving a tip on here or what?\" I told her politely that I already gave it to her and she says, \" okay good\". 

This was THE worst experience ever. Customer service should be taken seriously because you cannot run a business if you do not know how to talk to be nicely. I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone ever. It was the biggest waste of time and money and I wish for no one to ever go through that."}
{"text":"not a good experience still trying to get refund never got service i prepaid for was traveling and they made me appt then didn't have time owner said refund then said not their issure to refund"}
{"text":"Manicurist was a great person..but her quality of work wasn't what I expected. Conversation was the best part of the visit. Chipped nails within a week, she didn't even do a manicure before applying gel polish. Owner of the place seemed to be very stuck up!! I called in advance to schedule an appt for my mother in law & I, when we got there, she tried to say I only made an Appt for 1.

 I would NOT RECOMMEND Any one to come here!! 
I hope the manicurist can relocate!!"}
{"text":"spa prices without spa service

I came in for a gel manicure/pedicure. The nail technician i had was super nice and we were able to keep conversation going the whole time. Unfortunately the 2 hour appointment wasn't long enough so she had to rush to finish my pedicure. Because of her rushing my toenail polish was not dry 24 hours later when i had to put sneakers on. The corners of my big toes got super messed up because the lower layers of nail polish were not dry. I called and the manager let me come back in to get in fixed. I did not know what color was on my nails but the owner/manager assured me that she would find the perfect match. i tried to tell her that i could just pick another color to make it easier but she didn't want to spend that much time fixing my nails and would rather just paint my big toenails. i said fine, thinking that she would find the right shade. The lighting in there must be awful because I let nails dry and noticed that my big toes were a cool coral while the rest of my toenails were barbie pink!! definitely does not match, does not look good in the sunlight. i'm very disappointed and i don't have hours to sit in their salon to get it fixed. i paid more than what i usually pay to get my nails done here thinking it would be a more luxurious experience since it was considered a spa but that could not be further from the truth. does not even have a spa like atmosphere inside.... just want you to pay more for crappy service. would not recommend going her. should have looked on yelp."}
{"text":"Got my hair done, Best color EVER!  put 3 different colors in my hair, I couldn't be happier! 

Clean, fun, professional with a brand new staff! I'd give this place another try."}
{"text":"Went there to get color, Vanessa the owner and \"so called stylist\" quoted me $55-65 for a color.  She had me there from 1-3:30 for just a color.  She was taking people while doing my hair, she even stopped and did an interview for hiring someone while I was sitting there.  She kept asking other girls in the salon to wash my hair, comb my hair, blowdry my hair and was doing other peoples cuts and colors while doing mine.  I felt like a petting zoo.  After all that my hair was noticeably a pink color throughout and bright pink in the front.  I asked for a mahogany color.  I told her I did not like it and it was uneven colored and she told me to just wash it 10 times to get color right, she even tried to send me home with some brown color to do myself, isnt that what I paid her for?? When I went to pay she charged me $165.00 for just a color!!!!  She said it was because she had to use more color on me, I have been coloring my hair for 20 years and have never been charged more than $135 for a cut AND color...let alone just a color!!  She told me to call her and she would fix if I still didnt like, I called her next day because after washing my hair 4x in shower it accually got brighter and she told me she would fix but would charge me again!!  Are you kidding me??  Terrible!!!!!"}
{"text":"New to Henderson and got so Lucky choosing this salon. I have hair extensions and when I moved to town I desperately needed them redone.  Vanessa was quick to get me in, fix the poor work the stylist before her did on my extensions (at a different salon), and did an amazing color and cut! My hair was so matted from being behind on my appt and not being told how to properly take care of my extensions. She got through all the mats with minimal damage. She did an amazing job. 3 weeks later I haven't lost one extension and they look and feel great. Heather waxed my eyebrows better than I have had in years! I got exactly what I asked for in a waxing. Last Tiffany rocked at my nails! Perfect length, the design I wanted exactly, and again 3 weeks later still haven't lost or broke one. Thanks ladies!!!"}
{"text":"Love this salon! Bri does such an amazing job with making sure my hair is healthy & isnt dead. Everyone at the salon is nice & friendly. Worth going to!"}
{"text":"I used a Groupon for a mani-pedi.  My manicurist was Natasha.  Nice girl.  Terrible manicurist. In fact, she made my feet bleed.  I've been putting on band aids for a week. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Worst ever..minimal foot massage, no calf massage, failed to clean under toenails.  Moving on to the manicure, brought over a bowl of water and never soaked my nails in, no lotion which means no hand or arm massage.  I could go on...."}
{"text":"Horrible place and service in many ways.............dirty, dirty, dusty all over the place.  The ceiling fans were so thick with dirt that it was like looking at a cob web all over.  The dust would set off an allergy attack in a healthy person!  I had purchased a Living/Social pkg for a gel nail mani/pedicure.  It took over 5 days for them to schedule. The nail tech was very pleasant, but the best part was the pedicure, however, she had no clue about gel nails and soaked mine off and attempted to apply new ones with color gel polish. It looked as if a 5 year old did the nails. I went back the next day, asked for the manager and also called her 2 times, but no return calls, when I went back, the nail tech was not in and I should another person there my nails. She was a dizzy rude chick with ugly blonde hair who had no finesse about anything, not to mention customer service. This place should be closed down by the Health District due to the filthy dirt/dust and to the improper sanitation  as evidenced by the old dirty looking foot wash machines.  It should be reported to the Better Business Bureau for their poor customer service."}
{"text":"I wish I can give a negative rating.  The WORSE service ever!  I was there for two hours for a terrible job with so call man/pedi that a five year old can do a better job!  Mani is nothing but a nail paint.  She didn't soak my hand, cut cuticles or even lotion my hand.  There're more nail polish on my fingers than on my finger nails same with my toes.  I had to walk her through the process.  At one point, I filed my own nails.  The lady was slower than snail.  I'm so angry right now!  If I was the owner I would be embarrassed!  How do you allow such horrible service?  How do you stay in business?  Are you paying attention to these reviews?  Ladies, please save your precious time and monies, DON'T GO THERE!!!!!"}
{"text":"So let me just start by saying, don't let the two star review scare you. I've been seeing Melissa here for the past year. This salon is clean, all the staff are very friendly and welcoming, I feel like part of the family, which is rare! The stylists are top notch and will give you a great experience! Give them a chance! I promise you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Mary is THE BEST for nails! She's so sweet, does an excellent job, and uses a really great hard gel technique. I drove all the way from Summerlin to see her, and I will definitely be making the trek every time I need them done!"}
{"text":"The worst!!! I left my pedi with a bleeding heel.  I requested a refund but even with photo proof, my name in the appt book AND a receipt the owner wanted to investigate if I was ever in the salon at all!  She wrote me a ranting note about her surveillance cameras but refused the refund.  I also noticed too late that instruments DID NOT come out of clean pack or any sanitizing liquid at all."}
{"text":"This salon is the best I have ever been to. The nasty reviews are not accurate. I have been pleased with nothing other than professionalism and great work. I hated my toes and never wore open toed shoes before coming here. I had ingrown toenails and within my first month they were better. I have never in my life gotten a full set and kept them on until I came here. I have had mine on for 3 months now chips lifts or cracks. I would recommend this salon to anyone looking for quality and their flexible hours and personalized service is top notch."}
{"text":"Heather's facial is amazing! The results were instant and obvious. She's highly trained, and reasonably priced. Do yourself a favor, and treat yourself to an anti-aging facial or body treatment!"}
{"text":"Like everyone who posted above me, I too feel that I was jipped by the Livingsocial/Groupon deal I bought for a Gel Manicure and Spa pedicure. First of all it took me over a week of calling every day to reach someone to make an appointment. Second, they have a 24 hr cancellation policy (as if they are an important doctor's office), and after I had an emergency and missed my appointment, they failed to re-schedule me and refund my money. Livingsocial took their side and it was a bad call for me. I should have read all these reviews before I even bought that bullshiz deal."}
{"text":"I have been seeing Vanessa for about a year now.  My first visit was last year for my birthday at which time I got a Brazilian  blowout, facial, mani-pedi and wax.  I had a great experience with all my services and returned a few months later.

Although everyone at the salon has done a great job, I want to talk about Vanessa.  I went to her for the Brazilian blowout 3 times now.  Every time she is very conscious of the fact that my hair is very curly and course( I'm African-American) and is skilled enough to manage my hair.  First, she is very knowledgable and is able to answer all my questions and explains what she is doing and what needs to be done.  She not only makes my hair look great but explains what I need to do to maintain my hair. To top it all of she is not only the best but she does the blowout for cheaper than any other place I have gone.

I think Vanessa does a great job and is always very nice and even though it was a long time since I had been in( we moved across town) she still remembered me and did a great job again today!"}
{"text":"We booked a mani-pedi for two and the ladies there were very confused.  They had no idea what they were doing.  We paid for a \"hot lotion\" mani-pedi with the groupon and they told us they weren't going to give us one because \"it was hot outside\".  They did an absolutely terrible job on our nails too.  The employees are rude and unfriendly.  Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"we went to salon nouveau because someone i knew said he worked there.   when i called ,  they said he did not work there.    i asked if they were sure,  it seemed as if all of a sudden,  she remembered,  that he did work there siometimes,  to do extensions or something.  when i was in town i called each day,   he was never there.    i dont know why a business would lie,  saying someone worked there,   that clearly does not.    we have tried to reach him several times in june,   we were not able to find him there.   it was disappointing,  and we never went back."}
{"text":"Bought a $39 groupon for a 60 minute custom facial which was originally priced at $80. I didn't have a problem booking an appt, which was a bonus. 

Katie was my esthetician, she was very nice from the beginning, made me feel welcome. Immediately after starting the facial she started talking about the products, which I don't mind hearing about products, but I like to relax during pampering, I don't like feeling pressured to buy. Then she started talking about add ons to the facial,  one I was surprised wasn't included in the facial, she charged $10 extra for extractions, which I agreed to because that's my favorite part of a facial. Well she did my extractions with her fingers, which I was kinda surprised again, always been taught not to do that with your fingers but with a tool. Definitely not worth the extra $10. Then I agreed to another add on, $25 for a pumpkin enzyme peel, again kinda not sure why I agreed to it, didn't really seem like it was anything special. So I spent an extra $35 for this facial, wasn't anything I'd go back for again."}

{"text":"I tried this place with a Groupon Now deal. I'm not sure if my experience with the front desk was because it was a crazy-Groupon day or what but the front desk here needs a little help. I called several times trying to get an appointment only to be sent straight to voicemail every time. I was trying to plan my day so I really wanted to talk to someone to find out when I could come by. I left 2 voicemails over the course of the day and never heard back so I finally just went in around 2. When I showed up, no one was at the front desk so I stood there awkwardly for a few minutes until a girl (who appeared to be just sitting down hanging out) got up and 'welcomed' me, went and got the owner and got me with the next available stylist. I didn't really feel welcome or comfortable at all. 

On the positive side, my stylist, Maggie B, did a wonderful job! She gave me the best shampoo/head massage I've ever had and was very sweet and attentive. I would come back for her for sure! She really took her time and made sure I was happy. 

When I was leaving, the staff must have finally had time to return my calls because I got two calls (from the stylist's personal cell phones) asking what time I wanted to come in. Kind of weird. Apparently the owner is the only person that can do anything at the front desk but doesn't regularly answer phones or book appointments. 

Overall, the experience wasn't very good but the stylist was wonderful. I'd go back for Maggie but don't expect much from the owner/front desk."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful gel mani and pedi here recently. My tech was Nicky and I highly recommend her the service deserves 5 stars. The polish was done so smooth and no chip for almost 10 days. She did a great job, very detailed and professional. I gave 4 stars because I didnt really care for the pedi station. It was not comfy, it has a cushion and pillows only kinda built in station."}
{"text":"Doesn't deserve any stars! The way I was treated as a first time customer was despicable! No wonder, for the 2 1/2 hours I was in there, I was the ONLY customer. I wish I had read these reviews before I wasted my time and my money. First and LAST time customer!"}
{"text":"I just had a gel manicure and spa pedicure from Nikki at Salon Nouveau. They were on Living Social and I thought I'd check them out.  I was 5 minutes late.  It's not the easiest place to find. The girl at reception was the same girl who did my service,  Nikki. She made it abundantly clear that she was not thrilled to do my nails given it was through Living Social.  I asked about a French Manicure and she said \"Oh that's extra and I don't have time because I have someone coming right after you.\"  I tried to make the best of it and be as friendly as I could be. It seemed that she was warming up a bit but then she saw that I had an acrylic nail on one of my nails. \"I wish you would have told me before because the nail polish remover eats through acrylic and I don't have time to fix it because I have someone right after you and you were late,\" she said. No one wants to constantly hear about the appointment after them as if the person is not fully present for your appointment.  No one wants to be chastised either. She asked me if I wanted my nails cut down but I was too afraid to say yes because she was in such a hurry.  The rest of the appointment finished in silence. My appointment for a gel manicure and spa pedicure was at 9am. She finished by 10:30am. I thought I'd wait until my toenails were dry before I left. At 11:00am a customer came in. Nikki said, \"you're early.\" Her appointment wasn't until 11:30am. Then why did I feel she was rushing with me the whole time and chastised me for being 5 minutes late? She does a decent job but her customer service is the worst. She will not get repeat customers if she continues with that attitude."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for a few months now. I am sorry but these reviews are extremely off. I have personally talked to the owner who after an error on my part fit me into her schedule, how is that a person who is rude? I never really review but these reviews are strange. Everyone from Vanessa, Bri, Karen and Leayer are all very talented and amazing artists and people."}
{"text":"This shop advertised on Groupon but the lady said they can't take appointments until next week.  I feel they should say that on groupon in their add.  

I will have to get a refund now from groupon and they have lost a local would/could be customer.  

Meh, so many shops in town to spend money at.
Guess I will buy this somewhere else as a gift.

Update 5 minutes after leaving this review:
So, the owner (Vanessa) called me and we spoke about this situation.  She advised me if there was a cancellation tomorrow she could get us in or Tuesday for sure.  She also called my mother and told her she would call her next week as well.

Vanessa was nice, explaining she is a mother of 4 and last time they ran this add they had the same problem.  She said they had over 300 groupon purchases.  So, knowing this is a reoccurring problem as an owner I would state that in the Groupon advertisement.   

She did call me after hours to try and speak to me the first time but I couldn't understand her due to the spotty cell coverage as she was driving.  So, if I misunderstood her my apologies.   

I am still trying to get a refund through Groupon as I wanted to get something done for my mother tomorrow.  We will see what happens.

I will give her another star because she called again but I still feel mislead by the advertisement not saying they may not have openings for days out.  If I had seen that I would have known what to expect."}

{"text":"If you want the best hair cut and color you MUST go here. The staff is exetremly style savy. Whether you're looking for the hottest new trendy look (like my daughter gets) or a refreshing touch up (like me!) This is definately the place to go. The staff is attentive, kind, and has bent over backwards to work around our crazy schedule to ensure we are looking our best when we need it."}
{"text":"I am really impressed with this salon. Especially by Cece - my stylist. 

I won a $50 gift certificate a while back through a raffle. I finally got around to using it since I was in need of a haircut. I called Cece at about 9 am and she was quick to get back to me. I made an appointment for 12 and that was that. 

It was frustrating to locate the actual establishment since it's pretty tucked away. But once I got there Cece was waiting for me at the door and quickly seated me. I talked to her about what I wanted and she quickly got to work.

Although the service was technically free for me, she did not treat it as such. She put a lot of time and effort into my hair, and gave me recommendations as to what would look best. I was super impressed with the result and she was even nice enough to straighten my hair for me. I also really enjoyed the fact that she kept conversation light and short. I definitely appreciate stylists who place their attention on my hair, instead of trying to make conversation.

I look forward to returning for other services sometime soon!"}
{"text":"the worst experience of mani/pedi of my life. started from disrespectful treatment from manager/owner(?) to a sloppy unprofessional job done by employees. if it would be possible id give (-) 5 stars."}
{"text":"The worst salon on the planet!!!
I went to get my gel nail manicure and pedicure done after I purchased the living social $35 deal. The nails were done by Chloe Adrianna DeTillio. That was on Saturday at 2 pm, at 4 pm one of my nail fell
Off.. I was like , alright, I'll call the salon. When I called the owner said there were closing and I'll have to wait until Tuesday to get them fixed. She didn't apologize or sound concern. Who cares I'll walk around with one of my nail chipped off for a few days!!
So Tuesday comes and by then I have all my nails come off . I call in the salon to see if I can swing by to get the nails  fixed and the owner picks up the phone . As soon I explained to her I'm the one who had called on Saturday she tells me she's gonna \"transfer \" me... She \"transfers \" me to the voicemail. I call again and she did that 4 times! Finally I ask her: Excuse me, where are you transferring me to? She answers: To the reception!!  and she hangs up.
So I drive over there. I walk in and the owner is getting her hair done playing a possum she's not the owner. The reception lady tells me there's nobody who could do my nails today. I ask for refund. She tells me she needs to talk manager...and that..the owner is off today...!!
I was thinking to myself it was kind of a joke or something ... So what I do is I walk over to the nail area where I got my nails done and who I see is the girl who messed up my nails!!! I just couldn't believe my eyes!! She was with a customer so I tell her that my nails  all came off and I need to get them redone. She looks like she had nothing to do with it and tells me she was busy. So I go back to the reception lady and tell her that that's the girl who did my nails and I ask her why she had told me there was nobody who could fix my nails? She answers that she didn't know that girl does nails. All she knows she does ..hair!!! At that point I was like: really, wow, no way... Do you guys know each other at all or you are all strangers here????
So I insist on getting my money back at that point because I realize I don't want to stay at that crazy house anymore... Then , finally, the owner AKA customer with her hair getting done comes out of her possum like state. She comes up to me and squeezes me upper arm and starts pulling me towards the exist saying I'm interrupting the service and that I needed to leave.. I ask her to give me money back so she threatens to call the police. So I left. I walked out and called the living social. They told me they don't refund once the coupon is redeemed and that I have to settle with the owner of the salon. So...what I do is I call the Henderson police! Yes! I felt like I was treated like a criminal being escorted out from the salon. The police came and did the report but I didn't want to proceed any further with it. All I wanted is my money back that's all. The officer from the Henderson police was very nice and understanding. He went in there and spoke to the owner and ,of course ,her two and a half witnesses denied that she had grabbed me..and she still wouldn't agree to refund the money , so I just left her like that with that. I called the living social again with the police officer and they credited me with $35 being understanding as well. Everybody was understanding and in their right mind but the owner!! Why would she do living social deals at all if she's not interested to get out of her way and keep the customer??? Instead, she scares them away!! And she needs to open up a theatre company not a nail salon. It was the show I could only see in a big movie production..Just simply unbelievable!!
Will never go back there ever again!!!
Don't ever buy their living social deals either !!"}
{"text":"BAD, BAD, BAD customer service. The receptionists ( I spoke to several) are all so rude! I too had a GROUPON and was treated like a second- class customer. I too was told to purchase my discount at the salon (wierd). Both my husband and I have been regular paying customers for 1 year. From the time I made my appointment to the time I walked out the door I was made to feel extremely uncomfortable. I did not receive a blow-dry or style because the salon was closing!!!!! WHAT? Even the worst of all salons will never allow a customer to walk out of their salon with wet hair....... This afternoon, after being out of town for several days..... I called back to ask if I could come back to have my hair re-trimmed because I still have split ends. I was told bluntly that since I was a GROUPON customer that I would have to pay for another haircut and in a very \"finger-wagging\" way told me that I should have at least \"made a phone call\" to inform them of this sooner. Maybe so but HOW RUDE!!! THAT IS NONE OF THEIR BUSINESS!! HOW DARE SHE?? Judging from the overall rating and reviews for this salon, the owner of this place seems to care very little for customers, new and current.... very sad. I am done with this place as well."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon for a mani & pedi and struggled to get an appointment because of limited availability on my end and inconsistent answering the phone on theirs. I assume fellow groupon holders and clients (if they have any) were overwhelming their schedules so had to book in a month in advance. I went to my appointment and the place is nice aesthetically speaking. Staff are personable and even though I was 15 minutes late (damn navigation) they were quite accommodating and took me back. Here is where an early Halloween came into play. 
1. They have colors bought from drugstores and Sally's it seems not an opi on sight, no premium salon quality polishes one expects. 2. My nails were filed with the roughest nail file and had sharp edges which I had to ask her to correct. 
3. The color I chose was too thick and my technical immediately added acetone to the color to 'thin' it. So I had terribly uneven polished toes. I could and did a better job.
4. I chose another polish for my hands and the color was new but due to an untrained tech my color has lines and is uneven. I attempted a correction but the correction still looked like a high schoolers polish job. 
I won't be back for my nails. Not even if it was free until they get some trained professionals in there. The nail room chairs need to be wiped and the polishes need an update and a few nail polish representatives. They seem to do great hair. The place is nice. The technicians are very pleasant. But do ur nails at home or at your regular salon for a good job. Save your money y'all (Paula Deen voice) it ain't worth your money right now!"}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon for a mani/pedi from this salon. I *really* needed to get my nails in shape, so I bit (and went for the upgrade, which they weren't very subtle about). The mani and pedi were great. The girls who worked on me were so incredibly nice and the treatments were fabulous. I felt like a million $$. 

So, why 2 stars? Well... I felt a bit pressured to purchase an upgrade to my mani/pedi. I told them I would decide on the upgrade at the time of my appointment. When I came in and requested the upgrade, I overheard the owner and the receptionist discussing it. \"I sold her an upgrade.\" \"Oh THANK YOU so much.\" Not a big deal, but I didn't need to hear it, okay?

As I was leaving, the nail tech rung me up and misunderstood the tip I wanted to leave on my card. Again, not a big deal at all--she actually charged less than I'd said. When she tried to correct it, a woman named Vanessa (the owner or manager, I'm guessing), came over to help. She treated this poor woman TERRIBLY. She spoke down to her and basically scolded her in front of me. Then, as she handed me my receipt, apologized for the woman and made some remark about how we made everything okay. 

The nail tech did nothing wrong and I was so uncomfortable for her--I just wanted to give her a big hug. I'm sure that running a salon is stressful, especially with Groupon traffic, but, still.... Hopefully, the talented folks that work at this salon can find better gigs. I, for one, don't want to support a place where the people providing services aren't treated with respect."}
{"text":"Seriously, do NOT waste your time or money on this place. They are horribly unorganized. It takes forever to even get in touch with someone to book an appointment and even longer to get in for service. I can't quite understand why bc the salon is an absolute ghost town and with such terrible service I can understand why. After booking an appointment with them several weeks in advance and rearranging my schedule to make the appointment, they ended up booking me on the wrong day!?!? I should have read the reviews before wasting my time."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon Now for a Wash. Haircut and Style for 25 bucks. When I got to the salon they complained I bought the Groupon BEFORE getting there since they would have honored the 50% off and made more money since after Groupons cut they don't get the whole 50%. The front desk lady complained about this fact to EVERYONE she talked to. I got no wash and for a style I got a simple blow dry and no products. I would have been better off going to Fantastic Sams for the same service and less price even with the Groupon."}
{"text":"Absolutely ridiculous and horrible. I went in hopes of getting a walk-in, I couldn't, okay that's fine. Then the dreadful receptionist told me since I was a Groupon Customer, I had to be on a waiting list and they would call me when a manicurist has a little time- with 50 people ahead of me. So I asked if I could make an appointment 6 weeks out. No, because it all depends on what the 'regular' customers schedule first. Mind you up until this point I was very nice, joking around and being polite. Then I just could not take her attitude anymore. And I asked why I was being treated like shit, a lower customer because I purchased a Groupon? She just continued to repeat herself and yd me to get my money back from Groupon. Why did they put out a Groupon if they don't want the customers???"}
{"text":"This place is aweful, bought the living social deal, it is should be Named Beauty School Drop Outs. It took an hour and a half to complete a pedi, they didnt trim cuticles, the equipment was rusted, the gel polish was thick and cheap and thank goodness it all peeled off the next day. I would like my money back but I am afraid they will offer me a free return service and you couldn't pay me to go back to that place. I actually called living social and told them they should be ashamed to promote this business."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible customer service! Called earlier this week to to book an appointment with a Groupon, and they said to not buy the Groupon but that they would honor the same price so Groupon didn't take their cut. A bit odd, I've never been asked to do that before, but okay. Contacted them today to confirm, and they refused to honor the Groupon price and canceled my appointment! Said I could keep the same appointment day and time if I paid more than the Groupon price. No thank you - found another salon. Should have read these reviews first!"}
{"text":"I just moved to Henderson from San Diego and wanted to try this Salon for all of my facial and nail needs. I bought a groupon for a gel manicure and pedicure. I called four days in a row to try to book an appointment was was told two times that I would recieve a call back, the fourht time I called I was treated horribly and was told that maybe \"I should just  get my refund back. I understand that they were booked but to be treated like this is unacceptable. Only did they know that I get facials once a month and pedicures and manicures once a month the potentiol business they lost is thier bad call. I would never recommend ths place to anyone, and in all my years going to salons, never been mistreated like this. you think with the  Las Vegas having the worst economy in the country that they would welcome someone who wants to increase their profitablity. Bad business move on thier part."}
{"text":"Vanessa is amazing. Specializing color, hair extensions and Brazilian blow out. I am from NY andI have been to so many hairdressers.   I have color every 3 weeks and bring my 87 year old mom.I also had the Brazilian blow out amazing results She is knowledgeable, punctual and so accommodating.  Returns phone calls and is flexible    I love her.  I Highly recommend Vanessa"}
{"text":"Save your money!
Bought a $29 Groupon for Gel nails & pedicure $60 value I paid more for the French tip but none of it was worth it. 
Had to book 3 weeks in advance. 
The tech was friendly.
The pedicure itself was good but the seating for the pedicure is awful and uncomfortable.
The gel nails chipped the next day.
They tried to fix them by painting over them.   They believed they were doing me a favor, I still tipped. 2 days later they started chipping again.
I don't recommend this place even with the deals."}
{"text":"Had a groupon to try this place out and boy did I waste money. It's 24 hours since my gel \"manicure\" and 2 nails have peeled off already. There was no soak, no cuticle cutting and the polish is coming off a day later? I can't believe I paid extra for it. The lady was nice and made an appointment for me with my hectic schedule but even my husband after seeing my nails yesterday was like wow they did a terrible job. I was there for 2 hours and left unhappy. I will not be returning in the future."}
{"text":"If I could give a minus number, I would. Made an appointment with Melissa 8 days   my scheduled appointm ent for a base color, highlights and a haircut. When I arrived yesterday, Melissa was not there, but arrived shortly after our 2 PM appointment. She began by asking if we were just doing a 10 minute color. I replied that As I stated on the phone when I made the appointment, I wanted a haircut and highlights as well. When I came out of the restroom, she informed me that she had to go pick up her kids because her mother-in-law was ill and not able to. She then rambled on about how her husband was out of town, how she had two new puppies, that she was leaving for Fiji on Friday,  and that her boss, the owner, Vanessa would do my hair. She rambled on about how competent Vanessa was. Though my first instincts were to leave, because I found this to be VERY unprofessional, I stayed because I am going away for the weekend and was badly in need of the services that  I had booked. Vanessa did a good job on the color, but she took my shoulder length bob up to my chin, and repeatedly stated she didn't take off any length from the sides. This is the worst haircut I have ever received, looks nothing like the picture I shared with her and there is no way I will ever go back there, because there is nothing that can be done to fix this! When paying she added $30. on to the charges for toner and then asked for a gratuity, which I did give, in spite of the fact that it's not customary for an owner to expect a tip. I cried all the way home, woke up this morning and cried again and even my husband, who generally is very supportive couldn't get over what a bad haircut it is. I now know why they have such a low star rating."}
{"text":"Not sure what Matt is talking about.  This place is great! If you were offered a wig it's because you need it sounds like your a dude any way. Plus they don't sell wigs.  You probably should do a bit more research on places before you write a bad review that's obviously false!! High class salon with high class service.  A+."}
{"text":"Bri has been doing my hair for over 5 years! She totally gets what I need when I'm getting a new style or need regular maintenance. Love it when she beautifies me!"}
{"text":"Bought a groupon deal for this place I would much rather go to any other place to get my nails done . I should have read the yelp reviews first. The nail tech I don't think knew what she was doing.. she didn't even scrub rougher skin areas barely even got all the old polish off. I didn't even want her to finish with the gel nails the customer service sucks, when they were running behind she said it's because they were doing me a favor by fitting me in and I tried to make small talk with the nail tech and she was pretty mute. I had her stop in the middle of service and I walked out Horrible. And never again"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. The owner needs to learn how to be nicer to all clients. She was extremely rude when I tried booking an appointment and was very defensive about honoring Groupons. She doesn't seem to be an effective communicator either because the nail tech seemed genuinely surprised she had a nail appointment with me. As a result, I waited 30 minutes for my appointment. This would have been fine if the nail tech was able to accommodate me and do the service I wanted. I probably would have been able to get a nail tech capable of the nail design I wanted had the owner taken a minute to listen to my request. At the time of booking I asked about getting someone who could do nail designs but the owner didn't care and said I'd have to wait until my appointment to ask. My nails came out okay but, I would have liked to be able to walk out with what I wanted. The nail tech was sweet but, not as thorough as my regular experiences at other places."}
