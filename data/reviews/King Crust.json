{"text":"I have been here at least 5 times in the last 2 weeks. From the pizza, the veggie wrap to the Greek salad. Everything has been excellent every time. The pizza was hot on pickup and delicious. Read a couple of the negative reviews and definitely not the experience I've had or my friends I've sent there."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza- loved the gluten free Margherita pizza!  Warm and friendly service, attractive and comfortable surroundings. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was waiting for a quick/reliable food shop to go in across the street from the Bower Hill condominiums.  This place is reasonably priced and offers a wide variety of hoagies, pizzas, apps, etc.  I have tried some of their specialty pizzas including the buffalo chicken and hoagies including the cheese steak.  Always ready in the time frame they provide which is typically 20 minutes when I order.  The staff are friendly and the shop is kept clean. I wouldn't say it is anything unique but the service keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza place in the Mt. Lebanon area. The crust is perfect, with many options like wheat, gluten free, or regular even. The pizza sauces are great and the toppings are fresh. Their wings are also really good, crispy, but not dried out. My son doesn't want delivery from anywhere else now."}
{"text":"Order simple pepperoni. It was still raw. We didn't enjoy it. Bland sauce. In the land of Mineos, campitis, Badamo, you hope this one would be on par."}
{"text":"Great pizza, fresh ingredients. Fast and friendly service. Modern dining area. Healthy options. We enjoyed our visit."}
{"text":"Thought I would try since it was new.  I had a grilled chicken salad and my parents had a steak hoagie.  The salad was over priced for a bit of cold chicken, a few cucumbers, grape tomatoes, green pepper rings , a lot of cheese and packaged dressing.   My parents steak hoagie was large and they said it was good. I may give it another try for pizza or a hoagie but I can get much better salads elsewhere for a much lower price."}
{"text":"Thank you, thank you, thank you! I was just recently diagnosed with celiac disease and was devastated to think I couldn't have pizza again, and if I did I was convinced it would be terrible. I stumbled upon your shop and all I can say is AMAZING! Thank you for producing such a delicious option for those of us who would otherwise be left out."}
{"text":"We stopped in last night to give it a try, We got a basic half cheese half pepperoni and a salad and ate in. It was just Meh, Ive had better. The pizza seemed like it need more seasonings and salad was ok. For eat in, there could be some sort of service, bring out the salad first while the pizza cooked, but they like to bring everything together. Next time we will stick to our favorite, Crust! Caf√© and Pizzeria on Painters Run Rd."}
{"text":"Stopped back for a second try, and this time I tried a Cheese Steak Hoagie on regular bread (the wife got a veggie hoagie on gluten-free bread again), and I thought the hoagie was O.K., but not that great.  I was pretty disappointed that the tomatoes they used were very unripe.  Also, the hoagie itself didn't have a ton of flavor (I added mayo (which they do have available in packets) plus a lot of salt and pepper to try and give it a little more taste).  I still may give this place another try again in the future, but as of now, I am giving it an \"A-OK\" rating."}
{"text":"New pizza place next to Rite Aid in a location that once was a Bakery/Coffee shop (Life is Sweet).
Grabbed a Italian Hoagie that had the usual ham, salami, pepperoni with provolone, lettuce tomato onion and Italian dressing.  A pretty good hoagie.  The menu has wraps, salads, wings, stromboli and a couple of desserts.  KC has traditionally, multigrain, whole wheat and Gluten Free crust."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place to get pizza. The best I could say is it was ok. Nothing very special about it. Picked it up once at home and got their pizza at work. Both times it was just ok. Not a lot of flavor. Not a lot of toppings. I probably won't try again."}
{"text":"Haven't been in this area in sometime so I thought I would give this place a try. Set right in the middle of a construction zone-yes those orange barrels are out again, you have just enough space to \"squeeze through\" two of those cone heads if you are heading away from St Clair hospital towards Scott Twp.

Situated in the former \"Life is sweet\" bakery cafe, the parking hasn't changed so it is easy for people to \"double park\" behind one another as was my case.

Take out is available and you can order ahead of time online if you prefer. Once inside the setup is similar to the \"Life is sweet\" cafe. There are tables in front and some in the back along with reading material. Free WiFi is available. Passcode given upon request. I thought I would take advantage of the lunch pizza special since you get two slices of cheese pizza for just under $5.00 which includes a canned beverage or water.

I asked about toppings and learned that any topping from the board can be ordered for an additional $.50 each. I asked about the choice of crusts. I was told that with the special all I was entitled to was the traditional crust. If you want the whole wheat or multigrain then you would have to purchase a whole pie. The smallest size has 6 cuts which is way too much for me. So I thought I would try the special and go from there.

Yes, there are gluten free options available as well as vegetarian. No vegan here. I placed my order and got it fairly quickly even though the place was packed with kids and young adults.

I ordered the two slices with mushrooms and green peppers. The portion sizes were very generous but I could tell by tasting it that it may have been microwaved. The pizza was okay but not anything special that I would go out of my way for. It just reminded me of those take out chains (which I had previously noted you can do here) and is probably good for just that.

The two slices were more than enough for me. Didn't need a salad nor did I want to try a hoagie. Staff was friendly and pleasant but I didn't see how to dispose of my leftovers so I took it back to the counter and the clerk took it off my hands.

It is convenient to St Clair Hospital but dealing with both construction and parking can be a nightmare. If you are happy with those big box pizza places and delivery service then I'm sure you won't be disappointed here."}
