{"text":"Love the milkshakes.  Good old fashioned department store diner."}
{"text":"With the death of Zellers so to goes this brands diner, so don't bother.
We will have to see what comes from Target when they open in Spring 2013, however it may just be a fast food thing like Wal-Mart/McDonalds."}
{"text":"My friends and I are on the lookout for lunch counters inside department stores.  Remember them?  (Know any???)  Kresge's and Woolworth's used to have them.  \"What's 'Kresge's' and 'Woolworth's'?\" you ask?  Sigh.  I'm quite elderly.

Anyway, we found this diner inside a Zeller's and decided to try it out.  It was no old-fashioned lunch counter, but it was a 50's style diner that served decent food.  The breakfast special was pretty average.  2 eggs, bacon, toast and coffee for 4.99.  3.99 if you're \"55 or better\".  Note - this doesn't include potatoes which were an additional 1.29 (or so).  This was quite odd.

My 3-item omelet (mushrooms, peppers and cheese) was quite good at 4.99 + 2.99 for the 3 ingredients, but in this case the coffee wasn't included, so that added 1.99.  It was bottomless, but that is at the high end of coffee prices at diners, in my (vast - see list) experience.

Sooo, if you're going to be shopping at Zeller's, or anywhere in this mall at Victoria Park and Danforth, don't hesitate to pop in.  If you want a homier greasy spoon, however, you might want to go to Smiley's at Danforth and Main.  http://www.yelp.ca/biz/smileys-restaurant-and-deli-toronto#hrid:DAo4MmnCpU8OpOaicqfVKg"}
