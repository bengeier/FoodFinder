{"text":"Three strikes and I'm out.  Ive tried this place thre times in the past 8 months.  First time went for drinks and food after a game. Nachos came out burnt with the cheese having gone crispy - way past melted.  Second time I went with my daughter. We had fish and chips. The fish was not crispy but greasy when we put a fork into it. Third time,  two of us went for lunch.  Service was incredibly slow even though there was only two tables being occupied ( 1.5 hrs from start to finish).  The \"closer\" chicken burger and side salad was decent. Raspberry poppyseed vinaigrette was excellent.  Also had an angus burger with portobello mushroom that was mediocre at best.  Be aware - a baked potato is a side option but it's a joke. My potato showed up cold. No apology from the server. It only comes with a packet of butter.  If you want sour cream be prepared to pay another dollar for it (on top of the already high price of $16).  I might return for drinks at the bar but I won't be returning for the food any time soon."}
{"text":"Although this place needs a RENO badly...it's got GREAT food!  Wow!  Maple Bacon Burger was super with probably the best sweet potato fries I've had anywhere!  We ordered 2 of them to the patio...fast friendly service!  Can't wait to go back...love the menu updates!"}
{"text":"Get the Rib combo it's called the dipped and tossed or something like that... make sure its done with the Kansas city sauce on both and sit back and be amazed.. Seriously you don't even need teeth to eat these ribs, I especially love the crack additives they add.. mmmm good. I thought this was so good that I came back 3 nights in a row and tested the same meal 3 times and it was rock solid perfect everytime. best ribs I have ever had. and about the best wings too!

After eating this I was so in aww I forgot the name of the plate!"}
{"text":"Sad food.  Great service. But the shepherds pie had flavorless meat with just cold ketchup on it, it literally was the only thing that had taste. Also, the other party I was with, got beef stroganoff, which looked as if someone just threw a bunch of random brown stuff together in the kitchen with a little bit of pasta. Very disappointing, especially since the prices are a bit high for the type of establishment. 
Two stars for the server, and despite the bad food, the place was very clean."}
{"text":"Went here to see the Bisping vs GSP fight. My boyfriend and I came here last minute, sometime around 10pm and surprisingly we weren't charged an entrance fee to watch the fight. The Brampton one on Steeles does. Anyways, we couldn't find a seat and we were told that before we entered, we stood and watched the game and were immediately noticed by the bartender if we wanted to order anything but we said no as we just ate.

We stood for about 10 minutes until a server asked us if we wanted to sit...she came back not even a minute later and said she had a table for us. We were so happy :)

Our server came us, asked us if we wanted anything to drink I ordered a blue freezie (basically does taste like an alcoholic version of a blue freezie)

She took so long to come back to us, but we didn't mind because we were distracted by the game. We ordered 8 piece wings - plain. They were fine, nothing special...just plain old wings ..that tasted the way they were supposed too.

We saw a group of men leave the booth across from us, and we asked our server if we can take it. Luckily she allowed us (a couple taking over a 4 person booth to watch a big UFC fight) was incredible. She earned a good tip because of this action alone :) 


I would definitely come back if you want to experience a general sports bar type of vibe. It's decent, nothing memorable but not horrible."}
