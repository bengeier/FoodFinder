{"text":"Easily the best pizza I have eaten since I moved out of the Bronx. There is a really nice selection of wines you won't find in Cleveland AND they are reasonably priced. It is as though they wanted their patrons to sample new wines and not go broke in the process. I had the margarita pizza and it was incredibly delicious: fresh and not at all heavy. In fact, I ate my leftover slices for breakfast. 

Overall, this place will be the go-to spot for pizza in Cleveland. Good ethos, nice staff, good selection of beer and wine and the prices are more than reasonable."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, charming atmosphere and great staff! If there is a wait, you can walk across the street to Stone Mad to grab a drink and they will text you when your table is ready.  The radicchio salad was delicious. Pizza crust was perfect. Ordered the #2, #4, #5 and #7 and enjoyed them all! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been itching to go to this place ever since I heard it was opening.  And it did not disappoint.  I've been here twice trying something new the second time around and the flavors were spot on both times.  They also have a good selection for beer and wine.  It definitely is a hidden gem hidden away near Gordon Square.  I highly recommend this quaint little place. Be prepared to possibly wait for for a table. They will call you if you decide to step out to let you know your spot is ready.  A must try!!"}
{"text":"Such a great spot. The venue is on the small side, so get there early or go on a weeknight. The staff is generally very friendly, especially the owner. The pizza is amazing. The crust is so flavorful, and the ingredients are fresh and tasty. It's my new favorite pizza joint in the neighborhood, and it's great to take home as well."}
{"text":"Man, I so wanted to love this place...New York style pies, a space with a with a cool vibe and right in my (soon to be) new neighborhood...but sadly it did not quite live up to my expectations.  We came with fellow Detroit-Shoreway neighbors who have been several times, and their assessment was similar to ours.

Here is a run-down of our meal experience.  My wife and I shared a house salad which the server graciously split for us.  It had a nice mix of flavors with its goat cheese, sunflower seeds, fried capers and tangy (slightly creamy) balsamic vinaigrette dressing.

For the table we shared two pies, the margherita and one of their \"signature\" pies called the diavolo.  I will say their pizzas are on the expensive side, but are pretty reasonable in size.  The margherita had a perfectly charred thin crust, they really have that aspect of the pie nailed. But, the cheese and sauce were not what I would have expected from a New York style pizzeria.  The red sauce lacked depth and \"brightness\", but I would call the overall pizza decent.

The diavolo pie also had a fantastically charred crust and was served with their standard red sauce, chilies, spicy salami and tangy red onions; this pie had more flavor than the margherita due to the toppings.  The spice / heat of the salami and chilies built the more you ate, but overall the sauce left a void in its overall flavor.

We will most likely return to try some of their other sauces to see if we find something we really like, but our quest for the perfect pie in the Cleveland area continues..."}
{"text":"A small menu works when everything on it is done well.  The meat and cheese board serves 2-4 and the salads each serve at least 2; they were delightful starters while waiting for our pizzas.  Great crust, great service, and reasonably priced.  A friendly neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"Nice little pizza joint in a charming neighborhood in Cleveland's Detroit Shoreway Gordon Square district. Limited menu of pizza and salad. Short wine list of Italian wines. Full bar. Pizza is good, but not the best. Seems the restaurant is stuck somewhere between New York style and Neapolitan style. The ovens are New York style, and produce pretty good crust. But the red sauce on the pizza is missing something. It's somewhat bland. Does not compare to the finer sauces made with real San Marzano tomatoes. There are far better pizza choices across town on the east side for true connoisseurs."}
{"text":"Our new favorite pizza spot in Cleveland! This pizza is the closest to New York style that we have found. Amazing quality/freshness/ingredients. The staff is always friendly and accommodating. Can't get enough!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in the CLE ... so the place is busy most nights.  Not a big deal to wait across the street and have a couple drinks.

The menu is simple and straight forward.  Everything I had was excellent.  The secret to the pizza is the crust.  It's all star quality.  A slight crunch with a great chew.  The toppings are simple and well executed.

A lot of good thought went into the wine list.  Everything I've had there is a slam dunk.  

Atmosphere is vintage CLE, gritty urban immigrant chic.  They did a great job in restoring a hidden gem of a building (old grocery from what I heard).

The host is a lot of fun.  He sat down with us and told lots of stories.  It just added to a great experience."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Pizza however was very disappointing. The marinara sauce is very watery. The crust was hard and dry. The meat tasted stale and the ingredients did not taste fresh. I was disappointed with the overall experience. The service however was great and everyone was very friendly. Pizzas came out quick."}
{"text":"A definite stop in Cleveland. Great vibe, service and pizza.

Price was also reasonable.....they only have pizza and salad, but the do it GREAT!!"}
{"text":"Place is dope. Staff is dope. Pizza is dope. Loved it. You can tell someone gave a damn when they opened this place."}
{"text":"Can I just start with.... the BEST crust I have ever had.

This place is right around the corner from my boyfriend's and we have been eyeing it for MONTHS. We kept walking past it a few months ago anticipating an opening date. We finally got the chance to go last night and it definitely exceeded our expectations.

We got a large margherita pizza (which reminded me so much of Italy!) Yum. They also had a great wine and beer list. I definitely recommend the pino giorgio! The service was fast and the interior was adorable. The lights are set low for the perfect mood, but makes it difficult to take pics of your food! It was also fun to see the chefs in the kitchen cooking away. 

Il Rione does not accept parties larger than six at the time and reservations are not accepted. I recommend going later in the evening (we went at 7:45 p.m.) for a guaranteed table. Nonetheless, it is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Cool space true to the area.  Pizza feels like blend of Neapolitan and New York.  Good wine and beer list to pair with pizza bur short and straight forward.  Great attentive staff."}
{"text":"Had the arugula salad, the green pie, and the norma. Everything was delicious. The Norma was my favorite for sure. The eggplant with the ricotta in the Norma were fantastic. The salads were also a highlight. Come for the pizza, but get a salad! Everyone I was with agreed that they were pretty great. 

Beautiful build out, chill vibe. It's a tiny place, but I didn't feel cramped. Service was friendly and timely."}
{"text":"Amazing. Ordered the cheese board, house salad and a pepperoni pie. Such a cool vibe in there too. Would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Cleveland. It's nice to say that and actually feel good about it because for a long time it didn't mean much. There are some quality pies out there, Vero Bistro in the heights is legit and Bar Cento is respectable, usually, but finally a great pizza in Cleveland. Job well done, wish you guys much success."}
{"text":"This was some of the best pizza I have ever had, and I've eaten a lot of pizza! Crust is delicious, they don't skimp on toppings, and everything tasted really fresh. The restaurant is really nice too and they have a cute, cozy patio!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and delicious food. We had the Radicchio salad and Margherita pizza which were both fantastic! Also had the meat and cheese tray which had a great assortment. 
The service was spot on and the owner was present and welcoming! Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Nice service, and welcoming environment. Ordered two pizzas. One was great, however, they got our order wrong on the other. The order was taken verbally as opposed to written down, and I asked if they had it correct in the beginning, which I was told would be correct. When it finally came, it was incorrect. So got the order wrong. When the correct pizza came, it was burnt. 

The incorrect pizza was not charged, which was nice. However, I do not like when places insist on not writing down orders and getting it wrong."}
{"text":"When I heard Il Rione was going to be making Jersey-style pizza, I started Garden State Fan-Girling long before they opened. These guys got it all right: the decor, the cozy neighborhood atmosphere, the simple - but simply perfect - salads and the bar that is the hub of the hub-bub that gives Il Rione the 'everybody wants to be here vibe'. Their crust is something you can't describe - but it is the exact taste and texture of the shops where I formed my opinion of what makes a perfect pie. I love recommending this place, because everyone should enjoy authentic Jersey pizza. And because the Brians work hard to make Il Rione the best neighborhood pizza place we all want to come back to again and again. It's a simple menu, but, if you don't know what to order - ask - they love sharing their passion with their customers."}
{"text":"The best pizza ever!! This is a great up class pizza joint. Great setting, great staff. We came on a Wednesday night, it was busy but didn't have to wait long. We will be back."}
{"text":"Pizza so good my dick fell off

Really good crust

Wonderful exposed brick

Solid location

Smooth atmosphere 

Ready to try again"}
{"text":"Abbe, myself and two neighbors from the neighborhood had dinner on a Saturday evening.  The margherita style pizzas were the best anywhere.  The pizza style and topping selections allowed for everyone to have the pizza they wanted with no compromises.  The drink selections were really good, including Sanpelligrino Italian Sparkling Fruit Beverages, made with real fruit juice and real sugar, not that high fructose corn syrup  nonsense.

Fabulous experience, we will be back soon."}
{"text":"Was very excited to come try Il Rione once I heard it was opening, their concept and how they were going to make their pizza. First time I went, I brought my parents who were visiting from out of town. We all were craving pizza badly and I knew Il Rione wouldn't disappoint. As soon as we entered, we were told they are out of dough. I understand completely how fresh ingredients make a difference, especially if items are made in house but to run out of the main foundation for which your offering, it was a little upsetting. So we went to XYZ instead.
Went back a second time (My number if something goes wrong where I eat) and had high hopes seeing rave reviews again and consistently. This tome I brought a friend and again, we were craving great pizza. We ordered wine and the arugula salad to start. Since there was only two of us, we opted for a medium however, our waitress told us we are out of dough for mediums and only have large size available. I actually didn't mind that until I asked her if she is going to justify the prince since we only wanted a medium. She said no. At that point, I was ready to just cash our bill and leave. My friend and I caved to order a large supreme pizza. Pizza came out and it was huge! Looked great. Sauce and veggies tasted great but my friend and I both agreed, the closer to the top of the slice, the more soggy the dough got to the point where everything fell off. 
Thin crust is thin crust but I've had many thin crust pizzas in NY, Jersey, Cleveland, even Chicago where the dough holds up to its weight and is crisp underneath. I wish them the best of luck knowing they have a many a-followers but I won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Fantastic Cleveland spot. Pizza is delish.  Salad is tasty. Drinks/beers are well priced. Service was good even though we came late in the night.  I was of course skeptical of such high reviews for a pizza joint but it lived up to the hype. Well done!"}
{"text":"I called for a take out pie, and was put on hold for 7 minutes.  When the bartender finally got on the phone, I was told to pick it up in 45 minutes, which I did. I checked the pizza when I got in the car, and it was completely cold. I now have it in the oven.  Not sure I'll bother with this place again, although I was excited that they were in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"I wish I could select 10 stars! I had a favorite pizza since I was a kid and never thought it could be topped and Il Rione blew them out of the water!!! They have hands down the BEST pizza, ever. From the fresh and high quality ingredients they use to the style of pizza, it's just SOOOO good. I live out of state now but I'm from Cleveland and I am dying to get back just so I can have Il Rione's pizza again! Not to mention the atmosphere is amazing and so are the owners and staff! These guys know what they are doing, do yourself a favor and go there immediately!"}
{"text":"It's like real Italian pizza!  I wouldn't say this is a good date place, but it seems like a place for a few friends to have a great pizza and some drinks."}
{"text":"New pizza spot comes about in Cleveland and I had to give it a shot. First off I'll say this place get pretty packed on the weekend (Friday and Saturday). So best to get in early or be prepared to wait a bit. Second, if you actually get past the waiting patiently(or impatiently) the pizza here is well worth the wait. 

On a cool Saturday night, we ventured to the newly opened pizza spot on the west side and after a 15-20 minute wait, we were seated. The inside ambiance is rather relaxed and fitting for the location.  We ordered the large pizza Diavola  with added anchovies and also a large Diavola. The pizzas both came out fresh. A perfect combination of cheese and toppings evenly distributed.  The dough itself was light and slightly crispy and and the sauce was very complimentary. All n all this has now become my second favorite pizza place in Cleveland."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice now. Pizza and service both times were great. Very attentive. The pizza reminds us a lot of the pizza we had while in Bologna, Italy recently. 

If I could suggest a few things...1. having a hostess stand at the front door or having more defined area where guests check in. 2. LOVE the music but tends to be a lil loud...nothing like yelling while conversing with your server 3. serving the spicy chili oil (that they serve alongside pizza in Italy)

Overall our experience has been great both times. We plan on coming back many times over and anxiously await the opening of the patio"}
{"text":"Have you ever walked into a place and just knew it would be great? This is one of those places. We came in on a Saturday night and luckily got a table promptly. Our waitstaff was friendly, attentive, and efficient. Salads came out quickly, and were delicious. I could just go there and eat salad every day! But....the pizza.... We ordered a margherita with pepperoni, red onions, garlic, and portobellos. It was amazing!!! Perfecto!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give 10 Stars I would! I have lived in this great state of Ohio since the mid-80s and love so much about Cleveland but unfortunately not the pizza! have missed the East Coast New York style pizza that I was introduced to many years ago when I married a native New Yorker. This rather bad day turned into a wonderful night when I tasted the first luscious morsel of pie! The atmosphere is homey and comfortable...... the owner-friendly and very informative. I want to spread the news about how great the pizza is because I want this establishment  to stay in business for many years to come so I can scarf down many slices. It is by far the best pizza I have ever tasted in the Cleveland area. The house salad was fantastic also.
."}
{"text":"Pizza is a little on the pricey side but totally worth every penny. We live right around the corner and have been a few times since they've opened. Great wine list and the margarita pizza is just to die for. So happy to have this place in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Opening night!!  We went late.... only 6 dough balls left said the waitress....so we ordered pies and PBR!  Very excited with the build out, the location and the pies....I'll be back. Clam pie was good. Diablo was better the green pie was OK"}
{"text":"Small menu, no frills, and excellent execution.  Great addition to the neighborhood and exactly what we needed.  Pizza is made with quality ingredients and is best fresh out of the oven- go after that first slice right away when it comes to your table.  The style of the pies is a cross between Neapolitan and New York.  Been twice, and haven't been disappointed."}
{"text":"So happy to finally have a ny style with hours I can make it to. Have already tried so many pizzas from here, highly recommend everything! Great prices for an amazing quality pizza, drinks are inexpensive, and the location is beautiful. 

Will be the hot date spot for sure.

Pictured is the supreme - a must try for any pizza lover"}
{"text":"Great people and great NY Style Pizza!  Definitely recommend this East Coast NY style Pizza"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in cleveland. Reminds me of when I live in manhattan. Only wish it was coal oven like Lombardi's on spring, but this place is still great;)"}
{"text":"Cleveland needed this pizza place. It is an amazing addition to the west side food scene. 

I can't decide if I enjoyed the arugula salad or the diavolo pizza more. Margherita was also excellent. 

The staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome - it was full except for 2 person tables so we sat at the bar and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is the closest to NY style pizza I've come across in CLE. Which also is what I'd imagine Italy would serve up. Thin, crisp toasted crust, cheese that stretches, and all fresh toppings in a foldable slice. If you so choose, they'll grate garlic clove over your pie."}
{"text":"I saw a friend post pictures of the pizza on Instagram and immediately knew I needed to try this place. We went on a Saturday with another and there was a short wait and he directed us to Stone Mad across the street for a drink and said he'd text us when our table was ready.  I already loved them because I love businesses supporting one another ... we had time for a quick drink and our table was ready.  Each couple got a pizza to split and both were incredible.  Our friends got a salad which I sampled which was equally as delicious.  We loved it so much we brought another couple with us the next weekend.  I'm directing everyone to get dinner here as soon as they can.  They do run out of dough because they make it fresh daily so plan to go a little early!"}
{"text":"Well I loved the pizza. For sure I will order take out. We sat outside on the little patio and it was really nice. I wasn't thrilled when there was lipstick on my water glass (I wasn't wearing lipstick). The margarita pizza was delicious but I needed a little more sauce. I would have appreciated a heads up that it would cost me 1.50. I certainly understand extra cost I just like to know about it before I get the bill. All in all like I say d the pizza is yummy enough that I'll order take out. No reason to eat there."}
{"text":"Love this place.  My favorite date spot in Gordon Square.  Split a large with my date and took a few pieces home.  The pizza, drinks and service is all fantastic.  Have had both the diavolo and green pizza, personally liked the diavolo better (if you like spicy food I would go this route), but the green pizza was also very good (esp if you like pesto).  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood pizza joint. It is actually really nice inside with a lot of tables. It's dimly lit and candles everywhere so actually would be great for date night. Got the arugula salad which was so good. The crispy fried polenta and the dressing were addictive. The margherita was really good - I like a simple pizza. Husband got the sardine pizza (like pasta puttanesca on dough). He liked it. Thin crust.  I think this is the closest place in Cleveland to a New York style Neapolitan joint."}
{"text":"So, we had heard that Il Rione was a good find on W.65th, so we thought we would give a try. When we arrived it was kind of crowded, but as luck would have it, everyone else was waiting for a larger table and since there were only two of us, we were seated right away,  We were greeted by our server promptly, and were served drinks and placed our order. That's about where our luck ran out. After about 45 minutes (and I'm being generous here) I got my server's attention. \"What's going on?\", I asked. I assumed that the server would know what I was inquiring  about, but she looked at me puzzled, and said, \"What do you mean?\" After I told her that we had been waiting for our pizza almost an hour, she said she would check for us, and proceeded to attend to another table.
About 5 minutes later our pizza arrived. We had ordered a large margherita pizza w/ 3 extra toppings. I should mention that the cost of this pizza would total $24  with the extra toppings ($17 for the pizza, + $7 for the extra toppings)........not cheap for a pizza. When I tried to cut a slice for my wife, I couldn't transfer it on to her plate without all the toppings sliding off the pizza, and the underlying crust falling off the fork at a right angle. It was soupy! Either too much sauce, or too thin of a crust to move.........whatever. The extra toppings I had ordered: portabella mushrooms, onion, and roasted red peppers were hardly visible. As for the taste........not terrible, but far from anything special. Call me picky, but I expected a lot more of a $24 pizza. The sauce was pretty bland, and as I said above, the toppings were very sparse. Soon our server came over and asked if all was ok. I told her that if I were to rate the pizza I would give it a 4 of 10 for the reasons described above. I want to emphasize that I was not irate or confrontational, just factual. She asked......I told her. Soon afterward, I assume one of the owners came to the table and said, \"I understand your not happy with the pizza?\".  \"It's not great\", I responded. I was ready to explain to him why, but didn't get the opportunity. Instead, he said, \"You won't be charged. God Bless\", and walked away. I thought that was little strange. If it were my restaurant, I would want to know exactly WHY the customer was unhappy with it. 
Now for the weirdest thing...... About a minute later, someone else from management approached the table, looked over my shoulder at the pizza and then said, \" I just want to see what you consider 'Trashy Garbage'\", and walked away before I could say anything.............Those were his words, not mine. By this time, We had enough. Our server was nowhere to be found, so I asked the hostess to bring the check for the wine, if there was one. She returned saying there was no check, you're good to go. So we did! 
So that was my first and last experience at Il Rione."}
{"text":"Had to try a new place out! Glad I did. It was packed on a early weeknight evening. Sat at the bar. Everything was delicious, and the pizzas are neat. It just took a pretty long time to get both drinks and our food which was sad."}
{"text":"I don't care what anyone else here says- my favorite pizza in the city. I live 2 blocks from Little Italy and my husband drives here to pick up our pizza. LOVE it!"}
{"text":"Finally tried Il Rione and finally a great NY-style pie in the area!!  Not heavy, not greasy, and great ingredients, etc.  Sharp little spot right by Toast, Stone Mad, etc.  Proper char on the crust (it's not burnt, dummies!) as well.  They offer a couple of cocktails and have a few very nice Italian wines available also.  

A no brainer that I'll be back!"}
{"text":"FINALLY! A New York style pizza restaurant. Had the clam pizza. Best since we had at Pepe's in New Haven, CT. Also had sausage and pepperoni . High quality toppings. Crust was charred and thin, just as it's supposed to be. Service was good and pizza were on table quickly. A+ experience and we took two pizzas to go !"}
{"text":"I went to a pizza party here over the weekend. The DJ was playing some good rap music. I enjoyed myself and had a couple drinks. They did a great job on the renovation of the building.

My Dad grew up in Queens and Long Island. I was born in New Jersey. My confirmation name is Umberto because of Umberto's Pizza in New Hyde Park, NY. I visit family out east many times throughout the year. I bring back Regular, Sicilian and Grandma pies and freeze them. I then reheat and eat when i come home drunk. I will still bring back Umberto's on future trips. I don't need to bring back as much.

I like Neapolitan pizza more than the regular stuff found around Cleveland. I think that once pizza was brought over from Italy it was improved upon in NYC. I would prefer a good NY slice of regular over Neapolitan. The crust and cheese were excellent. The pizza reminded me of Sam's in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn which is an outstanding place.

I like the hillbilly pizza at Angelo's on rare occassion. I have no reason to eat pizza anywhere else in Cleveland now. In my opinion it is better than Vincenza's or Marotta's. 

WIsh my old man was still around to see that Cleveland finally got a decent pizza place. I will eat more in his honor."}
{"text":"NY pizza fans, rejoice.  This place is serving up some mean pies - perfect crust, fresh and simple ingredients.  A great product, executed perfectly.  

It's going to be hard to get a table here on weekend nights, and that's a good thing.  I wish this opened in Ohio City, but I'll consider myself fortunate that this opened at all.  

[Also, did anyone read Mitch Z's review?  He'd like a glass for his beer.  Thanks.]

TIPS:
Favorites:  Diavola, Pepperoni Pizza, and Green Pie.  Also, the Arugula Salad is very nice.  

No appetizers, one large is perfect for two people.  With an app, a small pizza is enough."}
{"text":"I never knew this place existed. It's north of the main Detroit Ave Gordon Square drag. 

It's a small restaurant that was totally full on Thursday evening. Pizza, wine and a few salads. The menu is simple, but what's on it is done right. 

I got the sausage pie from the recommended list. The large size is really big and can be split easily by two or three people. It came with red sauce, mozzarella, sausage, roasted peppers, sautéed onions, garlic, parmesan. The crust was super thin, but could support the pizza and didn't get soggy from the sauce. This pizza came out a little on the sweet side and wasn't spicy. It's no doubt a crowd pleaser."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here! Lovely food, lovely drinks, lovely staff and just general decor and vibes were nice and welcoming. The pizza was uhhhMazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza here! I already heard great things about the new place in town so was eager to try. I had the Green Pie with added prosciutto- my friend and I finished the entire large pie, was very delicious. Especially the crust! Will look forward to the next time I try. Great beer selection as well and my friend enjoyed her wine, too. The ambience of the restaurant was also very nice- the music is not loud and you don't have to shout over one another for conversation. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We had been driving along on a sat evening and checked out Yelp.  So many great reviews about how wonderful the pizza is sooo..we drove here a short wait and we shared a glass of wine and beautiful salad and small pizza which was plenty for 2 people. .really pleased with the attentive service and selection of pizza . We will be back with some of our friends"}
{"text":"Place is fabulous. Nora was also so sweet- great wine choice. Small place, small menu, but so great. Pizza was fab. Wine was affordable and pizza was thin crust, made right in front of us. So good. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"New York has finally come to CLE. Best pizza in town. Makes you feel like you are in NYC having a pizza without the attitude. 

Friendly service in a nice neighborhood place that has an upscale casual feel. 

The pizza is perfect. The crust is just the right crispy and cheesy with great toppings. 

Salads looked good and I'm sure are just as fantastic as the pies. 

I will definitely be back and will be proud to show this joint off to my New York friends"}
{"text":"I have to say I was disappointed on my first visit.  There was a lot of hoopla when this place opened and I've got to say I wasn't impressed.  I will tell you why.  

1.  I arrived with my guest Thursday evening.  When we arrived there was a party on the south side of the building.  It appeared to be the owners friends and family.  They were extremely loud.  So we sat at the north side of restaurant.  In looking out the windows, all we saw was an alley with a dozen trash cans.  Who wants to look out at that sight?  A shade or blind would have made a big difference. 

2. We ordered beer.  My guest was given a can and I a bottle.  We should have been asked if we wanted a glass.  We would have said yes. 

3.  We both ordered salads.  I liked the house salad, my guest thought it was bland.  

4. We both ordered pizzas.  I a small pizza and my guest a large.   They were good, but didn't knock our socks off.   With the amount of crust on the pizza, it would be nice to offer pizza sauce on the side for dipping. 

5.  The owner was walking around and visited tables he knew.  Since it was our first time, we did not get a visit and an opportunity to meet.  I happen to be the head of our neighborhood social committee and would have loved to have given a great review of this place to the neighborhood, but I will not be doing that.

6.  Based on the above, I rank thus place as mediocre.  I won't be rushing back."}
