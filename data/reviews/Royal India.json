{"text":"Ordered take out a couple weeks ago for the first time. Portions are very small for the price. I ordered the Butter Chicken, Basmati Rice and Garlic Naan. It was alright. Not the best i've ever had. This would be my last go to place is all others were closed."}
{"text":"Food was great. Very good and authentic. The people were very nice. And the mango smoothie was delicious."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the food was terrible.  Portions were small, considering the price.  Ultimately it didn't mater because it was inedible.  We threw away the saag panner - it was SO SALTY!  Not exaggerating, not able to eat! I cannot recall the other dishes we ordered, other than the naan which is half the size of naans you get in other restaurants.
Will not be reordering."}
