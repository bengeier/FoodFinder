{"text":"We made an early reservation before seeing a show at Espace Go next door. The place is bright and airy with a great design concrete bar area with large windows open onto St. Laurent. It was busy with the theatre crowd on Saturday evening.  We hit a bit of a snafu when the host couldn't find my reservation and jokingly asked if I reserved under an alias but he told us it wouldn't be a problem to accomodate us.  The menu was interesting, representative of the various cultures that defined Montreal's famous world expo in 1967 as well as Montreal.  We tried the octopus with falafel and the duck \"balls\" and both were very good and well priced. The duck plate was beautifully presented with great color on the plate. The \"mignardises\" was the perfect sweet ending - a quartet of mini bites including a hazelnut financier, macaron, cassis gelee and what tasted like a homemade coffee crisp bite...a steal at 4$  Service was friendly and attentive with the waiters taking the time to explain the dishes.  The portions are tapas style and it does add up to sample a few plates. Its a great place for a small tasty bite however."}
{"text":"Came here for a valentine s day dinner with my fiancee. We wanted to try the tasting menu, but she is allergic to shellfish and they wouldn't make any substitutions. We decided to try 4 small plates (which, we were told, were between the size of an appetizer and a main) and split the steak. The steak looked impressive (house aged for 45-days). The waitress told us that sadly, they were out (at 7:30 p.m. on February 14th). She recommended the beef on the tasting menu but wouldn't let us just order that dish. We would have had to both take the tasting menu and simply skip out on all the dishes involving shellfish (3 out of 8).   We ended up getting four plates: the smoked salmon, the bonbons de confit de canard, the sweetbreads with declinaison de bettrave and the gnocchi with foie gras. Now, I must admit, this place has incredible plating. We were awed by how carefully and beautifully the plates were put together. Unfortunately, that's about all it has going for it. The Salmon and the Sweetbreads came first, and though beautiful, there was nearly nothing to eat. (The salmon had four bite-sized pieces with some bagel chips, while there was only one sweetbread and a few beets). Then came the bonbons de confit de canard and the foie-gras gnocchi. The bonbons were good but again too few for the price (4 little balls with an interesting barbeque dipping sauce). The Foie gras gnocchi involved about 6 pieces of gnocchi in a bland sauce with two pieces of warm (though not at all seasoned) foie gras.   After this, we were still both STARVING, but decided that we didn't want to spend another cent at this place. We got the bill and were shocked to discover that for such a paltry amount of food and a glass of wine each, the total was nearly $200 with tax and tip. We paid and felt terribly ripped-off. We then went up the street to Mais and their tacos hit the spot for a much more reasonable price.   If you're looking to spend a lot of money to be awed by plating and don't mind being ripped off, this is the place for you. If you're looking for an actual meal that involves adventurous cooking, interesting flavours and originality, don't bother. This small plate trend in Montreal  is like the Emperor's New Clothes and needs to end. Tapas should be inexpensive and delicious snacks, not a buzzword for serving very little to your customers and pretending that less is really more. What bothered me most about this experience is that Projet 67 embodies dishonest food and riding trends to make as much money as possible off of customers who don't know any better. Why not take a page from Maison Boulud or La Chronique? You can still do impressive plating and have original food while feeding your customers an actual meal.  For shame, Projet 67, I expected much much better from Jean-Francois Vachon."}
{"text":"Projet 67 tire son nom de l'exposition universel de Montréal de 1967. Vous comprendrez donc que ce resto propose un menu orienté sur le thème de la découverte internationale, mais aussi sur les racines culinaires montréalaises.   La soirée a bien débutée avec la sympathique sommelière qui est venue nous proposer ses choix de vins pour accompagner notre repas.   En entrée, nous avons choisi le canard de Pékin. Il s'agissait d'un beau morceau de poitrine laquée et rôtie sur l'os accompagnée de châtaignes d'eau, de brocoli chinois et de champignons shitaké. Une présentation soignée et, surtout, un pur délice. Nul besoin de spécifier que la soirée commençait fort.   Par la suite, mon choix s'est porté sur une assiette nommée « L'inspiration d'un bourguignon ». Il s'agissait d'un plat composé d'un belle pièce de viande de cerf de Boileau tout juste saisie, accompagnée d'une délicieuse croquette de pomme de terre gold du Yukon et crème fraiche à la ciboulette, de cipollini, de lardons croustillants et de champignons pieds bleu sautés. Ici encore, toute une assiette ! Savoureuse et balancée.     J'ai terminé le repas avec une croustade aux pommes. Rendu au café, le chef Jean-François Vachon a passé quelques minutes à notre table afin de prendre nos commentaires. La grande classe. Quelle soirée et quelle bouffe !  En bref, Projet 67 vous offre une véritable expérience gastronomique. J'imagine que l'établissement ne va pas tarder à s'imposer parmi les belles expériences culinaires de la métropole.   Je recommande fortement l'endroit et j'y retourne volontiers."}
