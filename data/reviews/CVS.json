{"text":"Horrible customer service. Went with my mom to get passport pictures done. Camera was not working. Only had one kiosk working. Manager was very rude. Didn't even ask who needed a picture taken. Horrible! Get it together. Especially if your a manger."}
{"text":"I don't think I expressed enough how awesome I think  the staff at the pharmacy is at my location on Thunderbird Road. Ben ( who I call the leader ) is absolutely the best. Ben will take his time to listen to you and actually hears what you have to say. Any concerns.... Ben will talk to you until he is sure you understand. I love that in any person. Chris Weely is also fabulous, Chris will actually tell you exactly what you need to know, you can feel his sincerity which I appreciate so much in this crazy world we live, it is refreshing to have employee's that care. I always feel welcomed and I love being called by my name. ( that they remember is incredible seeing that they deal with thousands of people a day. ) I highly suggest you check it out , I will bet you will change your medications to this store due to service you will receive. I would be stunned to hear otherwise."}
{"text":"The store had what I was looking for, but there was no greeting when I came in the store. When I was checking out, the manager directed me to a register for her to check me out. Went to her register, she rang up my items and I hear a cell phone that is not mine. I see her look under the counter so I assumed it was hers. As she is finishing up my items, she pulls the phone out to look at the text message. She continues to hold her phone looking at the message as she's finishing up my stuff. I guess she's so engrossed in the message she didn't have time to say anything else to me. I guess that is common practice there if the manager is doing that. How can she correct her employees? Follow by example."}
