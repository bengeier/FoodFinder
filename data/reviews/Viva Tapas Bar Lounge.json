{"text":"I was a part of a party of \"13\" reservation on Saturday July 3rd. The Service was HORRIBLE! The owner tried to make things work, but in the end, things only got worse. I have over 5 years of experience in restaurants and client service so I know how a restaurant \"should\" function. Water and bread was not brought to the table unless we asked 3-4 times, it took an hour before the waiter took our order, Only a couple of entrees were served at a time, After an hour of the other girls waiting, two of the girls had never received their entrees. When the main course was delivered, the same thing happened. After 4hours of being in the restaurant most of the girls at the table were not served what they had originally ordered. The restaurant did not excuse themselves and did not make it up to their unsatisfied clients. If we were warned that our food would have taken a few hours we would have not stayed. A table of girls next to us made a right choice in leaving after of 2 hours of waiting and not receiving any of their service. The only thing I can say that was great about this place, was the food and music. The food was well presented, and tasted great. But for those frustrated waiting too long for their service, all the greatness of the food was blurred through all the disorganization. I would never suggest this place to someone. Unfortunately they didn't put any effort in keeping control on their restaurant that evening. Only 1 thing may have passed my review but the rest ruined my experience completely"}
{"text":"Viva truly has is all - style, ambiance, food to die for, and unrivaled service excellence.  Located in charming Old Montreal, Viva offers an outdoor patio perfect for drinks, tapas, and people watching, and an indoor seating area for a more traditional dining experience.  The cliental is upscale, hip, and undeniably beautiful.  The owner, Max, is a constant presence and his impeccable attention to detail and dedication to his customers and staff is remarkable.  As for the food, you really can't go wrong.  The sweet potato fries, tempura, meatballs, mussels....it was all heavenly.  We ordered the entire tapas menu and every dish was top-notch.  The live music was also a nice touch, and we lingered for quite some time without feeling rushed.  The staff was extremely friendly and attentive, and they seemed to really enjoy their jobs, which I think is a testament to how well this restaurant is managed and run.  Viva is not to be missed - GO!"}
{"text":"I went ti Viva with a couple of friends from Spain, and we had the best time. The food, ambiance and service was stellar.  My favourite dish was suggested by the owner Max and I am forever thankful.  I thought that Old Montreal could not produce tapas and a rich experience, I was wrong! Next time I am in town, this is the first place on my list!"}
