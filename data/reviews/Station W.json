{"text":"Enfin un (bon) spot à café à Verdun! Excellent espresso/cappuccino, dommage que celui-ci ne soit pas équitable, seul point négatif. 

Ça n'a pas encore \"fitté\" avec mon horaire, j'ai très hâte de goûter à l'un de leur grilled cheese, surtout celui avec kimchi... Je soupçonne une certaine complicité avec les mecs de \"Tripes et Caviar\" localisés juste en face pour cela, et c'est très bien ainsi. 

Barristo et proprio très sympathique, décor minimaliste bien réalisé, lumineux, musique et ambiance générale agréable, wi-fi ... on a le goût d'en faire un annexe au bureau et au salon."}
{"text":"Le Station W, ou comment me sentir chez nous même si je ne suis plus dans mon Estrie natale. Les muffins à en mourir, le latté du bonheur suprême, les grilled cheese qui fondent dans yeule.

Aujourd'hui j'ai essayé le chai latté pis j'ai pas été déçue: ça goûte le vrai thé pis les epices parfaites. Je te love d'amour,  Station W!"}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood and was looking for a coffee place with food. Nice place with trendy  decor for the area. I feel more relaxed here compared to those big coffee chains. Service is more personalized, they bring you your order at your table after you ordered.  Good grilled cheese. I had the brie and mushrooms, delicious but wish they had normal bread instead of sour dough. Wish they had more food choices as well.  Also had a capuccino which was ok, not the best i had but better than the chains. I think it has good potential and would come back."}
{"text":"a \"third-wave\" spot that earns this designation not only by looks and ambiance, but the excellent coffee served as well. lever machines and baristas who pull consistently good shots every time i'm there. also a great place to buy whole beans. a great place to read/study as well, with wholesome snacks/food when you get hungry!"}
{"text":"5 stars; Perfect coffee; Worthy of infinite coffee praise; Hallowed Ground of the 8th Dimension of Coffee Royalty. 

However: 

I keep ordering the classic cheese sandwich for $3.50. It is acceptable. My friends at Station W: Please make it perfect and delicious by adding a higher quality cheese. Perhaps a cheddar? Anything that isn't of the grade you are currently using. 

I am glad you use Premiere Moisson bread (I spotted the packaging); Now, again I say, match your sandwiches only with cheeses that are worthy of your name; If you make the perfect grilled cheese, you will be the Heaven, the Divine Hall of Montreal.

Also, it pains me to say this because the coffee is so good, but the desserts are absolutely average. They are somewhat satisfying but, still, average.

There are very few vegetarian options as solid snacks. The salads and side-dishes will put food in your belly, from my limited and nearly-infringed vegetarian experience, but are, shall we say, lacking in seasoning and spice. I nearly yawn. More vegetarian options (seasoned) of this nature, please? The bacon bits nearly killed us.

Otherwise: 

Come here for the perfect coffee; Pretend everything else is satisfactory because the staff is amazingly kind and deserves praise."}
{"text":"Ive been coming here since it opened. Great coffee and atomsphere and Service! It's def one of my favs and its close to my hood.I proud of Verdun and its infinite  selection of great bakeries and restos!"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit after reading the favourable reviews. I wanted to see for myself.
The breakfast sandwich was excellent, but my coffee was served to me after most of my sandwich was eaten. (Excellent coffee, by the way. )
I also love to read a newspaper while eating breakfast. Unfortunately, the only newspaper available was \" La Presse\", a huge newspaper that is twice the size of the small tables. A tabloid like the \"Journal de Montreal\" is much easier to read, which is why you find them in most restaurants.
The decor is minimal, bare white walls, the tables are close together, but I will probably go back to try something else. Too bad they don't serve fresh fruit with their bagels and cream cheese."}
{"text":"Best specialty coffee in Verdun
 If you re in the area don t bother with coffee  at Cafe St-Henri on Wellington. 
Station W uses real barista machines unlike their neighbours..."}
{"text":"ce cafe offre une variété de boissons chaudes et smoothies. ils font un excellent mocca! le service est très agréable. et leur choix de sucreries est complet. les pains matin, le pain perdu et le brownie sont délicieux! ambiance est cool."}
{"text":"The sandwiches and pastries looked very good and the Batista certainly enjoyed making his coffee's but we didn't end up staying because the atmosphere was more conducive to a student study hall or young family get together's. 
I will try a sandwich to take up next time"}
{"text":"You don't have to go to the plateau for excellent coffee or ambiance anymore, Station W has it all! 
Excellent service along with a great selection of sandwiches and salads to go with your coffee.

I definitely recommend this place to someone who wants to meet up with friends and catch up over a latte and light meal. Likewise, it's also a great spot if you want to spend some alone time to read or write (laptop friendly).  It's brightly lit by natural light and you have the added option of sitting on their terrace during those summer months.     

It's super clean as well, kid friendly with a super large and clean restroom (important for families)."}
{"text":"Superbe petit spot à sandwich au fromage fondu sur la Well dans Verdun.
Les salades étaient fraîches et semblaient toutes appétissantes. J'ai choisi celle aux coquilles et la salade d'épinards ainsi que le grilled cheese brie et champignon. Un vrai délice et assez de nourriture pour me sustenter.

Pour boire, j'ai pris leur fameux iced brew café avec lait d'amande et ce fut le highlight de ma journée, tout simplement.

C'est un peu cher par contre, 16$ pour tout cela mais ça ne me dérange pas quand je sais que je peux compter sur la qualité et un bon service. À bientôt !"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great vibe -- terrific place to study or work. Music is not ear-shatteringly loud unlike the countless hipster cafes in the city.. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe in Verdun! I came here with a friend and was pleasantly surprised to see how big this place was. Not only that, but they offer way more than just coffee with goodies ranging from home made grilled cheese sandwiches (several varieties), to fresh smoothies, and salads.

Prices are fair and service is great. Can't really ask for much more!"}
{"text":"Une nouvelle place pour du thé et du bon café sur la rue Wellington. Nouveau, tout est relatif, on va dire que je n'y vais que très rarement mais j'aime assez l'endroit. Y a du bon wifi et c\"est cool. 
J'aime bien la diversité de grill-cheese qu'ils offrent c'est sympa."}
{"text":"Their hot chocolate was great and their chicken BLT tasted amazing. The place is located near metro de l'eglise and is a perfect place where you can study and eat a meal. The only issue we had was that their wifi didn't work at that time."}
{"text":"This business is the reason why Verdun is rapidly evolving to a younger, stylish, good-looking neighbourhood. It's new, fresh, has great coffee and the interior decor is simple, but very elegant. I live right near by, and I will come back for more. I had a cappuccino, very tasty, great aroma and just bite enough. They give you a complementary bottle if water, which is amazing, since I was just off the bike path. The service is quick and always polite. Can't wait for my next visit to try something different!"}
{"text":"This is a really cute café. Very busy amongst the locals in the area especially students and paper correcting profs. Decor is cute hipster coffee shop-book shelves, fun art and greens. It's confusing because walking in you think you are being served- but you actually pick your own seats and order your food at the cash. After order, they will serve you the food at your table. 

I deduct stars because of customer safety! Their tiled floors were not fully covered resulting in so many ppl slipping, breaking  their fall. A be careful sign doesn't cut it!! Cover up the floor!!!!

Their go to menu is coffees and grilled cheese. I actually regret not trying their grilled cheese -Kim chi with shrimp soundes exotic. Instead I went with comfort and ordered from their brunch menu that runs from 9 am to 2 pm. I ordered the W special for 11$ without tax. This was not a brunch I typically enjoyed. It came with a dry mixed green salad (no oil or light vinaigrette), the potatoes looked like they were scraps of French fries, scones were very flavourful but so small in portion, the ham was good, eggs were ok, baked beans that were home made (probably the only thing that stood out in my meal). I got a chai latté that was more like warm ovaltine or Horlicks-again 5$ for a warm glass of milk?! No thank you!

Station W does not cut for Mtl's brunch list.."}
{"text":"Très mignon café qui a dernièrement ouvert ses portes à Verdun.
Que dire à part souligner le service exceptionnel et l'excellent café? Le Station W offre aussi des grilled cheese qui ont l'air tout à fait délicieux ainsi que des muffins et autres gâteries. L'endroit est lumineux, très propre et on a envie de s'y installer avec un bon livre ou son portable pour faire quelques travaux. 

Heureusement, c'est tout près de chez moi... Quelle joie!"}
{"text":"J'ai beaucoup aimé. Autant la déco que le menu. Prix abordable, 2 grilled cheese, 16$ (j'invitais quelqu'un). Mon grilled cheese raclette, canneberge et oignons caramélisés étaient parfaits!"}
{"text":"I love this little coffee place, I would spend hours working there when I didn't have Internet. Staff was always very kind and helpful. Only con, the chairs are not too comfortable....but perhaps I'm guilty to spending too much time in this little shop! Before I forget, they have great smoothies!"}
{"text":"The coffee was average, and the service was quite nice. It's a great place to do your work, but not for hanging out and having conversations. The atmosphere of the café was waaaaay too quiet for that."}
{"text":"It's a very good place for breakfast, they are very polite and fast and the food was delicious especially the wrap Matin and the chocolat chaud."}
{"text":"Bon endroit pour prendre un repas léger de bonne qualité.

Je suis venu pour une pause dîner avec mes deux enfants un samedi après midi. Le service était chaleureux et ils étaient très accueillant de mes enfants. L'ambiance est détendu.

On a partagé un plat brunch, une salade des fruits, et une smoothie. Toute était fraîche et avait l'air d'être fait maison. Je salue aussi le choix de donner des pailles fait du papier, pas du plastique."}
{"text":"Nice place to have a coffee or study. However, it is always packed with people and makes the temperature inside very uncomfortable sometimes...

Their coffees are okay, not my favorite. Their snacks are good."}
{"text":"Great place to study while enjoying a great macchiato.. homemade pastry and great grilled sandwiches.."}
{"text":"Petit café vraiment cute quoique \"crowded\". Viennoiseries et muffins sont super bons ainsi que leur café glaçé! Ça rajoute un spot cool de plus à visiter dans Verdun!"}
{"text":"This place is amazingly cute, spacious, comfortable, fast wifi, and serves great coffee. Great place to spend an afternoon and sip on a coffee while working. Croissant was well layered and buttery, and the coffee was full of rich coffee flavour, even when I ordered a milk based espresso drink. Really nice service too."}
{"text":"I cannot express how much I love Station W. 

My friend introduced me to this place, and ultimately introduced to me to my love of goooood coffee. 

I've tried almost everything on the menu (coffees, tea, food, dessert, pastries) and Station will forever be my go to when I want a good quiet place for coffee and/or to meet up with a friend. 

I can't recommend this place enough. Their service is great and they are always around for the Verdun street street festivals with their yummy creations. 

If you want to be spoiled, come here.

Start with a nice strong coffee (Americano or cappuccino, then a delicious grilled cheese. Finish off with a yummy scone or pain perdu). You will not be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Upon entering this cute little coffee shop, I was happy about the lack of commotion and the number of seats. This didn't take long to completely switch when people started pouring in. 
This was all fine, however there is only one very oversized bathroom to accommodate the entire cafe. The Earl Grey tea was amazing, made with real tea leaves rather than a plain old tea bag. 

They are losing stars on the coffee, it was extremely bitter and took basically a whole cup of milk and even three sugar wasn't enough to combat the fierce strength of flavour. 
The date square wasn't my favourite either. Once it gets busy the seating is very close together and gets uncomfortable and annoying when you can hear people chewing beside you.. 

I'd give it 2.5 stars if that was an option as two is a bit low, but three feels generous."}
{"text":"Super trendy and perfect for a cold day where you want to sit in a corner and sip away the afternoon. The Latte was frothy and perfectly roasted. I also had one of their gluten free salads (it was a cabbage salad and really awesome). Montreal needs more cafes like this and less \"Tim Hortons\"."}
{"text":"Aaaaah oui. 
Là, oui.

Grilled-cheese classique à 3,75$. Ça sent bon. Les croissants sont bons. Le café est top notch. Mes papilles dansent de joie, une genre de macarena des temps modernes. 

La grande table noire (12 chaises) me donne des envies d'enfanter. C'est correct aussi si tu préfères les bancs sur le bord de la fenêtre ou une table pour deux avec ta date. Il y en a une douzaine. Amène ton meilleur ami et sa date, aussi. Vous pourrez enfanter tous ensemble.

Les toilettes sont immenses et propres. Une autre raison d'enfanter, pour aller y changer 3 couches en même temps et prendre un autre espresso parce que c'est épuisant,  changer des couches. 

Le service? Oui. Mais j'ai un parti pris pour toi, barista barbu avec la tuque. Tu m'as charmée dès le début. Le menu est alléchant, aussi. Possibilité de créer son smoothie selon ses envies, extra protéines pis toute. 

Le désir d'enfant est reparti aussi vite qu'il est apparu, mais le désir de revenir ici persiste. Bravo, Station W."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had a latte and an amazing panini of carmelized onions, Brie and cranberries and it was hot and crispy. We also had a chocolate mousse. Delicious. Great atmosphere. It's like a coffee shop with a contemporary vibe."}
{"text":"Verdun est vraiment rendu un coin vibrant avec des nouveaux commerces vraiment cool qui ouvrent à chaque semaine! Et c'est vraiment le cas de Station W qui a ouvert il y a un peu plus d'un mois. Décor vraiment chaleureux et staff accueillant, on se sent la bienvenue dans ce beau café sur Wellington. J'adore aussi leur tables communes avec les lampes de travail au centre. C'est bien de savoir qu'on est encouragé à y passer du temps et même y travailler, si ça nous dit. Que ce soit pour y passer 5 minutes, prendre un café entre amis, passer la journée à travailler ou dîner, on ne se sent jamais pressé. Leur café est aussi à la hauteur - crémeux, bien rôti et qui n'est pas trop amer - et ils ont une belle sélection de sandwich et d'autres petites gourmandises. 

Seul hic : la grandeurs des cafés - 4$ pour un \"grand\" latté qui est sincèrement la même quantité qu'un latte standard dans les autres cafés de la ville. Ça, ça m'a déçue et me force à retirer une étoile. Si non, j'aime beaucoup."}
{"text":"Très bon café, le grilles cheese raclette est très bon, tout comme le chocolat chaud. Bonne ambiance"}
{"text":"Ce café propose un large choix de boissons mais aussi de grilled-cheese, salades et autres gourmandises sucrées. De plus, on y retrouve aussi un menu brunch très alléchant les fins de semaine. Les prix sont doux et notre gourmandise a été largement honorée. Au menu aujourd'hui Poutine avec fèves au lard, rosties avec oeuf poché et jambon, grilled-cheese raclette oignons caramélisés avec salade de chou.
Parfait! Le service est sympathique +++ et le lieu aussi.
Très bon mélange de café filtre maison!"}
{"text":"During my afternoon walk at work, I followed the smell of fresh brewed coffee and stumbled upon this coffee shop with nice industrial chic decor, great indoor space with plenty of seating and a terrace! As there was no outdoor sign up yet, imagine my surprise when I realized it was Station W! That's right, my fave brew shop in Verdun added a second location! I did not grab a bite here today but I can attest that if the salads are as good as their first location, I found my new lunch spot. I ordered an iced latte and savoured the creamy coffee flavour as I waltzed back to work, ready to face my afternoon of meetings and paperwork. So happy to have them across the street, although my wallet will feel it, and such a welcome addition to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"La Station W et son petit sandwich à déjeuner sur pain crouté, sont ma grosse source de motivation pour me lever et travailler. Endroit chaleureux, staff très sympa et courtois, il fait juste bon y être et heureusement, c'est à quelques minutes en auto de la maison. Pour les dents sucrées, il font de délicieux desserts maison. Mon caprice à moi c'est la barre Nanaïmo. 

Mon seul petit bémol, c'est qu'il n'y a pas énormément de parking gratis dans le coin, mais ça c'est pas de leur faute."}
{"text":"J'ai tout simplement été charmée par cet endroit. Le décor est super invitant er chaleureux en restant tendance. Le service était hyper courtois et sympathique. Le café était délicieux et bien fait. Je vais sans nul doute y retourner question d'essayer leurs grilled-cheese!!!!

Merci Coffee Indie Passport de m'avoir donné un prétexte pour enfin aller à Verdun essayer ce charmant endroit !!!"}
{"text":"Excellent café in the Wellington area of Verdun. Their coffee is on par with Stumptown and other Seattle/West Coast offerings, in an up-and-coming neighborhood of Montréal that happened to have a street festival going on that weekend all along Wellington.

I went there 3 mornings in a row while visiting friends in town. Got a very detailed description of the beans, none of it is black-roasted like you-know-who. Delicate but full-bodied flavor for espresso drinkers. Food was great as well. I had a plain croissant and the standard breakfast sandwich (arugula, gruyere, egg & bacon) on toasted bread. Delightful. They were even polite enough to listen to me mangle my order en Francais and thank me for the attempt at language diversity afterwards. I did not stick around, but it appears to be a hang-out spot for polite conversation and students/people with laptops.

Looking forward to brewing with the beans I bought and brought back."}
{"text":"Best coffee shop in the area, no doubt. All of the coffee drinks are excellent and reasonably priced. The ambience is warm and inviting. It has definitely become a community hub. The food is simple, fresh and fits well with the drinks being served. Great spot to get some work done during the week and lovely spot on the weekend to meet some friends and relax. The Cortado is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Sans contredit, le café le plus innovateur et agréable de verdun. Que ce soit pour un café intime, pour étudier ou pour avec un beau lunch sur leur terrasse, il est impossible de ne ps y trouver son compte . 
Le menu est composé principalement de grillcheese , de salade maison, de pâtisseries et de smoothies. 
Le personnel est gentil, et on vous offre un service très personnel. Le propriétaire est souvent là, et on y sent une ambiance très soignée (le coeur de l'endroit). 
Seul petit hic : les prix sont un peu élevés. Pour avoir vu des produits similaires ou supérieurs sur le plateau mont-royal à moindre coût, il est questionnable de se demander pourquoi."}
{"text":"Free parking on Sundays!

I give a 3* because the coffee is on the fruity side and I prefer the old school coffee.

I also had a butter croissant which was excellent. They  also serves brunches which is good for the weekends. The decor is also nice with a long wooden table at the back.  

Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Station W deserves an update of my humble opinion as to share how awesome it is. Week after week I have been frequenting the coffee shop and falling in addiction to the masterful black liquid the guys behind the counter deliver. Their lattes, cortados, macchiatos are amazing. There is a consistency in the coffee quality and the cheerful service. The baked goodies are perfect, nothing better then fresh cheddar muffin or gluten free brownie (which is unbelievably delicious) with my weekend cortado. I recently opted for their brunch. There is no mistake if you order the waffle with cream cheese and smoked salmon. The cafe continues to be very popular among the student community, but the brunch adds more liveliness and cheerful atmosphere to it. Some of the tables are reserved for brunching or coffee drinking people only, and devices such as laptops are not allowed during the brunch hours on them. I still enjoy more than any other area in the cafe the high tables along the window, but can't wait for the summer to come when I can just sit on the terrace and sip the perfect caffeine mix."}
{"text":"Really happy I ventured out to find this place. Coffee was great as was the atmosphere. Service was lovely. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Feeling like sipping on some delicious coffee on a cool evening? Café Station W offers just that! Since we live in the neighbourhood, my husband and I decided to take a look at this new coffee shop on Wellington street. He had an Americano and I had a Moka; the Americano was great and the Moka pretty awesome, rich and tasty! I could clearly taste in the Moka the dark chocolate and yet it was not overwhelming, a perfect balance of bitter and sweet. The subsequent times we went back, I tried the latte and found myself just as pleased. The decor is charming, simple and welcoming. Many books in French and English are also available to their visitors, displayed tastefully on a wooden bookshelf which makes up the whole wall at the back of the room.

We both agree this is probably one of the top 10 best coffees we've ever had in the city and, overall, our favorite coffee shop. I recommend!"}
{"text":"Meilleur moka en ville, avec le gout relevé de chocolat noir mélanger au café, latte excellents, en plus ils ont un menu de nourritures snacks et de diverses boissons, nice café un de mes préféré dans le sud-ouest"}
{"text":"I went to Station W to study and grab some breakfast. I had the breakfast burrito, which was vegetarian, and a latte. The latte was excellent, as expected, and the burrito was okay, not super flavourful, but still pretty good. The ambiance was really nice and comfortable. The service was great too. Seeing how this is close to home, I will definitely come back! I only ordered those two items and stayed for over two hours and never felt pressure to buy something else or leave, which was greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"I love this place already ! Very cute set-up and cool coffee machine - and my latte was great ! They have fun grilled-cheese for you to try, and I secretly hope they come up with new variations soon. Good spot to hang out and study !"}
{"text":"C'est un très beau café et c'est vraiment bon. Si j'étais du coin, je serais certainement un habitué. Petit truc intéressants, ils ont une mini-politique pour limité les gens avec leur laptop s'éparpille sur une table pour 2-3 personnes et réserve ces endroits pour leurs consommateurs qui voudrait y déjeuner. J'ai pris un double allongé et c'est un café espresso plus acidulé comme au Myriade. C'est à mon goût personnel, un peu moins intéressant en Espresso mais de loin meilleur en Cappuccino/Café Latté. C'est aussi dans le meilleur coin de Verdun, c'est-à-dire le Verdun plus hip. C'est gratuit se parker dans la rue le Dimanche, donc vraiment un bel endroit pour arrêter pour sa dose de caféine."}
{"text":"There are a lot of businesses opening up in the Angus Yards and Station W is the newest addition to the area.  When I wandered in here they hadn't even been open a week.  The original location of this coffee shop is in Verdun and it has long been in my bookmarks.  Alas, as I am rarely in Verdun I had yet to make it there.  The cafe has a gorgeous terrasse and on a sunny day it is nice to sit out there and take advantage of the beautiful weather.  I took my mother here for lunch and we did just that.  

At Station W you order at the cash and the employees bring out the food.  Our orders came quite quickly and we really enjoyed the food here. My shakshouka was packed with all kinds of vegetables and tasted really good.  That was accompanied by a berry iced tea, which wasn't overly sweet and was very refreshing.  My mother really enjoyed her falafel wrap.  I decided to finish off that yummy lunch with a brownie which turned out to be incredibly rich and gooey.  Personally I prefer my brownies a little more cakey but it was still rather decadent.  

I am so happy to have a cafe like this in my neighbourhood.  The prices are competitive with other coffee shops, the food is good and the staff are just so friendly.  Everyone here gives such excellent service.  It will be the perfect place to come for lunch or even just a quick coffee."}
{"text":"Petit choix de menu, mais c'était vraiment bon. C'est certain que j'y retourne."}
{"text":"It is an okay place for breakfast compared to other places in the same area. Food is fine, the coffee isn't very good. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"Great place for a coffee and breakfast. Friendly service, awesome grilled cheese sandwiches, reasonable prices, and fantastic decor."}
{"text":"Verdun has a series of cafes now popping up along Wellington and each seems to have it's own vibe and ethos. Some are more French, others are more artsy and yet others are more international in flavor.
This place offers one of the best cups of coffee and cafe drinks in Montreal.  Food is excellent as well particularly their unique takes on grilled cheese sandwiches and their chocolate mousse!  Their cappuccinos in particular and hot chocolates hit the right balance, not too sweet and not to bitter. 
Clean, spacious, with lots of light flooding in, vintage decor and super-friendly service, this is a wonderful spot to come in with your laptop to either work or study, read a book or chat with a friend over a cuppa."}
{"text":"A lovely new coffee shop in the neighborhood. Nice, minimal decor with slight vintage vibe. Good coffee. My boyfriend tried the kimchi and aged cheddar grilled cheese. SUPER DELISH!"}
{"text":"So far just had a cortado and used the Wi-Fi. Coffee was good, Wi-Fi was fast. My only complaint is that they close a bit early for my taste."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance though packed and sometimes hard to find a seat on weekend and after work, etc. Super sweet/accommodating staff, delicious pre-made sandwiches, salads, chili, good drinks and ok prices. You can get a nice brunch/lunch with one of their amazing grilled sandwiches, 2 salads or a soup/chili for about $10-12 and it's so filling. Really nice place. I've never tried but their cute brunches look amazing on weekends only."}
