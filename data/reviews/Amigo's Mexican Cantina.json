{"text":"Normally I enjoy my food here but tonight it wasn't very good, I ordered cheese enchiladas and chili relleno, the cooks forgot to put the cheese inside my cheese enchilada and a very small amount of cheese inside the chili rellleno as well as very little sauce on top of the chili, plus the  refried beans were extremely dry and lacked the usual creaminess."}
{"text":"About a year ago I used to go here practically every weekend.  However about a year ago something changed the food not as good as it used to be. One of my favorites used to be sizzling fajitas however now the quality is just not good they used to bring it to your table smoking and sizzling, they don't do that any more. Also the quality of the food is just not good any more either, for example the shrimp do not smell fresh and are now very tiny. If you chose to grande your fajitas which means upsize the meat portion they don't give you much more meat like they used to. Overall it used to be great food now it's just blah."}
{"text":"Awful. Came in before meeting up with some friends later on at the casino. Sat at the bar because I was by myself. Bartender was clearly irritated I wanted to eat at the bar. Food took quite a while to come and when it did it was bland and possibly the driest chicken I've ever eaten. Rolled the dice with a margarita but it was a gross bottle mix, thick and syrupy. Didn't want salt, but got salt. Poor experience and will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner.  Service was absolutely horrible.  Waitress was in a rush, threw the drinks down on the table and they were not very busy.  Never received our food but everyone else around us got theirs even after being seated after us.  Spoke with manager and he could of cared less.  Got up and walked out.  Do not recommend and will not go back."}
{"text":"The worse food ever, the manager had an excuse for everything; empty salsa bar poor service yet the cooks were standing around and visiting with the waiters. Then the waiter walked by our table three times until I had to ask him to take the dirty plate. When our main course was brought he didn't bring an extra plate for the fajitas or the condiments to go with them.  Very disappointed and will never go back."}
{"text":"This is another one of our regular places that we go at least once a month or more. On Friday night the place was packed but we still got a seat within 15 minutes.    Our server, Janice, was right there to take our order. Food came out quickly, quality was wonderful. The wife always gets the shrimp fajita's with lettuce cups which is a favorite meal for her. My carnitas dinner was tasty although a bit light on the quantity this night but still a good deal.    Ambience was good this night even though it was packed. Good place for dinner."}
{"text":"This was the worst mexican food outside of texas. The staff was ok but the salsa had no flavor, the combination menu said tacos and floutas but they serve taco (1) & flouta (1) . They were both so soggy they fell apart when picked up. Rice and beans were mediocre at best.  Do yourself a favor and head for the cafe, buffet, food court, or the convenience store down the road."}
{"text":"Don't know what the issues were that had the staff all discumbuberated but I hope the drama has cleared and customers are their focus. The drama  was a distraction and obvious.   The food was yummy! Tamales YES... PORK!  Very good!  Chimichanga wasn't fried crisp but the filling was better than most.  Good food my foodie partner wants to take his parents here! That's a good sign."}
{"text":"When we arrived we got seated right away and got our drink orders promptly.  However it took at least 15-20 min. for our server to return to take out food order.   The chips were the hard thick kind (I prefer the thin warm crunchy kind). The bean dip had pork in it which I could not eat.  The food was ok , nothing special.  I did not have that wow factor.  But we have to try new places to see if they are any good."}
{"text":"Been here twice in 2014.  Much better food and service than several years ago. We had combination plates with enchiladas, tacos, tamales, rice and black beans; and burritos too. All food was fresh and served hot. Kids menu has lots of choices and both my kids like eating here. Sundays and Mondays in May the entire menu is half off so expect a little bit (10-20 mins) of a wait."}
{"text":"When I want Mexican food this is the place for me. I like the atmosphere overall, chips and salsa bar, fajitas, and burritos."}
{"text":"Went for the 9 dollar fajitas and margarita.  We were very disappointed.  Arrived at 500 pm on Memorial Day and the place was busy.   We placed our order and watched for 45 minutes the bartender next door grab every fajita dish that the cooks made, clealy our order came out twice and he snatched it away to give to newly arrived bar patrons.   At 600 pm we finally complained and at 615 we were given steak and chicken that tasted like it had been sitting out for hours.   It was awful and we became sick the next day.   I heard other patrons complaining as well about the bully bartender with the glasses.  Do not eat the 9 dollar fajita special!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just another casino Mexican place with the same old food.  Not even good enough for a doggie bag."}
{"text":"Felt like eating some Mexican food but did not want to drive far to get eat.  Conveniently  located inside the Fiesta on the Northeast corner of the casino, it was a quick park and walk.  There was about a 15 minute wait and we were issued a pager and took a seat at the bar.  We ordered up a few margaritas at $6 a pop.  While chit chatting with the bartender who has worked there since it was The Reserve. He said that the brass monkey fixtures on the bar were one of the last remaining pieces of evidence old casino.  The pager went off and we were then seated.  Chips with beans and two different salsas are brought to the table.  For refills you are on your own as a salsa chip bar is provided near the kitchen. You can order a side of queso for a $1.99.  I don't recommend it.  It's like movie theater nacho cheese on steroids.  Because I am a sucker for bacon wrapped shrimp I ordered up some as an appetizer.  Not overly cooked and come served with fried onions. The dipping sauce is less than desirable.  I decided to go with a mexican caesar salad.  It was a generous helping and the chicken was grilled and still moist.  The service was a tad spotty as the waitress seemed super busy and we had many an empty plate on the table that sat there entirely to long.  Overall I did not hate the experience but the next time I feel to lazy to drive to another mexican restaurant I am going to suck it it and just do it."}
{"text":"I had the steak fajita today, the steak was tender and lean, the peppers and onions were cooked just right, perfect flour tortillas, the rice and refried beans were done just right, They seem to use quality ingredients, a big plus is the food wasn't oily like a lot of other places, and the staff was friendly,"}
{"text":"Average across the board - ok service and ok food.  Located in the Fiesta Casino, it offers the same menu as the other Station Casino Mexican restaurants.  As the others do, they offer a salsa bar with 6 different salsas and bean dip.  It wasn't kept as clean and tidy as I'd like.  I realize there are plenty of people serving themselves but I would hope they would keep an eye on things.  Service was ok.  Everything was kept short and sweet.  There wasn't anything spectacular or memorable but she did her job.  I ordered the taco salad.  This was just ok.  It was a little bland and had to add additional salsa to liven up the flavor.  But the fried shell bowl was fill to the brim.  Kudos for that!  I wouldn't rush back to this location for Mexican food but it would satisfy a craving."}
{"text":"We went to Amigos for date night and while the food was good the service was terrible!! We literally only saw our server when she took our order and after we got our appetizer and our food nobody ever asked us how our food was or if we needed anything! Won't be back here!!!"}
{"text":"WOW. Never again.... I must say, this is the worst I have ever been treated in a restaruant.   We were in the Target shopping center this evening, and where hungry. The fiesta is close..Why not? Mexican sounds good...Why not?  Well, 'Why not' yourself down to Sunset Station's Mexican restaurant, or to Chipotle. Or chevy's in the mall. Save yourself.  First off. The chips. Even though it says \"ala carte\" chips and salsa are $3.99, they are on the buffet. There seems to be a triage of colored chips...go for the lightest ones. They don't have a revolting burnt taste to them. Salsas were okay. The green one was one of the better ones.. even though I didn't mind the one that our \"server's assistant\" brought out originally.  We ordered waters, and I ordered a Pineapple Mojito.  The waters came...with about 3 ice cubes in the glasses. We were told that the restaurant was \"running low\" on several things (if that included ice, I am not sure), when we asked for an extra glass of it.  The first time we saw our waitress, she told us that a burrito and the fajitas were good. My guy asked if they had \"corn cakes\", and the waitress looked at us like we were from another country, before saying no. I asked which type of fish was in their fish tacos....tilapia (ick) and that it was frozen ((double ick.)) I went with the carintas tacos, and my guy went for the steak fajitas.  While waiting for our food, and my mojito........Our waitress never stopped by. Neither did her assistant. We were missing napkins, and silverware.. Finally, a manager, dropped off wrapped silverware in cloth napkins three feet from our table. She and I made eye contact, and I waved, she smiled and started to walk away. I then throw in more violent waves to get her to come over, so we could have some napkins, and eating utensils.  Servers who were with other tables, were quite attentive to their customers. We didn't even get our lady's name. Still waiting for our food, and attention.....and my drink.  A server/busser comes over with a tray, that isn't sizzling...so we know it's not ours. He attempts to drop it off, and we decline it.  seven minutes before our food comes, a hostess comes by with my mojito.  NOT WORTH THE WAIT. It was disgusting. watered down. A fake pineapple taste. We both had a sip of it and winced. The manager who gave us the silverware told us that our food should be any minute, and that \"it takes a long time.\" I sent her off with the mojito. Not impressed.  Finally, our food came. My carnitas were dry. I slathered them in salsa to make them worth it...Normally, I would have sent them back... but I was famished.  The guacamole was slightly brown, and looked like it had been stored in a ziplock. The beans, had no seasoning. Tasted 'fresh' out of a can, and just thrown onto the plate. The steak for the fajitas had no flavor. No seasoning. Not even salt. The rice was good.  The second time we saw the waitress was her asking us if we needed anything. We said no. And asked for the check. The bus boy came by to clear our plates, and we asked to see a manager.......who walked by us after we had asked for her.  When the manager came by, we told her how disappointed we were in the food, and in the service. We had seen our waitress twice, and the food was poor. She told us that she would have a talk with the server, and \"see\" what she could do....   She offered us free dessert, or dessert to go....we told her that we just wanted to leave. We had already asked for the check, and were STILL waiting on it.  Well, she must of talked to the server alright, because she came back, in a NOTICEABLY rude attitude when she brought our check. Like a toddler about to throw a tantrum because she just got tattled on.  Walking out, she felt the need to give us a dirty look while she said \"thanks,\" and \"goodbye\".   NO THANKS. PASS ON THIS ONE."}
{"text":"The epitome of a very poorly operated restaurant.  Fifteen min. (absolutely no exageration) before we were waited on, and that only happened because we waved down the manager!  Endless series of endless excuses and bs...no offer to take anything off bill or make adjustment.  Really, way too many things wrong....I mean, have you ever been served your tortillas and beans, then waited five mins. for your fajitas??! yikes!"}
{"text":"I was totally surprised this place is good. The food is cheap and quick but very tasty."}
{"text":"Service was meh especially since it wasn't busy for a Friday night. Waitress brought us a pitcher of Pepsi and there were only 2 of us. I'm sure she thought she was being helpful, but it just screamed \"now you will never see me again\"... And we didn't... For a while. Husband got the tamales, he liked them. I got the lettuce wrap tacos. Maybe they were authentic, but I didn't care for the 8 oz of raw onions on my plate making my eyes water... The meat was good though... And good job for using the correct lettuce and not slapping iceberg on my plate. The waitress kept telling us how good our choices were, like mind control or something. All in all, meh... But whatevs. If I want amazing, I can go to Roberto's."}
{"text":"Slow service. Bland food. Very meh.    My ground beef taco seemed to lack any mexican seasoning. Rice tasted like... not much of anything. You get the idea. The idea of the salsa bar was nice. I like getting a choice and there was one in particular I really liked. But that just can't make up for the slow service and bland food."}
{"text":"A bang for your buck. The $9 fajitas with rice beans chips and a margarita was great. Come hungry because it is enough food for two meals!"}
{"text":"I have been to Amigo's numerous times; however, the last 3 times I've taken my family there....bad.  They messed up mine and my wife's order and the service was horribly slow.  Despite there not being many people in the restaurant, it took forever to get refills, have the table cleaned and get my check.  There just doesn't seem to be a sense of urgency or care by the waiting staff.  Not to mention, it much cost extra to get a smile.  Once we got the correct meals, the food was good. It's a shame that one's pretty good restaurant has fallen so far short of adequate."}
{"text":"Fiance and I visited on Sunday, Mother's Day, we were greeted warmly by the hostess and seated almost immediately.  We visit here often as the food is delicious, they have a salsa bar, and within minutes of being seated, warm chips and salsa are brought to your table. Another reason and probably the biggest reason we enjoy coming here is because of a wonderful waitress, Hasmik.  We always ask to be seated in her area because she is cheerful, knowledgeable about the menu and is attentive to her customers. She always brings a pitcher of tea to our table, which I enjoy. My fiance had the Enchiladas Suizas and I had the chicken Fajitas.  Now here I always have a small issue, with this large platter of fajitas, they bring a very small, Trio Bowl of garnishments, guacamole, sour cream and salsa. For the large portion of fajitas, the garnishments are never enough unless you put a very small dot on each taco you make.  On this evening, Room Manager Jerome Martinez was working in the restaurant and he was making his rounds of the tables asking customers about their experience, how was the food, etc.  As he came to our table I decided to ask him why the small garnishment bowl.  He took the time to explain that, corporate and not the restaurant dictated portion control on their dishes.  I did tell him that the size difference was unlike other restaurants but that I was satisfied with his answer.  He did offer to bring me a side order of guacamole which I declined.  While speaking with Hasmik about grandchildren and customer service issues at another local restaurant, Mgr. Martinez, came up and placed a side order of guacamole on our table. Wow! This I did not expect. Well needless to say, we felt that Mgr Martinez, in his own quiet way, went above and beyond to make a customer happier.  We will continue to patronize Amigos, not only for their good food but because of their awesome employees Mgr. Martinez and Hasmik."}
{"text":"Just eat here for the first time and it was excellent! My son got a bean burrito that he just absolutely loved and I got the chicken fajitas which were outstanding. The service is awesome. Janice was our server and she was one of the nicest service we've ever had"}
{"text":"Yuck.  I'm not sure how they can call this Mexican.  The service was crap.  The food was crap.  Stay away!"}
{"text":"Food was good (that's why 4 stars). But they put are party of 7 in the BAR!!  We had minor children with us & they still sat us there.  Security in this casino has a fit if a minor stops to tie their shoes, so very surprised they sat us here.  It was SO SMOKEY!!  I couldn't finish my dinner!!  They're weren't busy & had plenty of tables empty and servers standing around.   The staff was SLOW, at one point our waitress was talking to us & another staff member called her from behind she turned and yelled \"I'm taking here\". REAL PROFESSIONAL!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Service was excellent as well for us showing up 20 mins till close. Ordered a wet burrito and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"We went on a Weds night for our first visit and were very pleasantly surprised. It was fairly busy and the service was outstanding. Chips were warm and salsa was good. I had the steak rancheros and it was fantastic!! Very tender and flavorful.  My wife had the chicken fajitas and it was as good as we have had anywhere. Plenty of chicken, perfectly cooked and tender, not overcooked. We will not hesitate to return here. In fact, I can't wait."}
{"text":"Sadly there isn't a 1/2 star option.  Poor service again... Bland food and children sticking fingers in the salsa bar.., sadly ... We will not be returning.  3 strikes and Your out..,,"}
{"text":"The only reason this establishment has earned one star is the service and even that's a stretch. Greeted with stale chips and bland salsa, I asked for some warm chips. I was told I could visit the salsa bar for more chips. I ordered a taco salad. It was so very bland and the texture was that of baby food. After a few bites, I could not bring myself to eat any more. After my iced tea was replaced with sweet tea, I was done! Check please! Never to return."}
{"text":"A few of my friends went to Amigo's inside Fiesta Henderson on a Wednesday night for dinner.  We went there because we heard they have great Mexican food for relatively inexpensive prices. Both of those things were true.  The food was good. My wife and I split a chicken fajitas and couldn't finish all of the plate. The restaurant serves multiple salsas and hot bean dip with chips before the meal, and we were so hungry, we ended up snacking a little too much on them!  The food was good, the prices (except a $2 side of cheese) were decent, but the service was Terrible (notice the capital \"T\"). We had an older lady serve us and from the moment we came in, our experience was terrible. She asked us if we would want anything else from the kitchen because they had to close down (we were in and out much before closing). She walked away in the middle of a conversation with me and was just generally rude.  I only write this because I have had similar experiences with the waitstaff here before. I know yelp is not a place to rant, but it's a legitimate concern for all of us who are considering a place to eat.   I had such a terrible experience that I will not eat there again. At least not on a Wednesday night."}
{"text":"We are here last night. The food was yummy, I had the steak fajitas, husband had tamales, kids had a cheese quesadilla and ground beef tacos. We enjoyed our meals. The Spanish rice was probably my favorite by far, coming from Southern California, Mexican food is a dime a dozen so I can say the rice is the best I have had in a long time. Salsa bar was fun. We enjoyed the bean dip and array of salsas. So as for the food...Nothing to complain about there. Also cocktails were super yummy too. Now service. Well, it was good when she WAS THERE! She would disappear quite a bit for long periods. And we were getting restless especially with a baby and because of that we had to get our food to go but she gave us everything we needed and more to take it to our room. So my only complaint is we wish she had been around more but as for the whole experience overall was satisfactory!"}
{"text":"This use to be a favorite of ours but the last 2 visits were just awful. Last night ended our relationship with this place. The prices are very high for what they are giving now. The 'salsa' bar no longer has Pico. 4 choices - they were out of Beans. The pot had burnt beans along the sides.  Our waitress Teresa was not attentive at all.  We ordered a Party Appetizer Platter. It looked old, the steak on the nachos was burnt and bland, the food was thrown on the plate- looked like they were mad they had to make it! Not even kidding. I asked where the Quesadilla portion of it was and was told that it didn't come with it. I just rechecked the menu and it Was supposed to be on there. WTH???  My daughter did enjoy her Steak Quesadilla but that was where any good ended.  My husband ordered the a combination plate- 2 items = It was the equivilent to a kids meal.  $65 (after tip) and I feel like I was robbed.  PS- was very sick right after dinner too.  Don't go here, save your money..."}
{"text":"Please do not eat here the food is decent but the service and drinks are Terrible. Don't order the vandalism margarita because they jip you on the alcohol..."}
{"text":"Amigos has a great atmosphere. Great food and margaritas! The service and timing were spectacular!!! Thanks Susan!! Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"It is a rarity in Las Vegas or Henderson to find really good authentic Mexican food at such an affordable price point.    If you want super expensive Mexican food that really isn't all that great, go to Nacho Daddy.  You even have to pay for chips and salsa, really sad.  That said, the chips and salsa (several kinds) are awesome and you are welcome to help yourself at the salsa/chip bar for as much as you want, no limit.  Want hotter salsa, just ask and you will be on fire.  The chimi, tacos, rice and beans, are the best I can find anywhere, including the entire state of Arizona.    Awe the time problem from all those low reviewers.  Everyone is in such a flippin rush.  And again I'll say it, if you're in such a rush, go get some crappy, fake, fast food!  Everyone will appreciate that you aren't in the restaurant.  You're not going to tip anyway, so you deserve fast food.  The staff is great.  However they aren't there to kiss your ass every 5 seconds, as it should be.    Oh, they have their own bar, so if you're into Tequila, yup, they have it."}
{"text":"Don't get the chicken suizas.   The atmosphere was okay. Similar to every other casino.   No one at this restaurant seems to have any time - everyone is running around like a chicken with their heads cut off even though the restaurant is half empty. Our waitress acted like she was on something...she spoke so fast, spoke OVER us, and reminded me of the white rabbit in Alice in Wonderland. Anyway. My husband ordered the fajitas and I ordered the chicken suizas.   Our food came out FAST. Within 5 minutes of ordering...scary. When the fajitas came out I was revolted by the smell, the fajita mix wasn't sizzling...it was burning! Everything that was toward the bottom was burnt, but what was salvageable was actually very good. Now...the chicken suizas....Gross. The chicken was flavorless, the tortillas had like a chemical taste to it, the green sauce was good, the cheese was disgusting and the \"sour cream\" (I put that in quotations because I have never seen grainy sour cream) was absolutely dreadful. The rice was okay but I don't think it was cooked recently. Either that or they had mixed in the old with the new , as there were some pieces that were soft and others that were hard. It was all mexican rice and IT didn't have any flavor. What a shame!  The service was terrible. The only one that seemed to care AT ALL was the \"server assistant\"...some guy that actually looked like he wasn't on something...We received our check TWO MINUTES into our meal and the waitress said, \"I'll be back later to talk about desserts!\" And quickly scurried away before anyone could say anything.   Who the hell gives you the entire bill, without even asking about desserts, IF you're going to offer it!? Doesn't that seem a little counterproductive? Also a WASTE of paper!?? It doesn't make ANY sense.  Okay, whatever...so...we all are finished with our meals and we wait.....and wait.....................and wait. Our server is no where to be seen. We have the money in the check, the \"server's assistant\" has already come and cleared the table...The waitress stops by and I ask her for a cup to take home some salsa, she runs into the kitchen and brings out a cup and completely forgets to grab the check! So we wait some more! I would say 10 minutes later she comes and grabs the checks and quickly runs away again....and we wait...AGAIN!!!! FIFTEEN minutes later, she comes back with change.   She said she couldn't get change cause the bartender had to....um...what!?    Anyway I know this review is really long but here's the jist...  1. Only get the fajitas 2. Stay away from the waitress who looks like she's the road runner 3. Expect to be there for at least an hour and a half."}
{"text":"Wow, tonight was interesting. We've been here a bunch of times and it's kinda always been 'meh' but tonight I liked everything (which is difficult for me).  First the salsa. It wasn't heavy on the cilantro at all, obviously I'm a cilantro hater. I ordered the appetizer chimi - taquitos and they were crispy, flaky and yummy (chicken). Finally the hubby ordered the table side spinach salad, and they have a smoky pepper dressing which was tasty too. Maybe they're starting to turn around? I'll be back hoping it's not a fluke."}
{"text":"Two stars for the service. Our waitress was fantastic which is refreshing to the last time with Janice. The food was so bad. There was no flavor what so ever. Do not waist your money here."}
{"text":"We were hungry and did not want to eat at Denny's or Ala Cart Steak house; so we came here for some Mexican food.  The food was ok and the service was mediocre.  I am from san diego so I expect great things from a Mexican food place such as Amigo's.  So I was not impressed or disappointed but I did walk away with a full belly and way over priced food bill.   Will not return any time soon!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner with friends on Saturday at around 4:30 almost no one was in the resturant, but we had to wait for 20 minutes before our waitress even came over to the table. The hostess was very nice and brought our drinks and made sure we received refills and chips. When the waitress finally came to take our order she acted like she was doing us a favor by waiting on us, took another half hour to get our food which was luke warm, one of my friends went to complain to the manager and the waitress made the remark what did I do this time(so this wasn't the first complaint). The manager on duty didn't seem to care about our concerns or the poor service either. Needless to say we won't be going back, there are to many other resturants in this town who want our service.  Their slogan is we Love Locals, maybe they need to rethink their customer service."}
{"text":"We have been here several times.   Food is about a 4 star.  We like the salsa bar for sure!    My issue is always with the service.   Every single time....the service sucks!   My husband and I are both Chairman status with Station Casinos so you can imagine how much we support Station Properties...but this place is by far the worst service at all the properties.    Maybe it's the management?   But someone needs to get a handle on it!"}
{"text":"This place used to be a lot better than it is now. And the service is SLOW. But it's a cheap meal and there's a lot of it, so it's got that going for it. They have a salsa bar that is pretty awesome. I usually get enchiladas or a burrito. Go with the steak: the chicken is dry. The fajitas are also a good choice."}
{"text":"It was Cinco de Mayo so we had to go out for Mexican food. We went out to Juan's Flaming Fajita's but there was an hour and a half wait so we gave up and headed back home. We decided to try Amigo's in the Fiesta Casino/Hotel. It was a 45 minute wait so we just decided to wait. I gave my daughter $20 to go gamble (Cinco de Mayo is her birthday). She came back with $145!!! The hosts were almost on target with the wait being about 45 minutes. The food was good. I had the Baja Carnita's which were a little dry but my side dish of fried potatoes were pretty good. My dish wasn't bad, but not great. My wife had the grilled corn on the cob. It had cheese and seasoning and was pretty good. My daughter had adobado tacos which were fairly tasty. The service was good considering they were extremely busy. The food came out hot. This is not the best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to but not the worst either. It is one of those places that you go to when you are nearby and need to have dinner. We'll probably go again when we are down there during the dinner hour. Go ahead and eat in Amigo's, you won't regret it, it just isn't gourmet mex."}
{"text":"I feel horrible writing a bad review, but this is really gross.  I forgot what my parents ordered but they hated it. My order wasnt too bad, but then again, I got chicken wings, you cant really mess up on chicken wings.  The service was good they were really nice, but they were really slow.  If I stay at Fiesta again I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"We came in Tuesday night and the food was amazing.  We were a group of four and my hubby had the chimichanga, I had a combination plate with enchilada, taco, and tamal, my daughter had the fiesta nachos and my son had the kids chicken quesadilla. We all loved our food with one exception, the tamal was mainly dough, not enough meat, but overall tasted real good.  I'm still giving them a 5 because overall everything was amazing and if you get a chance try the corona rita, awesome."}
{"text":"This place, argh! We went here about a year ago and were promptly sat. Everything good so far, right? Wrong! The waitress (with an emphasis on the word 'wait'), never showed up after 15 minutes. We got up to leave and the manager stopped us and offered anything on the menu for our troubles.   We stayed, and the manager left a nice taste in our mouths. I wish I could say the same about the food...  Fast forward to today. We figured we'd give this place another try because the manager had been so good to us the last time. We showed up and the hostess took us to our seats and I saw the head of the waitress from last time bobbing around the expo line. I said to my dining companion, \"Christ, I guarantee she is our waitress again.\"   After a few minutes she made her way over and said she'd be right with us. My dining partner and I looked at each other with dread in our eyes. Here we go again!  The waitress is the older gal with the black hair... I want to say she has glasses, but I could be wrong. In my mind her name sounds vaguely ethnic (not that that is an issue, I'm telling you this because should you not heed my warnings and actually come here and are sat in the section of someone who fits this description, RUN!!!!)  She didn't take as long to come back around and take our drink and food orders, which was good. The food showed up and it was kinda gross. The rice tasted over-cooked and the meat was without \"sabor autentíco.\"  We never received a drink refill without asking and waiting for it (she's getting better!).   When it was time for the bill, our waitress disappeared. Why is it that this is the problem with many restaurants in Vegas?! Everything goes kinda well, then the server never brings the check?! I don't get it... We waited a good 10 minutes for the check and by the time everything was finished and the dust was settled, we vowed to never return.   I will keep this solemn vow until I die, I promise that!"}
{"text":"We have gone here quite a few times and service is always good.   The quality of the food is also very good.   A stand out though was Anthony. We had a party of 7 and they put us in the VIP room. The kids loved it and Anthony made our dinner very memorable with his personality. He cracked us up.  I had the Ribeye and shrimp. it was delicious!"}
{"text":"We have been here a number of times and have always felt we got a good meal for our money.  It is not the fanciest place but hey, it's a place to eat.   As others have mentioned you start with freshly made chips and two types of salsa, as well as a bowl of refried beans, a nice combination.  If you want more salsa, just ask.  For me the chips is just a vehicle for the salsa to ride so I always go thru a lot of salsa.   For dinner I usually order the enchilada's but on our last trip we all got the all you can eat tacos for $6.99.  What a deal.  You have a choice of beef, chicken or fish.  I started with chicken thinking they would be fairly small so I could try the others.  But by the time I got done with my first plate (and all the chips and salsa) I was already almost full.  But being a huge fan of fish tacos I just had to try some.  They brought them out and they were a very decent size piece of fish.  The garnish was just about right and the sauce was tasty.  Although for me I think they could have put a bit more sauce on the taco.  Dang, \"where's the beef?\"  I never did get to the beef taco. Next time we go I think I will ask for a variety of tacos on the first run to make sure I have room to sample them all.  My only complaint: the Margaritas were a bit on the spendy side.  You can have dinner here for under $10 but $10 to $15 is more the norm depending on your choice of beverage."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I've eaten here. The first time I came here I had the pick 2 combo whch was enchiladas.  the 2nd time I was here was on New Years Day after filling up on $1 beer in the sports book.  I dont remember what my bf ordered but I went with Beef Fajitas. The plate came out sizzling hot and smelled very good. I dont really eat tortillas but it came with a side plate of rice and beans. the beans are kinda runny and the rice is very much like what you would get out of the box of rice-a -roni. Well I love san francisco as much as the next person but this was not my fave rice but after a few beers it wasnt too bad.  The fajitas were very small portioned. I know my bf took several stabs at my food but compared with other places I think I'd rather order something else next time. I guess I'm just so used to taking a box home to go- and this time .. there was no box to pack and it was rather greasy.   Better yet to go to Los compadres on Trop and order some fajita meat to cook up or order some of their ready made food."}
{"text":"I had to update this review.  I go to this place all the time and the past 6 or 7 times the service has been much better.  'Tiny' is probably the best server here.  He's funny, personable, and he gets the job done.  The food is always consistent and now they've added a salsa bar.  Their chicken or beef flauta is great!  I love to go to new places but when I want mexican food, I want to go somewhere that I know is gonna be good.  Other than Carlito's Burritos, this is the spot for me."}
{"text":"Not impressed. The restaurant itself is super super super nice, and the chips are really good. But I was not impressed with my food. I had a chicken quesadilla and it was very dry. And my boyfriend's food was very Bland also. The service was excellent though, we had a really really great waitress."}
{"text":"Inside the Fiesta Henderson. There is a good size bar that you can order from too. Chips and salsa bar is awesome, service was good.I Ordered the chicken enchilada, chili relleno, and mini shredded beef burrito. The Enchilada was excellent as well as the chili relleno which had sauteed onions and peppers on top. BF had the carne asada burrito and may have found one of his favorites . Over all this is our new favorite Mexican Restaurant. Just beware if your order the Sangria Pitcher, $36"}
{"text":"Good local spot. Margaritas are too sweet. Poor waitress had the whole floor all to herself. I witnessed some people waiting behind me that left cause they were waiting so long for someone to take their order. They have a salsa bar in the back with some descent salsa. In would def come back for the tortilla soup. We ordered enchiladas. The chicken was tasty. Decor is cute with overhead hanging lights. This is not a crazy party spot or anything. Prob wouldn't come with a group cause of slow service."}
{"text":"Now if you knew me well, you would know that I'm not the biggest fan of Mexican food.  I actually consider this food one of my least favorite in the world.  Once in a while, though, I can appreciate the occasion guacamole, quesadilla and of course, NACHOS, especially when there's a beer in my hand.  Today, we came to Amigo's after a fun bingo session at the Fiesta.  All of these festivities was to celebrate our coworker's birthday.    When you arrive in this area, it gets a little confusing.  The one opening could be Amigo's restaurant, or the bar area, or even Fuego Steakhouse in the back.  It got confusing and would help if we were greeted, however, we weren't.  The 2 hostess at the stand waited till we said something before they helped us out.  We decided to sit at the bar so we could have a beer and a shot.  The overall place is dim and open, which overlooks the entire Fiesta casino floor.  This casino is smokey and run down, so it's hard to really enjoy the view and atmosphere.    I don't know our server, however he was super slow.  It took him a long time to come to our table to drink us.  Plus he started off by taking half the table's drink order until I called him back as he walked away.  We got the bud light draft and jagger shot for a total of $5.  For the menu items, we decided to feed our table of 10 an array of appetizers.  For kicks, we told our server to bring one of each of every appetizer they had.  BIG MISTAKE if you're looking to have a light appetizer session and drinks.    Let's start with table side guacamole for $8.99.  Our server said he was going to make half of the guac in the back and finish it off by the table which seemed sketchy but we went with it.  The guacamole actually tasted good!  Avocado, tomatoes, serrano chiles, red onions, cilantro, lime and homemade chips.  Lots of flavor and well balanced.  Next we had the Cholula Chicken wings for $7.99.  Hotter than normal hot wings.  Too tangy and sour for me, but your average chicken wing.  Next was the Cantina Nachos for $8.99.  These nachos had grilled chicken, refried beans, oaxacan and monterey jack cheese, tomatoes, olives, green onions and jalapenos.  It would be good if the cheese wasn't harder than normal.  The chips stuck together, so when you tried to grab one chip, you grab the entire bowl.  Next were the Camarones Del Cabo, or the bacon wrapped shrimp for $9.99.  This dish has monterey jack cheese and honey mustard sauce.  Really good for a change!  The next dish was Lettuce Wrap Tacos for $7.49.  Lettuce cups accompanied with an ala cart filled with grilled chicken, avocados, tomatoes, red bell peppers, sliced jalapeños, oaxacan and monterey jack cheese with a trio of salsas.  Last appetizer were the chimitaquitos for $7.49.  Just a fancy way of saying quesadilla if you ask me.  That's what it was.  Tortillas stuffed with green chile chicken or seasoned beef served with sour cream, guacamole and pico de gallo.  As if we didn't have enough food, our server brought both the chicken and beef.  Just your average quesadilla, nothing special.    I will give it up.  We had a lot of food and it was super filling.  My thoughts were, thank goodness the meal was expensed through work.  I wouldn't be prone to shell up the money if I had the choice, but it was a good meal for the venue and situation.  Please don't take my word for it, go check it out and review it for yourself."}
{"text":"TRY THE CHILE CON QUESO!!! Loved the 8 different types of salsas to choose from.   I was seated right away. Chips were fresh. Carlos was attentive and hardworking. Fast food delivery. Good food. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Attended a Beer pairing dinner! All of the food and service were excellent"}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday evening and ordered  1. 2 item: Beef enchilada and chicken tamale, 11.99 2. Fiesta carne asada burrito, 11.99 for $16 (Used a Advisor BOGO entree coupon)   - In Fiesta Henderson. Next to Fuego.  - Free chips and salsa bar. Also has refried beans.  - Quick service. Hot plate. No hassle.  - Left the pitcher of water for us. Bonus - 2 item came with a salad. Basic.  - Tasty tamale! Lots of flavor. Recommend.  - Lots of carne asada in wet burrito. flavorful.   - Left overs. Enough for the next dinner meal.  - Get chips to-go! yay.  - Compared to other cantinas around the area; Chevy's, Jaliscos, Coyotes, I feel that this is the best in terms of value with the use of coupons."}
{"text":"Thinking of cheap Americanized Mexican food and cheap cocktails.... Come here. Our server was awesome, the food was prompt and delicious.  There was a salsa bar and unlimited chips to go with it.  They gave us an extra margarita on accident!!!! I've been looking at the other reviews for this place and I have to say... I thought I was judgemental!!! All I want is a server who doesn't hover but knows when to refill my glass, a friendly smile, good food, good cocktails. The prices can't be beat and my server... I think his name was Luis but I'm not sure... Always had my glass refilled.  There's nothing worse than an empty glass and a thirsty patron."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  Not only do you get chips and salsa, you get re-fried beans when the chips come out.  Plates are fair priced and the specials of the month are always a nice deal.  I have never had a problem with the service, food is always hot and fresh and tasty.  I would recommend for sure and if you play some, your dinner could be free (or the hundreds of dollars  you lost to the one armed bandits!!!)"}
{"text":"Tl;dr-Absolutely terrible. Bland. 2 hours of waiting. Crusted over salsa bar. Dry meat. Soggy dead salad. Stale chips. Go to Roberto's instead.   How can this hold up to casino standards? Obviously the station casinos are not 5 star joints, but the food and service received tonight barely should reach 1 star.  Seated and waited for server. Waited for server. Waited and waited for server. Called one over ourselves, who happened to be our server, who saw us, but never came over to us on his own. He seemed discouraged we didn't want a Margarita he was trying to push. Ordered 2 waters. Waited and waited for those.  Salsa bar had bottom of chips available. Mostly stale crumbs. Salsas and beans developed a nice crust over top. There were like 3 ramekins left for use to put salsas in. I used them all, and asked for more. They said they'd bring some out. Got tired of waiting. Just took what I had. Saw a few others go up, ask for more. Still nothing. The whole time we ate, still never replaced. People started just reusing their old ones. Pretty gross. More waiting. Finally ordered. 2 orders of combo platter-chile relleno and pork tamale. Waited and waited and waited for food. Never got refills on waters. Server nowhere to be seen. Salad came. This should have been our cue to leave. Rubbery, clear cucumber slices. gritty, mushy tomatoes. Wilted, browning, floppy lettuce. Didnt eat. Food finally came. ridiculously small chile. Greasy, thin breading, hardly any cheese filling. Watery green pepper and onion sauce on top. Tamale nice sized, pork extremely dry inside. Nice amout, but hardly edible. Dry masa, barely any sauce on top. Barely ate. Waited for server to ask for check. Waited. Waited. Still no refills, never cleared salad plates, never checked on us, nothing. Asked another server to get our check. Needless to say-we won't be back. Used to be much better here. Don't know what happened to it."}
{"text":"Second visit here. First time, the service was extremely horrible and the waitress got the order wrong..not once...not twice...but 3 times. Some old lady, very inattentive and rude. Management had so many complaints they comped the whole restaurant.  Tonights visit...much better, service was alot better. 2 of us got the fajitas, which were good, vegetables could have been seared a touch longer. Beverages stayed full, but the margaritas were a touch watered down & pricey. The other party ordered a combo plate and it was devoured quickly. I felt that the food was a little bland (but better bland then overpower it) and a little salt was needed.  They also have the $1 2-spot win a $15 coupon keno games there. We played $30 worth and ended up winning $60 dollars in coupons which almost covered the cost of the meal, so that was a great investment. Plus the keno runner tonight was very friendly too (but probably bored and she said it was extremely slow for her).  Overall, this visit was a 3 star, its an average run-of-the-mill mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Place has changed since I was last here, and not for the better. I could have saved a few bucks by going to Roberto's.  Carne Asada Burrito was just okay. Black beans were not very warm and Mexican rice a bit bland."}
{"text":"I am not sure why I keep going back to Amigo's.  There much better options for Mexican food locally. I am always disappointed by the food, the service, or both.  My most recent visit, we were sat quickly in a booth and our server approached us immediately. Unfortunately, that was the last we saw of her.  It wasn't that busy, but she never checked on us and seemed overwhelmed.  The chips and salsa and bean dip are the best part of any meal here.  They also have a complimentary salsa bar, and everything is pretty fresh and delicious there. I had the spinach enchiladas with black beans and rice.  The enchilada was supposed to have spinach, cheese and mushrooms.  There was a whole lot of spinach and I actually didn't see any cheese or mushrooms (an enchilada without cheese?!).  The beans and rice didn't seem fresh either.  I was really disappointed, especially after we had to hunt down our waitress to pay our bill."}
{"text":"Had the Nachos and they were soo good! Such friendly staff (very accommodating) and the tamales looks and smelled so good!! I don't normally stay here but I did this time and ate here.. No lie, i would drive there again if i have the chance!"}
{"text":"We sat there for 15_20 minutes at a dirty table despite our asking several times for service. Finally, as we were getting up to leave a waitress came over. She pretty much blamed us for not sitting in a more convenient area. We left."}
{"text":"Thank you YELP for the coupon.  When I checked in on yelp we got a coupon for shrimp and crab enchiladas.  They were great.  The street corn is a must!  I will be back for that alone!!"}
{"text":"Worst service I've had in my life!!! Avoid this restaurant!!! After 2 mins of sitting the waitress comes to take our order. And after notifying her I needed more time she disappeared for 20 mins before coming back. I didn't see her for the rest of the night, but the table next to me got to see her 4 times! Another waiter brought out the food. Which was completely wrong and ice cold. Asked for the manager and waited another 15 mins before he decided he got around to my table. All in all we just got up and left. I will never return to this horrendous restaurant."}
