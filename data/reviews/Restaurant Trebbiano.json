{"text":"Went for my girlfriend's birthday supper. Just awful. Everything was much too salty, to the point where we actually returned her plate (which we never do). The chef had actually left the restaurant even though it wasn't even 8 PM. The serving staff were nice and didn't charge us her meal, but still, I don't see us ever going back."}
{"text":"Visiting from Connecticut.  Excellent fresh food exquisitely prepared, casual atmosphere, friendly staff.  What more could we ask for?  Delicious dessert, of course, and a fine house wine (we had the white)."}
{"text":"Very good.  Had the stuffed medallions a la gigi which was very good.  For dessert had the cheesecake with bacon has seen on previous reviews and have to say it was very good!!!!  My dinner guest had the linguine with seafood, wow what a dish and it was an excellent dish!  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Nous avions réservé pour six personnes pour l'heure du lunch. Les moules étaient à l'honneur et ceux qui les ont choisies semblaient les apprécier. Petite salade servie avec le menu du jour assez ordinaire. Par contre, le potage à la patate douce était délicieux. J'ai pris les médaillons à la Gigi, beaucoup trop de champignons mais tout de même bons. J'ai opté pour un verre de Chardonnay Moustache (importation privée) après avoir été conseillé par le serveur... Un peu déçue, il était plutôt ordinaire côté rondeur et que dire du prix 12 $ le verre ! Il ne valait certainement pas ce prix-là. Une attention devrait être portée au nettoyage des salles de toilette car cette journée-là, du côté des femmes, la saleté était omniprésente...."}
{"text":"Trebbiano had excellent reviews on TripAdvisor so we decided to give it a whirl.  Making a reservation was simple and the person on the line spoke English which was a help. When we arrived we were met by Bruno who was extremely effusive and gregarious as he led us to our seats. We had no idea what he was saying but the other patrons nodded and smiled and we simply hoped he wasn't calling us names behind our backs. His charm was infectious and we couldn't help but smile with him. 

The wine list was lacking in depth and in any wines that had true character but I understand the Canadian palette to be expectant of wines that are fruity and flowery.  I prefer wines with a bit more grit and dirt...the closest of which was a Gabbiano Chianti Classico Reserva...while there were some Puglian and Sardinian wines the majority were overly fruit forward.

Because I was having a sausage appetizer I selected a glass of the Ruffino Orvietto and we had a perfectly acceptable d'Abruzzo with our main course as it went with nearly everything and was harmless. 

My sausage came slightly overcooked but still delicious on a bed of lightly dressed arugula. The light and fresh Orvietto cut the salt and fat of the sausage perfectly.  All of our mains (all primi's) were well executed but one in our party thought the risotto was a bit too large of a portion. My Carbonara was deliciously salty and creamy. 

Dessert was taken to a whole new level with a caramel cheesecake covered in bacon. Yes bacon. Simply awesome. And when completed with a simple Sambucca the meal was a rousing success.

When on the South shore of Montreal be sure to seek out Trebbiano."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a very nice little restaurant with classy decor. Although it was slightly cramped when it got busy.

FOOD: Food was good. I was kind of disappointed with their meal... I had their gnocchi (which didn't fill me up at all, disappointing especially knowing how heavy gnocchi should be). The menu itself was pretty short as well... Overall, the meals were decent. I will not be coming back here unfortunately.

PRICE: Overpriced meals unfortunately. It's supposed to be a higher end restaurant but the meals they served didn't really match the description and reputation of the restaurant.

SERVICE: The staff were very friendly. They did what they had to do and were quite nice! (Even if they messed up one of our orders)"}
