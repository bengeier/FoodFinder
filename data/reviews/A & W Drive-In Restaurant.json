{"text":"What can I say. Great coney dogs, and awesome root beer. Service is always fast and the girls are always nice. Prices are fair but bummer on no debit cards. Hit the ATM for a little folding money before stopping by, but its worth it."}
{"text":"Shame on all you crappy people giving low scores. These are kids waiting on the cars!! You can't screw up a hot dog and cheese curds. I bet you are the same ones who try and rationalize your poor tipping habits"}
{"text":"We live in Uniontown/Hartville area so this is a bit of a drive for us, but we try to go a few times a year, they have the absolute BEST root beer anywhere around, and the hotdogs are delicious. The girls who work here, work their butts off, it's always busy and some people are so rude, but they still keep a friendly face and try to accommodate you as best as possible, so shout out to you guys going to school, and working a busy summer night here after! There is literally something for everyone here, it has that \"old school diner\" feel, try it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My husband arrived home on Friday night after a long, hot day at work.  He looked sad and I started to feel bad that I hadn't cooked him dinner (I thought we'd get take-out).  He reminded me that we had mentioned going to A&W on Tallmadge Circle earlier in the week.  I HAD forgotten, but I couldn't wait to get there!

I grew up in the Firestone Park area of Akron, Ohio.  Akron was inundated with amazing curb-serviced/car-hopped drive-ins that sold any manner of sandwiches, burgers, fried food, floats and shakes!  One of my happiest memories from high school was getting car-side from the A&W restaurant on Waterloo Road.  30 years later I can still have the same experience on Tallmadge Circle!!

The sun was beginning to set when we pulled into an empty parking space.  The place was bustling with patrons and car-hops.  Though busy, our waitress bopped over and gave us menus.  I had a few questions about the menu which she answered like a pro!  The kids running their butts off were obviously high school kids making money in the last days of late summer.

We listened to the beginning of the Indians game while waiting for our cheeseburger, crinkle-cut french fries, coney dogs and root beers.  Our take-home dinner was delivered to us in a white box (which fit perfectly on my lap for the ride home).  We didn't spill anything.

We ate dinner on TV trays watching the baseball game that night.  We snapped open red and white packets of salt and sprinkled them on our crinkle-cut fries, my husband remarked, \"you drank all of your root beer before we got home!\"  We scooped up the tiny bits of onion that scattered from the tops of our foot-long coneys as if we were mining for gold.  

My cheeseburger was encompassed by a sesame-seeded chewy, soft bun - appointed with mustard, ketchup, pickle, and a smattering of onions - the cut of which I cannot re-enact in my own kitchen!

Time has paused at A&W Root Beer Stand.  Life is happy here!"}
{"text":"Ok....so Imma be honest here, I didn't get root beer. I know....I know....the place is known for the root beer floats it has. But, I don't like root beer. I heard your gasp, chill out dude. Not everyone can be as cool as you. Although, I am pretty close!

I love old school drive in eateries. They make my heart smile and transport me back to the days when I was just a speck in the mind of the universe (I am only 35 ok?) The nostalgia is always palpable and attracts me to come in and taste. I have lived in Akron a few years and have passed this place dozens of times. Wa super hungry so I decided to give it a shot! 

1) Service was very good. The nice girl we had waiting on us was prompt and courteous. The food was made and served in a flash and I never had to flag anyone down. That right there is worth it's weight in coney sauce!

2) Plenty of parking spaces. Yay A&W!

3) The food was just meh...I could take it or leave it. Here is what we ordered:

A) 2 Coney dogs loaded up: The coney sauce was actually really good. The best part of the entire dog I would say. It was thick but not chunky and nice and flavorful. The hot dogs are warmed in water. EWWWW A long white strip of meat DOES NOT look appealing. Not to mention, it adds no flavor. For all things that are righteous and holy....throw that thing on the grill man! The cheese sauce is typical and the diced onions were scarce and not flavorful.

B) 1 small french fry: I hate....lemme repeat HATE crinkle cut fries. I know many people who love them, but not this guy! If I would have known, I wouldn't have ordered them. I can say though that they were cooked well and were hot and crispy. So, for those that like crinkle cut fries, you would enjoy!

C) Coleslaw side: Ok, this is your typical, run of the mill fast food coleslaw. Probably pre made in a bucket. Not horrible but nothing to write home to mom about. Plus, they give you like 4 tablespoons....just a few bites. No thanks.

All of this cost me $17 including tip. 2 hot dogs, coleslaw and a small fry. Honestly, I felt ripped off. The bad definitely out weighed the good here. I will be taking this one off my frequent flier list!"}
{"text":"The root beer and root beer floats were great.  Classic American drive-in hot dogs and burgers...not the best, but not the worst that I've tasted. I ordered the Coney dog, fries, and a root beer float.  I expected the Coney sauce the have more flavor and substance, which it did not.  Fries were crinkle-cut and under salted, but they did give me a salt pack to add to the fries.  Staff was pleasant and service was fast."}
{"text":"The root beer is classic here. Service is always really fast and servers are always very friendly however, whenever we call in orders the person who answers the phone is not friendly at all. He actually sounds pained to be talking to you on the phone. So if your coming here to park and ear no doubt you'll be fine....but be prepared to be taken aback by abruptness of the other person on the end of the line  if you phone in an order"}
{"text":"A throwback to the days of roller rinks, car hops and root beer.

This old fashioned drive up root beer stand takes you back.  Love the nostalgic feeling I get when I come here. An Akron tradition for sure. Situated at the Tallmadge circle, it is easily accessible from Akron, Cuyahoga Falls and Tallmadge.

The car hop will come to the car to take your order once you turn your headlights on. The menu is small but satisfactory. The prices are cheap cheap. 

Don't forget to buy a souvenir mug or growler to document your visit.

The food is ok. Nothing special or exciting but it's more about the experience. So grab a dog, a root beer float and enjoy it!"}
