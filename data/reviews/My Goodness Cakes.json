{"text":"I ordered a birthday cake for my son's first birthday and was beyond thrilled with their cake. The adorable turtle I'd seen on their website was just as cute in person as it was online. The cake was flavorful, light, and delicious-- the hit of the whole party. Considerately, the price even included a personal \"smash cake\" for the birthday boy. I cannot recommend this bakery high enough!"}
{"text":"I went to an open house at a wedding venue and this vendor was there with their display. First off the cup cakes are not good. I was able to try a few different flavors and they all tasted the same. They had no flavor and they tasted more like store bought. The one thing that really made me mad was the guy (I am guessing the owner) told my daughter not to touch his fake cake displays. After we walked off he went over checking his fake cakes as if my daughter had destroyed them, she barley even touched them. I won't be using this vendor nor do I recommend it."}
{"text":"The nicest owner, friendliest service and most delicious cupcakes and muffins! I completely recommend this charming spot."}
{"text":"Perfection, delicious, beautiful, and professional are the words to describe Brian's cakes. Brain made the cake for my wedding and wedding shower. They were amazing!  I would recommend him over and over again. Thank you Brian for your all of your hard work!!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to give this review but the gluten free cake I ordered for my mom's 75th birthday was horrible.  It was the dryest cake I have ever eaten.  I was embarrassed that the cake had actually been served to everyone and I wasn't able to taste in time so that they could have ordered another dessert."}
{"text":"Brian did a fabulous job from the initial cake tasting to delivery of our wedding cake. Delicious and beautiful!"}
{"text":"Brian did our wedding cake, it was perfect and tasted delicious!"}
{"text":"I stopped in to get cupcakes on our anniversary as is our tradition.  I was in the area and googling all the bake shops nearby and some were closed and some were appointment only, blah, blah, blah.  It was hot (106) and I didn't want to drive too far.  I called My Goodness Cakes to see 1. if they were open and 2. how late they were open and the very friendly gentleman said they were open for another 45 min.  I rushed over and stepped inside and found the shop clean and simple and appealing.  Being as it was almost closing time, there were not too many cupcakes but still, a fair selection.  I hemmed and hawed and settled on the lemon, the honey chai (their bestseller) and a vanilla cream with choc frosting.  I was out the door, mission accomplished.  Fast forward to cupcake eating time- I knew the cupcakes had been there all day, so I figured they would be dry as I have often found to be the case- I was pleasantly surprised at how moist and tasty the cake portions were.  The frosting was sweet but not that disgusting cloying sweet that makes your tongue icky and it was soft and not dried out firm dollops.  The lemon was packed with lemony goodness and tasted fresh not like bottled up lemon juice, the chai was light and just spicy enough and the vanilla/choc frosted was just enough of each taste without either one overpowering the other.  The cupcakes were all three annihilated in short order.  Next time I need cupcakes, I know where to go."}
{"text":"Stopped by My Goodness Cakes on a trip to Phoenix. I ordered the red velvet cupcake and was quite disappointed. Cake was dry and flavorless and the icing had a funny taste- kind of like plastic. Cupcakes also didn't taste fresh at all. Owner was very friendly and pleasant!"}
{"text":"At the risk of sounding repetitive, Brian does a fantastic job of creating delicious, creative cakes.  I trusted reviews here and didn't even sample ahead of time.  I picked a design from his website (so many to choose from) and he helped suggest flavors.  The cake is unbelievably moist, in fact- we made a mess of cutting because it's such a contrast to the thicker fondant.   If you purchase I recommend get a professional or a good cake knife to cut it!"}
{"text":"Brian was GREAT. He is very quick to respond to e-mails and we were able to set up a tasting right away. His cakes are wonderful! Not only delicious and reasonably priced, but our wedding cake was beautiful, too, and exactly as I had it pictured in my head. I also surprised my husband with a groom's cake. - He is a drummer, so I took a photo of his favorite drum, e-mailed  it to Brian, and he replicated it. I was able to pay him by credit card over the phone, and it was all done quick and easy so that my husband never suspected a thing. My husband cried when he saw what we had done."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a much needed coffee on a cold day. I was headed for the National Memorial Cemetery which is right up the road. The decor is super cute and the delightful smell of baked goods fills the room! I had a regular cappuccino. The service was friendly and the coffee was great. Well done."}
{"text":"Awesome cake, great flavor and quality, tasted just as good as it did in the tasting.  It was a beautiful cake and the frosting was amazing.  He was timely, organized, delivered on time and very on top of things.  He is very helpful in the selection process and patient with indecisive brides.  Very happy to do business with him and would go back for other special occasions.  I got so many compliments on the look and taste of my wedding cake."}
{"text":"I am definately giving them 5 stars!!! I ordered a cake for my friend for her 30th Birthday. Not only Brian went out of his way to make my cake in a short amount of notice but he worked with me on the design. It came out amazing, the cake was not only beautifull but very delicious. I am ordering another cake from him this weekend for a another friend of mine for her baby shower. I have no doubt that it will be gorgeous and I cant wait to work with this bakery for my future events. See the picture of my gorgeous cake.... many compliments were given that night!!! This place is definately my new bakery!!! Thank you guys, and I would give you 10 stars if it was available!!!"}
{"text":"First off as a small business owner I love to support small businesses and this place was great. Their customer service is on point! And the cup cakes were great as well. We will for sure be back"}
{"text":"I had a perfect experience ordering cupcakes for my daughters bridal shower.  Brian displayed excellent customer service, the sunflower cupcakes were designed beautifully and they tasted amazing!  Will definitely tell everyone I know to use Brian for all of their special events!"}
{"text":"BEWARE. Absolutely RUINED my daughter's birthday party. I carefully ordered this cake, giving details that I needed it to be a THREE TIER CAKE - and the man I spoke with said it would be an extra charge for a third tier, I said I didn't care, this was a very important party and the cake was to be the centerpiece. He upped the price to include the third tier and I paid for it in advance. Come day of the party, we show up at the bakery to find A ONE LEVEL CAKE. UGLY, SAD, and broke my little girl's heart. All I got from the girl working there was, \"Oh, well, I will let my manager know you weren't happy with it.\" I explained the problem and she just stared at me. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE ONE LEVEL CAKE WHEN I ORDERED A THREE TIER CAKE AND PAID BIG MONEY FOR IT. Thank you \"My Goodness Cakes\" for destroying our centerpiece and highlight of the party and destroying the day and the memory. DO NOT TRUST THIS PLACE. DISGUSTING!"}
{"text":"Looked this place up and decided to go here since I was near the area anyway. I got two (delicious) cupcakes, cause I was wanting something to cheer me up after an upsetting day. White vanilla and chai. Never had chai cake before but this was good. They're a good local bakery that I should give my support to."}
{"text":"Brian at My Goodness Cakes is a superstar!!!!   My fiance and I had just started looking for a bakery to do our wedding cake when we stopped in to My Goodness Cakes.   We were so impressed with our first meeting with Brian that we decided immediately we wanted him to do our cake - even before the tasting!  Once we did the tasting, we were completely hooked!   His cakes are so light and airy - but PACKED with delicious flavor!!!   The frostings are beyond amazing, too!  He listened to what we wanted for our cake and even helped us pick out a gluten-free birthday surprise for a few of our wedding guests whose birthdays fell on the same day.  The day of the wedding, he delivered the cake perfectly on time and it was EXACTLY what we had asked for!    We could not have been more happy!   And... our guests RAVED about the flavors... especially the chai tea flavored cake with the honey-cinnamon frosting!!!     I was so pleased with everything that I ordered 3 dozen cupcakes for our office Christmas party... and those, too, were phenomenal!     I will be ordering all of my cakes from Brian from now on!!"}
{"text":"Love the lemon cupcakes! Unfortunately I'm sure they are addicting cuz I cant stop eating them. Great owner...always super pleasant. Every flavor you could want!"}
{"text":"This is my third time frequenting this nice little shop. The owner is so nice and friendly, and the cakes on display are very professional and creative! The Yelp Check-In deal brought me in; I wanted a cupcake! And I've now enjoyed some great iced beverages, a few cupcakes and muffins, and great conversation. I'd recommend their muffins for a quick breakfast for sure. :)"}
{"text":"Found this place accidentally while turning around in parking lot to get to another coffee shop... what a FIND!   Great coffee, nice people, comfortable atmosphere... got a cupcake to go - let me try a bite... OMG so delish!!!!  Would write more, but gotta get back to my cupcake! ;-)  Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Every cake has been amazing. Super moist and great flavors, not just the same old thing you get from a mass produced place.  Bring your imagination cause if you can dream it up he can do it!!!!!  You should also visit for coffee.  They have a coffee bar with freshly made muffins, cupcakes, cookies and specialty coffee drinks.  A great place to get together with friends, lots of room for groups or business meetings."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! The owner greets you as you walk in and is very attentive. On top of the great customer service, the muffins and cupcakes are delicious. Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"A beautiful cake was made for my daughter's 3rd birthday on short notice! Thanks for making such a wonderful and yummy cake!"}
{"text":"Best cakes! Brian created an amazing grooms cake for my son. It was amazing... people raved about the cake."}
{"text":"I called Brian to place a last minute cupcake request for our Company's morning event.  He went out of his way to fulfill our order and deliver it to our work place the next morning.  We received great feedback on how good the cupcakes where and the variety of flavors really pleased everyone.  I definitely recommend My Goodness Cakes, not only for personal consumption, but for business functions as well.  Than you!!!"}
{"text":"I had a cake made for my mom's 75th. birthday, and it looked great and tasted even better !  I would definitely recommend My Goodness Cakes to anyone that is looking for a unique and great quality cake . I can't recommend them highly enough."}
{"text":"It always irks me when I show up at 5:45 when a business is posted to be open until 6:00 and they are closed"}
{"text":"The man that runs the place is amazing and genuinely honest. My Fiancé and I are planning our wedding and obviously needing a cake. First off, the peanut butter cupcake/cake is a blessing from God himself and the lemon cake is the holy grail. Look all I'm trying to say is this place is dope and if you're not coming here to buy your wedding cake or just any cake regardless of occasion then let me be the first to tell you....You're doing it wrong."}
{"text":"I ordered my wedding cake from here and I absolutely loved it. They were so helpful and nice and brought the cake right on time and all of our guests absolutely LOVED it! Thank you again!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. So cute inside and has the best cupcakes and muffins I've ever tasted. Great place to meet friends for coffee and dessert."}
{"text":"Ahhhhh. Let's put it this way... Brian created an amazing white, fondant, 3-tier cake for my wedding. As tradition has it, my new husband and I were given the top tier of our cake to be eaten on our one year anniversary. We got married 3 months ago, and half of this top tier is already gone because we CANNOT STOP OURSELVES! It is so delicious. I believe the top and bottom tier were butter rum. The middle and a sheet cake were chai. And then we had one chocolate chocolate sheet cake. This was the perfect amount for our 200-guest wedding. I love these cakes!!"}
{"text":"Brian did an amazing job designing and baking our wedding cake. It was so delicious, everyone loved it! He was a joy to work with during the process and listened to all of our ideas and helped us make it even better. He also makes yummy cupcakes and I know we will be regular customers from now on. Thanks for making our wedding so special!"}
{"text":"With relative short notice Brian, the owner of My Goodness Cakes made a custom design three tier cake for our wedding. The cake was delivered with a box for the top tier to be eaten for our first anniversary. We had a travel theme for our wedding and the cake was designed with that theme in mind. As a side note, I was a bit skeptical about the chai flavored cake but it was so good and the most popular with our guests. Will highly recommend My Goodness Cakes!"}
{"text":"Tasted several different cupcakes before placing an order for a birthday cake.....I NEVER like anyone's cakes and I LOVED every single one at My Goodness Cakes :) Top-notch, professional and friendly service. I look forward to seeing (and eating!) the cake he creates for us!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time yesterday.  Cute store, lovely cakes on display.  The man working behind the counter makes the cakes and does a great job.    Ordered my family 2 muffins and 2 cupcakes.  I ate the red velvet cupcake which was pretty good.  I would have loved it more with a cream cheese frosting.    Cute store, love checking out small businesses!"}
{"text":"We have had three cakes made here. Our wedding cake, my sons medical school graduation and now sons engagement party cake. All three times were positive experiences for us. Cakes are beautiful and taste excellent and Brian's  customer service is great. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"With so many cake choices and bakeries, we weren't quite sure how to select one for our wedding cake.  Friends sent us to Brian at My Goodness Cakes and it was a wonderful experience.  Brian uses vegan fondant.  (I'm a vegetarian and I was concerned that would be an issue.)  We enjoyed our tasting and had no difficulty choosing our tier flavors and fillings.  Staff at the reception site also told us how nice they were upon delivery.  Received many compliments from our guests.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I just ordered 80 cupcakes from My Goodness Cakes for my husband's surprise 60th birthday party.  They were delicious!  They were SO fresh and moist and the frosting iwas incredible.  Everyone loved them!  I have to say that they were WAY more affordable than anywhere else too. The owner was so nice and helpful.   I will definitely be ordering from them again for any cakes or cupcakes I need again in the future.  Highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best iced chai tea latte and cupcakes!! The most creative and gorgeous looking cakes as well!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a graduation cake and man, they sure delivered! Was not disappointed one bit! Most importantly, the cake tastes amazing! I am not a cake person but the confetti cake was very very good! The design was very clean-cut and amazing. Very well done 10/10."}
{"text":"Brian made our wedding cake this past March.  Not only was it gorgeous and exactly what we asked for, but it was also delicious.  All of our guests complimented how amazing it tasted, and even in our pictures it looks scrumptious!    If you are looking for an honest, reasonably priced baker to help make your wedding (or baby shower or any other special occasion) that much more memorable, you really need to contact Brian.  He is patient, friendly, and incredibly talented - he's very open to customization to help make your cake unique.  You won't be disappointed :)!"}
{"text":"Great place to work and have a cup of coffee. Quiet! Nice owners. Delicious cakes and cupcakes. Will be back! Nice neighborhood place!!"}
{"text":"Free wi-fi :) tasty cupcakes & good coffee. Cute shop - booths, tables & a couch. They do custom cakes to order too.  I think my tip ^ above pretty well sums it up!  I like the energy/feel of this shop. It's not cramped and there is a nice variety of seating. There's a happy mix of cupcake flavors - I think at least twelve or so (I'll go back soon & verify ;)   There are tiered cakes on display and they are beautifully decorated. The man at the counter was friendly and professional. I wouldn't hesitate to order a specialty cake from this bakery. And ATTENTION BRIDES!: the store is right next to a large wedding shop - so it's a one-stop-shop.   I'm something of a cupcake snob (but I won't get to far into that since it involves unfair comparisons!)  What I will state is that although this wasn't the \"best cupcake in the world to me,\" it was very enjoyable - not greasy, very tasty (& \"real\" tasting frosting), & light. I'll definitely pop back in, bring my laptop & will enjoy a sweet treat."}
{"text":"We normally order from caketini in San tan mall.  But we were discouraged on our last order.  They charged for everything and the cake was small so we decided to cancel the cake order and find a new baker.  We visited my goodness cakes and they were extremely helpful and price was very reasonable a he was excited about our cake, and it was a bigger cake.  It was ready as promised.  It looked great but the big test was taste.  This was a very special cake because it was for my daughters 18th birthday.  The taste also exceeded our expectations.  Awesome baker!"}
{"text":"Brian is absolutely amazing!! He made my mom's 70th birthday cake so memorable, everyone couldn't stop talking about it.  The cake tasted as scrumptious as it looked. He was extremely receptive to meeting all your needs and I am excited I've found a place for all my cakes! Thanks Brian and crew!"}
