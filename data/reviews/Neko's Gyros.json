{"text":"After months of looking around for some place close by and AUTHENTICALLY GREEK .  We stumbled upon Neko's Gyros  ( it's Ed's Grill & Gyros now ) . We were in a hurry so I ordered the Gyro combo. The lady in the kitchen was very fast and  It was VERY tasty and not at all greasy as some other Gyro places can be.   I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Had the beef gyro and was very pleased that meat wasn't super greasy. The taziki sauce is on point. All around solid meal!"}
