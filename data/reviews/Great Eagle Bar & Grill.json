{"text":"This place is the shit!!!! Good food, and good drink specials. Friendly bartenders. Golf course is good during winter. Good times"}
{"text":"My sister & I decided to try somewhere new to have lunch. We looked up places to have lunch on the internet. We happened upon this little hole in wall, which happens to have good food & drink. They also have quite a few t.v.'s so everyone has an opportunity to watch whatever sport they want. I would recommend this little hole."}
{"text":"If there was a minus star review, this place deserves it! I was a bystander, no alcohol, witness to a horrible scene at this place! I saw a large waitress who came to the back bar. I was waiting for my turn on karaoke. Two stools down from me was a hearing impaired man. When he ordered a beer she yelled WHAT? three times, to which he didn't respond. Then he looked at another couple who saw the scene and said, \"that tells me she doesn't want a tip\"! After he waited 15 more minutes to pay his tab, and only when the other couple was able to signal a different staff member, could he pay and leave! People were saying, if they can't take the time for you to pay, then leave! The horrible part was, the younger couple made a complaint about the large waitress making fun of him, the manager did nothing! Pulled her into office, then she came out and looked at the couple like a Cheshire Cat! Turns out she didn't have to serve them anymore cause they complained!  This waitress was clearly mocking this older man, clear to all around him, and yet the manager did nothing but allow her to be worse! I think I heard him say she was joking? But I left, and won't return for karaoke ever! I had horrible service too, but didn't need much!"}
{"text":"Awesome bartender Jana is the best ever... Will be back always.. Wish we could give more than 5 stars..  Excellent food also.."}
{"text":"Don't even think about it - stopped in for lunch and their menu seemed to highlight their burgers so I dove in - ordered medium rare and 20 minutes later got an inedible burnt excuse for a burger. Not well done - burnt to a crisp. It could have passes for bacon.  Requested mayonnaise and ketchup and got the ketchup - even that wasn't enough to return a little moisture to this offering. Service? Not here.  Not busy, but totally ignored customers other than ?regulars?.  If they want to be private they should advertise that way.  Unfortunately wont be back- but they will never know cos they never asked! Wife ordered a Ruben but not delivered as described - she's not returning either"}
{"text":"When my husband has to walk up to the bar and find the waitress to get our drinks filled at the end of the meal, not a happy camper. Our table of two and another table of two next to us and one guy sitting at the bar doesn't make for a busy day that you can't come and check on your customers. A total of five people in the whole place dining, two waitress/bartenders and horrible customer service. The other nice waitress who wasn't ours came and cleared our plates after 10 min of hanging out. When we were done my Husband once again had to go find the check so we could leave. Our waitress never came back. As for the burger, my husband enjoyed it because it was grilled on an open flame. Fries are frozen from a bag like the ones we get from dollar tree. Only way I would go back is for happy hour where I don't rely on a waitress to serve us. Two stars because hubby liked his burger"}
{"text":"Frozen burger patties - kinda says it all food wise. It's too bad because the service is outstanding. Ton of beers on tap. Fridays they do a fish fry which is good. The menu is limited to mostly frozen proteins. If it weren't for the frozen burger patties used which you'll never get cooked to anything less than well done and beyond I'd rate them higher. Staff is great and like I said service rocks! I wish they'd let the cooks use better ingredients, because they know they're doing back there."}
{"text":"My Fiance and I went here today as we like to try new things. Place was blah, we were told by our waitress they have the best food,everything on the menu was good. She was wrong! $45.00 that's right , for two burgers, fries, 10 wings and two drinks!!!! The burger was just ok, not the best. Wings came out during our meal, I thought appetizers were supposed to be first. My sweet potatoe fries were well done.. the only good thing was my coke and the waitress. Way over priced!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game!!!! Huge beer selection. The Seattle fans can be a little much, but just yell back at them and they will shut up."}
{"text":"Great place friendly staff. Food is good and great service. Can't go wrong, lots of TVS. Better then a lot of other places around here"}
{"text":"After playing golf, it's nice to enjoy a cold beer and just relax. We have played this course numerous times but tonight was the first time we had dinner at the bar. There are tons of TV, tables, and a wide selection of beers. Very packed but short staffed it seemed like. We ordered onion rings to start with,  a grilled chicken sandwich, and chicken tenders. Like some of the other reviews,  our onion rings came with my chicken sandwich. Our waitress didn't come until we were half way thru the onion rings and my husband asked if his chicken tenders were coming.  She said they are just finishing it up but we're pretty sure they forgot it. A different waitress brought the tenders and saw that I had my sandwich already. She asked how long we've had the other food and she knew we have been waiting for a while. She very nice and apologized. It was a busy night with football being on and it is Saturday.  Management should have staffed better. Food was ok,  not the best. We had a sandwich, onion rings, chicken tenders, and three beers and was about $36."}
{"text":"Came with my Dad to play a round of golf and stopped in for a bite and a beer.   The food took forever and my French fries were ice cold.  We asked for new ones and she forgot and forgot.  We never got new ones.  Only giving a 2 because the bartender was so friendly but the server was awful."}
{"text":"They always have a good variety on tap, I counted at least 16 different just now. Game watching is excellent! They have 5 different projectors 100+ inch range easily with another set at 20ft x15ft hd! Tasty food also the flat breads are right! Service is great, service with a smile:) on the list for new Thursday hang out!"}
{"text":"Until last Winter this place had the best service and prices!  Now, prices have risen, service is poor.  We rarely go anymore."}
{"text":"I love this place. Everyone is kind food is great! Great neighborhood place! Thanks for the excellent service."}
{"text":"Had a great time with my son after a round of golf. I had just a hot dog with fries and he had a turkey sandwich with fries. Plenty of space to choose from to sit and watch a game. Service was reasonable, and the workers were very courteous. Hot dog was just fine, fries were the shoe string type. Meals were served hot and drinks were cold. Will be back again."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot in Surprise.  Closest restaurant to my house.  Awesome big screens all over.  Great happy hour specials!"}
{"text":"First time here food was great I had the breakfast burrito boyfriend had bisquits an gravy with eggs , server was very friendly we will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"We are very sorry you didn't like the review that we posted. We really enjoyed the experience we had. The fish fry was so good and Jana was the best. We will be back."}
{"text":"I came over here to check it out and I got a hotdog with fries because honestly I think everything here is a bit pricey. When my hot dog arrived it looked pretty good but wasn't as good as it looked... the costumer service was pretty chill but it wasn't really a good atmosphere in my opinion I felt uncomfortable for some reason and the hot dog kinda made me sick afterwards. I may come back but I'm not sure yet so I'm going to give it 3 Stars..."}
{"text":"Stopped in here a few times, burgers are good bout it...too many asshole Seattle  & SF fans in here ..Quit coming in.."}
{"text":"Love this place. I won't lie... the place lived up. Amazing food, I fell in love with the handmade chips and salsa. And now I can move on with my life."}
{"text":"This place has terrible customer service. Party of 7 waited over 1 & 1/2  hour for our food and then only 4 of the 7 received their food.  After waiting 2 hours we ask about the rest of the dinners and were told that we hadn't been there that long.  All while we watched the wait staff eat at the counter.  Never received an apology from the wait staff or any explanation for the poor service.   Need the staff to be trained in customer service and how to respect the public."}
{"text":"I LOVE this bar & grill! The happy hour is great..really cheap beers and mixed drinks! Their wings are amazing...best I've had in a while! It's kinda hidden behind the pro shop at Great Eagle Golf Club. The cheap drinks and awesome food is worth giving it a try!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried for the first time.  Very disappointed.  We ordered lunch and it was $27 with water, no drinks.  My Rueben was ok .. but very little meat.  My husband's party melt was good.  Our main problem is what you get for the price.  A Rueben and a patty melt for lunch - $27 + tip.  The side dishes (except for fries), they charge you.  It says it on the menu, but I didn't notice.  My small salad was $4 extra.  Hiway robbery, in my opinion"}
{"text":"This place has the potential to be good! BUT, wow they have some waitress and bus kids that are just rude and very lazy! You can sit at the bar and not be acknowledged for 10-15 minutes. Don't think of asking for service, there is one waitress who has a habit of telling you that you can wait. The manager is the owner's friend and neither one of these guys can manage staff! Too many staff members under 27! The food is not bad, but try placing an order! Damn, a REAL BAR OWNER, could make this place great!  Oh, by the way, try to resist the urge to clean the bar yourself, just don't lean on it! Yuk! And one more downer, you have to leave the bar, go around a dark corner and find the dimly lit, isolated bathrooms behind the pro shop! HELLO, NOT SAFE, add some lights for safety managers! Creepy!"}
{"text":"Nice casual place. Low pressure staff. Food is a small enough menu that nothings bad."}
