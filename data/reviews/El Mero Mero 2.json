{"text":"If you want a good taco and tortillas with hot salsa you have found your place. Steak, cilantro, and onions on a corn tortillas  tastes like what you would get in Mexico City. Not much English is spoken and U.S. Citizenship is not is required to enter. There are 6-7 tables and a television on the wall, the food makes up for the lack of decor. The nice thing about this place. Is that, when people sit down to break bread  together it's ok that you and the wife are the only white faces in the place. Good food at a good price."}
{"text":"Hilariously enough I found this place by accident on my way back from the beach on my way to Taco Bell. I made a quick u-turn when I saw it off the side of the road. It's a tiny hole in the wall place with super affordable prices and amazing delicious and authentic Mexicans food. I got the rice and bean burrito and my friend had the chicken burrito. We were both very satisfied! My burrito was by far the best and most authentic one I've had since moving back to Cleveland. The chips and salsa were fresh and both were made at the restaurant. The dining area is very small and no frills, but the staff is very attentive and kind. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in the area!"}

{"text":"This is authentic food from Mexico. It's the best around. I was hoping to have Menudo but only offered on Sunday. Settled for Tacos instead. Super authentic. The tamarind drink is awesome. Definitely will go back again. This is purely caters to Mexicans."}
