{"text":"Found this spot right around the corner from my house. It was a quick stop for my son's breakfast before school. Didn't have time to review the menu but my son wanted some bacon, eggs and pancakes. We ordered the super breakfast combo which is 3 eggs, bacon, ham, sausage patty, pancakes and hash brown or fruit. We upgraded the pancakes to the banana nut and substituted rice instead of hash browns. Portion size was huge, my son and I shared and took home some of the leftover pancakes. The banana nut pancakes were great, you could taste the bananas and every few bites you got some nuts. For our first visit which was a quick stop we really enjoyed our breakfast and what we paid about $10. Plan to come back to check out more of the menu."}
{"text":"Tried this place today because Baby Stacks is usually so busy and I had been wanting to give it a go for a while. After this one visit all I can say is it is mediocre and I am not eager to come back.   The service was good - not fantastically attentive but very friendly. We had 4 different waitresses over the course of the meal so it seems they rely on each other which is fine. My plate was pretty disappointing. I ordered the corned beef hash with eggs over-easy and fruit instead of hash browns. They gave me hash browns as a mistake but immediately brought over a cup of fruit, which was a mug of cantaloupe and orange only but fresh. My first complaint is the eggs - they looked cooked but once I cut into the yolk there was a lot of clear raw egg white. This just isn't appetizing to me so I had to scoop a lot of it and the hash it ran into off my plate. Second complaint is the corned beef in the hash. It just wasn't very good. The beef is in cubes, not shredded, so the consistency was chewy and the flavor was slightly amiss. I tried the hash browns since they were there but they were pretty greasy and soggy. My English muffin didn't come with butter on it so I asked for some and it was really cold, too cold to spread. It may seem that I am being nit-picky but breakfast should be easy especially when it is this simple. Overall the people are nice and my bf enjoyed his steak and eggs for what it was.   Next time, though, I think I'll brave the crowd at baby Stacks."}
{"text":"Norm's is a consistently good breakfast place with a slight asian twist."}
{"text":"Highly recommend Norms Eggs Cafe. Always great food and service. Easy to locate. Can't go wrong. If you go on Sunday need to go early Norm has a great Church crowd after 10:00am"}
{"text":"A simple restaurant as far as you don't get bothered while eating or feel out of your element. The food is delicious and priced fairly. I've had breakfast foods only but both the sweeter side (pancakes and stuff) and the heartier side (huevos rancheros) are delicious. Norm is always there which is comforting."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now. Norm's is something of a hidden gem. The food is good, if not extravagant.  You can't beat the price for the quality and quantity. It has a diner feel with a great little bar where you can actually hear the person with whom you're talking."}
{"text":"Service was excellent along with the food. The cinnamon French toast was to die for per my 12 year-old. The blueberry pancakes were a two thumbs up per my 8 year-old who couldn't even finish them because there were so many. So much food and such a great taste, will go again."}
{"text":"Food was great.  Took the kids After the soccer game. Would recommend the place for most families. Lunch is good too. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place has so many good ratings. I had super breakfast combo and coffee. The eggs were too runny (ordered over medium). I asked waiter more cook. Sent back my 3 eggs twice finally they cooked my eggs over medium but I lost 1 egg. WHY??? Where is my another egg? I didn't eat any eggs but they charged me full. I payed full for my food but didn't leave tip for waiter. Waiter said to me \"Not my fault\" and \"No tip?\" Why she can ask me tip???  Service and coffee was just horrible. I think they need to be more organized to avoid all the careless mistakes they have been making. Shucks Norm, I won't be back!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast hands down, and the price makes it even better, this gentleman is incredible, norm is there almost every day working with his great team. They r fast the food is hot and made to order. Btw try the French toast. Good job norm keep up the good work will see u next week."}
{"text":"we wanted to try something new and found Norm's on Yelp.  We got there around 10:30am last Monday and only one other table was occupied.  we were a little concerned but figured we were just in between breakfast and lunch.  i had the corned beef hash and my friend had the veggie omelette. both portions were large and very reasonably priced!  I had the leftovers as another meal.    They've only been open a little over a month but have a great start!  when we left most of the tables had customers but the counter area was free.  nothing over the top, but good food, great portions and prices, with friendly and caring staff."}
{"text":"Went here on our way out of town since we pass it so often and wanted to give it a try.  When we arrived it took a minute to be seated and once the hostess was available she placed in the very back corner by the bathrooms, not an ideal spot but considering the lack of space in the place, we didn't complain. I looked at the menu hoping to have a mimosa as a celebratory item for our mini getaway and instead ordered a soda since they did not offer alcohol.   This is where the trouble began...The soda and waters that we ordered came back rather quickly. The soda was brought in the can with an extra glass, I explained to the waitress/hostess I would not need the extra glass, if you were going to give me the can and charge me the same as a fountain drink I would just drink it out of the can. We went ahead and placed our orders, he had steak and eggs and I ordered the huevos rancheros, the waitress commented on how good they were. It took a little bit for them to come back with our food and I'm pretty sure there was some sort of shift change or something because all of a sudden there were new waitresses and people sat after us were receiving their food. Finally a new waitress came back and brought our food out.  The steak and eggs was sad looking. The 8 oz steak was a little overdone for medium and frankly way to small for that big mean plate.   My huevos rancheros....were not huevos rancheros...I have never been so repulsed by a plate. Under the mountain of melted and slightly burned cheese was some more grease with bell peppers, carrots, tomatoes, and then the eggs and beans and somewhere underneath that was the tortilla. The beautiful part about huevos rancheros are the eggs and I couldn't even find them. After a few minutes of trying to get past the carrots, which if I had known that they were on there I never would have ordered this item, I gave up and felt sick. I had run out of soda and water and steak and eggs was out of water too and for the life of me the new waitresses would not come back to give us anything else...I told steak and eggs that I was going to the bathroom and he could send my food away..  After a small upheaval in the bathroom, I came out and he was explaining to the manager Norm that I did not like my food on the advice of his waitress and Norm asked me what was wrong with it...Sorry Norm, I didn't have the time. Just look up a better recipe. He said he would have offered to exchange my order out but honestly, if your cooks can not prepare a simple dish of a tortilla, beans, eggs, and salsa and maybe some cheese, I can not take the chance. All in all, I'm glad I am the minority of this place."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place for breakfast and lunch. Basic menu and food but done well. For me simplicity is best for small cafes like this and they do a great job with full flavors, fresh ingredients and presentation. Good service with a friendly and welcoming staff."}
{"text":"Great place for traditional breakfast and lunch. Mr. Norm is always in the kitchen over seeing food preparation  and helping out his staff. We love coming here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I saw this place while taking our dogs to the groomer. I was rather excited thinking their menu would be something along the lines of The Cracked Egg and Egg Works.  The staff is very friendly and the menu items looked enticing. I ordered the Red Velvet pancakes since many reviews stated that it was one of their better dishes. Well, it was ok. I have tasted better. It tasted like a cream cheese pancake. My boyfriend ordered the Belgium Waffles and he asked if he could get strawberries on top or even strawberry syrup. They stated that they did not have fruits or fruit flavored syrup. This was rather astonishing to discover. His waffles were soggy inside and out. A Belgium waffle should be hard or crunchy I should say on the outside, and soft on the inside.   I think that people should give it a shot, but personally I would rather go to another breakfast/lunch place."}
{"text":"Good food and quick service. There's also a lot of tasty options. Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"The service is great, location is small and cozy not crowded tho. The food is ok I got the crab cake eggs Benedict they where well as good as egg Benedict could get I guess it was my first time trying them, my hubby got the country fried steak it was ok but tough to chew I didn't even taste my kids pancakes when I was cutting them up for him they where tough too I don't think we'll be back but I'm not apposed to trying there lunch menu."}
{"text":"Norm's is okay, just average place. Nice and clean. Waitresses are so nice, attentive and beautiful. Had the super breakfast got the banana  nut pancakes also,had nuts and bananas in it. Very Great pancakes."}
{"text":"My go to place for breakfast and lunch! LOVE their hamburgers and fries! Their wraps are delicious and of course, can't go wrong with the pancakes, potatoes, and eggs! Hands down, my favorite place!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Norms on several occasions.   I like to support local small businesses.   I must say, though nothing shouts out, \"order me, order me\",  what I have tasted has always been good.  Today was the spinach and mushroom omelet with hash browns and toast.   The portions are generous, served hot.  The food servers are also friendly and courteous.  Most times you will see Norm working the crowd...I like that."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very casual cafe environment. Staff is friendly and prices are great. Best is they use fresh ingredients, not the typical frozen fare."}
{"text":"Love the attentive staff, great eats all around... Not sure why others posting on here are giving this place such a poor rating.  I eat here at least twice a week as again I prefer locally owned Mom and Pop Cafes over \"Dennys\" or \"IHOP\"."}
{"text":"Norm's is just a few blocks from my home , so I was really hoping that it would blow me away. We had the  lemon ricotta pancakes and the red velvet pancakes.                    The red velvet pancakes was spot on, nice and fluffy strong chocolate flavor. This was the star this morning hands down.                                 Lemon ricotta pancakes had a nice aroma of lemons and was garnished with lemon zest ,I wish it had a stronger lemon presence flavor wise, the ricotta cheese did not add anything positive in my opinion, to me it just made the pancakes seem like it was under cooked.                        Service was very good .kept my coffee filled up and checked up on us frequently.   I would not hesitate to order the red velvet pancakes again. I will have to try the other menu items that looked interesting to me , so I will be back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, I had the turkey club n fries, $6.95, a lot of food! Very good. Wife had the reuben sandwich with fries, $6.50, very good also. The club was pretty big, ate the other half and other half of fries for dinner. Check this place out."}
{"text":"The wife and I went to Norm's for the first time last Saturday and we will be going back. We ordered off the breakfast menu, She had the steak and eggs(scrambled) with the hash browns. I had the bagel and lox plate.  Everything was really good. I had my reservations going in about getting lox at a strip mall breakfast joint but walked away full and pleasantly surprised. It came with everything you want; soft toasted bagel, smooth cream cheese, red onions, capers, tomatoes and of course the smoked salmon. It was sliced a little thicker that I would have liked but it was tasty and tender. I just really wanted bagels and lox, and I couldn't go to Bagel Café because the first and only time I went there I got horribly sick from a knish of all things. Throwing up a knish makes it hard to want to make a return visit.  My wife's steak and eggs plate was good for the cost. Eggs were scrambled and dry just the way she likes them. Steak was a bit overcooked but had good charbroiled flavor.  Finally a word or two about the hash browns. I love hash browns! Brown and crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. That's tender yet firm on the inside, not mushy. I got a side order of hash brown. If you refer to my review of Baby Cakes you'll see how important hash browns are to my breakfast dining experience. For $1.75 I was given a large portion. A large, yummy, satisfying portion of perfectly cook shredded potatoes.  I noticed a lot of sub-par reviews mentioned the slow service. On our visit service was excellent. Food was delivered in a timely manner and my water glass was always filled at just the right time."}
{"text":"Everything is cooked from scratch. Well worth waiting for. Matzo Ball soup was especially good and included strips of chicken. Tried lox platter before and was very fresh and tasty. I also found the service to be exceptional."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and service and priced right. Neighborhood friendliness! I try to eat here once a week. The staff is very capable, get it right every time, never a mix-up."}
{"text":"Without fanfare and with little advertisement Norm's has become popular due to good food at good prices. My wife and I rate Mr. Mamas and Norm's the 2 best values, and Squeeze In and Denny's the 2 worst, in our opinions."}
{"text":"The personal service is what really makes this place special. Norm is an excellent host and makes everyone feel at home. The cafe has a neighborhood feel to it. Every employee Ive encountered has been not just polite and professional but actually genuinely nice people. The food is great. Hearty and plentiful. I can't ever finish it all. But my favorite is the lemon pancakes. Just sweet enough without going overboard and becoming dessert instead of breakfast. Awesome place to meet friends for a relaxing meal. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My Husband and I have been here three times and we have been very satisfied. The food is very good and the staff always friendly."}
{"text":"As you can see, I rarely, if even write positive reviews. Yelp is my place to vent about bad business, but I genuinely love this place. Inside and out, from the food to the staff, this place has it all. Their menu, though it isn't as lavish as Eggworks or other breakfast places around, has everything you need in a breakfast. The owner has been there every time we've come in and they really seem to appreciate your business, basically you're not just another person."}
{"text":"Fantastic food at a great price. Friendly staff. I will definitely keep coming back for more."}
{"text":"It's....eggs. Nothing fancy or out of this world, but I find myself eating here about every other Sunday morning. I sit outside, watch the people at the park,catch up on emails(their WIFI is fast) and indulge my Eggs Benedict addiction."}
{"text":"Good selections of omelets and other breakfast items. The husband and I stopped in for breakfast he had the Denver omelet. I couldn't resist the tomato basil omelet because it's not something you see every day. Both were solid. Breakfast was under $20 and they had us in and out in hurry. Last of a dying breed."}
{"text":"Super friendly.  Very attentive service.    We stopped in because we dropped off our puppy next door at the pet hospital and saw this place next door, and thought we give it a try.     Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I am only giving this 3 stars because the chocolate pancakes and Hawaiian papaya was good.  Everything else such as the loco moco wasn't very good.  First of all its stacked and not placed on a plate separate.  If you are going to serve it, serve it right! The other Asian specialty with the porridge was horrible! And to top it off, someone needs to teach the cook how to cook rice! It was so hard I almost barfed! This isn't a hidden gem in my eyes. There are many other better breakfast places in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I would come here at least once a week when I lived in Vegas. They have great breakfast concepts and the food is always fresh! I made it a point to come back when I visited recently and Norm has not lost a step. Thank you for being my favorite breakfast and lunch spot in west Vegas!"}
{"text":"The service is pretty slow here. We walked in and were confused about what to do as no one approached us. Eventually a man told us to sit wherever we wanted and menus would be brought to us. Okay, so we look around... There was no where to sit. All tables were either taken or dirty. The man offered us no more help. Eventually one of the waitresses clears a table. We sit down and wait a few minutes for our menus. It took about 10 minutes for our order to be taken and our food took about 25 minutes to get to us (it was a Saturday at around 11am).   As for the food, I was not a fan. The eggs were pretty crusty, the hash browns were alright, and the red velvet pancakes were pretty disappointing. The cream cheese frosting is too cream cheesy. I would have liked it to be sweeter. Overall I would just say I'm not coming back here. Wasn't bad for a new try, but I'm definitely not a fan."}
{"text":"2nd visit to norm's since gf was having oil changed nearby.  place was busier than my last visit so that's a good thing.  I tried the country fried steak and eggs with a biscuit.  gf had egg white veggie omelet with bagel.  Again, good service, timely refills on coffee and water and food came out quick.  the food - Norm's comes up short again.  The CFS - small and overcooked.  the gravy was decent though i prefer to see chunks of meat in the gravy.  the biscuit crumbled as i cut it - that's not good.  GF did like the veggie omelet but the bagel wasn't fresh.  I think the next oil change will not include a visit to Norm's"}
{"text":"I was overall satisfied with my visit to this establishment.    The first issue I had was the coffee mug brought to me had a coffee stain on it that was not cleaned in the dishwasher.  i believe that the mug itself was sanitized, (or at least I really want to believe that it was), but i sent it back because I was uncomfortable with the implications regarding germs.  the server was fast and took the mug without any objection.    I tend to love knowing my servers name, but I never got the chance to ask because I had 3 different people wait on me.  it was an interesting take on the industry standard, but not none necessarily good or bad.  just interesting.  i wonder if this is the way that Norm's does it.  It does beg the question of tips: do they pool?    I got the italian omelet which came with toast.  It was tasty and I finished the plate, but one piece of toast had a small thick gray hair on it.  at this point I did not complain. My concern was that i didn't want the server to think I was trying to get something for free and I guess I could afford to be a little less picky...   I won't go back here because of the hair and stain, but i wouldn't say no if someone offered to pay for bfast.    Toward the end of our breakfast, a spanish speaking woman took over as our server, and this pleased me.  I love having multicultural staff wherever I go!  GO VEGAS!!!"}
{"text":"Love this little breakfast spot. Good food, huge portions and staff is really friendly :) If you want a good nap after breakfast, I recommend the Lumberjack!"}
{"text":"Great service and very friendly and attentive. However the coffee was average and the food too. The bacon was good. The multi grain pancakes were good but the regular were box pancakes and not that great. Also hash browns were bland and appeared to be out of a bag not home made. My egg whites were overcooked.  Not good ventilation walked out smelling like I cooked the food myself. They do give you a lot for the price."}
{"text":"Always a good alternative to the chain type restaurants, quick service and good food makes for a pleasant change of pace."}
{"text":"I love Norm's. The food is good and a little unique. The owner is always walking around making sure people are happy. I go there regularly. If you want a good breakfast with a smile visit norms.  I love their corned beef hash.  The five star is because I rate it amongst other resteraunts of the same type."}
{"text":"I went here twice,  once for lunch/dinner. Yesterday I was craving breakfast food. I just wanted a simple ham and cheese omelette, hash browns, and bacon. Normally, any inexpensive restaurant I go to for breakfast disappoints me. They undercook the eggs, overcook the bacon, and the hashbrown are never crispy. Let me tell you, I was in breakfast HEAVEN yesterday!!! Everything was cooked exactly how I would've made it at home. It was absolutely delicious, and inexpensive. Our waiter (I forgot his name) was so nice and attentive. I am definitely going to be a regular for breakfast food! The fact that it's down the street from my house is a total bonus!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  Very good service, awesome food, and it's extremely clean!  Norm himself came out to make sure everything was up to par and made sure our experience was one truly to remember."}
{"text":"I was SO excited when I happen to drive by this place after searching on yelp for good breakfast eats and i was even more excited when I read the menu posted in the window. Very chill atmosphere with really nice people working/eating there. Very much a neighborhood spot.  Ordered the lumberjack special, which was biscuits and gravy served with eggs and sausage and hash browns. Yum, you can't find breakfast eats like that in the north east. Sadly, they were out of biscuits, so I had to get it with english muffins. Still good, but certainly not the same.   I wish I could go back and try the Lox platter before I leave."}
{"text":"We love Norm\"s for a quick meal.  There is a nice variety of items and the staff is super friendly and also make you feel welcome. Of course the price is friendly too"}
{"text":"Didn't know what to eat at home so I decided to try this place out this morning. The prices are decent and the amount of food is a pretty good portion. I got the Steal and Eggs which came with toast and fruit. I loved the staff and Norm was actually there in person. It's a very friendly place to eat in and I would definitely consider going back."}
{"text":"Really good eggs Benedict, friendly staff, and small diner experience make this place a great choice for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Had a young man named Charlie washing dishes 6mos.thought better to let someone walk in off the street to give a job this kid Charlie should of got maybe good food but norms work ethic sucks would not recommend"}
{"text":"I read yelp reviews for this place and decided to stop in with my hubby. The food was great and they have huge portions for about $8-10. It was fresh and my young waiter was polite and attentive... The only thing that really left a bad taste in my mouth was halfway through, I realized I did not get my hash browns and my hubby did not get his fruit bowl,which were included in the cost of our super breakfast combos (I forget the name exactly, but it was the first thing on the list). My hubby convinced me not to ask about it, since we already had such huge breakfasts. I still felt like \"ya,but dammit, I'm paying for it.\" I was full, even after the shortage of hash browns, and I had to take pancakes home i was so stuffed.  Other than that...its in a convenient location, the menu is simple, and on the back of the receipt, they stamped a $3 off coupon for fab freddy's carwash, should I want one of those. Not sure if I'd return...maybe with a groupon I would."}
{"text":"Good overall experience and food was quite good.. Service was ok, we went on a mid Saturday morning and they were busy!!"}
{"text":"Awesome and friendly workers, our server always checked if we were ok, our meal was more than enough. Totally worth having Breakfast here.. P.S. A Breakfast Fan"}
{"text":"Standard breakfast. $1more for cheese, the make it a combo is$4 more the prices are different fromThe menu listed on here"}
{"text":"I love their service here. I had the Super Breakfast...Pancakes were awesome and scrambled soft eggs. Good off-the-strip neighborhood restaurant since Del Mar Cafe is out of biz, this is my new fav."}
{"text":"Great place! That french toast combo is the bomb, and their sandwiches are HUGE and so delicious. Norm is so friendly, the waiters were constantly checking on me if i needed a refill on my drink. Such a great breakfast place. And those fries! Pass up on the home fries and get some french fries with your eggs, trust me, its so good."}
{"text":"Great new breakfast place, and I love that they open at 6am compared to most places at 7am or 8am.  They do have the BEST french toast I have had in a very long time.  They use actual cinnamon bread for their french toast!  AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Great little cafe! The food is amazing and they have some unique dishes on their breakfast menu. The lox scramble is my favorite! The staff is very friendly and down to earth and Norm is such a genuine guy! I stop in for lunch every now and then when I feel like I need some comfort food. There is something on the menu for everyone. I definitely recommend to anyone looking for great food at good prices!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast there today.  My husband ordered an english muffin with his breakfast. Never received it. His bacon was pre cooked and greasy. I had the Chicken fried steak. As others have noted, it was horrible. Had some kind of egg batter on it. It was obviously pre made and reheated. The worst part was that it tasted like it was old and starting to spoil. It tasted terrible! The gravy was gooey and tasteless. We will never go back. The cook did not have a hat on as required by health code!"}
{"text":"I went in with a few friends to try it as it boldly advertises a great breakfast experience and some of the best eggs benedict in LV. I would say not. One friend had it and they were mediocre at best. My waffle was soggy, not cooked enough and drowning under too much whipped cream and fruit. Another friend ordered something that was a little too spicy, and with a lot of hesitation sent it back for something else. If you've watched Waiting or work in food service it's obvious why the hesitation. So they sent her out something so hot it burned her mouth and the workers in the kitchen were watching her and laughed to themselves. I know that may sound a little dramatic, but both my other friend and I saw it happen and I had to hold him back from going back there and laying someone out. The waitress actually had to apologize to us about the behavior of their staff. That's inexcusable, the whole incident never should have happened and says a lot about who they hire and how they train them. I wouldn't have come back here anyway just based on the food, but with the service issues they don't have to worry about me or my friends as repeat customers. Avoid this place, there are several much better places in the area, from Skinny Fats to Waffles Cafe to Baby Stacks. Norm's is a joke."}
{"text":"I had to get this up for Misti!  Norm's Eggs Cafe is a spot for those who appreciate a simple, pleasant experience. The place is small and cozy. the menu is simple and this lends to the other qualities they exhibit. Because the menu is basic, the prices are low and the food is prepared quickly and consistently :) From a management standpoint, they must have considered all the things that make bigger places crappy and said \"NOPE! Let's keep it simple\"  The floor space and tables are open, 2 of the walls are full windows, allowing in loads of natural light (and the building faces South East... Great for us, terrible for your vampire friends). Also, the cooking area is open, so you can see everything.   Service: When you open the door, everyone working says \"Hello\" and \"Good morning\". My coffee was yummy, not gourmet, but not walmart brand. And the cup was never empty. Our server, Allison, was very friendly, helpful and patient with us.  Food: Blueberry pancakes, 2 eggs over medium, bacon and some hash-browns, which were crispy brown on top. The potions were reasonable, as in, I actually ate most of what I was given and didn't feel like a damn pig  This is a place for those who like the old time feel. It reminds me of my favorite dinners in the North-East and the Mid-West. If you ever feel in love with a local spot in Arkansas or Kentucky, give Norm's a shot. I think they will earn your business."}
{"text":"Went here for Mother's Day breakfast. We had fun. I love their menu and so does my 3 year old son. Went back a few weeks later with friends and they loved it. Even saw some co-workers there too. Nice little joint very reasonable and close to alot of things."}
{"text":"Went here twice for breakfast while I was in town for Iron Maiden - the food is good, the prices are reasonable, and the service is incredibly friendly. It isn't perfect (the food comes out a little slow even when the place isn't packed), but it's a decent breakfast stop."}
{"text":"I have eaten at various breakfast establishments in Las Vegas for the past 25 years. That is until I ate at Norms. Now I only eat breakfast at one.  The food is amazing. The prices more than fair. I typically order the tomato basil egg white omelet. It is served with brown rice and a fruit cup that has fruit cut fresh daily. The lemon ricotta pancakes although not good for the diet, taste terrific. The creamy ricotta oozes out of every bite. The sweetness, cut by the hint of lemon. The banana pancakes are not pancakes with bananas on top. The bananas are cooked right in the batter creating an unmatched sweetness. The nuts give it a bit of a crunch. The batter is light but tasty. All the luncheon specials are home made and delicious. The meatloaf uses ground turkey and beef. The pot roast is tasty, not fatty. He features ever changing specials which are written on a board. All of the specials are fine. Norms has home cooked meals, a very friendly staff that is quick to fill the coffee and more than reasonable prices. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I ordered food for take out for my husband and I to eat at his work and by the time I got to Norms to pick up the food the girl at the counter looked at me like I had 4 noses or something...the other girl at the counter took over and was very nice paid for food and left, sit down to eat at husbands place and the food was tasteless had NO flavoring at all it was chicken fried steak it should of at least had pepper in it, the gravy was like paste and flavorless just like the steak was...I'll try it again but so far not that impressed."}
{"text":"I was of course excited to see that a new breakfast place opened up. I'm a sucker for breakfast foods - and am still trying to find the best Chicken Fried Steak in Vegas.   I went here for breakfast a couple weeks ago - only one other table was occupied. That kind of got me worried, but I was excited nonetheless. The chicken fried steak was decent. Not the best I've ever had, but it wasn't the worst. The batter on it was thin, but a little soggy. The steak was a bit chewy but nothing that wasn't manageable. I had good flavor. The gravy was pretty good as well. I opted for the fruit cup instead of the hash browns - and the fruit seemed pretty fresh.   All in all, a decent experience. The service was quick and good. It's definitely a place I would go back to for breakfast if I'm in the neighborhood. But, my quest to find the best chicken fried steak hasn't quite been satisfied yet."}
{"text":"I ran to the DMV Friday only to be greeted with a REALLY long line. After checking in online, I knew I had time to waste and wanted to get something to eat. After a quick yelp search, I came across Norm's which also offered free wifi so I headed on over.   I walked in and was quickly greeted with a smiling face. I sat down and started looking at the menu while the server got me coffee and water. I ordered and realized my computer was dead. They quickly and happily helped me move over the the bar/counter and get set up. Shortly my order arrived and it was just what the doctor ordered. The food was great without being greasy. The eggs were cooked perfectly. The coffee was good and the service was friendly.   I don't typically walk away from breakfast places thinking I should come back more often, but I definitely will swing by here next time I'm looking for a morning meal or maybe even lunch. I even must note the owner (or I assume that's who he was) was super friendly as well. I totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I've been looking for eggs benedict here for a while (I always end up at Timbers for breakfast!) and this place has it!  Not only do they have the OG benedict, they have specialty ones (crab cake benedict?! On the list to try!)  Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day, and I will be back to this place again!  It's small, diner-y, friendly service and good food."}
{"text":"My go to breakfast joint! They have seating outside, which is nice when you have a dog with you. They are also dog friendly, offering water for my pup. Great if you just came from the park! Love the staff, always friendly and attentive. The food not only taste great but serves in a big portion too. We will be coming here for a while :)"}
{"text":"I read a lot of accurate 3* reviews here but giving it 4* because Norm always treats me and my wife well and makes us feel a tad special. They have flaws and they make mistakes like any other place but they do their best to make sure you are satisfied and get what you want. As  long as you tell them that something is not the way you wanted or expected they will make up! If you don't give them feedback right away and let them have a chance to improve, you might just leave with a resentment and leave a 2* review!"}
{"text":"It's comfortable and personal.  Norm is usually there and adds charm to the place.  The servers have all been there for a long time (some since it first opened), which speaks volumes about the type of place and people here.  If you come here a few times, they will recognize you and greet you like a friend.    The red velvet pancakes are a favorite for my kids.  The jian-bing (chinese pancake with eggs) is excellent.  Steak and eggs are very so-so.  Omelettes are very good with generous portions of potatoes.  Early on, the fruit cups were pretty bad, but Norm took the feedback and improved the quality of the fruit significantly.    All in all, a good place for the first cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Bad bad service is the summary of this review. I was here on a Saturday morning around 9:30 and Norm's had a pretty good crowd. There were a few empty tables, maybe 1 outside and 2 inside but it was close to full. We walked in, party of 2, and were seated at a small 2 top along the windows. As we were seated our drink order was taken...and that was it. After twenty-two minutes without a glass of water or a simple \"have you been waited on?\" we walked out. It took twenty-two minutes to decide there would be no need to return to Norm's. Of all the employees that shuffled past, going about their chores, not one could be bothered to offer their services.   Yuck."}
{"text":"Have only been here once. Service was excellent! Food was great! I had the chicken fried steak...so yummy. But the best part of the meal was the biscuit!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Norm is very accommodating, food is good, prices aren't  crazy. If you want anything just ask."}
{"text":"It was actually pretty good! The staff was really friendly  & at top speed, the prices were also exponentially awesome, I got the french toast w/a side of sausage & a lemonade and my boyfriend got the red velvet pancakes (which he slaughtered btw) with a side of bacon and orange juice leaving the total at only $23! We will be back! :)"}
{"text":"I've had Huevos Ranchero in alot of places and in alot of states, including Mexico... Norm hooks up THE BEST HUEVOS RANCHERO EVER ! ! ! its like a magic cure for my hangovers..I've also tried the biscuits and gravy, which was excellent and im very picky bout my biscuits n gravy :) It's very noticable that they use fresh ingredients and make everything \"in-house\"  the lunch menu looks very appetising also very importantly, AFFORDABLE. great views of the city and desert breeze park..This place is a goldmine, but dont tell anybody, cause i'll be pissed when it catches on and i gotta wait in line to get my huevos rancheros...its nice to see an owner operator..great personal touch"}
{"text":"I got the chicken fried steak and eggs. I only give it 4 stars because my steak was not too flavorful. I did hpwever, enjoy their buttermilk biscuits. I also had their blueberry pancakes which were out of this world. They had fresh blueberries (not frozen) and I could tell their batter wasnt pre made powdered crap. It was delicious. The only thing I didn't like was my steak. The service was wonderful and everything else perfect. Next time I just wont get the steak."}
{"text":"It's a mom-and-popish spot but the food is less than decent. I ordered the Korean breakfast, and my rice was dry: it was crispy from being aged. My salmon was very bland, and the egg was tooooo salty. The only redeeming item on my plate was the kimchee, but to be fair, they don't prep kimchee...  My beau ordered steak and eggs. The steak was too cooked when he ordered medium rare. When he got his correct steak, it still wasn't appetizing. My mother got an omelette that she didn't even touch... So I can't really have an opinion on that other than there was too much egg and not enough stuffing from the outside.  The best part was the red velvet pancakes. If you end up here, I'd say get that even if you're on a diet or you will be unhappy with your food.  It is cheap though so you do get what you pay for. Service is OK, alert but not excessive."}
{"text":"Blueberry pancakes, eggs, bacon & fruit - all for around $7 - winner winner. Shared with my daughter. The food was great, Eggs cooked perfectly. They were busy and the servers were busy, but still friendly and helpful. The owner walked around when he had a minute to fill coffee & check on tables. I was so full when I left!"}
{"text":"Very solid for breakfast. Food is good, service solid, location convenient. Hard to find decent breakfast off the strip in vegas. Not spectacular but solid. I'd be back."}
{"text":"We loved it. We will be back. The only problem was choosing as there were a bunch of things that looked great. We will be back. Our food (lemon ricotta pancakes, chicken noodle soup, chicken pot pie) was excellent."}
{"text":"Another breakfast joint checked out.  Driving on Durango, you cant help but notice their big sign stating that they have the best Eggs Benedict. Since my wife loved Eggs Benedict, we stopped off one sunday morning at 9 am to check it out.   The menus they give you have breakfast on one side and lunch on the other. You can order anything on either side at any time.  So my wifey went with the Eggs Benedict ($8.95), my son went with the Club Sandwich ($8.95), and I went with the Barbeque Bacon Burger ($8.50).  The Eggs Benedict were ok. Nothing really wowed me about it and my wife agreed. The Club Sandwich on sourdough was not bad either. My son said he has had better Club Sandwiches at least two other places. As for my Barbeque Bacon Burger, it was on point meaning that it was really good. You get a half pound patty cooked to your liking (I got it medium rare which they cooked  perfect), lettuce, tomatoes, barbeque sauce and of course, bacon. It was a very good burger. Matter of fact I was not hungry again until dinner time that evening.  Service was hit and miss. We got sat down right away. Got our orders in a timely manner and refills on water were constant. What bothered me was that when I asked for the check, our server said she would be right back with it. 10 minutes later we havent heard from her. So we decided to go straight to the cash register to pay.  Overall, for a breakfast joint, everything seemed to average out to about 9 to 10 bucks a plate. I was not impressed at all with their Eggs Benedict. I'm not in any rush to come back here any time soon.  Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #192"}
{"text":"Killing time at the DMV so came here for lunch. Cute atmosphere and very good food. Waitresses were very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Typical breakfast joint that makes your needs. Nothing wow and food are average. Coffee is fresh and use lots of potatoes"}
{"text":"I had the chicken frittata and a cup of coffee. Food was okay, but nothing spectacular. Service was good."}
{"text":"I have been here many times with my boyfriend and the owner actually remembers us! The staff and the atmosphere makes you feel like you're at home.   Today I got the steak and eggs that comes with hash browns and toast. This is my default meal when I eat here. For a little over $9 this meal is worth it. It's filling and it tastes great! Surprisingly, their toast is also really good.   To be honest, I only get this meal so I can't really review on other dishes. This rating is based in their steak and eggs, Norm the owner, and the staff."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here, more so for the vibe than anything. Being a quaint breakfast eatery, Norm's reminds us just how great the diner feel is. With counter seating & the ability to watch the cook work his magic, it's fun and cozy.  What sums this place up is the fact that my plate was literally clean by the time the server came to clear the table.  'Nuff said."}
{"text":"The place is small, which I don't mind. I feel it could use some cozy decorations and definetely needs some seats for customers who need to wait to be seated; like my party had to. There was a huge party of about 18 people, which I'm sure they weren't expecting. So, understandably the service was very slow. The food was fine; nothing spectacular. It could have been hotter when brought out to the table, but I know I'm particular about that. I will give them one more shot becauase they were understaffed due to the large unexpected party. However, if I come back and one of the cooks, who happens to be the owner, is not wearing a cap while he's cooking as the health code in NV requires, I will never come back. The code is their to  prevent hair  and sweat falling into the food being prepared and that is just gross!"}
{"text":"The owner is always friendly and welcoming and a majority of the time the breakfasts items have been consistently good."}
{"text":"went with my family yesterday....this place is great!  Service fast and friendly.   will be going back for sure~"}
{"text":"The burrito I had for breakfast was amazing. My wife and I were both impressed by both the quality of the food and the speed of service. The location was easy to find, and it was \"seat yourself\". Prices were in the $7-10 range and we will definitely be back to try other things from the menu. If you're looking for a breakfast that you recognize but with a twist then you should give this place a try. It was great!"}
{"text":"A great alternative to the other brunch places I frequent. Absolutely as good as the other go-to places in Las Vegas. I eat at the counter because the staff is so friendly.   I typically get the veggie omelette with egg whites, and I havent been disappointed.  The price is really reasonable as well. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite breakfast places in Vegas, the owner is down to earth and it's feels like a mom and pop type of operation. The food is great and the prices are low!"}
{"text":"Norma's eggs café is a great breakfast for the price. The people are friendly and the food is great, the red velvet pancakes are the best and the multi grain pancake is the best as well if you're coming to Las Vegas this would be a place to find it's off the strip a little bit, but the breakfast is good & if you like good black coffee get the house coffee w/ espresso with vanilla it will wake you up!!:)"}
{"text":"I was really excited for this place, but I ordered food to go and was disappointed with it. I tried calling ahead and placing an order, but the phone number said to try call again later. Called back and it rang, but no answer. Tried my whole way there (10 minutes) and got no answer! Finally got there and ordered and was told 15 minutes. 20 minutes later I was given my red velvet pancakes and was headed back to my grandmas. They didn't put any butter in the bag, only 2 containers of the \"cream cheese frosting\". The actual pancakes were good, but I had to eat them dry because the \"frosting\" tasted like melted whipped cream so it was very bland.   Maybe other stuff is better? Next time I'll try somewhere else!"}
{"text":"We needed to go to Desert Breeze Park but it was 10:30am and we were starving.  I've passed by Norm's Eggs Cafe before and seeing the crowded parking lot...we decided to give it a shot.    We walked in at the first thing I noticed were the open doors and the fact that the A/C wasn't on.  I was about to leave and asked the owner (I believe this was Norm) whether the A/C was broken.  He said he would turn it on and he did.    Our family of five ordered:  Red Velvet Pancakes, Corned Beef Hash, Southern Fried Chicken, and Heuvos Rancheros.  The prices here are very reasonable with everything under $10.    The Red Velvet Pancakes were excellent.  I prefer Baby Cakes but these were very tasty.  The Corn Beef Hash was excellent.  Homemade hash and very well done.    The Southern Fried Chicken was okay,  The meat was a little tough.  The hash brown portion a little small.  The biscuit was a little dry.  The Huevos Rancheros were pretty flavorful and tasty.    Service was really good.  Prices were great.  I would return if we were in the area.  Thanks Norm!"}
{"text":"Gross.  My son had soccer games across the street. Between games we decided to grab brunch. Norm's was so close we figured it was the best bet.   The place was packed which I took as a good sign. However we were seated at a small, dirty table that I soon realized had small ants crawling on it. There was nowhere else for us to move. I killed the tiny ants, and noticed many were on the window pane next to us. But, yeah, who wants to eat with ants crawling around?   So, then our order comes and my son goes to pick up his fork which he realizes is crusted in old food. We asked for a new fork, no big deal. But it just makes you start to wonder.   My son said his pancakes were fine. Nothing special but not bad. I had a basil omelet. Basil is the last thing I'd call bland and yet, my omelet had zero flavor. I could see the basil leaves cooked right in there and yet there was no taste at all. The latte I ordered was terrible too.   It was not a good experience and, mostly due to cleanliness, we will not be back."}
{"text":"Decided to check out the best Benedict claiming place out. Not really. I've had much better Benedict and service elsewhere. Never had my coffee refilled and everything took forever. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"We had brunch at norms.  It was busy on a Sunday.  We decided to get breakfast. We got the super breakfast combo for $9.95.  3 eggs choice of ham sausage or bacon, pancakes and choice of either fruit or potatoes.  The food was nothing special.  My eggs a little runny.   Ok place. reminds me of a coffee shop.  Not somewhere id rush to go to but a restaurant I'd completely avoid."}
{"text":"So I went out today to go eat at another restaurant but it was closed. So I defaulted to Norm's.   The service was good. But I don't go to a restaurant only for the service. If a restaurant has really good food and the service isn't really good I will still go to the restaurant.   I ordered the chicken fried steak. It was that good. Had a good portion of steak but it wasn't really good. Pretty bland tasting. The eggs were under cooked to my liking. The hashbrowns were okay. Nothing amazing. They don't have a very large selection.  The prices are okay but they add up quick when you add cheese to your omelet or cream cheese to your bagel. I did not get those but my friend did get the omelet and a bagel. He didn't add cheese to his omelet but he did get a side of cream cheese for his bagel and I think it was over a dollar.  The restaurant was clean though. That is a plus. I probably wouldn't be coming back here or really recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"Service was amazing. It has a small town, everyone knows everyone feel to it. The owner always comes to the tables to check if everything came out alright. Portion sizes were pretty big and always fresh. They always keep the menu fresh by having Daily/weekly specials. There's outdoor seating so if you want to bring your pooch to breakfast you're more than welcome. There's a great view of the strip while your eating so it's a great start to your day."}
{"text":"My wife and I love Norm's, best service on the planet. Norm is always close by and always comes around to see how everyone is doing. The food is fantastic! Like any place, they do occasionally change cooks, so some of the reviews are outdated. Currently they have an excellent cook, and IF anything is ever wrong, bring it to Norms attention, believe me, he will make it right. She always gets the Eggs Benedict and I'm stuck between the French Toast and Omelets. You really can't go wrong. I would recommend the breakfast potatoes. They have counter space and tables with big windows looking at Dessert Breeze Park. We haven't told the kids about this place yet (6 years) it's our little getaway while they are in school. I would highly recommend trying Norms!!"}
{"text":"I enjoy Norm's Eggs Cafe as one of those places that never really lets you down. The food is always on par no matter what you order, the service is always quick and pleasant, and the place always seems to have an available table.  I have visited several times and have ordered various high-protein entrees and breakfast items such as the Chicken Fried Steak and the Steak and Eggs meal.  The highlight of the $7.99 Chicken Fried Steak is the gravy. I love gravy. I love all types of gravy. But the gravy here at Norm's is phenomenal! The chicken fried steak itself is served with two eggs cooked to your liking, homemade biscuits, and choice of potato or fruit.  The $8.95 Steak and Eggs meal was pretty cut and dry. I typically order my steaks medium rare as I have learned there is more potential for flavor this way. It came out a little too done, which is fine as I am not as picky as most eaters. It was a bit dry and a bit tough to cut through and I was thankful the server had brought me a steak knife and some A1 sauce. The steak itself was 8 oz., and came with two eggs, choice of potato or fruit, and also toast.  All in all, my experiences here were okay. I'd much rather frequent Norm's than an IHOP or a Denny's when it comes to breakfast type food. Also, be sure to give their $3.99 breakfast menu a peak! Not too shabby."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Saturday  Morning. .we expected  to be busy.waited 10 minutes to be seated ,waited 30 mins at table...no one in restaurant  acknowledged  us...never got our order taken..so we walked OUT! Let 2 servers know and they said OKAY! GREAT  WAY TO RUN A BUISNESS!"}
{"text":"The best eggs benedict I've had in a long time. The service is really good and the waitresses super friendly. I thought I would give this place a try and I was very impressed."}
{"text":"I didn't think my expectations for Norm's were too high, but I've been wrong before. I was looking for a decent diner style breakfast with friendly service. Unfortunately they didn't deliver.  The menu does have a good variety of choices.  Since I was heading out on a road trip with friends I to decided to play it safe and order the Lumberjack. The meat was what I would expect an elementary school to serve. It was very small and rubbery like it was microwaved. The biscuit and gravy was so terrible that I only managed 1 bite. The waitress never gave us refills on our drinks. We stopped another server and asked for refills, she said she would get our waitress. She never showed until she dropped off a group check at the end without stopping as she was waking (never asking if  we were paying together). When we got to the register, they had trouble separating the check. We were told we should have informed our waitress so 'it wouldn't take so long.' When you leave breakfast hungry something is obviously not right!"}
{"text":"Spacious new breakfast and lunch spot off of Durango. Friendly, quick service with plenty of tables and counter service.  Red velvet pancakes ($6.99) - rich, dense, chocolatey pancakes covered in a lattice work of cream cheese icing. The cakey texture will make you think you're eating a dessert for breakfast. It's delicious and worth the calories, but you'll fee guilty afterwards.  Steak \"Ooh-La-La\" ($6.50) - thinly sliced grilled steak covered with sauteed mushrooms, onions, bell peppers, and mozzarella on a toasted bun. Roughly a 6\" sub, the bread was chewy, fresh, lightly toasted to give the interior some crunch. good amount of ingredients in the sammie. The meat, mushrooms and onions were slightly overcooked but still tasty. Came with plenty of fries (probably frozen) and cole slaw. Good value for the price.  Their menu consists of plenty of breakfast items (many which are typical and can be found elsewhere), salads, soups, burgers, wraps, and sandwiches. They also have $5.99 lunch specials like meat loaf, pot roast, chicken curry and teriyaki chicken."}
{"text":"Bad all the way around. Service sucked. Steak was raw. Biscuit and gravy was so bad I would not have gave it to my dog. The eggs sucked. Everything was shitty. This place should close down asap."}
{"text":"EDIT- I just found this draft I forgot to post. I went here back in mid-June, just for the record.   Thanks for ruining my morning, Norm's Eggs Cafe!! The place is bright and clean, the people were friendly, and the wifi was free. I ordered their  big breakfast combination from a fairly simple menu. Also a cup of black coffee and a diet coke. The soda came in a can , and the coffee was hot and pretty good. I got my food and it looked pretty good too! The pancakes were decent, nothing spectacular but pancakes are pretty good no matter what right? I had ordered my eggs over medium, but I don't really think they were cooked quite enough. These things weren't a very big deal, but I then noticed my hash browns were swimming in grease. So was my sausage, and on closer inspection , so were the eggs. I don't mind a little grease because we all know that makes things taste better! But if you feel it congealing in your throat with every bite maybe it's time to rethink your cooking technique.  I would have nicely ask them to remake my food, except nobody ever bothered to come check on me. Not 1 refill of my coffee despite sitting at the bar directly in front of a full coffee pot. Not 1 reappearance of my waiter to see how things were even though my food was untouched. Twice, I thought someone was going to check on me, but it turned out they were just taking their break at the bar a few seats down from me. How nice that their food was cooked as they liked and their cups were full!   finally some lady came over and asked how everything was. I told her it was too greasy for me to eat. Her honest to god response? \"Next time, tell the cook to make it with less grease.\"  Well if you have to tell the cook how to make food edible, and you can't get a warm up on your coffee, what is the point of even eating breakfast here?? If you have an answer for that, maybe this place is for you. But if you would rather not start your day angry you just dropped $12  on inedible crap , a single cup of coffee, and a can of soda , just don't bother with this place"}
{"text":"Great food - Very nice service! Great neighborhood breakfast spot!  Went in there for the first time with my wife and 3 yr old.  The waitress was super nice, walked my daughter over to the deli case to pick out her juice like a big girl.  My daughter loved it! French toast was outstanding!!  We're definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"Service was ok but not inviting. The country fried steak was terrible. We also has the BLT sandwich which was good. The fries and hash browns were plain. They have a cheap lunch menu but I will not return to try it."}
{"text":"My fiance' and I were sat quickly even though it was a busy morning. We have passed this place countless times and finally decided to try it. Breakfast was good, I had huevos rancheros and my fiance' had the chicken fried steak; I wish I had ordered that instead, it was really good. The portion sizes are good too. We will try it again for sure."}
{"text":"I catch my breakfast about 2 times a week here.  The staff is friendly and know what I want before I sit down.  I like the traditional menu and stick with the basics.  That's what I like, they do have other creative things on the menu but I just like my omlete."}
{"text":"My wife and i had breakfast 8/15/14. Saw the tables outside so we could bring the dog. Wife meal was fine. I had the ham and cheese omelette with home fries. Menu has along side the ham and cheese omelette.. onions bell peppers and something else. Told the waitress I have that.  No cheese on my ham and cheese. Told her that it had no cheese. Then she said it was a Denver omelette. Thats when i just ate it. Had just a little home fries. How come they can`t fill the plate. Went there hungry and went home hungry. New place to us....won`t go back. Just want to be fed."}
{"text":"Norms egg cafe is the best the price is right the food is great the service and the people are like family I can't wait until he opens  another so I don't have to go 10 miles everyday to eat."}
{"text":"Good food but HORRIBLE service. We saw a server to take our order, someone ran our food, and that's it. Nobody checked in, no refills. Lousy time we had. Cmon Norm, you can do better."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for well over a year now, I'm a big fan of breakfast places and after coming here I don't want to go anywhere else. They cook the food perfectly, they never over season anything and they're so quick and friendly. Some days they're busy but it's well worth it. It's not overly expensive either. Best breakfast in town."}
{"text":"Lox and creme cheese scramble with hashbrowns, bagel,  orange juice,  cappuccino and iced coffee.   Price was right,  food was AMAZING,  and the staff were incredibly friendly and responsive.   Will come again."}
{"text":"I came here thinking that it would be a great breakfast joint.  Not even close to Egg Works or Cracked Egg quality.  Ordered the chicken fried steak.  The batter on the steak was coming off and the steak was extremely chewy.  The white part of my eggs were raw, still slimy and transparent.  I was only able to eat a 1/4 of my plate.    The only part that was decent was the service.  When the waitress saw that I barely touched my plate she asked what was wrong.  After showing her my plate she offered to take it off the bill.  The service was the only reason why I gave it 2 stars (instead of 1)."}
{"text":"i was bit nervous to read the bad reviews at this place and go having a breakfast with my wife. finally we made our moves and it well worth it. Service is great and really fast like the inside brightness and make you eat more. Food is above the average from other breakfast places and Benedict was right on the money. We had the great food and the best service made our day... Great place and great fiid!!!!"}
{"text":"No wait, no crowds to fight, just friendly fast service, clean & spacious. Coffee was above average. Had the banana nut pancakes that were oversized and tasted great, hubby had the cornedbeef hash, he finished it quick without one crumb on the plate, and my daughter loved her egg & cheese omelet. It's well worth a try and next time we're having the red velvet pancakes! Oh and one more thing, their water in a cup taste filtered along with clean ice, a nice change from the usual tap & ice u get from other restaurants..."}
{"text":"We stopped for breakfast this morning after my wife's blood work.  She was dying for her first coffee of the day, and that was the first thing we got.  Rich and tasty.  For our breakfasts, I had the lemon ricotta pancakes with sautéed apples.  The pancakes very light and they had just enough of lemon flavor with the ricotta so as not to be too lemony.  I used some syrup.  I think if I have this again, I might get the cream cheese icing they use with the red velvet pancakes.  it would be a nice combination.  My wife had a spinach omelette with cheddar cheese.  They offer hash browns or fruit and she got the fruit.  A very nice cup of fresh fruit.  They also give you a choice of toast or bagel.  Having a bagel instead of toast is not a common choice.  She opted for wheat toast.  We enjoyed everything very much.  Norm brought the orders to the table and chatted with us for awhile.  He asked for any suggestions, comments, or complaints.  They have instituted a comment card that's brought with your check.  It's optional, but if you fill it out, they stamp it for a discounted car wash at Fabulous Freddy's - $3 off.  Service was the best.  There weren't many people there, but they were very attentive.  I enjoyed my stop here, and I'll be back."}
{"text":"I like the place, little improvement might help. I ordered corned beef hashed, it was ok, extra corned beef could bring up the value and taste. But overall of the service are great. Definitely I will be back, but they need to improve big time"}
{"text":"I noticed this place has a banner for the best eggs Benedict, so I decided to stop by and try it.  Ordered a cup of coffee and a spinach and tomato Benedict.  Half way through my coffee and over an hour past the time they open I find out norm can't make the sauce, the waitress asks if I would like something else.  No tell norm to get in the kitchen and do his damn job.  Needless to say I'll never be back."}
{"text":"It's a breakfast place with the typical breakfast items. I ordered the regular eggs and bacon dish and it was as expected.   One thing I did notice that they have breakfast specialties like a Chinese breakfast with congee, which I was surprised to see. I wasn't in the mood but was impressed that they have out of the box breakfast options. Next time I will try it out."}
{"text":"Service during breakfast needs to be better. Servers seem inattentive.  Waitress should check on there customers, ask if additional services are needed, more water or coffee should be offered and I should not have to request my bill."}
{"text":"Super yummy local spot!! Everything works here; atmosphere,  service, food.. thoroughly enjoyed myself, definitely coming back.. husband got the huevos rancheros (awesome!) And I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes (fantastic! ).. so happy we tried this spot!"}
{"text":"I have been eyeballing this place for a while, having had some decent hopes for a nice quaint breakfast spot. Unfortunately - the best two parts of this \"experience\" was quick available counter seating and the colored hair of each waitress who scrambled around dazed and confused. We ordered simplistic items that were made incorrectly and stared at dishwashers coming out from their station, driving their used water cups into the ice bin . It saddens me to give this place such a little boost but even my two stars is a probably overly charitable. I wouldn't recommend this spot to any close foodies of mine."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  I wanted blueberry pancakes and I saw the prices and I was like I can't beat that! So we decided to come here on a Saturday morning around 10 am? Anyways, this lady sat a whole bunch of us at the bar which was probably not the best idea since she was also our server. She ended up taking orders from the different groups (there was 4 different groups at the bar) not in the order from which we came in so it probably took a good 15-20 minutes before she took our order.   I ended up with the blueberry pancake special and the husband ordered the loco moco special ($5.99). My breakfast was pretty big, 3 turkey bacon (yes, you can ask for a substitute), 2 eggs, hashbrowns and 3 pancakes. The pancakes were pretty good, the blueberries were fresh but I just wished there was more blueberries in the pancake itself. Hashbrowns were not fully cooked so they didn't taste right. Other than that everything was ok, but I think what makes up for it is the price. Breakfast should not be more than 20 bucks for 2 people.   Service was a bit slow at times, but overall you get what you pay for. I think its decent for what it is."}
{"text":"Enjoy the breakfast menu, but stay away from the lunch features.  The recent saying, \"you don't order speghetti at a Sushi Bar\" applies to this place.  They have a nice variety for a breakfast menu, eggs, pancakes, wafflels, etc., but stay away from things they would serve for a lunch.  My wife was desparate, and ordered the Terriaki Chicken. it was really sad, and the nice young lady serving us, took it back. She then brought out the Chicken Curry, It was even worse. Very salty, and no flavor. She offered to take it off the check, but we're not \"free loaders\", and we learned by our mistake.   Service is very friendly, and good. Price is okay, for Breakfast.   Go here, but stick to what they know best, Breakfast.   I endorse the Lumber Jack Breakfast."}
{"text":"We were on the hunt for breakfast as usual. Stopped here, service was good, fast. Food was good. They had turkey sausage :)."}
{"text":"Great food!  The lox and cream cheese scramble was delicious and I've never seen that on any other breakfast menu before. Only downfall...service was really slow."}
{"text":"Came for the $5 breakfast, but there wasn't any. Food was still good. I ordered something simple; Eggs, potatoes, bacon and toast. My boyfriend ordered the huevos rancheros and I wish I would've ordered that instead. It was filled with flavor.  Our waitress kept checking up on us. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Norm's is okay. I can't say that there's anything that stands out at this restaurant.  It has a locals ambience. I've seen the owner walk around chatting and catching up with his returning customers, which is nice. Norm's cafe offers quite a varied menu. There are Chinese (porridge) Hawaiian (loco mocos), Mexican, and American breakfast options. I have yet to try anything from the lunch menu. What got me in was the poster outside boasting that their eggs Benedict was the best. I got one with spinach and tomatoes and it was just meh. I barely remember eating it about a month ago. I do remember the sauce being bland. Wouldn't get it again. Their super breakfast is a super deal- comes with a lot of food.  I've also had the grilled veggie hash, which was loaded with eggplant, onion, green onion, & potatoes. But not seasoned well at all. I drowned it in hot sauce and ketchup. My boyfriend's loco moco was just that. Rice, patty, & brown gravy. Nothing amazing.   Everything considered, it's not a bad restaurant. It's just not preferred on my list. Portions are right & gets the job done by filling you up. Locals seem to frequent the place, so they must be doing something right!"}
{"text":"Bleh. I'm shocked this place has such good reviews. The food here was not great. I left really disappointed.  I only ordered 2 egg whites scrambled, and they were slimy and undercooked. My friend got the loco moco and it wasn't even put together (meat patty goes on top of rice, topped with egg!) - all of the elements were separate on the plate and there was no gravy. Overall, the food was bland and not even worth the reasonable menu prices.  The only saving grace here was the staff. I feel bad writing this review because I hope it is not a reflection of them. They were all very sweet, attentive, and quick.   I'd urge the management to have a look at your recipes. The food could use a change up."}
{"text":"Do you live on the West side of town? Are you looking for a no-frills joint for breakfast or lunch? Norm's just may be your place.  This restaurant specializes in breakfast items ranging from omelettes to pancakes. Lunch items include HUGE salads, sandwiches, and some specials for $5.99. Dang, you won't break the bank!   I have had - The Cobb Salad - large and in charge. Comes with hardboiled egg, chicken, bacon, ham, feta cheese, and your choice of dressing. Although the salad is large and filling I was missing the green. The salad was made up primarily of iceberg lettuce. Meh.  Curry Chicken Lunch Special - I'm not sure what possessed me to order this, but to put it bluntly: it was not good. The sauce was like gravy, the chicken had a been-frozen-flavor, and the rice was not cooked very well. Just steer clear of this one.  Service is great. Prices are great. It's a decent spot, it's A-OK. Nothing wrong here, nothing really bad, but nothing really great either."}
{"text":"I like Norm's Eggs café because they have breakfast and lunch. They have different lunches you don't normally find at a breakfast café . I've had their Curry and Kalbi for lunch when I came here on two occasions.   The curry and Kalbi are okay . It isn't the best I have had but it will do in a pinch. The curry wasn't spicy enough and the Kalbi was a little tough but I 'm happy the choices were on the menu. This is also the first place I 've been to in Vegas that has fresh coconut  water...right out of the shell!   If you go Monday thru Friday there are typically coupons you can find in mailers which makes the breakfast or lunch a steal!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Norm's since he first opened. The food is fairly priced and very good for filling breakfast food. Lunch is good too. The cafe is a perfect mom and pop shop where you're recognized when you come in and Norm (the owner) is pretty much always there. Working next door I like that I can wander over for a cup of hot chicken noodle soup or orange juice when I'm sick or to get a quick, healthier bite instead of McDonald's down the street."}
{"text":"Great service and great food.  The Owner really wants to make sure your happy worth your meal. My husband said the waitresses are hot!!  Lol!!  Great little Cafe for breakfast or lunch!!"}
{"text":"This place is charming, with its view of the grill, and it's plethora of waiters/waitresses, Norm's feels like a hometown breakfast joint. I ordered the 8 oz sirloin steak and sunny side up eggs, my boyfriend ordered chocolate chip pancakes with a side of sausage and home fries. We both also ordered iced coffees, hazelnut for me, vanilla for him. We both ordered refills, I stated 'another hazelnut iced coffee, please?,  my boyfriend said' can I get another iced coffee?' they brought me hazelnut both times, they brought him regular, so when he asked again, he made sure to say vanilla, he still got regular. While the food was amazing, the service wasn't as good as I thought it would be, we were helped by several different waiters and waitresses, and they would always come back and ask us again what we ordered. I got tired of repeating myself.   If you want great food, I definitely recommend. The four stars are a testament to that. I just won't be back based on the service."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast for first time with my son. Service was good. Food was 7 out of 10 at best. My reason for two stars was that my 6 year-old ordered milk with his breakfast. It was filled about 3/4 of the way full in a small kids cup. When I asked for refills, the waitress said no refills on milk but had no problem charging us $2.25 for that measly amount. Pathetic, considering I was planning to purchase a $40 gift certificate before I left. After that experience, doubt we will even be back."}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge 14' * 2/100  Maybe it'd be a good idea to modify my new years resolution and add 'try more breakfast places' because I can't bear the thought of having missed this & many other brekkie gems all these years. Plus, it gives me a good excuse to bike it up and hit Desert Breeze Park for a walk before I head here, all famished!  My mom, who raised me on traditional values, has never been one to eat out for breakfast. The whole logic of which has mainly been 'if we can make our own breakfast, why pay a fortune just to have someone else make the same thing?' but then again, for someone who's always on the lookout for something new, I convinced her to try the Red Velvet Pancakes at Norms Eggs with me. Now she's absolutely spellbound and pulled ME out of bed yesterday to head there!   What I love most about the cafe is the warm smiles that greet us every time we go through the doors. Mommy, too, found our server, Teresa, very endearing. We would be checked up on every so often during our meal and for awhile, Teresa paused for a delightful conversation with us. We shared a short stack of red velvet pancakes with a drizzle of light cream cheese syrup and got a pair of sunnyside-up eggs, house fries & toast from the breakfast special. Prices are very reasonable, if not cheap. We paid only about $11 for our meal and left carbo-loaded for the day."}
{"text":"Been coming here for about 2 years . They always give me great service , and the food here is delicious !!! Lumberjack is the go to food when I come here. It consists of biscuits sausage egg bacon and gravy with a side of fruit or potatoes ! Everyone is friendly here , I love the atmosphere . It's not too crazy . Kid friendly spot."}
{"text":"During a recent trip to New York, one of the things that I enjoyed almost everyday there was having smoked salmon/lox for breakfast.  It was available everywhere we had breakfast and brunch, and surprisingly that has been one of the things I miss since coming back home.  Doing a quick search for breakfast places that served lox, Norm's Eggs Cafe came up.  With salmon on my mind, I ordered the Lox and Cream Cheese Scramble.  It comes with a choice of toast or bagel, and hash browns or fruit.  I opted for rye toast and hash browns.  The scramble comes out exactly as you would envision, lots of salmon in every bite and quite the generous portion of cream cheese mixed in.  After finishing my meal, everything was cleaned off the plate except for the cream cheese; there was that much mixed in!  The salmon had a great smoked flavor and was also portioned generously.  Every bite had salmon, they did not skimp on it.    Hash browns and toast were standard fare.  Potatoes were nice and crispy on top and softer on the bottom layer, and pleasantly not soaked in grease.  The toast was toast, can't go wrong with that!  The menu did state that the scramble was made with three eggs, but to me the portion seemed a bit small.  Maybe I'm used to the heaping portions served at other restaurants, but the entree size here had me wishing for more.  Overall a nice spot to grab breakfast, and definitely not as crowded as other breakfast options during the weekend.  I'll be back for the salmon scramble!"}
{"text":"Food is great! Service is even better. I am always satisfied with my experience each time I come here, and prices are extremely reasonable. Good job Norm!"}
{"text":"Came here because it was conveniently located in the same shopping center I was in. This breakfast place is really mompop-shop. I ordered to go. The receptionist was nice taking my order and told me to come in in 15 minutes. When I walked in I was greeted by the nice busy staff. The entire restaurant was full of people! I would recommend if you are in the area. They have lots of breakfast/brunch options. I loved their pancakes with eggs and bacon!"}
{"text":"Woke up early one Saturday, 10:00am, and was searching for a new place for some breakfast eats and happened upon this place. Norm's Eggs Cafe has been open for a little over 2 weeks and looks to be a solid place for some good breakfast eats.  I needed something hearty so I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and a side of Bacon. It was great. The steak was nice and tender with a very tasty breading and a very nice white gravy which I liked very much, which is a first for me. Most of the time I just find it a nuisance but this was filled with peppery goodness.  The entre came with 2 eggs, choice of sides, and a biscuit covered in that awesome gravy. Both done exactly the way I ordered them, soooo happy now.  The Bacon was in the Goldilocks area for me, not too crispy yet not too soft, juuust right. Oh yeah today is gonna be a good day.  The service was very fast and friendly and the chefs look like they take pride in what they are sending out and all this leads to one great breakfast joint that I will be frequenting, whenever I get up early enough for breakfast. And they have wifi."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Norm's Eggs restaurant ...... delicious  and very warm and friendly.  If you want wholesome comfort food go to Norm's  .  I had tender ox tails with tomato base gravy over rice my husband had crispy Fish n Chips .  Can't wait to try another dish the next time we return to Vegas."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  The staff is wonderfull, as for the negative reviews.  Well norm only uses fresh ingredients and greatness takes time.  This is great food not fast food."}
{"text":"Came in today for breakfast. Our waiter was really friendly and our food came out quick. I had the eggs Benedict it was great with the potatoes my friend had the red velvet pancakes they were huge enough for 2 people to share. Overall I liked everything and the atmosphere was really chill. Id recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"Sat for 10 minutes while other tables the came in after us got served. Finally just walked out. 3 slow ass waitresses never even asled if we wanted water. It was like we were invisible. Never again"}
{"text":"A solid 2. Food was meh, all four of us agreed, and the vast selection from Asian, to Greek, to Amerian didn't make up for it.  My daughter asked for a refill and the waitress said \" A new one? Or do you want it in the same cup?\". Uh......that's a stumper there, Sunshine.  No wait, but by the time we were done every table was full.  My Huevous Ranchero was a very Americanized, bland canned tasting sauce, Girlfriends Eggs and Hamburger Patty with Gravy tasted like powdered store stuff. Daughters Pancakes were good, but not hot. Mom ordered the same as me, lack of impressed just like mine.  The cook has a full beard with no hairnet, and scratched at it several times. Ew.  Won't go back unless someone really craves it, unless I run through for a Thai Tea, which can be hard to find, and I love."}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place has so many good ratings - even from people with many reviews.  I've driven by here many times and knew from my Yelp app it had good ratings.  However, I was a little hesitant to come here because most of the people whose reviews I follow and deem reliable did not give this place a good rating.  Should have listened to them.    Basically, the food is not very good.  It's NOT bad...but it's not even average for a breakfast place.  I had country fried steak and eggs.  The eggs were too runny (ordered over medium) and the CFS was just bad.  Bland, tough, and the gravy served on top was really thick and useless.  It was small, too.  Came with a biscuit -  bland, chewy, and dense.    I'm not accusing the folks who run Norms of successfully manipulating people into giving it a high rating.  I have no proof of that.  But, yeah, that's what they did.  I'd bet plenty of dough on it.  Good for them, I guess.  There's literally 30+ places within 10 minute drive from here that are loads better for breakfast.  And the price isn't really cheap, either.  Looks like they raised prices above what they used to be.  I really feel like giving this 1 star for the fact that so many reviews from before were not accurate or biased.  But I don't know for sure so I'll give it a deuce."}
{"text":"This place is okay. I would come back again if I was nearby and needed a decent breakfast. The food was not anything spectacular, but it got the job done. I would have typically rated this place a three star, but gave them a one star bump for the service. The servers and staff at this place are great. They were full and had no tables available inside. I told them we would wait, but then they were like, hey we can move a table inside to seat you (the restaurant was not full of tables, so this would not have been a fire or code issue). They moved the table inside and allowed my son and I to enjoy breakfast without a wait. Kudos to the staff here for making it a great experience."}
{"text":"Surprising good...the machaca burrito was good my wife had I believe country steak and eggs...don't remember exactly...but what do remember was the ricotta lemon pancake...but not in a good way sorry that was the only thing not crazy for...the Raider waitress was AWESOME!!!  Not just because she is Raider family but she was on point with the service... The only thing I would add...put some hash browns in the breakfast burrito"}
{"text":"Wanted to eat breakfast and this was the next choice since my other place was packed. I ordered the steak and eggs with a side of red velvet pancakes. Steak was plain tasting and I had to use A1 steak sauce. A ok food. But average I would say."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch while we waited for DMV to text us. I had a BLT & my grandie had the BBQ burger. It was a generous portions.  Service was friendly. Bathroom was clean which is important to me. Back to the food.  French fries are thin & very tasty. My bacon was crisp & yummy. Grandie loved her burger. We will be back to try the breakfast menu.  Prices are reasonable."}

{"text":"I had been here a few times.  Twice with my boyfriend, and once with my step dad.  One out of two times I had a very good experience.  The simple little restaurant wasn't overly decorated and was just simple.  It's definitely how I like it.  There is a lot of lighting and has an open feeling to it.  The menu is also above the cashier and you're also given one when seated.  Immediately when entering the restaurant, we were greeted by the servers and owner with happy smiles.  It gives a lasting impression.  The first time I came here I ordered Corned Beef Hash which is prepared with diced corned beef, potatoes, and onions served with eggs, and toast.  With this order, I also asked for a side of rice.  When I got home to dig in to my breakfast, I was disappointed because I had made sure to ask for jelly and butter and ketchup.  There was none in my to go bag.  There's no failure to corned beef hash especially when eaten with rice.  So, the tastes and flavors were expected and nothing special to it.    The second time I came here was with my step dad and ate in the restaurant with him.  I ordered the Huevos Rancheros prepared with corn tortillas layered with beans, two fried eggs, and topped with melted cheese and ranchero sauce.  This was phenomenal.  The crunch of the corn tortilla mixed with the other ingredients together was like heaven in my mouth.  when adding the salsa, it makes it even better.  I would come back for this over and over again.  The third time I was here was just this past Sunday with my boyfriend.  I ordered Steak and Eggs, an 8oz. sirloin steak served with two eggs, and fruit, and toast.  I had asked for medium steak with pink in the middle and over medium eggs.  When ordering eggs, it's very rare I get them ever right.  Like all the other restaurants, I got over easy eggs which ran all over my plate.  I think I'm going to have to ask for over hard to get over medium next time around.  As for my steak, it was well done.  The texture of the steak was very rubbery and chewy.  I might as well have bought beef jerky.  My boyfriend asked for scrambled eggs, sausages, bacon, potato hash, and toast.  He said his eggs had a weird taste to them, the potato hash was bland and needed seasoning.  He barely touched his bacon but found the sausages very tasty.  The great thing I can say about this little mom and pop breakfast place is their servers.  They're very knowledgeable, attentive, and courteous.  When I ask them what they recommend, they are quick to give me one.  Thus knowing what the food taste like is apparent and that's very important.  On Sunday, when our server asked us how our food was, I couldn't hold it in and just had to tell him my experience.  I was expecting something of a defensive reaction but instead, he suggested he gave us a discount.  I have a hard time being a douche about it because to me, I ordered the food and ate some of it.  So, I should still pay for it, unless it was that disgusting.  In this case, it wasn't at that point.  He also suggested we wrote in their comment card, which we did.  I was delighted our server was willing to hear our opinion and was ready to make sure it doesn't happen again in future.  I was tossing back and forth on whether I should give two stars or three stars.  The only reason why I chose to give three stars is because their service was very exceptional.  The food just needs a little more love to it."}
{"text":"Shucks, Norm, I think we may have caught you on a bad day. We heard from a waitress that there was a new cook in the kitchen, and perhaps our experience was a byproduct of this.   The good: Breakfast is cheap. The bill for two was a little over $13.   However, starting with the menu, the cafe did not impress us on a Saturday morning. I am an omelet eater, and the omelet selection was limited to very average ingredients: spinach, mushroom, ham, bacon, green peppers and the like. Call me spoiled, but I really love to see fancy-named omelets with inventive twists. I decided to go with the Veggie. It took over 30-minutes to receive our order, and the food we received was standard fare. The omelet was on the smaller side, and the ingredients were not generous enough. It tasted like well-done eggs, not like a bounty of veggies and cheese. The hashbrowns were simply hashbrowns.   The limited selection (although I am intrigued by their lunch time curry), food quality and slow execution left us disappointed. Maybe the secret is to stick to the pancakes!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Norm's Eggs Cafe with my family. It was my husband's idea and we had checked out the menu before actually stepping foot into the place. The menu looked good and the prices were reasonable, so we went for it. Unfortunately, the food wasn't that great. My husband's Chicken Curry was slightly bland and the rice was tough and sticky. My Loco Moco lacked flavor, the overhard egg was runny in the middle and the hamburger was hard and crunchy. The kids were satisfied with their Denver Omelettes, Cheese Omelet and Chicken Caesar Wrap. But, the kicker was that soft drinks were served by the can with a glass full of ice at 1.25 each. I had a case of pop in the car, and I was so tempted to tell the kids if they wanted refills, they better go to the car. This will probably be my last visit. I do have one positive thing, the coffee was pretty good."}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much from the outside but daaaaaang. They have the sweetest waitresses. They go out their ways to make sure your not dying of a refill or needing anything. The food was so good! Great portions. Great price. Nice area. Another staple when we visit Vegas! Thanks y'all"}
{"text":"Mom and pop shop. The food was okay. I came here to meet with a few friends during breakfast. I ordered a couple of items but I thought they tasted okay, nothing to rave about. The hash brown potatoes tasted a little bit off and the sunny side up eggs were a bit too well done.  Their salad looks a bit sad as well. Maybe this is just not the place for me."}
{"text":"Items Selected: Red Velvet Pancakes Cinnamon Swirl French Toast Banana Nut Pancakes  Located on South Durango and open from 6am until 3pm seven days a week Norm's Eggs Café had long been on my breakfast 'to-do' list and with a morning half-marathon of miles already under my feet it was just after the small storefront opened that I arrived on Saturday, a smiley young server setting tables while Norm himself manned the oven and stove.  Every bit the quaint space its name would imply with exposed brick, worn wood, and a kitchen-side bar wrapped around a well-culled menu of classics from breakfast and lunch it was admittedly with carbs on my mind that I approached an order and eschewing a few interesting specials in favor of a trio of griddled goods the results were mostly what one would expect - as tasty and well made as what a skilled home cook could make but without all the prep-work and cleanup hassles involved.  Beginning first with French Toast before progressing to pancakes I will simply say that for my tastes the former was a bit too 'bready' but more than making up for it were the flapjacks, both styles proving delightful with unexpected levels of fluffiness despite thinly spread batter and each well paired with subtly sweetened cream cheese frosting flooding the red velvet while pockets of fresh banana dotted the nut-strewn buttermilk, neither really necessitating a bit of the unfortunately artificial maple syrup...though with an out-the-door tab under $20 I'm not sure it would be fair to expect the real deal."}
{"text":"Relatively clean environment. Friendly service. Fair enough prices. Food tastes great.   Menu satisfies an \"American\" breakfast and lunch. A good selection of various cravings. Seating appears fairly limited; a dozen tables and counter/bar. Portions are good, not too little nor too much.   Recommended to anyone seeking a simple yet well prepared breakfast or lunch. I had the classic eggs benedict, and my wife enjoyed the crab cake eggs benedict + French onion soup."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I last reviewed Norm's two years ago. This is a no frills, no fluff, good place to eat at exceptional value. Their breakfasts are spot on with good portions and quality. Most noticeably are their eclectic fruit options...half papayas, fresh coconut! Really? In Vegas! Kudos!"}
{"text":"Friendly, hot, girl-next-door waitresses. Good food at reasonable prices (lunch under $10 and not a taco or hamburger!). Relaxing atmosphere.   Go there now."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe that is close to home and was very good!  My husband and I decided to try it for breakfast, we had heard about their version of red velvet pancakes and thought it might be good.  The service was great, but then there was only one other table.  We got the red velvet pancakes and the lemon ricotta pancakes.  I love the idea of a sweet cream cheese frosting.  I do agree with my husband, the lemon ricotta needed a little bit more lemon flavor but overall, it was good.  The menu is simple and has some interesting lunch items.  I think it's worth a trip back to check it out."}
{"text":"Food is always great and service is always friendly.  I love the steak oh la la.  Food is pretty fast.  Place is small and very clean."}
{"text":"If I could I would this place 1/2 a star, is was disgusting.  I ordered the vegetable hash, I asked for no eggplant and egg whites, my whole plate was nothing but eggplant,  and everything was wet. When the server came to clear the table he reached over me while I was eating and almost stuck his hand in my mouth. Every person that ordered food with us was disappointed.  Never will I eat here again."}
{"text":"Great food and service the lemon ricotta pancakes are awesome"}
{"text":"The worst. The service was bad, the coffee was terrible. The \"fresh fruit\" was still frozen. Eggs were cold and runny and they even found a way to ruin the bacon. The only thing they got right was the bill. I never write yelp reviews. Ever. This place made me feel it was necessary. Sorry Norm."}
{"text":"The rating is accurate on this place. Service was pretty friendly. The kitchen is slow. We were the last to be served. The food was ok, no better than what you would get at a casino, minus the smoke."}
{"text":"Norm... I must be Frank.  Sometimes, if I have high expectations for a place I do tend to be hypercritical.  Of course, like most reviews this is an assessment of weighted compensating factors.  It wasn't bad but I was expecting more.  If you are a breakfast place only - breakfast better be good!  The place inside is more like a sandwich shop.  It is plain - not quite stark - but close.  I want a breakfast place to be warm and inviting.  If it is not warm and inviting, then I want bistro style... something.  There was literally no atmosphere here.  The service was okay.  The kid was trying hard but he seemed uncomfortable.  I always thought serving tables at a breakfast place required zero talent but I realized that there is some level of ability to do this.    The Food; chicken fried steak, basted eggs, taters.  The chicken fried steak was tough.  It was okay to eat but it was tough and it lacked seasoning.  The basted eggs were sub par - I want NO color on my basted eggs!  Turn the heat down.  The taters were good.  The portions and the prices were good - some value here.  The chicken fried steak was supposed to come with biscuits, but they were out.  I actually didn't mind this, because it was later in the day which tells me they make the biscuits fresh every day.   I do appreciate the fact that this place was trying to be a quality homemade type of breakfast place.  This does cary weight in my review.  I would go back, for a second chance.  I just wanted more.     ** side note.  I saw the owner leave.  He got in his car that was parked right up front.  I hate that.  Why would you tie up a customer's parking spot?  Oy-veh!"}
{"text":"Love this Lil gem.  Great food and outstanding service.   I love the Italian omlete and iced coffee.  Norm is always there and super friendly.  Open early morning, and worth a try. I frequent this place so I may see you there."}
{"text":"Norm's has become my go to breakfast joint in Summerlin. The food is good, service is good, good is ample and wifi is free and fast.   The bread/toast is excellent and may be my favorite part of the meal when I order eggs. The wheat pancakes are probably my favorite thing on the menu."}
{"text":"Wonderful food!! Very friendly staff!! Highly recommend it! Well worth the drive even if your coming from Boulder city. Thanks Norms!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Norm's on Saturday for lunch. I had the roast beef pannini it was great I loved it 5 stars!  However I went back yesterday for breakfast and got the chicken fried steak hands down the most disgusting thing I ever ate. The biscuit was so hard it would like a brick even the waitress couldn't believe it. That being said without me even asking they took it off the bill. Because lunch was so excellent on Saturday I might try this place one more time."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place quite often and wondered how the food was. My husband and I decided to stop in for breakfast the other morning. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted right away and were told to sit down at any table. It's a small cafe, but very clean and the employees were friendly.  I ordered the corned beef hash, which was pretty horrible. Most of it was burnt and it just did not taste good overall. Honestly, buying corned beef hash in a can from the grocery store and making it myself would have been more delicious! After I took a few bites and stopped, our server came back with a plate of hash browns and said \"sorry, the cook forgot to put this underneath your corned beef hash.\" I don't know how you can screw up hash browns, but they were very bland, even with a lot of ketchup! My meal was also supposed to come with a side of fruit, but I never got it. Oh boy, strike 3!  My husband ordered the loco moco and said it was alright. He was disappointed because it was supposed to come with rice, but instead they put hash browns!? If they didn't have rice available for some reason, they should at least let us know!   Our bill was $14, which wasn't bad. But I thought the food was just horrible. I also think they need to be more organized to avoid all the careless mistakes they have been making. Sorry Norm, I won't be back!"}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from me and I never tried it until today. Service was great and everyone was very friendly. Food was great especially the lemon ricotta pancakes. Will go again for sure."}
{"text":"Such a good place (I'm from California) came looking for a good breakfast and was pleasantly surprised. Would recommend!"}
