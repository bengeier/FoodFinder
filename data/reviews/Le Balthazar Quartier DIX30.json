{"text":"Nice beer list, but they are out of stock on a few of them at any given time. Location is convenient, food is ok. All and all its a good place to have drinks and talk with friends. Much better then the public house. Service is \"ok\" as well nothing to wright home about."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but this experience was such a disappointment that it motivates me
Great location and terrace and I was super thirsty for a beer but took 30 minutes to get served then got a new waiter for no reason so had to start over 
Ordered wings and stressed Extra well done but they were so raw and mushy and disgusting that could not eat them
My wife ordered poutine and soo salty also could not eat it
When complained to waiter just got a \" sorry\"
Overall would go for the beer but since the service is so bad it will not wash away the bad taste in my mouth"}
{"text":"The worst service. We have been here at least seven times. We come back out of convenience, it is close to home and the terrasse is great, with a good selection of beer. But be prepared for a staff that regularly ignores your needs and your meal and beer to take a really long time. Even when it is completely empty. The wait staff is generally more interested in chit chatting with each other than taking your order....While Mile Public House is an alternative, their terrasse is small and often packed and the beer selection is limited...We are hoping someone will give this place competition soon!"}
{"text":"Malheureusement je dois dire de ce restaurant que le service est pitoyable et l'endroit est beaucoup trop bruyant. La qualité des assiettes ne justifie aucunement la prix élevés. 
Semble que le resto se spécialise dans les bières,mais j'avoue avoir vu et bu mieux. 
Un endroit que je ne risque pas de remettre les pieds de sitôt. 

Unfortunately I have to say the service of this restaurant is awful and the place is too noisy. The quality of the plates does not justify the high prices.
Seems the restaurant is specialized in beers, but I confess having seen and drank better.
A place I will not go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great place to try a variety of local Quebec micros but WAY overpriced. $8.50 for a pint that is $6 at their proper establishments. Average food menu that's paired to the beer that they serve. Hit or miss on that count. Better than going to 3 Brasseurs... OK mega mall box store atmosphere. Helpful staff that will suggest their favourites as long as you don't ask them what the name of the beer they're serving.  Also they have screw top wines on display in their contrived wine cellar."}
{"text":"Grosse déception. L'endroit a du potentiel mais malheureusement le service trèd moyen à gâché l'expérience. Nous étions laissé à nous même et c'était très long avant d'avoir nos plats. Nous étions déçu aussi car il n'y avait plus de soupe à l'oignon :("}
{"text":"Such horrible services, I went there for lunch and was promptly seated, but I had to wait for over 20 minutes to even pass my order.
The food came another 20 minutes later with the waiter forgetting my beer, but I could not find him anywhere as he was busy talking to a female colleague.
All in all never going back"}
{"text":"Soulless food. That's what came to my mind while I was eating there. Let me explain.

I'm used to eat at restaurants where the cook actually puts a bit of his passion and style into the food. It doesn't need to be a great restaurant for that to happen... but everything I ate at Balthazar was bland and subpar. 

I ordered a Spinach dip and a some ribs and want3d to try their beer combo. Most (or maybe all the) dish have a suggested beer to accompany the plate. My wife ordered some Squid General Taos and some fish and chips. I went the safe route, she chose to be a bit adventurous...

First off, they didn't have any of the beers that was matching my dishes... not even the one matching the ribs (which I guess must be popular). Then comes the taste. Or lack of... my spinach dip was alright. Nothing fancy. As for my ribs, I'm pretty sure I bought better ribs at Provigo, in the frozen isle... and for 22$, I would have thought they would give me a full rack. Nope, just an half... the sides were some veggies (which were ok) and some chips, fine slices of potatoes over fried that tasted like the bottom of a fryer... yum yum.

As for my wife, her General Tao Squids were mushy in texture, as if there were reheated... and her fish tasted ultra bland. No salt or seasoning. The fries tasted like regular frozen fries. 

That's the kind of food you get when the cook is just following a recipe and don't care to bring anything to his plates... soulless. 

Will I come back? I'll let you guess..."}
{"text":"Resto merdique, service de merde!!!!
Dommage car c'est un bel endroit mais tout est en fonction de $$$. Le client n'est pas un client mais un gros signe de $ sur patte. 
Jamais je ne retournerais la! Perdez pas votre temps et surtout pas votre argent dans cet endroit de"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. The atmosphere and staff were very nice and the service was good. Wide selection of beers on tap (including local micro brews). Very large inside and outside options for seating."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had been wanting to try this place for quite sometime once we heard about it, so last night, for our anniversary, we decided to go. Had a 6pm reservation, as we were seeing a movie at 7:40pm. 
The restaurant was not busy at all at this time, yet we were seated in a long booth connected to where a family of 5 were sitting, so we were directly next to them, almost touching elbows, when there were about 30 other tables available in that section. On top of that, we were by a window and the sun was right in my boyfriend's face. So we asked to change seats.
We got our new table, much better, but it took another 25 minutes for a waitress to come see us. We asked to try the samplers of beer, advertised at 4 x 4 oz beers for $8.00. We were told that they don't do that in the evenings on weekends. 
We ordered our pints and food. Pork in pastry appetizer to share, $13 for 3 small pastry, not even 4 so each person can have 2. Then the meal, I had fish and chips which was bland and tasteless, and wild boar ribs were not wild, did not have a gamey taste or texture. 
On top of all this, the appetizer plates that were on the table were filthy.
All in all, not a great experience at all. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I have to say service is horrible at this location. The hostesses don't know what they are doing. We were told to leave a cell phone number and we would be contacted when a table became available in the terasse. This was not the case- instead when I asked the server walking by- she snapped a me and replied I will get my text when my table becomes available. Then why were people in line after us getting tables on the terasse before we did? I contacted another server and she asked me if we were going to order food. After responding yes-we were then given  table on the terasse immediately.

The food quality was poor. The duck confit grilled cheese had a high bread to duck ratio although the chips were good. The additional fish and chips we ordered came with fries that were all scraps you get at the bottom of a bag that when you join together form a full french fry. The charcuterie plate was weak-the only highlight being the paprika/lemon goat cheese.

I like the beer and live music- but not enough to come back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was good even if the music was very loud to the point of screaming to be heard on the other side of the table. Music was not my style, so I do not know if it was good but for me repeating the same drum beat for 20 minutes is not very good.

The beer was good and the selection was great. As for the food, wow that was bad! My wife took the onion soup and she told me it was the worse she ever had. In all fairness the spinach dip was not bad, just ordinary. As for me, I took the trio of tartar. They were bland and extremely cold, right out of the fridge. It was evident that they were prepared in advance and kept in the fridge. Normally a tartar should be served to almost room temperature, just fresh not icy cold.

Since the prices are much too high for the quality I will not be back."}
{"text":"Went to have beer with buddy's there was no room at the bar so they said we could have a table. When we sat down they told use if we don't get food we can not have the table worst management ever . So went to a other bar and spent Are money well never go back ."}
{"text":"Super bonne ambiance. Superbe belle terrasse qui vous permettra de bien zyeuter les passants.

Très grande salle à manger aussi on s'entend. Parfait pour party ou autre.

Très bonne sélection de bières, car c'est ça leur spécialité! Je conseille la bière blanche aux trois thés. Sinon, vous pouvez demander à leurs bièreologues!"}
{"text":"Ce soir j'ai mangé les trois pires tartares que j'ai mangé à vie. C'était comme si le cuisinier avait échappé sa salière dans mon plat. La bière est bonne, si vous choisissez la bonne compagnie.... Le service en bon mais si vous désirer bien manger je vous le déconseille fortement !"}
{"text":"Le restaurant, situé dans le quartier commercial de DIX30, se situe à l'étage d'un bâtiment moderne et entretenu, tout comme le reste du quartier. Il est grand, spacieux, et le seul bémol que j'y mettrai est que la lumière est extrêmement tamisé, ce qui fait qu'on y voit pas très bien, et pour lire un menu, c'est jamais facile. Ceci étant dit, la carte est bien et variée, les poutines sont très bonnes, les burgers délicieux, et les salades également. C'est une micro-brasserie, et leurs bières sont délicieuses. Le service est correct, les serveurs sont polis, aimables et efficaces. Je dirai que le restaurant est un peu cher au premier abord, mais au vu des quantités, c'est finalement très raisonnable. La grande poutine est a 12$ et m'a fait deux repas. Je conseille"}
{"text":"Impressive microbrew selection on tap with a few Balthazar signatured items.

Wish their tempting pub style menu was delivering on food expectation... Sad tasting burgers not worthy of good basket of fries.

Let me update this review if I ever venture back for a premium poutine."}
{"text":"Bel endroit pour un événement! C'est très grand et le menu est très varié (avec un gros groupe, tout le monde y trouve son compte). La nourriture est bonne et les prix sont corrects.
J'ai choisi le Burger de Bison et il était délicieux! Mon chum a choisi le Burger Balthazar et il était bon, mais sans plus. La poutine est très bonne aussi. C'est une bonne place, mais je ne dirais pas un incontournable..."}
{"text":"This should have been a 5 star review. 

In the middle of the dix30 huge shopping centre, this is a paradise for beer aficionados. 
50 beers on tap. 100 beers from quebec from 22 different breweries. 
You'll find the perfect beer, for a perfect sunny afternoon on the really nice terraces upstairs. 

They have food and I have one thing to say : best pulled pork Poutine I tried so far. This is it, I said it. This was the best one. Pulled pork was juicy and tasty, great. 
I actually stole some from my partner because, and this was the only problem during this night out : the service. 

Don't get me wrong, friendly service, enthusiast waitress, overall nice staff. 

But. 

There's always a but. 

While waiting for a beer, twice another waiter asked if we ordered this or that. We didn't. 
The Poutine arrived. I waited for my burger. 
We finished the Poutine. I was still waiting for my burger. 
I ordered another beer. It came 5mn later and I was about to give up on my burger. But it finally arrived. Maybe 20mn after my partner finished her meal. Not great. 

I asked for mayo : Heinz mayo pack like in cafeteria. For a 16$ burger : not great. 
Burger and fries were really good though. Good homemade mayo is ALWAYS a very big detail. Take note restaurant and bar owners. 



Overall a success. It was game night and it's a huge place so I can understand the difficulties but this is something they could work on. 

But I will definitely go back, you can't say no to 50 different great local breweries beer."}
{"text":"Troisième visites dans ce restaurant et je n'ai pas été déçu. Oui la musique est forte mais pour ma part je n'ai pas trouvé ça dérangeant. Pour un samedi soir, c'est exactement ce que nous voulions. Il y a une grande variété de bières et la serveuse savait très bien nous les recommander. Le prix pour les bières n'est pas cher du tout, le prix pour les plats pourraient être un peu moins cher. Grande terrasse, service agréable, temps d'attente convenable. Ils prennent les réservations en ligne ce qui est toujours un plus selon moi. Nous avons mangé une bavette de boeuf et un tartare de boeuf. La cuisson de la bavette n'était pas tout a fait a points mais autre que ça tout était très bien."}
