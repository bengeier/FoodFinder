{"text":"Food here was great! I got the chicken breast, vegetables and garden salad. My date got BBQ chicken, rice & potatoes. Everything was perfect.   The restaurant was a little cold. & not too much seating inside. Large patio - must be so nice in the summer. Peri peri sauce tasted and smelled a little like paint but you don't need it anyway - the chicken is great without it! Lol"}
{"text":"New place for Portuguese chicken and all types of BBQ.  I'm in love with the grilled chicken salad and the hot sauce is to die for.  My new Portuguese chicken spot"}
{"text":"This place is now closed.  I loved this place but, sadly, they closed in November 2015. A Greek restaurant is now in their spot."}
{"text":"Awesome food, family run business yet so organized..not sure what to recommend steak, shrimp..definitel chicken..its all great stuff..  Very affordable and filling..love it..  Oh and Its beyond clean !  Huge outdoor patio, bigscreen inside as well!"}
{"text":"Great chicken and decent side dishes that comes with. But the Clams were the biggest waste of money. It was basically salty empty shells that took almost an hour to get to the table.   I will probably only go back for take-outs...and chickens only, as the guy doesn't seem to know how to run the restaurant efficiently. We felt very neglected during the whole dining experience."}
{"text":"I wanted to try for so long and got really excited after reading a couple reviews on here but I was sadly disappointed  I asked for spicy, I am not sure if they forgot or if that was their spicy but I was not happy with that, their piri piri needs to be replaced as well  This place is within walking distance and I will never return due to lack of quality and being blessed with superior options within driving distance"}
{"text":"Sat at the patio. Service was average. The best thing there was the hot sauce. Ordered the half chicken. It was the same as any run-of-the-mill chicken from a grocery store. The potatoes were good however very oily. Fries were OK. Grandma ordered the baked cod which was very hard and chewy on the outside and also very oily. The portion size was large though. Her side of vegetables were straight out of the freezer. MIL ordered the salmon. It tasted bland and also oily. That is a trend here."}
{"text":"New place in Vaughan.  Has take out and sit down.  We had the chicken was very good. They were making a seafood platter and it looking great.  Looks like a must try."}
{"text":"Toronto Greek Grill Express has now replaced this restaurant.  It is very clean and great fresh food along with great service.  Goodbye Mr. GREEK EXPRESS!  This place is better and doesn't screw my order up."}
{"text":"Located at the corner of Vellore Woods Blvd and Rutherford Rd, we've passed by this restaurant many times while it was under construction. Only open for about a week, I'm so glad it's in the neighbourhood as the food was incredible.  As with any new place, they've got a few things to iron out, but the food quality will ensure their success.  Inside seating is small (might be problematic in the winter) but they have a fairly large patio, so that's where our group of 4 sat last night. We ordered:  Appetizer - calamari - I don't eat this dish but the other 3 said it was very garlicky but excellent Main course: 2 of us had Chicken Kebobs....skewered chicken with onions and peppers, with rice and salad. Excellent flavours...huge portion sizes. 1 person had Tiger Prawns - although they came with the heads on (she was warned of this when ordering) she said it was excellent..although all you get is the shrimp. I person had fish fillets - excellent as well. Hers came with rice and potatoes. Make sure to ask for their home made peri peri sauce...sweet with a heat that builds. Dinner for 4, with 2 draft beers and 2 diet Pepsi, came to just over $113. Great price as portion sizes were huge.  We'll definitely be going back. Very friendly staff."}
