{"text":"Always looking for a place to eat late night, and I usually go elsewhere in Scarborough in my area, but fortunately Bistro Manila was a place open late night. I always mistaken it as just a bar place, but its actually a karaoke filipino cuisine. This place has the bar feel and a small stage for karaoke...On to the food!  Ordered the eggplant with soy sauce and scrambled eggs...This is quite nice especially since it has eggplant in it. Not usual to try this, but its tasty in an omelette form.  2nd dish: Grilled chicken which is boneless marinated in in soy sauce and spices...Its quite tender and tasty and the flavour taste well.  3rd dish: Sizzling Sisig which is pork with onion and spices... This dish was the 'HIT' of the night. It comes in a sizzling hot plate with a sunny side egg on it. The pork is actually crispy like pork skin which is a nice bite. This is actually a very enjoyable dish and I would come back just to eat this dish!  Fortunately this is close to me, so whenever I wanna have some nice filipino cuisine, I drop by here instead of the usual 'Perfect' or 'Boston Steak House'..."}
{"text":"I've never had Filipino food before so I came here and decided to try menu items from their specialty section. I also had the Sizzling Sisig and the marinated boneless chicken. I have absolutely no spice tolerance so I had it ordered as non spicy but I'd say the sizzling sisig was definitely a hit! Definitely order up some rice to eat with this. As for the boneless chicken, it wasn't really that great and was a miss. Yes, the chicken was very juicy but it was also very burned at the same time. There would be spots on the chicken was just plain black from being burned.  The place can also be very loud, especially if you end up going on a night where there's a live band. I ended up going on one of those nights and had to pay a $5 cover charge. The live music is nice but I do think they could have turned down the music as it was hard to hear any conversation even if you sat beside the person."}
{"text":"My family and I were craving for sisig and halo halo. But we ordered other food as well.  Spices on the pork sisig was spot on and was crunchy.however we're very disappointed since it was all just pork fat - it NEEDS meat!!!  We didn't pay $15 for a plate of pure fat.   Bangus  sisig was okay.    Pancit miki was good.   Halo halo was good.  Not enough ingredients though.  There was live band on  Saturday which we did not know about. Seems fun for a group.   Not sure if we'll come back"}
{"text":"The best sizzling sisig you will ever try in Toronto! Better than any high end Filipino restaurants in GTA."}
{"text":"I've never had Filipino food before so I was very curious to try out some dishes. My boyfriend took me to Bistro Manila and I let him do the ordering. We got pork adobo, bangus sisig and deep fried pork belly.  He was worried that I wouldn't like the dishes. However, the flavours of the dishes weren't far from Chinese food. The pork adobo was pork belly cooked in a concoction of soy sauce and vinegar. I really enjoyed this dish. The deep fried pork belly dish was my least favourite dish because I don't really like fried things. However, the sauce that it came with was delicious (tasted like a version of a plum sauce). Lastly, the bangus sisig was something that I've never had before. It's a fish dish but I swear it tasted like pork. I was so convinced that I was eating pork, my boyfriend had to Google image of bangus sisig dishes for me. This was my favourite dish and I would definitely order it again the next time I visit this restaurant. Be careful of the green peppers thought! They're super spicy!  I thoroughly enjoyed my meal here and I can't wait to come back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Our go to filipino restaurant in Toronto especially for pork sisig. I think this is one of the best in town! I tried the pork sinigang which is good and pakbet which is tasty also. I also liked their garlic rice too! The service is a little bit slow 15-20 mins which is ok. I think every Saturday night, there's a band playing and you have to pay $5 for the cover even if you don't wanna listen and you just want to eat lol. The band's performance is good it's just that the sound system is too loud and will really hurt your ears. So I prefer to visit Sunday night, a little bit quieter (except to one time that there's this one guy who sang 5 songs in karaoke) lol. Will definitely keep on coming back here and will recommend to visit this restaurant to my family and friends"}
{"text":"We came in on a Saturday evening for a night of drinks, snacks, and live music. I've never been here before but from the outside this place looks tiny. Inside is much larger than it leads on, but they aren't really equipped to accommodate groups larger than 8.  We ordered some beers, a few cocktails, and some food to share. The blue cocktail I had a sip from tasted like fresca.  For food we ordered the lechon kawali (crispy pork belly), sizzling sisig, milk fish sisig, this stuffed squid, and fried calamari. The pork was almost all fat and could have used some salt. I don't know what sauce they put on the side, but it would have tasted better with vinegar or hoisin sauce. The calamari was average, and the stuffed squid was a little bland. Think grilled unseasoned squid with some chopped tomatoes inside.  But the sizzling sisig. It was AMAZING! It was so good, it was salty, meaty, crunchy and just delicious. Inside there's an egg to mix in, and some green chile peppers. The flavour was not only spot on, but I'd say a perfect food to pair with beer. The milk fish sisig was also very good, but the sizzling is just too hard to beat.  Service is kind of slow, and the waitresses were a bit mindless. But there were only 2 of them working the entire floor, and it was late night so I can't really blame them. Others have already mentioned the $5 band cover, but i should add that they don't charge at the door. They tack it onto your bill at the end.  While I thought the live band was a nice touch, it was a bit amateur. It was more like karaoke than a live professional band. They take requests and anyone can go up to sing.  Overall this place is average. The atmosphere was kind of a like a place you go to drink when you're sad or heartbroken. They play a lot of old and nostalgic Filipino songs. I don't think I would come back on a Saturday night, but I would come for a few drinks and that sizzling sisig with friends any other day."}
