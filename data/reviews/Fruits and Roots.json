{"text":"Great juice! Great service! Great prices (compared to most of the juice spots in town)! Try the All Green Everything and Zucchini Muffin!"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential! The food was very fresh. I ordered the Earth Bowl....the fruit was fresh and the smoothie base was a great consistency....my only complain would be that there wasn't enough smoothie and way too much granola.   My main problem was the service here. I waited 10-15 mins for my food. My order was wrong....and I drove off with no spoons to eat my acai bowl. I asked for no onions in my wrap but they put them in there anyways. Asked for no banana on top of acai bowl but still got them as well. This should have been a quick place to get food considering they have a drive thru...but all of this took 30 mins trying to get my order correct. This place is also pricey...which I understand because it's an organic wellness spot but being charged $50 for my order feels like a rip off when the service sucks."}
{"text":"Love their juices, soups, and wraps! I'll be a frequent visitor for juices & smoothies!"}
{"text":"I just bought the all green cleanse today for $50 I was thinking about starting the cleanse tomorrow but I have noticed they gave me old juices. One was dated back to 17th 3 were dated 19th only 2 juices were made fresh today dated 20th. I thought they make their jucies fresh every day yeah right there goes the freshness. Considering you should only keep the juices 24 hrs in the fridge before you lose the nutrition. According to my math all the nutritions are already lost in all of the 6 juices I have bought today. Since it has been 72 hrs for the oldest juice I have received from there today, it has lost all the nutritions.  Since I am gonna start my cleanse tomorrow its gonna be 72-96 hrs for the supposedly freshly juiced juice cleanse.  Not happy that I have just spend $50 on some old juice. Wont be buying from here again."}
{"text":"Me and my family came. After a very long wait, they finally gave our 2 orders of wraps, but our kids' food were not served. Not to mention my wrap had cheese when we requested no cheese. They did offer to make us another one but we didn't want to wait yet again. When we got done eating our wraps, our kids' salad bowls still were not ready. While waiting, we can see the staff from behind the counter making and serving food for other guests who came after us. Thirty minutes later, our 2 small salad bowls finally came. Not worth the time! Food is satisfactory. Service must be improved."}
{"text":"Love this place, my lunch date was late so I started with the Vegan cheesecake. Freaking amazing!!! Also the pregnant chick next to me loved it and loved the Super Fruit smoothie. If eating healthy is this good then count me in!!!"}
{"text":"Earlier is better.  Especially when you need a fix after the weekend.  All of their juices is really on point for what you need to get you through your day."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went through the drive thru here this afternoon for the first time.  I had the all green everything and she had the 24 carrot.  Both juices were perfect!  We will be back here A LOT."}
{"text":"The Fruit Protein Bowl is so delicious! I'll come back again for that. Had the immunity shot and WOAH thing packs a punch, but that made me feel like it was doing some good.  Also had the Farm Greens, which of your looking for that taste like pure greens then that's your drink ( Apple, parsley, lemon, green chard, celery, turmeric, cucumber, & cilantro)  If your in the mood for something really healthy this is your place and mine new go to spot!"}
{"text":"Great Store! Friendly staff and awsome healthy recipes... Fast and affordable...hands down to the crew.  Will definitly come back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on my way home from work. Friendly outgoing staff. Shayla was very helpful and educated me on the benefits of some of the ingredients. Ended up getting a raw juice with lots of veggies and turmeric. Will definitely be back soon. ...Oh and the juice was obviously delicious"}
{"text":"Update: the owner had me come back and re-try the island bowl. I am so glad I came back and tried because it was PERFECTION in a bowl. The granola came in large chunks and had such wonderful flavor! The fruits were so fresh and sweet! The staff was very welcoming and wonderful, and apologetic about my first experience. One of the best bowls I've had! This place has certainly gained a new regular.   I had a craving for a Pitaya bowl. Since Nekter in downtown SUMMERLIN is a farther drive and this place had pretty amazing reviews, I decided to try it out. I ordered an island bowl specifically because I am not a fan of blueberries. One of the toppings on my bowl was blueberries. I read a lot reviews raving about the homemade granola here but it was hard for me to fully appreciate that because I mostly got crumbs in my bowl, as if the my granola was taken from the very bottom of the container and no one had bother to refill it with fresh whole batch of granola. Again, I was disappointed. Thirdly, the Pitaya itself was quite bland as if it was watered down too much, and I didn't taste much of the mangoes as promised in the description. Sad to say, I will not be returning to try anything else since I was quite disappointed with my first experience. These types of bowls are not cheap so I would rather take the drive up to downtown SUMMERLIN Nekter where the food is consistently good and I don't have to worry about feeling like I wasted money on something I did not enjoy."}
{"text":"Came in and ordered an Earth Bowl. Tristan was awesome! He answered all my questions and was super accommodating in making the a√ßai to my preferred consistency. Super friendly, clean, and fresh-feeling environment!!! *two thumbs up*"}
{"text":"Excellent concept. So nice to have healthy lunch options nearby. But the prices are staggering. I spent $15 on a salad. It was a really good salad. Hummus bowl plus chicken. Because of the price I told myself I wouldn't go back. But I did and the salad was just as good the next time and the next.   The gummy bear smoothie is also awesome. Although I believe it was $14 so again I told myself I wouldn't be back. But I was. And the smoothie was just as good the second time.   The service can be a little slow compared to other drive throughs but since everything is made fresh I understand. The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is the prices."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about trying this out, but i am so glad I did. I came in not knowing what I should try, and the girl taking my order was SO helpful. She talked me through the options and helped me decide what to get. Everyone was so friendly and my drink (Gummy Bear with Vegan Protein Powder) was AMAZING!!!   Thank you so much for such an amazing experience."}
{"text":"The vegan caesar wrap is as good as it gets for vegan food at a fast food type place. It's also large and filling; there's a good chance you won't be able to finish it, unless you're particularly hungry. I haven't had a lot of different smoothies here, but the one I did have (microgreens) was great. Some places that bill themselves as health oriented fall short, but this one seems legit."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite juice shop Everyone, especially the owner Patricia, is so sweet and helpful. All the juices are great but the Acai bowls are even better! The protein acai bowl with vegan protein powder is amazing and has a great thick consistency. Also, the chicken gyro wrap is really delicious and not heavy at all. It's enough to save half for later which is always nice. I'd definitely recommend driving out of your way for this place!"}
{"text":"Both smoothies we got here were delicious, as well as the two juices we ordered. The Caesar salad I ordered was absolutely delicious and I would totally buy the dressing if they sold it bottled. My only wish is that the serving sizes were bigger for the cost. Other then that everything was great!"}
{"text":"Very excited to have found this spot. I live in Los Angeles where juice has been a thing for a while and this place is definitely up to par with spots out there. I frequent Vegas since I have family here and finding legit fresh juice places wasn't so easy up until finding this gem.   Although I didn't give it a try, the food menu looks great, too. Would definitely be down to try some of the bowls offered."}
{"text":"I was drooling over my co-workers salad the other day, and had to ask where she got it. She told me about Fruits & Roots, and I knew it would be a priority to check it out. I tried the Chicken Quinoa bowl (aka the drool worthy salad), and I wasn't disappointed. They heaped on the chicken and quinoa which made for a very filling and satisfying meal. I also opted to try one of their juices, being a ginger fan, I had to get the \"Ginge & Juice\".... Laid back... With my mind on my quinoa and my quinoa on my mind...... I'm a sucker for a good juice pun. Long story short, I will be back, as they are located conveniently on my way to work, and they have a drive through, which makes it way too easy to eat right."}
{"text":"Been here 2 times and both times wound up with a gyro chicken salad and a sweet asian.  This last time the gyro salad had a chicken bone in one if the pieces of chicken that I nearly choked on.  I have 2 small children that I sometimes share my food with.  This could have turned out much worse.  It's very convenient to have healthy drive thru options, but now I'm going to have to gingerly eat all the chicken and check and recheck anything I give my kids."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this juice bar!!!! Shayla is amazing and gave me free samples of everything she is super sweet and the juice is amazing and delicious and not too sweet! Love that they have no added agave... the global acai bowl is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for excellent cold pressed juice, don't look anywhere else. I think that their juices are better in taste than their competition. I took the \"Ginge & juice\" which I recommend you guyz ! They also have food that I will definitely try next time I stop by ! The only thing that can be improve is to have another location closer to the strip."}
{"text":"I go here about two times a week and get the Pure Bowl almost every time.  I obviously love it but occasionally there are frozen chunks of berries that did not bet blended.  I understand the organic, fresh, etc angle, but it is very pricey.  Almost $12 for an Acai Bowl.  Again, it is really good, but you have to pay for it.  I would be a more frequent visitor if it were a bit more affordable.    All that aside, it is the place to get a great Acai Bowl in all of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm so happy this place opened! The Mint Chip smoothie is amazing! I love their hummus bowl as well. A healthy drive through in Las Vegas is genius!"}
{"text":"I finally ventured off to try Fruits & Roots and I'm glad I did- I've been there 3 times just this week. The quality of the ingredients is definitely high, organic and healthy (which is what they market). They offer acai bowls, fresh pressed juices, superfood smoothies, and bowls and wraps for food.   So far I have only tried the Chicken Gyro Wrap, but it is so good I haven't wanted to try anything else! Grilled chicken, chickpeas, feta, red onion, romaine lettuce and a Greek yogurt dressing. The acai bowls are incredibly refreshing and I love the smoothies. I get the detox smoothie- it has a 'different' flavor, I think due to the ginger and green tea mixed with the fruit to be honest, but I like weird flavors so I still enjoy it. The gummy bear is one of their most popular, with banana kale coconut and pineapple and it all ties together really well for a healthy yet flavorful boost.  The only downfall about this place in my opinion is the price. I completely understand you get what you pay for, but for 2 smoothies and 2 wraps it was about $50. I'm all about fresh ingredients but that's a little absurd!  They do have a drive thru which is convenient and the restaurant inside is very clean."}
{"text":"I get the FLUSH JUICE AND IT IS AMAZING  The cease salad is really good too   They just opened and the last behind the counter making the salad is extremely slow . But this is now my regular juice bar !!"}
{"text":"Chicken Gyro wrap is out of this world, mango bar and acai bowl where amazing.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Fruits and Roots was just okay. I probably won't be returning unless I already happen to be in the area for some reason.  I ordered the Sweet Greens juice and the Earth a√ßa√≠ bowl (comes with fruit toppings). Both were pretty much as expected for a typical juice bar, but with higher prices than most places I've been. The a√ßa√≠ bowl was about average size (10 oz or so) but was $10.50, and it seemed like all of their bowls were around $9-11. Their juices were around $8.50.  When I visited, Fruits and Roots was in a relatively empty complex with only two other customers inside. Despite this, it still took more than 15 minutes to prepare the a√ßa√≠ bowl. The juices are already in glass bottles and don't require any prep time. One of the main reasons that I go to juice bars is frequently for convenience. If it takes this long to wait for an a√ßa√≠ bowl, I could make one of these at home. It seemed to have fairly standard fruit and granola toppings as well.   Overall the quality didn't justify the price here for my opinion. Also if I'm stopping by somewhere to grab something to go, I don't particularly anticipate or want to wait for 20 minutes (especially given that the store was essentially empty. I can't imagine how long this might take if there was more of a crowd.)   I'll probably continue going to Pressed Juicery instead - higher quality, more unique ingredient combinations, and faster service at a similar price point."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place since they were first building. I finally went there today with my father. There was no one in there, and we got there before lunch time. I had the island bowl and my father had the detox smoothie. My dad loved his drink and I enjoyed my island bowl. I can't wait to try their other items on their menu. I used to drive all the way to summerlin for a pitaya bowl. This is now my go to spot for a delicious and refreshing meal/drink, way closer to home."}
{"text":"I have been here now 5 times and love all of the different juices and bowls I have tried.  Everything is really fresh and actually tastes great!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Uber fresh, not too sweet, uber yummy.  I am not an acai bowl girl. Something about acai doesn't rub me the right way. Pitaya bowls, however... now we're talking. Their Island Bowl is amazing and really delicious. I have had lots of pitaya bowls and this just tastes great and clean. My hubby tried a cold-pressed juice mix and said it tasted exactly as described. If you come here, know that what is described on their menu is exactly what you're getting. Staff was nice and friendly. Lots of seating. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Great spot.!!! Recommendations: Beet it & Ginge & Juice - pressed juices*  wellness shots - immunity. Salad- Chicken Gyro  Great service.! I absolutely love that the owner Patricia was there helping out and giving us great knowledge of the ingredients in everything. Definitely be coming back.!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go here since before it opened. I got the pure bowl and the refresh juice, both were super good and I would definitely come here again. The staff is very friendly and quick to take your order. They make everything fresh and they have wraps and bowls that your can order. The place is very clean and has a really cozy feeling. I'm not sure if they have free wifi but if they do it's defiantly somewhere to hangout and do homework or work."}
{"text":"I was helped out by a lovely girl named Madison! She was the friendliest person, she helped with everything (since I was a newbie to the juicing sensation). I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for friendly service and great juice!! I don't go anywhere else!!"}
{"text":"My hubby had a wrap and said it was pretty good. The salad I had was made with fresh ingredients. They could've been mixed before being served, since the bowl isn't big enough for someone to do so without making a mess. I also had a ginger green tea, and it was good. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"I very highly recommend the wellness bowls, which are basically smoothie parfaits.  Also weirdly good: the vegan cheezcake. The texture is not at all like cheesecake, but it is quite good in its own right."}
{"text":"The two employees I talked to has no idea what was in their drinks they were selling. I asked for nutritional information and was informed it hadn't been made yet. It was disappointing to not be able to order anything. When you promote healthy foods and drinks at your business....having nutritional info is a must!  Couple positives were the place look really nice and I loved that they have a Vegas strong wall. Maybe I'll try again after a few months and they have it more together. :/"}
{"text":"Being hungover on the strip i wanted something healthy, and came across this place on postmates. I eat super healthy and paleo and guys this is like god parted the heavens and sent Me this. I probably would have low key died without the paleo banana bread; which my only regret is that i only got one. The juices are bomb. And the daily kick start shot got me ready to rally. I even mixed one of the juices with my tequila cuz #balance. Am i right? I got the chicken gyro bowl but saving it for later but it looks delish. This is my new go to while being in Vegas."}
{"text":"The island and glow bowl are my two favorites! You can never go wrong with these two. So refreshing especially after a hard workout."}
{"text":"Ok I officially love this place. Went back to try the WellBowl...a build your own grilled chicken salad...10 stars! SO fresh and delish, and their homemade dressings are fabulous. The staff there is super helpful and friendly and the place is spotless. They are located a bit off the beaten path but well worth the trip. Hope they expand all over the city."}
{"text":"A healthy alternative for your snacking or eating needs.   Visited fruits and roots on a Saturday afternoon. There was some kind of troll connect 4 tournament taking over the whole place inside and outside as they had flowers all over the table. My friends and I were stuck eating outside and pushing flowers to the side. This was quite frustrating as it was windy outside and loud inside with no place to sit. Wish the business would have accommodated this better  Anyway- tried the acai protein bowl. Very good, good quality ingredients and a nice blend of flavors. Portions are small compared to many other acai bowl shops about $11-$12.  Prices in general are much more than other places.  There menu is pretty large and some items look really good (cold pressed juice, gluten free bakery items, burritos)   Might return to try some other menu items. Acai I will stick to places such as creamberry, bowlology, vitality bowl...."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the slowest place I have ever been to. The workers don't even acknowledge you when you're there. Terrible customer service. Has happened every time I've been here. Scratch that from your lunch break because it will definitely take 1 hour just to make ur food..."}
{"text":"While being a vegetarian and now vegan in Las Vegas it can be quite difficult sometimes to locate a decent place/restaurant that will have good options for you.  Well I did some research and located Fruits & Roots to try out. Recently I flew into Vegas with minimal sleep into the early morning and drove to get some fresh juice along with a bowl of greatness.. The juices were so refreshing and delicious, I had the Ginge & Juice and also the Apple Spice,, both of the them were good but I will say that Ginge & Juice is my favorite.. I also bought the Pure Bowl which was very delicious and yummy with lots of organic freshness.  The price is a little high but for the quality of cold pressed organic juice in a glass take home bottle (reusable) and all of the fresh organic ingredients in the Pure Bowl, its well worth it for me and for my body.  Fruits & Roots is now my goto spot whenever Im in Vegas and need some great energy and fuel to maintain my health & nutrition in good balance.   Try them out and feel great.."}
{"text":"Disaster!! Came today at 11 am waited 15 min to order and then 15 min for a smoothie bowl!! Really???? And saw them putting blueberries right from store container to my bowl. Didnt wash them or anything!  The bowls are good. But service sucks!!! All people were waiting forever!"}
{"text":"Overall it's over pricy for nothing, also they have a nice trick to make you sign in\"sign in for free wellness shot\"-A COMPLETE LIE ! After you did the check in you discover it's only if you by the cleaning system kit or something like that. Also not all their fruits or veggies are organic !"}
{"text":"Everything I've had from there has been absolutely wonderful. The staff is friendly and it doesn't take forever to get your order. The things they offer are unique and can't be found anywhere else. And how amazing is it that there's a drive through for healthy food?!"}
{"text":"This spot it located off of Blue Diamond in an almost random complex area. It is located right next to a Greek restaurant, which I have yet to try!  I love the decor on the inside, it is so refreshing, just like their acai bowls.  They have a really cool Vegas Strong painting on one of their walls and I really liked that part.  I decided to try an acai bowl and it was so good. Although it is on the pricey side, it was nothing I didn't expect because fruit bowls are always way expensive! It tasted so good. There was granola on the bottom and acai puree mix, then more granola and cut up fresh fruit on top. The fruit was a mix of bananas, strawberries, blueberries and coconut flakes on top. They put some sort of sweetener on the top, like agave syrup or something.  I would definitely go back to this place because I love the vibe on the inside and love the taste of their bowls! I felt really energized and good about what I ate afterward... and I actually enjoyed my healthy meal!!!"}
{"text":"I'm all for healthy choices and organic produce, and I realize both of those things come at a premium price- but $7.50 for a 14 ounce iced latte was a shocker! Food prices are more reasonable, with $8-11 acai and \"wellness\" bowls, but unfortunately purchases across multiple visits failed to impress: coffee was watered down and weak, acai bowl was small and less flavorful than other options around town (despite the organic produce), chicken quinoa bowl was basic and boring.  I like their colorful and detailed chalkboard art, modern decor and veggie planters on the patio, but the food needs tweaking because this spot should be highlighting how flavorful healthy eating can be! Judging by other reviews, the cold pressed juices seem to be their forte. Staff seemed too busy to provide individualized service or small talk, which is odd considering they outnumbered me as the only customer."}
{"text":"Fruits and Roots is a refreshing change of pace to the Las Vegas market place.  Fabulous menu, genuine and friendly staff and very reasonable prices.  Forgo that Starbucks and do something healthy for yourself!  I had the Earth Bowl today and it was heavenly.  Super fresh, delicious and a great value.  I have found my new spot and it is Fruits and Roots!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars.  The girls that work here did the best they could, they were moving like lightning. However the wait time was insane under the circumstances. The drive thru seemed to be the focus, but there is a total of 2 staff members to take the orders and make the food for the front counter and drive thru. They were spread thin. Took 20 or 30 minutes just to get smoothies and food. Everything else was great, including the employees. They handled it really well, very pleasant.  Not going to post less stars just because of 1 bad experience and the length of time it took to get food and smoothies. Ill be back and hope to update this review with the 5 stars it deserves. Hopefully they will have a 3rd or 4th person to support the business"}
{"text":"So far so good for a organic place.  My favorite is the Strawberry Mint lemonade.. Yum, didn't get the chance to try all the fresh juice.  I am not a big fan of veggie drinks..   The wrap is not bad, it has a very clean taste..chicken can be a little more tender, maybe more variety on the selection to build your own wrap.   People working there are super young, they are nice and friendly, but NOT trained.  Kind of slow and no knowledge of the menu that well.  Organic eaters are very picky, so my suggestion will be train them 100% knowing the food and menu."}
{"text":"Drive thru is so convenient for something healthy. Love their a√ßa√≠ bowl and their salads"}
{"text":"I was hoping to write a better review for this place, but unfortunately my first experience was not very stellar.  It took over ten minutes to place my order, and I was the only person in line.  The girl behind the counter was busy preparing other patron's meals.  She was very pleasant as was the entire staff, as they were trying to complete orders.  I didn't mind terribly, but felt bad for others waiting.  I ordered the Chicken Quinoa salad.  Considering it is all organic, you can expect to pay a premium, but the portion for 11 dollars was reasonable.  Unfortunately, there was no Quinoa on the salad, and I didn't realize it until I got back to my office; bummer.  I was hoping to have the Vitality Beat juice, but it was sold - for the season.  I suggest taking it off the menu.  Instead I ordered the Beat It - It is good, not exactly the flavor I was interested in and that is because of the Cilantro and Celery,  It tastes like it should be hot.  Cool jar though.  All in all if your looking for a good juice bar this place has potential...It's new and I am sure will get better as they work out the kinks.  I followed it up with a banana laffy taffy - so much for eating healthy today.  (new)I changed my rating from three stars to four because I believe that good customer service makes up for a lot.  The owner reached out to me on Yelp; come to find she was also the one who helped me. As I mentioned previously, very pleasant.  She offered a complimentary bowl, and as tempting as that sounds, I would be happy to pay for it and give them another try simply because they care about their customers.  Cheers."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today. I waited at the drive thru and no one took my order. I went ahead and drove up to order at the window. The girl at the window did not seem too surprised. I ordered a small super fruit smoothie, which basically averages out to be a little over $1/oz...for almost a $9 smoothie.  If the smoothie was actually good, the experience would've left a better taste in my mouth(literally). I had to chew my entire smoothie...it was the consistency of oatmeal. Incredibly disappointed and out $9 after my first visit. Not sure if I'll go back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place!  My girlfriend raves about it all the time and how it's her fav acai bowl spot in town.  I went twice and unfortunately, I have been disappointed both times.  The first time I ordered an acai bowl and decided to eat it on my drive home.  When I finally looked down to see an almost finished bowl I noticed a blueberry that was completely moldy and was covered in green fuzz.  I decided to give it another try a few weeks later, thinking that it was a one time fluke.  As I was eating my second bowl I noticed something inedible.  I spit it out and found something, not exactly sure what it was, but it feels rubbery like a rubber band, but again not quite sure.  I really really wanted to love this place, but instead I had to throw away my bowl."}
{"text":"One of my fave spots in town. They have yummy a√ßai bowls and delicious juices and I've still never been inside! All hail the healthy drive thru! I only wish they had a rewards program ...of which, I'd likely be a Platinum member (what's above that?! Dolomite? Turbonium? Kryptonite?) People, it's a drive-thru salad and juice bar!   The stuff dreams are made of! The staff members are always nice and efficient (and pretty attractive now that I think about it!). They accept cards so you don't even need to carry cash (OK, I keep singles in my car for tips!) The selections are organic and super tasty. Love it!  It's in a business park which is kind of random, but worth the slight detour. They're easily accessible off the Buffalo exit on 215 on Sunset Rd. I just go thru the drive thru & pop back onto the fwy. Easy peasy! I promise to try different stuff and update my review as I go, but so far, you cannot go wrong with a Pure Bowl or 24 Carrot juice(4 yr old approved!). Here's to a happy, healthy you - Cheers!"}
{"text":"Acai bowl was meh2. But the 24 carot Juice I'm obsessed with. The quinoa chicken salad was delicious. Pricey but aren't all Juice places smh"}
{"text":"THIS place, yummmmm. Cant say enough great things, food is so delicious & healthy... atmosphere & decor is artistic! And they have several Tower Gardens on the patio growing fresh produce!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I called in the day of and asked them questions about the cleanse. Very informative and nice! I told her I would be stopping by 10 min before they closed (because of my commute after work) and she was very nice and said she would be waiting for me. When I arrived she knew I was the one in the phone and had my juices ready and took the time to label them and plan my cleanse days accordingly.   I was very satisfied with my juices, all of them tasted amazing and I love the glass bottle feeling! I plan on coming back to eat once I'm off the cleanse!"}
{"text":"So far everything I have tried has been delicious! The best Acai bowls around!! The strawberry mint lemonade is delicious. The staff there is so friendly. Maddie S was so helpful. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I pass by this place often and I've always been intrigued to try it. Finally stopped by today. Upon walking in, I noticed it was very clean and welcoming. The employees were very nice and accommodating.   I ordered the pure bowl, all green everything cold pressed juice and a detox smoothie. The all green everything was great. The detox smoothie and the pure bowl lacked flavor and tasted like ice - there was also a huge frozen piece of something (unknown what) inside of my bowl. I paid almost $35 bucks for everything....I read other reviews about people complaining about prices. Idk, I'm willing to pay for things that I enjoy to eat. The bowl and smoothie just weren't very enjoyable to me.   I probably won't return (based on the lack of flavor), but I wish this business nothing but the best."}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch i love these little healthy juice and food business! we need more of them. i had the quinoa chicken bowl and it was outstanding also thought i would try out there Juice and see how they compare to other juice places.. while there juice is a little smaller than other it thought it was well priced. well definitely be back again  The girls that were working the counter we quick to take my order and were very helpful"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places that has cold pressed juices. My fav is the ginge and juice. Love that they are organic, fresh and have vegan options. Go support a local business. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love everything. Build your own wrap, Acai Bowls and soup yumm! Staff is super friendly I love Maddie and Kendra!"}
{"text":"So yummy! The only thing no the price is a little high maybe the owner should consider a stamp card or reward system. Also the wait was a little bit longer than expected but it wasn't too long so that's OK"}
{"text":"Had the dr blue green and it is delicious, so good will def be back!   Thank you to the awesome worker who suggested this!"}
{"text":"So far I have tried the hummus wrap, chicken quinoa wrap & the gyro chicken wrap and all of them were great. Their banana bread was also pretty good and very light. Very happy with the menu, the ingredients and that they have a drive thru. It is pretty expensive, but it's to be expected when all the ingredients are organic. You should be proud to have one of the healthiest restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"After popping in to the Greek spot next door (that place is great, by the way), my wife and I went in to see what kind of smoothies Fruits and Roots had. Nothing really appealed to me which was fine, because I realized that a cold pressed juice is NINE DOLLARS. AYFKM? Girl, bye. The places you are modeling yourself after don't even charge that much. I live in the Mecca of health and wellness (Portland, OR) and this pricing wouldn't fly there.   We ended up settling on sharing a 20oz \"strawberry mint lemonade\". Do you know what their lemonade is? It's water with some lemon squeezed in, pulverized strawberries (tops on), and mint. You know the free cucumber or lemon water you get when you check into a hotel or stop into the bank? That's literally what this is. And it is NOT good, especially for $6. They asked us if we wanted it sweetened with agave. Agave is just as refined as sugar, if not more so.  ¬Ø\_(?)_/¬Ø   A note about staff: the kid at the register was nice and pleasant and greeted us, but then proceeded to explain the menu. That's weird, because I know how to read and have been to a juice wellness place before. What these folks are selling isn't much different than any other place. Second, I guess the owner was there but he didn't greet us because probably we don't look CrossFit or paleo enough or whatever. He made sure to get up and greet the people who came after us who looked like they just came from yoga. I'm a competitive power lifter, play roller derby and do yoga 6x a week. I'm your demographic. I would recommend not judging a book by its cover."}
{"text":"Fruits and roots is a beautiful little place. It has a wide selection of juices smoothies and wraps and salads. Almost everything is gluten-free. The people that work there are very friendly and accommodating everything there can be Modified. Food is really good. I tried the Popeye juice and the euro salad with chicken is delicious."}
{"text":"I love this place! I always thought of having a fast food healthy place so I'm glad one finally exists! They are near by to me so it's perfect to drive thru. They also have locations inside the Look salon at Town Square and soon at Tivoli. I like how everything is organic. Their wraps are good as well and you can try a different juice and smoothie each time you go. The acai bowls are really filling. You have to make sure you try their walnut bread, it's amaze-balls!"}
{"text":"EDIT: the banana walnut paleo bread is PHENOMENAL. It tastes like a a delicious banana nut pound cake!   I have only had juice here but I am impressed! I'm pretty picky about my juice because I don't like the taste of too much green. Although I know I need to incorporate veggies into my diet, they are not my favorite. By drinking juice, I'm still able to get a lot of those nutrients. So for that, I am thankful. I was on this side of town and decided to stop by. I went in to get the true inside experience instead of choosing the drive through. There were a couple people inside eating what looked to be delicious salads! I saw a salad bar and I know they also have acai bowls. When I arrived around 2pm, a majority of the juices were sold out, so I just got what was in stock. I'm really hoping to come back and try either a salad or a bowl and hopefully there will be more options in stock for me to try!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. A must stop every time I am in Vegas. Amazing food, smoothies and juices. Great atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"This review is based on my first visit yesterday, but I am open to giving them one more chance. I got the earth bowl and asked for the blend to be heavier in the spinach rather than more fruit. Taste wise, she made it just right since it had the perfect balance of sweet and savory. I do love that they add pumpkin seeds on top since it adds more texture. My only complaint is the fact that I noticed a few chunks of frozen fruit in my bowl that I didn't expect and were too hard to chew. They are a bit pricy for the amount they give you so it just disappointed me that I couldn't eat my whole bowl since there were a few hard chunks of fruit. They have a good looking menu so I am curious to try some of their other items next time around but overall it did taste good."}
{"text":"It's super healthy but a good healthy where the food actually has taste . I had the build your own salad and it was delicious . The pressed juice is okay the one that I had wasn't the greatest I just have to choose a different one the next time I go . Definitely delicious healthy food ."}
{"text":"Acai bowls are great! They aren't as sweet as other acai bowls around Las Vegas because they use a reduced sugar version, not the sorbet version. I absolutely love their granola - crunchy yet light! Cute decor and a very nice environment. Will be back when I want to splurge on health conscious food!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I took one of my friends who loves juices and knows way more about juices than I do. She calls herself a juice snob. She LOVED it as much as I do. Juice snob approved! Must try their acai bowls, too. And the ambiance? Clean, smells great. Easy to get to location. I can go on and on but you need to go see for yourself!  UPDATED 4/20/16 - I decided to try the cleanse here. I'm generally not as healthy as I should be and I was feeling fatigued lately so I decided to try the 3 day juice only cleanse. What I loved was that all 3 days don't have to taste the same. Day 1 I was in good spirits but around 7pm I began to doubt if I'd make it all 3 days. I slept early and woke up before my alarm clock on day 2. I've never felt better. I'm more alert, I'm not starving, and I can focus better. I smashed through my to do list- no problem! Definitely something I will incorporate into my life every few months.   The best part was how supportive the staff is. I pop in every morning to pick up my juices for the day and they give me tips and encouragement. They genuinely care."}
{"text":"First time visit--worth the trip. Staff was friendly and were good at recommending a bowl. Pure is most popular, which I ordered. My daughter got Island bowl. Both are fantastic choices. I also got an Americano, which dusted any Starbucks Americano I have had. Inside store is clean and modern. A cool place."}
{"text":"This place needs way more help than they currently have. There are only 2 girls working here, and they are both very sweet. However, the drinks and food took way too long to come out - we were ready to cancel our order. The Mint Chip Superfood Smoothie is AMAZING and I would come back (only through the drive-thru) just for this drink. My Chicken Gyro was nothing special, though, and I would most likely not order that again. I'm really not sure that I would come back here considering the fact that they have 2 staff members. I hope management considers hiring more people here and the business would be thriving!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious...the salad I had was so refreshing and the staff was awesome"}
{"text":"Went in for the first time today. The young lady behind the counter was SUPER helpful and SUPER sweet. The Protein bowl after a long work out is a perfect breakfast. Prices are a little high but let's be honest you get what you pay for. I'd rather spend a few extra dollars knowing I am getting quality ingredients. And let me tell you this bowl is quality!!! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I wanted so badly for this company to succeed but sadly many in my office and myself have given it so many chances and have been disappointed every time. Wrong orders, long waits for simple items, being overcharged, etc. The food is great but very expensive and with bad service too there's no way I can continue to fork over that amount of money regardless of the food. I ordered a cashew cafe in the drive thru and was made to wait probably 6-8 mins, not exaggerating which is long for a drink that is pre bottled every morning. I was finally given the drink and drove away when I looked at the emailed receipt and I was charged $14!!! I then looked at the drink and I was given the cashew cream which is a less expensive drink as well! The line was extremely long in the drive thru and I had to get back to work so I had to park and go in. The place was empty. Why such a long wait??? I showed the cashier the mistake and they said they had run out of the cashew cafe that day and I could drink some of my drink and they could add the espresso shot after. How unprofessional.  This is after many times ordering there with bad service I will give a place a chance because everyone has off days but it has gotten so ridiculous at this point I would be an idiot to eat there again. Maybe new management is needed. The concept is great but execution is one of the worst I've seen in a restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered the protein bowl and my boyfriend ordered the island bowl. Bowls tasted great but I thought the prices were a little much for the size. Also, if I pay that price, I don't expect to have any frozen chunks in my bowl. I found 2. Other than that, the bowls tasted great and I can tell the quality was good!"}
{"text":"Had to come back the next day all thanks to Ms. Patricia K! She convinced me to give Fruits n Roots another shot and I'm extremely glad that I did.  This time around I ordered the Gummy Bear smoothie (wow) and the chicken gyro bowl. The smoothie was perfect. Sweet, refreshing, and creamy (probably the cashew milk) yum. The chicken gyro bowl was full of flavor and the serving was actually bigger than I expected.   I'm glad I was able to try more things and give a better, more deserving review. Thank you, Patricia, at Fruits n Roots!"}
{"text":"I love that this place has a drive-thru. It has supported my lifestyle. The indoors is gorgeous and has a comprehensive menu. I've had a number of their juices, and I'm a fan of the mint chocolate smoothie (has fresh mint and cacao nibs!). Sidebar: the owner is amazing."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! It's basically right off the freeway and love that they also have a drive thru! They have such a great selection from juices and smoothies to wraps and salads. I got an acai bowl and my boyfriend got the gyro chicken salad - both were AMAZING. Everything tasted so fresh. Even though it's far from where I live, I would absolutely return to try out more items!!"}
{"text":"This seems to be a nice restaurant but I prefer other organic cafes. I prefer to see my smoothie being made.  My smoothie here tasted like moldy berries! I want to see gloves used!  Clean utensils etc.   The blenders should have sound barriers.  I can get past the poor service and high prices, guy and girl with attitude but at least give me a quality drink.  Because I can't see if produce is fresh and washed I won't return."}
{"text":"I come here at least 3-4 days a week! The food is really really good, fresh and healthy! But the service is SO SLOW! Especially in the drive through. My mother and I ordered 2 smoothies and it took 23 min to get them. There was no one else in line so being to busy wasn't the case. I still love this place but I wouldn't come here if you're looking for a quick healthy snack."}
{"text":"Fruits and roots is the best in town. Love the all green everything juice and the euro salad bowl all the island bowl. Service is super awesome there, Vianca and Mady were very helpful"}
{"text":"My boss turned me onto Fruits and Roots and I never thought healthy could taste this good. I don't know what the other reviews re the staff are about because I'm always greeted with a smile. I'm in and out and never feel guilty about my choices."}
{"text":"Drive thru healthy spot! Yes!   Bookmarked this place awhile ago because I was looking for a place that had acai bowls around me.   The service is a bit hard to judge since it was thru the drive thru but they were fairly quick and friendly considering it was only a 30 second if that interaction.   4 stars tho for the acai bowl. It was good! Filled with fresh strawberries, bananas, blueberries, sunflower seeds and granola (I believe that was all that was in there). Some of the acai in my bowl was still I'm frozen chunks but I was able to mash it up on my own. Its a bit smaller than other places and a bit more costly. Just for convenience because its by my office, I'll probably go back."}
{"text":"I was thirsty and saw this was a new organic cold pressed juice spot so I decided to drop in to give it a try. I got the cashew but with spirulina, a green and a beet juice it was delicious !!"}
{"text":"So was thinking of acai bowl for recovery meal. Fruits and Roots was on my radar so figure now would be good time. lol. Fruit and Roots had no idea nice diversity of food that on the menu. It was my first time. I always thought more healthy juice spot. They have nice not huge but great selection of salad and and sandwiches. All of them catered towards healthy side. I was only craving acai bowl but plan on going back for regular food.  The acai bowls they have few choose from so asked for recommendation. I got the Island Bowl. Which is one of the more popular choices and after killing the whole bowl understand why. Really good. All the fruit on top was super fresh, no bruises, and looked so refreshing. It was fruit artwork the way they had everything laid out on top. The portion size is great! I definitely would order this acai bowl again and again.  The inside of the restaurant is pretty cool. It definitely got personality with one wall with long chalkboard with all kinds of info about eating healthy lifestyle. All fresh pressed juices comes in nice glass bottles. They have little outside patio area dine in. They even have drive through window!   The service was five stars for me. It was my first time got great recommendation, friendly service, and positive vibes all around."}
{"text":"The girls working were very nice and the banana bread was very good however the a√ßa√≠ bowls were just okay. I didn't like how the fruits come frozen and they aren't customizable because the bowls are pre-made the day before. Lattes were okay. If I return, I'll be trying a salad; a√ßa√≠ bowl wasn't good enough to get again"}
{"text":"I am so happy I found Fruits and Roots; in my opinion they have the best acai bowl in town! Yes, service is a little slow but that's because the food is being prepared fresh, I think that's worth the wait. The interior is clean, inviting, and comfortable and the staff members are friendly!"}
{"text":"My first experience at Fruits & Roots was a good one! Very convenient location (Buffalo & 215). Plenty of seating and cool decor, also has outdoor seating. Staff was helpful and very accommodating. This place has a drive-thru which is a big plus. They dont do tastings like others in town but that's the only negative. They have all sorts of acai bowls for breakfast and lunch menu looks good, big selection of wellness bowls. I had a All Green Everything juice, daily kick start shot (apple cider vinegar, lemon, turmeric, ginger, cherry) & the strawberry Paleo Power Balls. The perfect breakfast to get me buzzing. Look forward to coming back to try lunch."}
{"text":"This is definitely my new favorite healthy eating spot! Their juices are delicious and fresh. Their food is not only beautiful but nutriciously satisfying. The employees are so friendly and knowledgeable. They made me feel welcome. As someone who is slowly making positive, healthy changes, this place makes me feel good."}
{"text":"I truly appreciate the commitment to Organic , fresh produce in everything they do at Fruits & Roots. The food is delicious. The cold pressed organic juices taste amazing. If \"Superfoods\" are a goal in your regime, this restaurant makes it fun & easy to accomplish. I will add that the staff is friendly,  helpful, and the restaurant is well designed and impeccably clean. One of my favorite stops in my weekly success routine."}
{"text":"I'm so glad this place opened in my neighborhood. It's not too far from TruFusion, so after class you can treat yourself to one of their amazing juices. Refresh is my favorite. The decor is appealing and the staff very nice. I hope they do well, and I plan to return."}
{"text":"Juice is delicious what I had was a little on the sweet side I make my own juices at home with a bullet and Jack LaLanne juicer mine is not as good ,  they do make a good product I had a wrap was not carzy about it..  I think for juice this is a good place"}
{"text":"Hands down best Acai bowls in Vegas! I sometimes try new bowls from different places and nothing ever even comes close to comparing. Nothing! The double granola is my favorite part  not only do you get It on top of the bowl but they also put it on the bottom so once it gets a little melty it mixes in perfectly and does NOT get soggy. My personal favorite is the Island bowl because of the taste and pretty natural pink color. I don't even know why I bother trying new places at this point because they never compare. Already craving another one and I just had one for breakfast!"}
{"text":"First time at Fruits and Roots and absolutely loved it! They let you sample the cold pressed juices and NATE was EXTREMELY helpful in explaining each one and it's benefits!  Purchased some of the \"Beet It\" for energy and the \"Cashew Cafe\" excited to be back! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Desperately needed oasis reminiscent of California. Local, organic food and drink served in an environment completely detached from Vegas' usual chaos. Not at all pricey considering the city's drenched in cheap alcohol. How much better can you get than local and organic anyway?   The entire menu is packed with nature's goodness. Whether you want a bowl, wrap, lemonade or smoothie, you're in for a fresh, natural treat.  Con: Bowl is on the small side, but that's because it tastes like magic so it makes you want more. It did that to me."}
{"text":"I was so excited to go when I saw the menu online. I called a couple of my friends and we went to the location on W. Sunset Rd. After we ordered we sat for an hour and 45 minutes until staff member said \"what are you guys doing here?\" in quite an interesting condescending way!?! They forgot about my order:/However if that was the only occurrence I would still go back because the food was excellent-but it wasn't. I ordered for the staff Thursday, Friday and yesterday and as our delivery guy arrived each day they forgot about one of our sandwiches. They did actually give us credit for the sandwiches but it's more hassle than it's worth to eat there. Maybe I'll try going back after they train their staff."}
{"text":"I was headed to a different vegan restaurant and saw this place. I decided to stop. To me the location isn't very good as it is kind of hidden. I would have not even known it was there unless I drove by. I was going down sunset from Durango which is off the beaten path a bit. That being said the place itself is clean and nicely decorated.. has a contemporary beachy feel to it. The staff were very friendly. I ordered the hummus wrap with the vinaigrette dressing, ginger tea and a energy shot of some sort. The shot was pretty good but a bit acidic. The ginger tea was good and mellow. The wrap at first was just okay.. it took a couple bites for me to get to the collage of food that made this wrap really good. I would tell people that there is a specific way to eat this wrap. Because all the flavors together are great. Eating one side or the other of it loses its luster. But when you have all the veggies and vinaigrette and hummus on one bite makes it pretty marvelous.. I'm finding out more and more that it's quite pricey to eat vegan at a restaurant. All of them are about the same in price.. I ordered the wrap, ginger tea and shot and it came out to $24. That seems to be the going rate actually. at first I was like holy heck they're expensive. Now it just seems to be the norm. Overall they were a good place. I would definitely come back and try one of their bowls and a different shot. Good luck fruits and roots!"}
{"text":"Don't go to the drive thru..... it bums me out with the experience I had today. I love coming here before I head to class, and I literally was here yesterday. I even Ordered the same thing!!!! The problem started when my drink came out iced, which is not what I ordered.  I was confused since it was a latte.... then it tasted completely different  then the day before and on top of everything else I had to pay 17$ for me morning coffee.... I also ordered  a yogurt parfait and when I asked for it she replied oh sorry we didn't charge you for that... not oh yeah let me get one...All that being said, I love the quality of food and the concept. However I think the drive thru needs to be reorganized or retrained.  I'm still bummed out about today!!!"}
{"text":"Great choices and ambiance however prices seemed to be higher than other juice place. We asked to taste some samples but was told they haven't had anything open yet. We ordered smoothies and it tasted great."}
{"text":"I stopped in and thoroughly enjoyed! Great atmosphere, phenomenal service, and food that is to die for! I am definitely going to be a regular!"}
{"text":"Just was at this place, was the only person there, they took 12 minutes to make two shakes, and made one of them wrong. I got two smalls priced at $8 each so Idk how my total was 19 something I don't think tax is that much. I guess I paid for the Choc nibs in my powerhouse that I didn't want and made my shake hard to drink. So disappointed in this. I'm sure I won't be back for expensive shakes that take so long to make and can't be made right, can't imagine if this place was busy I wouldn't have gotten my shakes till prob thanksgiving"}
{"text":"I went for my first time yesterday and got a 12oz powerhouse smoothie which was quite delicious and refreshing! I'm really drawn to the fact they have a drive through and they're quick, a lot of health food places take quite awhile and I'm awkwardly standing there waiting for my stuff. I will definitely return to try their acai bowl and their baked goods!"}
{"text":"So I ate here yesterday the Food was ok the acai bowl was good and I thought it was a little over priced but it was organic. Not even 30 mins later I got sick had the runs and I got body chills. I still have the diarrhea, I thought at first I was coming down with a cold but later that night I had no appetite, I felt like crap had a hard time sleeping, at 4 in the am I threw up and felt much better. From then on I knew I had gotten food poisoning. Called the establishment to let them know my situation,  my intentions at first were just to let them know to check there foods and then she starts telling me there is no way that I could've got food poisoning from them cause I wouldn't feel symptoms til 6hrs later. The owner was disrespectful and I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Okay, come on guys. The past few times I've had to wait for chicken to be cooked because they were \"out\". I understand that this food is cooked fresh, and I LOVE that, but when that is the only meat in the protein selection, they need to be a little more proactive. Today me and 3 others walked out because we didn't have time to wait 10-15 minutes."}
{"text":"Love this spot. Food is always fresh and so delicious. It feels good eating something equally as tasty as it is healthy!  Also LOVE the drive-thru. It has really come through for me in times of need!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Pure Bowl and it was delicious! The consistency of the base was perfect, the granola was so yummy and the fruit toppings were fresh and sweet! The workers here are also very friendly. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I've been coming here for the past 4 weeks off and on during lunch time.  The place is nice very country market style eating area with cool water glasses etc.  the prices are a bit higher than other organic healthy eateries in town but I don't mind paying if it's worth it.  Service is average as most of the employees don't smile and simply have to, \"ok you can order now look on their faces.\"  Again, I'm ok with the snob attitude because it's typical around here.  However, if your going to charge me $11 for a smoothie I shouldn't have to wait 15 min in the drive thru and even though the size is small, I would expect a little bit more.  I suspect this is how they keep their doors open because it is located in a small strip off the beaten path.  Good luck but I won't be returning for the basic reasons in my comments.  You can do better."}
{"text":"Initially, I loved this place and became bit addicted to it even though I have a Vitamix and a juicer and can make many of the juices and nutmilks at home.  I'm just admittedly lazy. : /  I've gone about 5 times now and can only speak on the nutmilks, shots, juices and the mint smoothie.  Service is very friendly; location is convenient to where I live.  The immunity shot is awesome!  I like their selection of shots.  The facility is clean and well-done; they have a drive through.  My only issue has been when I have ordered the mint smoothie, the first time, it blew me away.  It was so minty and perfect.  I came back a few days later to buy it again and it tasted totally different (barely any mint and mostly banana).  Because I had saved it to drink last - after the nutmilks I had purchased, I was far away from the store to mention it.  The next time I came in, I had mentioned my experience and the staff was ridiculously super nice and wanted to make my drink right.  I appreciated it!  It still did not come out like the first time so unfortunately, I just don't order the mint smoothie anymore.  Also, I have gone here the last few times and they don't have a large selection in the early morning - I asked when a good time was to come and the staff said later around 11 or 12 in the afternoon.  It kind of defeats the purpose of coming for juice prior to work and for my morning nutrition.  I'm usually not near the area by noon so it's a bit disappointing.  Still, it's great to have a place like this and I like that I can recycle the bottles and that it's organic.  The staff are all awesome as well..."}
{"text":"Great organic joint featuring fresh and healthy juices, smoothies, salads, fruit bowls, and coffee. Clean eating conveniently right off the highway even offers a drive-thru option!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE!! The cold press juices here are amazing and they have juice cleanses pre planned that you can choose from. Really fresh great products. Everyone who works here is always so friendly and if you're new to juicing they are more than happy to walk you through it! Great company I hope they are around forever and expand to more locations!!"}
{"text":"The simple fact that you charged me $31 for 2 quad shot almond lattes is more than enough reason why you get 1 Star."}
{"text":"This morning I went through the drive thru and placed an order for cold pressed juices and one super fruit smoothie. The smooth was four me and I drank the entire Large smoothie within 5-8 minutes of receiving it and driving away. At first I was thinking the taste is little sour and unpleasant but I continued to finish the smoothie. I figured maybe it just wasn't my favorite for my taste. By the time I got to work which a 45 minute drive, the super fruit smoothie created the worse feeling in my stomach. I felt like my stomach was cramped and I had a lot of acid reflux. Then an hour and half went by my body fully rejected the smoothie and I vomited it all out in my works public bathroom. NOT A PLEASANT AFTER EXPERIENCE AT ALL. This is not the first time this specific location has made my body upset from the product provided, this is the SECOND time! I called to speak with a manager at 3p and a girl named Natalie was unable to clearly inform me of the next manager available. So here is my review. Unpleasant, at home with food poisoning and never to want to return to either of your locations. I'm truly an unsatisfied and upset customer. I've received this outcome when I choose to pay money for convenience, healthy and simple food."}
{"text":"Great food and juices! The staff is great! Very happy to have a location closer to us! The other location on buffalo is amazing as well!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the costumer service. In one of our previous visits we found a pice of plastic in one of the acai bowls we told the manager in duty and she said that she was glad we didn't make a big deal today we eat there again and one of the smoothies was really bad we told the same manger and she said that if we wanted another one she would have to charge us for it I guess next time you do have to make a bid deal not coming back to this place."}
{"text":"I have visited Fruits and Roots 3 times and tried 3 different items. They are as follows:  Island Bowl (tried twice) Gummy Bear Smoothie (tried once) Mint Chip Smoothie (tried once)  During finals week (Dec. 2017) I needed a healthy pick me up and tried their Island Bowl for the first time. It was adequate but quite small for around $10. Additionally, I have tried an organic pitaya bowl from locally owned Juice N Go (on S. Rainbow and Oakey) that was much more flavorful, larger (various fruits topped the bowl), and less expensive. Thus, Fruits and Roots disappointed me when compared to Juice N Go.   On February 10, 2018 I tried Fruits and Roots for the second time. I had the Mint Chip smoothie which was deliciously creamy and tasted just like a mint chocolate shake. I was impressed. I should note I waited 16 minutes in the drive through, with only one other individual in front of me.  Since my smoothie was so good on February 10 I decided to try to give the Island Bowl another try along with the Gummy Bear smoothie on February 11, 2018. One word: BLAND. So terribly bland and my smoothie was lukewarm.  I really enjoy the concept of Fruits and Roots; the fact that they use organic products is very refreshing. However, as MANY yelp reviewers have noted the price is not justifiable for the amount of food one receives and the inconsistency of their dishes/drinks."}
{"text":"Great place! Hip cool vibe on the inside. Their fresh pressed juices are done daily. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is b/c I don't like cucumbers so there weren't any green juices w/o it."}
{"text":"Great smoothies!!! They taste amazing!! Well, at least the one I've had so far (mint chip). Their wraps were super good and healthy. The place was super clean and Matty was super attentive and nice!"}
{"text":"The service was friendly and professional. The food looked delicious. The only reason why I'm putting two stars is because I ordered their Pure Bowl (a√ßa√≠ bowl) and the menu failed to mention their homemade granola contains cashews and almonds. Hence, I had a extremely bad food reaction to it. Not super angry, but just a heads up for anyone with a nut allergy."}
{"text":"I still love this place! Seriously how convenient is having a drive- thru with such healthy and delicious food choices! The staff is always friendly as well, I wasn't sure which salad I was going for, and she kindly told me to pull to the window so I could sample the dressing! I ended up getting the Asian salad with chicken! (can't think of the actual name right now, but it was sooooo gooood)!!! Now I just wish they would add a location in Summerlin, or North Las Vegas, and maybe even a bigger food selection because everything's so tasty! Thanks for always being consistent with the freshness and quality of food that's served!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a healthy breakfast and lunch alternative that prides itself on serving all fresh organic fruits, veggies, cold pressed juices, smoothies and savory lunch bowls such as chicken gyro or hummus then you've come to the right place! Nearby our new office, I find myself frequently enjoying the food and juices here. I feel spiritually lifted after a meal here, truly soul food. Their staff are friendly and let you sample the juices and the raw earthy ambience is inviting."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM!! I love this place! Although it's about a 20-30 minute drive from me, it's totally worth it. The girls at the counter were super helpful. They let me sample some of their most popular juices and recommended some wonderful acai bowls. The atmosphere was so cool inside. And for those in a hurry, they have a Drive Thru! So Great! Everything I had was super scrumptious!! I can't wait to return:)"}
{"text":"I'm deducting a star because their juice isn't made fresh everyday.  I called to order a cleanse yesterday and requested juice made the same day but was told that wouldn't be possible because the juice was made the day before.  Not good if I'm trying to cleanse.  I found fresh juice elsewhere.  On a side note the Island Bowl and mint chocolate smoothie are bomb."}
{"text":"Pressed Juice and healthy food done right. Pretty pricy but everything I have tried has been great. There are so many of these types of places that miss the mark...especially on the food (I.e. Green and proteins)...this one is simple but 5 stars!"}
{"text":"A \"Best of Vegas\" winner in the Juice Bar category, I discovered this place with my brother during a impromptu detour through Las Vegas. The atmosphere is open & modern with seating inside & out. I really liked the tower gardens on the patio & was surprised to find out they also have a drive thru too. Fruits & Roots sustainability efforts include, cold pressed juices bottled in glass & all other packaging is completely biodegradable. Excellent option for health conscious travelers & dietary restrictions. I definitely loaded up on all the juice & plan to visit again & again. Grateful to find this gem!"}
{"text":"I love this place and I love their menu.  Everything is always great and the service is getting better and faster."}
{"text":"Love this place. Tucked into a business complex where you would least expect to find it. The lunch bowls are delicious and the juices are so fresh and so yum! My favorite part...most of the products used including the forks and to go containers and COMPOSTABLE!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE everything on the menu! The Strawberry Mint Tea is very refreshing. The Island Bowl with Honey on top is my favorite! I eat it for breakfast or as an afternoon treat with the super hot summer weather."}
{"text":"I pass by this place often and finally decided to give it a try. Definitely a plus that it has a drive thru and that you can call in your order. I decided to utilize the drive thru. The menu was very pleasing to the eye and catches your attention! So many different options as well! I originally wanted to order the island bowl but they said that they sold out of it, so I resorted to the glow bowl. Wait time for a drive thru was a bit much but I suppose that's to be expected for make when you order joints. I was handed my order and was a little disappointed as to how small the portion was for what I paid for. I've been to numerous places and ordered similar bowls and was given about double the order size for a similar price if not less. The glow bowl is quite delightful but again disappointed about the price to portion ratio. Not sure how often I will be able to visit considering the price is a bit high and I have other options with fair prices. At least I can I tried it!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place! Healthy delicious food, great service, and nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I decided to give this spot a try at the high recommendation of a friend. Super fresh produce peering at me from behind the glass, fresh bright colored juices displayed behind the counter and a gluten free menu had me at hello.   I ordered the chicken gyro wrap and a beet it juice, which also had greens in it. I took a fruit bar, it was vegan, to go as well. Im not vegan, and I approved! Everything was excellent and hit the spot.   What's the kicker?, I saw a drive-thru window. GENIUS. Great concept, great food and friendly staff. You are what you eat, I guess. Hope I can see more of these around Vegas sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"Stopped by here again for breakfast-to-go.   FYI, they do not serve food other than their bowls and juices until 11AM."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, quality ingredients, clean restaurant, exactly what I was hoping to find."}
{"text":"MUST TRY!!!!!!!!!! I love this place so much!!!! I'm a healthy eater and hate sodas or anything tastes artificial. I buy 5 at a time and keep them in the fridge for my kids and of course one for myself before the gym! The staff here are very friendly! Location is great so that's no reason to try another store!"}
{"text":"First timer. Stopped here omw home from work. Drive thru was empty. Ordered a Pure bowl came out to over $9.00. Delicious... but the bowl is small and the toppings are skimpy. Will stick to Juice N Go."}
{"text":"I loved this little restaurant! I had the hummus bowl and my friend had the chicken gyro bowl. Both were incredibly delicious. The ingredients used were SO fresh. I can tell the Greek yogurt sauce is made in-house, and it was very fresh and garlicky. I also had a Tiger Eye nut mylk (I think that's what it's called - it's not on the menu yet), which was a healthier alternative to horchata. It was delicious and not overwhelmingly sweet. The workers were so sweet and answered all my questions about the food. I also loved how eco-conscious the restaurant was with plastic they used and the environmental programs they support.  If you are craving something healthy and fresh, definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"I love the theme and food but the drive through was slow and menu was kinda weird. I had to park and wait awhile for just 2-3 things.   It is fresh juice but I could not see it made and worried with so much business how the cleanliness is. Assume it's good but it would be hard to keep up with all that fresh preparation.   I've only been once but it does get a 4 star from me.   I got several juices and a lemonade I liked them all.   You can call in your order which is highly recommended when getting more than one item especially. Hopefully they expand or refined the speed of the drive through. I will update my review if I do go again and see any improvements.   Thanks and good luck Fruits and Roots on Sunset Rd!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I wish they had one closer to me but I drive here just for their bowls and smoothies. They are must haves!!! I get \"The Island Bowl\" and it's amazing!!! If you want a smoothie \"The Gummi Bear\" is delicious! So good you crave it!"}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised to find a new organic spot to try for lunch. Really enjoyed talking with the owner and the other employees here. They were very transparent on the sourcing of all their ingredients, and what their restaurant was all about. I ordered the summer kale salad with chicken and I really enjoyed it. I also tried one of their organic coldpressed juices while I was there and it was delicious as well. Really happy to have a place like this in town, and I hope they do really well as I want to see the organic movement make strides here in the valley where we have such limited options. By the way, hopefully you will consider opening one on the Green Valley side of town so I don't have to travel so far"}
{"text":"It seems like it's bottled juice from the store in a cup. I thought I would get actually pressed vegetable juice not watered down bottled juice. I juice with my Breville juicer and this is far from the quality of that. For $7 for a large that is small it's not worth it to me. My vegetable juice is clear mainly water which is disappointing. Even Whole Foods has a better juice bar."}
{"text":"Finally!!!!! An all organic juice, gluten free- organic bAked goods, and organic food in Vegas:) Cute place, well organized and service was awesome! I sampled many juices and so did my 15 month old son.... And he cried for more. Also tried the gluten free ginger zucchini muffin- we both loved! This will be my new fave place."}
{"text":"I love fruits and roots. I come here quite often and get the euro bowl with all kale and no feta. It's perfect! All the flavors I love in a salad! Their pure bowl is delicious as well! However, the salad is inconsistent. Sometimes there is avocado sometimes not (it's listed as an ingredient but most of the time it's not on the salad), the chickpeas are always different (sometimes seasoned and really crunchy sometimes unseasoned and chewy), and this most recent time the yogurt sauce was really chunky and sour. All together, I love this place and I'm sure they will work out the inconsistencies with time!"}
{"text":"My first time here and amazing food quality and service! Got my food fast which is great because I was in a rush to get my kids. The staff was very fast and friendly! They let me sample some juices which I'll have to come back for. Absolutely love the fact that it's all organic! I think people forget that this is one of the only places that's all organic. We need more places like these in Vegas."}
{"text":"On the wall, right when you walk in, there is a mission statement about the commitment this place has to educating people about eating well. On the adjacent wall is a giant mural of how various foods and spices (like ginger and turmeric) are good for you.   My husband had a Kickstarter wellness shot, which was a mix of ACV, turmeric, lemon juice, ginger and cherry, and the Protein Bowl. I had the Island Bowl. Because we were headed out to Irvine, we also got two smoothies for the road so we wouldn't have to worry about lunch. I got the large Detox and he got the Super Fruit.   First off, when we initially got there, there was only one other person inside eating a breakfast bowl. The parking lot was empty. This cafe is next to a brand spanking new development that is currently under construction. It looks like there is nothing but construction around the store but it's right off Sunset.  Second, it was a rough start. There was a lot of talking amongst the workers and it seemed like we were interrupting a gossip session. Because I was ordering what amounted to 2 meals I got a funny look. \"You want this AND that?\" was the question. \"Yes,\" I said, wondering if I needed to break into a full-blown defense of my healthy eating choices. It wasn't a slab of ribs AND a pan of lasagna, for goodness sakes.   We sat down and they brought each item out to us when it was ready. I'm not sure if this is standard operating procedure or if it was because we were the only ones in the joint. But know that only your food comes to you- you need to get up and get forks, spoons and napkins yourself. Our bowls were very good.   The young lady who originally verified my two meal decision brought out our smoothies. \"How is everything?\" she asked. From that point forward everything was peachy. Because I track my food, I asked if they had nutrition information and they said no (they are working on it), but another very kind lady behind the counter helped me with measurements of the ingredients in my bowl.   We must have come after the morning rush because one of the workers was leaving. On her way out she said good-bye to us and asked us how everything was.  All in all, a great experience with healthy, non-GMO food. I'm taking one star off for cost. For our breakfasts, one wellness shot, and lunch smoothies it was 47.00. I would rather pay the money for food I know is good for me, but (almond) Cheese N (GF) Crackers, I'm not Daddy-stinkin'-Warbucks!"}
{"text":"Incredibly friendly service in a clean and inviting space.  I ordered the acai bowl and the beet cold pressed juice, and I loved both.    I hope they start selling their granola, because the granola in the acai bowl was delicious!!     My only complaint is that I wish they had one closer to home in Summerlin!!  Try it today!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Fast food but healthy, I love the concept. They have a drive thru that's really fast and they also have a beautiful inside as well.  They have amazing juices they press every day and they also have great wellness bowls, wraps, and salad bowls.  Some of my favorite juices are 24 carrot, hot potato, and cashew cream. They also have juices if your feeling sick and help you kick that bug! Also they have this amazing vegan cheesecake  and it's \"dressed\" so it has strawberry sauce and fruit on top, you have to get this one quick though because it's very popular!!!  The staff is super sweet and they let you sample any juices or food if you want to try something new!  They have WiFi so you can definitely sit in have a coffee and work on your computer!   Always love coming here and will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I am so happy this place finally opened up! I am obsessed with the one on sunset and now this one is closer! They do an amazing job!   I love getting their wellness bowls and the pure one is my favorite it's made with a√ßai! They add some of the best house made granola I have ever had!   Their wraps and salad bowls are really yummy too. Everything is fresh that day and they source a lot of their ingredients from farms out here in Las Vegas! My favorite is build your own wrap and I add chicken, black beans, kale (which is bomb), cucumbers, micro greens, and top it with their amazing vegan ceaser dressing. I love this dressing because it feels like actually ceaser dressing just with dairy/ egg products!   I love the layout of this place and this new store is very inviting! I will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"I wish there was an option for a 6th star!!! This place is AMAZING!!! Seriously! The food is delicious! I love the fact that it is all organic and mostly Gluten Free! This is a big selling point for my family. Love the fact the staff knows about the food and can back up their menu. I had the Hummus Wrap with Chicken, which was wonderful! My husband tried the Chicken Quinoa Salad and loved it!!! The Classic Fruit Bowl was awesome as well!!! Can't wait to go back again!!!"}
{"text":"Solid spot for healthy eating. We've always enjoyed the food but be weary of their personal website based online ordering system. Can't fault them for technical difficulties though, the food and juices are phenomenal so maybe better to call in your order or  use another platform for ordering. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Omg I love this place.  I tried it one day for breakfast, then returned for lunch and came back the next two days after.  What I like is the honesty and integrity of their ingredients.  I love a√ßa√≠ bowls, but I know a lot of place add sugar and other items not as clearly defined.  Here they are very specific on contents, and the result is so tasty.  I like the earth bowl, and sometimes add almond butter to make it more filling.  Also the cashew cream nut milk is so so so delicious.  Finally, the employees are very attentive and nice.  By the second time one of them already recognized my order.  And they are so proud of their products.  Def Italy recommend to anyone into more natural/organic food options."}
{"text":"This place has awesome juices & protein bowls! The one downfall is the prices. They're on the more expensive side. 16oz drink is $6 and an a√ßa√≠ bowl is minimum 9.50 (this is for the basic one) this is also 16oz. so the pricing is not competitive.  The location is convenient for me which is why i come back. Plus I love the freshness of everything here."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to places when I want a fresh juice. I also like the power balls that sit up front by the register. I did try the pitaya bowl was not impressed although I must say the homemade granola was the bomb! The staff is always nice and friendly and the place was clean."}
{"text":"My fav juice shop in Las Vegas  I love getting lunch here. They have the best chicken bowls/wraps and juices (especially the Nut Milks) . Their Acai Bowls are my favorite in town, the interior is also nicely put together :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in to check out this neighborhood spot I've been seeing from the highway, admiring their cute sign. I think they have a great location and hope they do really well here. I tried the Gummy Bear smoothie, a mix of pineapple, kale and cashew nut milk (I think) some other fruits that I can't remember exactly what they were now. But that's neither here nor there because - it was delicious! It's also the first time I've had a smoothie made for me {not at home} that did NOT give me a stomach ache (from too much added sugar maybe, or not being organic at other places or who knows?) I've always been leery of trying \"healthy\" smoothies made anywhere other than home, because of not being sure what's in them, but obviously they used quality ingredients and know what the body needs, and how to make it yummy. Thank you!!!  I seriously love their concept, the vibe and decor. Their outdoor patio is great & I admired their hydroponics tower gardens that gave the effect of a fountain, which was so pleasant. As I was leaving, a few guest were bringing their lunches out- and it smelled amazing. Will have to go in for a meal on the next visit!"}
{"text":"So... I've been sick as a dog with the flu for two days.   My wife got me \"The Fighter\" shot from here and it literally made me feel significantly better instantly. If you're under the weather, do yourself a favor and get this lifesaver, it's amazing."}
{"text":"First of all, there is no need to ambush your customers when they walk in the door. Let a mf read the menu without getting a comprehensive lesson on your locally sourced triple filtered cold pressed water.   Secondly, when I order a lemonade I would love to actually have some lemons/lemon juice in there, not the essence of a lemon that maybe laid next to the strawberry that was pulverized (GREEN STEM AND ALL!) into my water. Fuh, I realize it'll taste a little different if I get it without the sweetener but I at least expected it to taste a little bit like a sour lemonade instead of left over melted ice water.   C of all, I don't really care if your ingredients are sent over here via helicopter from the remote corners of the world, there is no reason a small container of any juice should cost $9 when you can literally get the same thing for half the price at Pressed Juicery.   I wish I could give negative stars. But alas, here we are. If you're looking to get rid of some cash, may I suggest just burning it instead of purchasing anything here."}
{"text":"This is my first time trying fruits and roots! I was in the mood for a healthy smoothie not so much a jamba or trop smoothie so I decided to give fruits and roots a try. I was pleasantly satisfied from the moment I walked in, was kinda greeted and asked if it was my first time. I could tell by the atmosphere this is exactly what I had in mind. After looking over the menu I decided to go with the Mint Chip. And let me let you for there not being any chocolate it sure tasted like there was! There were a ton of other items I would like to try in the future (this review is only based off the smoothies) I look forward to making my second trip back in the near future!"}
{"text":"I was in the area for work and needed a healthier option for lunch.  I looked it up on Yelp and this place popped up.  A lot of good healthy options.  If I lived here this would be my go-to place for healthy fast food."}
{"text":"The food so delicious.. place rocks. The decor makes you feel awesome .. staff super cool and helpful... I will for sure be back !! Go people go .. they have two locations .."}
{"text":"Great food and quality! Loved the Island a√ßa√≠ bowl with an orchid on top. Downer that the large latte was around $10 so not going every single day but the ingredients were fresh and wholesome so I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Simple ingredients with a lot of flavor. Had a chicken quinoa salad and Refresh for the pressed juice and I enjoyed both. I actually hate ginger but I couldn't taste it at all in the pressed juice. Pricey for the amount of food you get but you have to consider they still need to make a profit and natural ingredients expire faster than processed foods. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing health bar with tons of options. All gluten free which I love. Just never come here In a hurry. They take quite a while to make delicious food. Seems to be very understaffed for the amount of customers they have inside and through the drive thru. They have wraps, juices, smoothies, and so much more. I've never had anything I didn't like here. Some have a unique blend, but it all works so well together!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I seriously don't understand why they close at 6pm. I would love to stop and pick up a bowl and juice for dinner."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place. Love the decor and atmosphere. Super nice that they have a drive thru.   As for the juice...   I bought 2 Cashew Creams... DIVINE!! What a treat and I cannot wait to try the others! Nice addition to the Southwest!  *UPDATE*  Went back for the second time and ordered another cashew cream. It was disappointing  because it was slightly above room temperature and gave the drink a completely different taste. What a bummer!  I'll be back but I will make sure the juice I'm purchasing is cold."}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp after wanting a healthy smoothie. Such a cute clean and healthy place. Our smoothies were made with the freshest ingredients. Large variety of juices and fresh fruits and vegetables. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I kept passing by this place thinking I should try it sometime so on a Saturday afternoon I finally did. I was very impressed with the variety of juices, wraps salads and acai bowls! Everything looked great. I finally settled on a protein bowl and farm green juice. Both were far better than anything I've tried elsewhere. The staff was friendly, the service was quick, and the place is clean, airy and bright. Will be coming back agaib"}
{"text":"I always order the chicken gyro bowl with a side of the creamy avocado ($11.50) and my partner orders the chicken Quinoa bowl (9.50) and she enjoys it.   Whatever they put in the bowl it all goes together. I love the crunch from the toasted chickpeas.   As far as the service they're friendly here.   You'll just have to come in and try it for yourself, it's really good"}
{"text":"I've visited this spot again and have experienced great customer service. They have bubbly and knowledgeable staff. The owner was in contact with me after my first review and she's been pretty outstanding. She truly cares to provide everyone with an exceptional experience and encouraged me to visit them again. That's really awesome.   If you're on the go like I am, they have a drive-thru where you can get your healthy grub and hit the road with a fresh juice, wellness shot or latte in hand.  I read another review stating they had espresso and swung by here to get my morning caffeine fix. The drive-thru option is great and I really enjoyed my iced vanilla latte with cashew milk and espresso. Yes, they have cashew milk as an option and I love it!  I will always order almond, coconut or cashew if they have dairy alternatives. The latte was super refreshing.  It wasn't full of junk and it was lightly sweetened with agave. It's bit pricier than your typical Starbucks (rightly so).  You're going to pay a small premium for quality and I'm totally fine with that. I will pay more for the wholesome ingredients when I'm cutting out the junk.  I loved my latte and will be back to treat-myself again.  I will have to try a lunch here in the near future. Go ahead, treat-yo self to some healthy goodness. They're easily accessible and may be found off the 215 and Buffalo in the Southwest."}
{"text":"Fruits and Roots is right across the street from my work so I figured I would give it a try for breakfast. I was in the mood for a smoothy and some fruit. Just so happens, this place had both! Score! I ordered the super fruit smoothy and the fruit snack.   First the good.       Drive through place with healthy food..about time we got one of those in Spring Valley. The fruit snack had really fresh apples, pineapple, and bananas it was delicious, it even came with a little bit of greek yogurt to dip your fruit in!  Second the meh,       I guess I am out of the smoothy loop these days or didn't read the menu carefully enough cause I figured a super fruit smoothie would taste fruity.....It tasted like ground tree bark, \"super root smoothy\" would have been a more accurate name for it. It was a slightly disturbing brown/green/mud color (check out the picture). I even had some co-workers taste it to make sure I was not just having an off day and they agreed that it was not very pleasant. I guess that may be on me for not really knowing what I was ordering, or it is entirely possible that I may have accidentally got someone else's order by mistake and got some off the wall smoothy with different ingredients than i expected. Definitely will not be ordering that one again, that taste really took me by surprise. But I still finished the entire thing because I am stubborn and did not want to waste any bit of a $15 dollar breakfast, which brings me to the cost. Around $15 for both items, that is $15 for a 14 oz. fruit smoothy and maybe a half an apple, a quarter pineapple, 1/2 a banana and maybe 2 oz of greek yogurt in the \"Fruit snack\". I felt at that price it better be top notch, which the \"fruit snack\" was, but the super fruit smoothy missed the mark by a long shot. If I ever decide to go back and try Fruits and Roots again I think I am going to stick with the Juices. Judging by all of the good reviews, that looks like the way to go."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place! I give this place 10 stars!   Practically everything is made from organic ingredients. Service is amazing! I love the girls who work here. They are super sweet & welcoming. They look good too. Hmmm.. must be what they/re consuming (wink)  If you want to tip them for their remarkable service, their tips go to a good cause. There's a basket by the door for your used bottles. I like that! Helping out the environment. 2 thumbs up!!   If you're like me somedays & don't feel like getting down & have a teen, preteen & 2 babies in the car that you don't feel like taking out of the car seat, there's a drive thru which is a major plus. You can even call in your order if you want to.   All the salads are delicious! I have tried every one & you can make it into a wrap. My favorite is the chicken gyro salad.It's perfect! But that homemade granola that they put in their fruit bowls tho! So addicting!I All their bowls are so good! I remember when I was pregnant, I needed a bowl every day. I almost cried because the one thing that is a displeasure of this restaurant is that it closes on Sunday. Boo! Other than that, this place is the best."}
{"text":"I haven't tried too many things on the menu as I've never had a bad experience with their smoothies, so I stick to those! Love the mint chip and maca-choco smoothies the most. The immunity shot works for me too. Staff are always friendly but there can be a bit of a wait sometimes (as everything seems to be made fresh) so make sure you give yourself 10-15 mins at peak times."}
{"text":"Sometimes these trendy juice places have the most judgmental, rude workers. But the service here was great. They were nice and answered my questions without making me feel stupid. I'm so excited that they are the same prices as other juice places but they are *ORGANIC*!! I had the kale and strawberry wrap in addition to my smoothie and it was so yummy!! Oh and the drive through is amazing when I'm rushing to work!!"}
{"text":"The new vegan cheesecake is to die for! That's worth it for the trip here alone. This is still my favorite place to meet with friends and do something good for my body!"}
{"text":"I wish they had a location closer to me. They serve great quality ingredients and make their own granola for their acai bowls!"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and just seems that the service is getting worse every time.  Waited about 10 minutes just to order when there was no one in front of me and there was only two employees behind counter. The lady kept working the drive-thru window until the lady behind me started to complain and she finally took my order.    Waited another 25 minutes just for order and we ordered the Island bowl, Glow Bowl and chicken wrap. Food was delicious as always. Prices are decent.   It is not the employees fault for only scheduling two employees that's owner problem. The employees were friendly even when other complained and saw them working hard."}
{"text":"I found a gem today while on my way to pahrump!  So so good. The staff are so nice and friendly. I prefer this better than pressed juice.  And the cashew smoothie are so good. And they had me tried the cashew with espresso omg! To die for.  I will be going there once a week at least when i visit vegas!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Took my daughter and her friend after school. They really enjoyed the fresh food and the clean environment. Customer service was amazing . Prices are fair , we will be returning very soon."}
{"text":"Nice place to get some work done as it's quiet and not that crowded. I didn't get to try any of their juices, but I got their iced green tea with honey and it was refreshing & sweet."}
{"text":"So good!!! I loved it. Located right off 215 and buffalo. It's kind of in the middle of nowhere, but definitely worth the drive. You can tell the ingredients they use are so fresh, the flavors really pop, the quality is good. They have juices, and food. I went with the chicken gyro salad and let me tell you.. one of the best salads I have ever had!! Also for your convenience, they have a drive thru. So yummy"}
{"text":"Lots of good stuff. Nothing great. On the plus side: the atmosphere is cool, and they carry juices, smoothies, acai bowls, some \"pastry\" type items, and actual food like sandwiches and salads. On the minus side: everything's expensive, there are only a couple smoothies to choose from, the fruit bars aren't really very tasty or very healthy, and the acai bowls are runny (actually, I'm no acai bowl connoseiur...not sure if they're supposed to be runny or frozen, like sorbet, but I prefer the ones I've had that are frozen). So if it's close to your house...and you have want juice plus a salad...then I would go. But if you just want a smoothie, I would probably go to Jamba juice (you can get protein ones there, too). If you want some healthy pastries, you seriously have to go to Great Grubbin on St. Rose. There the stuff is packed with protein, low carb, and actually tastes like a real pastry. And if you want an acai bowl....well, I can't help you. Maybe then you should stick to FNR!"}
{"text":"Never thought I'd have pressed cucumber, kale, ginger, carrot and apple smoothie for lunch but I tried it and it didn't taste like grass and dirt like I thought it would, it was actually great!  The staff is friendly and helpful and the menu is interesting.  I'm going back!  KG"}
{"text":"I'm gonna happily update my review to the 5 stars I would have loved to give the first time had I had a 5 star experience. I came back for a post workout meal and was more than pleased with my service. It's nice to get greeted with a smile. And of course an additional five stars for the chicken gyro bowl and the strawberry mint lemonade that I am absolutely in love with. Craving satisfied :)"}
{"text":"We drive by Fruits and Roots almost daily and we finally decided to give it a try. Unfortunately the only good thing I have to say about the place is it has nice decor. We walked in and was greeted by one of the girls and as we were looking at the menu she asked if it was our first time and we told her yes. We assumed she would explain the menu but nope! My daughter's go to is a strawberry banana smoothie and the menu had a few smoothies that had strawberry and banana mixed with other stuff and I asked if they would be able to make one with just strawberry and banana and she had said they couldn't because it was already pre made. So we continued to look at the menu and a different girl came and said she would be able to make the smoothie so thank you to her. My husband and I knew we wanted to get an acai bowl so as we looked at the different options we found one we wanted to try but on the menu it had a pitaya and we asked if we could get it with acai instead but again was told that it was already pre made. So we went with one that was made with acai but it had blueberries which we don't like and we weee hesistant to ask if they would be able to leave them out since everything seemed to be pre made but my husband did ask and luckily she said they could leave it out. Whew! It wasn't a long wait to get our order. My daughter drank her smoothie saying it was okay and our acai bowl was okay as well. To me the best part was the granola and that's about it. At least we can say we finally tried this place and we definitely won't be back. We will be sticking to our usual spot Bowlology!"}
{"text":"Ordered the ginger tea with agave syrup. Refreshing and light. Not a sweet drink, just right on flavor. Large drink 5 and change."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a healthy place to go that doesn't taste like \"health\" this is a great place! Ive tried other places in town and they don't come close to how good fruit and roots is!   I've tried: (off the top of my head) 24 carrot, gummy bear, mint chip, banana bread, acai bowl with whey, chicken quinoa bowl and all are excellent choices! There's plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Everything is always neat, clean and orderly.    There's only one suggestion I have, encase, glue down or replace the back of the seating glass bottles. I have two kids, they love it but I hate it. Children and broken glass is just a nightmare waiting to happen.   Thank you for this amazing, healthy place for my family, friends and I to enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Drive thru?!? Who would've ever thought of a healthy drive thru option? Best thing ever! Friendly staff, amazing food, and the juices are great for a pick me up or an intense cleanse."}
{"text":"Seriously??? Put one of these in GVR area of Henderson please! This place would go over like gang busters!!  Stopped by the other day on my way to Ikea, was so pleased with the interior, black chalkboard wall with chalk drawings of veggies and fruits. White subway tile lines back walls with large commercial refrigerators and an attractive greens bar (similar to a salad bar, but the workers make the dishes).  They offer coffee and acai bowls, pressed juices and smoothies, nut milks, and at this location, scrumptious salad combos.  What I find so admirable in comparison to other juiceries is this place is all organic! The price for a 13 oz juice is $8, whereas the price for a 16 oz juice at other local juice places is $12 or more! But this one is all organic everything, which I can appreciate paying the $8 for a clean, organic juice. Let's be honest that drinking any juice, organic or not, will be healthier than going without the vitamin packed beverage, but if given the option, I prefer organic.  This place is clean and well-maintained and even has a drive thru.  The worker behind the counter was very helpful and considerate when I asked if she could add some extra ginger to my green juice.  Will def return, but guys, put one in over in the GVR area, I think it would do quite well!"}
{"text":"These folks are clean they have great customer service and the acai bowl was yummy.  They also off for salads, customize salads. Juices, wellness shots, protein bowls, and wrap sandwiches."}
{"text":"I love this place. Fast Service and very vegan friendly. They also try their best to reduce waste which is great! They have plastic made from corn so it is compostable. I love when places try their best to take care of our mother earth. They also have a drive through, which is awesome for a juice place."}
{"text":"I love this place but the last couple of times I have gone to get my usually order- including a small \"gummy bear\" its barely blended. I keep finding giant chunks of frozen banana. They are delicious but my mouth definitely got a workout trying to drink it.. much too thick :(! Please just take the time to blend guys! I will still be back :)"}
{"text":"I love this place! The drive thru definitely makes it convenient for early morning breakfast needs. The smoothies and acai bowls are awesome delicious and fresh. Price wise they're reasonable and comparable to the other juice/smoothie bars on vegas."}
{"text":"A very hot day today..stopped in my first time here.  I asked the counter person what he would recommend I have a bit of a upset tummy and he said something with ginger. I got a sample of a juice with ginger and bite of heat to it..I feel better already! In the meantime I also got a smoothie with coconut water..strawberry..ginger..and greek yogurt.  Very good service and a very nice place..great decor..music and friendly atmosphere.  Locally owned I found out too. Thank you for coming to the southwest ..we needed it! I will be back."}
{"text":"helloooo!!!! This food is SO good! It is a bit pricey... but its worth it. The customer service is a littleee cheeky, but they all seem happy and the food is consistently served. I like the shakes a lot, I had the cacao one (cant remember name) and mint chip. Both good.   For an idea on price, expect to pay $12 for a salad, about $2 more for the wrap, another $2 for chicken. Thats a $16 chicken wrap O_O - and the shakes are also about $10. So, before you know it, you've spent $30 on... wait...   But really, it IS very good. Just not for the faint of heart of pocket :)"}
{"text":"Again, another overpriced place, the second they label their business as a healthy store/restaurant, they think it makes it soooo okay for them to bump up their prices, I got a simple chicken bowl, with veggies and chicken for $12.80!!! Everything is extremely overpriced and they don't give you enough food for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Amazing juice and healthy food options! Everything here is organic and delicious!! This is exactly what we need in Vegas, hearty, healthy and tasty all in one! I would definitely recommend this  juice bar for any meal or snack.  You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is awesome! Loved the acai bowl and the chicken gyro bowl. The menu had so many good healthy selections without being overwhelming. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Would have loved to try this place today and it says on Yelp that it's open... however the hours posted on the door says it's not even open on Sundays and it is Sunday. This is at the Sunset location. I'll still attempt the Blue Diamond location, but on some other day."}
{"text":"I love the concept. Staff was friendly and it's a nice place... I was hoping to love this place but was disappointed with the a√ßai bowl. I've had many in the past from other places. The one I ordered today had absolutely no flavor. I mean it literally tasted like I was eating a non-flavored smoothie... The ones I've had in the past I gobbled down Because it was so tasty. All the ingredients were nice and fresh but it definitely needs SOME kind of flavor!!! I understand they are not loading it up with fake sugar but it's missing something!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times now, and the food is always delicious, but service is always slow. I had to take a short lunch last Friday, so I thought I'd go through the drive-thru at F&R for a quick bit. Wrong. I was stuck in the drive through for twenty minutes during my 30min lunch. $13 for a wrap is a bit much when you don't have time to eat it. Delicious? YES! But not worth the wait. I also had an upset stomach afterwards, not sure if that was F&R food or not, maybe a coincidence. However, the weight for drive-thru is rediculous. If you're short on time make sure to call your order ahead of time, but I wish they would have at least appologize for the wait."}
{"text":"This new location has still not caught its stride in week four, however it's a good place for healthy food, coffees and juices.  Operational Inefficiency: super slow on preparing pre made Food into a bowl, as well as coordinating which employee plays which role (preparer, check out..)  The food is super fresh. In my two visits with my mother, I tried various dishes but my favorite is the Caesar bowl. Good ingredients, vegan dressing and a filling portion for $11! It was a few extra bucks to add chicken.   Caffeinated drinks have the option for cashew milk. Be prepared to dish out if you get cashew milk ($9 here - this is more expensive than NYC FYI). I will say it's well worth it, since there aren't too many places with this item in the area.   Juices are good and fresh. They allow for samples, if you're unsure of which one you'd like to go with!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened this store in December, verses their 1st location on sunset (only because it's closer to my house) and the staff is always friendly I've never been a huge health addict but I've been trying to change my diet, habits, etc, and some of the staff gives me tips and pointers on how to do that. You can tell by the warm welcomes and smiling faces the staff at both of their locations actually enjoys working there."}
{"text":"Love love love the food and smoothies (customer service isn't too bad either), but it seems like the prices have gone up since they opened. I totally get organic produce is more expensive (and I'm a huge believer in it), but when I pay 12 bucks for a salad and it's in a small bowl (and mostly kale) I am hesitant. I will continue to come back for juice and smoothies though"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! the vanilla latte is sooo good the people here are the sweetest great place to go in every aspect"}
{"text":"Was craving fresh juice and a√ßa√≠ bowl before heading into work and Fruit and Roots was open early (yay!)   This healthy kitchen is warm and welcoming. I love their attention to detail (world lamp, Vegas strong mural). The staff was friendly and educational.   The a√ßa√≠ bowl was sooo delicious! Packed with granola, blueberries and more. Chocolate almond milk was delicious as well.   Only con is the juices are a little pricery than other juice places."}
{"text":"Went to the original location and tried it again, this time I found the place to be wayyy better than the first experience. Food was really good, chicken gyro, and the vegan gluten free walnut bread was amazing. Had a couple of their shakes and I have to say, I'm really impressed. The service was also good."}
{"text":"Was my first time visiting this establishment.  The wait time was fairly long so calling in your order prior if you are on a time crunch would be recommended.  I had the gyro salad with chicken.  The chicken was amazingly tasty and spicy. The Greek yogurt dressing was a nice compliment and added a cooling effect.  Salad itself was pretty standard except for the toasted chick peas.  My beverage choice was the pressed pre bottled apple lemon and extra ginger.   Was tart and spicy from the apples and ginger.   The price was about 22.50 sorta high for what you get.  I would still frequent this establishment because it was very good.  Negatives are the price and wait time."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit here and the Ginger iced tea blew me away! Delicious!!!!  The girl that rung me out was so sweet and helped me choose the best salad to fit my paleo diet needs. I felt so welcomed. Customer service is fantastic! And they have a drive thru! I'm so excited to try new things out soon."}
{"text":"I was finally able to check this place out. Location is low key and I love that they offer seating outdoors. Staff is friendly.  I ordered the chicken gyro wrap and was quite pleased with it. It had a very clean and flavorful taste. I think all of the ingredients go together very well. The texture of the chickpeas and the wrap itself compliments the entire wrap very nicely.  The local organic expresso was great, as well.  I love that the SW area has this go-to, all organic spot! I will definitely be back when it's time to spoil myself again!"}
{"text":"Ok so this place is legit!! I won't lie and say that it's not pricy but the flavors on their juices, smoothies, and lattes.... the best 7$ latte I've ever had!! The cashew milk is to die for!! So so good and clean!!"}
{"text":"Had a business meeting on this inside of town. Drop by to the Pure Bowl. All I can say it was amazing. Beautiful atmosphere and great customer service."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Fresh Juice and Wellness Kitchen in town! I'm a green juice convert! Thank you Patricia and the Juice crew for making my quest for good health so fun and delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this three stars because the girl at the window was very sweet and friendly. I'm so bummed though, I ordered the quinoa salad.... not only is it missing quinoa but it's also missing cucumbers. For a salad that's almost $11 from a drive thru I really want all the ingredients to be included. I'll still come back to try again though. They have very fresh ingredients and quick service."}
{"text":"The hours say until 7pm on Yelp yet at 2:00pm the are out of a lot of juices.  This shows either they do a lot of business or they don't produce enough product to support their hours.  Either way, they try to use as much organic as possible and a lot of items are Gluten Free and some even Vegan/paleo.  They do have a great selection of juices on the board, they just don't have them in the fridge; they also have a pretty good food selection.  This is the second visit here and I really want to like this place and recommend this place, it's easy for the food but as for the juice, it's hard to try them when they don't have them.    I may drive across town one more time to give this place a try.  Fortunately I do have several choices on my side so I don't need to waste the time or gas."}
{"text":"Clean nice location.  Nice staff. But very overpriced pre-made and bottled juices. (Not fresh juice)."}
{"text":"Food is good. People are nice. Hours posted mean nothing. I've been by and the hours posted say they're open but the door is locked.  Another thing is that I went by middle of day to order about $30 worth of stuff. Handed over $100 and was told that they couldn't take it. Had to go to the Greek place next door to get change. If you're running a business, you're there to get money. That means you should accept money. A $100 bill is money. I'm guessing that this happens often because when I went back with change they actually thanked me for coming back to pick up the food they prepared."}
{"text":"Went today for the first time. This place is definitely for the health conscious like myself. Everything, and I mean everything- as in 100% of everything they sell- is organic.   I only tried a green juice (the very green one) and a shot of wheatgrass. Both were as expected but the simple fact that they are organic is impressive. My juice had 7 or 8 ingredients btw. They have a pretty big menu too, so whether you're looking for sweet, green, or something in between I'm sure they have it. The staff was really friendly and welcoming too.   I will definitely try a bowl next time and review again, but so far so good!  Update- I tried an acai bowl (which they make fresh on the spot) and it was DELICIOUS. I really didn't expect it to be as good as it was. Looking forward to trying a chicken wrap next time. I have also tried two more juices and they were both awesome. This is definitely my new favorite stop in the area, and the staff are all top notch."}
{"text":"I thought I would stop by here after leaving the Baguette Cafe, just so I could scratch it off my list. It was just down the street so we grabbed a couple of juices.  The store was clean, but some of the table tops could have used a wipe down. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. Unfortunately it is just another over priced juice bar to me. $18 for two juices that were not even juiced to order. They were juiced early that morning, so I was told. The juice was good, but if I am paying $9 per drink, I would like to see the ingredients be fed into the juicer.  We tried the 24 Carrot and the Apple Spice. The Apple Spice had apples, ginger, and lemon. The 24 carrot was apples, carrots, and ginger.  Both drinks were good, but I am giving three stars because they don't juice your drinks to order."}
{"text":"I can't say enough how much I love this place!! I always get the Pure Bowl (acai, bananas, granola, strawberries, and seeds). The staff is nice and helpful. I totally take advantage of their drive thru when I'm on the go (cute guy working btw LOL) Everything made fresh to order. Looking forward to try out some more items on menu."}
{"text":"Love this Place!!! I am addicted to the Summer Kale Bowl!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best place I have been , there food is  so fresh and the juices to die for I would go there againg"}
{"text":"Way overpriced. Good quality juices but nothing that makes me not want to get juices from Pressed Juicery for half the price."}
{"text":"I'm giving the food and drinks a 5 because they make some of the healthiest foods taste like I'm indulging in something I shouldn't be. The service on the other hand is why I'm docking a star...everyone is friendly, but kind of slow and inattentive. After ordering in the drive thru I sat about 4 minutes without them even opening the window to at least let me know she'll be right with me. Not sure how many people were inside so I'll just pretend they are busy because I really like what they have to offer.   On the plus side, they were able to give me some cut up strawberries and bananas for my kids. So much better than getting fast food for them when they need a snack on the go."}
{"text":"This has become my favorite health food place. I was there yesterday.  Forgot to take pictures of my juice .i had the Ginger Mylk (Iced) Organic House-Made Cashew Mylk, Organic Ginger Root, Organic Maple Syrup. Everything is fresh and tastes great.  The Blue Diamond location is new.  Clean. Trendy.  I did not rate it 5 stars because it's pretty pricey.  My Cashew Mylk drink was $12 and they close at 6pm.  Not a place I would visit for more than once a week because of the prices."}
{"text":"My favorite juice bar to go out of my way to visit -- at least once a week!  What I love about Fruits and Roots is its knowledgeable staff, the fact that it offers samples before purchase and a super convenient drive thru if you're on the go!  Admittedly, I've only tried a handful of the juices (my favorite being the 24 Carrot) and all of the wellness shots (which work better than aspirin on a hangover LOL), but the friendly service and the information provided by the cashiers to meet my daily needs is the reason I keep going back to try something new.  Also chock full of tasty snacks, salads and caffeinated drink options, I'm sure I'll be spending even more of my free time here."}
{"text":"A bit on the pricier side for a juice bar but as long as they are truly sticking to their organic theme, I'm okay with paying more for quality. I came here for bfast and ordered the protein bowl and ginger tea with agave. The protein bowl filled me up and I liked that there was granola both on the top and bottom so I ran out of toppings, there were still \"bottomings\" lol. I do wish there were more bananas and strawberry toppings though since it costs almost $10. The ginger tea was strong in ginger flavor which was great. I also took home a bottle of kombucha, which is pretty affordable compared to grocery stores.   Overall, I'll come back occasionally due to pricing."}
{"text":"Found this place close to my office and this is my second visit.  The first time I got a salad and it was really fresh and good size portion.  This time I decided to try their Acai pure bowl.  The bowl was good but so far none can compare with Blue Bowl in Orange County, Ca. I think I am spoiled permanently for any other place.  But a star for their staff and customer service, nice and helpful!  This location have great employees.  I wish all establishments had such pleasant and caring people who seem to take pride in their job."}
{"text":"Unbelievably over priced..... Doesnt matter how good people say it is, its just like starbucks, just overpriced.... period...."}
{"text":"This is the closest juicing place near my house. I've been to several but this is probably my favorite because they actually have food lol!   their juices and smoothies are really good. They always taste super fresh. I prefer the nut milks over the juices. My favorite thing on the menu is their chicken gyro salad. Holy moly, that stuff is amazing! They say that their stuff is organic & it taste healthy so I'm gonna say that it's probably organic.   It can get pretty pricey, as do a lot of juicing places. But you're paying for quality & good customer service!"}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes! This place is the perfect combination of healthy, fresh and delicious! I got the immunity shot and the gyro salad and it was delish! I'll be back tomorrow morning to try and A√ßa√≠ bowl. Yum!"}
{"text":"My new favorite healthy spot!!!  While I cheat here and there, most of my diet is pretty healthy and the main thing I keep out of my diet is added sugar.  This place does not add any sugar to their foods.    I ordered the Pure Acai Bowl. OMG!  Frozen-blended acai bowl with bananas, strawberries, blackberries and pumpkin-seed granola.  Since there's no sugar added you're depending more on the actual sweetness from the fruit which I find more pleasant.    Can't wait to go back and try some of their fresh-pressed juices!"}
{"text":"Was craving an a√ßa√≠ bowl the other day and stopped by this place based off of the reviews. AMAZING. The quality compared to other places I have been to recently is obvious. Their granola is life. They include a generous amount of it in their bowls in addition to fresh fruits. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really expensive and small portioned . I really love how every ingredient is organic though. I went thru the drive thru my smoothie was over $11 dollars and the girl wasn't too helpful with the menu. My smoothie was gone in two sips."}
{"text":"Acai bowl was pretty decent, have to get used to it in a way, quite different tasting from anything out there."}
{"text":"I love juice and smoothie places and yes i know they are not the most affordable option but, there usually is a norm of price. This place was a but above the norm. I had the ginger juice and while it was delicious i didnt think the price warranted the taste. I also had the gyro salad that was delicious really liked it. Yes the dressing is thick as the other reviews say but its still good. What i loved the most and is what kept my rating up if the drive thru option. You dont see many juice place with drive thru, definitely worth it to come back just for the convenience."}
{"text":"I'm impressed...stopped in this place for the first time today. Friendly customer service. Great options on the menu. I ended up ordering a custom wrap and an ice tea. Everything was perfect and was delicious.  I really like this place a lot. They do have a drive thru as well. This is definitely my go to place. If you want something organic and vegan stop in here. A++"}
{"text":"This place is amazing ! Everything is organic and fresh, went through the drive thru a few times and service is always friendly and quick. The first time i went here, one of the girls recommended the \"ginge and juice\" she said it was their most popular juice. It had a kick to it  due to the extra ginger but I loved it. The prices are fair considering everything is organic and fresh. I will definitely continue to go here."}
{"text":"Fruits N Roots is simply amazing! I not only look forward to the food but to the juices as well! It's my favorite way to start my morning and they are conveniently located right around the corner from my office. The Strawberry Mint Tea and Pure Bowl are my favorites! My 3 year old is OBSESSED with the Gummy Bear which makes me SO happy that she finds something healthy for her so delicious! I recently did one of the cleanses and felt amazing after! The juices in my cleanse were delicious and unlike any other cleanse that seems like torture to go through! The staff is always so kind and attentive! Patricia, the owner, is one of the sweetest most caring people I have met! She truly cares about each customer and their well being. I highly recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and had great experiences, so I tell my coworkers we should order lunch from here. The first time we did an online order, I went to pick up and they let me know there were no online orders and asked if I ordered at blue diamond. I hadn't but stepped aside to make sure when she goes, \"oh here it is\".  I work retail and know how online orders work, I also know what I would say if I had forgot to check for online orders. The food is good so we tried again the next day. We ordered a couple bowls, a smoothie and a vegan cheesecake. One bowl had cacao nibs added to it which were paid for but not present in the bowl. Most disappointing is the cheesecake was frozen! Why? Why would you even tell people you have them available if you had literally just taken them out of the freezer. They also pre-make all the bowls so you can't change or sub anything. That makes it seem not so fresh. We'll try the other location next time."}
{"text":"If you're looking for something fast & cheap, this is not the place to go to. If you have some time on your hands, money & love delicious healthy foods/drinks then definitely try this place out. The juices are good. The people that work here are nice. The prices are a little expensive but they have the best acai & pitaya bowls I've ever had. Their homemade granola is amazing! I feel the quality of this place is absolutely worth giving it a try. Just make sure you've got some time on your hands because it is a bit of a wait, even in the drive thru."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Everyone was so nice and helpful. I ordered a protein a√ßai bowl and it was exactly what I needed. 25 g of protein! The granola is amazing. Love this place."}
{"text":"I just went there for the first time and I am so impressed I can't wait to go back! Everything on the menu sounds so healthy and delicious, their juice was incredible!! I ordered one of their power bowls and devoured it within just a few minutes! I highly recommend this place for anyone looking to eat healthy but also eat food that tastes fantastic! Nutritious and delicious should be their slogan"}
{"text":"UPDATE: Patricia, the owner, took my critique constructively & invited me to return & retry the Pure Bowl. I did so today... She explained they had sampled a different brand of a√ßa√≠ the day I first gave them a try. So I retried the Pure Bowl & yes, there was a definite difference from my first experience. I could taste the a√ßa√≠ & it was perfect, not too sweet or bland. I also loved that the bananas were so ripe. Too often, restaurants use bananas that aren't ready yet & there is an obvious difference in taste. There is also a complete difference between bowls that use produce with GMOs versus those that use all organic produce. I love that I'm reassured that this place is organic with every bite. My a√ßa√≠ bowl today also reminded me of how delicious their granola is! Thank you Patricia for contacting me & convincing me to give the bowl another shot. You've just gained a new regular :)  The more & more I come here, the more I love it!!!"}
{"text":"Ever since discovering Acai bowls in Hawaii I've fallen in love with them.  I'm glad to finally see there are places in Vegas selling Acai bowls!  This place is located right off the 215 and it's very easy to miss because nobody really gets off Buffalo, and I'm kicking myself for not coming in until now!  I ordered the pure bowl because I wanted a classic Acai bowl and it was great.  I'm glad the granola was at the bottom because usually everything is at the top and it gets hard to mix.  The blueberries and strawberries were fresh as well.  The banana was ripe too!  Only thing is since Acai bowls are limited in Vegas, you don't get too much bang for your buck like you would in Cali or Hawaii.  I'm guessing it has to do with shipping costs or something, BUT from what I understand everything is organic so I'll pay the price.  This place is also about 3 minutes away from EOS fitness on Durango so it's perfect for a post workout snack.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"I came here before working an event nearby. I was under the impression it was a fresh juicebar where juices are made to order but their juices are pre-made and bottled. I ordered the Beet juice. It was good, but definitely pricey, $10 for bottled juice. The cashier was extremely friendly and let me try a sample before buying which was very nice. I just thought I was going to get fresh juice."}
{"text":"This place is so good! Best juice bar in Las Vegas. All organic cold pressed green juice my favorite!   The food is really good too. I really enjoyed how you can build your own salads, perfect every time. And, those health paleo power balls for dessert are the bomb!!"}
{"text":"My fav spot for the acai bowls :) there's something about the granolas that makes it so yummy, I love it!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to stop in here for a while now and finally had a day that worked out for my sister and I. When you first walk in you can't help but look at all the decor. Very well put together and very clean! Tons of room to sit and even has a little seating area for kids which worked out perfect for my daughter who enjoyed sitting at a little table her size. When we went to order the staff was very friendly and helpful with any questions we had. My sister and I both got the Pure Bowl and it was delicious! We both absolutely loved it! We will be coming back soon and will be telling our friends and family about it. If you haven't been you should definitely check them out!"}
{"text":"Such nice staff and the best juices ever!! They have so many options and good prices for juices!!! Try the vegan chicken wrap!!"}
{"text":"Solid Acai bowl venue.  I went with the:  Island Bowl $9.50 - Pitaya, Coconut Water, Mango , Banana, Strawberry, Blueberry, Banana, House made granola and Coconut.   I was debating between 3 and 4 stars but what I really liked was how they had granola on the top layer and also at the bottom. Nice surprising touch to have the bottom layer which you don't see at all Acai spots."}
{"text":"Pros: Great juice, excellent bowls!!! + FRESH lemonade.  Cons: Drive through, inconsistency, lil pricey  I've been going to fruits and roots over the past year or so because it's literally across the street from my house and I LOVE it. That being said like any other place it has its faults which are totally understandable. I would not recommend going through the drive through if you need to get a bowl or if someone else is in front of you. It just takes such a long time. This isn't their fault at all it just sucks when the person in front of you orders 3 bowls and you're waiting for let's say a juice. That'll be a 15 minute wait easily. Other fault, sometimes I feel like maybe they don't have enough people? There's been times I've ordered to go and when I get there 10-15 minutes later to pay they're barely starting it. Lastly, inconsistency. There are days my bowls feel heaven sent and there are days I think about giving this place one star because I just paid $11 for a bowl that wasn't even filled up and sloppily done. However this place is fresh and clean and for the majority do a good job so I keep coming back.   Def worth a try, after a workout or as a little snack!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for! Everything is made in house from organic ingredients. And it's all good. If you love smoothies you'll love this place."}
{"text":"Fresh and not artificially sweetened. The healthiest a√ßa√≠ bowl I've had and beautiful to look at as well. A complete sensory experience.  The drive through makes this a perfect health stop.  The 24 carrot juice over ice is so good on a hot day."}
{"text":"Since my husband and I are eating Paleo now we were so excited to try this place out. It was definitely a lifesaver for us because we needed some quick snacks to bring with us to the hospital, since we were visiting with a sick relative. What we picked up: Almond Cacao, Power Balls (chocolate, lemon cream, blueberry, snickerdoodle), 24 Carrot, Popeye green, and some Paleo compliant banana bread! Love how all the ingredients are listed and if not you can ask one of the workers, the girl that helped us was very patient. Loved everything we bought. Too bad there wasn't a place like this closer to home in CA. If we are back in the area I would definitely come back here again for sure!  Restrooms: I didn't notice if they had one. I'm sure they do."}
{"text":"Hubby and I are happy we found Fruits and Roots. Its Fresh Organic and super delicious. Flu season is here so make sure you try their  wellness shots - yummy And the staff is very friendly. We'll definitely be going back"}
{"text":"This is seriously the best thing to come to the southwest. Love love love : )  they have the best acai bowls I've tried so far. Everything they have is super yummy and healthy. If I ever opened my own little healthy food spot (which I hope to one day) it would be something similar to this! Go and support this super cute place you won't regret it : )"}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the new food area that has recently popped up on Blue Diamond.  It's started with the sandwich shop, then the Greek restaurant and now a healthy place for salads, smoothies and sandwiches.    Fruits and Roots is already located on Sunset and it offers a great menu. I'm really looking forward to this location opening up."}
{"text":"I just moved over here and I am SO STOKED to live by this place! The atmosphere is wonderful. I love the decor, the staff, and everything feels so bright and clean. You just feel happy walking in! The staff is so knowledgeable and helpful! My first visit I got avocado toast which was freaking BOMB. I also got the powerhouse smoothie (which I probably finished in 60 seconds...not proud of it lol) It was so good! My next visit I got the mint chip smoothie, which was also yummy! Next, I'll be trying an a√ßa√≠ bowl because I hear they're delicious. I have lost 20 pounds just by eating healthy and making better choices, so this place is right up my alley. I'll probably be here once a week! I have told anyone who will listen about this place and I can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"5stars. Super tasty Acai Bowl (I got the Earth Bowl) and my daughter got the protein bowl with whey, almond butter and spinach. She discovered a chunk of unblended frozen acai berry in her bowl as she was halfway through it and they happily made her a brand new one with all the toppings - including the additional almond butter and spinach! This is GREAT BUSINESS ACUMEN and key for success! Way to go F&R!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I discovered this place not to long ago and we love it. We haven't ventured out yet and tired their food but I can tell you the fresh pressed juices are amazing. 24 Carrots is the way to go. It is pricey but you pay for what you get. Their menu is also kid friendly."}
{"text":"Drive thru! You can't beat the freshness here! Fresh ingredients daily, along with an enthusiastic, personable staff!  Casual and fast service. Comfortable seating inside and the outdoor patio.  I'm a frequent shot drinker here, and no I can't recommend just one. All are perfect, which clearly depends on your needs and wants;) Craving a protein, it's here, a smoothie, check, juices- absolutely!   I feel you get that 'bang for your buck' at Fruits & Roots.  Fruits and Roots brings healthy eating and juicing to a new wellness level."}
{"text":"Acai bowl heaven and so convenient for the mornings where u just don't want to get out of the car there is the drive through.  What I do is just call right before I drive over and order by phone, drive thru, and pay and keep it moving, sometimes in my pajamas.  Oh I got the earth bowl and the pure bowl, both bomb, but Pure bowl should be your first try of the two in my opinion. Peace!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Juice is so much better in glass jars. Food is super fresh too. When are they expanding to Scottsdale/Phoenix area?"}
{"text":"if you love healthy foods, go to the fruits and roots. very high quality foods. the chicken gyro bowl is one of my fav. a lil bit outside of vegas but u have to visit there"}
{"text":"The only reason that I am giving this place three stars is because the value does not exceed the cost. Yes the quality is good, the juices are fantastic but everything is about two dollars overpriced. The help here is very interesting, they talk too fast and you can't understand what they're saying. The menu was very confusing and if you order a bowl be sure to stand on the right side to wait for it or you will be told you're in the wrong place. It does have a lot of great reviews, but they're trying to be something that they're really not in my opinion, if that makes any sense? The main employees really think they are cool as hell. All healthy, and organic and just too cool for school. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. As a new diabetic and I recently had gall bladder surgery and gastro issues , this place saves me everyday with the detox smoothie with coconut milk . The staff are so sweet and helpful! The macro bars are amazing too!"}
{"text":"We love Patricia! We've been coming here for months now and the food is so consistently delicious. I'm so excited that we have something is healthy in Vegas.  This is our GO TO juice spot. Not only is the juice delicious, you can get it through a drive through!   Another reason we love it here is to grab a healthy salad or wrap. The owner is so talented and makes all her own dressings... The Greek yogurt dressing is stuff dreams are made of!   Thank you for opening something fast & healthy!"}
{"text":"Food Quality: 5 Taste of Food: 3-5 depending on day Consistency of food visit to visit: 1 Value For Money: 1 Staff Friendliness: 3 Staff Compitency: 2 Service Time: 1   Loved the drive through and idea of this place unfortunately I no longer feel this way. My work relocated nearby in August so I've been coming here 2-3 times a week for the last 4 months spending on average $60-$90 per week. Their service is always pretty slow (which can be understandable being that everything is freshly made) but sometimes it was ridiculous. I started getting annoyed when the Vegan Caesar wrap changed with every order. It started tasting different or missing ingredients every single time. If I'm paying $14-16 for a wrap, it better be consistent and the same as my last visit. Needless to say the constant disappointment here has made me visit less in the last few weeks.   Anyway, today I was officially over this place. I pull up, order a Banana Walnut Loaf, Green Juice and Gift Card for my friend. I wait in line for 13 minutes. YES- 13 I counted them.  So I get to the window where my total is 40 something dollars. I hand her a $100 bill. She says she can't take it. WTF- it's not like I'm ordering a $3 item. Anyway, she refuses. I pull out my card... so now she hands me my juice. It's not filled all the way. Ugh. OVER IT.  Next, gift card. The person working the window has zero clue on how to activate a \"gift card\". After waiting 13 minutes, being told I couldn't pay with the only cash I had and then getting not full juice that was the last thing I wanted to deal with.  P.s. they don't have actual gift cards/ certificates. They have some kind of Name/ Phone number system which is a NO for me. The whole set up was not very giftable. I prefer an actual gift card I can give someone not \"oh hey I got you a gift, give them my name and phone number and you can pick it up\"  Anyway, I aborted the gift card mission and left with my juice and loaf.  I've been really disappointed in a place I used to love it but lately has been fail after fail- today was my final straw and this was my final visit. My love affair with this place is over. :("}
{"text":"Tried there Gummy Bear smoothie and it is delicious! This was my first time here and never heard of the place until my co-worker/friend mentioned it to me. I wanted something healthy but also sweet so I was recommended The Gummy Bear flavor. I wont lie, the name alone made me hesitate but Im glad I went on a whim because I was not disappointed. The prices are a bit on the higher side but most places that utilize or sell organic, fresh, gluten free, healthy things are usually priced out that way. Thank you :)"}
{"text":"I got the protein Acai bowl. It was fantastic and reasonably priced (could be 5-10% less expensive.) Very clean facility and great ambiance. Friendly staff, great service. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience Alyssa made my salad which was delicious ! Stephanie the manager made my experience even better this is why I come back there so nice especially Stephanie .  And thank you for going above and beyond and solving the misunderstanding in kindness"}
{"text":"Love this place I have tried other locations.. And I must say hands down I feel great here... I enjoy the staff and the location the vibe of the store and the concept is wonderful. Plus coming from a hospitality back ground I see the passion in there products."}
{"text":"So awesome to have a all ORGANIC food & juice bar close to home! I remember when this place first opened. I use to work down the street at a salon & tried it once back then.  I highly recommend this place to anyone who's interested in great healthy food! They even have a drive thru and the workers here are super nice. Their price point is also within reason! You defiantly get your bang for you buck here!"}
{"text":"First time here. Great menu options. Wide variety of smoothies and bowls. Plenty of vegan options which I indulge in. I eat primarily raw fruits and veggies so I eat in really high quantities. The largest smoothie here is 20 ounce for around $10. When I make a smoothie at home it is usually 60 ounces. So it would cost me $30 to get a full meal worth. I know not everyone eats this way so that's just that.    As far as the dining room it is clean and spacious and modern and comfortable.  The biggest plus for us is the dog friendly patio.    All in all Fruits and Roots I would recommend. I love to see more and more plant based options becoming available all over the valley."}
{"text":"Let me just begin by saying I am not a healthy eater. I have never liked organic juices or anything super organic because it tastes like dirt to me, so I wouldn't be caught dead in Fruits & Roots because it falls into that category. However, being that my best friend works there and the owner is my former employer and i love them both, I had to support them and check it out. To start, they have a drive through; I love the concept because especially in the winter, I don't like getting out of my car unless I absolutely have to. My best friend recommended I try the island bowl to start. My favorite thing about it is the color, a vibrant pink color from the pitaya. It contains a mixture of granola, pitaya, banana, blackberries, coconut shavings & coconut water; Possibly more ingredients but that is just what is visible. It has somewhat of a yogurt texture but with a little more crunch because of the granola(home-made too btw)...Seriously AMAZING! I could literally eat it every day and never get sick of it. You would think there is sugar in it because it is perfectly sweet, most of the time if you blend fruit by itself it is really bitter without sugar. Next, i popped inside on my lunch break and had their Greek salad which was delicious! The dressing was wonderful, not too thick, not to thin and the greens were so fresh and crunchy! The chicken had just the right amount of seasoning and wasn't dry or bland. After that, I hadn't been back for a while because of work and such but allergy season is upon us and I am one of the lucky ones who breaks out in hives. I then decided that I should clean up my diet a little and attempt to lead a healthier lifestyle because certain foods can make my hives worse like excessive salt & sugar. My friend then had me try the island greens juice which literally looks like grass in a bottle. However, it tastes nothing like grass and is actually much better than other green juices that i have tried in the past...I am slowly adjusting to the tastes of organic health foods but with the help of Fruits & Roots I am now more open to the change:) Plus, if you have any health issues and you need a customized juice, Patricia(the owner) is an open book and eager to help, she recommended turmeric for my hives and now I make sure its in every juice I order and it helps:) Thanks pretty ladies! Two thumbs up! xoxo"}
{"text":"Loving the new location! It's much more spacious than the other one. Holiday decorations all around! If you're looking for a healthy vegan, vegetarian or all over healthy place in Vegas! Here is the place to go! They also have a drive thru if you're in a hurry!   I ordered the Hummus wrap with toasted chickpeas since that's my favorite item on the menu. It's filling and definitely worth it."}
{"text":"If you want amazing a√ßa√≠ bowls, this is the place! I tend to get the pure bowl because it's classic and their granola tastes amazing, but I've tried protein bowl and earth bowl previous times. Protein bowl, I asked for vegan powder and it did alter the taste and consistent of the bowl, but overall it was ok. Earth bowl was my least favorite, it just wasn't as sweet as I liked and it definitely tasted more green, just not what I was looking for in a a√ßa√≠ bowl.   As for food, Hummus wraps are my go to and they are huge and filling. They have so much ingredients of amazingness and previously I had the Chicken Gyro which was well seasoned, wonderful with the toasted chickpeas and yogurt dressing which was on the side so I can control how much so it doesn't get too saucy in the wrap and leak everywhere.   Also, wellness shots are my always go to when there's that time of feeling down. I always get the Immunity shot since it covers majority of the ingredients that are in the other shots.   They also have an amazing staff & shoutout to Nikki for being an awesome manager! They remember you with a warm welcome every time you come in!"}
{"text":"Looooove this place. Must eat here at least once a week. Their BYO salads and burritos are huge and killer. They have homemade dressings like avocado and Greek tzatziki that are super delicious and flavorful. They have a ton of selection of acai bowls, drinks, and pastries.   Personal favorite... the macachoco smoothie with added almond butter.   Love the staff too. Always super helpful and accommodating. It's expensive though like most health places.   One qualm... they no longer prepare their acai mixtures at their 215 location so you can't change the fruit base. :("}
{"text":"As of recently places like this that serve acai bowls have been popping up, but this one is one of my favorites. This one is close to me, has a drive-thru and owned by a woman! I totally love coming here. Plus the decor is super cute inside. You can go there and actually get some work done if need be. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I want disappointed that the nearest juice and go was way out of my way to work and I some how stumbled across juice and roots and honestly fell in love with the first bite ! They have such great friendly staff and the aca√≠ bowl is amazing ! I've never been a big juice person but the beat drink is AMAZING ! You have to try this place if your on the go and need something fresh on the way to work this is the place to stop !"}
{"text":"Stop in today for lunch & this place is awesome. Super nice & friendly staff, the place is clean & fresh, and the food was on point. Will definitely be returning ASAP to try more on their menu!"}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this place out hearing so many people talk about it. After fasting for a night for an ultrasound, I was so excited to try out Fruits and Roots for my first time and first meal since it was such a close proximity. When I first walked in, it was about 7:35am in the morning, no one greeted me. The girl at the cashier looked at me then went back doing whatever she was doing. The 3 employees working at the time looked either tired, hated their job or unhappy. Another girl took my order and telling her it was my first time here, I wanted to try their fruit bowls. She told me that they have either acai bowl or pitaya bowl so I said \"I'll take the pitaya bowl.\" Then she was like, \"That's an island bowl.\" Okay my bad? Maybe I'm being sensitive but if they had a better attitude I wouldn't feel that way. She made my 'Island Bowl' as well and when it was finished she just handed it to me and turned around, walked away.   The bowl was pretty but the taste was whatever. I do feel healthy eating it though. The pitaya tasted bland and the fruits didn't look that fresh. The bananas had some brown and the strawberries were dull. Thinking the toppings were just on top, I tried to finish it so I can get to the rest of the pitaya on the bottom. However, the entire bowl was filled with granola bites making it so dry. I might come back and try their juices out.. but they were all bottled up pre made before so it's not freshly blended juice that I prefer.  UPDATE: I did come back to give this place a second try. The experience and quality was better than the last."}
{"text":"What a bright happy spot! We were welcomed with the sweet smell of their in house made freshly baked granola. This most delicious granola adorned our perfect Acai Earth Bowl. It was fresh and excellent! The Island bowl is fantastic too. Very bright and refreshing. Even though menu says it comes with blueberries, it doesn't. (Heads up) The Beat It cold pressed juice was also perfectly balanced, refreshing and made the cells dance.   They also offer beautiful made to order salads with or without meat. Dressings are also made in house too. They also offer an excellent variety of nutrient dense smoothies.    On one occasion the atmosphere was pleasant and inviting with 70-80's music at a good volume, (not blasting) so you can still have a good conversation. Sadly, on another occasion music was blasting EDM music and rap music. Doesn't seem appropriate for the \"healing\" environment. On certain days some staff was friendly and generous with smiles and other days no greeting and no thank you. (Little better training needed) Thus 4 stars instead of 5.   If you crave organic goodies that brighten the soul, this is your spot."}
{"text":"I come here for breakfast and they have amazing a√ßa√≠ bowls.  I order the protein bowl with whey protein.  I only had card for payment and they weren't able to process it due to the register being down and they told me breakfast was on them. I offered to come back and pay with cash and they told me not to worry since its issues on their end.  To the manager, keep up the good customer service and thank you for making my day!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this perfect spot yesterday, and couldn't be more pleased!!! The food was absolutely delicious! Even though I sat on the patio and enjoyed my Humus Bowl, I am beyond thrilled that this healthy option has a drive-thru. The patio was quiet, and I loved the plant towers of fruits and vegetables that grew behind me. The price point for the food was more than reasonable, but the coffee and pressed juice prices were a little high. Water was available, by simply grabbing a glass bottle next to the watering station and filling it up. Fresh, healthy food with a side of responsible packaging, love it!"}
{"text":"I am so sadly disappointed! To spend the amount of money they charge on a juice is fine but at least make it fresh to order. Juice loses nutrients as soon as it is exposed to air and it's even stored with air in the bottle! I asked when it was made and I was hesitantly told, \"this morning\". The juice itself was delicious which is why I gave it two stars but not worth the money if it's not providing what the purpose is of drinking fresh pressed juice. I hope they change their ways, I would love to love this place."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!!! Absolutely love the fact that everything is FRESH and ORGANIC!!!  Excellent customer service and friendly staff..."}
{"text":"Best place in town, hands down, for fresh pressed juices! And they have a full menu too. And a drive thru!!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, but the experience leaves something to be desired.  The build-your-own wrap or bowl option is where the issue lies - the board lists how many of each type of option you can choose (1 protein, 1 grain, etc), but not what the choices are.  Some of the items are laid out, but some (like the beans) have covers and there are no labels.  On top of this, rather than walking down the line and making your selections, the cashier insists that I have to choose what I want FIRST, even though I have no way of knowing what is available.  What has ended up happening during both of my visits is a line build-up, and it necessitates going through the order several times before the staff successfully communicates to each other what the order is.  If the purpose of laying out the available ingredients is to allow the customer to choose the items as they go down the line, then the flow of traffic should reflect that. Additionally, each employee should be adequately trained for their position (the staff member on the register clearly had no idea how to use the register, for example).  There is no capacity to handle any kind of volume.    I work nearby, and would come here for lunch multiple times a week if it wasn't a frustrating, 20 minute process to get a wrap containing all of the ingredients I paid for."}
{"text":"Love the food and smoothies here, but I can only give 3 stars due to the extremely long wait times I've experienced during my last three visits in the drive-thru."}
{"text":"my favorite health food place in Vegas. I'm come here twice a week! The staff is so friendly and the food is incredibly fresh. Chicken gyro bowl/salad is a must. Such a reliable place to eat and is definitely worth the price to me. Love you guys."}
{"text":"So good for you...it hurts!! First visit, tried the Powerhouse smoothie, sweet but healthy(?), it hits all the right notes. But service is slow. You'd be wise to order ahead and pick up. Next tried the Maca-choco, which at first tastes just like any ordinary banana smoothie so you might be disappointed. But as I kept drinking it, something magical happened and all of these hidden flavors started to reveal themselves and it ended up tasting more complex than is initially apparent to the taste buds. Also tried the classic acai bowl - not as sweet as others joints but naturally pleasing as any good bowl 'o fruit should be. Get your fruit fix here and never feel guilty."}
{"text":"I am not the person to give bad reviews to anyone. I just think Fruits & Roots needs to be more careful with people w/ allergies. I asked to have banana substituted for mango, as I am allergic to banana. She said yes no problem. Next thing I know, I open up taste it and underneath there's banana. Luckly I had what I always take incase of an emergency. Little bit of advice. Double check before you consume. !!! The lady did replace our bowl but if there was ever another case like this.. who knows how the next person will be.!!"}
{"text":"Service was great! Acai bowls were excellent. All the juices we tried were refreshing and well balanced. Give them a try. Support local."}
{"text":"Honestly this place is amazing. I've never ordered anything bad, everything is fresh and made to order. Every time I come here the people working are upbeat and friendly and very knowledgeable when it comes to what they are making.  But I seriously don't understand why establishments (especially one like this that is solely thriving off the hard work of the employees) doesn't allow you to tip on a credit card. I never go anywhere with cash on me and I never spend less than $50 every time I come here. It's unfair to the employees who are ensuring that I keep coming back.   Today I ordered 2 bowls, a wrap, a smoothie and a juice and the girls working had it all bagged up and ready to go in less than 10 minutes. And of course, I open my wallet and don't have a single cash dollar to give them.   Other than that, this business has not one thing to improve. From now on I'll make sure I don't come unless I have 20% in cash to tip because the girls today DEFINITELY deserved it."}
{"text":"I love their acai and superfruit bowls. I've tried their Pure, Island and classic bowls. It has the perfect amount of sweetness, which is not overly sweet, and they are very generous with the toppings."}
{"text":"Went to Fruits & Roots right after they opened. I was looking at the menu for a while since I'm a picky eater. I was talking to a worker there who was very helpful and made a bunch of suggestions. She took her time and wanted to know what food I liked and made suggestions based off of that. After I received my drink she followed-up to ask about how I liked it. It was great!  Well, it turned out I was talking with the owner! She did this with everyone who walked in. That impressed me that she was in the place helping out and really cared what the customers thought.  Now I always make it a point to stop there when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"First time. Personable service. You can make your own bowl!  Grub Hub delivers for them I believe."}
{"text":"I was feeling super under the weather with a big event coming up, so my friend recommended that I come here. I got an immunity shot (Ginger, lemon, turmeric, cayenne, oil of oregano) as well as an Apple Spice juice (Apple, lemon, extra ginger) steamed with a pinch of cinnamon as recommended by the girls working.  Overall amazing service, the girls helped me out a tons. The steamed apple spice was amazing, and the shot cleared me up instantly! Loved my experience."}
{"text":"The selection of food and drinks was great! I follow a strict paleo diet, and there were a lot of great options for me. Everything was organic and gluten free, and not to mention delicious. The ambience inside is also really nice, comfortable, and very clean. The gummy bear smoothie was amazing, and we took some cold pressed juices to go for later. The Ginge Juice was so refreshing and delicious! The price is also on the high end, but for me the quality was worth paying for. However, when we walked in we were not greeted by even one of the several employees behind the counter, and stood looking at the menu for several minutes (since we had never been there), before finally asking someone for help to answer some questions and to get recommendations. The girl who took our order seemed slightly impatient and maybe annoyed with us for taking so long. But other than the lack of hospitality, I would give it another shot to try out more of the food options."}
{"text":"To say I LOVE this place is an understatement. I was born and raised in Las Vegas and my mom was from Israel..she used to juice when we were younger juice before it became a thing you could actually go and buy at a restaurant! I had yet to find anything that matched my mom's skills until I came to Fruits and Roots!   ALL GREEN EVERYTHING is my go to especially when I am needing that pick me up and lacking on my veggies! Training, working full time I know I can get what I need from that juice!  You can order it by the bottle or ask for ice in a cup lately that is what I have been doing you can even order a small size!  My favorite item to order on the menu is the Gyro Wrap....I am Moroccan so I can be picky about this also...I took one bite and tasted a roasted garbanzo bean and almost lost my mind haha ok maybe not lost my mind but fell in love! The tortilla is so light and the seasoning on the chicken is so good! If you are looking for a more low carb option get this same gyro flavor in a salad bowl version! The tahini dressing is everything and everything is so fresh...It's a flavor explosion in your mouth and so delicious! You will often see me there with my BFF grabbing lunch, meeting clients, or just hanging out with our juice! So happy to have this in Las Vegas!! Oh and make sure to try the special home made treats like the Quinoa crispy....with an espresso....ughhhh..soooo goood!!! xoxo"}
{"text":"I was excited to see a new location same great quality and it is a little larger which is nice... I always order the same thing All green everything and gyro wrap Order the drink in a cup with ice it is actually a little cheaper!! And still delicious."}
{"text":"I really admire the design of this cafe. It's super cute and artsy. The food is a bit pricey, like most other organic food cafes. I ordered the Avocado Toast and it was $8. Very small piece of toast, but it was still delicious! The workers were very nice and friendly. It's a nice place to study. Not too loud, not too quiet. I would come back here again!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but staff need to get it together. I have been here three times. They only can give you juice samples of what they have open. Pressed for juice and the juice standard will let you sample everything so you know that you will enjoy your juice. The computer system is completely off as they have entered my information every single time I've went and I still was not in the system (irritating). They tried to charge me for two things while paying in the drive through when I only ordered one and I had to ask for my receipt. Fail! Will not be back"}
{"text":"Love this place. Drive thru makes it so convenient. There Vegan Caesar wrap and bowl are my favorites.  The Vegan cheesecake is also incredibly tasty and doesn't disappoint. I've had several of there smoothies and all of them have been great. So happy they opened another location on blue diamond because it's closer to my house."}
{"text":"Awesome service and delicious healthy food and drinks... just wish they had one on the NW side."}
{"text":"Yummy! Got turned on to this place by a friend and I have to say I love it. I am hooked on the island bowl and carrot juice. Would go everyday if I could."}
{"text":"I love this place! The staff is awesome and everything I have tried so far has been on point. I love that everything is organic and freshly made, i don't mind waiting if its quality food and service!!"}
{"text":"Came here this morning for breakfast with my son! It's a wonderful place because it has a drive thru!   Only fresh press juice and smoothie in town with a drive thru! The walnut banana bread is amazing! Come early because the gluten free cheesecake sells out fast! Every smoothie I've tried here is awesome! They even have a Togo section of snacks ! Carrots/zucchini with hummus and a fruit with yogurt. Both in cups that fit right into your cup holder!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for an easy healthy place with an amazing staff than fruits and roots is your place! I ordered the apple spice and a pure bowl, which were both extremely fresh and delicious. The people there are so nice and helpful and really make fruits and roots a great place to have a meal!"}
{"text":"The service crew is always thoughtful- I have come here several times and each time I am very happy.   Today, though, wasn't so much about Fruits and Roots as it was the mishap of an order that went from EAT24 to the store.  My wraps were still salads!  When the service member and I compared notes- my yelp order and what they received from the program- we could see that I was charged the correct amount but the order was not correct on the store's side.   What I want to celebrate is the great food and the willingness of the staff to get the order corrected immediately and still do it all with a SMILE!  This is very important given the fact that they did get it right according to the info they had on their side."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The staff is always so friendly and helpful. I regular the drive thru after my morning workouts while my daughter sleeps and my usual is the protein acai bowl and iced almond latte. I seriously could have both every day!! The iced almond latte is ridiculously good and I usually finish it by the time I'm down the street. It's addicting and the best coffee I've ever had! I had the chicken quinoa salad the other day and it was amazing! Overall this place might be a little pricy but it is SO worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I love everything about it. Not only is it the best for cold press juices but they have a wide variety of other options! It's super convenient being that it's right off the 215 and they have a drive thru. Just had the Earth bowl (acai bowl) and it's so yummy!!"}
{"text":"Ok...holy moly...they've done it again...created this amazing Vegan Cheesecake with different glazes...I've tried the strawberry and the pineapple...and I wish I could eat this everyday!!! I'm currently trying to cut meat out of my life, and didn't realize how delicious food can be...you have to get in here and try it..."}
{"text":"I go here often, but lately, it's been rather disappointing. I always get the same thing: Vegan Caesar bowl, hummus cup, and an All Green Everything juice. The first time I ever tried the vegan Caesar bowl, I was in love. Everything was fresh and cooked perfectly. I absolutely LOVE the dressing btw. I started ordering it regularly and that's when it started becoming a hit or miss. The last two times have been a complete miss. The black rice has been severely undercooked, it hurt my teeth to chew. Also, the chickapeas have been chewy, not the nice crunchy texture that I was introduced to. Sometimes they skimp on the avocado too. It is not a cheap salad, so my expectations are a bit high. The juice is great, I have no complaints. As for the hummus cups, if you go towards the latter part of the day, they are likely to be sold out. Although, one day I tried  to order a hummus cup and the lady said they were out, then she told me that they were out of black beans for my vegan Caesar and asked if I'd like to add hummus for protein. . .. strange. The last thing that I wanted to address was the wait time. If you don't have a minimum of 12 - 15 min to spare for a drive-thru, I wouldn't bother."}
{"text":"Despite some kinks, Fruits and Roots is pretty good. The service is friendly, the decor is cute, and the acai bowls are made just right.  They offer up the usual healthy variety with juices, smoothies, salads, and then some. The Sweet Asian salad was delicious and clean, and I love the fact they put their detox on the greens. My boyfriend, on the other hand, got the Chicken Quinoa and the chicken looked dehydrated af. So either we went on an off day or its always that dry.  The acai bowls are amazing here. The base is delicious and the toppings complement it well. Plus, they blend it up with acai fruit (rather than just the juice) so it's packed with antioxidants. Definitely recommend the Earth Bowl plus almond butter topping.   Downsides to this place is that it's pretty pricey (on par with other similar healthy joints) and the consistency is not quite there yet. One of out of three times, the acai bowl we got just wasn't the same. It wasn't as sweet which is probably hard to control based off the fruit without using sugar additives and there was huge chunks of frozen solid smoothie not blended in.  Overall, decent health option if you're in the area ~"}
{"text":"I don't like leaving this place a low star review because the food and drinks are excellent; however, after swallowing a fair amount and spitting out a handful of glass almost two weeks ago I still cannot bring myself to go back in. The staff needs to properly check the pressed juice bottles better in the future. This could be a life and death situation for customers! I'm lucky nothing bad had happened from swallowing the glass because the pieces were thankfully small enough to pass through my digestive system but fearful to go back."}
{"text":"All the juices and foods are amazing, the staff is friendly, informed and helpful - it's just hard to get their attention sometimes. Drive through is awesome when someone is paying attention to it."}
{"text":"Delicious and nutritious fruit and acai bowl selections, great to have a healthy foodie option near my workplace."}
{"text":"Wow! I've long been saying that I wish I could find an amazing salad place close to my house. I've also been saying it would be great to have a healthy drive-thru. Fruits and Roots has both! I called my order in (before I knew about the drive-thru), and my food was ready just a few minutes later, when I arrived. The girl who helped me was so nice! I ordered the chicken gyro salad, and the ingredients were so fresh. I felt good even after eating the whole thing myself. There is a little kick to it, which I loved, but my kids would have called it \"spicy.\" The only one little thing I could complain about is that it didn't have the roasted chickpeas that were mentioned on the list of ingredients. I was looking forward to that as an alternative to croutons. Regardless, I'll definitely be back soon (like, tomorrow soon)"}
{"text":"Update: went and gave them a second try after the bug mishap. It was super loud due to construction and the place didn't have any seating for us so we had to take our bowls to go.   We thoroughly checked that flower In the island bowl this time and saw there was no bug. I was able to try it this time and I actually liked the pitaya. The a√ßa√≠ bowl was as good as I remember from last time. The staff was super friendly as well.   Was craving an a√ßai bowl so I asked my husband to go out and grab one. Since we moved a little bit further from our favorite spot we both decided that we'd try a this place.   We ordered one acai bowl, an island bowl, and an apple spice drink. The acai bowl was good but small. There were pumpkin seeds in it which was different than any of the other bowls I've had.   The island bowl is made with pitaya which was pretty and pink. When my husband opened this bowl there was a yellow flower in the middle of the bowl. Under the flower was a little rolly Polly bug!!! He wasn't upset about it being there, but I was. I hate bugs in my food! It was too late to go back there plus he never got a receipt. So he decided he would just eat the bowl. I was pretty angry about it even after he let the bug go outside.   Overall, the acai bowl was good. But I'd think again before going back because just seeing that bug in my food made me not want to go back and try anything else."}
